2,Boring,"I know this book won the Pulitzer Prize and I know that Philip Roth is considered as a great contemporary writer, and I am not questioning the point in any sort of way, but I am afraid I am one of those who did not enjoy reading American Pastoral.The story in itself is interesting, and sure enough Philip Roth has a specific style that is mostly enjoyable, but I cannot stand the repetitive pattern he uses in his story.On and on it goes, the same event is narrated again and again, and again.... That bored me ... a LOT. And even the interesting writing style did not manage to make the read pleasurable to me.What seems to be a particularity of Roth's style from what I recall of my reading The Human Stain and that The San Fransisco Chronicle describes as ""At once expansive and painstakingly detailed""... is exactly what I did not like in the novel and made my reading of it ""painstakingly"" achieved. I would probably have dropped it if I did not have to read it for study purposes."
2,good in the beginning; snore by the end.,"At the beginning of the book I was so absorbed that I couldn't put it down, but by the middle, it was just so unrealistic and boring. The women in this book are not portrayed well, at all, and there are so many misplaced scenes. I had a lot of high hopes for this book because I couldn't stop reading it, but in the end I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters."
2,why is this a classic???,"Torture is the word that comes to mind when discribing this book .First off the first hundred pages are about almost nothing ,just saying the same thing over and over and over agian....Then the second part of the story is imagined...Please give me a break Im half way through this book and the main reason im finishing it is becouse I paid $15 bucks for it and cant get a new book till Monday.....I hope it gets better i couldnt get much worse...BOOOOO for this piece of babble......I will give a full review when I finish the book"
1,Painful!,"I hated this book! The book was bogged down with boring details that did not add to the story (ie: multiple pages on how to make leather gloves). I didn't feel that any of the characters were likeable or even worth caring about. Our book club read the book so I forced myself to read the entire book, and disliked the book as much at the end as I did at the beginning."
1,Deadly,"Against my better judgment, I began to read it - at the urging of a friend - who wanted me to explain it to her. Previously, I had worked with her on reading Proust and again on reading Faulkner.I regret the time I spent on the first 80 pages before I threw it away. Roth's Pulitzer Prize winner is wordy, whiny, deadly."
5,sounding awesome after all these years,the cd of this dvd is coming out in jan.if you are a fan of this band i have 4 words for u just buy it awesome!!!!!
5,Great Takes From the Great Lakes,"For people who visit the Lake Erie Islands this CD can take you to Erie Island Summers any day of the year. From beautiful slow songs to upbeat comedy songs they all take you to that special island place, Put-In-Bay. For those who have never been to the Bay all you have to do is buy the CD, turn it on, close your eyes and Ray takes you there! This CD is a must for those who like real music and songs about real people and places by a real singer. Waves is a must for all summer ritual lovers both young and old!"
5,MY FAV BAND.,"DEFTONES ARE MY FAV BAND, TO ME THEY ARE EVERYTHING I LOVE ABOUT ROCK, METAL AND ALTERNATIVE MUSIC. DEFTONES SACTO, CA."
5,Pleasant Surprise,My daughter loves the Deftones so I thought I'd treat her to this. She hadn't hear of it before. It made a wonderful Christmas present.
4,review from Synthesis,"While most of these songs can still be found on my parents' hard drive, downloaded from my days as a Napster junkie, the Deftones' B-Sides & Rarities offers some new, unheard surprises, making it the perfect fan homage. Chino Moreno and Far's Jonah Matranga deliver a powerful duet on Jawbox's ""Savory,"" which is then followed by a cover of the Cocteau Twins' ""Wax and Wane."" However, I'm really not sure if the (hopefully) ironic cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Simple Man"" really meshes well with the rest of the tunes. With the exception of a few acoustic versions of their more popular songs, B-Sides & Rarities plays out more like a cover album than anything else, but in no way am I complaining.Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"
3,"A great deal of Information, But shallow","I felt that William Teire wrote a great deal of information that he understands, but didn't always make it understandable for the learner. An example is his chapter on map reading. He talks about townships and quadrants without really expalining to the reader how to read a map. With a little more in depth work in some areas of this book it could be the best handbook out there."
1,Still waiting,"I ordered this book on March 5th, it is April 17th today and I still haven't received the book I paid for. I have tried to contact the seller a few times and have yet to receive a response."
3,Best English to Chinese Dictionary - but still not great,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this dictionary is one of the very few English-Chinese dictionaries compiled with English, rather then Chinese, speakers in mind. As such it's much more comprehensive than anything else I've come across. However it's by no means complete - in fact I couldn't find two of the first three words I tried to look up (""migraine"" and ""facecloth"".)It does have plenty of examples, along with pinyin pronunciation which is very desirable. However, I have frequently found the examples confusing as often the Chinese word used in the example is different from the single word entry and there is no explanation about the reason for difference.Despite these weaknesses, this is still a helpful resource for English speaking learners of Chinese."
5,Love!,"I hate, hate, hate buying bottles of water--such a waste of plastic--but it's hard to make room for my Kleen Canteen in my business luggage. But this bottle folds down so that it takes up virtually no space, I can keep it in my carry-on so that I can fill it with water after going through airport security... and it's cute!I've taken it on 5-6 trips so far and it seems very durable. Definitely recommend."
5,Perfect companion for your Katadyn system,"Compact, lightweight, and strong! I keep one of these bottles in my Katadyn Hiker Pro kit. It easily fits into the kit's bag. I pump the water into the this bottle and add the MicroPur tablets so the water can sit BEFORE I add it to my hydration bladder. I also keep another bottle in my backpack for times when I base camp. Nothing like having a 2 liter bottle of treated water available for cooking and such.Sure, they are pricey, but they are ultra-compact and light as a feather. You'll say goodbye to hard plastics forever."
4,Last bottle I ever bought.,"This water bottle is incredible. It has gone on every adventure with me since I purchased it almost 2 years ago. It is incredibly durable and has an amazing ability to preserve temperature. Use it only for water and your water will always taste fresh. I have dropped this thing, kicked it, forgotten it frozen for several weeks, put it through all sorts of hell and it's still good as new. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not the easiest bottle to clean, but as long as you only use it for water that shouldn't be too much of a problem anyway."
3,"Compact, but not the best design for joggers","First-I returned it since it came without a cap--poor quality control. Otherwise, it's a great bottle and good for travel. Note it's thinner than a normal 1L bottle, meaning it's naturally very tall and when full is too awkward to take for a jog--especially since there is no handle."
4,Great Read.,"You will not get bored of reading this book! It is a fascinating story wich you will find yourself reading all night. The story is basically about a billionaire, Harry Standford, who dies and his greedy childrens were left to his fortune. But because of his reckless handling of the business prior to his death, it went out of business. His childrens, who were looking forward to being billionaires, find themselfs getting nothing in the end"
2,Sloppy,"The plot lacks integrity. There are so many errors that made me wander if the book had been edited at all! Also, I believe that the author should've spent an extra 50-100 pages to better develop characters and settings. Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading the book with its many twists & turns. Mr. Sheldon seems to be a very talanted story teller who just needs a better editor. This was my first Sidney Sheldon book, and it would have been the last except that based on the good reviews that I've read here on Amazon , I'm willing to give his ""Master of the Game"" or ""Rage of Angles"" a try."
5,love it!,"I love this cookbook. After cooking from it for about a year and a half, it is definitely my ""go to"" cookbook whenever I'm looking to make a special meal. It has turned me on to so many new flavors and has influenced me to try combining flavors in interesting and unexpected ways. My favorite recipes are the cilantro pesto, the rosemary garlic foccacia, the white bean hummos with sage, Monk's curry with homemade curry paste, and the lime pepita sugar cookies. Some of the recipes are quite labor-intensive, but definitely worth it for the great food. I'm planning a trip to Victoria for the sole purpose of going to the Rebar restaurant!"
1,long complicated recipes,I got this cookbook off a referral from a friend. When I recieved it and started flipping through it I realized that almost every recipe has unusual ingredients and most all of them seemed very time consuming. The recipes sounded yummy but at this stage of life I am not looking for long and complicated dinner recipes.
5,Pearls of Management Wisdom,"Max Depree shares with his readers to art of being human. He communicates the complexities of leadership in wonderful vignettes... a clean, easy read. If your looking for management theory or in-vogue consulting models, forget it. Straight to the core with what we all aspire to and so very few achieve. I hand it out to each new hire."
2,Revolutionary Leadership?,"Despite what appears to be the vast majority of opinions on this book, I found this book very difficult to get through. What De Pree writes as ""authoritative"" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. ""Man's Search For Meaning"" is a FAR more compelling leadership read...."
2,Ugh,This book was useless. Not sure who would actually get anything out of this. Its full of vague general platitudes. If your looking for any concrete information on what makes a good leader look elsewhere.
5,Any guides by brady Games is good...,The best guides the buy are by Brady Games...they are the most helpful when stuck in a game...they stend to include lots of picures unlike some of the other guides. The signature series look espicially sharp!
2,Save your money.,"I had high hopes for this, but it was a let down. While the front of it stays up great, the back rolls down. And unless you are an octopus, good luck pulling the back part up. Size is not the issue. If I ordered it any bigger, it would have been too big. Think long and hard before you order it, because you can only return it unused, which is pointless because how do you know it fits until you try it on!?"
2,Not as good as other Spanx products,"This item did not slim me at all. In fact, it made my post-c-section tummy more noticeable because clothes cling to it and it also has a harder, rounder look. If you are trying to avoid jiggle, it works, but otherwise, a waste (or waist haha) of money."
1,"Not for small figure woman with 30"" waist!","I am 5'2"", small frame, with a 30"" waist and obvious tummy. I ordered Spanx small (the smallest they have) and it doesn't change a thing (I use a measuring tape to check my before and after difference). Disappointed. Wish they make XS and XXS."
2,didn't really work,"This sounded like an ideal product because I could use it with my own bra. However, like some of the other reviewers said, it's not so easy to get on, the straps are stupid, but if you don't use them, the suit rolls down and hurts, and don't even think about going to the bathroom! It works, but like all my Spanx, it doesn't really live up to the claims because it rolls up, it rolls down, and i'm always adjusting something.Still, I must admit I haven't found anything that slims me down so well...but there must be something else out there."
1,Save your money...,"I was thrilled the whole week waiting on these Spanx to come in, only to find myself disappointed. I have 2 kids I wasn't hoping for a miracle or anything like that. But I thought at least it'll help my shape out, instead it actually made my upper body look weird! I'm 5'4 weighing in at 160 & I got the medium size.... Waste of hard earned money.. :/ So just save your $71+ on something worth that money"
4,Happy Cust.,I am very happy with my purchase of the Warning double burner. The only thing I don't like about the burners is that the smaller burner doesn't get as hot as the big one (which I knew already from the description). This really only poses a problem if I am cooking two things that need to cook at high heat at the same time. I am thinking about getting the Warning single burner as well. Overall I am really satisfied with this product. The big burner gets really hot really fast. I can boil pasta within a few minutes. Medium sized potatoes took about 10-15 minutes to boil. I also have Hamilton Beach 31199R Countertop convection oven. Between my burners and countertop oven I can make awesome meals.
4,Waring DB60 double burner,"arrived very quickly. works fine. a little slow to heat up, but once heated very efficient. hope it lasts, it is very light weight."
2,Not hot enough. Slowwwwwww for cooking anything.,"Very disappointed in this product after reading great reviews from others. The large burner does virtually nothing. It gets warm-to-hot, but it won't boil anything. The small burner is more effective, but still takes FOREVER to heat anything up to cooking temperatures. I had more luck boiling stuff on my charcoal grill. Waste of money, in my opinion."
2,Not worth the money,Have had burners for a year and 7 months and it has died worked fine for the first 6 months then large burner would not turn on unless you played with it now it has finally gone to kitchen heaven
1,does not boil water,"I had a pot of water on the burner for hours and could not get it to boil, even with the cover on. I am very disappointed! Don't know if it is a manufacturers defect or just poor design. Unfortunately, I had it for a few months before I tried it so now I cannot return it for a full refund."
5,Waring Pro SB30 1300-Watt Portable Single Burner,This Is One Of THE Best Burners That There Is .It Can Boil Water pretty quick & you can cook almost anything . The ONLY FAULT I SEE Is That There Is No Low Heat Setting even when you have it on 1 it still stays hot but its not A big Deal as long as you watch it while your cooking . I'm Thinking about getting the one with 2 burners NEXT But I Love This One It Cooks Just Like An Electric Stove Dam Near
3,Liked it while it worked,"Broke after 7 months. It no loner turns on or heats up. I didn't use it too much, but it worked well..while it worked."
3,"For the price it is ok, but quality is not very good","Reasonable price but the quality is not so good. After a month of use ( about 7-10 times of cooking on it ) there was a big crack on the stove surface, as the heat goes up the crack becomes bigger. Contacted Amazon and got a partial refund. Also, it takes a while to heat up. I got a different brand stove after this and it has been working fine."
2,It's stainless steel but the plastic sides melted in its third use,All the above reviews are correct.However; none of the reviewers mentioned that the cheap plastic side walls of the burner melted. This Pro Burner should have been all stainless steel.
3,Hot plate yes-true stove NO!,"The Waring Pro SB30 portable single burner appears well made and is attractively finished, too bad it won't boil a quart of water!. I purchased this unit to do some porch cooking during the summer. It works well enough for simmering and heating but mine will NOT bring water to a boil no matter how long you let the unit warm up, or how long the pot is on high. One hour on high and the temperature of 1.5 quarts of water was 176 degrees. Twenty more minutes - hey guess what the water is 174 degrees! You would think 1300 watts could manage to get a T-Fal 2 quart saucepan with 1.5 quarts of water up to 212 degrees in an hour and twenty minutes."
4,Awesome!!!!,I love this double burner. I live in a small efficency without a stove and this works really well. It has made cooking a pleasure again compared to the white models from a large box store.
2,why the slooowwwww ship,GeezI ordered this because I needed it. I just now reviewed the ship date. They should mention that it takes two months to arrive.VERY POOR customer satisfier there.I will look for alternatives before I cancel the order!post script. i didnt cancel the order ANDamazon then shipped this product faster by three weeks. BUT just before shipping cancelled the entire order as my credit card had expired. of course they gave me 24 hours to respond but I work 13 hour shifts and missed the first email. So again I am waiting .The product is cancelled and i have to reship.good going amazon
1,very bad smell,when in use this item smells super toxic. i have been using it for two months so you would think it had off gassed. i don't know what the problem is but it's really really bad. and it smells only when on.
3,EYE like it!!,"OK, let's get real. TRACKMAN isn't going to win any awards. TRACKMAN isn't going to win a weekend race at the box office. But TRACKMAN isn't as bad as some of the reviewers have made it out to be. It's really pretty good, especially considering TRACKMAN is a Russian attempt at horror.The plot is fairly simple. A small group of band robbers take hostages and decide to escape through a series of underground tunnels. Great plan!! Right? Wrong. Very bad idea. A psychopath with a fixation on eyeballs lives in the tunnels and he's eager to add to his collection.Let me state that I am not a fan of the ""torture porn"" variety horror that seems to be flooding the market in the last few years. I prefer a more subtle approach to horror. But TRACKMAN had it's gory moments and the suspense level was fairly intense.All in all, I'd say give TRACKMAN a chance. Judging from TRACKMAN, I'd say the future of Russian horror looks very bright!Just stay out of the dark."
1,messy!,I was excited to save some time doing my eyebrows with this product but instead it was really messy and looked like I painted my eyebrows. Never going to purchase again.
1,Pretense can only cheat that far!,"The author failed to acknowledge the decisive influence of the Chinese tradition to the rest of the world.His pretense that he knew something about Chinese tradtion is laughable. For example, he showed a few pictures about Chinese furniture. But none of those shown are considered good.His claim of innocence, such as little is known about the Chinese tradition is a sterotype claim of those with a strong indealolgy."
2,One of the worst ever....,"This movie will make you laugh. It is not even remotely scary and the ""gore"" is just laughable. It does have its gratuitous sex scenes with hilarious ""sexy"" music. But the hardly attractive women seem like they wish they were doing their nails instead of getting nailed. I had to turn this movie off after 45 minutes. This is one of the worst attempts at cheesy horror ever made...yet I rented part 2 for some reason! Ha...we shall see if they can redeem themselves."
3,"Nasty, cheesy fun.","One word - Tiffany Shepis. Oops, that's actually two. If you are a fan of hers check this out if not you might not like this movie. If you like b-movie cheese however, this is a kind of cool flick. I liked it better than the sequel;The Death Factory Bloodlettingwhich had no Tiffany Shepis. WTF?"
5,"Great, practical advice!","We just finished this book as a 5-week study. Lisa is very honest and very practical in the book. I truly wish I had this book when my first child was born. This is a great babyshower gift! We easily get caught up in the child and neglect so often the ""mommy"". You will be blessed by reading this book!"
1,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews, I wondered if we had all read the same book. There was very little to like about the main character. She had a very difficult beginning, but the way she went about ""raising"" herself above her beginnings was not admirable as far as I was concerned. She began her ""rise"" by prostituting herself in order to get her first loan. Later on her business dealings, especially with foreigners, were unscrupulous, i.e. insisting on meeting while they were suffering from jet lag in order to gain an advantage. If you enjoy a book having a bitchy main character who has an affair with a much older married man, then this book is for you. I was very disappointed. Normally I enjoy Sidney Sheldon, but there was very little in this story that I really liked."
5,Sidney Sheldon suceeds again,"Sidney Sheldon I think is one of the best authors ever! I have written to him several time, and he has personally written me back. I read this book in days because I really got in to it. I young women starts a big building business. She becomes obsessed with it. When accidents start heppening, and affairs come in, she has to wonder, are they really accidents, and is really safe to have theses affairs?"
3,it was $50 for a reason..,"I wish I would have read the review's before I purchased it, it does suck up dirt well but everything gets blown around. Papers on a desk, etc.. gone! It's the weirdest thing.."
2,I think he could have done soooo much better,Sure the transitions are smooth..but c'mon they last a total of 4-5 seconds...cut on the crossfader and you're in just as long as you can beatmatchalthough I will give props to Boy George for his inclusion of the garage themes Call It Fate and Let Me Be Your Fantasy..he might be a better live DJ but if you want to buy the songs on this CD for their eclectic appeal...by all means do so..the mix is good in bringing out some of the less popular tunes
2,Concerned,Yoga for Healthy Bones has lots of unreferenced information. Some of the poses that are recommended as safe are not considered safe in other sources for osteoporosis clients. Good pictures and description of poses which makes this a handy resource.
3,Buyers beware...,"If you are not a Saterday Night Live fanatic, you might what to give this one a pass. Truly only for collectors."
5,Should be a required text in every school and before voting,"Every Americsan should read this book. It should be required in every government class at any level. Judge Bork demonstrates that he truly understand our Consitution and how it must stand as the rule by which government is limited and the power and freedom of the people maintained and protected.The Tempting of America is simple enough for any literate adult to undertstand; legal expertise is not required. What may surprise many people is that he is against judicial activism by anyone--the left or the right. The Constitution is the people's contract with an elected government and it is up to the PEOPLE to change it, not a few black robes."
2,Great Story; Hard to Read!,"I think the lost colony of Roanoke is an interesting story. Thank Goodness! Otherwise, I'd have never gotten through this book! The writing style is abysmal. The story Miller paints is confusing, backed up with limited evidence and presented in a manner which is disjointed. On a more focused basis, the sentences themselves are chopped and rearranged in order to include authentic source quotes. I understand the author wants to represent the source material, but this is over-done and only serves to create sentences that flow like a swamp in summer. Who edited this?This is a library book. I wouldn't buy it unless you are a true fan of the Roanoke story."
5,Where was this book when I studied 11th grade U.S. history?,"Honest to goodness, this book amazed me, mesmerized me, entertained me, educated me and left me wondering what else in history my teachers got wrong. Not that it's their fault. It's just that Lee Miller and her calibre of historical research were not around all those years ago.Picking through the bread crumbs of more than four centuries of historical Hansels and Gretels, Miller deduces not only what happened to the colonists abandoned at Roanoke (yes, abandoned--they originally were to land at Jamestown), but convincingly so. At a certain part in the telling, you'll have goosebumps.Additionally, she boldly declares, with facts in hand, why. But not without a twist or two of Elizabethan palace intrigue.Read Roanoke. You'll never look at history the with the same eyes."
5,Wonderful Steve Irwin Figure!,"This is a lovely toy for kids, young and old!! Also, this is great, if you want to collect Steve Irwin memorabilia. I received my Steve Irwin figure very quickly!!"
1,Worst children's book ever,Holding a gun to a terified woman's head in a children's picture book is totally inappropriate for young children. What were the publisher's thinking?
3,"Fantastic, Wonderful Book......for the first 300 pages....","Even though the ending seemed at times that Erdman had lost interest, or perhaps creativity, I enjoyed his work very much. Set Up gave the reader some insight as to what goes on in the world of high finance and the perils of deceit in this arena. The book was certainly good enough that I will try another of Mr. Erdman's titles....I just hope for an ending on par with the beginning!"
4,One of the best financial thrillers to date!,"Erdman's style of storytelling is in itself unique and interesting, revealing the plot in a dynamic way not common to most writers. The plot is compelling, the financial thriller at its best! A solid Four Star book."
4,Seems farfetched,"It seems so farfetched, but on the other hand, It the President of the US can do things like.... why not?"
4,I loved this book,"I read this book very fast, enjoying every page. I loved the different characters, especially Tara and Katherine. It was so relieving to experience Tara finally leaving her terrible boyfriend. I am waiting for Marian Keyes to write book number 2 about these three people. I want to know what happens next. The ending has so much hope in it."
3,"Not my favorite, but sort of entertaining.","I liked all of Ms. Keyes books much better than this one. This one was fine, just not as funny and quirky as the others. I found Katherine to be a complete uptight woman and it got on my nerves after a while. Even when she found something good in Joe, she dropped it in no-time flat on seeing Lorcan again in hopes of finding closure. That is just being heartless and emotionless to dismiss Joe in an instant. Not entertaining for the reader, really, after a while. I admired Tara after pretty much the book was close to ending after she grew a backbone, but most of the time she was pathetic for letting herself be manipulated fo ryears by some tyrant of a boyfriend. They way she let Thomas talk to her was unreal.The book just seemed to drone on in comparison to the other books. This just wasn't one of my favorites."
4,Great Chick Lit,"No, it's not Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters. But for this genre, it's very, very good. A trio of Irish transplants make their way through the London singles scene. They deal with love, careers, friendships and family -- the stuff of life. Each character is unique, carefully drawn and relatable. The plot takes some unexpected and even brave twists and turns. While I can't say that it made me laugh or cry, it did entertain and touch me. I recommend it."
3,Am I a hypocrite or what?,"I'm all for growth and change of an artist, but I was looking for the same brain candy I've gotten from other Keyes's books. This book had some of the same rollicking good fun as the other Keyes books I've read (""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married"" and ""Watermelon""); however, I didn't enjoy ""Last Chance Saloon"" nearly as much. I felt like Keyes tried too hard to get deep and philosophical by addressing the issue of Fintan's health and focused too much on sending out the moral of 'carpe diem'. If you're after the latest misery of the month choice, stick with Oprah picks. If you're looking for fun and giggles, look to some of Keyes's other novels."
1,Kept waiting for it to get interesting,"I bought this book thinking it would be one of those great tales about self-discovery, female bonding, adventure. It isn't. It's a dull tale that really doesn't go anywhere. The characters are not terribly engaging, and there is very little resolution to any of the possible storylines brought in during the roadtrip. Wish I hadn't wasted my time."
2,Cat People NOt Purrr-fect,"After not seeing the film for many years, I was excited to finally watch this movie on DVD. The movie is plenty erotic and eerie, but very little substance, action, suspense and gore. The best feature I can say about this movie is its musical score and title song. There are a few moments of chills, but a lot of scenes that are confusing. Quite frankly I was bored to pieces."
4,Nastasja Kinski's at her hottest,"Classic early 80's feel throughout this update to the Val Guest classic. Nastashia Kinski was incredibly hot here; she was at her most attractive in this movie. (The famous anaconda ads were shortly before Cat People.) She also had jet black hair in this film, and luscious full, red lips. The famous violin scene where ol' Droog Meister, Malcolm McDowel strums her with the violin bow was talked about a lot when the movie came out. There is an uncredited musical number sung by David Bowie-- towards the end, as I recall, probably over the end credits. It had the line ""putting out the fire with gasoline."" That was an interesting song. In the begining there are some flashback scenes to the ""origin of the cat people"" that are shot with an Franzetta look."
2,Question about DVD,"Just a general question to other buyers of this DVD -- my copy does't seem to have a working title screen. The disc plays the FBI warning, followed by a black screen. You can play the movie by pressing play, but you cannot use the menu options like on other discs. Anyone else have this problem, is it part of the press run...or do I just have a mildly defective copy?"
2,Totally betrayed,DO NOT rent or buy this based on the preview. Not sultry or arousing. OK 45 min soft core movie but the are A LOT better ones to rent.
4,excellent book,I very much enjoyed this book - my first DuBrul. The character development was good. Intricate woven plot line keep the interest going. My only complaint about the book was that the ending was rather feeble and anti-climactic. I was expecting more from the lead up.But I recommend this to anyone who wants to read an entertaining thriller.
1,IMAGEN HORRIBLE.,LA CALIDAD DE IMAGEN ES PESIMA. PARECE UNA GRABACION PIRATA. PARECE MENTIRA QUE AMAZON PUEDA PONER A LA VENTA Y COBRAR POR UNA CINTA DE UNA CALIDAD NULA.
5,Judo Gi,Great product! My son is five foot ten and weighs 160 pounds and a size 4 fits him perfectly after washing. This Gi will last him a long time since it is so well made. Product was shipped quickly.
4,Good quality little stiff and hard to tough but did not use it in fight yet,Good quality little stiff and hard to tough but did not use it in fight yet
2,Not too good,"Decent enough ideas, and somewhat interesting stories (though kind of farfetched in most cases.) Editing was terrible. Lots of grammar and spelling mistakes. Sometimes the wrong word is used in a sentence. It's to the point of being almost unreadable in some cases. Did anybody at all edit this book? If they did, they should be fired."
1,Unreadable.,"The number of misspellings, sentence fragments, and the overall writing style of a teenage boy who spends entirely too much time playing pseudo-historical video games makes this absolutely unreadable.I am a big fan of alternate history. This is junk."
2,Alternative Historical Timeline outlines,"While the author has some original insights and twists to his outlines, they need further development to make them into real stories."
5,Absolutely Sensational,"This phenomenal tale should have been picked up by a traditional publisher, because its impeccable writing is unrivaled by anyone else's work. The grasp of history and excellent storytelling combine to make an impeccable tale that anyone will enjoy!"
1,cd did not contain the any software drivers!,i wanted a sw driver and cable for my new motorola k1m krzr so i ordered this product. the cd that came with the cable did not contain any drivers!so if you need a driver do not order this product.
5,What a fascinating find! I'm hooked on Jim and his cats!,"I'm hooked! Thank you Lilian Jackson Braun for introducing me to my favourite team. This book has sparked me back into mysteries that I love. I have almost read all the cat series. Those two cats are ""cool-cats""!"
5,Hey Alexandra,"I've been trying to figure out what in the world this book could be about. I mean, if a cat can read backwards, that's pretty incredible. But, as far as I know, a cat reading forwards is impressive, as well. Is this a sequel to ""The Cat Who Could Read?"" Is it the same cat, only now he/she has developed a new skill? Or an all-new cat who one-ups the original reading feline of the first book. Anyway, I'd like to see you again to discuss this and other topics, as well. Hope you're well. J."
4,Another Cozy...,"If your looking for another cozy mystery series to start reading then you have come to the right book....In the first one of many we meet Qwill, an old crime reporter who is landed a new job learning about and writing about the local artist. From here we meet many new and crazy colorful characthers. Everything is going great for our reporter until he meets his future landlord(who everyone but a few dispise) and the murders start happening. From here we meet the famous cat Koko(named for the Cat Who....) who not only can read backwards, but helps solve the mystery. Without giving to much details and plot, this is one that you will have to pick up and find out for yourself.If your definitely in the mood for some light, fun, and fast reading I would suggest giving this a try and then heading on to the next in the series, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern. I know I will....."
4,Not quite there still,"The author has the ability, in all her cat mysteries, to meld an interesting set of characters with a realistic if rather non-specific atmosphere. And I don't have a problem with the whimsical aspect of a cat ""who"" can read (or whatever), although I am somewhat taken aback by the pronoun in the titles, ""who"" as opposed to ""that.""Where this and the other cat books fall a bit short is in the plotting, more specifically in the outcome or denouement. Somehow I feel empty handed as I turn the final page. Without giving away the plot, this was especially true here, in the first of the feline puzzlements. If the cat mysteries just had a better explanation of events and motives, they would be worthy of five stars.Nonetheless, for pure reading enjoyment the cat books are way, way above most current mysteries that are about as much fun to read as watching a toenail fungus cure commercial on TV."
5,A Great Guide For A More Personal Prayer Life,"I found this book to be helpful with the basics in anyone's prayer life. From the beginner to the most advanced this book thru prayer will strengthen your relationship with God. I also think this book is very well written, the author uses great analogies from life and applies them to biblical stories. This book is for you if you are looking to deepen your prayer life."
2,just ok,I expected something better... It may be my own fault I was thinking acrylic was a different material. But it does serve it's purpose so no complaints there..
5,Great collection!,"Only watched BoMC and enjoyed it all over again......great film from Eastwood. Others yet to watch, but know they are also quite good. This collection hits better with the wife, but has points for myself as well."
4,Myst is a great game but NOT an RPG,Myst is a game of strategy. You must use your mind to figure out the puzzles. Sometimes they might be confusing or very tough. But thats just the fun of this great game. Graphics are very nice in Myst. This game should be a must have for anyone who likes strategy-type games.
3,Great music with unfortunate audience distraction,"This is a live recording of a concert performance. The Homeland Quartet is great. The backup music is adequate. There is a member of the audience that is whooping and yelling through most of the performance and is a distraction that is irritating and does a disservice to the performers and the listeners. Unfortunately, I will only listen to this CD once. Not a good investment and cannot recommend it to others who do not care for such whooping and hollering through the entire concert. He should have been asked to pipe down after the first song. Unfortunately, that was not the case and you will have to endure his yelling during the entire CD. This could have been the capstone performance of Ben Speer's career, but sadly it was not."
1,Somebody (...) me !....,"...quick rather than ever have to see a movie like this again! Utter garbage and fluff. No redeeming value whatsoever, no message, no acting. I'm not sure why I let my son talk me into seeing this, but it sure opened my eyes about a whole other world out there, a world of lowlife scum, uninformed and ignorant people."
1,How LAME,"You will like this movie if (1) you enjoy low-brow humor, (2) think hip-hop is the greatest thing since slice cheese, or (3) grew up with MTV.Face it, this story has been played out in the various Cheech & Chong films except now it features new faces from the MTV generation. It is geared for the throngs of minimum wage workers who can only dream of going to an Ivy League school and wreck havoc. If the purpose of the filmmaker was to make a movie about separation of the classes, they have failed miserably.With no respect for the sanctity of higher education and the benefits that such an education brings, we are given a film where drugs/race/sex can be played for all it's stereotypical humor if you use a couple of talentless hacks - who are no better off in a film studio than they are in a recording studio. This is Hollywood commercialization at its finest (or should I say lowest).Save your money people."
1,Terrible,"I realize this is a stoner movie. There is nothing wrong with stoner movies when they're done well. Thing is, this one wasn't done well. The deadly combination of terrible writing AND directing give Method Man and Redman absolutely no hope to succeed. If you want to see a good stoner movie, watch Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back. It's both funny and smart - something this movie is not."
2,Kinda...,"Kinda weak film. I had a few laughs but after a while I realized the film wasn't taking 2 people on a journey to become a bit more civil but rather keep them as is, kinda weak."
2,frat-boy rock,"Great soul-searching tunes for the former frat-boy with his buds in their golf cart. This music lacks the depth and genuine soul of more popular jam bands. They rock to a decent beat, but nothing special or terribly original."
2,two good songs,i made a mistake with this cd thinking that there would be a lot of good music...wrong...don't bother buying the cd just download the two good songs (#1 and #2)
4,Charming Canadian Fare,"I bought this album on a whim, when I saw the cover and subsequently the back which had the Canadian MAPL symbol. Always one to support Canadian music, I had a quick listen at a listening station and decided to purchase it.McClelland has a charming, simple voice similar to Sarah Harmer or Aimee Mann. The songs are catchy, acoustic numbers which, with the right publicity, could become mainstream radio tracks. Standout tracks include ""Glimpse Into Hell"", ""White Lies (stranded in suburbia)"" and ""Rooftop""."
2,Science Fiction for the beginner,"Someone suggested that if I like SF I should read this book. They were mistaken. If you like SF, stay away from this book. Imagine if Tom Clancy wrote a romance novel, or if Stephen King wrote a children's book...get the picture?The plot was typical of SF movies of the 1950s and 70s: Super advanced plant people crash on Earth and a super secret group of world-dominating CEOs try to kill all the witnesses. The aliens want us to clean up our act, the conspiracy group wants to drill for oil in the protected Alaskan wilderness...hey, wait a minute...There is an important lesson given by Mr. Sheldon in this book: Sidney doesn't write good science fiction."
3,Not bad,"I'm very late to the Sidney Sheldon bus, but was a little disappointed in Doomsday Conspiracy. The storyline wasn't bad, but the biggest flaw was the fact that main character had way too many coincidences fall in his favour. If the main character struggled a little more to achieve his objective, I think this book would have been MUCH better.Overall though not a bad read."
1,IDEA VILLAGE ARE CROOKS! BEWARE! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!,I would NEVER NEVER NEVER purchase a product from IDEA VILLAGE. They are criminals! I returned some merchandise and they never gave me credit for it saying they never received the returned merchandise which I know for a fact they did! So you better hope your junky product works or you are SOL!THIEVES! BEWARE! DO NOT buy from them!
1,Idea Village is a rip off,"Promises all kinds of things, ships the basic cheapo only when threatened.AVOID this company!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Item arrived as expected, but it did not work with the model of phone that it claimed to on the web site. I has the wrong connector type. Be careful when ordering, just because it lists your phone type as compatible, it doesn't mean it actually is."
4,Livestrong writ band works as a belt,"We bought our vacuum cleaner 2 and a half months ago to vacuum out dinning room carpet, which we do once a week. Last week the rubber belt broke. This was after around 10 brief uses!!!I went on the Hoover site, and the belt would cost $4, plus $6 dollars shipping....Well it turns out I've replaced it with one of those Livestrong yellow wristbands (now you can even find those types of wristbands of any color selling on the streets by $1) and the vacuum works perfectly!What does that tell us about the cost of their technical support and durability of their parts? I leave it to you to conclude on that."
2,Worthless for pet hair,I got this for getting cat hair off my furniture. It worked great for anout a minute. Even after pulling the hair from the brush and under the belt it failed to work. I even replaced the belt with another one and even tried one of those wristbands someone recommended. No good. If you're buying this to use on cat hair forget it.
2,Sacharrino,"Heavy handed use of synthesizers and vapid lyrics turn these promising collaborations into shopping mall music. Don't waste your time, listen to some original old-school blues."
2,"Excellent vocals, poor otherwise.","After searching for the ""Tales"", I discovered this video. It appears to have been filmed on a low quality video camera brought in by a patron who had a center seat. The camera pans off the main character too many times. My eyes hurt attempting to see who the characters were. The only good statement I can make is Kraus was himself, outstanding. I am still searching for a good quality video of the Tales. I saw one once on PBS but can't locate it."
2,Harvey,"It is no question that the movie itself is a classic.However, Be wary of which Region Code they are sending you - mine came in zone One (that's the US)."
5,Jimmy's Favorite Role - Elwood P. Dowd,"I have been charmed by this movie many times in the 50 years I have been a fan of old movies. Jimmy Stwart loved the part of Elwood P. Dowd so much, he played the role in the movies and on the stage in both London,England and on Broadway. Later in his career, he performed the part again on Broadway to sell out crowds.Elwood and his invisible rabbit pal, Harvey, never fails to put a smile on my lips.Buy this DVD and enjoy this film all over again."
5,great service,I would use seller again. the product was in great shape and came to my home very quickly
1,A Waste of Time & Resources,This DVD was not at all like the review states. It is boring and dull and should be taken off the shelf. I have shared the DVD with several classes I teach and they also feel the same way...what a waste of my money.
5,Works Great,"We went on a long road trip went through rain, hot sun and cool mountain weather and it held up perfectly. Everything stayed dry the bag had alot of room and the straps worked well."
2,Not the product in the image,"I also received the black plastic version of this bag. Watch out for an unusually low price in the ""Amazon warehouse Deals"" section. You get what you pay for. I will, reluctantly, keep it."
4,Cargo Bag,Could be bigger it is about 1 to 2 feet short for the full size cargo hitch. But other than that works great although its not been through anything but dry weather yet.
5,Very happy with this cargo bag.,"Got this in a short time and in good condition. Doesn't look exactly like the picture, which looks grey and it is actually a black shiny material, but it functions well and is watertight. Fit my Pro Series 63153 rack for my Mazda3 well and straps down nicely with its own straps. We were using a large rubbermaid tote and bungee cords before this and it is a world of difference. There is more room in this thing than I will ever need, especially when you unzip the expansion zipper. Used this in a snow storm in Northern Michigan at 2 below zero and it was a little stiff but was still usable and watertight. I Would recommend this to anyone, a whole lot better than using a car TOP carrier."
5,An excellent accessory!,"We purchased this bag to use with a hitch mounted cargo carrier and it has worked wonderfully! The bag is constructed very well with heavy duty zippers, rain flaps and can be expanded up if more space is needed just like a suitcase. The mouting straps are very long and it holds securely. The cargo carrier we have has rounded edges, but if there are square edges I would recommend some sort of protection for the straps as they are a heavy duty nylon and could fray on the edges. We have driven through some heavy downpours with it and the inside of the bag was dry."
1,Sundiata,"With an intended audience range of 4 year olds to 8 years old, this book treads on dangerous territory. In a culture of violence, do we really want to introduce sorcery, curses, witches, and violence in a positive light to our pre-schoolers? I give 1 star as a token vote for the admirable illustrations."
2,Where is the CD?,"I just received my order. I understood from the reviews that the book was accompanied by a CD with audio-readings, which was one main reason I chose this particular book. However, my package contains the book only - no CD. I'm contacting Amazon to find out if this omission was by mistake. I feel i need the CD as I'm learning alone without a teacher.I can't yet comment on the book itself, as i haven't yet started studying it."
1,Understanding and using English grammar,"The two volumes are basically exercise books without enough proper explanations, examples, teaching and lessons. Pure waste of money and time."
3,A Hoosier Prospective,"I bought this book recently for something to do and being from Indiana, im always interested in high school basketball. This book jumped around and gave me infomation about the NBA and different aspects of the game that you can not began to compare to the high school game in Indiana. Yes the high school game in Indiana has changed but no where near the NBA game. I recommend this book for you are an out-of-state person wanting a good basketball book but as far as an in state person wanting to know more about the game we love in our backyard this is not it."
3,Not a deep core aerator.,This aerator is fine for dethatching and shallow plugs but don't expect to see plugs of soil laying all over your yard when you are finished.
1,Too mystical for me.,"I would never read anything by this author again. A little more reality, please."
2,hjuilk,It's alrite. I own this album at home because I use 2 love nikki. When I brought it I was so excited until after a week. It began to be a bit well boring. It's not worth buying. Some songs are good and cool but most of them don't reflect nikki as a person and her song selection is wrong. If you like music for young kids buy it because it's not like so terrible but also nikki doesn;t have a great voice although the beats are alrite
1,OMG where do I start?,In a word this album is absolutey repulsive. I don't know how this wannabe pop star got a record deal and to be frank I don't want to know. I would only recommed the purchase of this CD if you really REALLY want to torture yourself. This is so typically teeny-pop and every song sounds exactly the same. Please Nikki the world does not need a piece of hell on earth. I hope she has learnt well from her mistakes.
3,"Yuck, flash cards....","Ok, if you are interested in this product, I'll assume that you already own a Rio, so I guess I can't try to talk you out of that.GOOD - Small, easy to carry around, cheap compared to OTHER flash memory manufacturers.BAD - Expensive compared to CD-R, MD, etc.UGLY - Bad memory clusters will cause skips over time.Basically, if you have a Rio, and need more memory, this is the stuff to buy. Don't try and find Camera flash cards, and figure out how to use them in your Rio. That would not only be a nuscence, but also would end up costing you more. If you don't own a Rio, and are considering buying one, take a look at my reviews of the PMP300 and the PMP500.- E-Mail me at nairos@home.com if you have any questions -"
3,Not terrible,"While this book wasn't terrible, it wasn't great either. I think it's pretty good for a first effort though. The author possesses pretty tight plotting skills and draws great secondary characters. As far as weaknesses in the book (not counting typos), the author could do a lot more showing rather than just telling. The use of Doors songs as titles was pointless since the book didn't have the tone of a Doors song. Plus with all the pop culture references, I was disappointed that there weren't any Kids Incorporated jokes about Martika's name. As much as I liked Sarah's transformation, I got sick of reading about her Powerpuff Girls voice; I don't know why it bothered me. Also, I wish the author could have spent more time on character development. Maybe it's just me, but for once I'd like to read a chick lit book where the characters aren't obsessed with designer labels. All in all, I think Cathy Yardley has a knack for writing and I look forward to more of her works."
2,This book was horrible,"I thought this book looked interesting so I picked it up. I read the back cover and felt a similarity to the main character. Well, to my surprise, I was cringing as I was reading the first couple chapters. It was so cheesy and so predictable. The main character is a girl in her mid-twenties who meets another young lady and they become roomates. Martika, the ""cool roomate"" tries to change Sarah by making her more of a party animal. This book is ok for a high schooler, but not someone in their late twenties like me."
1,Not my thing,"A chore to read. The characters were boring, and I didn't get the feel of the exciting L.A. life like the title and blurb suggested. I think I'll re-read my old Judy Blume books, they were even more exciting than this."
3,Not right battery for my F-1,I give this battery 3 star because it fit in to my Canon F-1 but wrong voltage. The light meter is giving 2-3 stops higher than it should. The picture show 2 batteries but only one shipped. If you're wanted to use this battery for light meter on F-1 you should look for 1.3 V.
1,Wasn't Contacted,"My account had read my purchase was ""being prepared for shipment"" for a while, so I contacted seller to see what the hold up was. The book was not in inventory and the order had been cancelled, I was informed. I placed the order on Sept. 2nd and e-mailed to find out today (Sept. 19th). I was never contacted about the order being cancelled."
1,Not easy to set up and buggy software,"I am the IT manager for our company and have installed and configured all aspects of our network and computers.Even experienced as I am, I simply could not get the software to communicate with the hardware. Finally after wasting a good part of my day, I finally got it figured out.Even though the manual says to install the software on a server, our windows server 2003 system would not install the software, so I ended up having to install it on my personal system, which caused all kinds of errors and left my computer bogged down at times.It randomly loses connection to the server (which is on my system), and is quite buggy to use.If you are in the market for a payclock system, this isn't the one for you. This also applies to all the Lathem payclock systems as they all use the same software."
2,The Swimming Pool Library by Alan Hollinghurst,"I heard an interview with Alan Hollinghust on Australian radio recently and he came over as an interesting character, so I decided I would try one of his books. I understood from the what he said about himself that he is gay. However, I didn't expect this book to be so 'in-your'face' explicit. My rating for it would be 'semi-pornographic'. The review mentioned something along the lines of 'some readers may find the sex offensive', but even that did not prepare me for what was to come. In amongst all the sex is a story of sorts, which I hope might go somewhere."
2,cheap but what you pay for,"Pros:InexpensiveCons:Uncomfortable - narrow, top of heel back cuts into back of ankle, itchy zipper seam, doesn't stay 'up and smooth' on calf, looks a bit too 'club' to wear anywhere other than a Saturday night"
5,Great boots!,I am very pleased with these boots! I wear them all the time and they are very comfortable (even though they don't look like they would be.)
1,not for spanish one,I took three years of spanish in high school and can speak the language very well. I decided to also take spanish one in college and am using the Dos Mundos text. Looking over it I find that for a beginner it is very complicated. I can imagine that all the people using this text who have never spoken spanish would be completely lost. The authors have some serious explaining to do. What not start off learning spanish with the basics... not something I learned after already having a full year
3,Probably got a bad one,It only lasts a day. The original battery that came with the N80 last about 3 days. This one doesn't even look authentic and package was open.
4,the best of the next wave of american electronix,"it's not perfect, but this album represents a very fresh new idea. unknownwerks is a compilation that deserves all the attention and praise equal to big-name techno artists, and at some points overpowers the 'mainstream' electronica that people are used to thinking is 'the next big thing.' While there are obvious standouts (Metrodub's urban flavored opener and the awesome hyper Central track Hard Hit), whole whole album seems to be working together, letting the audience get a taste from every region. And for the most part, it tastes good."
2,Backscratcher,"Item was broken when received. contacted vendor, who promptly replaced it.I have only positive comments about the vendor; however, I am not impressed with the back scratcher. The pad is made out of styrofoam which is not very durable. Handle is ok, but could be stronger. Would not buy again."
3,Need more of a curve.,I have rounded shoulders from using a walker for 10 years. This doesn't have enough of a curve for me. Idea was good.
1,Arrived Broken,"Needed in time for Christmas.Opened box & found this in 2 broken pieces.Oh well, guess I'm still the back scratcher."
2,The part of the scratcher that actually does the scratching isn't long enough,"The part of the scratcher that actually does the scratching isn't long enough. That part that is 90 degrees to the handle. The current length of that part is about half an inch. It should be significantly longer, in my opinion.Roy O'Neill"
5,HAVE I GOT A BACK SCRATCHER FOR YOU!,"I am really pleased with this back scratcher, which comes with an ergonomic grip. Not only did it arrive quickly, but it came with advice about scratching! As a recent carple tunnel patient - right hand, and having arthritis in both hands, I really appreciate the length, construction and design of this product. I am able to reach everywhere on my back with ease. I recommend it very highly."
5,"Replacing ""lost"" book borrowed from Farmer","I borrowed this book from my organic farmer. It was so good, and his margin notes were so helpful that I decided that I couldn't give it back. His copy is dog eared, so when I bought him a new one, he was thrilled that he had one in better shape, and I am happy with the one I said I had lost!"
5,Clever and Smart,"I loved reading the rationale underlying the techniques. Understanding the basics made it so I could adapt my already raised beds. Replacing my old dirt with SFG soil was more costly than I liked, but worth the investment. I spread out a large tarp on our patio and mixed the proportions, transporting the finished mixture a wheel barrow at a time. It didn't take as long as I feared. Weeding was basically a non-issue until late in the growing season."
3,It's ok for little plants,This is a good basic gardening book and can make gardening easier unless you want to grow watermelons because with this method you must put vine plants running upward on a string to allow you to use the smaller space of a square foot garden. You probably could do watermelon but you would most likely need a huge wooden post to hold the vine and to tie a nylon piece to hold up the watermelon...too much work for a watermelon gardener.
4,"Great lamp, makes my home office bright as day!","The lamp is built very well. It is really, really bright on the maximum setting - it lights up my small home office as bright as day. The quality of light is really nice too - the ""Ultra Spectrum"" light looks quite similar to the light that comes out of my neodynium full spectrum bulbs, maybe with a little more blue in it, which contributes to the daylight feeling this lamp gives. I took one star off for the non-intuitive level settings (low is one bulb, medium is three, high is all four), one of the bulbs having come partially disassembled, and the cruddy packaging the lamp came in, but these are really just quibbles. It is a great lamp and is better than my expectations."
2,strange flik,Somehow i thought this film was about fresh water fishing in the great lake. It was a strange flik done by an amateur. sorry i didnt like it
5,Detailed in WW2 field strategies,"Von Manstein, the mastermind behind the early success of the III Reich in France gives a detailed description on how the front for the nazi army during the WW2 formed/developed/ended. If interested in first degree assumptions and facts from the german point of view of this field marshall of the second world war dont miss it!"
2,And he won a Grammy for this???,"I've never heard anything so inconsistant in a long time, it's all a mismatch and just does not appeal to me at all."
2,Not So Impressed,I bought this book along with another (A Happy Healthy Pet Shetland Sheepdog) and found the latter to be much more Sheltie focused with better pictures and more breed specific information.
5,Very nice hand cream,"This is the first time I've used this hand cream, and after reading the reviews I decided to try it. My skin is very dry and this cream is very good for moisturizing my hands. At first I was afraid it would be too greasy, but it isn't. It is absorbed fairly quickly and doesn't leave any signs of itself on paper or anything else. I'm using it on my arms and also massaging it into my nails and cuticles. The fragrance is nice, but very light. This is a much thicker cream than many I've used, and can be used on legs and knees as well. I'm very pleased with this product, and I think I need another tube for upstairs, too. This one is in the kitchen. I wish I'd discovered it sooner."
4,Great Teaching Resource!,"Great product! As an aspiring teacher, I will definetely use this book to teach science when I am in my own classroom!"
4,Great Indie Film,My wife and I are always on the lookout for up and coming directors. Looks like Dave Reda is on his way to becoming a great director. This movie has an original story line and not like the cookie cutter crap that all the other indie film makers are putting out. Not only is the have a great horror value but there is a few great one liners thrown in will have you laughing out loud. Definitly worth checking this one out and I love how it came out in the super 16 film. This movie is very good and i'd love to see another film by this director on a mega film studio budget. Good luck on your future Dave. Loved the movie.
5,near ideal ipad stand,"I am not going to be stingy with the stars because this item is so close to perfect, and of course because it's not designed to be an ultraportable ipad stand, it merely happens to be one.I have but one design complaint relevant only to my specific use; the lip the ipad sits on is unnecessarily long and the stand could pack flatter if it were shorter, or perhaps hinged.Also, be aware of the high shipping cost. I wish Amazon fulfilled them, individually, so a single unit purchase might qualify for free shipping. As it is now, this two unit purchase is a good value.Note this company makes an ipad stand, but it is more complicated. It adds the feature of an extra bail to allow it to hang from an edge, such as an upright airline tray table. Like every other ipad stand on the market, it seems overengineered when compared to this simple two wire display stand."
5,Amazing,I really liked 8 with its few warts. So far version 9 has no warts at all and I was surprised at its accuracy given the incredibly fast initial training. Works well with the TV or radio running in the background if you read and follow the instructions.
2,An Average film,"This movie was pretty much average in every department. The story , the acting, and the fighting. But the only bad thing is the horrible picture quality. I mean this version is worst than VHS tape, its so blurry. The only reason to buy this movie on DVD is to get the chapter selection so you can go to any fight scene in the movie , and to add it to your Wu Tang DVD Collection. I would have given this movie a higher rating if the picture was better."
1,Wrong Item,"Sir,The item send to me is a downgraded one which is not worth the amount of the sale value of the book. It cost only $2.95 against $8.99 and the mailing is only $0.51 as compared to $3.95 asked. I went to Barnes and Nobles and bought a different one much better that what I received for a lesser also.I can't recommend this merchant to anyone because I don't want to be blamed later. I emailed him yesterday but he just ignored it.Thank you.Sergio Y. Tablico"
3,Great product but great pricing,Loved it! Worked quickly. It still stinks but not as bad as others I've tried. I think shipping cost should be lowered because once you add on shipping cost the product is higher than local store price. Not a great deal if your trying not to waste money!
4,Very cute charm,"I loved this charm, however I thought it would be a real round bottle and it is only on the front. Also was going to use it on a tiffany like charm bracelette and the clasp does not fit around the metal ring of my bracelette so I have to get a small gold ring to attach it. The diamonds are very nice and overall I am pleased and feel that the price is good for the item."
4,An Excellent Read!,"This was a really stunning and thrilling book. A brutal murder in Tokyo is linked to a homicide detective. It appears to have been a warning to the doctor who is about to perform delicate surgery on Nicholas Linnear's brain... the detective turns out, as the story unfolds, to be Linnear's greatest nemesis, an amoral master of martial arts who aims to wield unspeakable power... a must-read!"
1,Beware! This Is a Ripoff!,"I was in San Diego several years back and happened into a downtown video store. I was pleased to find a VHS copy of ""Sailor"" and couldn't wait to get home so I could watch Kris and Sarah make hot sexy love all over the place. But what I got instead was a G-rated movie suitable for the kids, Grandma, Fido, etc. All the Good Parts of this movie have been deleted...without any sort of ""altered version"" designation on the package!Honestly, I wasn't aware that movies were sanitized for home-video release; I thought it was the other way around (i.e. really racy, scandalous stuff unsuitable for theatrical viewing was included on the video). So, what is the name of the genius who deleted this footage, and when will a *complete* version be available?"
5,Good book to start with.,Having used WebDB from version 2.0 I found this book to be very instructive and quite useful in filling in the gaps in my knowledge of WebDB. I would definitely recommend it to anyone starting to use WebDB. I also found the web site good and found that the author was quite helpful when I had a question. This is a very good effort for the first book on the subject.
4,Not as good as promised by other reviewers,"After reading all the excellent reviews and reacting enthusiastically to a one-minute download of the track India with its enchanting flute solo, actually listening to this record was somewhat of a disappointment. However, knowing that some jazz music gains only after listing more than a few times, I will give it a few more honest tries. The highly promoted A Love Supreme interpretation I found particularly disappointing. Nothing beats the original here. I expected too much. But at least I got a good chance to discover David Murray."
2,Disapointed,It was advertised as a medium weight uniform but it is a cheap light weight and had I known this I would not have bought it.
5,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH I......WELL I JUST LOVE IT!,"The title says it all. I got this game because I had heard very good things about it. Once I got it, I thought it would be easy to beat, BUT IT'S NOT! I still havent won it after about two months. From my experience, I can tell that this will be a good game to play again after I've won."
2,IT'S NOT A POOR GAME,"I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUY GAMES THAT ARE PUBLISHED BY NATSUME, BUT THIS GAME IS SO DISSAPOINTING FOR ME. THIS GAME IS SO INTERESTING AT FIRST BUT IT BECAME BORING AND STUPID LATER ON.WHAT KIND OF STUPID GAME IS THIS? THIS IS THE MOST STUPID GAME AMONG ALL THE OTHER HARVEST MOON SERIES.""HARVEST MOON BACK TO NATURE"" WAS GOOD BUT NOT THIS ONE. I'LL TELL YOU WHY THIS GAME IS SO STUPID.BUYING SEEDS,WATERING CROPS,TAKING CARE OF THOSE SILLY ANIMALS REALLY BORES ME.THE TOWN IS SMALL.YOU CANNOT WALK AROUND.I GAVE THIS GAME 2 STARS BECAUSE IT IS PUBLISHED BY NATSUME. THEREFORE, I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BUY THIS STUPID GAME"
4,Home On The Range,"This is a cool game! I play it all the time! It's a basic game of hard work. Here's my schedule: 1.Wake up 2.Take dog out 3.Get water can from shed 4.Water plants or harvest plants 5.Plant new plants if there was a harvest 6.Go to shed to get brush and milker 7.Feed cows 8.Talk to cows 9.Milk cows and make it into butter or cheese 10.Take each cow on a walk 11.Go to chicken coop 12.Put eggs in shipping bin 13.Feed chickens 14.Go get the sickle from the shed 15.Cut ripe grass if any 16.Go to underground caves 17.Feed Harvest Sprites mushrooms 18.Take a dip in the hot springs 19.Go to town to buy new things 20.Ride horse 21. Go to the drink shop when it gets dark 22.Take dog in 23.Go to bed If you want to buy this game but you are not sure about the details and you want to know more, e-mail me at Twister1530@excite.com and I'll send you a complete walkthrough."
5,A good game!,"Harvest Moon lets you start your own life,responsibility,and raise your own crops and animals. There are hard times, yet there are many festivals and things to explore. Harvest Moon and Havest Moon 64 are possibly the best games U can buy. If you like helping things grow as opposed to killing them, that is."
4,A outstanding game but not quite up to the SNES standard.,This game is loads of fun and allows for hours of enjoyment of creative thinking and budgeting to be succesful. First things first this game I wouldn't reccomend for littler children because it can be frusterating when you make mistakes that can't be fixed. I liked how you could keep playing after two years but you can't pick up a bride or have a baby in this game which was one of the fondest memories I have of the SNES game and you can't explore the moutains either because they were taken out. You can however still breed cows and chickens but not as much. Another good point of this game is that it is game link compatible which allows you to trade seeds and livestock with friends. This is a great buy for someone who is not easily frusterated but you may want to opt for the new N64 version(I have not played this yet) or the SNES one.
3,Not a light-hearted romance,"I have to say Roberta is probably the bravest heroine I have ever read about. She's suffered a lot in her life ever since childhood. Her mother, sister, ex-husband were all terrible to her, yet she preserved her optimistic and independent spirit and somehow made life wonderful for her children in Camden. Although I admire her greatly, it really is hard to believe that such a person is possible. Gabe, on the other hand, is so real. He is not the dazzling alpha male often seen in some romance novels, yet he is everything a woman would want for a husband.I agree with some reviewers that the violent scene was a bit too much, I almost stopped reading there, but I kept wanting to know how she would pull herself and her family through this. In the end she did, but I felt unsatisfied - the evil of the town's people including her mother, sister, brother-in-law was too much and justice was not served. The ending might be the reality in 1916, but it left a lot to be wanted."
1,Strategy & Techniques? No. Pie in the sky? Yes,"The review promises ""behind the scenes & off-the-record strategies of today's top direct marketers."" This book was woefully short on strategy or technique. I would say almost non-existent but there were a few copies of ads that work.The book was largely selling the benefits of Long Sales copy. If you don't know if Direct Marketing is a good idea for you are your business and aren't interested in the specifics it's a great book. If you already believe in Direct Marketing and are looking for a how-to this is not it. It is a promotional vehicle for the authors to push there consulting service for their specific industry. Save yourself $10 and just go register at [...]A book I found much better on the brass tacks of writing sales copy was Maria Veloso,Web Copy That Sells: The Revolutionary Formula for Creating Killer Copy That Grabs Their Attention and Compels Them to Buy"
2,"Unreliable, short-term fix","When the micro touch hair trimmer works, it works well; however, half the time it doesn't goon until you've played aorund with it for twenty minutes, and now it doesn't go on all. While I'll try another one, this is the last time."
3,It's OK,"I've had mine now for almost 3 years and it is still working fine. However, be careful if you use the attachments as they have a tendency to fall off. And, if you use it without the attachment, it will irritate your skin and even nick you. Works best for small areas and is very good for touching up your neck. It also works well for more personal areas as long as you heed the warning above."
2,Microtouch Trimmer,"It lasted one year and two weeks, then the motor died. While it worked it was great. I am tempted to buy a replacement, but will probably end up trying another brand. The manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several, because when they do work they do a great job."
3,Good- but there are better Gershwin Tributes Around,"I was attracted to listen to this CD because I am a fan of the music of George Gershwin. While this effort is good, as another reviewer suggested there is better Gershwin material out there. For example, Susannah McCorkle's tribute CD is vastly superior.Still, it is pleasant material although it could have been better by a better selection of material."
4,GL- A Great Second Album.,"I have to agree that George Lamond definitely beat the sophomore jinx. This album is definitely a great improvement from his first album. The arrangements are well put together. I loved this album. Hopefully George will put out a Third Salsa Album and make us all happy. I would love to see George and Sergio George hook up for a whole album. I think that combo would put George on another level considering what Sergio did for Marc Anthony, La India & DLG to name a few."
3,100 years of football,"I found the video quite interesting. Even though I expected a different approach (a more historical one), many of the images and the top tens have brought back memories of extraordianry moments of this great sport. The narration in spanish could have been a little less euphoric, but it was OK. In summary, a very good product for the FIFA lovers."
2,Stick with the older Bennet,"A young Tony Bennett just doesn't,t have it yet. A mature Bennett has great phrasing and a raspy, sexy quality to his voice. Eighty plus years has been extremely kind to him!"
5,Tony Bennett Fans - Enjoy!,"I purchased this CD to hear one song that I fell in love with after hearing it on NPR Radio. ""The Very Thought of You"" is a beautiful song along with so many other standards that Tony Bennett is known for. I heard him one time in the Fox Theatre in St. Louis, MO. A beautiful venue where you could hear him sing without benefit of a microphone. I grew up listening to Tony Bennett along with Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, etc. and continue to thoroughly enjoy their music."
4,Nice collection takes you back to the days of the phonograph,Bennett is truly one of the great voices of the time. This collection is very complete. Keep in mind they are older recordings so it may sound like you are listening through your grandparents victrola.
4,Needed external storage,"I have 2 of these and have used them for a least 2 years and they work just fine. However, they require an electrical supply that must be plugged into the wall. Not too long ago, I bought a much larger Seagate external hard drive from Amazon and it's much smaller but with 5 times the storage, PLUS, it is powered via a USB connection, so everything is much neater beside my work station. If you need just a 160GB external hard drive, the Trexstor is just fine, and inexpensive, but you still have to contend with having to plug the power supply into wall outlet."
3,"Cello? Yes. Romantic? -Erm, No.","This is not the Barry White collection of Cello music to play for your girlfriend when she comes over. You will not be saying ""Yeah, Baby!"" to this mix.Kind of funny that classical music types brand themselves as such brainy folks, it's a laugh this disc is such an off-the-mark mixed bag. -Is this the best they could do? -Or is this ""Romantic"" to a classical music person?Good music, well performed, but Not Romantic -at -all."
1,Used wood cornice,"I bought a Burnes of BostonLL2965 Level Line 36"" Walnut Cambridge Ledge but the product arrived broken and it was painted by hand. It was already used NOT a new item. The money was returned but the time and the dissapoinment was there. For this product check Sears, Jc pennys the have alot of those for 50% off."
3,Isn't For Everyone,"I really wonder how so many artists have lost some of their luster after time. Nevertheless, the music maybe why, but with other artists, they also may be why as well. Lionel Richie has come in and out in the industry. He has truly wrote some great tracks, but this is mixed in itself. With Just For You, his title track to his 2004 record, isn't all that exciting for most of the listeners out there, but die hard listeners will enjoy this pop ballad Lionel conjured up. All in all, I really didn't find anything exciting from this, that would make me buy Just For You, but the song does grow on you time after time. Listen, then decide for yourself."

1,What the?,This book is a literary work of art and its depth conveys a sense of accomplishment from its gifted author.Had ya there didnt I!!?Isla Fisher is an attention seeking second rate actress who will sell her soul to the devil for fourteen and a half minutes of fame.This book is not worth the paper it's printed on.
5,"Great wisdom, easy read, straight to the point","I read this book in about 2 hours, almost in one sitting. The author writes brief conveys his message in brief, concise statements which sends the message across. The book is a collection of attributes that one must have to rise to the top of an organization. It briefly mentions each point and tells you a reason why you have to do so.A couple of key points surprised me, like the ""Skip all office parties"" rule and the ""Eat in your hotel room"" one. Take the advice given here with a grain of salt. It's really easy reading, but by no means gives a sufficient explanation why you should really follow each rule. It's a must read for employees, even if you don't plan on becoming CEO."
3,"Lots of good tips, but not much substance","""How to Become CEO"" is a book with 75 tips that will help you to develop the skills to take on the CEO position. Other than the tips, the book doesn't offer much more in term of substance.Many of the tips border on the obvious. ""Never write a nasty memo"", ""Don't expect someone else to plan your career"" and ""Treat as people as special"" fall under this category. A few tip are insightful such as ""Keep a people file"", ""Think for 1 hour every day"" and ""Go to the library for 1 day every month"".While all of the tips are useful and wise, hardly any of them are unique. And to make matters worse, there is very little substance regarding how to implement each of the tips into your life.Pick this book up if you want, but I would recommend ""Million Dollar Habits"" by Brian Tracy instead. 3 out of 5 stars."
4,I dont know if I will be CEO but.....,"I enjoyed reading the book and found it helpful in some respects. There are some hints of what not to do that I thought were very insightful, primarily because most employees of a company do the very things he says not to do. I do not know how far you are really going to get to being CEO w/o a high level of education and experience and political savvy, but this book tends to be more of a ""attitude"" and ""methods"" adjustment handbook in my opinion. However, it is definitly one for the library."
4,Just like his other books...,"This reads and looks just like his other books. I wouldn't classify this as rules for the CEO as much as they are rules for being a leader in business. But, I guess how to become CEO has a better ring to it?With that being said, I found this an enjoyable read and from time to time re-read this book. It always rings true."
4,Educational in climbing into the role of a Corp. CEO.,These are important trueisms in decision making processes as you climb your way up the corporate ladder. This book is easy to read and many of the chapters really make you turn your focus to its validity. After your first read through I guarantee you will read it again. I would like to thank Mr. Fox for the educational lesson.
2,Read it standing at a check out,"Simple and written in command format, this book could easily be distilled into a few useful points for anyone's individual taste. The book focuses on creating work habits and work culture avoidance. The author has some unusual advice, like ""never go to an office party."" There are interesting points, several are creative, but the author does not present evidence that these commands are followed by CEO's of major corporations. This book is essentially a lengthy magazine article of tips and hints."
3,The German soldier from the 1700s to 1945.,"I actually enjoyed this read, although it is a bit dated. The author characterizes (and stereotypes) the Germna soldier. Perhaps some of this could be true, some is obviously not. As for the Germna soldier not participating in some of the massacres of WWII, this is not true. Some German soldiers did participate in the murder of civilians, so the distinction between Germans and Nazis is not so clear.I think the author does a good job of detailing the history of the Prussian and German soldier. He gives a good history of both the rise and fall of the German soldier. I think he gives a good example of the Molte, Claudiwitz, Frederick the Great, and others. It also shows how the Germans were taught the endurance of a Prussian for hardships.This is an OK although dated read."
5,"Good, Quality 9 Volt Holder",I recently converted a Pachinko machine to run on a battery and this battery holder was very useful. It's well made and can be easily mounted.
1,Good Deal but bad product,Deal is good b'coz in $20 u get battry of worth $35 with camara case however Quality of case is pathetic.. its bad.....
2,universal life energy,Translated from original language . Dull reading . Not much practical information in this book for those interested in reiki .
2,Nicely Neutral Or Pretty Vacant?,"A sweet and nice book, but still feels a little ""vacant"" and empty to me. It contains references to eventual emotional and mental symptoms behind the causes for illnesses that can be a worth while reading if you are interested in such things."
5,100% purely delightful.,"This was my first SARK book, but not my last. I have everything she's done, be it books, cards, calendars. She is as insightful and delightful in person as are the works she creates. Treat yourself. Bet you can't do just one!"
3,Not for pine needles!,"I bought the Hoover SpinSweep after reading favorable reviews. In some respects (especially the motorless feature), the machine is very attractive; however,I find it useless in dealing with the pine needles that litter our driveway. The needles clog the brushes and must be cleared out by hand every few minutes. In addition, the SpinSweep is clumsy in cornering and cumbersome to turn on a narrow walkway. Although it is relatively lightweight, it is bulky and, consequently, takes up a fair amount of storage space. I will say it is efficient in picking up leaves and will clear most grass cuttings from a concrete surface. I did not try picking up large items such as toys, empty cans, etc."
3,Uk Garage as we know it,"This compilation brings us the newest and most diverse uk garage since Wookie. Where all the other garage albums are mostly picks from the newest 12"" and are mixed together by a big name. This one is from head to toe different. No similar sounding tracks and no remixes from corny RnBsongs. There is one thing i have to get warn you for, if you dont like 1 song from the solid crew, you probably wont like them all. 2stepping"
4,"Very good for turning products, just a little smaller than what I needed though.","I have used this to turn several bowls, but the first project that I made was just 1/2 an inch too large for the chuck to fit inside the bowl. I use it with my PSI chuck. Now that I know the limitations, I just adjust the piece accordingly."
3,Hoover Flair Bagless Hot Stick S2200,"I am rating this product three stars because it over heats quick .. Does not pick up from carpet , I have had trouble with this .. Well for the price it's not all that bad ."
3,Not terrible so far..,"This vacuum does not stand upright on it's own - you need to pay the extra $15 for the red model for that feature. I've used it a few times now, and besides it getting pretty hot pretty fast, it picks up EVERYTHING. Pieces of chipping base board, hair, dust, even a rubber band (oops).So far so good. I'll post an update if I run into problems. My one piece of advice - as much as I love Amazon, buy this at a store so you can return it if necessary. It will cost you the price of the vacuum to ship it back."
3,Awesome vacuum- BUT!!!,"I have had several different brands of small stick vacuums, both corded and cordless, and my personal opinion is that the corded Hoover Flair is the best. It has strong suction power & an easy to clean filter, which is perfect if you have kids and pets. The swivel head makes it easy to get into those hard to reach places. Now with that said, the down side to this vacuum is that the neck housing, where the vacuum connects to the power nozzle, breaks easily if dropped on a hard surface. I have (2) of the Hoover stick vacs and both have broken neck housing, which I'm in the process of ordering replacement parts for. When they are replaced, I'm going to reinforce the neck housing myself, with several wraps of DUCK-TAPE and see it that helps : ), because I do LOVE the power of this little vacuum, I just don't like the thin neck housing.PS: I've had mine since they first came out and have heard that they improved the neck housing problem. (I hope)"
1,Flair is not so Fair,"One thing I must say is this s2200 is very low on suction and I was very disappointed. The easy disconnect of the dirt cannister is a plus, but just doesn't make it as a very good dirt picker-upper. Please make your decision to buy a different model, this doesn't work very well."
4,Nice and Light Vac,"The Hoover Flair vacuum is nice and light for easy use. The suction is good, and it isn't too loud. The only thing I miss is a hose that my last vac had."
2,Unhappy Consumer,"First, this is not really a lightweight vacuum. I haven't had it a year yet, and couldn't use it for a few months because the filtercup part wouldn't close tightly.It doesn't do as good a job on hard surfaces as my Bissell 3-in-1 stick vac that I bought for $19. Does a very poor job on carpets. Overall, I feel that my money was wasted on this product."
1,It doesn't suck,"Strong suction is not this machine's strong point. It will not suck up a grain of rice (long-grain, white, uncooked), unless one pulls the head off and uses the tube end (which is quite easy to do, and one can do edges that way too). That being said, it does a fair job with the smaller stuff, and the dust cup (or dog hair cup in my case) is amazingly full when one finishes. The cord is long enough for my purposes, and the aforementioned dust cup is handy - beats buying bags, though I imagine the filter at its top will need to be replaced at some point. I wonder if there's a stick vac that actually has good suction . . .Addendum May 2012: We got rid of this thing, since we found we never used it, since it didn't really work very well. I still don't know of a stick-type vac for hard floors that works well - we use a broom, and a regular vac for the edges and sucking up what we swept into a pile."
2,Defective product twice,"I had researched ""Consumer Reports"" and found this to be their top rated product for this catergory. Initially I was very impressed with the suction and ability to maneuver this vacuum. However, after the first use of the vacuum, the switch that changes it from ""carpet"" setting to ""floor"" setting broke, and the brushes could no longer function to clean the floors adequately. Amazon was wonderful to exchange my defective vacuum, but the second one had the exact same problem! I've given up and will purchase a more expensive but hopefully more durable floor vacuum. I gave it 2 stars because before this problem, I really enjoyed the vacuum."
2,Hoover Flair Bagless,The unit tends to overheat even after a few minutes of being on . We also use it on a hallway throw rug and it doesn't like picking up - it tends to ball up the dust & harr which remains on the rug. the cup seams to be small.
2,Not crazy about it,"I've owned many Hoover products and have always loved them. I had the previous model of the Hoover stick vac for years and loved it. When it finally bit the dust I naturally replaced it with the updated model. Now I realize they don't make things like they used to, but the quality of this one is quite inferior to the previous design. It doesn't have as much power and is more unwieldy. A few pieces also broke off within the first year. I expected better from Hoover."
1,Waste!,"Hello...is this thing on? Does not pick up a thing! Light, compact just as it states but that's about it! Pass!!!!"
2,not a good quality Hoover,"I purchased this in 9/09, and now it has been 8 months later and the vacuum sometimes does not start and the plastic cover is very difficult to put on and off to remove the dirt cup. The clip gets stuck and it takes a lot of patience to play around with it to remove. Also one of the front wheels keeps falling off. When this was working properly, it was only good on bare floors, definitely not for carpets! I would not recommend this vacuum. Hoover used to make such good products in the past."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a waste.It OVERHEATS if it stays on more than 5 minutes. Then, to cool down, it has to be dis onnected for 20 minutesa. This is not a sporadic problem--THIS OVERHEATS ALL THE TIME.The cord clips (the things you wrap the cord with) don't stay in place so the cord falls always falls off the appliance. Bad design.The nozzled/flood sweeaper do not stay together.This is a cheap, plastic, poorley-designed applicance in my opinion. Save our money and figure out an alterhative.Am so disappointed, have wasted so much time on this product."
3,hoover flair S2200,"Love the vacuum, but at 10 months it started falling apart. A screw, that I had never touched, became stripped and would not stay in. Also the wheels fell off. When I called the company, they said that only the ""motor"" was guarateed for 1 year. Funny thing, the paperwork that came with the vacuum doesn't mention anything other than guaranteed for 1 year. It doesn't specify things that are guaranteed or not guaranteed. They said I had to replace the entire head for $22.00. Just for the wheels???? I bought a 4 inch screw, and a locking washer. Fixed it myself for under $1.00."
4,Still love it after 6 months!,"I bought this for picking up kid's crumbs under the kitchen table and dust balls on the hardwoods (that seem to magically appear every 3 days). I am still loving it! It gets the Cheerios, small pieces of crafts, stray Legos as well as the dustbunnies. Even glitter! I would recommend this to anyone with noncarpeted floors (tile, hardwood, linol). I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it stinks on rugs and carpet. So I still have to lug the old vacuum out for the throw rugs. But I mostly use it for my kitchen tile and hardwoods. The filter is easy to clean, too. Very light, can use on stairs, too. I am buying one for my Mom today."
1,Quick Repair becoming a pain,"I""m running into a problem where the swivel collar & head assembly keeps coming apart. I was able to push the parts back together each time. Kind of a pain but as long as it pops back and you're careful pushing it around it will stay assembled.Update: Head assembly coming off all the time. The connection point has worn from pushing it back on.Not a good design."
2,"Some pluses, some minuses","People who want to learn to master the Nintendo controller (I always preferred using a joystick) will find it easy to learn on this game. No constant attacks from opponents (no shoot-'em-up action) make it possible to concentrate. On the other hand, this game has the most boring peripheral characters and dialogue ever seen. The best part of it is learning to allocate time and resources when raising crops and animals, which may be valuable for younger players. The rating mistakenly (I think) pegs use of alcohol as the possible offensive factor, but frequent mention of Goddess worship (it's an import, remember) and the silly chase-her-until-you-win-her stuff may upset more folks. I bought it, but I wish I'd rented it."
1,Only one of the most crappiest games ever!,"I hate this game. Basically you're a farmer who farms things. I will try to be fair and include pros and cons.PROS:1. uhhhh...CONS:1. Where do I start?! First, your day ALWAYS starts out the same way. You water your plants, feed your animals, and then wander around. I don't know about you, but that's pretty boring to me.2. There's a bar in the game. That tells a little kid: ""It's fun to drink beer!""3. Who likes a farming game?4. This game is WAY too addicting!I think I've made my point: don't buy this game."
4,Great RPG / Sim !,"This is an awesome game with marvelous graphics, superb comtrols, and best of all, fun game play. I don't know whether to consider this an RPG or a sim, because it combines elements of both, but lacks a battle mode and isn't linear, so it can really be considered a ""Life Sim"". This game is great fun for all ages and becomes very addictive once you get the farm running. The only reason I didn't give this game a perfect 5 is the translation. The Japanese to English translation was done very poorly and grammatical errors are found throughout the game. For example, on the opening screen, instead of ""Push Start"" it says ""Push the Start"". This is only one of many mistakes. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, and the bad English and the fact that some parts can get a little dragged out are really its only weaknesses. Final word: Buy this game."
4,HARVEST MOON 64 ROCKS,"I think that HArvest Moon64 is the best game out there! It is my favorite game, and I really want to play it again! but I have lost it so I am saving up to get my own from here, but my dad says he is not buying from the internet, cuz, they usually rip you off, I just think HE WANTS EVERYTHING HIS WAY! BUT I WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET HARVEST MOON BACK< NOTHING< NOTHIN NOTHING!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOTTA THING, HAHAHAHAGAG"
3,Fun game but a waste of money,"Harvest Moon is a very fun game...until you get into it. I personally was enjoying the game and the challenge of rebuilding the farm and making a love connection. Then the game suddenly ended. The young boy's father comes to visit and the game is over. I adored playing the game and wanted to continue, not to abrubtly end. This game is fun but not worth the money. Borrow it or rent it...you'll be much better off."
1,Major GPS issues with this unit!,"If you are looking at this unit for GPS and can only use a single din unit, pick a portable unit you will be much happier. This unit will not work without an electronic speed indicator from the car or motorcycle your installing this unit in. If you can not supply this lead the unit will not work. You can buy a speed indicator that fools the unit into thinking this lead is attached, but the GPS is not accurate, and this unit will cost another $200.00. Radio fair not great, but no auto station ID, and song information,this should be standard. DVD player ok, but can you really watch a DVD on that small a screen and drive? When will a vendor understand that iPhones are now as much a part of life as the iPod and let them work on these unit also. Bluetooth cell phone interface is ok but also not ready for prime time."
4,A romance novel in disguise,I purchased this book thinking it was about family tragedy. It is and it isn't. It's really a novel about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man and the obstacles they face. It's a good read and I highly recommend it.
5,Excellent,"John Steven's debut album shows how completely underrated his voice has been. He made a relaxing album of standards and modern songs, and made them all unique. The best tracks off the album are My Blue Heaven, Here, there and everywhere, this love, all of me, Don't Get around much Anymore. Highly recommended."
2,Talented yes,I think he is talented. Yet I find his songs boring. No flare or razzle dazzle as was heard from the era he is trying to mimic. Be yourself and be unique. Come Fly with me is a song Frank would have had fun with. Someone to watch over me. Frankly it put me to sleep. Try again John. You can do better.
4,A great escape,"I caught on to John Stevens while watching him on American Idol. Even though I thought he was out of place in that competition, I figured he had a future with that genre of music. I was pleased to find his album when I did a search on Amazon. I like the album but wish he would adopt more of a Dean Martin or Perry Como style instead of the Frank Sinatra style he favors. Still, I rate this as a good purchase."
2,Great music -- weak vocals,"I'd like to set something straight. John Stevens couldn't sing on American Idol and he can't sing now. I think the only reason he even got a recording contract is that he sings ""Sinatra-type"" songs. You would think that he is the only young guy singing this type of music. Luckily, he is not.John Stevens still has an extremely thin voice, sings out of tune (although some of this has been fixed in studio) and sings with absolutely no passion or feeling. He still sounds like the scared, young understudy that he honestly should be. Perhaps this adds a little bit of innocence to the sound of this disc, but I would prefer to hear a stronger singer.The only reason I gave this CD two stars is that I enjoy the music and I am surprisingly listening to this CD a lot. Unfortunately, the suave arrangements can't save the weakness of the vocals.If you want to hear a young guy who can sing and sings the same style songs, check out Michael Buble. Now that guy can really sing!"
4,Excellent summary of the upcoming 2000 problem.,"Very well researched. The first part of the book is an excellent source for people who want some quick info. The second part, however,is too speculative; the author talks about the chance of a world government taking over after the Y2K bug strikes and he doesn't give enough evidence to support his point. Overall, still a nice small book that EVERYBODY should read in order to know how to prepare before it's too late... It can be read in one 3 hour sitting."
1,Its a flight Sim that frustrating,This is a game that very frusrating becouse of the play controls. You have to control every thing from the landing gear to the back rudders. This game is like flying a real plane so if your looking for fast action than this game wouldnt be for you. I rented it and sucked.
1,Don't even think of buying or renting this game.,Don't waste your time playing this game. Although it has a high detailed terrain but the game is too boring.
1,Molly's Folly!,"How did the author blow up three not so complex subjects up into a book while intending to make a ton of money of idiots like you and me? She added a bunch of verbage and LOTS of pretty pictures...This book left me DAZED, CONFUSED and DISMAYED. Dazed because I suffered through 600 pages of verbage. Confused because I dolled out $39.99 for a book I though would help me. And dismayed because I don't understand how such a crappy book ever made it to print!"
3,"fits well, but...","This really fits the streamlight very well. Flips up easily. 5 stars for fit and finish, but this got 3 stars because basically it cuts the power of the beam down to almost nothing. Without the cap the beam shines as well as a good Q beam out to 200 yards or further, with this cap the visibility is only about 50-60 yards."
5,Item is OK. But I have not got it yet. I paid it one month ago.,"In this moment I live in Spain, European Union. I have bought these MARVELLOUS DVDs from other sellers. I got them in a week more or less. In this occasion, it is a month since I paid them. I expect to get them as soon as possible. They contain the last images of Audrey Hepburn."
3,a mere re-write of Josephus,"Far more has been discovered lately by archaeologists, like Bowersock and Millar, about the startling real-life model of Herod Philip, for instance, the questionable 3rd son of Herod The Great, as the source for the fictional Jesus Christ.It is not nearly enough to semi-exonerate the Messiah Herod - who fulfilled Old Jewish Testament prophecies of re-building Solomon's Temple and re-uniting King David's Israel and Judah - as a genius of architecture and politics. Josephus is hopelessly contradictory, and probably deliberately so, to make of the King of the Jews & Arabs a bad guy, to make Greek Jews like Paul look good. No. Richardson may make an attempt to be more sympathetic, which is a good start, but there's 2 thousand years of christian lies to make up for, and there needs to be a lot more admittance of the coins and archaeology and ancient texts that strongly indicate Herod was a Roman and a Caesar at that."
3,"Good on price, bad on photo quality, noise, power thirsty","Pros: good price, fast mono printing, O.K. color graphic.Cons: _ cheapo design_ limited memory, unupgradeable (unexpandable)_ do not support any kind of print server (I am really frustrated @ this problem)_ noisy, It keeps screaming until you put it in standby mode. When printing, it sounds like a dryer machine is running._ power thirsty_ bad on photo quality (I don't understand why someone said this one gives out a good photo quality. My photo was printed out with terrible white background, and picture is dotty)I just don't want to be so mean to Konica, so I gives it 3 stars due to it good price. Otherwise, I don't recommend this printer. I recommend Dell 3100cn"
2,A collection of facts,"This is essentially a collection of interesting & curious facts about humans' & other animals' survival under extreme environmental conditions. I didn't get much out of it, probably because I was expecting something more substantial. Some of the explanations offered seemed questionable, or at least were not backed up by references to the literature. Then again, this isn't that kind of a book."
2,"Buildup fails, instead it's boring","I think the main storyline failure is that chapter after chapter consists of the two characters arguing. This is supposed to function as the buildup of sexual tension, but it doesn't work. It gets really boring really fast.In general, the plot and characters seemed contrived."
2,Doesn't work with all portable dvd players,"There is not enough information to describe the right operation of this item before your purchase. Keep in mind the next info before ordering:This tv tuner's DC in (5v) has to be connected to DC out (5v) of the DVD player with a cable (included); Many portable DVD players (including mine)DON'T have this option; otherway you can connect the tv tuner to an AC adapter (5v) **NOT INCLUDED**After the tv turner is plugged in the portable dvd player you MUST SELECT ""AUX"" by pressing the *source** buttom on the portable dvd player -many don't have the option-To me and my portable dvd player, this item is useless.The reason I rated this item with two stars is due to the fast delivery from the seller."
1,"This is a NTSC ""analog"" tv tuner (the FCC to shut down their analog transmitters in 2009.) This is worthless.","Need RMA to return this is a NTSC ""analog"" TV tuner (the FCC to shut down their analog transmitters in 2009.). The Specifications & Description needs to be updated. It is printed on the back ""TV System: NTSC"" This is worthless.."
3,nice & quick but...,"It was very quick till send my item but the DVD case was broken (lucky enough, the DVD itself was safe).otherwise, it was all right.I might buying something from them if I have a next chance."
2,just not very good.,"freinds of mine told me to check this band out, each with glowing and positive things to say. although plenty of people out there seem to enjoy o.a.r., to me this is a bland, forgettable album. they aren't great musicians, the singer is irritating, but the most glaring problem with the group is that they write boring songs that you swear have been written before (guster, rustic overtones, dispatch, and dave matthews band have covered this territory time and time again, and they are all much more rewarding and enjoyable than o.a.r.) there's nothing wrong with music that isn't completley original, but these guys just aren't getting any better with time. i hear they're good live, but they'll never be more than a college concert draw if they don't start making more interesting music than this."
4,Practical approaches,"My recommendation is based upon the book's content, not collectability value. I have been painting for over thirty years and find the information, techniques and insites in this book very helpful for the figure painter. I often go back to my reference books to rekindle my interest in various techniques and I use Schmid's book when I want to return to oil techniques for figure work. Unfortunatly, most of the good texts on figure work in oil are out of print (like Schmid's). Based on the book's usefulness, I recommend it to any figure artist."
4,Helpful!,"This book was easy to follow and provided more practical information which I used throughout my pregnancy. I purchased other books for reference, but I read this one from cover to cover. I found the information was very helpful, especially for a first pregnancy. Buy and enjoy."
3,Nancy Drew: The Secret of the Scarlet Hand,"This game was good, but I've played all of the Nancy Drew games so far, and it wasn't my favorite. However, this game was full of interesting facts about the Mayan culture and history, and I did enjoy it. It was also challenging, which I liked, and it was also addictive and hard to stop playing. In my opinion, this game was the most informative. All in all, this game was fun and enjoyable, if not my favorite."
2,Not the best Nancy Drew Game,"I've played nearly every Nancy Drew Game. This one was hard, and wasn't that interesting. The ""research"" you need to do is boring, and tedious. I never even finished the game, as it was so boring."
3,Bay Area Funk!,"If you're from the Bay, then you can appreciate and respect the artistic expression of the Whoridas, although if you are from some other part of the country, the Whoridas might have to grow on you... But, believe me King Sann and Mr. Taylor have the infectious lyrics and funky beats to do just that!"
2,Cameta Camara Nikon D200 Battery Grip kit,Picture in image shows genuine Nikon Li-on battery. Kit arrives with 2 generic CTA Digital batteries.
3,Children Beware!,"Oy vay! When I first saw the preview for this movie I thought it looked cool and kinda' was a spoof of Star Wars Ep.1, but ,golly, so many naked people kinda goes past the PG rating,eh? Well, the plot was ok, and the chicks(yes naked) were not that bad. BUT! when the evil man shed all...........you can kinda' guess my reaction."
5,Few books change your life and how you view things.,"Holistic Christianity by Conti changed my life, my faith and how I look at mysticism. And the beauty of this book is how Conti so artfully writes without writing over the head of the novice. His ability to do so made the reading process that much more enjoyable-- anyone can pick this book up and immediately better themselves.I hope this book changes your life as it did mine."
1,Cushion just flattens-out.,"I weigh about 205 lbs., and have found this cushion to be useless- It just flattens-out when I sit on it. I will return it if it is possible and economically viable.10/12/10 - E-mail from seller advises there is a 25% restocking fee for returns. I asked for the fee to be waived and they will not agree to do so. I regret making this purchase."
2,cheap,"Worked ok for a time, but after a few months, the foam squished too much and did not provide support anymore. I am only 120 lbs, so it isn't a weight issue."
2,Just doesn't last,"Purchased this product at local 'bedding' store about a year ago. At first, it was the greatest thing for my tailbone soreness. I'm 6'1"", 195 lbs. The foam lasted around 3 months before wearing out. It's now so broken down, the vinyl back of the cushion has fold marks in it from being squashed down so much.This cushion may be what you are looking for for mild pain, and occasional sitting, or even to get you by a pregnancy or surgery. For those with a more chronic case of coccyx or back soreness and pain, I'd recommend looking into another product with higher quality foam.I to remember it smelling like petroleum when I first got it, but it eventually wears off. Rating at first - 5 stars, but for longevity, it provides no relief now - 2 stars."
4,Seat Cushion,It was shipped fast and I enjoy using the cushion. I find it helps ease pain in the tailbone significantly when compared to sitting in the chair without it. I have one for work and home.
5,My butt and back are VERY appreciative!,"This fine product is just amazing! The only issue I have is that it's just a LITTLE bit too wide... and doesn't fit perfectly in my drawer at work... I have to bend it a little, but it's not really a biggie. I noticed results from day 1, and my butt, hips, neck, and back have been getting less and less stiff every day, and I am not just aching by the time I leave for home.I wonder why these kinds of products are so hard to find in stores... or at least stores that are common. These kinds of things are always great, and since so many people have these kinds of issues from work, you'd think that they'd be more readily available in stores. This is just an afterthought..."
3,Not as good...,"This product seems below the quality of one I previously bought at Walgreens althought it has the same name. It arrived wrapped in plastic and without a box, which makes me wonder if I got someone elses return. Seems adequate at best but it is much larger than described in the Amazon product description. I bought it to sit higher in my car, and it is fine for that. If you need something therapeutic for a back problem, I would suggest you go with another product of better quality."
3,comfortable,"This makes driving more comfortable. My rear no longer falls asleep and my back no longer aches. I use this in my car because I am short (4' 11"") and it helps me see over the dash. Also, I take it with me when riding in someone elses car."
1,It's cheap...but you get what you pay for.,This pillow is just a cheap piece of foam. I wore it out after a few weeks. It is worthless now.
3,It's Okay,"This really isn't anything all that special, a pillow does the same thing. Not the worst thing we've ever purchased but certainly would not recommend it, just use a pillow."
4,"Poems for the John: used, but worth it","This product was defiantly well used before I received it, but it was expected considering this is a classic that I knew wasn't being sold in the new form any more. I bought it for a friend's birthday who simply said she liked poetry when I asked what she wanted. It still sits in her bathroom and it's a humorous piece that's pulled out often. My dedication to her goes under the last dedication of the previous owner"
1,Amazon Shipping Strikes Again!!!,I odered the Nokia MBC-15S-AC Mobile Holderwith Antenna Coupler and received the MBC-15Swhich DOES NOT have the antenna coupler. You sent the the holder only package. That sucks!!!
5,Very happy with my Plantronics S12 Headset,"I'm very pleased with the Plantronics S12 Corded Headset System. I use it at work and the sound quality is excellent. The headset is very comfortable. I definitely recommend this product to someone who needs a ""hands free"" phone system - and doesn't want or need to spend a lot of money on a cordless system."
3,Be Sure You Have A Corded Phone,"So maybe I'm not the most thorough reader -- I did read the description twice and checked Plantronics' site (support folks very helpful BTW). No where did I see that this DOES NOT work with cordless phones. And yes, that's what I have. I tried a number of configurations but was only able to listen not to talk. It's going back, of course. The actual operations seemed a bit clunky with the traditional phone's receiver being lifted (as other reviewers mentioned -- they seem to be okay with this). Went with the Mx500i that will work with cordless and skype."
4,I use it at work everyday,"I use this corded headset at work every day. I like the sound level adjustment wheel and the blinky red light on the headset microphone that lets coworkers know I am on a conference call or webinar. The mute button and headset/handset buttons are large and easy to activate (with lights that indicate status). I have used it for a year now with no problems. The only thing I don't like, and it is a minor detail, is the thin cord between the headset and the base tends to twist a little over time (over several days/weeks). To fix the twist, I hold the cord and dangle the headset and let it twist back and unwind. If it had a heavier cord or one less prone to twist, it would be perfect. As is, it is a good functional corded headset with everything you need, and it has lasted me over a year already with no problems. I like the metal stand thingy for the headset too, it is useful and saves desk space."
4,hands free phoning,"headset allows me to talk on phone and still be productive, only downside is it's corded, not cordless, though the cord is pretty long. Mute button on the base of the unit is super helpful for long, ramblling calls. Headset is comfortable"
2,Can't Move Around A Lot With These,I wish I had spent my $80 on something better. I really wanted wireless headsets but got these instead thinking they would be OK. I like to move around when I have these headsets on and the cord gets in the way from the headphones. THey are OK but not worth all of the money that I spent.
5,Plantronics S12 for office,I am very pleased with the performance of this product and intend on ordering 2 more for my staff.
3,Corded Headset,"The Plantronics S12 is a solid corded headset. Good clarity and easy to use.Make note that this is corded - mistake on my part. I was looking for a wireless.One item that could be improved is a longer cord from headset base to phone base. It is only 12"" long."
2,Low quality item,"I tried to make this headset work since it is comfortable and easy to use but the most important factor, the sound quality, just isn't what it should be. Missed the return window for a full refund but still sending it back since I really find this item to be useless."
1,The headset never worked,"I tried the headset with a different phone and never worked. the base did work with different headset I had, but return the whole thing"
3,Great sound/shabby headset,"Being that this is a Plantronic headset I had an expectation of quality. The system itself is wonderful, the headsets are horrible. I wanted to use the over the head unit, first it pulled my hair each time I took it off, then the protective piece that sits against your head keeps falling off making the headset poke into my head.The other choice is the over the ear holder. Cheap scratchy plastic was used and it's not comfortable.I've put my own little end on mine and taped it there and I'm only willing to do that because I'm happy with the sound and ease of use. I hope they come out with some other alternative to the crummy plastic used on the headsets!"
5,So very pleased with this purchase,The price was phenomenal and the unit works like a dream. I have told so many of my co-workers this is the only way to go.
5,Plantronics Rocks,Plantronics S12 headset is comfortable and operates with ease. Volume controls for your voice and listening are easily adjusted. Some feedback if the base unit is too near electronics. Just move a few inches away to resolve the issue. Unit is durable and simple to install. Great investment for the home office.
3,Cord Far Too Short,"I chose the S12 because it was the only reasonable cost headset system I could find that had a volume control for the headset microphone. However, the cord Plantronics provides for connecting the S12 to the handset port of my desktop phone is 10 inches long, and is far too short when I place the S12 behind my desktop phone. In order to use the S12 with my phone I had to replace the 10 inch connecting cord with a normal handset cord, which is far too long. The best option will be to purchased a 15 inch to 20 inch connecting cord at a cost of perhaps $10 to $15. Plantronics could have provided a 20 inch cord in place of the 10 inch cord at very little extra cost."
5,"Works great, good value","Works great, good value. The device met all my expectations and lived up to all of its claims. I spend approximately 4 hours a day on the phone and place 30 to 40 calls. For this usage this device works just fine. If I was on the phone much more I would upgrade to a device that was more comfortable and one where you didn't have to remove and replace the hand set on your phone to start and end calls."
5,Good size and efficient,"Plantronics always have made a good product. The package came with two alternative ear pieces, one that you stick in your ear; the other with the headband attached to the ear piece. I personally prefer the latter. The ear piece has a cushion and the mouth piece is just the right distance. That metal hook provides a nice space to hang up your phones.I believe it is noise canceling, because, I usually play loud music, while I'm on the phone. And I have asked people if they can hear the music, they say they cannot.I personally like the wire connection to the phone as opposed to the wireless. I am told by wireless users, that you have to replace batteries after 3-4 hours of continual use. This is more practical, since it is cheaper and the sound quality is excellent.I have used Plantronic products for more than 15 years. They last a long time. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Sound can't be adequately adjusted,I have tried all of the adjustments recommended in the manual and from goggling suggestions others have also had with this item. I can't get the sound that I hear to be reasonably good. It is not acceptable for a company that specializes in amplifying sound and making phone use easier and better. Furhter this is supposed to be one of their more established products. I have stopped using the headset system and gone back to just using my normal phone headset. I am very disappointed. Waste of money.
3,Huey Pro just OK,"Setting up the Huey Pro is very easy, but getting it to work properly on a dual LCD setup on a Mac is a little problematic. I have it working but it loses its settings which is very easy to fix. Email support is a little slow, and if it is a hard problem they refer you to X-Rite. I have had a problem posted with them for over three weeks still no answer. But even with the small problems I would still recommend it."
1,BEWARE!,"I purchased this item, when it came in I hooked it up and started to calibrate. I immediately noticed the colors did not seem right. After a week of messing up pictures I called into Pantone tech support and discovered this product has a hardware bug that causes a green color cast on some monitors. I have a Samsung Syncmaster 2253bw and it is one of them. As of this writing they say it ""might"" be fixed within a month but can't guarantee it. I have been out time and money and looks like a have to get another calibration system - I just wanted to let people know before they end up like my situation."
1,Does not support 64 bit Mac,"Don't buy this. I wish I could return it and get another product, from a different company. Their support is terrible. They haven't updated the product for Snow Leopard on the Mac, even though 10.6 was released well over a year ago. You have to restart System Preferences in 32 bit, and then the results don't always stay - often times they go away when running your system in 64 bit. And most graphics people are running 64 bit. Their website is terrible and offers no help on this issue and no way to contact them. The product is OUTDATED as of Nov. 2009, and here we are a year later and still no updates. ... 2 years later and not only is there no Snow Leopard update, but no Lion update either.Pantone's customer service is practically non-existent. I cannot stress enough: do not buy Pantone products if you use modern computers."
1,Pantone Huey is bad calibrator,"I don't recommend it!Pantone Huey is very easy to use, but it give a very poor result!I have compared three calibrators: Pantone Huey, Eye-One Display LT and Eye-One Pro.Eye-One Display LT (~$150) and Eye-One Pro ($1000+) made the same result.I recommend Eye-One Display LT.See also my review here (in Russian):[...]"
1,Colors were worst,"I was disappointed in this tool. I had hoped that it would help with color matching between my systems. Instead it made the colors worst, blues became purple on screen while printing blue on the printers. I think I did everything right, but who knows.Bottom line, it was a waste of money for me as it did the opposite of what I thought t would. Too bad."
4,Pretty straight forward set up.. just waiting for more prints,"The setup on this product was very simple. I did not see a huge difference in the ""corrected"" profile it created for my vista machine. I did have 5 prints made from a pro lab and the shots came back looking extremely close to my monitor.overall I would recommentd this product, especially for the price paid."
1,not compability windows 7,"It is said in the pantone site that there is a complete compatibility with windows 7 64 bit. That is a lie. I tried to install, uninstall. Install the site version and nothing. It don't work. Always asks for an upgrade. I bought the huey pro 2 weeks ago, and it is asking for an upgrade, that there isn't available. I had written to pantone and no response and no solution. Not a single word, an excuse an ETA to solution Nothing. They don't care about their costumers. Please stay away from this device if you have windows 7 64 bit, you will be sorry and will lost money."
1,Don't waste time with this product,"I was never able to successfully calibrate my monitor with this tool. Colors were consistently off target after calibration. It turned out that Nvidia's calibration software gave the desired result, and happened to be bundled with the video card."
1,Disappointed,"I have tried calibrating too many times. This was my last straw. I am going by the built in adjustment software on my screens. I have dual screens, so matching is more important. The Huey left them instantly dim and dry. I switched back to my normal profile right away. This Huey was a waste of time and money, just like the Spyder was. I have two laps, a dual screen production desk and a 24"" social computer. I am a pro designer and not one of them has good color because of any of these calibrators. The only thing that makes them good is taking the time to adjust it by eye, which apparently is much truer to life than the Huey sees it. I have no suggestions other than to avoid this product as well as any of the Spyders....I tried them all with great hopes, only to be disappointed."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I ordered the Huey Pro with a misunderstanding of its abilities -- it is STRICTLY a monitor calibrator, nothing else. It will not profile scanners or printers at all. My expectation was based on earlier experience with Monaco EZcolor, which also consists of only a monitor colorimeter and software (and a target print). But by scanning the target print and measuring it on the monitor (after profiling the monitor), it's possible to profile a scanner. Similarly, once the scanner is profiled, a known target file can be printed and then scanned, allowing a printer to be profiled. This is not adequate for demanding professional requirements, but I've had good results with the Monaco system. I needed something new because the Monaco colorimeter works only on CRT displays. I was disappointed that the Huey Pro does not include software to perform either scanner or printer profiling, and I returned it."
1,DO NOT BUY - Same poor results as other users,"I'm sad to report I got the same poor results as the other users. After calibrating, I got a silght pinkish color cast. I tried on two different computer and obtained the same results.I also got the same poor results as other users from customer support. I submitted a trouble ticket per the knowledgr base and got a automated scripted resposnce. The response said that I will be contacted in two working days. It has been 10 working days and I have not heard anything from custoimer service. I tried to follow up with them and still no results.I guess the reviews on this site do have real merit. I will never buy another product from a company that has recieved so many poor reviews.As a result, I returned the huey back to Amazon for a refund.! ! ! Pleae trust the poor reviews on this product ! ! ! !"
1,Product is defective and has been replaced by Color Munki,"Initially very excited to receive this product. Upon installing product and finishing calibration process, had a green tint to my monitor. After reading through all of the many reviews here on Amazon.com and via Google, I discovered that the ""green"" cast caused by this product was a very common issue.I called Pantone today to see if they had any solutions and was advised very promptly to contact Amazon to return the product. I was informed that the huey PRO product had been canceled and it was recommended by Pantone that I purchase the XRite ColorMunki product instead. Apparently the ColorMunki product replaced the inferior and problem plagued hueyPRO product.XRite ColorMunki: [...]I'm not willing to spend $170 on ColorMunki yet so I guess I'll just have to go with the color calibration tools that come with my computer for the time being.Disappointing, but as long as I get my money back from Amazon.com, I'm all good!"
3,It works,"I'm very happy with it. I'm a professional photographer and have been looking for a reasonably priced calibrator. I can't do it with my eyes anymore, and feel like I don't get it right and also have desktop and laptop to synchronize. The product worked great, good to see good color. The only problem, is it is automatically set for 14 days to be recalibrated which I think is too soon, and then the reminder seems to pop on after a few days. There may be a way to set it but it does seem to keep color, just can't do the before and after compare.I researched all the options and did not want to have to go with the $200-$300 and up calibrator and think this one seems to do the job. Have not tested it yet tho with printing at lab or inkjet."
4,"Sleek, nifty design","well as far as laser pointers go... this one is great. The slim design feels great, i have big hands (XL gloves if ya know what i mean) and its a lot easier to manuveur this little puppy around than the last pen style pointer i had. The button is large enough for using your thumb, no more squeezing on some small button with the pinky finger. This is a man's laser pointer, well not because its better or worse then others, just because of dimensions.I found the power to be strong compared to others also (tim and i sat at the office comparing ours this monday ""hey, mine is much brighter than yours"")"
1,"beware, these are tuber indicum, not melanosporum","These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum). I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they aren't fresh), and it is. These are Tuber indicums. It says so right on the label.I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them. So I give JR credit for excellent responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles""."
2,No taste,Had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture. Better off buying the high price truffles.
1,extreme disappointment,"i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed, had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again"
3,On the Verge of being a great book,"One girls journal, is really what it is. She gets partys from Thursday to Sunday, gets ""fitz-chased"" and sleeps with the guy that happens to be there. Perhaps if I were a 25 year old, I'd get it. The fact is I am a 36 year old with a kid and I so do not get it, nor do I want to get it.It probably is a really good book but not for me."
2,BORING & SNOBBY,"Boring, snobbish, direction-less. Eve, the main character, has no substance; rather, she's stumbling along, with a boring life, marveling at her ""Amazonian"" friend who seems to get all the guys, and laments about her terrible job - which is, might I add, NOT a terrible job. I felt like I was wasting my time reading this book, and that's not a good thing. Anyway, save your money. This one is NOT like a Bridget Jones, or any good chick lit for that matter, if that's what you're expecting it to be.IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME!"
4,On the Verge of Great,"While house sitting with nothing to do I found this book. I began to read and could not put it down! When I left I immediately went to B&N; and bought myself a copy because I wanted to finish it NOW!A cute story, funny and light (most of the time) very likeable characters, a great debut."
2,Red Dress Ink Could Do Better,"This is the best-written RDI book thus far, technically speaking. Unfortunately, it's also dull and completely devoid of conflict. Eve, the main character, has no problems until the plot makes them necessary. She gets any man she wants. Her job, while dull, is secure and well-paying. Her friends are fun and supportive. There are vague allusions to her having a desire to write, which later morphs into a desire to publish a magazine, but those are offhanded interludes between the endless drinking and parties she goes to. Frankly, it's just not interesting to read a 300 page book about a woman going out to dinner a lot."
5,I loved this book!,"I have loved all of the books Red Dress Ink has published and I agree with another reviewer that this is the best one I have read. It was extremely funny (I, too, laughed out loud at several parts) and very true to life. It takes a lot for me to be reading a book I simply cannot put down, and this was one of them. It's also nice to read a book by a fresh, funny young female author who really knows how it feels to be looking for something to do that makes you happy. I am eagerly awaiting the next novel from Ariella Papa!"
4,"A perfect Heinlein ""juvenile"" for the 1990s","This book is a perfect evocation of the so-called ""juvenile"" novels that Robert Heinlein wrote in the 1950s, which got many young readers hooked on science fiction. The book has, however, a 1990s sensibility in the use of four-letter words and bluntness about sex that could keep it out of some school libraries. A right-wing sensibility informs the philosophical core of the novel, but the resultant message is that paying attention in class and working hard for the things that matter are the keys to fulfillment in life - which isn't such message for young people to hear. The girls in the book do work as hard and achieve as much as the boys, but it is at heart a boy's novel. If you liked Starship Troopers, you'll like this book too."
2,Well-intentioned But Disappointing,"I bought this novel because it has been compared to Heinleins juvenile stories, which I rather liked. The books feeling, in fact, is right, but apart from that it suffers from an oversimplified plot, rather wooden characters and a hard-to-believe background setting. The science seems correct, but that does not make this book ""hard SF"". I do not know about Sheffield, but if you want to read a good Pournelle, stick to ""Prince of Mercenaries"" or other books of his."
5,Outstanding work on Robert the Bruce and Scotland's War of Independence!,"Being of Scottish descent, I bought this book out of curiousity, since there is a dearth of GOOD historical fiction covering King Robert and the Scottish War of Independence. I am most certainly glad that I found this magnificent work! Charles Randolph Bruce and his lovely wife, Carolyn Hale Bruce, have done a truly wonderful job in bringing to life Robert de Brus and his brothers, as well as Thomas Randolph, and James Douglas, along with King Edward I of England and Aymer de Valence, the Earl of Pembroke and a host of others. The authors maintain excellent historical accuracy while providing very moving humanity to the characters. And, the artwork is spectacular! I very highly recommend this book to all those having Scottish ancestry who want to learn more about their heritage, and even if you're not Scottish, if you like GREAT historical fiction, you will love this book!"
4,The End of the great era.,"Tull was past their prime, but just slightly.Although some great film, just way too short.Too bad we can't get the Thick as a Brick or the Passion Play tour with those songs/albums played in their entirety."
5,Sheherazade,"After hearing Sheherazade lately on the radio, I decided it was time to purchase a copy for myself. I am very pleased with this version. Fills the house with glorious music."
4,"One is depressing, but I love the other two CD's","I ordered this because I felt like indulging my dog...it's nicer than plain classical music as it does not have the heavy crescendos, etc. that may work to excite rather than calm a pet. I love to throw this on in the afternoon after our walk. He sleeps and I get my paperwork done guilt free. Even if you don't have pets, this is fun!"
5,Fantastic. It actually works!,"I couldn't believe it. We were having the most difficult time with our lab. He is the sweetest dog when we are home, but as soon as we leave, he gets angry and chews anything in sight. But after leaving the Pet Music CD's on for him for several days, he stopped chewing. Just like that. Pet Music saved our hardwood floors. Thanks so much."
4,Attack of the attacking strikes forever,"I loved Jean Grae since high school for me, I heard mostly all her music before I got to hear this album. During the time it was hard to find because on the real its hard to find Jean's music in stores anyways..My favorite song on there is ""block"", ""love song"",""live 4 u"" & ""fade out"". I love the album as a whole overall. Ima buy this album, because its that good. Jean Grae was how she started from the begining, witty and strange but idgaf she still the most beautifullest femcees to ever grace the mic"
4,Really Like,"This is taste-specific music. My friend, Bert, asked me to order it for him. He is in his 60;s, and he really loves it."
5,Great intro to J2EE,"The book is a very well-balanced introduction to many J2EE topics such as JSP, Servlets, JDBC, and EJB. Examples are ""as simple as possible, but no simpler"", and are quite useful for understanding the various topics.Obviously this book is now out in the newer edition that covers the much-changed and simplified (yey!) Java EE 5, but for anyone who would need to work with legacy J2EE 1.4 applications this book certainly provides good value."
3,good fights/ poor production value,"The fights are great. The relatively low rating I gave it is due to the technical aspects of the DVD. The picture and sound quality are sub-par. The fights are poorly edited (I don't mind that they edited out some of the lapses in the action, but they often cut off the words of the play-by-play guys mid-sentence when they could have just cut at the end of the sentence) Also, why aren't the fights shown in the order in which they occurred? There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for they order the are shown in."
3,Tyson-somewhat generic,"My DVD did arrive quickly, which was good, but, the first DVD (there are 3) doesn't read/work at all. The fights are not shown in their entirety, and the quality is average or less. Still, it is Tyson, and it was cool to watch!"
1,The Verdict: BUST!,"This record explains why I don't listen to radio, and, more important, it explains why the American versions of the ""Now"" series are a joke. Britney again? J.Lo one more time? One-name-but-no-talent ""singers"" Ashanti and Shakira? People, this is madness. If you wanna get a sample of some interesting Top 40 radio, then pick up the British versions which have the UK hits. Otherwise, you are no worse off tape-recording your local radio station for 30 minutes."
1,"Yeah, right...","""Now"" has to be the most annoying music compilation ever. Their obsession with pop (AHHH) and rap (devil) has reached it's peak in annoyance. Here's what the next few ""Now"" CDs should have:1.Linkin Park-Points of Authority2.Korn-Thoughtless3.Dope-Now Or Never4.Cold-No One5.Slipknot-Left Behind6.Staind-For You7.Disturbed-Prayer8.Systematic-Deep Colors Bleed9.POD-Alive10.Godsmack-Greed11.Spineshank-New Disease12.Static X-Cold13.Murderdolls-Dead In Hollywood14.Stone Sour-Get Inside15.Deftones-Back To School (Mini Maggit)16.Adema-The Way You Like It17.Mudvayne-Death Blooms18.Drowning Pool-Tear Away19.System of A Down-Chop Suey!20.Andrew W.K.-Party Hard21.Orgy-Fiction (Dreams In Digital)22.Deadsy-The Key To Grammercy Park23.Papa Roach-She Loves Me Not24.Rob Zombie-Demon Speeding25.Powerman 5000-Automatic26.Puddle of Mudd-COntrol27.Trust Company-Downfall28.The Apex Theory-Shhh...

Here are the ratings- from 1-10{1 worst,10 best}1. britney spears-overprotected 9/102.kylie m.-can't get you.....9/103.marc a.-I've got u 8/104.nsync-girlfriend 8.5/105.j lo. and NAS-I'm gonna be alright-8/106.paula r.-don't say....-7.5/107.Baha men-can you move it..8.5/108.enrique i.7/109.aaliyah-6.5/1010.b2k-10/1011.ja rule 8/10well anyway, this is a very good cd."
2,Favorite author not up to par...,"I love Lynne Graham and always look forward to her books. ""Dark Angel"" was a disappointment. It was slow and never developed the spark, wit, humor and sexual tension that all her other books have."
3,"Take2, You Disappoint Me","The game has a good feature when it comes to the battle games, but it is missing one crusial thing that makes the monster trucks what they are: car crushing. If that is missing, than the absolute highest I'll give it is 3 stars, and I gave it that because it is fun to rolol over the truck and bang your opponent silly. Overall, OK, But too much is left out."
1,Terrible game,"I rented this game thinking this would be the best game ever. Boy was I wrong. This game stinks. It has very little options, and even though there are five or six multiplayer options, they are all the same thing and they are boring. The controls are terrible, the 1-player is even more terrible than the contols, and the main menu is the most terrible thing of all. I'm suprised this game was even made, it's so terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! If you buy it, you'll 100% regret buying it. DO NOT BUY. EVER."
5,Life changing information,"This book has impacted so many areas in my life. I now have practical principles I can use in my everyday life. I was overtaken by the chapter that deals with, ""stop planting bad seeds in your own bad yard"". This book demonstrated the importance in hanging around the right people and how people you hang around affects your life directly and indirectly. I really appreciated how Pastor Sims dealt with Jealousy and how it can destroy your destiny. If you are looking for truth, Pastor Sims deals with trues that will liberate you in every facet of your life. Thanks Pastor Sims!!!"
5,It never stops being addicting,"Pac-Man, before Donkey Kong, was an even bigger smash hit in the arcades.The NES port of the game does pretty well.The graphics, sounds, and gameplay are all at least the same as the original arcade game.Unlike Donkey Kong for NES, however, people will always find this game to be more addicting.No matter how many times Pac-Man was ported into several other consoles, there's nothing like popping in a Pac-Man cartridge into an 80s console like the NES."
2,Better films out there,so soWarren Oates has done better in other films. He never seems to have beengiven really good roles.
4,Filmed entirely in Oklahoma,"Nice old movie but the highlight for me is that it was filmed in Oklahoma. Scenes from Enid, Oklahoma City, Skirvin Hotel, etc. Movie is decent with some big stars."
4,"Great movie, but still has flaws","I think this was a great movie and a must-have for any 1930's gangster buff. The shootout scenes were fast paced and exciting.I really enjoyed the last bank robbery scene that took place at Mason City, Iowa. However, I didnt think it was a perfect movie.It wasn't very historically acurate, but I wont go into specifics. I also wished there was more of Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd in the movie because they are both very interesting characters. It's a shame that it didn't become more popular because it was probably the best movie ever made on Dillinger."
4,My 3-year-old loves this game!,"Bob the Builder TV GameMy 3-year-old son got this game for Christmas, and he absolutely loves it. There are several different games with 3 levels of each game. He prefers to play the lower levels, but my husband and I actually enjoy the higher levels and play the game ourselves on occasion. :)"
5,"Simple assembly, pretty design",Assembly was very easy by myself. The stand seems very durable and is stable. The design is also more attractive than some other stands and the price is right!
3,"Not my favorite walkman, stay clear of this one","If you buy a walkman, make sure you don't buy this one, I bought it a year ago, and I never liked it. The buttons are too small, not smooth to press, when you press play, you gotta wait a couple of seconds, and I dont need 15 FM stations."
1,Not worth it!,"Used to having jacob's crackers during my childhood when they were still packed in a tin container.Longed for that buttery, fresh taste made me ordered one and share my memories with my kid.Big mistake, these are not fresh, and taste like cardboard. My son looked at me as if he was missing something.May be we can get the good ones in UK, until then...."
3,Barth Through and Through,"Where Three Roads Meet will appeal to the most ardent Barth fans. If you love deconstructing a story more than reading one, you'll love this one. Actually, it's 3 stories, each more stripped of narrative structure than the last, and all meeting each other, of course. Barth is clearly having fun with the reader as much as he is with his characters. And his constants, of course--the Mid-Atlantic, college and academia, the middle class, the Cold War, etc.More of a lit theory companion piece than anything else, Where Three Roads Meet has the author in command of a genre he himself has more or less created. Barth is like a magician performing old tricks with more dexterity than ever to a familiar audience. Full of puns, wordplay, and none-too-abstruse symbolism, the book strolls along with flirtatious self-analyzing flourishes and self-congratulatory élan."
4,Good read,"Bit old school tech but still useful, left me wanting more detail. probably thre best FWD setup book I have found so far"
2,Think twice about a cape style,"This style appealed to me because it's different from a sweater and I thought it would be especially warm. I didn't think it through, because the cape style limits movement. It's probably fine for a sedate walk, but if there's running or playing involved, stick with something that has sleeves.I thought the inside would be fleece and it's actually a quilted nylon, a lot less warm and a bit slippery too, since there's nothing to keep it centered on the dog's back--it keeps sliding sideways.Also, this ran a bit larger than other XS items I've bought."
4,Hope and support for anyone dealing with terminal illness,"This book was a selection for our book club, and it was a good conversational piece. It would also be a good book for any church library.It is one of three book about the traveling salesman, Vernon, so if you enjoyed it you could read more, and maybe even find peace for something that is effecting your life."
5,Great Album,"I love this album. Her style could be compared to KT Tunstall but Abigail stands on her own with strong vocals and great lyrics. After listening to the music I decided to checkout her website and found that she also runs a charity called love146 which helps to fight child sex trafficking. Great music and a good cause, I can not wait to hear more from Abigail."
5,great fit,I use this on Allison Transmissions on transit buses and I am able to get to one cooler hose with out taking the back of the tranny apart
3,CD for music lovers of all kinds!,"I'm a soundtrack fan but rarely does a soundtrack fully impress me to a large extent. Stuart Little 2 Soundtrack is probably better than most of the ones that I have ever purchased. I went on to listen to it more than twice. This CD includes great classic favourites, some redone by newer artists and it crosses the musical genre boundary to include songs from various styles of music. Mandy Moore's 'Top Of The World' is definately among her best while Chantal Kreviazuk's 'Another Small Adventure' is a fun offering and she's definately an artist that you'll be hearing more from in the next few months. Other great songs include Shawn Colvin's light hearted 'Hold On To The Good Things', 'Count On Me' from Billy Gilman and Celine Dion's 'I'm Alive'."
4,Great value,"I have been looking for the Gilbert O'Sullivan hit, ""Alone Again, Naturally"" for quite some time. This song has only been available on albums ranging from $10-$14. At $1.98 on Amazon, I considered this a good buy. The sound track had a number of other great hit songs."
3,Hyperboyle in the title,"Stacey gave me this book last year for Christmas. It is written by Simon Winchester, who also wrote The Professor and the Madman, which was a fascinating book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. This story was a bit more challenging to get through. I did learn many interesting things, but the topic was just not as thrilling, nor was the story or the telling as compelling. And clearly the title engages in hyperbole. Not entirely sure I can reccomend this book in general, perhaps if your really into geology.One interesting fact: the largest division of time is eon, of which there have been four, the current being the Phanerozoic, which means ""visible life"". The division goes from eon, to era, periods and epochs."
5,Excellent value,"I bought this for my wife. She loves it. It's well balanced and well made. For the price, it's everything we expected only better. I would recommend it to anyone who was a hobbyist player."
2,Revisionism intrudes on Reality,"While Cumings makes interesting points, especially on the early days of Korea, his discussion of modern history is way too revisionist. The ludicrous idea that the United States bares the brunt of the blame for the Korean War ignores both the US attempt to save as much of Korea as possible from Stalinism, as well as Stalin's secret endorsement of Kim's invasion BEFORE it happened (known because Soviet archives have been opened).,"
4,One of the three best books on Korea that I have ever read.,"I have read many books about Asia. I currently live in Korea, speak Korean and work as a ""Korea Expert."" It was a relief to find a book that actually looked at Korea as Korea, and not as a vassal of China or a colony of Japan. The author's views tend to be a bit left of center, but this does not detract from the overall solidity of the book. Excellent reading!!"
5,Awesome!,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old son and he loves it! It has options to play music, or count. The animals bob when you push it. He is in awe of it! I highly reccommend it!"
4,required reading,Purchased as required reading for a graduate course. Useful information. Will be referring to this book throughout my teaching career.
2,Didn't even attempt to stick to the title,"Investment Blunders of the Rich and Famous? A great title for a book that enticed this sucker to buy it. But really the book is nothing but a general examination of investment theory. Let me save you the purchase of the book. You can't beat the market and studies prove if you try you will waste too much money in brokerage comissions. How depressing!!!And who are these rich and famous? They are nowhere to be found. He does have a chapter of famous losers like Nick Leeson who broke an English bank and Robert Citron who bankrupted Orange County California. But that is as close as you get to this misleading title.About the only positive I found in this book was an in-depth study of investor's behavioral patterns. Overall, I'd recommend you pass on this book."
2,"Very Disappointed, slow and boring","The Way Back was supposed to be my kind of movie, an inspring tale of man's struggle to survive. But what I got was a long and boring movie without much to be inspired by. Good effort put in by the actors, but just not much of an effort to explore the effects of injustice and the struggle to overcome injustice."
3,The Way Back,"This movie is a true story based on the book written by Slavomir Rawicz, called ""The Long Walk"". Having read this amazing account of the author and 6 fellow prisoners who escaped from a Soviet labor camp in Siberia in 1941, I felt somewhat disappointed with the movie. I must admit that the producers did follow the book fairly closely, but there is such detail in the book that can't be found in the movie. I recommend for the avid book reader to get their hands on this book. You won't be able to put it down. Slavomir Rawicz lived in England after the war, settling in Nottingham. He died in 2004."
1,Deception,"As individuals, what the Jake's did is unbelievably heroic. As individuals, they exercised their rights to join the Freemen and put their lives on the line. What this book does not reiterate is that the Jakes were not individuals, but pawns of an overbearing and tyrannical government. We must commend the Jakes as individuals, we must abhor them as slaves of their government. The government has no rights in our lives as individuals, and they have no right to risk individuals lives for their own selfish wants."
2,Agree with other two-star ratings,"I gotta say that I agree with the other 2-star reviews. While I think that this recording mildly succeeds at creating a relaxing mood, as actual *music*, it's lacking. It's just a lot of chord progressions that don't go anywhere, unresolved phrasing, random structure, etc. I realize this sounds like music geek babble, but these are just ways of saying that, as music, it's pretty annoying to listen to. As another reviewer stated, it's not very relaxing to listen to droning tones. If you are effectively relaxed by what I would call ""calming noise"", then perhaps this would work for you. But if you're looking for something that sounds like logical, calming, relaxing *music"", I'd recommend something like ""Sleep Therapy"" from SonicAid's."
4,It just goes on and on and on....,"(...) I have no idea when this game will end. I just goes on and on, puzzle after puzzle. The key of Babe is to bark at the sheep and guide him past the flags. It may sound simple but believe me once you get into the abandoned house you have to think wisely so that your sheep wont fall down a hole or something. This game ables you to master the ability of thinking carefully before you make a move. Have fun!"
1,A Tribute of the Year: The Worst Tribute of the Year,"I tried to give this 0 stars. Faith No More has to be my favorite band ever and I saw this in the store and immediately scrutinized the details. I didn't recognize any of the bands but I bought it any ways. Bad choice. Most of these bands are electronic bands and I am a fan of a lot of electronica artists but these bands were horrible. The other bands were hard rock bands, they were terrible as well. Although I dislike every song on this album, the bands must have some following to even be able to exist at all. DO NOT PURCHASE. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,"Horrible, only one point worth mentioning...","The other reviewers have pretty much nailed it on the head with this one. Come to think of it, getting nailed on the head almost sounds like a better option than listening to this again. But one thing worth noting is the appearance of the band TUB RING on here. There's a slight FNM connection there in that they have been produced by Trey Spruance of Mr. Bungle/Secret Chiefs/insert the other million side projects here. Honestly, if I want to hear Bungle, I go for Bungle, not for some band trying to sound like Bungle like Tub Ring or those other boys, Dog Fashion Disco. But, it's not a bad attempt and I can't fault them for trying. Other than that bit of trivia though, this double-cd is a complete and utter waste of time (as are most of these tributes). Definitely avoid this one like the plague."
1,Yawwwwn...,"This game is terrible. Godzilla walks at a snail's pace (isn't the American G supposed to be fleet-footed and agile?) and all you do is move your head up and down and shoot little snotballs (supposedly his atomic breath, but it looks pretty lame) at toy helicopters. You can also stomp and tail whip and slap, but it's all the same after awhile. The graphics are decent for GBC, but the game play is non-existant and the storylines are just a few random lines taken from the TV series. Furthermore, if you have the patience to sit through the monotony of the levels, it's way too easy. GODZILLA THE SERIES like Space Invaders, but it's not as much fun. Even hardcore fans will have a hard time liking this one."
5,Godzilla is great!,"Someone is messing with Godzilla's brain,so he is going to mess with them.In this game you battle through six levels of action-packed adventure.I loved fighting machines and monsters."
4,Excellent introduction to culture and cultural arifacts,"I used this in a grade 6 classroom. At first I didn't think they got much out of it but when we went on to other lessons, I noticed an amazing improvement in how quickly these students grasped the new cultures we studied as compared with students from previous years."
4,Not quite what I wanted,"Cute shoes, but I thought they would be a little more furry inside and they ended up being too big. I returned them and ordered something else."
5,Beautiful Work of Art,"This album is beautiful. Azam Ali puts true emotion into her angelic voice. I am happy to have this CD in my collection.Offerings still stands as my favorite, but truly with any of the albums an ambient sound-feast awaits the listener.If you love DCD give Azam a chance, she truly is gifted!"
2,"It's OK, but get a real deal instead.","If Loreena McKennitt and other new age via medieval stylists are your cup- go for it. If you want actually know how this music might had sounded like when it was originally performed- don't bother, but rather get CDs by Montserrat Figueras, Trio Medieval, and other early music specialists."
2,"A look at Oral Roberts, Richard Roberts and ORU...","...that I can't completely swallow as being mostly fact. The author is obviously hurt and that is understandable but I wonder if this is supposed to be an ""airing of her soul"" book or a ruthless tell-all. Some would say there is a reason why this book is out of print and there's a part of me that agrees.I found her stereotyping of men to be annoying though understandable. Ultimately, this book shows that no man or religious empire should be put on a pedestal.In the end this is worth a read but I would balance it withExpect A Miracle, My Life and MinistryDon't get me wrong, I don't agree with a lot of the theology that has come out of the Oral Roberts camp but this book may make him out to be a villian which I don't believe he or his son are/were. We all have faults and blindspots, that's why there's grace."
4,The Importance of Paternity,"Although an insightful book, it overlooked a very important issue, that of Paternity. Polygamous and temporary marriages in Iran although legal are socially frowned upon within mainstream society. They are prevalent, although in small percentages amongst the very rich and the very poor, I guess both having very little to lose. A temporary marriage is socially akin to an illicit affair.When a man takes a second wife, he hides it. Of course in any society there should be room fo fully-grown adults to live theur lives as they choose. But children should be protected. This above all is the central issue. In all such cases fathers are made legally and socially responsible for children that are born within such liaisons."
4,It's OK,"Not all cables are created equal. While this cable can hook up to my phone and camera to transfer files, it cannot transport enough power to bring my portable hard drive on. In contrast, if I use the original Canon cable for my camera, the Hitachi portable hard drive works fine. So if you want a cable just for charging and transferring data between your phone/camera and computer, this is an acceptable one. If you need a replacement cable for your portable hard drive, you may want to look for a different one."
4,Receiver has good sound quality for video and music playback,"This product offers good sound quality and upgrade possibilities(preouts/5.1 channel inputs). There are enough digital inputs and the internal management of speaker placement adds a nice touch. Some ambiance enhancements add too much reverberation, however they can be user adjusted. The 80 watts fills a pretty nice size room, (even with second floor valted ceilings). Overall good remote w/learning mode."
5,Golden Rules of Marriage,"My husband and I were having marriage troubles. It was getting to the point were we would go days without speaking because I hit the snooze alarm too many times. I never thought I would buy a DVD as a source of help for our troubles, but I took a gamble on this one. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved hearing the advice and stories from the couples that have been married for 50 years or more. Not only did it make me feel better, it has also improved my marriage. I still have to wake up 3 hours earlier than my husband, but now we can talk about our troubles in a more proactive way. There are so many heartfelt stories and useful strategies throughout the DVD that you will not be disappointed."
3,Good first solo for Richard Carpenter,"This album is definitely worth purchasing. I enjoy the entire album from beginning to end. My favorite track is the upbeat, I call it dance pop tune, ""Say Yeah"". It has a great rhythm and driving guitar chords. This could have been a hit single. I also like the song ""Who Do You Love"" with it's Beach Boys type harmonies. ""When Time Was All We Had"" is a beautiful and simplistic song featuring Richard's lead vocal and keyboard with Herb Alpert playing flugelhorn. The Song is a tribute to Karen. The album also had a top ten Adult Contemporary hit with ""Something In Your Eyes"" featuring lead vocal by the incomprable Dusty Springfield."
2,"Good, but too familiar...","Good solid album, though a little telegraphed at times. If you are at all familiar with Supertramp's ""Breakfast in America"", anything by ELO, Grandaddy, Stereolab or a ton of other bands I could name, then this record won't blow you away, because the entire package seems a little TOO familiar-- the vocal line from ""Another Mellow Winter"" is copped directly from the Beatles' ""How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people""-- at times it seems like they are trying to rewrite every song in the 1967-68 Beatles catalog. But hell, I guess that's a pretty noble pursuit, in the age of Limp Bizkit and Eve 6... A decent package, sounds great on headphones, worth buying."
3,Walkman,"It's a nice and cheap walkman and ""It's a Sony"". It's sice is ideal for long walks hearing your favorite music"
5,"I Love It!! hmmm... where can I rate this 25,000 stars...?","I would recommend this to everyone! It has all four irish tenors, and it has a mixture of different songs from all their CD's! The only problem, in my opinion at least, is why do they have ""Molly Malone"" on it? There certainly are much more appreciated songs than that, and it certainly isn't one of their best. I wish they had ""Red Is The Rose"" with Finbar Wright singing in it instead of John Mcdermott for once. Maybe they'll have that on their next album they're working on! Can't Wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(Ah-em... you can tell I'm enthusiastic...)"
3,It's okay,"I bought this because it received rave reviews, but it was alright. It's really designed for people who have no idea where they want to go with their careers and not necessarily for those who are looking for a minor change. It provides a lot of thought provoking, reflective ideas for self-assessment, but no substantive information in regards to actually working in a different field in 48 days. I would recommend this for a person who needs guidance on how to begin thinking in a way which highlights his/her personal strengths and weaknesses."
1,Very disappointed,"I have a large amount of respect for Dave Ramsey and he refers to this book often so I thought I'd give it a shot. It is worthless, it seems every page has a definition on it. For example ""Websters defines irritating as...."" It felt cheap and slapped together I am glad I bought this used rather than new. Big letdown I won't buy a book solely because of Mr. Ramsey's recommendation again."
1,Keep religion out of business.,"Had I realized I was going to be bombarded with scripture I would never have made this purchase. I heard the author on NPR and was impressed. After eight years of murder, mayhem and fraud in this nation, all done in the name of Christianity, under the Presidency of George Bush I feel there is no room outside of family for this constant preaching. So much damage is done when religion ventures outside of an individuals personal beleifs. Keep it to yourself."
2,"A semi-useful read, but...","""48 Days"" to everything wonderful is a reach... I could read a book of famous quotes and become similarly informed. And I wish Dan hadn't solicited reviews in his ""Mastermind"" email comms (note how many reviews appeared on 04/21). I tried to say so more privately, but the Contact section of his web-site prohibits easy feedback. Anyway, ""Quotable Quotes"" in Readers Digest (do they still do that?) contains 70% plus of the same info if read regularly. I think all I really got from the book was the bit about identifying personal competencies."
1,Should have read the reviews first,"I have done a lot of shopping on Amazon and have found the reviews to be accurate and dependable. Unfortunately I bought this on the advice of Dave Ramsey and did not read the reviews. This book is awful. I have read a lot of self improvement books and this is by far the worst.I persevered to the end thinking (hoping) some structure would emerge. No such luck. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is just an endless string of quotes and stories. Half way through the book I found a reference to a site that sounded like it might be some sort of a form to define your interests. Turns out it was just a veiled advertisement to get you to pay $20 on Dan Miller's web site. Give me a break.Give this one a miss."
2,Common Sense Disappointment,"I can see how this book may be helpful for someone who is caught in the 'hamster-in-a-wheel' mentality, but for me after reading the book, I still felt a sense of uncertainty regarding my own career path. So, I took the 48 Days Career Profile the author notes in his book. After spending the money for the personality profile, stupidly, it offered no greater insights and looked like the same type of personality evaluation you'd get from the high-school guidance counselor. In fact I think the one I had in high school was more relative and penetrating. My opinion is that the book is purposely ambiguous and fluffy so that you do purchase more of the author's products."
1,Disappointing,"I am a long time collector of Robert Vavra's books of horse photography. I have every one of his earler works, and in them, every page is a treasure.That is why I took the chance of ordering this book sight unseen. It was a gamble and I lost. In Mr. Vavra's earlier works, page after page would be filled with gorgeous horse photos. In this book page after page is wasted on photos of extreme closeups of parts of horses: the extreme closeup of an eye, the tip of a nose, the end of a flying mane. Not just a few of them, but literally half the pictures in the book look that way. Very artsy, I am sure, but not what I wanted. There are only a tiny handful of really beautiful horse photos, of the quality I have seen in his ealier books. This is not a good book for a lover of horse photography. I would suggest finding one of Mr. Vavra's ealier books---they are fabulous and worth every penny. This book was not even worth the postage to ship it."
4,Great Kids' Cookbook!,"I haven't posted many reviews but when I noticed this book had not received any reviews yet I felt compelled to add my own.This is a wonderful book for teaching children to create their own gourmet dishes---ones they will enjoy, too! What I especially appreciate about the book is the premise that children will live up to the teachers' expectations and that they can truly create wonderful things in the kitchen with a little guidance. Too many children's cookbooks are very simplistic with seemingly boring cooking activities for children---how many times can children make a peanut butter sandwich? That's not the case with this book. After looking through it, and then using it to teach my own children, I understand why this cooking school in Aspen is so highly regarded.I hope to teach my own children's cooking classes one day and this book with certainly be by my side![...]"
5,Earl the Squirrel,This book is very enjoyable to the preschoolers I work with. They liked all the black and white pictures except the attention getter red scraf.
3,Tube Sock...,"This thin book covers multiple Challenger & Buckmark models.Therefore many of the photos did not match my particular firearm.I found ""disassembly"" instructions but no ""reassembly"" guide.The manual simply advised you to reverse the ""disassembly"" process."
4,Helped me never forget...,"I found this to be an amazing read. I found myself reading a few dozen pages and stopping, simply astonished at what the most scientifically advanced society let itself believe, and do to millions of children; then returning and reading more. It took almost a month to whittle through it. Combine this with, say, Thomas Sowell's ""Vision of the Anointed"" and one hears a modern day echo of the kind of elitist thinking that rationalizes ethnic clensing. Or how, if unrestrained, Wahabi Islam would exterminate we infadels with similar panache'. This book made me THINK!"
1,Bai Bai,"I bought the cassette in a bin for 25 cents and actually felt cheated. These are meaningless songs filled with every predictable musical cliche imaginable! Ultimately I said, ""Bye Bye"" to Hai Hai and gave it away to a friend with some other cassettes when I updated my music collection.If you enjoy Supertramp, check out Roger Hodgson's 1st solo album ""In the Eye of the Storm"" or ""Open the Door"". They are far superior to this. Also, Roger's work in Ringo Starr's All-Star Band was excellent!"
1,Mediocre at Best,"I'm sorry, but this project does nothing for me. Believe me, I am a huge Supertramp fan and I love Eye Of the Storm and his latest Open the Door. I knew about this CD, but had not listened to it until recently. It's not horrible; it's just background noise. There isn't one song on here to make me want to listen to it again."
1,Not Enough To Tell,"I'm sorry but I don't hear a long enough cut, to tell if I like it or not. I have been playing music off and on, since I got out of the Army in 69. I can't get a feel for the texure. Yours Truly Bob Dowell"
4,great all around,"Great songs, great arrangements, great solos, great recording quality. Since I'm a big fan of T. Monk, I especially liked the Bolero arrangement of my favorite song he composed."
5,Quickly on your way to rock keyboard...,"This video features Tom Gimbel, keyboard player for Aerosmith and grad of Berkelee College of Music, among other accomplishments.He will teach you rock solid keyboard basics that'll get you on your way to jammin' as a soloist, and what you need to know to play with a rock group. Tom reviews all the basics: proper hand positioning to help you develop the most effective techniques, chords, intervals, and importance of keeping good timing by starting slowly and building good speed.Learn to play the most popular rock progressions and scales that every rock keyboard player must know. Learn to create effects with the modulation wheel and pedals as well as the licks, tricks, and turns that all rock keyboardists use to generate the gutsy bending and sliding sounds of rock 'n roll. With practice, persistence, and determination you can be jammin for fun or making professional music after this one simple, comprehensive session."
4,highly recommended movie with two stunning performances,"upside: two excellent actors give outstanding performanaces. a glipse into the personal lives of two dentists. the irony is their ""life"" represents the lives of all people.downside: not one you would watch over and over. but well worth the watch one time.overall: this movie evoke true emotions, touches ""close to home"" giving married couples a sense of familiarity and recognition. highly recomended."
4,Excellent Resource,"This book is a great resource for getting a ""bigger picture"" understanding of GOD's word. I used this book when I taught a Bible study. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is, at times, brief. However, it is great to new believers who want to gain a bigger understanding of the Bible."
5,"Compact, well-made!","Another great toy! This rabbit feels compact; not too squishy for those dogs that like to get their teeth into it. Sewn well and will last awhile before being torn apart. The ears will go first, but so far he hasn't been able to pull the ear off in one pull. As of now the ears are still attached and he played with it for about 10 minutes...almost a record in our house!"
4,I thought that the refrence content was great.,"But the art content really sucked, THe pictures seemed not to fit the characters profiles at all except for Fail, perrin, Lanfear, Rand and the shadowspawn. I also noticed a lack of two people, the former keeper of the staff and MIN , she is one of rands lovers and a major part of book and u dont even include her, that is in sulting"
4,Wheel of Time returns,"While this isnt a story in itself it can help to answer those long put off questions you might have about your favorite wheel of time characters. I knew what this book was when I bought it, and was only disappointed by one thing, the graphics. The details about the forsaken and such were great, but I guess when you read a series you get your own images of characters, and when those images dont match what you have in your head you can be disappointed. Never-the-less I would buy this book again in a heartbeat. If you are a fan, consider this to fill out some of those characters."
2,"Good book, Very BAD art.","I found the art work in this book to be very poor. The novels describe scenery and characters in such vivid detail, that I was insulted by the high school art class illustrations. The information in the book is quite good but after seeing the art I put it down and doubt I will pick it up again."
5,Absolutely brilliant,This book revolutionises the wheel of time. This is by far the best creation of Robert Jordan yet.I am very sattisfied by this book and will tell all my friends about it. Robert Jordan is one of the literary geniuses of our time and will remain in our memories forever. The wheel of time is a vivid series.Robert Valentine(Avid Fan)
4,The usual...bad art,"While reading through the series, I found it hard to remember all the extra info abotu everything. This book is a good way to reference that information. The art was awful though. Avienda is supposed to be hot, and she wasnt. Same with Elayne and Lanfear. I was disappointed. :("
2,Yet another required book,"This was just another required book for a college class that I wish I had passed on. I wish I had passed on it because 1. it has nothing to do with the class, and 2. really didn't have any good information in it. It provides little information and is really more about movie creation than meaning behind movies. apparently ""Movies and creating them"" didn't roll off the tongue quiet like Movies and meanings. Anyway, this is one that I'd say pass on because the title is misleading"
2,EH,It wasn't kidding when it says introduction. I'd expect a movies for dummies book to include more than this. I regret buying it.
4,"A bit rough, but good","The cover for my book seemed to have been roughed up a bit beyond what I was expecting, but otherwise, the book is in excellent condition and ready to be used."
2,No butter flavor in my batch.,"The popcorn pops up nicely, but is flavorless. I liked that it was not salty but where was the butter flavor? Based on the positive reviews, maybe I received a bad batch. I canceled my subscribe and save as I did not want to chance receiving another tasteless shipment. On a positive note, the birds that visit my backyard seem to really like it."
4,GREAT BRITISH BAND,"If you like real metal, one played with intelliggence, simplicity, aggression and creativity, this is a must. NIGHT OF THE DEMON is the first DEMON album ( of only two worthwhile albuns they released). But the vibe is so good, production also, that the resulta was stupendous. I was eagerly awaiting for this reissue. At last it came.(but it was not released in America yet). Band line-up - Dave Hill - vocals; Mal Spooner (died of pneumonia); Les Hunt - lead guitar; Chris Ellis - bass; Joh Wright - drums. All songs were written by Hill / SPooner. The actual DEMON who released SPACED OUT MONKEY has only Dave Hill from the originaal formation."
2,not all muslim names...,many of these names are urdu/hindi names. non-arabic speaking muslims may not know that they are picking an not necessarily islamic name for their child.yes - there are many websites available for name now - but MANY are inaccurate in regards to meaning and origin.
1,Yanomamo Video,Dated and not the most accurate accounting. Clearly some scenes are staged. I spent 6 months with this group years ago and teach anthropology. I will not show this again to my students.
1,Awful,"I was in for quite a shock when I bought this as I was subjected to one of the poorest written books ever published. I kid you not. It is an uninspired story of tired overused characters in a cliche world. It fails miserably to entertain.The first problem is McCloskey's prose. He writes with a total lack of imagination. Every paragraph seems to drag on, and go no where.The next problem is the dialog. It is simply poorly written. Who talks like that? Did anyone ever talk like that?Third, the story is so cliche it really isn't worth getting to the end to see what happened.With so many other good stories, you are better off looking elsewhere."
3,A nice read but not Brockway's best,"The book is enjoyable but I found the hero a little too physically rough with the heroine. If you've read other Brockways, this one is still a nice read. You can enjoy it. . .but the other's are better. ""All Through the Night"" and ""My Dearest Enemy"" have more well rounded characters and to me Brockway's ""As You Desire"" is superior to all of her other novels."
5,Gay Christmas,This movie is a repeat watch! It is a movie that has great love for all that is involved. The characters are funny. The mother of Gun is alittle overboard at times. I love the coming out process of Gun.
4,This was a fun film to watch,This was a cute gay holiday film. What a range of characters. You will get a goodlaugh out of some of them.
5,A must have,Got this purely by chance and its now a beloved film. definately a must have in your dvd collection. Never gets old.
2,fast forward PLEASE,"Cliche Cliche Cliche! I bought this mainly because I am a Gates McFadden fan. I felt like she was here just to collect a paycheck. The movie had a few funny moments; a ton of stereotypes ( Clueless high school girlfriend); all ends well for this progressive family unit. If you have to fast forward through the painful acting, just to get to the end of the movie, how likely are you to repeat view the film ?"
5,Great book covering American and British Women's history,"Although I used this book primarily for American Women's history, it does a great job with British history too. The book is well organized, looking at american and british women's history separately by decades starting with 1900 and going through 1995. In most cases, each chapter is divided by politics, work, social life and sex."
5,A Better Voice,"What I like about Ken Bruen and most of his books, including this one, is his original voice and take on dark thriller or Detective Noir novels. For the most part they're quick reads, until you tumble upon some remarkably well written passage that makes you stop and appreciate the writing style.I ordered a used copy of this one and received an autographed copy so it was a bonus on top of it being a good book. Bruen reminds me of Cormac McCarthy, Jim Harrison, and James Lee Burke with their talent for giving you unique characters caught in some bloody awful situations, not to mention some really evil bad guys the semi-good guy has to contend with.So, do I like all of his books? Naw, not all but the bulk of his work makes for some good reading, some memorable characters, and better books than you'll find on the bookshelves today."
1,I don't know why people like this smell...,"I've been a fan of febreze. I like the smell of the original. When I saw this online (which I mistakenly thought was for a pack of 9) I instantly jumped on the order for such a good deal. That issue was resolved, and that's not my complaint. What I really dislike is the smell. I got the Meadows & Rain scent and I'm not sure how to describe it... not sour... maybe a little bitter? As if this kind of product could expire. I don't know if it's just my nose, or just the bottle I got, but I really dislike the smell of this particular scent."
3,"Very creepy, but good read","Not much to say about this book. It's a light, sweet read that made me laugh out loud more than once. Some of the twisted fairy tales are very disturbing, however. Others almost made me cry. I actually fell in love with Rumplestilskin. He's amazing.Anyway. Cute read. And most of the tales are great for little kids. I thought the ""Rated PG-13"" on the back was a joke, but after reading it I see that it's not, not really. It's not inappropriate at all for anyone over 13 I think. Just a little creepy."
3,A fun read.,"I've always liked manga, and used to collect comics, but this is my first manga I've owned. Well worth the dollar I spent for it at Goodwill. It was about an hour read. Black and white comic, good action and humor. A bit of violence. Yes the girls are all busty, and there's a few panty shots, but nothing to get offended about. This is rated for older teens and up. No foul language that I recall."
3,A Mercedes coffee table book.,"Mercedes-Benz Silver Star Century gives a general overview of the history of these cars and the company. The book is logically laid out and is well illustrated, but many of the photos we have seen before in other Dennis Adler books. There is little depth to the text and many common models are omitted completely. In a series of almost identical Denis Adler Mercedes books this is probably the best there is but... It makes a fine coffee table book."
5,The author was a pioneer in the study of OCD,"Some of the other reviews down this book, saying it is out of date, but it was written in the 1980's. Dr. Rapoport brought relief to millions suffering from OCD. I did not find it depressing at all. She worked with both children and adults. The stories from the patients are both helpful and fascinating. At the time there was only one drug approved for OCD. And she introduced it to millions suffering. Prozac was mentioned in her book but it was not approved for OCD at the time of her publishing.If you read later books on OCD, Ms. Rapoport is mentioned and is quoted in about 80% of them! She was the first to write a book just about OCD. It was extremely helpful! She had stories about actual patients of hers and the agony they and their families had gone through until the drug Anafranil was approved by the FDA.Yes, it is now outdated. But it was the first and the best of its time."
2,Not very good...,"I bought this book several ago but only recently decided to read through it. I was very disappointed. As is true with many prayers that are offered by Christians, the prayers in this book seem to be written as an excuse to sermonize and teach the reader, rather than to earnestly communicate with God. I thought that they were very poorly written.Of course, it is extremely difficult to write prayers for others to read and pray. Prayer is such a personal exercise, that this concept of written prayers almost always seems stilted and forced. The exception to this reality are prayers that come from the Bible, like the Lord's prayer.In any case, I did not find this book to be very helpful. I appreciate the author's intentions, but would not recommend this book of prayers."
3,One battery was broken,"I purchased 4 batteries and one is broken, I am going to contact them to see if they will replace it for me."
4,Pretty much what I expected,These batteries have worked out pretty well. They were reasonable in price and saved me the inconvenience and cost of buying all new wireless phones. Delivery was prompt and the batteries charged fully in about 8 hours. These are a good buy if you are replacing old phone batteries.
5,this is great i love mine,i got it for the price but it's the best machine i've ever hadeasy to use very basic and the pre-recorded message is clearand better than any thing i could have recorded.had it for 8 years + never a problem.
2,"Ok, but not great","I got this about a year ago, needing to loan my betterAT&T box to my inlaws.This works ""ok"" for simply getting messages, when I'm inthe house. I don't like it for other things.No battery backup. Settings lost with power outage, includingany set id for retrieving messages. Time lost. But outgoingmessage, or saved messages appear ok.I'm finally looking to replace it because I can't reliablyretrieve messages calling in. Either the id's wiped, theid is ""invalid"" (even if it isn't), or the last time I triedit didn't even recognize that I was using an id to say itwas incorrect. Very frustrating, only sometimes works.Why can't anyone make a decent machine? I'm noticing veryunreliable machines in these reviews. My old one wasquite usable. This one is difficult, and requires themanual to set anything... 8-{"
3,Sony TAM100 - Good value for basic answering machine.,"I've had this machine for over 3 years. The playback quality is fine contrary to some of the reviews I have seen here.The main buttons are large and easy to press. The unit is small and sleek and looks nice.For $29, it's a good answering machine."
2,I hate it.,"I haven't found anything better yet but the sound quality is terrible. Another annoying feature is that if it loses power briefly, it won't come back online until you push a button."
2,Don't Plan on Keeping This a Long Time,"Extremely compact, above average in ease in out-of-the box setup. Playback voice quality is below average. Owned 13 mos. then the unit died (no display, power brick volts OK). Sony's warranty 1 year from invoice date (mine was on backorder 2 weeks). Great price, but now I need another. :("
2,Huh?,"The sound quality on this this is terrible! I can barely understand what anybody says.I'm annoyed by all of the voice prompts and having to wait for them before hearing my messages. ""m-e-s-s-a-g-e----t-w-o----r-e-c-e-i-v-e-d-----o-n""...I just wish I hadn't thrown the receipt away. :-(has been reliable, and have seen over 20 messages stored on it."
2,Enthusiast Only....,I found the book extremely average being just a bunch of reprinted car magazine articles (quality looks like 2nd generation xerox) that recount road tests mostly of the earlier models...right up to the GTS. There are no high quality pics...all blk & wht...& recommend this only for the 928 enthusiast....It really didn't offer me any pre-purchase advice worth reporting either...
4,A must for the enthusiast and/or prospective 928 owner,"This book is basically a reprint of all the roadtests the publisher could get hold off. They date back to the launch right up to the last GTS.Main disapointment is the quality of the pictures, a 1960's photo copier would have done a better job.A shame as 90% of the written content is very informative.There is an article about buying second hand, very generic and not much detail.Kind of book you can pick up and read over and over,"
3,Pierre Moerlen's Gong - 'Full Circle - Live 1988' (Outer Music),"Hour's worth of decent progressive jazz-rock to be thoroughly taken in here. For some reason, I got more out of this live CD by the post-Gong spin-off than I did the Pierre Moerlen's other live CD from 1980 simply titled 'Live' (see my review). Liked ""Second Wind"" (as this song has sort of grown on me, you might say), the nine-minute somewhat impressive ""Exotic"", the ten-minute ""Leave It Open"", the familiar ""Soli"" and ""Xtasea"" - an interesting way of spelling that word. I know that I used to see this CD several years ago at stores like Borders Books & Music and Hastings at a premium import price. Believe that at later time, 'Full Circle - Live 1988' was reissued on the French label, Musea."
5,mr warmth with Don Rickles,"absolutely the greatest of all comedians even of today. These guys today could really take some lessons from this guy. Very very funny.Greatest comedian reflecting back to the rat packers. Couldn't stop laughing at an age where you go away, he never does. Recommend this to everyone who wishes and does a comic stand up needs to listen to this guy, who uses no ethnic nor bad humor. A class act. Comedians could use this as a training tool.Lisa"
2,"so much possibility, so little achieved","Don Rickles is a showbiz legend. - and the resultsof this DVD can only be described as a pathetic failure. There is virtually no bits of his act, multiple interviews of a host of people who at times don't even talk about Don. ie James Cann going on and on about him and John Wayne, eventually summing up by saying "" he (Wayne) was like a 12 y. o. kid.... and so is Don in a way"" after a ten minute rant he only mentions Don in passing.It did show a bit what he is like off stage/ screen. Overall this is a waste of time and money, save both of yours and give this crap a miss."
4,"Better than 4 MB, but don't trust a vacation to this one","If you shoot low res pix only (640x480), you'll get about 100 pix out of this memory stick, which isn't a bad amount of pix, but it also means you are shooting low resolution. If you're only taking pix for the web, that's great, and this memory stick will get you pretty far. But, if you are hoping to print your images out, you'll want to shoot higher resolution, which means the 16MB memory stick isn't quite big enough if you're hoping to go out on a trip (unless you buy a few of them). I recommend at least a 32MB memory stick.As with all Sony products, this is, of course, well made and solid, and works like a charm. Just make sure you know how much memory you need, and then buy more, always."
4,"Beyond when, where, and who.","A very good read, packed full of information and I like the chronological order in which it is given. Gives much more insight on the Frence politial theatre and how it affected the Legion, then I had expected. It was a niece touch, as it takes the book into the 'why' instead of just reciting the plain history of the legion. The only reason I do not give the book five stars is because, I believe, the writting lacked a bit of passion when and was too clinical in it's descriptions of the various high points of the legion. Here it gave us the who, when, where, and why but did not provide enough details. Very good index, bibliography, and some plain maps in the back of the book for further research if you are interested. To sum up, great book but reads a bit like a college thesis in some protion, well recommended."

4,This book offers great tips for getting the job you want.,"We've all seen the rows and rows of these job-hunting books at the bookstore. I found this one particularly insightful. It is well organized and that structure works well for the intended reader (a job hunter). When job hunting, there are times when you have all the time in the world to casually flip through chapters... Then there are times when you frantically rifle through it, looking for the *one* stage you're dealing with right then! I used this book the last time I was looking for a job and it had the answers I sought at each stage, and gave me peace of mind to be slightly more relaxed during the interview process. (I got the job) There are good tips on unconventional methods of getting your foot in the door of a company that you like. Most valuable to me were: Tips on dressing for an interview. Tips on negotiating salary (very helpful).I highly recommend this book!"
1,horrible,After reading the eExtremly average book of about 350 pages my mind concluded the irrelevancy of the book. I am soory but it was horrible. I would encourage anyone who thinks about buying to not. Can some one explain it to me I would like to hear other coments
1,Same book as the structural 6 min solutions,"I was looking for books to review for the civil portion for the morning exam and structural for the afternoon. This books description said it had both. When I received this book I realized it is the SAME EXACT PROBLEMS as the Six Minute Solutions - Structural I book (which I had already been given by a friend) only the problems were in a different order! Books for this exam already cost a fortune and now this author is selling the same book under two different names, both of which contain outdated and useless problems! Also since this book is just a copy of the structural one it contains no material for the morning civil portion of the exam. This was a complete waste of money, I'd give it zero stars if the computer let me."
5,also ver 2.0,"The one i ordered is also indeed version 2.0 and it arrived in 3 days even though i didn't pay for expedited shipping. Really, you can't get better than that."
1,An outdated view on education,I disagree with the cultural and class biases of the author. Hirsh's books fail to address multiculturalism in our schools today and his ideas of what knowledge is are dated. His books are poorly illustrated and designed like old textbooks. Most children would not find any of his books interesting because they aren't designed to stimulate questions or explore issues or ideas.
1,walks far women,it did look like that move would have been the best but it was so mess up you could not know what the story would be made of
5,Works for Motorola MD671 and MD681 phones too,Like the title says - this battery fits the Motorola MD671 and MD681 base and handsets as well. No problems with charging so far!
3,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,An amazing book when you realize he wrote the book by blinking his eye for every letter. Such a good out look on life
5,Purchased at Amazon.com,"I bought these for a Christmas present for my son-in-law. These are one of his favorite things and he really loved them. Delivered in a timely manner and a huge success. Thank you, Amazon.com."
3,kxrt66,"I am an avid GPSr user and geocacher. I bought this thinking it was like one I had seen with an industrial strength belt clip, but it was a belt loop instead which is not as versatile.It also took Amazon a second time to send a case that fit my Explorist rather than another Magellan model."
2,Buy it used for 39 cents,This is like a notebook for a screenplay. It seems like there's about five characters with interchangeable dialogue. Should make a good movie starring Kelly's (...).
3,NOT QUITE PARADISE,"A fairly good Leonard, kind of typical of most of his books, I get the feeling that they are all fleshed out screen plays. I think that this would, in fact make a good movie. I thought the sub plotting was interesting although I would have liked to see a bit more depth in the characters. Lloyd and Jerome could have certainly used more ink and the entire story could have been another hundred pages and become really interesting. Still and all Leonard uses his formula to pretty good results, an enjoyable if lightweight read"
3,Leonard is on Auto-Pilot (with Hollywood in mind to boot),"I thought the book was a bit ""sad"" and lacking the energeticwit that is most of Leonard's novels. Further, I felt thatthe book was written a little too much in a soon-to-be-a-major-motion-picture style."
3,Ra-ra-ra,"CD/unabridged/fiction: This is my second Elmore Leonard audio. I was reading AirtightAirtightat the same time, which was ironic because they're both involve double-cross. It's an interesting plot that involves a double murder and stupid criminals. I was wondering where the story was going at first and it quickly becomes a murder.I was surprised that the audio was unabridged as it is only six discs long. The narration is done well even though I had to rewind a few times because Robert Forster can narrate too quickly at times."
1,horibble! absolutely horrible,"This book reads like an internet chat room. It has no narrative what so ever and characters keep falling out from nowhere. You think it might get better as you keep reading, but you just get a bigger headache. Not worth your money."
5,Top Ten Stupid Criminals,"""Mr. Paradise"" has its moments, like when the Top Ten Dumb Criminals list comes up, or when Kelly, the beautiful model, sees through Frank the homicide detective immediately, or when Frank tries to concentrate on the crimes he's investigating rather than on Kelly's beautiful body.And then, of course, is the whole idea of the ""almost"" twins play-acting as topless cheerleaders for Mr. Paradise. Or the flip of the coin by Paradise to see who gets which one. (Some TV show loves to depict women jumping on trampolines. Same appeal.)Leonard aficionados will expect the worst, and they'd be right. One chopped up body, cut in six parts by a chain saw. One bungled stock transaction. Three criminals, three shots at a ""business"" meeting. Enough blood and bungling for even the choosiest of Leonard critics. Good job, Elmore.Larry Rochelle, Author of the Palmer Morel Mystery Series"" BLUE ICE, CRACKED CRYSTALS, GULF GHOST, DEATH AND DEVOTION, BOURBON AND BLISS, TRACETRACKS."
1,Absolutely the worst book... total waste of time.,"The best thing about the book is probably the cover. The story starts out ok but has the worst ending ever. Hogan has the two opposing doctors/scientists, after they get infected with the virus, turn into monsters (or whatever you want to call them) and basically fist-fight it out. Come on... that might be ok for a comic book, and is something I may have liked as a kid, but for a novel for adults, it's terrible.Absolutely the worst book I have ever read.Instead, read ""The Hot Zone"" by Richard Preston. Much much better... and it's nonfiction!"
3,great undergroung punk,"this CD has a number of great tracks on it. however the highlights as JeffTuckerExtravaganza, Ruined, and Speedline. I would buy this comp just for the Speedline track alone."
4,"In A Family of Strangers, She Feared for Her Life!","The letter was a godsend. After struggling for so long to make ends meet as a music teacher, Emily Woodstock was astonished to learn that she was the closest living relative to Sir Ralph Woodstock.Suddenly, poor and lonely Emily was a member of a wealthy family, with Edgecliff Manor as her new home. It was all she had ever dreamed, and upon first meeting her handsome cousin Richard, she wondered if she might find riches of the heart as well.But when the death of her uncle left Emily the sole heir to his vast fortune, her dream was shattered for she was certain that someone was out to kill her. Surely it wasn't her charming cousing Charles, or their lovely yet aloof neighbor Evonne DeVere. And even the grim-faced housekeeper did not seem capable of murder. That left only Richard, of dark mind and brooding spirit, the man to whom Emily had given her heart. Would he take her life, as well?"
4,A Great Support at A Difficult Time,"I found the essays very comforting when faced with the death of a beloved family member. Believing, if not knowing, that ""you don't die alone"", that it's only sad for those left behind, that practicing Unconditional Love is the reason for our existence makes the death experience less frightening. After reading this I can more fully celebrate her life rather than mourn her death."
1,Kubler-Ross's Philosophy,"Dr. Kubler-Ross pretends to draw conclusions from here many interviews with those who've had near death experiences. In reality, she mentions some specific cases (over and over) and then begins preaching her philosophy. Her basic belief is that the physical body is essential useless and temporary and we will no longer need it. Also, after death everybody will be super smart and super happy. Typical new-age drivel."
5,Well made and affordable,"My 8 year old son is growing like a weed, and this is his 4th Gi in 2 1/2 years. These uniforms are reasonable priced and well made. Although they are labeled as ""lightweight"" they can easily withstand the rigors of stretching, kata practice, sparring and so forth. Highly recommended for the aspiring karate student."
3,Auto-electronic-geek,"Cheap price , but sizing is totally off. I bought the 00 size for my 4'1"" 7 year old but he is about 75 lbs. Needless to say the top fit but the pants did not. The sizing is weird. Possibally Asian size so the cutting is for slender build. Next time I would go at lease 1 size larger. I figure eventually my kid will grow in it anyways."
3,be careful with size,overall good value and a little thinner than the higher end uniforms. You have to ask for the size chart 1st to buy as i guessed wrong on the size. they were very good at communication/response and overall refunded my stuff. Good Vendor just wished they put the size chart on the website instead of asking for it.
4,Good quality,We ordered several products before we found the right size. This one works great and appears to be good quality.
3,Sizing Charts Vary - Here is the chart from TIGER CLAW,"I ordered a 00 for my 4 1/2 year old who is a little above average in size. Since there was no sizing chart on the Tiger Claw listing, I referred to other charts to ensure I ordered the correct size. I checked the martialarts.com website and it told me the correct size would be a 00, which is what I ordered. It turned out to be HUGE and the sizing chart on the package I rec'd was different. And this sizing chart on the package is different than what another reviewer here lists. The package I have says Tiger Claw right on it and the chart is as follows:HEIGHT WEIGHT SIZE3' 35 00004' 50 0004' 4"" 65 004' 6"" 80 04' 9"" 95 15' 2"" 115 25' 5"" 125 3I now have to order a 000 and hope for the best. TIGER CLAW - PLEASE POST YOUR SIZE CHART TO AMAZON.COM - it would save people a lot of hassle. As far as the quality, it appears very nice, just have not used it yet."
3,"Shipped on time, but the pant are too narrow","Shipped on time, but the pants are too narrow, and it hinders him when he is doing Karate. The quality is good. My son is 5 and I ordered size 000. The size is perfect, the pants are really snug. I am scared to wash it, wondering if it will shrink down more and he cant wear it :("
4,This is a good light weight karate gi.,The sizes from that first reviewer are true. Use that as your guide when ordering. I'll buy my kids' next gi from Amazon when they grow out of this one. Definitely recommend to others.
5,Very nice for the price.,"Great price, especially for a young, new student who may turn out not to like the class. Great condition and fits well."
2,snorkeling in Maui is entirely over rated - so is book,"We went to many spots in this book, and found the rating system to be a little off. In general, the Caribbean offers superior snorkeling to Hawaii, and even the best spot that the authors may rave about in this book is mediocre at best. We also found other guide books to give more accurate info on the best snorkel spots. This book is good if you are afraid of the water or have kids, but those more experienced may actually be better off without the book, relying instead on timely advice from locals."
5,Great Gifts,"These are fun for the little ones and a relief for the parents. I bought these as gifts for my great niece and nephew, and their parents LOVE them."
3,best version of Dylan song by another artist...?,"I would say ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"" by the bluegrass band The Seldom Scene with vocals by the late great John Duffy. Too bad it was left off this CD... would have been a great fit. Also, ""Rita Mae"" by Jerry Lee Lewis (from his late 70's Elektra LP) would have been an cool country-rockin' choice for this collection. Overall, though, I guess this is a nice mix of the obvious and the obscure. And heaven knows there is plenty of material out there for a Volume 2 (including the two I mentioned).Let's hope they're working on that now!"
5,small case,"Can't say anything bad about the product. Easy to open and close. It offers a degree of protection to cameras or small GPS devices. I use it with my Nuvi, but it is too small to hold anything much more then the Nuvi and the it's charger. It does not come with the foam. You must order that seperately!"
4,Book,"I read this book to my daughter over 25 years ago, and order this one as a present to my niece who is expecting her first child."
4,"Just an excerpt, but interesting...","This is an excerpt from the 1100 pages of testimony from the investigation held by the US Senate into the Titanic disaster. It is dry reading in parts, and sometimes repetitious, but Kuntz manages to glean the most important points and persons from that massive manuscript, and piece together the tragedy to give the most complete account possible (as was known at the time)."
4,The Ferriday Fireball Rockin' Up A Storm,"No mention of venue, recording date, or why the substandard sound. As a record store Manager/record collector fan once said to me (when it comes to classic artists) ""...you take what you can get"" and the takin' is plenty here with cookin' renditions of lesser-known JLL, i.e. ""Flip, Flop, and Fly"", ""Help Me Make It Through The Night"", and well-known JLL ""What'd I Say"", ""Chantilly Lace"" and ""Me And Bobby McGee"", the last two titles mentioned being his greatest versions yet! The low-fidelity concert transciption actually adds ""pop"" to the mix, which often is missing from ""proper"" live offerings.Ofcourse, there are other live Lee Lewis sets out there, you know, from Alabama, from Italy, from Germany, from all over. I haven't heard a better ""Bobby McGee"" than on this budget set."
1,AfterMarket item,"I ordered from the EZVacuum web site in order to get the original Hoover part. They show it, unlike this on Amazon, for almost $13 each, but pictured IN the Hoover packaging, so I paid the extra in order to know that I was getting an original part. Instead, they sent me 2 unpackaged filters, no markings or part numbers, and the back looks different from the Hoover filters. I called to complain and explained the very reason i ordered that particular filter was to get the packaged Hoover filter, not some aftermarket thing. They say they'll try to send me 2 that are in original packages, and that these are ones they get in a big box and just mail out. I have no assurance these that they sent me would work like they should, something I had a hard time explaining to the guy who answered the phone."
1,"Terrible, would not recommend.","My girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon. This is by visiondecor furniture. First it shows up on the curbside in pieces. Did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together? This is not including the cushions. The material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy. I don't know if it will last a year. IKEA furniture is actually better quality. Paid around $550 with shipping, if she would have spent another $200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in Los Angeles. She is very disappointed and wants to cry. Sad, very sad...."
5,***Echale' Kumbia Kings se la robaron con su segundo cd***,"WOW, This second recording is the best, not that I am impressed. I mean what do you spect? when you put AB Quintanilla to do music you will get the best, guarantee. I just bought this cd and I can't stop listening to it , the music is good , the lyrics are fantastic and the rythm is the best. So if you liked Amor Familia y Respeto WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, BUY IT, before they run out of copies. And for Ab Quintanilla y los Kumbia Kings PALANTE Guys this cd really rocks. You'll get your GRAMYSSS, because I bet you they will get more than one."
4,Worked well for 5 years,"I purchased this nearly 6 years ago and found its use intuitive (and easy to distinguish between the sleep function and the off function-- very important!) It has a small footprint and has been a good bedside companion. After 4 moves, it has now ended up in the kitchen. The new function apparently killed it.I began using it differently-- ie., changing the channel a few times a day. Once I began changing the channel, the volume seemed to collapse. Now, the volume wheel has ceased to work-- it makes different bursts of static. If you don't plan on changing the channel often, I recommend this. For 6 years it was an excellent product."
3,to big,"Country Life L-Lysine 1000 mg with B-6, 250-Count Sorry but the pills are too big for my trout.Pharmacy have to thing in all the senior customers. I will go for the 500mm"
1,Don't waste your cash!,"Though titillating, this book, like Starr's entire investigation, is a complete waste of money. First off, its just REALLY BAD, and second, you can read it for free in the paper or on the web"
2,"To the point, but written in such a legal way...","...it was really boooooring. The Starr report, I felt, dwelled too much on the details of the Clinton/Lewinsky affair than was needed. Alas, what should we expect? This is indeed what the people wanted. Never did I think they would release this, but imagine the money that will be made! Anyhow, this book was dry in content, no plot, no story, just facts. If you like that kind of thing, more power to you. Well, there it is, my very first review. I hope everyone else can dwell on it more. ;)BTC"
5,President Clinton's Perjury Costs Taxpayers Millions,"We can thank President Clinton for the cost of this report, but more importantly his perjury. It seems ignorance has overshadowed the fact that the President committed a crime; Mr. Clinton lied under oath. Comments regarding ""his private life"" are evidence to the fact that people don't understand the issue(s) at hand. Maybe those people should revisit Mr. Starr's report."
2,"Review? Or ""Soap Box"" time...","Could reviewers please do just that--""Review"" and not make this their personal forum for righteousness? The book was affordably priced, less time consuming to read than downloading and cheaper than producing on one's home printer. Other than that; no surprises."
5,Great Historic Document!,"Whether one relishes the many sorid details, Starr's narrative leaves little doubt that the Executive Branch has been soiled beyond the imagination of most Americans. Thanks to Clinton, this report might join the Mayflower Compact and Emancipation Proclamation as one of our nation's important historic documents. Darwin shrugs! But don't blame the messenger. Read this, and you'll see that Starr has merely done what Reno hired him to do. The Report is best read in book form (annotated internet versions are to hard to follow). Here's nonfiction at it's finest!"
3,"It's a filter, works I suppose, but it didn't actually fit my Holmes model.","I have a Holmes model, either HAP422 or HAP424 and the filters when they're in the slot, the cover doesn't fit and click. I had to tape the cover over the filter. Everything appears to still be working, but you shouldn't have to ghetto-rig something that claims to fit.Either that or my Holmes model is the issue."
3,Not exact fit for HAP240,"This is a quality filter at a good price. But, it does not fit my HAP240 unit as well as the OEM filter. I had to make a gasket out of cardboard to cover the gaps around the filter. That got it functional, but it has a slight whistle from air leaking through the remaining cracks. If you're not handy, it might be worth the extra money to get the OEM filters for a HAP240."
1,didn't fit,"I matched the model number and read reviews and despite all my searches, it was the wrong thing. I'll buy in a store next time."
5,The worlds best monkey,I have had my Bonsai since I was 9 and I am now 21. Since the 4th grade I've slept with this monkey and he has gone to every sleep over and overnight trip I've ever been on. When I was a competitive gymnast he travelled the country with me and gave me comfort and now as a college senior I keep him at school with me to help me sleep. He's been smashed in a duffel bag hundreds of times and I wash him almost every time I wash my sheets. My god daughter is about to turn two and I will be getting her a Bonsai for herself since every time I stay the night with her and her parents she obsesses over him even though mine is worn out and his fur has turned rough from the washer and dryer. I recommend this monkey to anyone who is looking for the perfect stuffed animal and I would be lost without mine.
3,Deep Black: PayBack (CD - Unabridged),"I bought this to listen to in the car while I drive, and I have not had a chance to listen to it yet. Therefore, I have no review of the book at this point and cannot give it an accurate rating."
5,Good entertainment,Powerpuff girls were well loved in my house years ago. The younger generation enjoys the shows just as much as their mother's did.
3,For Only A Select Group of Persons,"In her message to Comic-Con Jennifer Garner says they made this movie for the fans. They only wanted praise from a select group of persons, persons who grew up as fans of the Elektra comics.They reached their goal. Elektra fans will probably enjoy this flick. Others, like me, will be confused. The action is fast. The villians and costumes are quality. The viewer somewhat symphasizes with the characters. I just felt I was left as an outsider to the story line.If you are not an Elektra fan do not spend your money purchasing this film. If you rent it and are not a fan, you will profit by watching the special features BEFORE you watch the film. After watching the special features I wanted to watch the film again to see what I'd missed."
3,Could have been better.,"Well, I did not completely dislike this movie, but I feel this movie could have been better. As a big Marvel fan, I had some epxectations of what I wanted to see out of the Elektra movie. What we got is a B-movie like story but wiith a great actress Jennifer Garner. I like the fight scenes, but I wish the director kinda pulled more elements from the comics such as the Elektra Assasin story. Jennifer Garner is absolutely stunning in this movie. But even her acting could not save this movie. I still gave it an okay review due to the movie being Elektra. I hope in the future, a movie studio will reboot this character and give it a edgier and more mature story such as her Assasin story. I am sure most fans from the Daredevil movie will watch this. Unfortunately, I was disappointed at how this story and movie turned out."
2,What a MISS !!!!!!,"What a shame what a miss,The special effects were mildy entertaining, the fight scenes lacking, in addition they tried to make Jennifer into a dark moody/broody kick butt woman. Sorry Jennifer you did not pull it off. DEARDEVIL was ok but this was LESS than OK.A definite let down in the ""comic book to movie"" category."
3,Elektra,"Was not bad but not one of my favorites. Somehow, female heroines do not come across as well as the males and I am not going against feminism...just facts."
2,"Director's Cut, just as bad as the Regular Cut","I was hoping for more with the ""Director's Cut"" then just commentary and extra scenes. the Daredevil ""Director's Cut"" was 30 minutes longer and the changes , back to the directors original, made the movie better. as for Elektra, it just didn't do that well as a spin-off.The director makes the action scenes unexciting and just a collection of poor CGI, meanwhile using music in a hamfisted attempt to make the audience have any emotional attachment with the product. Even die-hard Garner fans will struggle to enjoy this dog....."
2,Climax problems,"Pretty good atmosphere, and I like Jennifer Garner, so I liked it - to a point. Unfortunately, the point I stopped liking it was the climax. Since I don't want to be a spoiler, I won't say more."
4,Elektra,"I saw this at the theater and just watched it on DVD. Very good movie, I am a fan of Jen Garner, she really worked hard to do this movie, and her fight scenes were incredible. Recommend."
4,Elektra,"This was one of the good movies out there. With decent scenes with nice special effects, and Jennifer does really good in the movie. So if I were you go see this movie as soon as possible."
2,Oh why Jennifer Garner.,"Being a big fan of Alias, I love Jennifer Garner. Daredevil wasn't a great movie but I found that Jen was really beautiful and cool in it. So, I was pretty excited to see her star in Elektra. But what can I say? The story is...ahhh, so cheesy and so bad. The acting...the everything! Nothing is great. The only thing that can pull the movie through is looking at Jennifer Garner! But how long can you do that and be entertained? Also, that would have been easier to do if her costume wasn't that ugly. Lots of people wanted the traditional costume back that wasn't seen in Daredevil but it didn't look good! Sigh. No comment."
1,NHT Subone,"I ordered this subwoofer a couple of weeks ago out of a catalog and it shipped to my house in a couple of days.I got it out and plugged it in to my 300 watt sony stereo and it didnt work.I got an exchange fo a new one plugged it in, it worked fine, untill the next day when it blew. I got my money back and ordered the Sony SA-W305 which I still have. Its the best."
5,Cowboys and Indians,"Got this for my grandson to go with the Express Stagecoach set. He is very pleased with this. He's a big Playmobil fan. The package came promptly during the Holidays. Good product, good service."
3,The third volume in the humorous SF series for children.,"In this third book of the Norby series, Space Cadet Jeff and his robot Norby locate a planet populated by humans who had been transplanted from Earth millennia ago. They rescue a young princess trapped on another planet who has been changed into a plant. The next book in the series is ""Norby and the Invaders."" The two books were later reissued together as ""Norby: Robot for Hire."""
5,Sea life nerd's tidepool bible,"I got this book as a kid in 1985 on a weeks-long family road trip that included stops along the Oregon and northern California coast. I still have it today. To be perfectly honest, I haven't looked at it in over 10 years, but my memories of it are that it's descriptive and useful in identifying tidepool creatures found along the Pacific coast. At the time, I was a little sea life nerd, into collecting shells, among other things, so I friggin' loved this book. It's small in size, too, which makes it handy to take along when you're actually navigating tidepool rocks."
5,"Awesome speaker, but a warranty would be nice",NHT only honors the 5 year warranty on these speakers if purchased through an authorized dealer. Amazon.com is NOT authorized. The only .com authorized to sell these with a warranty is Crutchfield.comJust a warning to all of you out there.
3,Very interesting reading,"This book contains many truths, but there are many things that I can not agree with, one being his undying belief in reincarnation. I noticed a few times he mentions ""The"" Christ, instead of just Christ. I would have loved some reference as to where he was getting his material. I know that most of his information was suppose to be from the Angels that visited him, but foot notes would have been nice for at least some of the material. I wish I could just accept his angel story and take what he says as a message from God, I really do. It is just hard to do with so many people claiming to get information from angels, and the reincarnation thing contradicts what I understand the Bible to say. I still say this is a very good reading book!"
4,The Donna Reed Show Second Season on DVD Comment,"I bought the second season of the Donna Reed show because when the series was first brought back by Nick at Nite in the late 80s I was immediately hooked. What a sweet simple show with believable characters portrayed by great actors old and young. My only gripe about the second season is the packaging. I love the principle stars' faces on the discs, but why a clam box? The first season packaging was perfect. However, I will buy the rest of the seasons even if they come in a crumpled paper bag."
2,Feromonas,I have tried it several time and I have no result. I'm still waiting because I know that one day might work
3,Only the skeleton of a vast organism,"If you're not already familiar with this era of English history, Burnet's book will be hard to follow. Important characters (so familiar to those times) enter our stage without introduction, and after dropping famous hints, or carrying off some great exploit, are discarded without subsequent investigation. In short, Burnet touches lightly on the events and main players of each year from 1660-1712, but scarcely troubles himself to round out his topics, or give life to his characters. As he himself says, he only writes on areas where he was a key witness, but doesn't enlarge on events which most likely would appear in other history books.After reading Hume or Macaulay, Burnet's writings seem almost useless. An important figure of the times, it is difficult to conceive how this volume figures as an important journal of the times, yet for its defense, we are told that Swift owned a copy."
2,There seems to be a lack of understanding here.,"Obviously very few of the previous people reviewing this book have actually read this book cover to cover. I have and I can tell you Rockford keeps repeating the same concepts over and over and over, what a bore. Many of his examples are not the best solution to creating business objects. Don't be fooled just because this is a Wrox press book that it is automatically a great programming book. It is the author that writes the book, not Wrox press and the book is only as good as the author. This book is not total garbage, it does contain some good concepts, just beware that it is this man's opinion as to how he thinks business objects should be developed."
2,not what I expected,"A metronome is known to make a clicking sound which is what it is generally purchased for. This one, however, makes a chirping sound in two different notes which distracts me from the notes I am playing. There was nothing in the product discription informing the buyer of this. I bought it because of the brand name which I have used before and was different from this model."
1,Cheap.,"The beat of this metronome is irritatingly loud, to the point where it distracts from the music you're trying to play. The LED display bouncing-ball pulse is muddy and difficult to tell when it's trying to beat. There's no volume control, only a mute button. It looks like it has a dial for bpm-adjustment (an extremely desirable feature) but it doesn't.There is no power switch, resulting in terrible battery life.A complete waste of money.For a budget metronome, I suggest you check out the Korg MA-30, or if you want the dial (and can live without volume control) then the Matrix MR500 or Seiko SQ50 is a good choice."
4,Their 1st Feature Film thats All Theirs.,"Pardon us was Stan & Ollie's 1st feature that was all their own. They run in to Walter Long [one of their best nemesis.]in prison.They ended up there due to Stan trying to sell home made beer during prohibition to a police officer who Stan thought was a street car conductor.Stan also has a loose tooth that makes a rasberry sound when he talks. They are an unlikely pair to be in the big house and they escape but not for long,if you are a Laurel & Hardy fan you love to add this to your collection"
2,let us (please) never speak of it (or play it) again,"Out hud. their last album was killer. i mean s.t.r.e.e.t d.a.d was a great album and this one fails to live up to it. what made the last one great was the inclusion of a violin/cello in a good majority of the tracks. the guitar work was great too. what killls this one is the inclusion of (not too great) vocals by phyillis forbes and molly schnick. what it is is that vocals just dont work with their style and in my opinion if the vocals arent good, just dont include them. if they would get molly to stop singing and play a little more cello, and phyllis to stop whining and play a little piano, i think they would have another great one. in all, they should try and bring back the style of their last album, with more guitar echo, violin, and a pumping rhythm line that you can bob your head to."
4,Very good,"The quality of the uniform is very good. The elastic waistband in the pants are a little tighter than I'd prefer (thick too, ~1.5"", which seems unnecessary), but overall, great product. Another note, I personally get very hot when working out, and this gi material is tightly woven. It was like an oven inside! That's probably just me though."
2,No Color Choice,"Since my search was for ""yellow Sanford Liquid Accent Highlighters"" I did not realize I did not have a color choice. Therefore it cost me the shipping and the time and trouble because I received PURPLE! They have NO YELLOW!Otherwise, the service has been more than satisfactory."
1,"Entirely too many big words, couldn't put dictionary down!","It may be a great book to some, but even with my average intelligence I couldn't follow a page without grabbing a dictionary in hopes I could stick with the story."
4,Carl Hiaasen Takes on the Mouse,"In this essay-style book, Hiaasen takes on Disney and all its decadence from the point of view of a true Floridian. Very funny and full of disturbing Disney facts (including one about the mysterious torture and death of an Animal Kingdom rhino; ties between Disney and the destruction caused by Hurricane Andrew; and all the yucky deals made between the rat and the state of FL's government). Good read, highly entertaining for Floridians, tourists, and anyone who loves Hiaasen."
1,Book is not an expose on how Disney is mis-shaping character,"I was disappointed in the book because, with the many examples of poor character that we are given by the child-actors in many Disney movies, there could have been something said about the misplaced trust that parents have in Disney to entertain (educate?, indoctriate?, spoil?, misdirect?nurture? admonish?) their children... Hiassen does not share any of our concerns about our children's character, but instead says that if he had to choose between Disney's greed (which he hates, and which he has written the book about) and between moralists, he would side with the greedy Disney company every time! I hope someone will write us a book that will really shake our faith in the Mouse-idol!"
1,Short short short whining story with little humor,This was the shortest book I have ever read 83 pages of 14 font double spaced words on 5 by 7 pages with 1 inch margins what a profit for someone. I was hoping for an insightful analysis into the workings and deviant behavior of Disney not just some guy's biased opinions of a huge money making machine. We already know that so how about some facts.
2,You can't always bat a thousand,"It's abundantly clear that Mr. Hiaasen doesn't go to bed at night with a Mickey Mouse hat on his head and a Donald Duck plush toy under his arm. You would think that Disney's strong-arm tactics in building and operating their amusement parks in Florida is fertile ground for a hard-hitting expose. Unfortunately, this isn't that book. I have enjoyed all of Mr. Hiaasen's other stories, including his collections of newspaper columns. For some reason Team Rodent was a disappointment. Too short. Too lame. Too bad."
4,"mickey mouse, skewered and smoked","Only Hiaasen could turn Disney into the vile and soulless entity presented in ""Team Rodent"" and still make you chuckle. I suspect that most lucid people have had the occasional flickering thought that perhaps the Disney Corporation seemed a bit too omnipresent and omnipotent to be so wonderful, and here Hiaasen explains exactly why that is the case. To be fair, this book isn't just a roasting of the mouse, it is also a roasting of the American culture that so embraces the overcleansed Disney ideal. Hiaasen's writing, as usual, is witty and clever, and sometimes snort-milk-out-your-nose funny. Humor aside, I found the book deeply troubling because I saw so many parallels between the way that Disney and Big Tobacco run their businesses and buy off their enemies. This book will certainly make you laugh, but hopefully it will also make you think."
2,lack of research,this book was flawed from the trashy movie coversto the insane clown posse this man clearly did notdo his research.I mean draw the wash. mon.then tell me what it looks like to a pervand the insane clown posse had a large number of fansbefore ever going to h-wood records.tho entertaining this book lacks hardcore facts.
1,Biased opinion of Disney,"The stAte's that he want be banned from Disney, though he has not visited Disney since 1986' It is apparent that he has deep hatred and is trying to turn others against the company. His book is not worth publishing."
2,fiction says it better,"I have long been a fan of Carl Hiaassen's fiction, and his satire of Disney World in ""Native Tongue"" was far more effective in making his point than this 87-page elongated essay. I found the book disappointing and felt that he did not make a good case at all for something he obviously feels strongly about. He presents the reader with a lot more emotion than facts, picking out 5 or 6 incidents, some of which he admits that Disney was in no way at fault in. It boils down to a few perhaps unethical and undesirable things that just about any big corporation, not only Disney, has probably been guilty of. I'm not a big Disney fan, by the way. What I see as dangerous is any company's taking control of so much of the media that their views and values can be imposed on society whether we want them or not. I don't think this was adequately addressed at all. Stick to fiction, Carl, you're much better at it."
2,A book not worthy of Carl's talent....,"As an avid reader of Carl Hiaasen's articles and novels, this work is simply not in the same class. The tone is snippy without being enlightening. The evidence presented in the book, although most likely accurate, is largely unsupported and undocumented. It is book that attempts to be both humor and documentary and fails on both accounts and reads like it was written in a weekend..."
5,label,"These are best cookie sheets we use. In response to the person who had difficulty removing the label, I to become pretty irritated at this but try some Goo Gone; works like a charm."
2,The Series Drags On . . .,"Like a lot of Card's recent series installments, this book drags without any real point. The characters are sort of drifting towards an eventual destination, but Heartfire is a mess, without most of the elements that normally distinguish Card's work.The plot: Alvin goes on trial, again; Calvin gets in trouble, again; and everyone has long conversation about what interesting characters they are. Alvin decides that the Crystal City should have fair laws. Alvin's trial and Calvin's goofing around each turn out ok, and Alvin picks up some more disciples.Back in the good old days, Orson Scott Card novels were full of original premises, difficult moral dilemmas, and were gripping the whole way through. Recently, _Pastwatch_ met all these criteria, and was well worth 5 stars. On the other hand, _Heartfire_ feels like it is just marking time until 1846, when Alvin will presumably lead his people West. At this rate, it looks like a long, boring wait."
4,Back to what Card does best,Thank you unlce Orson for getting back to what you know how to do the best - create worlds and atmosphere unlike what we live in and fill it with larger than life characters. This is a wonderful book with the language of Hatrack river and sharp insight into a variety of human issues.
2,Not a 400 mhz bus speed,"The bus speed is 333 on this board. I was misled and purchased one. I was planning to put a 3200+ processor in it, but now I am limited to a 3000+. I am very disappointed with the way this board was represented. False advertising."
2,Not as Advertised,"This tape is not ""white"" as it appears in the photo, or ""cream"" either as listed in the text--it's just tan drafting tape of the same color as standard masking tape. Maybe not a problem for some buyers, but I needed white drafting tape, and this isn't it. Incidentally, it's 19mm width, not 18mm as advertised. I think this is a substitute product for what's in the ad."
5,"Great Quality, Easy Install","Good, solid passage lever. I have converted our whole house to this series of passage levers and locksets (including dead bolts). Highly recommended."
1,No track Roller Included!,"I understand that I should have read the tiny print more carefully, but, the way the toy is packaged makes it seem as if there is a track roller included. Not just in the picture, but the package itself has a boxy area that the train sits on, just the right size for the roller. You can't even purchase the track roller unless you buy a whole set of accessories for $50. I am both disappointed and angry about this purchase. Previously, I had been impressed with Spinmaster's products. I will not buy from themn again becuase I feel that I was mislead."
4,Nighty,"This item came in a timely manner and I was satisfied with the item as well, the only con is that the shipper used the postal service instead of UPS on the shipping"
4,Solid perfomance - 3.5 stars for sure.,"Wow, ""I'm Totally Not Down With Rob's Alien"" is an awesome, complex tune that I'm afraid has imbedded itself firmly inside my head. Really, the only beef I have with Minus the Bear is that the lead singer's voice creeps into that emo-pop vocal sound that sometimes gives me a bit of a headache.Otherwise, the guitars and drums work together in this perfect cacophany of musical bliss. This is music that demands to be listened to thoughtfully. At the same time, it's a treat for the ears. I think my I.Q. actually went up a couple points."
5,Completing my education,"The book combines humor and well written text to cover material that either we should have learned or perhaps it was taught on those days that we skipped classes. Not just a mere book of facts, the author relates the material in a manner that allows the reader to understand not only the significance of the material covered, but a greater appreciation for learning in the details. It's extremely easy to read and very difficult to put down. Clearly a must for any library and useful for cultivating greater curiosity."
4,"Useful, in quite an unexpected way","I found this book to be entirely unlike what I expected. I was hoping for a book that gives snippets of information that adults could use in everyday life but are missing, regarding issues such as grammar, etiquette, law, and so forth. That is not what this book deals with.Laid forth are the histories of various fields, with respect to the creators, movers, and shakers of the classics and masterpieces. While there is some trivia as such, what you learn from this book is not only how things such as economics, popular music, literature, etc., got started, but the major courses they traversed, i.e., WHY THINGS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE TODAY.This book won't give you much to boast about at a cocktail party, but will give you an overall understanding of the state of the arts, politics, and the rest of the world in general, which may be of more use than what I had intended on buying in the first place."
4,Astronaut strawberries,"Well, this is pretty good. It might take you while to get used to it, but i tastes really good. Same goes for the neapolitan astronaut ice cream! YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY IT!"
5,"romantic without being dirty, spiritual,intriguing,fascinati","Eugenia Price is a very spiritual writer with a lotof love to go around.I've read everything I can get by her and even went to her island about 4 years ago and toured around the island right down to the cemeteries where some of the characters were buried.A very fascinating book, as are all her books."
1,Did not work consistently,"I bought this to back up key data files on 3 computers, 2 are Win 2000 and one is a Win 98SE machine. At first the unit would not power up, either the AC adapter was faulty or the internal plug connection was lose. Tech support was very knowledable and helpful. They sent me a new adapter and I had power although sometimes I had to jiggle the plug at the hard drive end. I never was able to get it to work on all three machines, it worked on one Win 2000 and the Win 98SE machine. Even on these 2 machines it did not work all the time, it seemed very moody. I returned it before my time was up for returns.Next I bought a Kanguru Quicksilver and I am much happier with it. It has easier to use set up software and it is working well on all 3 machines."
2,Not Particularly Useful,"I've used this video several times and am sending it to Goodwill. Calling it ""yoga"" at all is a bit of a stretch (ahem). It's mostly a series of yoga-ish poses and stretches, none of which are particularly vigorous and yet managed to increase, rather than decrease, my upper back pain. I would recommend this only for seriously infirm people, and even then I'm not sure about it, since in many cases it appeared to inflame and irritate my scapular muscles. I've been dealing with my back pain in various ways for years, and this hasn't helped me."
4,I felt a difference the first time I did it,"I have been meaning to get to this, but today my necks was so tight and stiff, causing a headache, I finally made the time. I felt some relief after just one of the thirty minute segments - I wil definitely keep this up."
1,Viniyoga Therapy-All DVD's defective-BEWARE,"We ordered the Viniyoga Therapy for Upper Back and for Lower Back. They just came out with a re-released version at the beginning of August. All of them (we returned and got new defective set) did not work on any of our DVD players, including our neighbors. Make sure they burn new DVD's before ordering this product. I've heard it's an awesome workout for people with injuries and I hope they make new ones soon!"
3,Stretches not that great and....,"In the segment I watched, the lady was out of shape and wrinkly.As for the stretches, they are just beginner yoga stretches; there is nothing special about these stretches.Update: I finally found a great shoulder DVD.Yoga Link: Shoulder Shape-Up with Jill Miller"
1,not impressive,"Nothing special here. Just your standard sugar pop songs. Been done before except with better vocals & mix. Sound is immature, might sound good after they play together more."
2,Design flaw impedes performance,"The unit is good-looking and sturdy, although larger than I expected. The motor is powerful and the reamer design is extremely effective getting out all the juice. However, there is a problem over which I am returning mine. The larger ""orange"" reamer does not replace the smaller ""lemon"" size, but nests on top of it. That gives one more item (beside the bowl and stainless-steel filter) that has to be washed. More seriously, that puts one more item (a total of four) between the orange and the motor. So, if anything gets at all out of alignment (such as if a piece of pulp gets between two parts, or things just tilt a bit) pressing on the orange half may not engage the switch that starts the motor. The result is extremely frustrating--maybe juice, maybe nothing, maybe just a hum. Too bad."
4,cool,"but not a must buy. If you already have Coast to Coast, buying the import isnt a necessity. Don't get me wrong i do enjoy the cd and everything. The extra songs are cool as well ""Close Your Eyes"", ""nothing is impossible"" and the new recordings of ""My Girl"", ""I'll Be There"" and ""Uptown Girl"".But it isn't necessary to buy unless your a hardcore Westlife fan and want to have everything cd that they've released since first coming out."
5,Great!!,I had already seen it when it came out. I like the whole cast. The movie is a good balance between history and legend.
4,"on the whole a great package, but ...","... i've two quibbles.i feel that the quality of the recording is inferior to the other great compilation - the very best of cream.also there are two versions of ""NSU"", ""sunshine of your love"" and ""i'm so glad"" here - studio and live.for this they could have included the two tracks : lawdy mama and steppin out."
1,Not what I envisioned,"These plates were packaged appropriately and sent in a timely manner. Once they arrived, they appeared much larger than I had envisioned. From the website, these 12"" plates were recommended to fit an 8"" opening. Unless you want your house looking like an industrial park, pay a little more and find something that fits appropriately. Upon mailing these back, I was told that each and every one of the plates was dented. Odd, considering I didn't take any of them out of the packaging. The compay was quick to respond to emails until I asked for photographs of the damage. Although I had initially planned to return these monsters and replace with more appropriately sized speakers from the same company, their unwillingness to offer even partial credit towards a new purchase has soured me on their customer-focus. I will be buying additional covers today, but from a different comany."
4,Excelent sound,"Excelent sound from my pioneer speakers, The VMax feature is a waste, love the A/V interface."
5,Great Condition and Love the Book,"I bought this book used - like good. The book's condition was great!I would highly recommend getting this book for class or independent learning. The chapters are quick, to-the-point, and easy to understand; plus, the problems follow directly after each chapter and provide excellent feedback for one's understanding."
4,Worthwhile,"Robinson's selection is a worthwhile look through some extremely diverse views on the existence and character of God, as well as selections of thoughts from various thinkers throughout the ages. Authors as diverse as Aquinas and Nietszche make the grade, as well as the less well known but equally thought provoking. If you're into philosophy, theology, or just want to have your thinking challenged, this is a worthwhile read."
4,LOL...,"Hahahahahaha... 3.5 stars... funny as hell!!! Way better than A.I. you know what I mean, though not a fan of G.D. (dont believe it? Nvm, I owned all their albums but I can't sit through them all, still some of them untouched for years, DUH!!!)This one is much much funnier!!! I enjoy it very much, every ounce of it, it remains me of... well, enjoy!!!"
3,The book puts an awkward foot forward,"Although this book discusses many important aspects of Russian culture, I felt that it focused a bit too much on bussines. Many of us, like myself, would be visiting Russia not for bussines, rather as tourists. However, some of her remarks did offer some excelent advice about greeting people, eating, and Russian manners. Most topics though seemed a bit too glazed over. I wished that the author would have further discussed many points in her book. Overall, it's a good book to start with. Read it and you will find a taste of what Russian manners are like. Although I would strongly recomend doing further research. Try to find a book that is more current. This book was first published in 1995, many aspects of Russian culture have changed since then."
2,So-so,"This was an improbable spy novel with a thin, convoluted story line and no likable characters. Hannah Gray is on the run using a friend's Venice vacation tickets (and a fake passport that Hannah made on her home computer no less) because she found the medical insurance fraud committed by her lover and she failed to report him because of the affair they were having so he ratted her out instead and now the Feds are after her while the wife of a brilliant government scientist she met while traveling accidentally gave her a secret formula for creating black holes so now government-hired assassins (including one who is in his 30s but looks like he's 12) are after her, too, but she tricks them and they all die and she gets away. The book was twice as long as it needed to be."
5,something you'd only hear in space,"this cd is absolutely gorgeous and terribly underrated. i guess the music alone could be compared to the likes of mogwai, explosions in the sky, godspeed you black emperor, etc. but the vocals are what really catch you, and sweep you in. his voice sounds dreamy and uncertain but honest. the lyrics are moody and fragile. it's a stargazing soundtrack by definition."
5,adorable,My girls adore this book. We read it all the time. They are fans of The Night Before Christmas so this was the perfect book for Valentine's Day
4,Works.,"I put two of these under my tongue on nights when my legs feel restless or crampy. (I think my restless legs have to do with fluid retention, like right before menstration or when I've had a salty dinner.) Anyway, this works to calm restless legs - and pretty much instantly! However, about the 7th or 8th time I used it, I felt tingling in one of my feet that I also felt again the next morning. Not sure if this product caused it - but I can't think of anything else that would have, as it started as soon as I took it. Not sure if I'm going to use this product again"
5,Families and History,We read the Caldecott Award Book for Health. We were studying families. This is a great book that is easily understood by lower elementary grades. It is about how 3 generations relate to each other. It could be used to study family or American history. A very good book I would recommend for grades 2nd and below.
3,"Poor overall quality, but it is what it is...","I wasn't expecting anything fantastic, but I still have to say that this shirt is NOT worth the price. Printing job on it looks ok but definitely not done well, and the second you have this shirt in your hands you can tell it's cheap as sh_t. For a joke shirt, though, it does the job. It is not soft, so I wore it over a long sleeve shirt so I didn't have to get reconstructive nipple surgery later. On the plus side, if you'd like to exfoliate your torso throughout the day, wear this shirt."
1,Don't be fooled - not spill-proof,My friend had purchased spill proof bubbles which sounded much like these. I was very disappointed that these are just bubbles in a squeezy container. When you have two 2.5 year olds that means a hand and lap full of bubble liquid. I wouldn't recommend these until the kids are old enough to understand that over-squeezing means bubble solution everywhere. Not really what I thought I was buying.
3,Ehh...,"I bought this after trying a couple other bubble thing-a-ma-jigs. I was looking for a bubble blower where you could put the solution inside (b/c kid was 3 and spilled it) but also one that didn't need batteries. This seems oddly designed in that the whole bear gets filled with solution but the blower piece only drops down into the top 2 inches. So you have to keep it filled to the brim for it to work which means even tipping it makes spills. If they made it so the bubble piece dropped down in the belly it would be great, i think its an adorable little bear."
3,"Nice, but hard to use","I like the idea of this bubble blower, but I find it hard to use if the container is not completely full of bubble solution. Once you've used it a little bit, it's difficult to get enough solution on the wand. You have to blow a certain way to get the bubbles to come out too. Overall, the quality is just okay.*Update: I found that if you shake up the bear before you use it, it is easier to get bubble solution on the wand for a series of bubble blowing. I imagine this will get harder as the bubble solution gets used up, but time will tell!"
2,too much cholesterol,It's inexpensive and tastes OK BUT I stopped buying this for my son because of the high cholesterol level in it. There are other perfectly good options with much less and I found an isolate with none. He uses several scoops each day so it adds up.
4,Good taste but..,"The EAS 100% Whey Chocolate flavor protein supplement tastes like chocolate milk when you mix regular or soy milk in it. The powder mixes well if you have milk in the cup before adding the powder. However, despite the good taste, I usually get minor stomach aches after consuming this drink because of the Splenda (a.k.a artificial flavoring) in the ingredient used to make this whey powder, so be careful. I would advise new buyers to purchase the smaller 12.5 oz jar (12 - 18$)to see how their body would react to this product before buying the 5 lb + bag/jar. The taste is great but the ingredients used to accommodate EAS' product taste is also something else you should keep in mind.-- Good luck"
3,not the product in the picture,"I purchased this hoping to receive the item in the picture, but it is a different formula with completely different amounts of protein, carbs & sugars. It has 26g protein, 7 carbs, 2 sugars & is 150 calories. The picture & description need to be corrected."
5,EAS Protein,"For the money, you can't beat EAS Whey. The vanilla mixes in really well with berries and bananas and if you get to the blender quickly it's not a bad clean-up. Overall, an affordable, affective and good tasting whey."
1,Item Never Received,"This review is directed toward the vendor, Vitamin Grocer. I would imagine the product is fine, but I can't say since I never received it. Originally, the order was lost in transit and customer service claimed to resend another. Two weeks later it still never arrived. After a month passed from my original order i opted for a refund instead."
3,Decent Whey Protein Powder,"This chocolate Whey Protein product is good; it does the job of getting your protein (naturally), but other than that, it lacks. It says it mixes well, but most definitely does not -- I used to stir my protein shakes and this was never a problem with my old EAS vanilla one. However, with this one, it just doesn't really dissolve into the water and is super chunky. Now, I have a blender to do it and it definitely does the job.Another thing that gets to me is how strong the chocolate flavor is in the powder. Usually, when I workout, I put two servings into a cup and when I don't lift weights and simply do cardio, I put one serving. Because of the concentration, this makes putting two servings unbearable as it's super bitter and strong. I found this surprising as the vanilla version of EAS was fine."
3,Good but frustrating.,First I will say that I do enjoy soccer games. I am not a huge sports fan but for some reason that I am unable to explain I enjoy watching and playing soccer games. I found that the graphics for the game were good and the sounds were not too bad either but the animations did get repetitive after playing through about half of the tournament. I also found it very difficult to get off the striker kick without it being interrupted. I found that once you beat the first tournament the AI suddenly became extremely difficult to the point of swearing and finally giving up completely on the game. I have not played it in probably about 6+ months and I might just sell it. I highly recommend that you rent this game before buying it and play for a while.
2,"Game is fun, only one big problem though","I like it, but if you're going through the Cup Mode. Forget it! You won't reach the Striker Cup. The highest difficulty level makes it virtually unplayable. The only way you would even reach the ""Cup Round"" is if you pulled something outta your *** or you had a Game Genie of some sort."
4,I like it!,It is fun and people still play on line. It can get really hard with some of the better players but that just makes me want to play more.
5,WHAT A SEQUEL!!!!!!,"With the big popularity of Super Mario Strikers, Nintendo once again teamed up with Next Level Games to produce a sequel for Wii. The sixthMario Sports game is actually better than it's predecessor.You can play as one of 12 team captains (Mario, Peach, Donkey Kong, Waluigi, Luigi, Wario, Bowser, Yoshi, Daisy, Bowser Jr., Diddy Kong, & Petey Piranha). The final three captains that I mentioned have to be unlocked. And you can also choose three of eight sidekicks (Koopa, Toad, Dry Bones, Boo, Birdo, Hammer Bro, Monty Mole, & Shy Guy).There are new stadiums plus the classic ones return in new fashion. I highly recommend this game to fans of the original plus those who love supercharged sports!"
4,Very Fun,This is a great Mario game. The power ups in the game make it very interesting and it is very fun to play with friends. There are also tons of challenges by going into tournament mode to unlock more players. You would only not like this game if you didn't like soccer but other than that this is a great buy.
4,A Great Component,"This MD player is made by SONY, the orginator of the MD. Although I use an AIWA for MD on the road this is a great MD component, for the money. Face it. You don't want to spend $400+ for a MD Player/Recorder for just some extra belles and whistles. This is the best choice if you're not a Audio Pro."
5,Superb compilation,"I love this album. If you want to relax buy Cafe Mambo - one of the best chillout compilations, that I ever heard."
4,Great Judo Guide,"One of the better judo/martial arts books I have purchased in the past several years. Good photographic illustrations, some advanced counters/techniques, and a lot of useful content from a family of Japanese-Canadians that have clearly lived Judo, as well as practiced it."
3,Good for a basic understanding,Good.. Could have used more illustrations to show both sides of the body to see what the other hand and foot is doing during the throws
1,A piece of poorly written garbage!,"This book is very poorly written. I suspect the authors are either morons or simply wrote this book with the intention to confuse readers as much as possible!Dynamics is a very important course in engineering, and it is crucial to not get confused about its concepts in your early career which is why you should not use this book.As also pointed out by others this book is just a piece of garbage from hell.DO NOT buy it. You have been warned.CAVEAT EMPTOR"
2,Mixed feelings,"What can I say. It keeps your coal contained but it usually not hot enough for my taste and you get flareups real close to your food. If you get the matchlight type charcoal, you can't cook anything until the fire is gone because your grilliput sits too close to the charcoal. That also limits how much charcoal you can put on. I do like the idea of keeping the charcoal contained. Its OK for backpacking and keeping things small but if you are gonna do that, why would you pack charcoal? Or if you are gonna use wood fuel, why not just put the grilliput over the fire on the ground instead of using this bowl. Also the circular bowl means the 4 edges of your grilliput doesn't get heat so you have to put your food in a circular fashion further limiting your cooking area. Its a nice idea though."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"This book is a complete waste of anyones time, trust me. The person who wrote this book must have written the other reviews himself, or had his students do it for extra credit. If this is the first book you read as an aspiring screenwriter you might find in a little interesting, but there really is nothing to this book but the very basics of screenwriting drawn out into 200+ page book. This books is so overwritten. Every point that could have been made in this book could have been made into a bulleted list and been 5 pages long.If you want to be a screenwriter this book will teach you absolutely nothing. Find another book to read, go online and read screenplays and learn from them instead!"
1,Skip it,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was how cheaply made it was like a plastic toy. No instructions were included, but it seemed easy enough. After inserting the (not included) AA battery, the trimmer would not turn on. Tried several batteries with no effect. Reversed the battery and still no effect. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Is your resume ready for the world?,"As a Host of the Employability and Career Planning sites, and an Interactive Resume workshop ... I like to have all kinds of Resume books and examples to refer to. No two resumes should be the same--this book gives great ideas on how to make YOUR experience stand out, not only in its wording, but also in the visual appeal.The onlydrawback I found is that some of the sample resumes are a bit simplistic and if taken at face value, people may try to keep it so short that they don't consider all their skills. Remember, your resume is the first step to selling yourself.Valuable reference to have around."
3,esperaba un poco mas,"para ser el primer libro relacionado con la homosexualidad, pense que podia aclararme mas preguntas que las ""tipicas"" 100 que se puede hacer cualquier persona que todavia duda de su sexualidad o de salir del ""closet.""lo lei muy rapido, y me dejo con algunas dudas, pero si estas pensando en ayudar a algun amigo/a a sentirse mejor consigo mismo, creo que es recomendable, o quizas hasta para los padres de alguien. es muy facil de entenderlo y muy claro."
2,not what's pictured - not compressed and not bone shaped,"The product I got was not what was pictured, and when I double checked the description, I realized that that was confusing as well.What I got was rolls of rawhide in a simple, straight stick shape. It also was not ""compressed"" like the type of bones pictured are. I wanted my dog to not be able to tear off pieces like is so easy to do with the loosely rolled knot bones. When she chewed down on this for a while and got to the inner layers, the inner layers just fell apart, leaving us with lots of small strips of rawhide, which I was afraid could easily be choked on.Bottom line: it's not compressed and it's not bone shaped, so I think the picture and description is misleading, and it was not what I was looking for."
1,Songs from Phil Collins,"No imagination and no creativity makes Live a dull band these days. Boring lyrics and boring guitar work make this record unlistenable. This is actually worse than V, which is incredibly bad. I will always be grateful for the great songs(""Lakini's Juice"", ""White, Discussion"", ""Waitress"", ""Gas Hed Goes West"", ""Beauty of Grey"") and great albums(Throwing Copper, Secret Samadhi, MJ, Distance)but I'm convinced Live's creative juices have run out. Giving this record more than 1 star just wouldn't be accurate. It happened to the Stones after Tattoo You and to U2 after Achtung Baby, so I guess it's normal to ""lose it"". Nevertheless, these guys put on a great show and hopefully I'll get to see them again soon."
3,"Good, but not compared to their old material","Good, but not compared to their old material. Their music will never be like the early 90's material."
2,No energy or creative left?,"I love Live's work up untill and including ""V"" but Birds of Prey was bland and now Songs from a Black Mountain picks up were Birds of Prey left off, with no creativity or energy in the songs. Live needs a shake up, it hurts to see this once great band put out such bland music without losing any band members or anything, what happened?"
3,songs from black mountain,"the problem in the world of music is ,the people live in the past. always remember the past albums of the groups.here with songs from black mountain we have a good cd. with songs that are direct to the positive way. simple as that . the fans talk about past albums but in the past albums like throwing cooper the song that was a hit all over you is repetitive.pardon my english i'm from puerto rico.but nobody cares cause the song was a hit . stop whinin and enyoy the cd. if you people don't like it so don't hear it .and stop livin in the past and enjoy new music that is good. by the way birds of pray is a good cd.you people don't know anything about positive lirycs."
1,Can't believe this is the same band that recorded Secret Samadhi,"I'm a completist, and despite warning from knowledgeable critics, I spent $4 on a used copy of this CD. Even at that price, this album is not a bargain. It's like a vapid power ballad producer got ahold of LIVE and put canned material in front of them. There isn't so much as an interesting riff on the album. It's swishy lyrics backed with cookie cutter power ballad music in the verse/chorus/verse/chorus/chorus vein."
2,What a disappointment!,"I have been a fan of Live since Throwing Copper, and so far loved all but one other cd. Don't buy this album if you expect it to rock like any of their previous albums. It doesn't. I couldn't even make it through the second song and I like all types of music. Wow. I read another review where they hope Live will make another heavy dark album...me too. Although, I sorely doubt it."
1,black indeed,"how can one band go from Throwing Copper, one of the greatest albums ever, to this, the massive decline in quality is of epic proportions. so what if you have found a god to call your own, he's bringing you down."
3,"Decent, but not great","I just barely went out and bought this album after hearing so many good things about it, and it was decent: but, definitely not as good as ""As The World Burns."""
1,BEWARE,"""Oyl Can Harry's"" was my first Ahmad Jamal purchase almost 30 years ago; I still have that vinyl, and it started a lifelong love for his music. The best thing in""Harris"" is a very unusual Jamal solo: his introduction to ""Folklore""; first alone, and then as a duet with bassist John Heard. Unusual as it is, it is absolutely unique in his recorded output. Unfortunately, though, this very solo appears severely edited and mutilated on the CD edition of this live recording. Since ""Folklore"" is by far the most interesting track on this album, I strongly recommend the vinyl to anybody interested on this great live music. A huge deception for a huge fan. LONG LIVE AHMAD!"
2,It's ok I guess,"Wish it came w/ a pin and a clip, comes w/ clip, ideal for waistline. Wish it had option for a beep mode, not just vibration. It was for my mom how is very forgetful. I wish was able to pin in on her so she doesn't take it off."
3,Cultural Garage Band,"I enjoyed most of the songs on this collection and love that distinctive 1960s electric guitar arrangements.What makes this collection stand out is that it reflects musical influences and styles from around the world. Listeners won't be disappointed to hear the classic sounds that helped define the Baby Boomers' Geration.Although I thought this was a decent collection and selection, I would still recommend ""Nuggets Original Artyfacts"" over this one."
5,Hilarious and Fun!,"My son brought home this book from school. Everyone in the family liked it so much that I had to purchase a copy for us to have at home. It is a lot of fun for ""kids of any ages"" (and I mean adults too). It is extremely clever and funny. I recommend it for everyone."
2,"Useful, but out of date","I found this book useful in many aspects, but its dependance on the ActiveX Layout Control really holds it back. (alx doesn't work proprely in IE4 and MS isn't going to fix it either) It is just faced with the same problem as most other internet technology publications, which is that it goes out of date shortly after the ink dries."
4,Awesome turntable for $150,"Great budget turntable. I don't really know exact turntable terminology... but here it goes: the chassis is rock solid, but the tonearm looks a bit cheap. The platter looks okay, until you turn it up to 45rpm, and it starts to look a little bit off-center. I haven't had run into any problems with this though- the platter may be off a little bit, but that seems to be fine, as long as the record itself isn't. I think all of these things are acceptable, considering this table is [...].After about 200 hours of play time, I started noticing the sound was more degraded. Hard to describe- more pops, hisses, highs aren't as clear. So I swapped out the cartridge with a Grado Black for [...]. Now the turntable sounds AMAZING."
4,decent entry level turntable,The 4 stars is arbitrary. This is no top end table such as Rega. But for the price it is decent and I have found the speed to be steady. Most of my music playing is CD's. I pretty much only buy vinyl music not available on CD. If you are an audiophile who plays a lot of vinyl this is not the table for you.
1,Huge dissappointment,"These speakers seemed like a good deal for in dash 5x7's. Unfortunately the sound quality was below the quality I had hoped for (and I was expecting much). Very flat sound overall.After 3 days of use one of the speakers developed a crackle which has forced me to stop using them all together. These speakers were hooked directly to the head unit and not powered by an amplifier. These speakers saw 40Watts peak. The speakers were played at the normal ""cruising"" level and the bass was about 1/2 way up. Considering the supposed power handling the speakers should not have had any problems. In the end I wish I had not purchased them and would recommend against others purchasing them.On a side note - the speakers do not mount flush. The center mid/tweet are raised above the mounting surface. I was expecting them to mount flush."
1,Save Your Money,A major disappointment. Jeff Madrick is very knowledgeable and well spoken but this book is little more than a sermon supporting big government and social programs.
1,The Black sheep of DVDs,"I bought one of these packs because of the price. I never had any problems with Memorex and their DVDs. As a matter of fact, it is the only brand I use. It recorded fine. Had no problem with that procedure what so ever. Then came the playback. It didn't do it. It did not playback. Not on the computer, not on any of my DVDs, not on my brother's, mother's, sister, nowhere. It was a waste of my money and time. Do not buy it."
1,Makes great coasters!!!,"Seriously, whenever I try to burn movies... well, lets just say the dvd's turn into coasters like magic!I since tried the Sony Brand DVD's... from best buy as I could not find the DVD-R 8X at Amazon, I I have never had a bad burn using Sony."
5,True story; great read,"This author has written many TV top-notched scripts for Emmy award shows.This was a true story on his life growing up and it was insightful and entertaining. If you like to read, you will like this one!!"
4,Melancholy Continues With Phantasmic Hopes !,"Gabo's fatalism,melancholy and agony continues in this Chef d'oeuvre making the reader believe that life is Despair as Kafka or Samuel Beckket experienced it.It's about a Colonel who had fought against the government for liberty, rights and freedom ..But after the Truce , the colonel still awaits his mail(pension).The mail and the Rooster are the only hope which are Keeping him alive with his wife..Full of Compassion , sympathy and sufferings .. A must read. If El Dorado ever existed in South America ,then Macondo- the oppsite- also exists there."
2,a sad book,"i think it is sad that some of the treasures of the world, coffee and tea, have been reduced to a bunch of facts and figures aimed to scare and coerce people to abandon a cornerstone of cultures and lifestyles. sure, caffeine needs moderation, so does everything, what else is new. i say drink up, life is too short to fall into the 'fad health' book mentality."
1,Do not order Linksys WRT350N ship from & sold by ANTOnline,"I ordered a new WRT350N router on July 19,2008. ANTOnline shipped a old/reburbished item and no Setup CD and documentation in the box. The package is unsealed and the item old/used router. There is no luck to contact the Seller ANTOnline. I have to end up to filled a complain with AMAZON."
1,Terrible software and poor performance,"I am a tech guy, and this is a terrible unit and mine died after one week. Hey Linksys, or Cisco if you wish, change your software and make it more user friendly without having to go to the IP which most ppl know nothing about"
2,Not so stable - needs to reboot every now and then,"I did not get a better reception than the 4 years old SMC router. My son also complained about me paying so much for this piece of crap when comparing to the SMC router that I owned for more than 4 years.Every now and then I had to reset this router ever after upgrading to the latest firmware. After several months, it finally died and I couldn't get it up anymore, i.e. never able to get to the http admin home page.Luckily, it has 3 years warranty, instead of getting a refurbished one of the same model, Linksys is sending me a refurbished WRT600N which suppose to me more expensive than the WRT350N. Not sure if it is sure but that's what the email said.But I am not so excited about getting the WRT600N either. Based on the review from other people, the WRT600N does not seem to be any better. Linksys has been selling good quality products but I am disappointed about the WRT350N. In this case, I do not recommend it to anyone."
3,Dissapointing Range,"This router has less range than my old Netgear Wireless-G router. Very dissapointing. Also, the setup wizard on the supplied CD didn't work with Windows XP, and I had to manually configure the router. Other than that, all router functions seem to work well, and the user interface is very good."
1,Not ready for prime time.,"As a simple G router it works fine but as something that promises more, it is a failure.First, the wireless range is no better than a G router.Second, the USB attachment for a network shared disk drive works poorly when it works at all, which isn't often.Third, Linksys was unable to help me get my network printer working at all which had previously been working just fine on a G router.So, all in all, I would recommend that you avoid this product."
4,"The Flying Flea, Callie, and Me Wallace,Bill and Carol","This book is about a cat that adopts a baby bird that has fallen out of it`s nest because the cat, Gray, doesn't like to eat birds. (Whoever heard of a cat that doesn't like to eat birds?) And when the bird (Gray calls Flea) goes south for the winter Gray is sad because she taught her how to fly.I thought this book was funny."
2,memogate anybody,"Dan Rather writes excellent stories, including those which are completely fabricated. Take the new ""memo"" which Rather seemed to have come across. Not only was the memo found to be false, but Rather is a suspect for writing it. Rather should resign and at least keep his dignity, and rid the american public of at least one liberal news anchor."
3,old book but still helpful,"author is a good business expert,although not academician, he has a good background in business.easy-to-read and smooth style,vast perspective in business. about globalization,international marketing and business.i recommend."
5,A Truly Gifted & Talented Musician Who Brings Music To Life,"Dan has a unique ability and gift to share his talent with the world. From writing and playing, he expresses the inner expressions that most of us feel. He has a style that is enjoyable, soulful and breathtaking. This is an album to enjoy, celebrate and share with your friends and family. Thanks Dan for bringing your gift to our world!"
5,Perfect for reluctant readers,My husband remembered loving this series as a kid and was delighted to be able to get them for our son. At age 7 our son would read the Enchanted Wood and the Faraway Tree over and over. Enid Blyton connects perfectly with the magical imagination of kids this age.
3,"Worthwhile, but not very helpful for me","I guess I expected too much from this book. It provides a framework that might be useful for improving on more complex situations, but otherwise it is geared toward some fairly basic situations of most use to young children I'd guess. I was hoping for more. I imagine this book is most useful as an introduction to the concepts and it probably does a good job for its intended purpose. I guess I was looking for something more sophisticated for adults that might work for DIY. Still it was worthwhile for me as a quick read. Now I'll have to move on to something like Emily Post."
3,Oddly organized,"Some helpful and clear information, though a bit of a hodge podge of thoughts. Concise, best for youngsters rather than adults."
2,Laptops Awry,"Frank Zappa was one of the first, programming unplayable music into his Synclavier so he, as a composer, was no longer bound by the limitations of real players. In the decade since, the state of the art in ""laptop music"" hasn't advanced very far, as evidenced by Tickmayer's busy, messy, largely unplayable goulash of notes. There are moments of clarity, tiny slices of lucidity amongst the g-spot tornados, but in general this album represents both the nightmares of professional musicians (being replaced by technology) and a pretty good case for why it'll never happen."
2,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER !,"The newest from Samsung STILL has MAJOR PROBLEMS... The only good thing I can report, is that they fixed the 4x3 aspect ratio issue it's predicessor had. HOWEVER, now the player has a few more bugs that Sansung doesn't even want to address. Whenever you are watching a disc, it will not remember the aspect ratio if you power down... Now if thats not bad enough, it will also, and this is the worse, default to SUBTITLES BEING ON ! You then have to go thru several soft keys to then cut it off ! This only happens when running off the battery..I went thru 3 of these players, they all had the same issue. The sound still sucks ! and the picture seems dimmer in order to save battery life a bit more... Oh well, needless to say, I was disappointed..."
4,Good Value,"I have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now, and the quality of the sound is excellent, particularly given the reasonable price. I'm sure you can get better performance, but it will cost much more. These speakers are a rare find in today's business world -- something that is actually a good deal...."
1,Junk - Don't waste your money,"I was originally very happy with this unit. The picture quality was good, the audio was good, it was easy to use, etc. I found a couple of DVDs would stutter (Insomnia) and one other would never work despite trying several copies of the same DVD (Enigma). Then, with less than 1 year into using the player, its audio signal became so weak that it was barely audible with my AV amp at max and the front display stopped working. I called an authorized Toshiba service center to find out that my problem was not unique and that it would cost $95 to fix. Don't bother with this unit unless you are looking for a disposable DVD player to last you about a year."
2,don't recommend,"has trouble playing dvd (seven samurai, and Casablanca)this player locks up, these dvd will work on pc.mp3 player will play only if sample rate is 44.1k."
2,Stopped working after 18 months,The Toshiba SD2710 was fine while it lasted. After a momentary power outage while the unit was running it stopped working. This was after 18 months of light use. Replacing the fuse didn't help and having it on a surge protector didn't help. These low cost DVD players don't seem to last very long. I am replacing it with a Sony DVP SN325. I'll see how long that lasts.
1,Sound Died in One Year,"We purchased this in December 2001. In late December 2002 we watched a movie and the sound cut out to the point that we had to turn up the stereo and T.V. very loud to hear it. Intermittently the sound would come back to full strength, which nearly blew out our speakers. Upon calling tech support they said it was broken and to have service performed. Considering the warranty expired and service will be more than a new player, we will buy a new one. We are not likely to purchase a Toshiba considering we were only able to watch about 15 DVD's before this one broke."
2,Broke down after a couple of months of very light use,"I got this for my mom's birthday in February. By end of March, it stopped working. When we tried to take it to the manufacturer, it cost [price] for them to take a look at it and was supposed to cost [price] to fix. Keep in mind that this is WITH warranty. Since the whole thing cost [price], it seemed ridiculous to spend [price] to fix it. So my mom is now looking to buy another DVD player and I vowed to never buy electronics as gifts again :)"
4,Quality product,"This is the second dvd player that i have purchased, the first being a sony that did not play cdr's, but did play cdrw's. This toshiba plays both, has DTS out and component outs. From reading many reviews sony's or toshiba's are the way to go, and i have not yet had a problem reading a dvd disc in either. I recommend this player because of its price, its ability to read burnt discs, and is reputation. I havent tried the mp3 capabilities yet because i am waiting for a receiver and speakers."
1,Just to add to the mass of other negative reviews...,"I bought a new DVD player recently and decided to give my year-and-a-half-old Toshiba to my mother. She decided to give it a try a few days ago but couldn't hear any audio. I thought she configured something wrong in the menus or in her tv, so I said I'd give it a look, thinking that I'd find the problem in 5 minutes. Well, to cut to the chase, I didn't, and now I'm reading all those reviews telling the same tale...I guess I'll have to buy another one today to replace this piece of crap... Don't worry, I won't go near any Toshiba unit...JS"
4,Style and Class,"Like ""Purpaleanie and other Permutations"", Style and Class is a montage of short stories by former Calvin College Professor Stanley Wiersma, aka. Sietze Buning. In this installment, Wiersma explores the concepts of ""style"" and ""class"" as they relate to two small towns in northwest Iowa.The vignettes are pithy and humorous. We can laugh at the characters and yet, we can empathize with them as well, and begin to ask ourselves: ""Do I merely have style, or do I really have class?"" You will have to read the book to find out the answer."
4,Straps a bit wide,"These are pretty nice casual sandals, but my feet tend towards the narrow side and the straps don't fit snugly around my feet...perhaps it would have worked out better in a narrow width, but all they had was medium width."
3,Kanekalon,I bought this hair I was shocked when I got the hair because the color was really off I thought I ordered dark hair but it was kind of reddish or Oberon hope I spelled that right I have never tried color but took a chance it turned out okay but I think the color chart needs to be changed because the picture looks like dark hair and it was totally off wouldn't mind buying more but afraid that it will be the wrong color I did get it really fast so Thanks Amazon 3 stars are for color mistake
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I am more than pleased with these speakers considering what I paid for them. Do they sound like the high-end Bose speakers? No. But for the price, they are an excellent value. I mounted them in the backyard under the eaves so we would have music when in the pool and they sound very good. I am pushing them with a Kenwood tuner and these things will jam. I can turn them up pretty loud with little distortion...certainly louder than the normal listening level we will be using. I would certainly recommend these speaker to anyone looking for good sound on a low budget."
1,Does not work!!!,I have a Dell Dimension 4700 with NEC ND-3100 DVD+R recorder and it does not record on Memorex but does well on Verbatim .I dont recomend this midia.
4,Quality,"As good or better than any DVD+Rs that I have tried. And I have tried them all. None are perfect, so I gave the Memorex 4 stars."
1,"Don't buy from this vendor. Batteries that I got were old, not working with an expired date on label.","Don't buy from this vendor. Batteries that I got were old, not working with an expired date on label."
5,A very great book. A must-have book for advanced pianists.,This book is a part of 2-book set. Both books are must-haves for advanced pianists. The quoality of printing is good. Notes are clear. Transcendental etudes are in book 1 and Paganini Etudes are in book 2. Do not hesitate to buy this book if you are fond of Liszt. You must be an advanced pianist to be able to play most pieces in the book.
3,end of life pamphlet,Not the greatest on the subject so I passed it along to someone else. Not worth to be a part of my library.
2,Sizing is very inaccurate!!,"Similar to other reviewers, i ordered a large based on package sizing. At 5'6"", i expected to be able to get the crotch above mid thigh! No amount of stretching or pulling would make them fit. Smartwool needs to revise the sizing info printed on the packaging! I have many pairs of smartwool sox and love this brand overall v disappointed with these tights."
2,Good fit!,"I couldn't rate these higher because though I take good care, I got a small hole that shows on the leg in the first wearing. So not so durable. Love other smart wool products. I have many ski socks (knee highs & short) and not one of them has gotten a hole in them after many, many wearings and tough use."
1,Waste of time,"If you want to read about a really BORING person who hates capitalism, actually anything un-Communist, this is your novel. Roth writes about the far-left as if it were ""correct"". But this could make for lively drama in the hands of a ""skilled"" (that's what I've heard at least) writer. None of the characters are the least bit interesting and the writing is redundant. Roth writes like a little kid who uses big words to show off. This is the first of Roth that I have read and it will be the last. This is a terrible book. Absolutely horrible."
3,not polarized,I was disappointed with these sunglasses because I assumed they were exactly like the ones I bought years ago from a local drug store. The difference is that these are non polarized. They didn't advertise them as being polarized so it's my fault for not paying closer attention.
2,Older versions of Cakewalk are better,"I just wanted to say that this program is very buggy and does many counterintuitive things that annoy you when you are using it. It just doesn't feel very solid overall. You can tell that the code they used has been around for awhile, with band-aids applied with each release, as opposed to just rewriting it.There are many visual artifacts that get left behind when moving notes, etc. I think there are way too many features in this program that bog it down and decrease its feel and efficiency. I had to use this version though, because Cakewalk Apprentice (which I really like) doesn't recognize my midi devices of the sblive in WinXP.It does do a few nice things, like put controllers right along with the piano roll, and gives many options when copying & pasting."
1,ridiculous,"Rubbish. There is no such thing as Zionism as represented in this book. There is no global, centralized political body of any Jewish anything, and there never was. Israel is not run by ""Zionists"". The original socialist Zionists died out decades ago. It was merely a movement to establish statehood for a few people who were admittedly, communist. It had nothing to do with world power or money and the religious world and vast majority of Jews were against it. There are a few religious ""Zionists"" but that is completely different. They are a minority and have no real power or desire to do anything other than to live in Israel."
1,Thoroughly Disappointed,"This is an amateur, home-made video. The soundtrack does not correspond with the on-screen action, and the picture is even out of focus at times. I had originally intended on buying ""Video Catnip"", based on our excellent experience when I bought it for my previous 2 cats 10 years ago. After reading the description of this DVD, I thought it sounded more fun than Video Catnip, so I thought I would buy it instead. Sadly, neither of my existing cats (2 years and 4 years old) were even remotely interested in this video.I should have gone with my original plan."
2,My cats must be media-averse,"I have 3 female cats: one is 17 and the other 2 are sisters, about 8 months old. I bought the video hoping to give the two little kitties something to do while I was gone during the day. I put the TV down on the floor, not far from their food and water. I played the video, and watched from a distance to see their reaction. Total indifference! They paid absolutely no attention to it whatsoever. I have tried turning up the sound, playing each segment continuously--nothing works. My cats are far more interested in sitting on the window seat and watching the street, which has no squirrels or bugs or birds. Go figure."
1,Not for every cat...,"I bought this DVD for my cat based upon the 3 5-star reviews that were available at the time I placed my order. Based upon those avaiable reviews, I thought this would be the best DVD to buy. My husband and I have concluded that perhaps this DVD is meant for cats that are more independent and possibly left alone more often than our cat. Our cat is very active and plays with us for hours every day. She is rarely left alone. She was totally bored with this DVD. In fact, I could not get her to even look at the animals. She would rather watch the live hummingbirds feeding outside our living room window and chase spiders around the house. She did notice the red ribbon but bored of that in about 5 seconds."
1,while you were gone cat video,While you were gone the cats DIED from boredom. Only two words needed to rate this sick DVD. IT SUCKS. I wish i could it no stars. What a sorry ripoff. The seller should be arrested for fraud. Amazon sucks for offering it.
4,Best for background Music,"Pros: Lightweight, easy to install with brackets included, and a GOOD price-performance relation. Considering the limitations of the drivers and the housing etc, it is a good deal. The mid-range and high-range definition is pretty good.Cons:Just slightly overstepping that what the bass driver can handle, and it will sound really ugly. When we reach that point, the speaker is hardly handling 18W RMS power. In other words: The speaker is overrated being called 100W.My conclusion:These speakers are best for multi-room low-level ambient music. It has an emphasis on the 7-8 KHz range, saying that some sources like cymbals sound harsh. Nothing that cannot be fixed with an EQ. The mid range 300-6000 Hz is very well defined and balanced, given the size of the speaker.As said: A good deal, but DON'T expect 100W from it."
1,Way Too Much!,"Im not sure if I am the only one who agrees to this. I admit, I am ""in"" to stereos, and anything that can make them louder and hit harder while still keeping that crystal clarity that I find so hard to acheive. And I am a firm beleiver in the phrase 'you get what you pay for.' But come on, unless you just happen to have $ that you can just go out and blow on a set of speakers, isn't the price a little ridiculous?"
3,Where is Billy Joel???,"Where is Billy Joel???The Billy Joel Bike episode is left off of this disc set. The Billy Joel Bike episode should be the last episode on this disc set, but it is not there. Also, there is no episode menu on any of these discs."
5,Hinge doctor is the ticket,To be able to retrue a door with out taking it down or ussing shims is a real time saver
4,Margarine v. Butter,"While some may take this to be a one-joke book (wooing an international tourist economy by recreating all of England's most famous, market-tested landmarks into a more manageable, mini-England on the Isle of Wight), I find it to be a clever lens through which the reader can observe and consider the foibles of modern Western (not just British) society. On the way it raises many interesting questions: What is the role of memory in personal and national identities? Why and how do we seek to exercise control over others? How are we shaped by the roles we assume (regardless of our motives for accepting these roles)? When is what we choose to believe about reality more powerful than reality itself? And let's not forget, What is the role of sex in history?While this book by Julian Barnes does not have any of the understated poignancy that I enjoyed and expected to find after reading FLAUBERT'S PARROT, it is clever and engaging in its own way. A fun read if you can handle the artifice."
3,"Funny, quirky, twisting and turning","This was only my second Julian Barnes book, the first being the (quite good) ""History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters"". I'd have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this novel wasn't quite as good as the idea, and that the ending was something of an anticlimax. There were enough twists and turns in the plot to keep me interested, and possibly the best thing I can say about it is that there are nuggets of hilarity embedded throughout."
1,Totally Disappointed,"It is now March 27th and despite several emails to amazon and its supplier, I have received no response and am still out the money I paid in good faith for this product. It was promised by March 18 and I'm sitting here with a debit on my credit card and nothing to show for it. Maybe other customers have similar experiences. Someone's got to speak up!"
4,inspirational and contemplative,"simple and short but very profound songs, psalms and chants from the western latin/english tradition. great for easy listening or incorporating into personal devotional or meditative prayer. the quality of the recording was not what it could be. although stylistically this would probably more familiar to Catholics i would recommend these psalms and songs for any Christians seeking to recapture more traditional and Scripture based worship venues within the modern context of their daily lives."
5,Easy on the scalp,I have a few moles on my head (TMI) that tend to be sensitive and it really hurts when I snag them with a comb or brush that has stiff bristles. This brush doesn't have the softest bristles but they are resting in a cushion that has some generous give so this thing doesn't bother me at all. If you have long hair that tends to get knotted or tangled then this probably isn't your best bet but it works for my needs. It's a bit lighter than I expected and seems like it's pretty cheaply made but for the price and as well as I'll take care of it it should last a long time.
3,Nothing startling,"Decent documentary, but now dated, as some of the dates for anticipated events mentioned are now in the past. Results of the surveys are not surprising; Western societies are becoming more secular."
1,"Terrible Documentary, by all means, stay away","This documentary is terrible. It's shot poorly, the questions that they ask people just keep repeating and the set up is terrible. Everything about this video is bad. Do we really need the bible to tell us that the climate of the world has changed? This video is a load of crap, as you can see, our currency has not changed and we still have our sovereignty. Dont watch this garbage documentary, its probably one of the worst you've ever seen"
2,Slow moving,"This documentary didn't seem to go anywhere. Repetitive questioning of people got annoying. I expected more of a documentary that compares what is going on now with what Revelations predicts. Although there may have been a bit of that, the story moved very slowly and i found myself watching, waiting for it to get better. It was disappointing."
1,Do Not Buy This Tape,"I went through the original tape and two replacements...with the same problem in all the tapes. The audio is terrible and completely goes out half way through the thing. The video is washed out with skipping and scratches. The degradaded color reminds me of how a roll of my film turned out after it sat in the glove box during a Las Vegas summer day. In three places it appears that the original film used for transcribing broke, copying was stopped to put the thing back together and started again. All three tapes I received have exactly the same defect.They will refund me now. As soon as I mail back the three tapes;...I will order the [other] version of this movie that they sell. I really enjoy seeing the people entertain whom I could only listen to during my childhood."
2,Not Vista64 compatible,"Be warned--though the manufacturer claims Vista compatibility, this thing is NOT Vista64 compatible (per Sony Support). With some work, I was able to configure a workaround, but it's not supported by Sony. And the japanese firmware update someone else posted looks great, but simply will not install on a 64-bit OS.The Sony support site for this is a debacle. It's a shame, because the hardware itself is beautiful and sounds great (not a ton of base, but no distortion at all). There's really nothing else like it on the market--too bad Sony of America doesn't see fit to really support it.The (only) glaring deficiency for the hardware is the inability to quickly scroll through lists. I use it to play randomly through my whole collection, so I can deal with it, but it's a serious issue for normal playback of any good sized media library."
5,sony vgf-wa1,"Fantastic, IF you really like live365 radio and are lucky enough to get it on sale through amazon. Set up is pretty straight forward, particularly if you read the manual with regard to identifying the radio id to activate on the live365 website. Great product overall."
1,Hard to set-up - still haven't got it working.,"We bought this item thinking it'd be easy to set-up but that was far from the truth. After installing the server software I have been unable to get the Sony box to connect to anything on my network. I have pulled my hair out looking at Windows Vista (our OSes on our PCs) networking, WLAN security (802.1x WEP) and more and have yet to find a solution. I tried Sony help for 45 minutes but they also failed to assist me so I have been redirected to another phone # that I have to call. Ugh!!!!"
4,Update Firmware to 1.2,"Good quality music streamer out of the box, but with limitations. Excellent device when updated to firmware version 1.2 that allows connection to networks with no SSID broadcast (with the original firmware I had to change my access point settings to SSID broadcast each time I wanted to use the WA1, even with the SSID entered manually in the device settings), and also allows to create your own list of web radios using the companion software WA1 Enhanced Settings tool(installed on a computer on the network and transmitting infos to the WA1 thru wifi). You're no longer limited to built-in services.Strangely, Sony does not offer the firmware revision on the US site. You have to download it from the Japanese site. Look for a file named SOFOTH-01589600-UN.exe and follow instructions."
1,This book can be safely skipped,"A good book should be concise, clear and also should pack good deal of information. This book fails on all 3 counts.1)This is a thick book which makes for a nice pillow, yet the topics, I wanted to learn, lack depth. And I am talking about adders and multipliers. After skimming thr' adders & multipliers, I could find very little new info I not knew about. This book should have been titled ""Introduction to digital arithmetic"".2)The notation and the figures used in the book are unconventional and hard to follow. I had a tough time to read thr' 5 pages without getting frustated. You have to think hard just to figure out what the authors want to tell.Finally I want to say, if you want to learn about digital arithmetic, better buy Koren. I bought both the books at the same time, and found Koren lot better. IMO putting 1hr effort on reading Koren = 10hrs effort reading this book"
2,Read 'Princess of Fire' first!,"Traditionally and historically proven, novels of offsprings of passionate, vibrant, exciting, reckless, exhilirating, and dangerous characters whom became their parents never 'measure up'. Allora and Brett, even though they lived in as dangerous a time as Brett's parents, the excitement, passion, sensuality, and even the fierce battles paled in comparison to Fallon and Alaric, Brett's parents in 'Princess of Fire'."
4,rugged and roomy,"A good value if you need the filters and the USB compactflash reader/Writer. The filters must used with a UR-E6 adapter (around [good price]) if you want to use them on a Coolpix 5000. The USB compactflash reader/writer works fine, but a FireWire reader/writer is even quicker(around [a good price])The small leather case for Coolpix 5000(around [a little less]) fits in the large adjustable divider compartment very comfortably. There is room remaining for 2 or 3 lenses and a mini tripod in the large adjustable divider compartment. 2 fair sized latching side pockets and thin zippered divided front pocket can be used for whatever else you may like to have with your camera. I still suggest carrying your camera and case in a ugly worn Gym bag or something less attractive to deter theft."
2,"Great sound, for the short time the battery lasts....","I am a dedicated Sony consumer, so when I bought a digital cordless, naturally I bought Sony. Unfortunately, Sony has frankly **[been bad]** on one of the most important features of this phone - the battery. They obviously cut corners in this one area to add more trinkets to the phone. Which are great - caller id on the base and the handset, scrolling address book on the handset, speed dial memory, speaker phone, etc.; but, if the battery is dead after using the phone for an hour, then what use is the features! I'm not a phone junkie, in fact I hate being on the phone, but I work at home and end up on some long calls which halfway through get cut off and I have to switch to my corded phone across the house from my office. Bummer Sony! I've seen the same complaint on several other Sony cordless phones as well, so maybe I would suggest checking out another brand!"
3,Gener@tion Debt,"Great book, but I originally had wanted to order the author's more recent book, not this one from 2006. Unfortunately you apparently only carry the current one on Kindle, which would be challenging for my old eyes! In any event, the one I received was interesting even though somewhat dated. Not sorry I ordered it because I've shared it with friends who have found it informative."
4,"Cute figures, and good size for little hands.","My only complaint is that the poor Abuela is so huge and doesn't bend at all, so she can't do anything but stand around cooking in the kitchen - poor woman can't even sit to eat with the family!!! That is just nuts!!!! I would like to see a car for Tico to drive the Dora gang around in!!! We love our ""papi house"" as my 2 year old calls it!!!"
3,Dora,The baby in my house just loves the toy. She's 2 and she plays with them and they dont seem capable of breaking. I find it a good gift to give anyone who has to get for a child of 2 and up.
3,Sister of the more famous Betty,"Mary Bard was apparently the impetus for Betty Bard MacDonald's career as a writer of the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books, as well as other wonderfully funny books for adults. Though Mary is amusing and interesting to read for period details, her writing lacks the lightness, sparkle and mordant wit of her sister's. Still, you will probably enjoy this book. I did."
4,A Thorough Overview and Application Guide of NP,"Not a bad book, considering it gives you the fundamentals of a variety of topics well covered in network programming. It is the only source of its kind I have found to address network programming without being almost exclusively tied to web development. I looked at it in light of it's C# orientation (because I'm a VB.NET developer), and found a lot of good basic coverage. Bewarned: If you are not an intermediate programmer, whether C# or VB.NET, it will take a little to get up to speed. The style is not bad - surprising, given the number of authors, and you CAN learn from it. I give it actually a 4.2-4.5, but I can't give it quite the 5-star rating. :-P"
4,My Oppinion,"Wow! The Magician's Nephew is one of a kind. When ever I hear about reading im not the one to jump up and down but this book really got to me. It felt I was really in the book!!C.S. Lewis is a really good writer--When a friend had told me about the seriesI was interested and now I can't put one of his booksdown they are fantastic!!This book was such a page turner for me I kept wanting to find out about Polly and Digory!!This has to be one of my favorite books, It had me soo excited, my favorite part had to be when they were transported. This was so detailed I really thought as if it was me putting on the green and yellow rings and going to new place. But"
5,it makes so much sense,"Farming is an art and a craft. The message I kept receiving in this book was ""harmony"". I liked it so much that when I lost my original copy (which was brought to me from England) I decided I needed another."
2,Low quality - not worth the price,"These bits' low quality is obvious from their shoddy workmanship - notice no close-ups are provided. Even the box looks like something kids made. The set may actually be functional, but why bother when you can getDremel 692 6-Piece Router Bit Setfor less? I'll be returning these & getting the latter."
3,Not a bad movie,"I saw the film, ""The Garbage Picking, Field Goal cicking, Philadelphia Phenomenon."" It had a good plot, but it was totally unrealistic and unbelievable. In the film Toney Danza plays Barny Gorman, a garbage men who is struggling to make enough money to support his family. The family does okay finantually because Barny's wife is a doctor at a local hospital. All of a sudden life changes drastically in the Gorman house hold when Barny is spotted by the public relations manager for the struggling Philadelphia Eagles. She spots him cicking water jugs at the garbage lot, and tells him to try out for a job as the Eagles place cicker. He does, and the next thing you know he finds himself making a lot of money, and living the life of a profetional football player. He gets big headed and starts neglecting his responsibilities to his family. Gorman is a great cicker though, he turns the team around, and to the disbelief of his team mates who don't think he will do any thing."
1,not happy,I cannot rate this experience with this seller as good because I have some very dissappointed grandkids right now. The cd/dvd will not play. They have tried it on 2 pcs. It will not open. Getting a refund. They are not happy at all. They love this game.
4,Old PS ONE game still fun,With the PS3 out and the advances in gameplay in the fighting genre this game might seem trite but the videos of actual K-1 fighters alone are worth it. The game itself is a fun blast to the past for collectors of fighting games.The play action is very real time and allows you to build skill sets for your favorite fighter. For 3 five bucks it is a deal.
5,great for relaxing at the end of the day,"I originally bought this CD because I enjoy other music by Marty Haugen and David Haas. Their songs are quite familiar in our Catholic church and I found them nice to listen to and sing along with for my newborn twins. The boys are now 16 months old and we all love to wind down at bedtime with the instumental versions of these songs. As Tim Vakoc said above, this is music that everyone will enjoy. I look forward to more instrumental works by these gentlemen."
2,Directed towards a British audience,"I bought this book because I believed it would be an American's recommendations to a rising European Union.Instead, it is a British book written by an American who has become more or less British who tries to show the British that they have something to offer Europe if they came to believe more in the British way themselves.There are some interesting thoughts in Siedentop's book, but on the whole, I thought it was rather boring and irrelevant to me as a Dane."
4,For the good of America keep God general (the devil is in the detaiis),"The author makes the case that, according to the history he cites, America is not a Christian nation. A public God/the Creator is at the center of the Founding but Jesus for the good of this nation has been kept in the private relm. If we get in to too much detail about our ""Public Religion"" there will be too much strife.I subtract one star, because Jon Meacham did not compare the ""American Gospal"" to the ""Gospal"" (if any) of other nations."
4,Balanced View of Separation of Church and State,"Meacham's book will disappoint both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Christian Fundamentalists. He finds a place for God in the public square and supports the establishment clause in the Constitution. His portraits of the religious or non-religious propensities of our founding fathers is well done without any preconceived notions on Meacham's part. Although not a truly academic book, it belongs to that portion of your library on Constitutional Law."
5,Separation of Church and State?,"It's always interesting to know that our founding fathers who thought up separation of church and state were so deeply religious. I also recommend the book called, IF JESUS IS SO DARN LOVING THEN WHY IS MY LIFE IN THE CRAPPER."
3,This is CMC Mag R03 8X,"All the previous reviews need to be updated. CMC Mag's 8X or speedier media have improved significantly since the 4X. As long as your burner is not one of those 1st or 2nd generation (AKA 2.4X or 4X) burners which do not have the writing strategy for the faster media like the 8X (requires firmware update); then you should have no problem with the new CMC media. Anyway, it is still not worth 70 cents a piece, maybe 50 cents.In general, the quality of newer media starts from 8X is much better for all manufacturers, but I still don't want to touch Optidisc, Princo, and An32 media code discs."
1,Poor,"Ive been through 8 dvd's, 1 failed, 1 was not seen as blank media, the others wrote successfully but are unreadable on 1 pc dvd rom, another pc dvd rom and the writer itself. The media looks like it has been written to but coating is fainter then the last batch. Now I just finished a small spindle of non printable Memorex DVD+R and had no problems. And literally, nothing changed besides the media. Pass up this package. Too good to be true."
3,Wraparounds,These wraparound sunglasses are okay in a pinch. I need something for inside the car when the photo grays don't darken. These offer some relief form the sun's glare.
2,"""Another Ono History Hatchet Job""","I heard that before going into this film and now I know why: anyone vaguely familiar with John's life should feel a little uncomfortable at the revisionism going on with his legacy.Just like Yoko did with that dismal Broadway show that bombed this year, she's edited out so much of John's life that even his fans can't be too excited about any new project. No mention of the Beatles. Tons of attention lavished on his second son and no mention of the first. Whole years missing (his ""lost weekend"" of 1973-74).At some point I expect a new John Lennon documentary...with John Lennon edited out.A much more superior look at John Lennon can be found in IMAGINE, from the producers of THIS IS ELVIS."
1,How can I watch it?,Beware people from Auztralia even though other NTSC might work on your DVD THIS DOESN'T WORK unless you have a fancy machine or can play it through computor I carn't. Caveat emtor.
4,skilful cultures,"In societies like the US, that are predominantly descended from European cultures, more is known about the Bronze Age in Europe and the Middle East than elsewhere. So this book is a nice counterbalance. It shows what is currently known about places in south east Asia, when the Greeks were in their golden age and before Rome was powerful.The book's illustrations of recovered figurines and other artifacts reveals a high degree of sophistication in metalworking and pottery. Equal in skill to the best that Greece or Egypt could make. The agricultural abilities were also widespread. Several crops were extensively cultivated; enough to support urban centres. There are also indications of trade within the region.Pity that time has left us so few tangible records."
2,not as pictured,"the driftwood I received was nothing like in the picture, its pretty much flat. but it still works. nice color."
1,Bad Customer Service/warranty,"We bought the Singing machine for Christmas 2007. The kids loved it until 4 months later when it stopped playing the CD's. NOTE: THE WARRANTY IS ONLY FOR 3 MONTHS!!!!! That alone should have been a warning to me. Anyway, I contacted the company to see if they would provide some good customer service and repair it anyway and they said it would cost $45 to send it in plus shipping cost. In other words almost as much as a new one. As much as the kids loved it, I will not buy another one because I feel it is a poorly made machine. Beware!Anything with only a 3 month warranty should be a big red flag for the consumer! Purchase at your own risk.P.S. My kids are very easy on their toys and most look as new after a year of playing with them. There was no damage to the machine."
2,music machine,"Contacted seller with a problem on 1-14-09 and have not heard back yet from them. Machine arrived as promissed and very quick, but not getting response back on tech. advise."
1,Completely Useless,"We had great hopes for this machine, however, the unit we received was unable to perform the most basic karaoke function, that is, playing CD+G discs. Connected to our TV, all discs, including the sample disc included with the unit, had such display difficulty that if you didnt already know the song, you wouldnt be able to sing along. The words only display halfway, and sometimes were displayed one line on top of the other. This was with three different brands of discs.If this was not bad enough, the mic quality was poor; the sound was muffled, and had a bad static feedback.We're returning our unit to either purchase a different type, or possibly a mic and amp as our DVD player will play CD+G."
2,The microphone broke after two days,"The machine got great reviews from others, but after two days of use, the microphone broke. My daughter is so disappointed and now I am in a bind trying to find another microphone. I thought this was an all in one type thing for the electronically-challenged, but apparently not! The singing machine is sitting broken and in a corner. Not a nice gift, I think."
2,Is it sealed?,The container works out okay but you cannot tell if it is sealed or not. Sometimes when I go back to the container and hit the button on top to unseal it it is already unsealed and the food is bad inside it.
2,Wont hold a seal...,"My canister does not hold a seal either. I did not even use the product within the 30 day return period with Amazon, Jardin is out of stock so I have to call back in 4-6 weeks...Looks like the wont hold seal is not a isolated problem."
1,Avoid this canister,"I bought one of these canisters directly from Foodsaver. Within 6 weeks I noticed it would not hold a vacuum over night. I also noticed hairline cracks in the corner. I called the Foodsaver company and they were happy to send me another one. Now, the replacement one has the exact same problem. This time when I called they stated that there is no guarantee on canisters at all. I never dropped or abused this item. If I wanted to replace it I would have to pay full price and shipping. (I have no problem with the round canisters.)"
2,Not quite up to snuff,"The RDR-VXD655 records eratically when recording VCR tapes. Sometimes they are almost as good as my 10 year old recorder, but often they are so poor that I don't consider them worth viewing.The playing of my old tapes is consistently good.The DVD recorder is well behaved. My only complaint here is that to view the title list on the DVD could be easier. If you just press the ""title list"" button on the remote nothing happens. First you have to press a button on the top of the remote that switches you to DVD from VCR, then the ""title list"" button will display titles. Since the ""title list"" is only applicable to the DVD; Sony should have programmed it so that when you press the ""title list"" button it automatically switches to DVD and shows you the titles.I haven't tried the other features but this is a very poor start."
4,SONY STILL MAKES THE BEST!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best DVD/VCR recorders I have come across. I have had absolutely no problems with it, both recording and playback. I received it from the shipper as scheduled, on time, and in perfect condition. Easily set up, the unit worked as depicted in the instruction booklet. Another SONY great!"
1,Hard to use and unreliable,"The audio stop working while under warrenty which was repaird with the price of postage. I bought and excellent Magnavox while waitibg for the repairs. The Sony was difficult to use, directions left a lot to be desired, no comparison to the Magnavox. When the repaired unit was returned I placed in a secondary hardily use role. The audio again went out on a machine that rarely used. A piece of junk."
5,small leather waist pack,My order arrived very fast. I love it. It is just what I needed.I also ordered two of the larger ones. I can't use these but I hate to return anything. I will give these away.Thanks for the quick order. Sincerely: Wanda
4,Season Two.,"This season is interesting bc things are changed up a bit. I like how the selection for models was a lil different, but unfortunately it felt like the talent was bland compared to the first season. More inovated thinkers as far as design goes but they didnt all seem to grasp the concept of the client. Love the show but would love to see greater talent."
3,Good show bad disks,The show it's self is great . We got this because we were watching reruns of this each day but the channel that was carrying it every was cut off. So we got this to help us get our project runaway fix. But at key times in the show this disk messes up. I don't know if we got a bad batch or it is too old or what but was disappointed in the condistion of the disk.
4,Very good built-in speakers,"I bought two pairs of these for installation in a new house, one pair for the living room, one pair for the kitchen. They produce brilliant highs and a clean midrange. Don't take that 28 hz figure too seriously though; no 8"" speaker I know of will give really convincing lows without an elaborate enclosure (which these don't have). Having said that, I still think the bass is good, just don't expect to shake the walls unless you add a subwoofer to the system. The speakers are excellent on vocals, speech, and background music, which is how I plan to use them. Considering the price and performance, They are an outstanding buy."
2,Save Your Time and Your Money,"I thought I had bought a book about dating, not new-age psycho-babble. Although this Idiot's Guide is not entirely without merrit, it offers nothing out of the ordinary in comparison to other dating books and has many silly components thrown in. The pick-up lines were woeful to say the least and many of the author's ideas were a little too out of left field to handle. A fantastic dating book worth purchasing is Rabbi Shmuley Boteach's ""Dating Secrets of the Ten Commandments"". It is a book which makes real sense and gives the reader not only encouragement, but really makes one truly believe that there is a ""special"" person just waiting for them."
1,RIPP OFF!!!,"What a shock when we received these sheets in the mail! We paid $53 and all they are are plain white, very thin sheets. The pillow case is white with a team stamp on them. I went to Walmart and got a complete bedding set for $65, with printed sheets!! Would NOT recommend this product."
1,Very Disappointed,I am a big fan of Julie Garwood's historical romances and I was looking forward to reading her contemporary romance 'Mercy'. I was very disappointed. I listened to the audio book and it didn't hold my interest in the least. There isn't anything good I can say about this book. The book is simple minded with a repetitive theme which doesn't develop to hold the readers interest.
5,My Favorite Book By Far,"I never take time to write reviews for anything but I'm shopping for the few Julie Garwood books I haven't had the plesure of reading yet and I came across this book. I have probably bought it 4 times over the past 5 years and I have re-read it more than a few times. I can honestly say hands down that this is my favorite book. I'm 21 and as a young adult I was captured by the excellent story line and fantastic writing. It's funny at times and definately pulls at your heart strings. Read this book! Expecially because if you fall in love with it like I did, Julie Garwood has other contemporary novels just as amazing. Mercy was the first Garwood book I ever read and now look at me, I can't get enough of her writing! She's simply amazing!"
1,NOT one of the usual great Garwood books. Her worst.,"Sorry to say, but this is not one of her best works. And since I've read all of her books (some of them multiple times) I can honestly say this is her worst. The plot was so-so, but the story and characters were incredibly underdeveloped and shallow. A brilliant surgeon falling for a guy on looks alone. One word to describe this book? BLAH!"
1,Complete Junk,My 3 year old son is a cars fanatic. I thought he would love to play this with me. He loves perfection. But this toy is complete junk. The parts don't snap in and only two of the wheels come off. And they just fall off sadly. It is total and complete junk. There is not a single redeeming quality behind this toy. Don't waste your money. Mattel and Disney should be ashamed for marketing this.
4,A wonderful collection but a bit dated now,"Taize is a place that transcends any marketing. You cannot know what Taize is without having been there...sorry but I don't know any other way to put it. If you have been however, you will immediately connect with the songs on this CD. The only issue with this CD is that it was recorded 18 years ago now. Minor adjustments have been made to some of the chants that are on this CD that are still in use at Taize. Those changes (all of which are improvements) create slight distractions when listening to this particular CD. All in all though, definitely one you should own.Peace"
3,A Little Wide..,"I have a narrow foot, so these shoes fit me a bit loosely...If your foot is narrow then don't get these, otherwise they're extremely cute shoes."
1,Waste of time,"I bought this book because I thought it was going to present the effect the Shaolin Temples had on the development of Asian martial arts. Much to my chagrin, the book did nothing of the kind.Essentially, the book is a long tribute by Andy James to Andy James - Buddhist master, martial arts expert, and fount of wisdom. He details his training under Theravada (Southeast Asian Hinayana Buddhist) masters. He talks in a general way about different types of martial arts. He takes some time out to denigrate other forms of Buddhism.What he doesn't do is talk about the Shaolin temples, the connection between the temples and martial arts, or explain what their legacy might be.As a practicing Buddhist and martial artist, I found this book to be disappointing. Don't bother buying it."
3,For those considering PhD process,"A book for the student considering doctoral degree and who does not understand the process. Not very helpful for those who are understand process but would like an indepth reference showing the differences between abstracts, conclusions, etc.; qualitative vs. quantitative research papers. Also, updates from authors such as Huth would be more helpful, as well as from Journal editors."
4,A good guide,This is great for some helpful overall tips and such. It WILL NOT tell you anything that a good adviser/mentor doesn't already know!
3,The Real McCall: An American Storyteller,"Great CD, if only I had found it as MP3 downloads I wouldn't have had to buy this entire CD. I am relatively happy."
2,Rambling and Unfocused,"I expected alot from this book, and did, indeed, glean some useful insights. I am sure there is much, however, that I did not get from the work due to it's style. There is no focus in the composition, and most of the time it seems to ramble with no clear direction. The author does not state her thesis and present her supporting evidence; rather, she has an almost stream-of-consciousness approach, pulling in seemingly unrelated materials and ideas, depending upon the reader to make the connections. Her scholarship and love of the material are evident, but the author's style doesn't allow the reader to assimilate nearly enough of what she has to offer."
4,"Move over, Indiana Jones!","A book written for youngsters, this ""kid"" read it all at one sitting. I even put aside a horror/suspense novel written by the master that is currently a best seller to read it. This is a story full of the adventure of exotic lands and peoples, and the mysteries of lost tribes and treasures. Reminds me very much of the ""Indiana Jones"" stories. Mr. Overby has a real talent for writing, and I feel he will go far in his chosen genre."
4,Lovely,Bought this for my wedding. Truly a stunning set. Received tons of complements on this and asked where i purchased it. Tad on the pricey side when i bought it though.
2,Lack of English Skills Destroy this Work,"While doing my thesis, I was forced to utilize this book. The works of its ilk are few and far between (Chinese contract law) so I was happy to come upon it. The problem, however, is that due to language barriers, much of what is written is incomprehensible. In a subject such as law where nuance and details are the key, the author/editors dropped the ball. They did little to nothing to render this work usable in any practical manner. As a matter of fact, I cobbled together other options and tried to use this as an overall guide as the author's inability to express what he wished to say with exactitude made the use of this book a liability for me."
4,I bought this CD...,"...because I couldn't find an MP3 download for the song Let It All Fall Down. Not one of James Taylor's better albums, but I liked that song and Walking Man."
1,Don't buy this,I got this with my food saver. It cracked in just a few uses. I'm not pleased with Jardian either. I was injured and can't talk when I tried to turn in a complaint by Email. They said I needed to get a friend or family member to call them on the phone in order to get help. What ever happened to equal access for the handicapped? Maybe we handicapped should take our business elsewhere.
4,"Unstackable Foodsavers, duh!","These are great savers of food. I'm only giving 4 stars because they are not ""stackable."" If you put someting on top of them, what is on top is either unstable or what on top causes the foodsaver on the bottom to lose its vacume. You would think the company would have desigend a product that allows you to stack them, or at least an inexpensive ""separator"" you could put on top of one to allow another one to sit on top of it. Duh!Thanks,Captain Tony"
4,memorable tragedy of conflict between Indians and Mexicans,"This is a surprisingly good film. Quinn is a disreputable character, who shows up in a remote town in turmoil. The local indians are raiding the town, afraid that with it authorities will impose their will on them. The townspeople are left with nothing but the church and mountain foraging. Quinn enters this imbroglio, at first mistaken for a priest, and later as a leader attempting to mediate. There is a compelling indian chief that also wants peace, but Quinn's overtures fail, much at the responsibility of angry indians, including a bitter metis, Bronson. Violence ensues.The realism is stark and moving. It is a pity this is not more widely available.Warmly recommended."
2,Not Josh Groban's Best,"Josh Groban was ""born"" with a beautiful voice. His first CD and first concert DVD were wonderful and I have them both. With ""Closer"" Groban breaks out as a songwriter too. However, he is not a talented songwriter and that should be left to the pro's. His material is dull and depressing. The highlights of this CD are Per Te, Mi Morena, and My confession. The worst is Never Let Go with Deep Forest. His choice of guests just keeps getting more wierd. This CD has a depressing look and sound. With Groban you always get the full package."
1,not what is advertised,"this item was an absoloute waste of time and money. it's advertised as 8 gauge, but it's closer to 12. the cable looks thick, but when you open it, it's all insulation. dont waste your time with this."
2,It is what it is....,"Small gauge wires, cheap, but the price was cheap to, so you get what you pay for. So far, works great. Lots of length in the cables, I used it for a boat and had feet of extra wires... Connections on the weak side along with the remote wire, super thin!We use our boat in the summer months primarily so spending a lot was not an option."
5,Streets of San Francisco,"it is so good to see this wonderful TV series coming to DVD - I am impatient to see the entire series released. Amazon, as always, sent it quickly and efficiently and I had a lovely weekend revisiting one of my all time favourite old TV shows."
3,rod saver tie downs,"I had the original rodsaver tie downs that came with my 94' skeeter bass boat. The old ones wore out. They were good quality and worked fine,so I bought the same brand. They are okay, but the quality of materials and construction is considerably less, particurly the webbing. The webbing is stiff, but thinner, and the sewing of the velcrow band is poorly located and akward to use."
5,nice,Im Pretty sure that this CD is awsome and that some of the lyrics are straight from CS Lewis. Whos a christian philosopher. So take what you want from that. But the music is sweet thats all that matters.
4,Awesome Band,"All this religious banter regarding Amazon reviews tires me. The band Thrice is not ""Christian"" but some of the mucisians are, hence the lyical content can, at times, point to Church, God and Christ. Anyway, how can one read CS Lewis and quote Lewis and not be Christian? Also, to let some of you know, Christians do say, ahem, bad words. Get over it.All that aside, the music is amazing. The guitar riffs are bombastic, the lyrics are adept and mature, and the themes are decent enough for most aging punkers to get into it."
4,Country Moo Cow,"The toy is great. It is sturdy and easy to work but the sound is not a distinct MOO. It sounds like a new born calf bleat, not the hefty MOO I expected. In any case, it was a huge hit at the event."
2,Uninteresting,"This game is a totally waste of anyone's time. The graphics are the only aspect, Police: Tactical Training made it so far and may seem like a good game. The whole game control is set up bad, for instance the scroll movements of the mouse is just a dissapointment. Personally, the game could only be liked by people who want to be a Policemen and don't care about good game feeling. Overall, I regret that I bought it and wouldn't prefer this game to anyone but ""Wanna-Be-Policemen""."
5,You cant go wrong With the Audio Source IC6s Speakers,"I just recevied my shipment of speakers and installed them all in one day. These speakers are a snap to install and drawing out your game plan is a big plus prior to installation. They sound great and for the price in my opinion, ther is not a better speaker on the market. I installed approx 11 speakers through out my house and the ambient music is great. I also used 4 of them in my den for my surround sound system they look and sound great. My nephew who installs home audio for a living turned me on to the speakers and he also feels they are the best bang for your buck. Lets just say this i have Approx $350.00 dollars invested in my whole house speaker setup and it sounds just as good or better then the model homes wich came with a builders option upgrade right around $3,000 dollars. No rocket science here."
4,"Great, but not as advertised","Good - Drive is fast, tons of space, looks good, portable.Bad - Install took a while, one-touch doesn't work, had to call tech-support and was told manual wasn't correct.Overall - For a fast, good looking drive, this is great. If you're buying it for the features (one-touch, other software), it stinks. I'm happy with mine since I use it like a huge thumb drive (drag and drop). Also, I have both a Mac and a PC. You must choose which one you're going to use it with first. My other external let me swap back and forth. Not with this one."
3,"It works, but be warned...","First off I did not order mine through Amazon. I bought it at an Apple store. I assumed incorrectly that, were there to be any problems with it, I could run it back there for a replacement. But I hadn't read the fine print--the part that said the drive could only be returned to Maxtor. When I began to use it, it made some sporadic squeaking noises (Do a Google search--it's currently happening to about a billion users) and a phone call to the company confirmed that the drive was defective. And so, $32.00 later the device was winging its way to New Mexico and I was on my way to receiving a new one, which, incidentally, also squeaks! All the pretty lights flash, both partitions show up on my desktop (a Mac), and I have had no trouble retrieving or adding files. I will keep a wary eye on it though, and rather than continuing to deposit $32.00 at the UPS store on a regular basis, I may just cut my losses and go with a different brand."
2,"Overbearing, heavy-handed,...Amis","It seems to this reader that when a wordsmith like Amis gets up a head of steam, all we know about good writing and, indeed, literature as a whole gets flung by the wayside. Smug, self-satisfied and so, well, British it's nauseating, my reading time on this one will not exceed the seven minutes I spent on it standing in the New Releases section."
1,lame collection,"What, actually is, to say it that way, philosophy of a short story. Said with a few words as possible it goes - interesting, appealing in a somwhat strange way, perverse (yes ladies and gentleman, good short story must be perverse in some manner - see Harms for instnace) and perfectly built (one must know his craft). That is just like the good theatre... There is no good one without that knack of talent that shows itself now and there.What we have here are unispired stories, written for who knows what reason, every once in a while author even outwrites himself, which leaves him in an unpleasant situation from which he can only escape by deus ex machina method.How to support something that stands for modern prose when my homelands 18th century collections of short fiction are more interesting than this ""book"".Amis may be great writer (or so I read in the other reviews around), but his greatness I am not able to comprehend... If this is greatnes, I wonder what disasterous would be..."
5,Great for those victimized by substandard dentists.,"Assemblyline dental practices or those who rec- ommend needless expensive treatment plans take heed. This book's an eye and mouth opening bles- sing which identifies to the consumer what's an all-out epidemic of substandard/fraud-based care. Dentists work for you, not the other way around."
3,"We've re-watched it, can't be that bad!","I've read some of the other reviews, and I agree that it's not a masterpiece, but the kids really enjoy it. It's colorful, and it has good messages for kids (unlike a lot of cartoons on TV). Biggest problem is that Doogal isn't likable, but many of the characters are- like the toy soldier and moose. If you can tolerate the beginning, and don't expect a classic, you may like it too."
5,My 3 year old boy LOVES it,"All of the comments that pan this movie are right on. It's cheesy, predictable, and derivative at best. There is no character development. So much so, that the plot doesn't even make sense at first. But this movie is based on a series of popular books and a resulting television series in the UK, so it's assumed the viewer already knows all about it. So the movie doesn't stand on your own... unless you're THREE. If you have a 3 year old boy who likes innocent things like Thomas the Tank Engine, this movie is for you. The most evil thing that happens is a Jon Stewart-voiced villain shoots ice out of his moustache. My son has watched this thing so many times, he's now voicing the dialogue with the actors. It's embarrassing, but it's one of our most-viewed videos in the collection, so I have to recommend it - if you have kids of course."
1,a horrible bore for the whole family,Not even my three year old liked this movie because the plot made no sense and the characters were so weakly developed. It's unbelievable that no one stopped this movie from coming out; it is such a mess. I feel bad for being so harsh - and I have never written anything like this before - but I just did not want anyone to make the disappointing mistake my family did by seeing this film. Don't waste your money or time. Not only is it boring - but it's senseless. I mean it's an insult to one's intelligence. I really disliked this movie. enough said.
5,"I'm Amazed, ""ONE OF HIS ALL-TIME BEST"", a True Underdog!!!","This Album has Depth! A Truly Enjoyable Ride! This is Not Just Metal Thrash n Crash. This has ""EVERYTHING THAT IS ALICE"", from the Funny, to the Sick, to the mesmerizing lyrics, and Music with True Musical Integrity. If your an old Alice Fan do yourself a Favor, Just Buy it! You can find it here at Amazon for next to nothing$$$ ENJOY! ScottyG.knows Good-Music!!!"
2,I dont recomend it...,"This album is not that good,I think his other albums are alot better!You will be sorry if you get it.. I warn you.."
1,I want my money back,"I think this author needs to be taken off your list. Is there anyway I can return this book? This author is a talker, not a writer."
3,Pretty good,It's a pretty good book. I thought they borrowed an awful lot from the book Bionomics and only mentioned it in passing.
5,"A Realtime ""Offer"" for coming decades.....","Just few days back started reading it after getting good review about it and it just happened that I feel like continue reading. It has the potential with exceptional examples and co-relation too parallely. Even ""Direct From Dell""'s core strength (Being Direct) is exploited and aligned with what we call now as BLUR (Connectivity * Speed * Intangible). Overall its good for those who wants to see the coming business and start acting from today in the direction aligned with BLUR."
3,"Blur is an excellent concept, but it's not a very good book.","The premise is straightforward: Changes in technology are blurring traditional boundaries, transforming simple oppositions like product and service into a new synthesis. Blur applies this kaleidoscopic view of social and business changes to commerce, management and the flow of capital.The approach is formulaic, but that's sort of the point. The Blur formula is right there on the table of contents: speed x connectivity x intangibles = blur. Well, all right. But hype x marketing opportunity x intangibles = blur, too, and that's pretty much what we've got. The authors open by asserting that Blur is much more than a book, and that belief seems to be the root of the problem. Changes in technology haven't blurred the bond between writer and reader. Davis and Meyer say they are trying to offer ""an ongoing, organic exchange of opinions."" I'd settle for a good book."
2,"One in a thousand books with the ""dah"" effect","Overall disappointing. The authors bore with generally known information that was hip in the early 90ies where it could have been called ""visionary"". Today this is just one out of thousands of books that regurgitate what kids learn in school these days. In an attempt to make the book more hip, Stan Davis and Christopher Meyer use web sites (how much general does it get than mentioning amazon.com or Peapod.com) to illustrate business models. This might be a good book if you have been asleep for the past 15 years."
4,plant mutants are everywhere,"The graphics are pretty, but not yet up to what the dreamcast is fully capablee of. however it is a good game and if there is a sequel i am sure the graphics will be better. the game is fun and interesting, the story although not really new is still well done. the camera angles are at times awkard, as is at times enemies are right on the other side of the door, attacking before the player has a chance. but for all it's faults it is a enjoyable and fun game."
1,Not Fun at All,"Sorry I think most people need drugs to find any fun in thisgame.The graphics really.. don't surpise me. its still way off ofwhat Dreamcast could really do.Only one charicter to play as.. That's stupid. Can't punch. Camera Views are THE WORST i've seen! The Bad guys are Stupid and boring.. I agree that they are Interesting looking though.STILL if you want a Zombie game go Resident Evil. I'm glade I rented this game, cause I will never BUY it! nor will I rent it again.In my Words... it is a BIG HUNK of ....!"
5,"If you can find it, get it!","Wonderful guide and background to poking in the late 50's. This book talks about the philosophy of pickpockets, the argot used, as well as social habits and jargon tendencies. Great book for anyone interested in pickpocketing or anyone who enjoys the reading of thieves.Wonderful."
4,The whole series is wonderful,"I am a big fan of all of Orson Scott Card's work. If you read the prior two books though, this one takes a turn and gets into a too much detail regarding the sexual relationship of slave owners and slaves. Abolition and this, probably the worst crime of the slavery practice, is a constant theme of Volumes III through V. I wouldn't recommend it for children that aren't mature enough to understand this."
1,From verse to worse,"Some of the ideas for these poems are whimsical and cute. However, I mourn for the lost art of versification in this country. Koontz may be a good novelist, but if he writes a line of verse that scans, it's probably by accident. The rules of prosody aren't terribly hard to learn -- why is no one bothering with them any more? Worst of all, why doesn't anybody care?Ah well. Koontz is trying to be the next Shel Silverstein, but Shel knew how to write a line that sings. Koontz doesn't."
3,"A good read, but not the best on Buffett","I wasn't expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty solid overview of Buffett's investment philosophy, with an emphasis on his portfolio management style, which Hagstrom calls Focus Investing. He defines it as:""Choose a few stocks that are likely to produce above-average returns over the long haul, concentrate the bulk of your investments in those stocks, and have the fortitude to hold steady during any short-term market gyrations.""I couldn't agree more!The book has a lot of other somewhat random but interesting stuff like a chapter on The Psychology of Investing, which is a shorter version of one of my favorite books, Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes.In short, I wouldn't recommend this book above many others on Buffett (starting with The Collected Essays of Warren Buffett), but if you've read those and just can't get enough of Buffett, this book is an enjoyable read."
5,"A great follow-up to ""The Warren Buffett Way""","This book takes you to the next level of investing like Buffett by teaching Buffett's focus investing strategy. I found it to be extremely useful, especially with the parts on other legendary investors."
5,Very Good,This a very good. I found out about it on accident. I was on youtube looking at some videos and saw a video about it. Looked it up on Amazon and ordered it instantly. Very good movie. It shows what can happen when people step outside of their marriage and the consequences.
5,Durable,"Really like the volume control option to protect child's ears. They fit even small heads and really do stay in place when adjusted. They've been ""abused"" by a 2-year-old and 4-year-old and crammed into a backpack and are still in great shape, nothing broken."
4,Good Headphones,Didn't have any of the sound quality issues others experienced. Used on the plane and off. No issues so far. Great fit for my 4 year old.
2,Seemed great,"We got these headphones for a plane trip we were taking with our toddler. They fit well, weren't uncomfortable, and it was nice to have the volume adjustment on the cord. After less than a year of having them, they just stopped working out of nowhere. Such a disappointment because they seemed wonderful. We didn't use them often, so at $20, I don't know that I'd buy them again if they won't last until the next trip."
4,"Nice but need to ""lock"" so he can't turn volume to max","Well made, comfortable and they have a long wire. A couple of notes - our 3-year old still chews the wire while watching/listening so we can't leave him alone with this (maybe by the time he's 4? Two is too young in my opinion). Also, he isn't used to them on his head so he likes to set them aside with the volume at max so he can still hear... not sure this was a good buy for us but it certainly is as good a product as I can imagine it being. I think we'll be much happier with them when he's older."
1,Not good for children,"I ordered these after doing some research on headphones for children. I wanted something for 7 year old son so he could listen to his music and Nintendo DS without hurting his ears. When I received these today I realized that I could not control the volume and they go up to 106 decibels, which can damage hearing. I tried them on and they can get way too loud. They fit decent and have the padded over the ear design that I wanted but the volume is not a safe level. I am returning them and I ordered Myphones by Griffin Technologies. They only go up to 85 decibels, which is a safe sound level. They also have the same padded over the ear design, which I like since it helps block out other noise and he doesn't have to stick anything in his ear.MyPhones Volume Control Headphones"
2,Lasted a week,We got these for my 1.5yo son to use with his computer. It lasted about a week then the wire separated where it meets the joint just before splitting to the left and right sides. This product is not durrable enough for young children to use unattended.
4,"Good, but bulky","A bit bulky and not easily stored (wanted to use it for the airplane). It fits my son's head (8mo old)...of course he didn't leave it on for long increments of time, but it was worth it when he did!"
2,My daughter's headphones broke within a month or so,"I bought 2 pairs of these headphones as the reviews sounded great overall. I have not had a problem with my 8-year-old daughter's headphones, but my 5-year-old daughter's headphones broke within about a month of using them. One side still works but the other side does not. You can wiggle the cord just right sometimes & get the nonworking side to work at times but this is rare. I agree with reviewers who state that the cords are too thin. They do not hold up to a small child. I will purchase different headphones next time."
1,Didn't work out of the package,"These headphones were a great disappointment. I was looking for headphones for my 8-year old that fit snuggly on his head and had a manual volume control. I bought these because both feautres were on these headphones. When we took them out of the box, they did not work. We even tried the additional adapter that came with them - no luck. I boxed them up and sent them back. This was a very disappointing purchase - I won't be buying this brand again."
4,Great book with some minor flaws.,"This is overall a great book. There are in-depth walkthroughs of every campaign in the game. It also analizes every civilization in the game and give strenths and weaknesses of each. The only bad things about the book are that it doesn't give many overall stratagies for all civs, and some of the individual civilization stratagies are the same for multiple civs (not very unique). For example it has both the Chinese and the Britons perofrming the Fast Feudal Rush. Other than that the book is great. All the stratagies work and work well.WELL worth the money. Buy this book!"
2,"Good attempt, but little structure","This text on Western Civ. has a good deal of information, but at times it is hard to follow. The author has a tendancy to go off on tangents on the stupidest facts. However, I would recommend the book as a supplement to a more reliable primary textbook."
2,wanted it to be more,"I really wanted to give this movie more. I liked the idea a lot. The mystery of the templars, the mystery of Russia. It was a good idea.But the script and the acting was absolutely horrible. Even the car races that they tried to use to liven up the film were not up to snuff.One of the main characters, Wolf, was so Arnold-esk in his early films that I can see him making more action films in the next 5 years. Hopefully with acting lessons under his belt. However one mystery to the film. Wolf's girlfriend. She gets kidnapped, rescued, then is in the click trying to solve the templar mystery and then we never see her again. Probably the last 30 min., she's disappeared. She was kind of a presistant and likable, terciary character, and just disappears. For a moment I thought it would get spiced up with her turning spy or double agent but nothing.Erin"
3,Wasn't Worth the Money,"I bought this camera two years ago and only used it for special occasions and it is already broke. The picture quality is just decent and the battery doesn't last that long. It has never lasted that long. The camera no longer takes pictures even after replacing the lithium battery, charging it, changing the memory card etc. I paid over $170.00 for this camera at the time and it wasn't worth it. I would save your money especially since there are much better cameras on the market today!"
2,Great size and weight. Inferior pictures.,"I'll preface this by saying I pretty much just take pictures on Auto. I'm not one to mess around with all the functions as a camera neophyte. I loved the size. Very thin and would fit into my jeans pockets easily. BUT... My mom got the Canon SD630. We went on vacation together, took identical pictures half the time, and the image quality was just SOOOO much better with the Canon. I ditched the Olympus and bought a SD750 later on, and I'm much happier with the focus, color, clarity, and especially low-light shots. Maybe you could do something with the different settings, but for a novice shooting Auto-Olympus vs Auto-Canon, pay the extra money and get the Canon."
1,Don't buy this camera,"I just sent back the second Olympus FE 190 digital camera because both of them had a defective view screen. The vendor I bought it from has come to the conclusion that the store received a defective shipment, since they order the product, and then send it out without opening the sealed carton - and since I got two in a row with the same problem, they figure the entire shipment was probably bad. The Vendor, J&R Music Store, was very nice and apologetic for my difficulties - and I have no problem with them - but I would not recommend that anybody buy this camera from any store at all through the mail."
3,"Sparks of fun will fly, but soon will be flames of bordom","to the person who is reading this, I would not recommend this of these reasons. First is the replay (how fun it could be played over again). This can be played over for a while, but soon it will be stuffed some where in the closet. One big thing that makes it not so hot is the challenge. It's to easy to beat. Even a 4 year old could beat it in a few days because that's how easy it is, and there isn't a difficulty set. Another factor that makes it bad is the controls. The controls are very tricky to control and it takes a while to get use to them. Last but not least is weapon's. I mean a game could be easy or simple to beat over and over, but if a robot game dosen't have many weapons, and stages you can't expereiment in new situations. So if I were you I would not get the game.Sincerely, a person who wants you to have fun (and to warn you of bad games)P.S. put me on the review list please!!"
4,Different approach to Christian growth,"Years ago, I did a radio interview with Professor Allen on this book.In brief compass, it offers much to ponder about the Christian life. His best contribution is in the chapter which addresses the ""eight deadly thoughts."""
3,Too Convoluted,"I think Salman Rushdie lost his way with this one and I can't say I liked it as much as An Equal Music which came out at the same time. All the same, as an Indian I think it's great when Indian writers write about subjects and locales other than their home turf, and, in this respect, readers might also want to consider Joydeep Roy-Bhattacharya's extraordinary debut novel, The Gabriel Club, set in Budapest and Vienna, which I liked very much and which is available on Amazon UK (amazon.co.uk) ADITYA CHAUHAN"
4,He's done it again,"Salman Rushdie knows how to tell stories, he knows how to enthrall his readers. The Ground Beneath His Feet is no exception, it's a colourful story about love and music, and it kept me within its magic until the last page of the book. Go ahead, read!"
2,"Dazzling language, lame story","The Ground Beneath Her Feet was written during a fairly miserable time for fiction (I can think of few really great novels from the mid 90s). Rushdie, having covered the main territories of his life - India, Pakistan, Immigration in three tour de force novels, and followed it up with the mixed Moors Last Sigh, was clearly in search of a topic. What he produced is a bunging in of a lot of high/low cultural references which was all the rage at the time, a dubious plot based on the Orpheus myth, and a lot - a lot of self indulgent passages on a questionable filigree of cultural canvas that piece together in a colourful riot of a novel, but without much grist to the mill. The characters are a sort of modern Gods Behaving Badly - a similar device used in Melanie Philip's eponymous recent novel of same name. Neither book really swings it for me I'm afraid."
4,A good first read,"This was my first Rushdie novel and I must say that it hooked me. Being a photography student I was able to relate to Rai's need to photograph and have found myself feeling the same emotions. The love Ormus had for Vina and his devotion to her was touching if not odd. I found the Vina to be a complex and completely engaging character and marveled at the ability of Rushdie to totaly engulf the reader. I was barely able to put the book down and though I loved the ending, I was sad when it was done."
5,"Joyful, exuberant, hilarious!","Rushdie's first ""American"" novel is not as narratively tight as his other-best Midnight's Chldren, nor does it have the same level of social/political commentary of Shame or Satanic Verses, but what he loses in these areas he gains tenfold in pure, joyous readability, in a lovely Nabokovian word-play and an often hilarious spontenaity of language. Reading the novel is like sitting down before an eclectic potluck dinner prepared by the best of chefs. Ironically, his first major work since the fatwa is also his most optimistic and I found myself grinning throughout, as well as breathlessly rereading some of the most finely-crafted paragraphs in modern literature. A pleasure, pure and simple."
3,"Condition poor, but still works","I was surprised at how quickly my shipment arrived, but disappointed to see that there was a very noticeable scratch down the clear screen. I know this isn't the most expensive product available, but it would still be nice to buy something new and actually have it look new. I don't think this could have been overlooked during preparation for shipment.. I almost wanted to send it back but then realized that it'll probably get scratched even more with usage. Other than that, it works fine."
5,You are Mine is GREAT!,"This CD is beautiful! We purchased this CD last month and enjoy it very much. The beautiful hymns are set to contemporary music and are new ways of listening to the hymns. I got the CD for the hymn YOU ARE MINE, but enjoy many of the other songs just as much. I rate this CD 5 stars. David Haas is a talented man, for sure."
3,Be prepared to pay a pretty penny to your CPA,"I own this update and his last book. Basically concepts are good and prose somewhat entertaining. However, here is the catcher. If you are going to use a CPA for doing all this stuff be prepared to hock your house and your family. What the CPA'S do not get the lawyers will when they charge you for setting up your FLP. I saw one bit of communication where the authors states that refiling was not worthwhile when his fees were factored in !!!!. That should tell you something. You do not believe me just call his office for a quote. This guy's has found the hoy grail of relieving most investors...opps ! i mean us traders from our profits !WHY THE HELL THE GOVT DID NOT MAKE TAXES SIMPLER IS BEYOND ME...!. trust the feds to complicate anythin they touch...!PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CPA LOBBY LIKE THE TRIAL LAWYERS AND THE NRA HAVE DEEP POCKETS TO KEEP THINGS THERE WAY."
2,Not my favorite - boring,"Thank goodness I only paid $4.99 for this! It is broken down sections with a different workout for each day of the week. I didn't really care for the cardio section and I haven't tried the toning segments. Honestly, I think the instructor looks ill and uncoordinated. I would never by another DVD from her again. After doing this once, I haven't touched it. If you are looking for DVDs with cardio and toning I would recommend The Wedding Workout from Women's Health, Shape Magazine's Transforming Workout, 30 Day Shred, or The Firm's Maximum Calorie Burn. The Lotte Berk Method is excellent for just toning and so are Tamilee's DVDs. Don't waste your time or money on this. There are better DVDs out there that are more fun and will provide the same (if not better) results."
3,From a teenagers perpective,"I like this DVD, but the only problem is that she goes ENTIRELY TOO FAST!!!! The cardio section was like trying to learn dance moves, except she didnt give instructions on how to do them and she did them too fast to even catch the hang of it. Other that its a good tape"
5,"great variety, moves are easy to learn and intense","Great variety for a fitness video, you can pick and choose the routines you want to do, you have 80+ minutes of routines that are easily taught and easy to learn; the cardio and the toning and non-traditional, which i love. If i want to lift weights, i can go to the gym, but this is not like that, it is a mix of flowly yoga, pilates, and cardio and toning moves that blend well together. YOu have to be open to learning something new, and you will be rewarded with a great, intense muscular feel, you will feel refreshed and toned. I highly recommend this dvd to all my friends at weight watchers, it is very good."
1,"Sorry, Ken, you got that one title wrong...","'cause Kenny, man, you HAVE ""sold out."" Glad to hear you're clean and sober, but what happened? And KID ROCK'S on here! That alone should be a dead give-away to anyone contemplating the purchase of this CD. Stay away, and keep playing the old stuff. Sold this one back at the used CD store already."
5,Kenny wayne rocks get over it,"this cd is absolutely awesome i own all of his cds and this one is different but its a good thing.i recently saw kenny wanye perform at a small venue he kicks some serious butt. just to let some of you know noah is still on the cd he sings a few songs himself and he is still touring with kenny wanye and the band.kenny wanye's singin is not the best, but live he sounds much better than on the cd. some of the greatest guitarist didnt have good voices, hes a talented man and you cant take that from him.anyways dont let the bad reviews stray you from buying the cd check it out for yourself personally i love it"
2,The Place You're In ~ Kenny Wayne Shepherd,"I was disappointed with this CD. I expected it to be the same driving blues sound that had become Kenny Wayne Shepherd's signiture. Instead I found that he has turned to some sort of metal step-child type music. He has matured as is evidenced by the fact that he no longer looks like a Hanson outcast. I expected his music to mature along with him and become a much more grown up version of his flavor of blues, alas it did not. Almost without exception every artist puts out a collection that is not up to par with their usual work. I hope that this collection is his only diversion from what his fans have come to expect from him. Come back Kenny we miss you!!"
2,New is not always good,I was very disappointed when I listened to the CD. The syle represented is out there by the dozen. What set KWS apart from the mainstream alternative garbage was the combination od blues/vovals and outstanding guitar playing. What is left is the guitar. The reason I gave this 2 stars is the voice of Noah Hunt on 2 songs.
2,Pretty generic...,"KWS's 4th release has abandoned blues/rock to play pretty generic hard rock. He's also singing lead vocals and he's not half-bad but there is really not much here that hasn't been done better by someone else before. There are a couple of tunes ""Be Mine"" and ""The Place You're In"" that sound like mediocre Lenny Kravitz, ""Let Go"" which open with a nice backwards guitar solo and then melts into Steve Winwood on a bad day, ""Hey, What Do You Say"" with several guitar solos lifted right off of ""Freebird"" and a semi-catchy song called ""Spank"" with Kid Rock handling guest vocals. And those are the highlights..."
2,"Looks good, works lousy","If you look at the photo carefully, notice that you cannot see the bottom half of the eraser...There is a reason why, it sucks... Not only is the eraser the color white (which looks dirty once used on colored chalk), but it is a quarter of an inch thick and the rest is the wooden handle! Well, I did not buy this for the fancy handle, I need a tool that is dependable and erases well. So I bought this for my child to use and it hardly erased. So I thought I would give it a try and had to push firmly on the board and guess what, I still see the chalk marks! Although this eraser does looks nice, it just doesn't work. Oh well, we win some and we loose some and I gotta count this purchase as a loss. I'm just glad that I didn't pay too much for it."
1,Doesn't erase!,"That's all, just doesn't work. Might work on a school chalkboard? But not on our easel. Better off using a wet paper towel"
1,Boring,"To be honest, I gave this book to my local library after 250 pages. It was just boring. I don't see how this book made it past the editor's desk. The writing style is confused and disjointed. Many times it didn't make any sense to me. There are too many other good books to read this summer!"
1,Waste of Time and Energy,"Oprah's books usually don't catch my attention, but since this was a hardcover at two bucks, I figured it might help while away the time this summer. This book is a complete and total MESS. I can't decide which is the most annoying and distracting: the pseudo-dreamlike images, the incredibly stupid names Haynes gives her characters, the time-worn ""who's the father?"" plot device, the derivitive southern gothic elements... oh I could go on and on. Usually I like to give a book the benefit of the doubt and keep reading regardless. But why I kept on til the bitter end with this one is beyond me.This book was horrible on so many levels. At two bucks, I got robbed!!"
5,A COMMANDING READING,"Oprah picked it, and so do millions of others because this powerful debut novel captivates with its truth. Set in 1956 Mississippi, with a compelling narrative that reveals characters in all their frailty and glory, Mother Of Pearl synthesizes the longings and aspirations humans share.The author speaks with a compassionate voice and actor Nan Visitor performs with a commanding one, perfectly capturing the nuances of saints and sinners alike in this memorable tale of what can happen in a single year."
2,It was okay.,"I too, found it difficult to read, but once I got three chapters into it, it seemed rather interesting. I thought it was an okay book and the only reason I read it was because of Oprah's book club. The best part of the book was the last 50 pages. Too bad, I had to waste all my time in between."
3,Caught up in Val's search for family and Canaans's Reality,"I found myself caught up with two different storylines in this book. The story is set in Petal, Mississippi in the 1950's, with Valuable Korner searching for love and family. Her mother is the town prostitute, she does not know who her father is, and she has to deal with this baggage of her family. This storyline does take many turns and Valuable finds family in a normally unlikely place. Canaan is an older black gentleman who has written a thesis ""The Reality of the Negro."" One does not find out about this reality until towards the end of the book when he goes to the library where he works during daytime hours. Canaan, a night janitor at the library, is a self-educated man. He goes to the library to read and quickly finds that he is unwelcome. This chapter of the book brings ""The Reality of the Negro"" to life for the reader. I was very much caught up in this storyline."
1,don't bother!,"i have read most of the oprah picks, and this one is one of the worst. the writing was impossibly wordy,the characters are loosely defined,and i could not follow a plot. i have been a practicing english teacher for 20 years with a master's degree in secondary reading,so i am not a stranger to recognizing quality literature. i loved white oleander and both of wally lamb's books. i hope the next book is better."
1,Basically boring and hard to follow.,"I have read most of the ""Oprah"" books and I must say, ""What was she thinking?"" when she added this one. This book has no continuity, is difficult to follow, has little-to-no character development and is, essentially, boring and uninspiring. What an incredible waste of time!"
2,Not one of Oprah's better picks!!,"I guess everyone deserves a chance to tell their story. This book was extremely confusing. It took more time to reread pages and reread pages over and over again. With this book being a summer read, it probably made summer boring for some. There were many instances when I struggled with throwing the book to the side, under the bed, even in the trash. It was almost like I needed an interpreter to help me understand what I was reading. Better luck next time Ms. Haynes."
1,Very Complicated,I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this one. Too wordy and very difficult to follow. I had to read and reread severals different times just to try and sort everyone out. I could not even finish the book. Maybe next time Oprah.
1,"All the""greatest hits"" of Southern lit but misses the mark.","There is a nagging lack of reality in Haynes characters. I feel as though I have been run through a ""greatest hits"" of Southern literature and modern conflict. The setting and characters were not l950's because they were contrived to suit the topics of Y2000 and enjoyed our hind sight. Why must we suffer through endless metaphors in modern fiction? Before she writes again, she should study. Before Oprah recommends a book, she should have her heart in her. It was obvious to me that it wasn't. Lucky for the author perhaps, but not for the reader. If there was a chance to give no stars, I would."
1,"Either you love it or hate it, y'all","Plunk me right down in the hated it, do I only have 2 thumbs-to-vote-this-drivle-down-catagory? An overwritten, over hyped piece of southern fried fiction. E-gad Oprah, what were you thinking to elevate this particular book into the mainstream? Sorry, love you, but this particular work was not ready for publication...and not worthy of your endorcement. Somebody hand me my blue edit pencil...........!"
2,"I THOUGHT I'D LOST MY MIND, UNTIL I READ OTHERS REVIEWS","I'VE JUST FINISHED THE BOOK AND FELT SO INEPT AS A READER. NOW I KNOW I WAS STRUGGLING JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I DID MORE RE-READING THAN READING, AND FELT CONSTANTLY CONFUSED. THE SPLIT PIG??? HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE, CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE REVIEW THIS FALL ON OPRAH, IT'LL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST."
1,What's With The Pig? I Stopped Reading When It Took Over.,I tried hard to get into this book and even started reading itagain from q the beginning to try to make sense of it. Too confusingand too wordy and it was a strain attempting to get into it so I stopped. I'm going to stop purchasing Oprah's book selections as they are all beginning to be about the same subject matter and oppressions suffered by the characters.
2,Good example of pretentious literature,"This book is one of the worst that I've read! It took me weeks to get through this book (compared to 2-3 days for most books). There is no unifying plot, and the writing is atrocious - the similes and metaphors seem contrived to be original, but convey no meaning. The symbolism too obscure for most readers to understand (e.g. the split pig). Many paragraphs seemed thrown in for no reason. In my opinion, the only part of the book that was interesting was the portrait of the shy, budding relationship between Valuable and Jackson. The book should have ended there. Until the end, it was hard to stay interested in the book, because it was hard to see why there was any point in describing these characters. The character descriptions were not bad, but this book had neither moving plot nor enjoyable prose, and a good book has to have at least one of these to be worthwhile."
3,Expert writing but bizarre overall,"Gorgeously-written tale of a mixed-bag of Southern characters whose lives cross paths in a manner which was, in my opinion, not fully believable, especially towards the end. I mean, you really have to stretch your imagination to believe such racial harmony as protrayed in the novel could actually have occurred in the years the story was set. Not likely. I also had a hard time buying the philosophical leanings of so many of these uneducated Southern folks, black or white. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the descriptive content, colloquial language, and overall pace of the novel--it's not boring or tedious, just a bit unrealistic."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype...,"After seeing this book on the bestsellers list and being on Oprah's book club I decided to purchase this book and see for myself. It took me longer than usual to read this book and I must say it takes a lot of patients to finish this book. I did enjoy the development of the characters and was most interested in the story of Jackson and Valuable. However, it was tiring about midway through the book and the first chapter made it hard to get interested. The writing style I often found unnecessary and didn't really have much affect on the story. Overall I glad I read the book but wouldn't recommend it."
1,I'm Giving Up Now,"I'm glad I read about 100 of the 169 reviews posted, though I wish I'd read them BEFORE I started the book. I'm on page 75 right now, and find myself avoiding picking up the book. It's extremely tedious, uninteresting, and I don't care at all about the characters. I'm an avid reader; in fact, I'm an attorney whose practice is 90% research, but I can't wade through this tome! Since I absolutely love reading southern fiction, I'm going to follow the advice of many of your reviewers and put it down now and move on to something else that I'll surely enjoy more. Thanks for the honest comments; you've saved me a lot of ""valuable"" time."
5,UNIQUE PICTURE FRAME,This is a stunning picture frame.This frame adds character to any room!I was very pleased with the quality and the price is fantastic! I first ordered one then I decided to buy two more. A great gift too!
2,Nice looking boom box - but short on performance.,"I purchased this unit mainly for its ability to play MP3 CD's. I was not expecting great sound from it but, among other things, but this unit was lacking an acceptable sound quality. The unit claims to have a bass feature to improve the ""deeper"" sound, however, you can hardly notice the difference when this feature is engaged. In addition, the MP3 CD's were not always recognized or the unit refused to play MP3's alltogether. Only after totally turning it off would it ""reset"" itself and play.Another problem with this boombox is that it takes a few seconds to recognize that CD or MP3 CD is inserted. This is more annoying than a bad function, however.I would not recommend this unit to anyone who is looking for a good quality sound. For its price, however, the unit could be a good value for an entry level system for somebody willing to sacrifice sound for the ability to play MP3's."
4,"decent sound, no output jack","I just bought this but am in the process of returning it because it has no output or headphone jack. I saw the MP3 capability as a way to tie into my regular stereo equipment so that I could leave a single CD in for a party and walk away. Obviously you need some sort of output jack for that.I tried to figure out from the online info whether or not this had such a jack, and finally decided that nobody would be dumb enough to make a boombox at this price point without a headphone jack. Wrong answer.My 5 minute test suggests the sound is decent enough though. If you don't need to tie this into any other system, it is a good buy."
1,Outrageouus price for cheap product,"The tractors are less than one inch cubes, with no moving parts. Just cheap injection molded rip offs. This game sold for $19.99, a few years ago. Now it over $84, at the time of my purchase. Nothing but price gouging, here."
2,"Pieces are fun to play with, but bad game to play.","The only fun this game has is playing with the game pieces. The game play is very boring and also, like other parents, I still am a little vague on what the rules are. If you are like my son, and wanted a Frank to play with, you can buy one on Ebay. People are making them custom, but at a high price. I suppose this game is worth the money just to play with the little tractors and Frank. But beware, the game is BORING and DULL."
4,Great way to enjoy tippin' tractors,"My 3yr old has watched Cars innumerable times. His favorite part of the movie is Frank chasing McQueen and Mater. This game is it!The pieces are small but more detailed than I expected. Frank in particular is ok. The game itself is again better than I expected (I had very low expectations). You move around the board, tipping (collecting) tractors along the way. You roll a dice to see how far to go, one side of the dice causes Frank to wake up, move to another spot. And he'll chase you back to the start if you're in the way.My 3yr old loves it. The there are numbers on the bottom of the tractors that you're supposed to add up. But thats too much work, we just count how many tractors there are, or just roll the dice and try to wake up Frank... or just play with the pieces."
2,Big Disappointment,"The second and third books in the Alvin Maker series were progressively less engaging than the original, but all ALVIN JOURNEYMAN has in common with the compelling story SEVENTH SON is the character names. This story brings us no closer to Alvin learning how to teach others to use their gifts or to build The Crystal City. Much of the book is spent on Alvin stubbornly refusing to defend himself in a protracted jailhouse scene, then a courtroom trial - not in plot or character development. Alvin, an everyman character who started out so likeable, is downright annoying in this book."
4,Another great story within a story,"I originally read this several years ago, and re-read it recently after getting the new book in the series. As I read this series as a whole, I am staring to notice that the individual stories form each book (The war in Red Prophet, the story of Arthur Stuart in Prentice Alvin, and the trial in this book) and the new characters that keep coming along, are starting to overshadow the overall story of Alvin's quest to build the Crystal City.This book started a little slowly, so I thought it might not have been as interesting as the previous books in the series, as often happens once you get this deep into a series. But with the introduction of Verily Cooper and Alvin's trial, the book really picks up the pace. I look forward to re-reading the next book (Heartfire) followed by the The Crystal City, which will hopefully conclude the series.If you've enjoyed the other books in this series, you probably won't be disappointed by this one."
3,Slow but worth it,"This novel was an interesting story to the Alvin Maker series. I did enjoy the story and the adventures that Card told but I felt that this story was a stopping point-a temporary detour as he regrouped. I felt that this tale was an attempt to finish the story he started and gather the characters he needed to reach the Crystal City.This is a very important book in the series. It introduces characters that I feel are going to be fundamental to the conclusion of the Alvin Maker series. If have been enjoying this gift from Card, you need to pick this book up and struggle through the slight lulls and finish this one."
2,Alvin Journeyman is one book too many,"Just like a great lawyer may lose an otherwise flawless case by asking one too many questions, or a great boxer may lose his place in history by fighting one too many fights, so too can a great writer ruin a great series by writing one too many books. The first three books in this series weaved a simple yet eloquently told fairytale compelling too all ages. The series should have ended there. Card bowed to the wishes of some of his fans or more likely to the pocketbook of his publisher when he wrote Alvin Journeyman. While I still consider the first three books in the series to be among the greatest science fiction I've ever read, this latest effort is childish and forced. Even that would not be so bad if it were'nt associated with a great body of work. I only completed Alvin Journeyman because of my respect for Card, but I won't be reading any more books in this series. Why, why, why do the great ones always have to write one too many?"
3,Not convinced,"Actually hurts to sit on until I got used to it. Now that I'm used to it... it's still not more comfortable than the seat by itself. I use it to cover up a tear in my car seat's upholstery, and it's better looking than most car seats I've seen.Maybe it'll prove it's worth once summer hits."
4,Cant argue with what works,"It works, I cant believe it, Quality is better than most people here are saying. I like it. : )"
2,nothing special,"Straight to the point.If you've never owned a beaded cover chances are you'll be very happy with your purchase. All beaded covers of course will give you more air and less sweat, thats a given. I already had worn out a cheap cover and needed something better. The high back feels a little different but doesn't take long to get used to. Yes, you need to buy a $10 package of little bungee cord to fit your seat like everyone says.Is it a big problem? No, grow up a little, nothing fits everything. HERES THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK... the bottom of the cushion is not wide enough. I have a 32"" waist. You can't spread your legs without being half off the cushion. They must have used a child seat seat fot their pics. DO yourself a favor and try to find width measurements before you buy. The quality is no different. Spend the extra $5 for the other one if you see it's larger and you'll be happier. FYI I'm a commercial driver going between 300-500 miles a day."
3,Comfort Bead Wood Beaded Seat Cushion,"I put this on my Prius. The skinny part fits nicely between the headrest posts. That's where I used two of the four short strings that come with this to tie it to the seat. I haven't tried to attach this to any other part of the seat. It does move around as I get in the car, so I usually just check the position prior to getting in and adjust as required. But once I'm in it's pretty comfortable. I don't get as hot in the seat during sunny days. Since I have a wide butt and shoulders I wish the wider part is wider so that all my body parts are off the seat. But it's works good enough. The overall length seems just right as it just drapes over the forward seat edge. And once I'm seated it doesn't move around the seat. The assembly seems durable enough. It looks like the manufacturer is using thicker flshing line that I've seen in other similar products. It's been on the car a couple of months now and the beads are still intact."
5,Works great!,"My husband wanted a beaded seat cushion for his pickup and loves this item. In addition to giving him much needed space from the cloth seat on hot days, the wood beads also freshened his car."
5,A favorite in our home,My 2 year old loves this book!!! I get to read it at least twice a day. We both like that it can be sung or read.
2,The Best of All Time?,"Don't you think it's overstating the facts a bit to call these the GREATEST Christian music hits EVER? To be sure, there are some great songs here, but the collection only covers a 10 or 15 year time span (with a couple of important exceptions), when the history of contemporary Christian music dates back to well over 30 years ago. Where's 2nd Chapter of Acts, Keith Green, Sandi Patti, The Winans, Twila Paris, Bryan Duncan, or any of the true pioneers of contemporary Christian music? They deserve to have representation on a CD that touts iself to represent the greatest music in the HISTORY of the contemporary Christian genre."
1,"BEST EVER??? WHERE IS PETRA, THEN????","Best ever??!! BEST EVER?!!! I CANT'T BELIEVE THIS! IF THESE SONGS ARE THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN SONGS EVER WHERE IS PETRA??? TELL ME WHERE IS THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN BAND?????!!! THIS IS MADNESS. AND ON TOP OF THAT: PLACE IN THIS WORLD???? MICHAEL W. SMITH HAS BETTER SONGS THAN THAT CHEESY BALLAD. THIS ALBUM IS LUDICROUS... WELL, AT LEAST IT HAS THE GREATEST SONG OF AMY GRANT: LEAD ME ON.BUT WHERE IS PETRA? WHERE IS PETRA???!!! WHERE IS THE GREATEST CHRISTIAN BAND?????!!!!!!"
4,I Call Upon You God,"A very powerful CD, most especially ""Mary's Canticle"". I own this CD and am always singing the Mary's Canticle. I belong to a choir and first sang it some time ago and liked it so much that I purchased a copy for myself."
4,Still Exceeds The PS2 Version,"When it comes to the Playstation there are games that have improved when they were remade for the Playstation 2 and there are games that look and play far better in the Playstation 1 version and Tetris Plus is one of them. Unlike Tetris Worlds where you may get different modes of the game it didn't feel like I got as much to offer or only so much of the feel of Tetris when I tried this game for myself. On the other hand Tetris Plus had the more colorful classic mode, the puzzle mode with 100 different puzzles not to mention the option to create and try your own puzzles and the vs. mode to test your skills against another player and all had the exact feel and challenge of tetris as I remembered it. If you want a tetris game for your Playstation this is by far still the better choice."
3,Good Overall,"I know this game was made for PS1. But I own a PS2 and you can play PS1 games, but is it for ALL PS1 games that IF played on a PS2, you cannot save it? I tried to save my progress on the game but it would always say ""There is no memory card."" When clearly, I have a memory card inserted with a lot of space in it."
4,Tetris +,"I have been buying old games that my family has really enjoyed in the past with other systems. The games are not quite the sameas the ones we played before, but they use the same strategy'sThat we had gotten used to. So they are great fun. I reallyappreciate the promt mailing of my orders. Amazon.com has beena wonderful experienc for finding what I am looking for.Thank YouJodi"
5,I love this,"This is a practical hanger holder, that personally I suggest any house should have it ,love it ,I used it almost everyday ,it does the work and it dont take to much room.I highly recommended,very happy with."
4,"Stand Still, Look Pretty","I liked the Wreckers first attempt at an album. Some of the songs were interesting, but all in all it was a pretty good CD. I do wish they had not broken up so we could have seen what they would have progressed into. Who knows what life will bring for them and us (their fans)."
5,Michelle and Jessica are awesome!,"Michelle Branch has produced another excellent album. I'm not usually a fan of country music, but I really enjoy this album. I love how it incorporates Michelle's pop/rock influence along with Jessica's country influence. Their voices sound amazing together which provides beautiful harmony. The Wreckers rock!"
5,Great Collaboration,"Great production, back up musicians definetly pros. Their singing is good (both) so is every musical composition. Michelle has the higher pitch and some song are basically rock while some have a nice country flavor. Very enjoyable album. You'll enjoy every penny spent. You'll get your kick distinguishing between who sings what song, if you do not look at who composed each song. Though being young girls, their music is very matured."
2,Not A Good Country CD,"I don't get why pop singers like to randomly make country albums. They aren't usually any good, and this one doesn't change that perception. It doesn't even sound like country accept for about 3 songs. I just thought all the songs sounded similar and like filler. ""leave the Pieces"" is the only good one and that is a pop song more than anything. A fiddle thrown in doesn't necessarily morph any song into country."
4,I love this album!!!,I bought this album because I like one of the girls (the rock girl) and I am not disappointed :) I really like this album and I hope there's more to come.
3,"Good, but...","Michelle Branch has an excellent voice and singing with Jessica Harp makes it sound even better. Their harmonies blend perfectly and they have crafted some good songs here. But...there are songs with a lot of unneccesary cursing splattered throughout it. What a waste! Well, got this CD from the library so money wasted."
5,Great combination,"The Wreckers put out a great album. Michelle Branch provides the pop side of the album while Jessica Harp provides the country side. I love all the songs. Its good to see Michelle Branch back again after her first two solo albums, both of which were good."
5,Incredible,Not a weak song on the CD - they're all winners! Arguably the best CD out this year! They're edgy... will eventually give the suits in Nashville fits. I'm looking forward to it.
5,A successful change for Michelle Branch,"I'm a big fan of all of Michelle Branch's pop/rock solo albums. I still want another solo album from Michelle, but I can't complain at all about Stand Still, Look Pretty. Largely produced by John Leventhal, the production is polished, but not slick enough to overpower the good musicianship going on here. Michelle and Jessica Harp harmonize very well because of their similar voices. Sometimes it's difficult to tell them apart. The album is quite serious, but ends up with the humorous ""Crazy People."" Without that song to lighten things up, I would have reduced the CD's rating a bit. Finally, a little of Michelle's pop and folk styles do come through on songs like the title track and ""Rain."" Great job, Michelle and Jessica!"
5,Nice design,I bought this to help keep things from sliding around in the back of my Ford Expedition. This works great as it has velcro on the bottom that holds it firmly in place (The velcro is also used to secure the strap when organizer is folded up). I tried a few other organizers but they just slid around with my stuff in them. The size is pretty good and it collapses easily.
2,trunk organizer,"This trunk organizer has velcro on the bottom to keep it from sliding around, and is a perfect size for trunk or SUV, I don't like how easy the sides fold down with the slightest pressure and stuff falls out. The wire in the side edges that were to hold it upright fell out of their slots in no time causing the edges to be far too flexible."
1,Go Back To Owning Bars,I guess riding on Ryan Adams' success really does get you somewhere. This cd ... Why? The dude can't sing & the lyrics are stupid & he sings like he is falling asleep. Or he is as bored as me. ...
4,watch opener,the product was ok but still have trouble getting backs off but maybe not the products fault may be due to arthritis in hands
4,Overall happy with tool.,It has been a great tool to work with on some watches that requires the use of such a tool.
2,Not very useful,"As one other reviewer noted, I have several watches that have no notch on the back side...they are flat. I was hoping that this tool would do the trick. Unfortunately, the tip is pointed (difficult to tell in the photo), so it's basically a knife. I've used others in the past that have a square end that is rounded off, so there are no points. I think that this is important if you want to avoid scratching your watch. The only reason why I gave this product 2 stars instead of one is because I was successful in opening one of my watches. Of course, it's one that I don't care about much. Oh well, guess I'll have to take my other watches to a jeweler and pay the piper!!"
5,Better than the Euro Tool case opener,I bought both this tool and the Euro Tool case opening knife from Amazon. This one has a slightly sharper blade edge that gets under the watch case tab better than the Euro Tool. Its flat handle also makes it easier to pry. The SE Knife I received has an orange handle.
3,"not as good as ""Beg to Differ""","Prong was the first and only group to record an album of tight, clean grind-core when they did ""Beg to Differ"" - the metal side of Godflesh. Cleansing is good music, and like the other reviewers have pointed out, a template for much of radio metal to come, but not as plainly original as ""Beg to Differ"". Who cares if Cleansing influenced Limp Bizkit - I wish they had listened to Beg instead, then maybe they would have been interesting."
5,A milestone in hard music,"Oh my did I spin this disc a lot in college. In my opinion, Prong remain a step above the typical metal/hard-core band of the 90's. I remember reading a review of this disc that criticised the songwriting abilities of the band. I just don't understand that. This disc is packed full of amazing guitar riffs. The cohesion among the three members is amazing. In fact, there are few albums I have ever heard that are tighter than this (listen to the guitar work on 'Cut-rate'). Almost every track here has a memorable lick, hypnotic almost. So perhaps the person who doesn't listen to this type of music is not bringing an appreciation for true talent in this genre to the table. Those of us who have waded thru one [bad] metal disc after another know talent when we hear it. I was hooked from the first punishing track to the last. Tell me this is not one of the best sounding albums you've ever heard in the genre? What do you expect with a producer like Terry Date?"
1,Complete Sh*T,It makes me sad that this type of garbage is called rock. It is marshmellow pop and nothing more. I hope the members of the band rot in hell because they dress and pretend to be rock stars. They make ashlee simpson music for 12 year old boys.Gives a bad name to music.
5,AMAZINGLY AWESOME,i have not perchesed Ryans cd yet but i plan to i saw him perform live on the simon mall tour and my friend has his cd i have listen to it a few times and i personally love every song i recommend his cd to everyone who enjoyes music and likes to hear about new artists and their sounds Ryan has an amazing voice and he writes his own songs and also plays the guitar in his songs so all you who like real musicians should def buy Ryans cd
5,Amazing music +hot guy = !!!!!!!,"This cd has some of the most amazing music I have ever heard. Ryan has an amazing voice and all of the songs are really inspiring. My favorite songs are True and Exit to Exit. Also, the last track on this cd is an accoustic version of his current single On the Way Down. This song displays Ryan's vocal and instumental talent. He is not just some hot boybander who decided to leave his group for his solo career where he makes he same music he used to(ahem, Justin Timberlake) Ryan Cabrera writes amazing music plus hes really hot!!"
5,&quot;Take It All Away&quot;,"Ryan Cabrera's Cd &quot;Take It All Away&quot; is awesome. I love it! Ryan is an amazing musician. I don't normally like this kind of music, but I love Ryan's Cd. The lyrics are great and the beat is really good."
4,Yum,"I really like Ryan Cabrera's work...I'm into the acoustic stuff so thats one of the reasons I like this cd. The only thing that I don't like is that my favorite song by him (Yesterday's gone) isn't on the album, that was rather dissapointing but other than that, I would recommend getting this cd. He has a pretty good voice!"
3,Hes ok,"the cd sounds pretty gay but the songs are good.....he sounds like a watered down version of Howie Day......u guys should buy Howie Day ""stop all the world now"" if u like ryan"
5,fantastic,"can't stop listening to the cd, he has great talent. his voice and lyrics are fantabulous. a must have, i'd say."
5,Best recording on Magic Flute...,"I probably have more than 10 sound track and video of Die Zauberflöte recording. For my taste, no one does Pamina better than Lucia Popp and Wolfgang Brendel as Papageno, a perfect couple. Edita Gruberova as queen confirms her fame to be worthy. Any recording with Lucia Popp in it, can't go wrong.Never really liked this opera, not as much as Don Giovanni or Marriage of Figaro, until I first hear Popp's sweet and balanced voice in this recording; now I like this opera as much as other two, but can never be comfortable with Cosi fan Tutte, no matter who makes them."
2,Didn't keep me warm,Was hoping this would be the answer to sitting long hours in a tree stand and not freezing. Didn't work.
2,Wish I had a torch.,"TWO cuts through 1/8 inch angle iron, and this thing was done. Sad for such an expensive blade."
2,A wee bit tedious,"Like a lot of the reviews on here, I was excited to read this book--my first Bear novel--and thought the premise of the plot was a great idea. But by midway through the book it became tedious and convuluted. Way too many characters to follow that don't go anywhere and aren't necessary for the good of the book. The science seems solid enough (don't listen to all those self proclaimed scientists [by the way, I'm a microbiologist] who slam it for being innaccurate or not up to their ego driven standards) but didn't really mesh with the character development or--as hard as this seems like it would be--the plot.Overall, a good idea kind of wasted. I didn't hate the book. But I wouldn't recommend. Nonetheless, I wouldn't discourage someone from reading it if they had their heart set on it."
2,Strong beginning but weak conclusion,"Darwin's Radio had a really intriguing start, compelling body, but wimpy conclusion. I really enjoyed the ""hard science"" and the conflict between politics vs science, but in the final analysis, the characters were boring and very stereotypical -I am referring specifically to Kaye & Mitch. During most of their dialog with each other, I felt as if I was reading something out of a romance novel instead of SciFi. It's a toss up which was more nauseating...Kaye's transformation from an intelligent, educated, prominent woman of science to a mere breeder, or Mitch's sudden change from anthropologist to a he-man, mr. macho type. Get real, Mr. Bear, people do not surrender their individual identities just because they happen to become parents!"
3,Darwin's Radio,"I agree with ""adidas"" comments to a point(""This book has, at its core, one of the greatest premises for a plot I've seen in ages. The prospect of evolution alongside our species. The characters are pretty well defined, with a good pace to keep you reading through the night. However, 3/4s of the way through, the pace drops"".) I would add that while the ending is less than I had hoped for while reading the book, I enjoyed reading it, and also enjoyed reading a ""medical"" that was not a ""Michael Crichton"" clone type novel."
4,Very enjoyable-and long!,"I must echo some of the other listener comments regarding some of the technical dialogue in the book: you can (and most likely will!) get lost at times. However, I had no problems with the length of the book-in fact, I look forward to the sequel, as Bear has left the ending open for this possibility. George Guidall is perhaps the most talented reader I have ever heard. His ability to separate the characters is superb.The plot of the story is original and compelling. And also gives you some insight as to how a health-related incident might actually be handled in the U.S. today.Definately recommend-but not for one sitting-this one will take you a few days or nights."
4,"""Hello, Mitch""","Hard science, not hard science - the point is it's fiction, and it's entertaining.I think the book will be perceived as better when taken in conjunction with the sequel. By itself, you don't really get to read much about ""the next stage in evolution"" beings because the majority of the book is about how the changing surfaces, and the political and social drama surrounding it.I liked it enough to buy the sequel."
3,"A neat premise, but . . .","Well, it's a neat premise, anyway. Man ""jumped"" from Neanderthal to Homo sapiens, and now evolution is about ""lurch"" forward again, but we see this as a threat (in fact, a virus). The problem is that Bear tries to pull too much ""taut suspense"" from this concept. In the end, this breathless approach does nothing to suspend the reader's disbelief and actually hinders it. Better writing would have earned this another star, but Bear is seasoned enough, and the idea is still compelling enough, to earn it a solid ""three""."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"The hard science bit of the book was somewhat entertaining, and I did enjoy the conflict of science and politics. I found most of the characters to be almost completely flat and totally uncompelling. Somehow, the more the author tries to push the characters beyond caricature and stereotype, the more stereotypical they become.The story structure was predictable. Once you figure out what's going on scientifically (usually before the supposedly brilliant scientists in the book), you have to plow through reams of inane dialog and description to get anywhere interesting. If someone wanted to borrow this book from me, I wouldn't advise against it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it."
2,It talks the talk but it doesnt do the walk,"Greg Bear is an excellent writer, with a fascina ting subject. And he's fluent in the lingo of modern biology, Unfortunately, he comes up short in understanding evolutionary theory. Hey it's supposed to be science fiction, and we all like an ambience of authenticity in our reads. But the problem is that when you lay on the authentic molecular biology lingo so thick and detailed, then outlandish but interesting plot handles become just plain silly. Greg Bear makes enough errors in his supposedly sophisticated appreciation of the biotechnology revolution that someone tra plausible scenariined in evolutionary biology haad to shake his head. Better to keep the theorizing less linked to real science than end up with a supposedly plasible scenario that upon closer examination is plain silly and is NOT supported by such theories as ""punctuated equilibrium""."
2,a textbook with characters,"I just didn't get it. I usually like ""hard"" science fiction novels, but this wasn't really a novel. It read like a textbook with a few characters dropped in. Oh, and a little sex to make it sizzle. After a while I just got tired of reading the same descriptions of clothing, faces, hair, etc. There's more to developing characters and plot than describing outfits and having characters move from point A to point B and hop in the sack every once in a while.All-in-all, this was a great disappointment to me."
1,"Good idea, lose the characters","A thought-provoking concept but Bear's overwrought style reads like a stillborn cross between a Harlequin romance novel and a Robin Cook medical potboiler. The characters are irksome, the dialogue stilted and the emotional tone pitched far too high. Bear's literary skills are no match for his ideas."
3,"Compelling idea, but doesn't deliver","Imagine a cross between the convoluted scientific theories of Michael Crichton with the thrilling medical researchers found in any of Robin Cook's medical mysteries and you will land yourself with a copy of Greg Bear's novel, Darwin's Radio. The 92-chaptered book tracks a large list of characters on their travels (and intertwining love affairs) as they attempt to research a new form of endogenous retrovirus, known as SHEVA or Herod's flu. Using a fictional disease, Bear argues that there is no way that evolution couldn't have happened, and it is still happening to this day.I enjoyed the ideas in this book, but was really uninterested in the characters and their stories. Honestly, I would have liked the book to be a quicker read with more suspense.A+ on the evolutionary theory.B- on the story"
5,Covered in spiders,"This is a great product, it was delivered on time and it is new production. I was able to treat my entire attic which was completely infested. The next day the spiders were gone and took most of their webs with them. I did lay a heavy layer on them because the can is substantial and is well worth the cost."
5,Kills all bugs!,"I buy this stuff at Lowe's, and I got it thinking it may help with the spider problem. It is the only thing I have found that I can spray around doors, floors, and windows, and leave it to work. The spiders crawl across it, make it about three feet, then I sweep them up. It works good on crickets too."
2,Pretty much useless for the big guys,"I bought this because we have an infestation of hobo and black widow spiders in our garage. So far I've found that works okay on the little house spiders, but when it comes to the big spiders that can actually hurt you it's not effective at all. Today I basically emptied half the can on a black widow - it would curl up for a bit, then uncurl and keep walking. I finally just grabbed a roll of paper towels and smashed it. Not happy with this spray at all."
2,IN MY EXPERIENCE IT DOES NOT WORK FOR TARANTULAS,"I WAS WAITING FOR A TARANTULA TO COME OUT SO I COULD TRY OUT THIS PRODUCT. I HAD ORDERED THE PRODUCT AFTER I FOUND A TARANTULA INSIDE MY HOME. WHEN I FOUND ONE IN MY GARAGE I SPRAYED AND SPRAYED THE PRODUCT AND WAITED AND WAITED AND NOTHING HAPPENED THE TARANTULA JUST RAN, I WAS HOPING THAT AT LEAST IT WOULD SLOW IT DOWN BUT IT DIDN'T SO I JUST KILLED IT WITH THE BROOM. IT MAY BE GOOD FOR OTHER SPIDERS BUT DEFINITELY NOT FOR TARANTULAS."
3,not the newer version,"I accidentally bought this thinking it was the latest version for PS3, but it's not. It's the same old version from 1989 that I used to love but no longer love. There is a newer version of this game by the exact same name (Nectaris Military Madness) for the PS3. Apparently you can only buy it thru the Playstation Store. It was released in November 2009 and I've only played the free demo, but it is a greatly updated version with much better graphics, sound, etc. Not sure why Amazon doesn't have it."
5,I love it!,"I absolutely love Kuwabara from YYH; he's my favorite character. This plushie is smaller than I thought, but it's still cute!"
3,Dimpled Balls,"This product comes in a sealed box labeled ""100 Fun ballz"", the only problem was that 95% of the balls were dimpled. I purchased these to go with the ""magic ball zone"" that included 100 playhut balls, and not one of those balls were dimpled or smushed. Needless to say, the balls will eventually get dimped as kids play, jump and fall on them, but I would prefer them to start out a little better then they came."
1,Do Not Buy From This Vendor,"The incorrect product was shipped, the balls were not packaged correctly and all 200 balls came damaged. The vendor was difficult to contact, and it took several attempts to get the situation resolved.I did contact Amazon when I could not reach the vendor, they were excellent. I had never had a problem with anything purchased from Amazon before and had not delt with Amazon Customer Service in the past, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Amazon stands behind their vendors and was more than willing to help. Thank you Amazon."
2,bad quality balls,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of these balls. Out of the 100 balls, only 19 were in good condition. The other 81 were soft and dented. The balls actually seemed to be made of two different types of plastics. Most of them were a soft, thin plastic. A few, mostly the ones in good condition, seemed to be made of a harder plastic.I contacted the manufacturer about my disappointment. A representative called me the same day she received my letter! She said I should send some balls to their warehouse and they would replace them. I'm about to do that now. I'm curious to see what the quality of those balls are.Even though the balls are dented and soft, both my 1 and 3 1/2 year olds love playing with them in their tent! They don't care at all about the shape of the balls."
1,"3"" Pit Balls","to easy to crush..some already came that way in the box...can not take the dents out of them..thought they were more like a ""spongy"" type.)like nerf)..so I think they are to expensive for the quality of the product."
4,A feel-good novel - highly recommended.,"I was attracted to this book because of its striking cover photo - a close-up of a tulip springing from the rocky ground at the foot of the magnificent and powerful Niagara Falls.The book was very well-written (in a style I aspire to write in), and the story moved along swiftly. I read it within in a couple of hours in one sitting.It was very enjoyable heartwarming story about very likable characters who help each other heal. There is a spiritual componant - Ruth is a deeply religious woman who says a personal prayer upon arising and retiring each evening. There is a theme of strong Christian values running throughout - but it is presented in a subtle, non-intrusive way.I also enjoyed the bit of Americana showcased in the classic car subplot!"
2,You Never Know with Amazon,"I ordered the hardcover editions of both Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. The Ender's Game book was great, but the Ender's Shadow was actually a paperback wrapped in a hardcover. There is a difference... primarily the ease with which one can read the book. Paperbacks are simply smaller print, and to call them one with hardcover, anything other than a paperback (possibly ""Library Binding"") is misrepresentation on the part of Amazon. I haven't even read this book yet, but Amazon gets two stars on this one. I may have to go back to buying books at the bookstores."
4,Bean rules,"Although this book is certainly not Ender's Game, it is a terrific read nonetheless. For me personally, as someone who read ender's game more than a decade ago, Ender's Shadow was particularly fun to read because i got to relive the original story and it felt new at the same time. As a side note, i've yet to read a story from this series that disappointed me."
5,a well-crafted addition to Ender's universe,"Ender's Shadow is a well-crafted companion plot that complements the original Ender saga, both by filling in details of the first installment and spinning off several new threads of its own. Although there are fewer plot surprises than in Ender's Game the additional intrigue and Bean's savage-but-fascinating origin compensate well.Bean's story is fundamentally darker than Ender's. His origins are completely unknown until the investigations of a Catholic Nun and a Battleschool Commander reveal one disturbing layer after another. It also adds a visceral counterpoint to the final battle with the Buggers and blazes a trail for Shadow of the Hegemon. One note of caution: While Ender's Shadow is worth the read in its own right I would still recommend that readers new to Ender's universe read Ender's Game first."
5,Thrilling and Intense,"I read Ender's Game in early December when my boyfriend lent me his copy. I loved the book so much that I asked my grandmother for Ender's Shadow for Christmas. This follow-up/parallel for Ender's Game is all I ever expected in a science fiction novel. It's intense at some points, yet touching in others. When Poke is killed I was in tears. When Bean learned that Achilles was in Battle School I wondered why the people had excepted him when the nun told them specifically not to. In many parts of this book, I was crying so hard I couldn't think about anything else. At the end, as in all of Card's books, I was completely satisfied and fully content."
1,Don't read this book!,"If you're considering reading Ender's Shadow, you've probably just come from reading Ender's Game, which you loved(as it should be loved). If this is at all true, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! Ender's ""Shadow"" is the character of Bean... except this Bean has nothing in common with the Bean you've met. In this version, Bean is better, smarter, and more reliable than Ender - Card has to constantly trip over himself to figure out why Bean would have said the original dialog and create reasons why he wasn't put in charge instead. None of it makes any sense, and in the process Ender is torn down, insulted, and made into a mockery of the amazing character we've all fallen in love with. Very rarely does a book make this angry, but (having read this book over 7 years ago) I am still hurt and offended that anyone, least of all his creator, would ever do something so cruel to such a beautiful character. Don't let Ender be destroyed like this - don't read this book."
1,Makes hash of the original,"I thought this book was mediocre, but I thought some things didn't feel quite right. So I checked ""parallel"" passages from Ender's Shadow and Ender's Game. That was when I realized that this book makes the original incoherent.A great example: in Ender's Game, there are some passages written from Bean's point of view. I found these passages well-written and quite powerful. There's a serious problem: Bean's internal monologue in Ender's Game is nothing - absolutely nothing - like his internal monologue in Ender's Shadow. Consequently, this book effectively destroys one of the best and most interesting characters in his original novel. There's more in this vein, but there's no point in going on endlessly.Furthermore, Ender's Shadow is chock-full of little comments that obviously have no purpose other than to patch up little holes in the original that pedantic readers complained about."
5,Not Ender's Game,"When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be a repeat of Ender's Game - same events, same characters with a few slightly different scenes thrown in for variety. The high quality of Ender's Game and a friend's recommendation were the only reasons I picked it up at all. What I discovered is that, while the timeline is the same, the events are completely different, even when they're the same events. When Ender is struggling to cope with the teachers breaking all the rules in Game, Bean is coming up with new ways to break the teachers in Shadow. Even the characters come out different - Card does an excellent job of creating one character and showing the reader how different that character can seem from two different perspectives. A definite must read."
5,Brilliant novel with minor flaws,"A few to many lectures on religion, some out-of-character dialogue from Bean (Which Card couldn't avoid because of the first book), and a few to many rambling thoughts from Bean's mind are minor flaws in an excellent read. Is it Ender's Game? No. Is it better than all that other stuff that came after Ender's Game? Yes. Card has tried hard to make the timelines work and, although a little shaky, the discussions between Ender and Bean. It is well worth the money to purchase this book. Learn a little about war tactics and philosophy while you're at it."
4,"Slightly redundant, but insightful",Although the story line is exactly the same as Ender's Game - and the ending is somewhat spoiled since you already know the outcome (at least if you've read Ender's Game) - the book remains interesting due to the unique perspective of Bean. I really enjoyed seeing the story from a different angle. Other people I have recommended the book to have skipped the parts they think they already know - but I recommend reading them. You may see something you missed before.
4,"Ender's shadow, an awesome book","Bean's world is very different than the world we know today. The world has stopped warring against each other and is united for a single cause; to defeat the aliens in the ""second invasion."" Earth was attacked by the formics and almost defeated. Since then Earth has started a Battle School Program to train the brightest young minds in our world to defend the home planet.Bean gets rescued from the streets and a murderous madman by a nun, Sister Carlotta. While taking Battle School admissions tests Bean and Sister Carlotta learn that he's incredibly brilliant. After being launched into space to live in a giant revolving wheel, Battle School, Bean learns that being incredibly smart and incredibly young is not a good recipe for making friends. In battle school Bean learns that a great responsibility is put on his shoulders. The life of the street urchin known only as ""Bean"" is fun and exciting life to read about. If you liked Ender's Game you will love Ender's Shadow."
2,Don't ruin your memory of Ender's game with this,"As great as Card was with Ender's Game, he's disappointing with this. I can only guess that this was his editor's idea to revisit the Ender series from a different point of view and that Card went along for the ride to humor the publisher. There is little suspense of course, already knowing the outcome of the main plot."
2,Super-Bean,"I sadly found this book a great disappointment. Ender was portrayed as an especially gifted boy.. a one in billion. Card now feels that he has to make Ender look ordinary next to his latest hero. It was a case of 'too good to believe' for me. I love Card's portrayals of special people.. Ender, Alvin.. they're people you would like to be.. or at least have a ton of fun watching grow and learn through challenges. But this book was a step too far. Bean is never really challenged.. it's almost as if he has this magic power that can make any problem go away. The effect is that you end up not caring because you KNOW the magic power will appear on the next page and just wash the problem away. I'd rather go read Ender's Game again."
2,And a poor shadow at that...,"For me, Ender's Game was an excellent book that was unfortunately followed with some very poor sequels. I had better hopes for Ender's Shadow, but found it to be dry, overly analytical, and showed through too much of Card's strong religious background in it's not too subtle overtones. Ender's Game is one of the best books I've read, but unless you really enjoyed its sequels, don't get the 'companion novel'"
1,Disapontment,"This is a really bad book, most probably in order to have another good book as Enders Game, he tries with this book to put everything make the first book Great as if Ender, Peter and Valentine were just regular foes that this little kid help, form the start to make a little baby that only crawls escape from a home of a janitor and survive on the rough streets of Amsterdam for a couple of years hidding on the rooftops from the bullies, is just preposterous and everything after that goes from bad to worst, by the end of the book I just didn{t know if I had to cry or laugh for this book, is a shame he destroyed Ender legacy for a few more bucks"
4,"Great book, with a new, and interesting point of view to Ender's Game book,","Great book, with a new, and interesting point of view to Ender's Game book.Only issue I had sometimes are words that needed to be correcting."
3,Two Views,"Most of this work is absolutely great. But, the parts that overlap with Ender's Game seemed a bit contrived. Card recognizes that no two people are going to view the same events the same way, but seems to spend a bit too much time defending this new story against the old. He doesn't seem to trust the reader to catch on. And at the same time, Bean seems to lose a great deal of his personality during his time at Battle School, though he regains it by the time he gets to Command School."
3,Not even close to Ender's Game,"Orson Scott Card seems to be attempting to make as mush money as possible by adding Ender's name to the title. The book really doesn't have much to do with Ender, and Bean seems like a loud-mouthed brat."
3,Ender's Shawdow,"I was very disappointed with this purchase and it's return. I purchased this book for my son for Christmas ~ he is an avid reader ~ however, my son then came home from school with a copy of Ender's Shawdow which he borrowed from the school library. My order was already in progress - and upon receipt I returned it for a refund ~ we frequently shop through Amazon ~ the disappointment came when I recieved a -0- refund ~ of which I made inquiry, and have not yet recieved a response."
3,"Basic, but ok","This pants rack is nothing fancy. It's just tube aluminum and heavy duty wire with plastic wheels. That being said, it's completely functional just not fancy. For the price it's fine. Reasonably sturdy but not beautiful just practical."
3,Worthless piece of plastic,"Okay, maybe it's not entirely worthless, but it's overpriced for what you get--which is a post-it note trivia game/dispenser. Each trivia card is actually a flimsy piece of paper; if you want to play more, you'll eventually have to buy more. I can see why they suggest playing it on short breaks because any longer and you'd quickly run through the trivia packs (they include two). The first disappointment from the makers of Cranium."
2,Western without blood or bullet holes,"It is good only if you consider yourself a real true fan of the genre and/or an admirer of John Wayne.It disappointed me because the storylines are genuinely naive, the dialogs are blunt and colorless, the scenarios are artificial to a point they don't make an effort to conceal the many flops and special de-effects. The actors looked like they were in the very start of their careers, no drama nor truthfulness in their acting, no blood, no violence, no bullet holes.You could really use your money in something more challenging, like cheesecake and popcorn for your next flick."
4,"Great, but limited","Excellent reference. Good pictures of the instrument & instrument tip. Also provides alias names, dimensions & instrument uses. If Rutherford would vastly expand this reference, to include many more instruments, this would be an essential component of any OR nurse's library."
5,"All I can say is ""WOW!""","I have known Monte Montgomery for a few years now and I can honestly say that Monte plays the guitar with more soul and feeling than any other guitar player than I have ever seen!It is amazing to see him perform live, because he sings and plays amazing guitar licks at the SAME time. If you do not have any of his CD's and you appreciate great guitar work and vocals, then you need to pick a CD. You won't regret it!"
4,OUTLAW BEARS OUTWIT MAN,"Tremendously fun read about various outlaw bears and their careers outsmarting man. Unfortunately, the story usually ends the same way, with the bear dead, but it is nice to read about a few bruins beating the overwhelming odds for a while. Many of the areas where these bears had their careers have since exterminated the grizzly, a fact which did not escape the author in the 1960's. Hubbard was ahead of his time in calling for controls on grizzly hunting and closed seasons, as he saw the looming specter of extinction before many others."
4,A satisfying vampire story with real atmosphere,"It's such a great conceit you wonder why no one's thought of it before: What would vampires do if the sun didn't rise for a month? Have a big, bloody party, of course, which is exactly what they do in the remote town of Barrow, Alaska. 30 DAYS OF NIGHT is a compact, well-told story about a horrific vampire invasion. The local cops, a likeable husband and wife team, have to figure out a way to stem the slaughter during the looong Alaskan night. Writer Steve Niles and artist Ben Templesmith give us suffering, sacrifice and heroism within a classic vampire-story framework, inviting comparison to Stephen King's superb 'SALEM'S LOT. Templesmith's art is an acquired taste. It takes a while to parse his stylistic language, but once you ""get"" it, the story really comes alive (so to speak). Recommended."
4,A solid graphic novel,I enjoyed the story and artwork of the novel. At times the artwork was difficult to tell what was going on but overall it fit the mood and environment of the story and I think that's extremely important. The writing wasn't that bad overall but it could have been better. There were times when things were said that were laughable. I did think it was a lot better then the movie. For some reason I thought the movie was rather lame and was upset cause it had so much potential. I'm definitely looking forward to getting the sequels to this book.
5,great story,cool idea. cant wait to see the movie! its an easy read with UNBELEVABLE drawings and paintings! sooooo cool
3,More hype than content.,"The premise is not that original and the story is pretty thin. It was not a bad book, it just did not live up to the description of the professional reviewers. I grew up reading dime store comics and found them more engrossing and with more story then this particular ""Graphic Novel"", stressing the term Novel, actually stretching the term Novel."
3,"All style, little substance","First, the good points: The art is absolutely amazing. Ben Templesmith combines Bill Sienkewicz and Dave McKean strokes to create an eerie atmosphere for the story. The concept is excellent too, a group of vampires invading a small town covered by a month of night (How come Finland doesn't have it's share of famous vampire stories?). However, the way it is written failed to exploit the intriguing plot concept. It all seemed shallow and it became unoriginal. There are also glaring loopholes: Like for a small town, how come the vampires needed a month to wipe them all out? Wouldn't the vampires overrun the town by the 1st week? For a small town, there seemed to be too many people. The description is correct - it's like Night of The Living Dead redux, all because it seemed like a B-movie."
4,Good read,"I thought it was a good read. Interesting story. Definitely dark and creepy, which only add to the over all story. I felt it was too short, but that's how they got me to buy the other ones. All and all, i liked it."
5,Indian Motorcycle Memories,This is a really interesting and informative DVD on the history of Indian Motorcycles using vintage photos and film. It even caught my wife's attention who doesn't particularly care about bikes other than just riding. Highly recommended viewing! Thank you for quick service.
4,Still my favourite folk/rock band,"I have loved Steeleye Span since the mid 70's when I first heard Gaudete on the radio. Yes, their sound has changed over the years, and with whatever configuration they were playing at any given time. Somehow though, they always stay recognizable. Gay Woods is not Maddy Prior, but so what. She is a founding member of the band, and that seems to have brought them full circle in their music, back to more traditional interpretations of well-known songs."
2,Too small!,"This product is being retunred because it does not match the description on the web site. It's much, much smaller than what it claims to be. I can't really comment of comfort because I couldn't get it around my fat belly to properly evaluate."
1,Pigs in Heaven,Book was sold as new but was obviously used with markings on the back cover showing a price of $5.00. I paid more than that. This is not an honest company.
1,quite possibly the worst book ever written,"This is the kind of book teachers try to force upon students, making them experience this horror. This is the very worst of anything possible, I would buy all the copies and burn them if I could, but too bad I'm not that ric, so I must plea to you: BURN YOUR COPY BEFORE ITS TOO LATE"
4,"MY THOUGHTS ON ""PIGS IN HEAVEN""","""Pigs In Heaven"" was given to me by a friend of whom I have known for 5 months but yet admire this person dearly. ""PIGS IN HEAVEN"" was a ""GREAT"" book and Kingsolver can make one feel apart of the book as you read. I really recommend this book if you are the type of reader who can connect with the characters as you read. So I hope all of you can take the time to read on of Barbara Kinsolvers books and enjoy it as much as I have!"
2,Disapointed,"Pigs in Heaven was the first Kingsolver novel I read, and I was disapointed. Although the first couple chapters pulled me in, the development of the plot and characters seemed contrived, unrealistic and flat. Turtle was an exception -- I thought her interesting and better developed than the other characters. The plot kept me off guard, and didn't seem to flow naturally and the conclusion, although I love happy endings, seemed unrealistic and abrupt."
3,Recommended Only As A Sequel To The Bean Trees,"Pigs In Heaven is a ""must read"" only if you have already read her novel, The Bean Trees. From a critical aspect, Pigs In Heaven is a rather disappointing piece of work with a predictable story line and contrived ending. However, The Bean Trees was such an enjoyable and original novel about Taylor, the single young woman who ""accidently"" adopts a Cherokee toddler, Turtle, that the fans of that book will want to wade through this sequel to see how Taylor and Turtle have their happy ending. However, the writing seems rushed, thrown together, and I actually found myself skipping through whole paragraphs to finish up the obvious story line.By far, not Kingsolver's best work. She is capable of much more. Hopefully, readers will not judge her by Pigs In Heaven, and will read The Bean Trees first. And as an aside, neither of these books come close to her ""Poisonwood Bible"" in terms of literary excellence."
3,well written and informative,"Although Kingsolver's voice in this novel is less mature and a little more awkward than it is in her masterpiece, Poisonwood Bible, I would still urge readers to read this book. I don't think she wrote this book at the ""expense"" of the Indian Act. She wrote it to increase public awareness and show how this act has touched the lives of individual people. The characters are sharp and endearing."
4,"Good, But Possibly Convenient","I liked this sequel to ""The Bean Trees"" very much. I thought Taylor's dilemma was heart-wrenching and that the outcome would be devastating. However, a convenient relationship ends up saving the day. This made me feel good for Taylor, but it also made me feel that such an outcome was contrived for the sake of a satisfying ending. I still give this book 4 stars because the writing is powerful and the dilemma gripping."
4,Predictable But Thought Provoking,"_Pigs In Heaven_ by Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful book, excellent for relaxation and quick reading. Having read several other Kingsolver novels, I would have to say that this would not be listed as my favorite one. While I loved the plot line, as well as the mystery of Turtle's birth, I felt that the reader could figure out the ending early on in the course of the story. Possibly the reason for this predictability lies in the fact that I know how Kingsolver weaves her story lines together (as she does so well in _Prodigal Summer_.) Some of the characters are less developed than others, but the reader can't help but become enraptured with Jax, the musician, Turtle, the Cherokee child found in a car, and her adoptive mother, Taylor Greer. This is a good beach novel, filled with tidbits of Native American facts and myths. I love the title (related to Native American mythology), and I continue to ponder its relationship to the novel as a whole. Enjoy!!!!"
3,Not her best,"This book just didn't live up to The Poisonwood Bible in terms of character development and plot line. That said, there is some very interesting background about the Native American struggle to regain their cultural heritage and how that plays out against other challenges their tribes are facing. The storyline didn't seem very realistic to me (altough perhaps it is, given Kingsolver's penchant for detailed research)which was somewhat disappointing. She's an excellent writer but if you're only going to read one of her novels, this isn't it."
5,GREAT READ!!!,One of my favorite books. books I happen to enjoy this author very much and would anything she writes. I would also recommend her writings to anyone who likes to read. There are many topics from Barbara Kingsolver to fulfill your reading hunger. ENJOY!!
3,Nice scissors,"These are a nice pair of scissors, but just a little too stiff. Hope it will loosen up over time."
2,Seems like self therapy,This book drove me crazy. It seems to me like she's doing some self therapy and taking us along for the ride. I could have done with just the story and less analysis. She really beats herself up. both her dad and her cat lived long full lives. How can she dwell on how to bring them back and ignore her blessings with the time she had with them. Ahh too much.
5,Another Great book from Geneen Roth,"I loved this book. It is so smart and entertaining and insightful, and yet also hilarious. I recognized a lot of my own life in her story of the (male) cat Blanche, who was with her every step of the way when her life came crashing down. I think Roth is brilliant, and I learned a lot spiritually and psychologically about life."
5,My Favorite Author for a reason....,"Geneen Roth is one of but a handful of writers who I will purchase a book she wrote sight unseen. She has a way with words, and thoughts and feelings that is beautiful and insightful and touching. This book did not disappoint. Having lost my mother a few years ago, and getting to the age where I realize life is fleeting, the message was very timely for me. Anyone who ever lost (and who has drawn a breath that hasn't?)something or someone they loved will surely relate to the well of feelings that are exposed here. I couldn't put it down....read it cover to cover and will go back with my highlighter pen for passages I want to revisit often. Reading Geneen is like being with a best friend. A very wise and loving best friend."
4,Not easy to put together,This firetruck was almost impossible to put together. There were severalholes that were not punched through and my husband had to use a drill topunch through the plastic. Luckily we did not wait until Christmas Eve toput this together.My son loves to play with it but they need to make assembly easier.Quality control should have caught holes that were not perforated.
3,An Involving Puzzle,"Bought this as a gift for my sister. It is one of the foam puzzles, so it is not very durable. The instructions are in black and white, could be better in color. However, my sister loves it......"
5,FEEL-GOOD COP MOVIE,"I first saw this movie on the IFC cable channel and watched it every time I could find it. Since they didn't show it often, I had to be looking for it. I just had to own it, it's just that good. Kind of a buddy film but moves and Mike Doughty's music really helps set the mood."
1,AMY X NEUBURG / RESIDUE,"Alright, got the hype on this from AMAZON recommendations. Anyone that is great in the Bay area, right? I don't get it. The voice sounds strong from time to time in the CD but it must be way over my head otherwise. I actually don't like most every cut on the CD. From the reviews it looks like I am way off most other folks, so try the preview first, listen closely. But if you like lovely singers go cautiously here."
1,This is crap.,"Don't waste your money and time on this junk. I bought 2 100 spindles, I got 15 consecutive coasters from my first spindles. I thought it was just my luck with the first spindle, then I got another 10 coasters from the second spindle. 100% failure rate, incredible!!!!!!!!DON'T buy!!!!!!!!!LANDFILLED MATERIAL!!!!!!!!!!!! JUNK!!!!!!!! TRASH!!!!!!!!"
5,Adorable!,"I decided on a jungle safari theme for the nursery, and bought Dangles the monkey, along with Winks the elephant, and Tiptop the giraffe, for my son, who isn't born yet (I'm due in about 7 weeks, now). Unfortunately, sellers on Amazon.com wanted $45 for Catnap the lion. I was, therefore, very excited when I found Catnap at a local toy store for only $7. I love that Pluffies are safe for all ages (I was surprised to find many stuffed animals are not) and machine washable, not to mention adorable! I'm sure my son will love them as much as I do."
3,No Power?,"Product was in good working order with usb connection. However, there was no 5v, 2amp power cord to plug in. Thats pretty crappy in my estimation. Otherwise the item did work as intended.(once a power cable was located!)"
5,Ness and the boys closing in and fast !!!!!!,"With the first half of the untouchables out ,and watching all the episodes left me wanting more from that first season. Robert Stack played the part as Ness great as can be plus the guest star actors and Winchell's narration add great credibility for the show. I recall a tv station here in the San Francisco Bay Area KOFY TV20 would show the untouchables in reruns during the day and at night but different episodes sometimes there would be a untouchables marathons for two whole days 48 hours of Ness and the boys slugg'in it out with Capone and the gang in the streets of Chicago."
4,Help! I've been brainwashed by Richard Belzer!,"Well this is it. We have found a book that may convince us all that there is much more to it behind the killing of JFK, government's attempt to blind us from ufo and Belzer's wit. I was in the bookstore and took a peek at this book. I was only going to read the introductory but instead I became facsinated and ended up reading the whole thing all the way. If I haven't read it, I would've bought the book. This book has all the information we, american citizens, deserve to know."
5,A great oldie goldie.,I remember playing with one of these as a child and they are timeless. Just had to get one for my grandson and he loves it.
4,COOL BUT CREEPY,I got this for christmas. I didnt really play with it. Once i asked it if my cat was going to scrath my brother it said it is certian then like a minute later my cat started scrathing my brother. Me and my brother thought that was wierd then after that when my brother was on the computer i asked if the computer would stop working and it said without a doubt. Then the computer kept saying stack overload then shutdown. I thought it was weird. My brother thought it was scary.overall 4/5 it hasnet given me any bad luck.I dont know if yours will predict the future right. The only way to find out is to buy it.P.S I asked it if it could predict the future it said yes.
1,Not so Magical!,"I bought two of these Magic eight balls. One for me and a gift for someone. The package reach on time, but to my dismay and anger, the window where you are suppose to view the answer is clouded up you can't see anything, it's two that I bought and it's the same with the two. This was really really disappointing. Anyone out there, a warning. Do not buy this item."
1,Morons take advice from a plastic object,"This is really abrupt and childish taking advice from a plastic 8Ball. Like, we would care? No.This ball is obviously has blue-dyed liquid inside with triangular sides that probably make up a three dimensional hexagon. Grow up, people. A ball of plastic that holds liquid would never be damn right to ask questions, infact nobody and no-one can ever or will predict questions.This toy should stay on the shelves when everyone starts to be loyal and by using this hunk-of-[...] gets you dumber every question you answer it. The shrewd kid that wrote a review backthat was something like 'Form of Idolatry. This is wrong' is positively right."
1,Did not work,"I was very disappointed with my first experience with Amazon.com. I ordered this item with great expectations to present it as a gag gift to our Medical director at a roast in his honor. When it arrived it did not work. No matter how much I shook it,the message did not float up to the window on the bottom. Since the party was 48 hrs away I did not have time to send it back.It was a dud."
1,Decisions Made Easy!,"I have a Magic 8 Ball and a Staples ""easy"" button on my desk. I tell visitors that I make all of my decisions using both the 8 ball & easy button. A great ice breaker, but unfortunately, my 8 ball is wearing out. I got it as a promotional gift, so I suspect it's not a genuine Mattel. Time to order another!Update: After less than a year, my 8 ball has ceased to work. The messages weren't the clearest to begin with, but now you can't read them at all.My advice? Go to Toy's R Us & buy one that works."
1,Don't buy!!!,"I bought this to charge my Zen while camping. Worked when it arrived. Didn't work when I left for vacation. I know its cheap, but I expect even cheap products to work more than once."
4,Fast Charger,"I needed a car charger for a long trip for my creative zen, and at the creative store this charger was more expensive. This charger came with a home charger as well, and it chargers 10x faster than plugging into the computer. I love it."
2,Cheep,"Well, I got what I paid for I suppose. I wanted to spend less money for a Zen Vision M car charger and A/C charger, and opted for this package deal. So far, the A/C charger has worked fine. The car charger, on the other hand, fell apart when I pulled the cord instead of the handle - my bad. I put it together and it continued to work - for a while. Then one day it decided to stop working altogether."
3,"It was all right, but some things were unrealistic.","This book was something of a disappointment to me. Many of the suggestions in this book were very good. Others, however, were simply unrealistic for anyone with any kind of a 'romantic budget.' I was looking for simple, heartfelt ways to say I love you...and this book mostly provided ideas of things to buy and ways to spend money on your lover."
4,Very convenient but lacks speaker/mic connectors,"I really like the convenience of being able to route all the cables and hide them better by using this docking station. It installed fine with my Vaio VGN-SZ430N (Vista Business). I don't give it five stars because I am disapointed that it doesn't have the speaker/mic connectors on the docking station, it would also be convenient to have two VGA connectors instead of one DVI-D and one VGA, DVI-D cables are EXPENSIVE and they usually don't come standard with LCD monitors."
4,Good product,"This product is pretty straightforward. Provides an easy to use docking station for a Sony Vaio laptop. The only complaint I'd have is that it is not as easy to dock as in previous versions of the same product. But, it is functional and gets the job done."
2,Half hearted attempt,1) Multi monitor software is poor. Manual configuration of external monitor is required on every re-connect. Dual monitor (using the laptop screen and an external monitor) does not seem to be supported.2) Analog video quality is poor. Dock seems to degrade the signals.3) No power supply included.4) No provision for audio.5) Only three USB ports
3,sz docking station,"For the price I would have expected to receive an additional power supply with the new docking station. Its a real pain having to reconnect the power supply that was supplied with the laptop and I will probably end up buying another power supply. IBM docking stations include a new power supply. The Sony docking station does not add all of the functionality I was hoping for. Most printers now use USB, but no parallel port included. No connections for sound systems either. I will probably run out of USB ports and have to buy a hub. I'm not sure that the laptop is being charged in the dock with the power turned off?"
1,Hopeless for me,"I really wanted to buy this dock,but after reading fewreviews here it is a no go for me. You can't switch on or off the comp on docking station. I called SONYand they told me there is no other way to power on the mashine- only by opening the lid and pressing the power button.No audio out.C'mon sony, was it so hard? It defeats the very purpose of expansion dock- you still have to connect external speakers to laptop because VGA and DVI don't carry audio signals.The sz series is a well build machine with two video chipsets (INTEL and NVIDIA),but docking station is a joke."
4,Fun series!,Another great part of the series. Entertaining to read with all the spy espionage. I read them all and tried to do it in order which makes it more fun.
1,Beware: color not at all as pictured,"This shawl is neither dark nor lilac, but rather a Crayola-hued purple with neon undertones. Looks... cheap. It is also not really shawl or wrap-sized, more accurately it's a large (though insufficiently long for some uses) scarf."
5,Essential for Pilots,The current version of this book is of course a must for all pilots. It contains pertinent FAR's and a good synopsis of aeronautical information for the civilian pilot.
5,Soulstepping: African American Step Shows,I wanted to know was this the book I was looking for and it was. Also the product was in excellent condition as described.
5,This can happen to you!,"This was an amazing book. I was well writen and I'm sure an acurate account of some of the best rolls of all time (to present). Mr. Scoblete hardly mentioned the amounts of money that he won in his exploits, which gave more credit to the book. Interesting people in an art that is just becoming popular. To me this is a ground floor opportunity and I fully intend to take advantage of anything that these skilled men have to teach me. Money well spent!"
5,Foarm-This is the case to get to protect your Garmin GPS,UPDATE: 3-22-2008 I'm still glad I found this. Much better than anything on the market. My GPS has been dropped numerous times and it is nick free. The soft rubber absorbs the impact. I notice that Amazon has associated this review to the camo printed case. I have the all-black case and I have no idea why I can no longer find the black case anymore on here. I really doubt the black was discontinued and replaced with a camo design.Original review:I stumbled over this while looking for the Garmin brand GPS case. I'm glad I found the Foarm brand one. It is the best protection when the GPS gets dropped on hard surfaces or in the water. Your GPS will still float! Fits like a wetsuit. Comes with replaceable protective overlay for the display. I suggest getting others (for PDAs) and use the one included as a template. Integrated lanyard and safety clip. The pefect design. ...and you will drop it!
4,Good set - Disks are Full-Screen,"Note: The product description on this page says widescreen, but the set is all full-screen (marked on the box and on each disk). Since these were all made for TV (pre-high-def), that shouldn't be a surprise, but just in case anybody saw the mistake on the page, I don't want you to be disappointed.As far as the content, there are plenty of other reviews that nailed it. 'The Stand' is a must-see, and 'The Langoliers' isn't bad."
4,Stephen King Gift Set,"The Langoliers was entertaining. I loved The Stand. Golden years was slow to start out, but the 2nd half of the movie was good."
1,CD's were scratched and some unusable,Was very disappointed-Will order it again new when I have the money!!! Hard to watch half a movie and not be able to watch the other half.
3,"worth a look, but don't buy","I was able to borrow this book through the library as I was not willing to purchase due to some of the reviews here.The recipes for donuts are intriguing-really the only thing truly notable about the book. All the rest of the recipes are standard and uninspired.Although a couple of cake photos are really pretty, I wasn't as impressed with them as some of the other reviewers. I thought there were too many flowers in most of the designs. The whole cake section in general was totally flawed."
5,An under appreciated gem,"One of the funniest sitcoms I have seen, real sad it went largely unnoticed and under appreciated. If you have the chance to pick this up do so without hesitation."
5,Fun Videos,This is a zany video that is so fun to watch. Purchased used copy from Amazon.com. Watched this with my grown children and grndchildren
5,"It's not just about OJ, but all black men in America!!","Looking for a book you literally can't put down?Even though the 1995 OJ/Brown/Goldman tragedy is well behind us (or should be), racism continues to plague American society. Why?It didn't begin with OJ and unfortunately will not end with his story. Dr. Hutchinson's mountain of research weaves together the compelling stories of OJ, boxer Jack Johnson, Iron Mike Tyson, tennis great Arthur Ashe, superstar Michael Jackson, basketball/baseball's Michael Jordan, and even multi-millionaire Magic Johnson. Is there no escape for a black man accused of improprieties? Dr. Hutchinson contends that neither money, fame, nor professional connects will shield a carefully protected, and long-held pristine reputation once accusations or unfounded rumors begin to fly. Dr. Hutchinson also dissects the disparity between media treatment of blacks and whites, and pinpoints how television news, newspapers, and national magazines add fuel to the smoldering tinderbox."
2,No good for beginners,"As a semi-experienced C++ programmer, I found this book utterly useless. The book contains no full working program examples. What code is offered is so out-of-context as to be indecypherable. It makes no effort to get you up and running quickly.Definately of no use to someone who doesn't already know almost everything about C++ in Symbian OS. So, useless to everybody except academics and Symbian employees! If you do buy this anyway, prepare to read the whole book through 3 times, spend a lifetime in the forums and a fortune on coffee and headache pills, before you can approach a semblance of reasonable proficiency.A beginners' book is due to be published in October 2005 by Symbian Press. Till then, stick with Java for mobile development unless your life depends upon it."
3,Great bargain treat!,"My basenji, Lily, loves Rawhide Munchy Sticks Beef 5"" 100 Pack and Chicken, 5"" 100 Pack best, but these are a great deal and she will chew happily on these as well. I guess she is not too picky."
1,Not worth the money.,"Old story. Told hundreds of times. Why does it seem unique just because its the first time the writers experienced building a bike?Its like very pregnant mother needs to start a blog and discuss her childbirth. Seriously!? Do men have to do the same thing, just because they got their 1st chopper?Boring. Slow. Same thing told on one of a 100 different shows on TV or cable.Not worth the money to buy.Spend the $20 and go to a local bike night. Chat with some real people. Get a couple beers. Way better than buying this movie."
3,"i liked it, but it stopped working right away","good design, feels good in the hand. but about the third time i turned it on it made a popping noise, there was a little flash, the display went out, and it wouldn't turn off. i returned it, but i wish it had worked."
1,HC701 - Buyer Beware...,"Although the IDEA of this cutter/trimmer is great, with battery power and multiple settings adjusted by a push of a button, the product is VERY sketchy. Seriously reconsider when deciding on it.I have had 3 now in the course of 2 months. First one was DOA, so I exchanged it for another. The 2nd one worked a couple of times, then it shut off on it's own, then turned on by itself, and I could not subsequently shut it back off. Called Conair - which was a terrible experience, with hold times of >20 minutes (thank goodness for speakerphone...) - and they gave me an RMA for an exchange. Free? Hardly. I needed to pay shipping BOTH WAYS (Sent them a check with trimmer #2). Got the new one today in the mail. Does it work? NO. I'm done. Good thing I kept my plug-in Wahl trimmer..."
1,A very terrible product!,"I went to get the swiffer sweeper vac and ended up buying this. I thought wow, what a good idea. You can vac and mop with one product. NO WAY it does not work! I filled up the tank and when I placed it on the mop the whole tank spilled out. Ok, I thought it was just my fault so I did it again. Same thing. When I finally got some of the water to stay in the tank, I mopped. Oh my, terrible.....the water gets into the vac canister, and all it does is push around the dirt. It streaks badly and that cloth you get with it doesn't come clean. The only positive is the way it vacs stuff up, but it is not worth keeping it for just that. I am taking it back, after everything DRIES."
1,A Waste,"I bought this book hoping that Lucky's book has good overview and comprehensive review about progressive rock. This book contains 50 bands which were considered the best or at least the bands that gave influence to other bands in the progressive rock history. Each band has pictures, short biography and a list of discography. I can tell you guys and gals that those information can be found in those bands' websites. Lucky did nothing new, no further observation, no reviews, not even a subjective opinion about those bands. There is no need for us to buy a book, when the information is EXACTLY what can be found on the internet. From all progressive rock-related merchandises (books, CDs, vinyls, tapes, videos, DVD/LD, posters, etc), this is the worst product I ever have."
5,A Good Overview of Progressive Rock,"This book profiles what Mr. Lucky considers to be the 50 most influential and important progressive rock bands. He includes the superstars (e.g., ELP, Jethro Tull, Yes), the obscure (e.g., Omega, Ange), and the modern (e.g., IQ, Cast, Anglagard). I am glad to see Mr. Lucky include some bands from the 1980's and 1990's, as many fans of progressive rock seem to think the genre effectively ended in 1975. It is also nice to read something positive about progressive rock for a change. There are photos of almost all the bands, including 13 color photographs. If you like progressive rock (I know there are at least a few of you out there), you should buy this book. In addition, you may be interested in another book by Jerry Lucky, ""The Progressive Rock Files,"" which is available from Amazon."
5,Excellent,"Perfect, awesome quality and does what it is supposed too. Very refreshing to get something that just works! It is doing what it is intended to. Traxxas quality is great."
4,Stable,"Bought the wheelie bar for my nephew . He has the traxxas stampede .the truck has so much torque it kept doing wheelies .thought it might be time for a wheelie bar.we received the wheelie bar very quickly and after it was installed ,no more problems with back flipping and stability is great."
4,Worth the money...... but........,"This wheelie bar is almost a necessity. It really helps with flipping the car, but, it does come unsnapped fairly easily. Still, it rarely flips, just have to keep putting the two pieces back together. No big deal, but, wish it was a little more of a secure way to keep 'em together."
3,Don't Fit Over Glasses,"I purchased these goggles because they were OTG or Over the Glasses type goggles. In short, they do not fit over my glasses. I wear a pair of thin framed glasses and I don't feel that I have an abnormally large head. I wear a medium in both street and dirt helmets. I was using a pair of non otg goggles before this that fit better. The reason I rated this 3 stars was because I can't fault the product, just the fit, the quality of this product appears to be of quality, came with an extra tinted lense and detachable nose piece. The packaging was spot on for this type of item, really no complaints other than the fact that they didn't fit over my glasses. I have already returned the item to Amazon (where I purchased) and they are great for returns."
2,Raw,"If you're a Tull cultist you should get this album, but for anyone else it's just not a good effort: sloppy, rough, amateurish (Ian learned to play the flute a few months before cutting the album). The album's title seems to indicate that the band knew this and that they wanted to move past it. If you want some early Tull, get ""Stand Up"" instead. The musicianship and arrangements are better and Tull had developed its musical concept more fully, instead of being just another Brit wannabe blues band."
4,great early Tull,"a must have for any Tull addict. Early Tull is great, but I like benefit and Stand Up better"
3,Blues with a tinge of Tull,"Presciently titled, the album showcases where Tull came from and hints at where they were to go. The rousing My Sunday Feeling and the jazzy Beggar's Farm are almost classic Tull, while the more standard blues tracks---Someday the Sun Won't Shine for You, Move on Alone, It's Breaking Me Up---are imbued with Ian Anderson's sense of humor. Serenade to a Cuckoo is important because it is Ian's first flute tune, Cat's Squirrel is for Mick Abraham purists, but the masterpiece is Clive Bunker's drum work in Dharma for One---pristine."
3,Its not very good,None of the remixes are any good and the radio edit isn't as good as the album version - buy the album - RAY OF LIGHT
2,"Stylush, yeah, BUT",But its got really poor sound quality and the top was already broken when I opened the box. Although I do have to say that my friend got one and is very impressed with it. I would probably not recommend it but I would take a chance at getting it considering the fact that my friends works fine. Mine was probably was just handled the wrong way.
5,Jezebel Today,"The culprit in disguise is easily recognized as the reader flies over the pages of Jezebel vs. Elijah. In her book, Dr. Keyton challenges her readers to action as she boldly exposes the spirit of Jezebel in both the church and in America today. Her work is generously supported with scripture and she does an excellent job defining the problem and presenting a solution. Good read."
5,"Clearly written, good diagrams, interesting illustrations","When you thumb through this book, your are immediately impressed with the lighting subjects included. Many are not the usual cliches found in books of this type. The diagrams and text are clear and easy to understand. Good book, glad I bought it."
1,Don't Bother,"I thought that this book would make it easier to pick out a tattoo design but it sucks. It has a bunch of drawings that are so basic. I thought that it would have cool tattoo pictures like the cover, but it doesn't. I think this book should be left on the shelf."
4,Take Charge of Your Own Health!,"Dr. Gary Null has written a book of alternative therapies for 71 conditions, including:- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome- Digestive Disorders- Eye Disorders- Foot and Leg Problems- High Cholesterol Level- Osteoporosis- Parasites- Skin ConditionsThis book covers the use of 25 different alternative therapies, including:- herbs,- supplements & vitamins,- aromatherapy,- chleation therapy- enzyme therapy- Alexander therapy- oxygen therapies- Ayurvedic medicineMy favorite part of the book: the causes of those 71 conditions are explained clearly -- in layman's terms. Then Dr. Null gives a variety of alternative therapies and in what doses they would work most effectively.I found the explanations to be clear and easy to follow. The author gives enough information to be helpful, without bogging the reader down in extra medical words and explanations."
1,Memorex errors in recording and finalizing,I've used a number of different brands with my Panasonic DVD recorder....this is the only brand I've had problems with - between 15% and 25% result in failure - I've had zero problems with other brands. Can't recommend.
2,Typical R&B Album,"Although I like ""Never Find Someone Like You"", the other tracks on this album sounds very typical and similar to a ton of other R&B ballads. Something just doesn't capture my attention on this album. Most R&B stars have a unique sound/voice that makes you recognize them immediately, but that simply isn't the case for Keith Martin. Although he doesn't have a bad voice, he doesn't sound original enough for me. It's hard to distinguish him from any other R&B singer, or someone that you catch in a kareoke bar surprisingly belting out a smooth slow jam."
5,Talent,Wassup ya'll Keith Martin's first c.d. was tight. He is very talented. But if ya'll liked his 1st c.d. get ready for his 2nd c.d. coming out real soon (prob this month or next month) So be sure ya'll check it out. I promis ya'll its off the chain. Peace
4,for jeff beck fans,"Not only a very good music performance, but a wonderful show to see the group interact with each other. Jeff, especially, is quite proud of his young bass player. You get the feeling its almost like a father / daughter relationship"
5,2 ITEMS,"I played the sample tracks-really liked it!when i can afford it,i may purchase it.Regarding the SanDisk Clip+...it was defective.However, y'all are replacing it-overnight!!!!- which is incredible.Another reason i'll continue to buy from your AWESOME company!"
2,Not worth it,Do not waste your money on this. The blu ray is quite boring and not worth the $30 bucks or so.
3,Help,"Hippies in the audience! Heads nodding meaningfully to jazz licks! 70' s type jazz rock! Eric Clapton! This should be enough as a warning. I mean I love Jeff Beck. He has done some really wonderful solo records over the decades and his time with the Yardbirds has established his status as a legend. But this clearly is very self-indulgent jazz-noodling guitar playing, the very reason why punk rock came along. I am shocked that it has gotten such amazing reviews, Also the young female bassist swaying to the reaggae basslines makes one cringe. I mean...what do they think? The bonus interview with Jeff Beck is great and is the reason why it does not get 0 points from me. I was expecting to love this DVD."
1,Excusive to Blu Ray only!,"As an exclusive to the Blu-ray release, Eagle include a seven track rockabilly set with the Big Town Playboys:01) Race With The Devil02) Crazy Legs03) Train Kept A Rollin'04) My Baby Left Me05) Matchbox06) Baby Blue07) Honky Tonk.For excluding these tracks on the SD, I rate this one flaming chili pepper. This is a crappy deal, as what Walmart did with Nickelback - Live at Sturgis."
5,Beck Live Finally,"Great product,bad service.Bought three copies of this vid.Charged $2.98 each for shipping a total of $8.94.According to the chart from the post office I could have shipped 18 lbs at that price.Repeated requests for help brought no results from Amazon and its vendor."
5,#1Guitarist for 40 years,Beck shows that he is still one of the top guitar player's in the Worldtoday!On this dvd he is joined by Eric Clapton on 2 classic blues number's.A must have for any guitar enthusiast!!!
1,BAD Shipping and customer support,"Had to wait 2 weeks to find out my order was out of stock. E-mailed and got no response, called and was told of the outage and asked if I would like to substitute for something else. POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES!!!"
3,Keep track of the visions in my eyes,"VISIONS is perhaps my 2nd favorite M:TG expansion of all time. That is why I'm sadden to only give this book 3 stars. The author showed no imagination in how various cards could work. He offers no real analysis of the cards that could not be gleemed from older articles about M:TG on the net. If you can get this book cheap, then go ahead. But don't pay full price for it, as Visions has long ago left the TYPE-II environment."
5,Five stars is not high enough for this book!!!,"I have been doing direct sales for almost ten years and have yet to come across a book as fabulous as this one!!! I came away with so many ideas from this book. Christie not only hits the mark with her TWIST on SOUR SITUATIONS but she gives the reader wonderful ideas on how to make your presentations/demos more fun & productive.Her ideas are all focused on how to make your business more customer oriented to increase not only your sales, but your datings. This book is a MUST for anyone doing direct sales. I cannot say enough great things about this book.Being only around 100 pages, it is an easy, quick read. But believe me, it is packed with great ideas!!!"
5,Fabulous resource!!,"Of all the books I've read on running a direct sales business, this is by far THE best. Written with a sprinkling of humor and just plain good common sense, there are TONS of ideas that are useable, not just theoretic! Her principles apply to any company that uses a home demonstration to promote sales/bookings."
1,Awful,"I am halfway through the book, and I really don't think I can finish it. It is very poorly written. I love a good Indian romance, but this book does not develop any of the characters, or show any true feelings, or even keep your attention. I don't think I can bear to finish reading it, I am bored to tears."
5,Nell Hill's Decorating Secrets,We are enthusiastic fans of anything from Nell Hill's and that includes the books. I have several and have given several away as gifts. Happy to know this is a source. Thank you for the quick delivery in time for a birthday.
5,Expat in Italy,"I received ""Simply Armenian"" last year as a gift and it is now one of my favorite cookbooks. Everything I've made from this cookbook has been delicious, healthful, and I feel a bit adventurous preparing these recipes. My husband loves the Nivik Salad and the Chicken and Spinach Borek stuffed pastry is the perfect meal in my mind. I also enjoy reading the accompanying family stories as I prepare each dish. ""Simply Armenian"" motivates me to step outside my comfortable routine of American and German cooking and try something different, more ethnic than usual. I'm happy to recommend ""Simply Armenian""."
4,Fast delivery,"Rack wouldn't revolve when I first opened the box, but my husband took it apart and oiled the little bearings and now it works fine. Very speedy delivery, thanks for the great service."
3,Good for the money,This was a good product for the price. It revolves with ease and is sturdy enough to not topple over.
4,revolving card holder,"This item is satifactory and does what I needed it to do. the transaction was accomplished quickly and received promptly, and in excellent condition."
4,Great addition,"The 6 deck revolving card holder has been a great addition to our Friday night card playing. We have enjoyed it so much, we bought one for the people who taught us to play ""Hand and Foot"". Wish we had taken it on our cruise."
4,perfect card holder for playing Hand and Foot!,"This is a very ""handy"" and neat card holder. Just slide the whole contraption up and down the table for the next person to reach!"
3,Card Shuffler,The card shuffler would be fantastic if the battery compartment was made better...the batteries in most things are next to each other which actuallyholds them in place...this compartment they are spread apart so far with anempty space in between and also it is a spring that one end of the batteryconnects to which bends all over the place and makes it very hard to make aconnection to it...We ended up squashing the spring and also packing tinfoilin the open space in between the batteries...what they should have is a battery holder that you snap the batteries into that would then set into thebattery compartment.....Very poor set up
5,The purrfect introduction to Albert King,"There are so many great r&b, jump blues oriented blues singers/guitarists, taht sometimes one disc has to cover a good overview, and this disc does the job. It has plaenty of jump blues stompers, as well as draggers and boppers. There is a little r'n'r but mostly shuffle blues rhythms, great for lindy hopping, jitterbug, jiving, or cruising or working on your 50's hotrod or custom. Awesome rockin' cd, essential! Also if you like Albert King, then Johnny Guitar Watson is a must(get ""Hot Just Like TNT""). Buy this now!!!"
3,Good,"This movie got awful ratings by critics and the audience but I liked it. I don't look at it like a blockbuster movie, I look at it like a DTV(Direct To Video) movie. I bought this for a total of $2.99 and was worth and also has tons of special features. This is not one of the worst movies ever."
3,Look! Up in the sky!,"This is the second volume of science fiction music rerecorded by Neil Norman, with help from the late great Les Baxter. This time around, the arrangements are closer to the original soundtrack versions, although some of the music still has a bit of a ""synth pop"" feel to it. The ""Star Wars/Empire Strikes Back"" medley in particular sounds rather ""discofied"". I should also mention that there are three songs here that are not from science fiction movies or TV shows at all. ""Daughter of the Lesser Moon"", ""Vampire Planet"" and ""March of the Lizard-Men"" are all original tunes written by Les Baxter or Neil Norman especially for this album. ""Vampire Planet"" is boring, but the other two are pretty good. Overall, this is a pretty entertaining album if you are a science fiction fan."
