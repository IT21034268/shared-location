5,bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew. However, I have seen the movie before, and I like it."
2,"I wanted it to be good. Dear God, I wanted it to be good...","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...The STAR WARS phenomena took off in 1977. At that time, STAR TREK: PHASE II was in early design for the television return of the Starship Enterprise. Welp, STAR WARS was the biggest movie of all time at that time, and the powers at Paramount Pictures decided that STAR TREK would be a movie.What no one remembered was what WAS STAR TREK? In the 1960s, STAR TREK was the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. It was the expanding of the human knowledge and wisdom, and it was a mirror on our society. STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is none of this.We're treated to so many beauty shots of the newly re-fitted Enterprise, that there are actually whole passages where you can go buy popcorn and not miss anything. STAR TREK in the 60s was also action-adventure. This movie is sssssslllllllloooooowwwwwwww, about 45 minutes too long. Luckily, there are more STAR TREK incarnations to watch that are much better."
3,"Good Science Fiction but Tame ""Star Trek""","""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" is a visual feast. The film is filled with stunning space imagery and futuristic settings, but it is not ""Star Trek"". This first ""Star Trek"" film suffers from lack of character. The story is good but it lacks the sense of danger and humor that the series excelled at. It's still a worthy Trek entry it just feels a little flat. The film series gets better from here."
4,Great updated effects.,"I noticed just a few little scenes that were not part of the original. But what I liked the most was seeing the Veger ship complete without the the energy cloud around it. Glad I seen this version. If you like the original, you should check this out."
2,"Must have for Trek colletors, otherwise...","Not much to be said about this film, use it for a sleep aid replacement. This or 2001:A Space Oddesy.The film is made longer, but not much so, (Even more BORING!)The Special Features are excellent, and much more exciting than the movie"
1,Self-indulgent effects show with minimal plot and acting.,"This is BY FAR the worst thing to come out under the Star Trek name - and I'm counting the cheesy original show! This movie went far too long with far too little reason to. The effects may have been cool in the 70's, but they aren't now. Even that would be fine if there was some interesting plot to back it up, but there isn't. With maybe one funny part in the whole movie (which is bad for a usually pretty funny series), this needs to be put on display in a museum, not rented out for home use. You have far better things to do with your time. If you want some good Star Trek, check out 'Wrath of Khan', 'Voyage Home', ""Undiscovered Country', or 'Genesis'. The new ones are good too - especially 'Insurrection'."
3,definitely not the worst trek film,"Okay, I admit that I love this movie because it was the first. The director's edtion is definitely an improvement. It is still long and slow, but now it is a little tighter. Not as tedious. This is a good cerebral story. Unlike Final Frontier, Generations, and Insurrection. It really explores ideas that are out there. That said, it would still have made a better t.v. episode than a movie, but at the time there was not series. As I understand it, it was to be the pilot of a new series. This is demonstrated by the t.v. type story. It is still better that Trek V or any of the TNG movies. If you haven't seen the director's cut you are missing out. If you never liked the movie give this version a try. If you just thought it meandered too much, give this version a try. I think you will enjoy it."
5,A Must Have but Not Must See,"I like this movie much more than the movie I saw in the theater in 1979.It makes more sense. It looks better.It is still not very good Star Trek.And so I am giving it a 5 Star rating only because it fills in a part of the archaeological record of Star Trek, not because it is an inherently good film.Call me low brow, but Robert Wise erred when he decreed that Star Trek, The Motion Picture was a ""MOOVIE"" and not a television episode.I wanted the old music. I wanted the old sets. I wanted the old action. I wanted excitement.STTMP was a boring movie, ponderous in its irrelevancy.But without this, there would be nothing else."
2,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"This movie is the second worst in all the other Star Trek films. There was absolutely no character development throughout the entire movie. Also, there was way to many dead air scences. For example Kirk is comunicating with Star Fleet and Kirk asks Star Fleet a question. Then there's a few seconds of silence and then Kirk answers back without the audience ever hearing anything Star Fleet said. That's just an example of poor edidting folks. I'm glad this is the only true terrible movie(besides Star Trek V) in the francise. Still, this movie did not have any major efffect in changing my love of Star Trek. I will always be a big fan. And as always... Live long and prosper."
3,More beats added to a good movie,"The director's edition is tweaked up effects wise but what is most striking are the added beats to scenes that didn't make it to the theatrical version. Uhura's vouching for Kirk's experience to the Ensign who point's out the Admiral's unfamiliarity with the re-fitted Enterprise, Spock's uncharacteristic display of emotion toward the alien entity. Little moments that add just a little flavor to this austere epic. But what truly moved me was the new overture. Running at three minutes it set the move perfectly and perhaps was my favorite addition of the Director's Edition."
3,On the fence...,"I thought the DVD release was good for what it is... i was pleased with the improved visual effects and scenes but was not happy with the fact that we don't have the option of viewing the extended VHS version with the original audio and visual effects. pleased with the finished products all in all... especially the Starfleet Headquarters shots, the Wormhole sequence and the Enterprise's first encounter with V'ger. as i said i would hope that Paramount releases the original extended cut on DVD for all the star trek purists."
2,It was downright BAD!!! I am sorry to say :(,"I am a huge Star Trek Fan 100%...but i am very sad to say that this film was disappointing. It was just downright BAD. Okay..maybe you might have a different opinion on the video, but i just fall asleep about 10 minutes after i put it on. The only part i like is when Spock makes a dramatic enterance onto the bridge. After i see that part, i just turn the movie off because i have more important things to do than waste my time watching a movie that is so boring, i fall asleep through the middle of it. Well, anyway...if i were you, i wouldn't waste my money on this video. No matter how big of a Star Trek Fan you can be..Believe me,you don't want it."
5,The best VI reference I've ever used!,The only problem with this book is learning vi and remembering all the commands you can do with vi! VI is the BEST editor there is! *PERIOD* YEah that's right!...
1,Piece of crap,THE SCALE MAKES A VERY LOUD RINGING SOUND WHEN ITS ON..IT IS NOT AMERICAN WEIGH..THE THING IS GARBAGE AND I WOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN..PROBABLY NEVER FROM AMAZON AGAIN EITHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST I EVER DEALT WITH.........
3,good product (recently) poor value,until very recently this was $7.07 for a 3-pack. then it went out of stock. now its &7.07 for a single. you can practically get a whole trap for that - bait included.
1,"You get one, not three refills","Rescue's product works very well. Its only drawback is that as others have noted, the product stinks (that's why it works so well). Probably for that reason, they changed to a foil packaging and in doing so, switched from three per package to one per package. While they changed their pricing, some distributors, like Ace Hardware are behind in changing their pricing. I ordered a season's supply of this three-pack, but they replaced it with the one refill per package. The effect was that they charged me over $5 each. I could have gone to Lowe's and bought a Rescue disposable fly trap with the attractant for $5. Don't order this until they show that they are only shipping the foil pack of one each and change their pricing. Otherwise, you too will fall prey to their bait and switch."
4,Stories your parents could have told you.,"I liked this book because it is written as if you are asking a relative what they did during the war. No one's story is too long, unlike my relatives who go on and one. (That's the author's trimmimg.) Yet I was fastinated. There are lots of big piture histories and if you know that history, fitting in the scene from a person on the ground is really very interesting. It's the why we fought, not for your country, but rather once on the line, not to let your buddies down. The feeling of regret when you finally meet the enemy and he looks just like you.Anyway I'd read ""Working"" by S.Turkel and liked it. This books is written in the same style."
5,Surreal...,"The third story in this books is rare genius.It is a surreal/absurd tale of a construction worker's odyssey to expose a corporate plot to build a shoddy bridge. As Erde tries to do this, he descends from a manhole into a bizarre surreal world.The story is entirely readable, not some pretentious, un-readable, ""pseudo-literary"" nonsense.. like Italo Calvino or something. It reminds me of the writing of Danhil Kharms, Witold Gombrowitz, or Virgillio Pinera. This kind of surrealism is rare in English. I wish there was more of this-- ReYoung, write another novel!The other two stories are good also-- just not as unusual as the third."
2,It's a Badly Produced Documentary,The information contained in the dvd provided individuals who have varying opitions (good) and who seemed to have conducted extensive research (good).What I didn't like was the quality of the production. I did not realize it was a documentary which looks to have been taken from a show that airs in England somewhere. I could have YouTubed the information for free.
2,Didn't Meet Expectations,"After reading the other reviews, my spouse and I were very excited about buying this book and teaching our daughter to sign. However, we were disappointed with the limited content of the book, and feel that a simple ASL dictionary or a class in ASL would be more helpful. I have found it difficult to implement ASL into my daily life w/my daughter as my hands are often full, both literally and figuratively. In addition, we are blessed to have a daughter who is very expressive and responsive and have found it fairly easy to communicate w/her and to anticipate her needs. Watching her efforts to communicate in her own ididsyncratic ways has been more enjoyable than trying to incorporate the sign language into our daily lives. Perhaps we will give it another try when she is a toddler."
4,great go-to book to get started,"More words then I'd like but a great source book to get you started on baby signs and additional information if you do want to teach your child the words dog or cat, and so on... I started w/ 'hi' and then the word 'more' when feeding her in the high chair. It gives you tips and reminds you that your child may sign out of the blue and can comprehend learning a few signs at once. I am using this plus DVD's on netflix and the infant potty training book. Infant communication does work!"
1,The worst!,This mop just spreads the water around and doesn't pick up anything...Takes forever for the floor to dry... I am sooooo sorry I purchased this mop and would not recommend it to anyone...It's the worst!
5,Stunningly good,"Cherish the Aloha and savor these fine 1920's selections that time has not forgotten. Celebrate Rose's sweet falsetto, Tau, Lani and Dorian's great playing and harmonies, and Bob Brozman's gentle musical ""laying of hands"" on this project. Standing-OH! Bravo, Bob, and thanks!"
2,you will like it if you are a baby.....,"I ordered it over the internet, hence had no chance of trying it first. It reminded me of a smell that I am familiar with-after too much ponderning it came to me! it really smells like baby Johnson's splash- on baby fragrance!!! .And honestly the baby fragrance is better thasn this one."
2,Little new content,"I recommend another book. There is little here that is not available through documentation, online tutorials or examples that come with swing itself."
5,How To Listen To God,I would highly recommend this book. He uses God's word to validate what we as Christians should be doing in our daily walk. As well he shows the love God has for all mankind.
2,Adequate but not much more,"I am going to Bhutan and was anxious to see a map to really see where I was going. It was just adequate. I think a map for such a mountainousregion should be more topographical with elevations shown. It would be better with valleys and mountains more clearly delineated. I guess there is not much out there for maps of Bhutan, but it could be some much better. The back of the map is absolutely blank and could be filled with either information or photos of the highlights of the country with map coordinates so you would know where to find them."
4,Included in hCG Diet iPhone app,"If you are planning to do this diet, you can buy the hCG Diet iPhone app and you get both the book content and a link to an audio podcast of the book. You can also just download this podcast from iTunes without getting the app.The app is pricey at $9.99, but then again, you get both the book (which you can only read within the app, not another ebook reader) and you get the app to help you track and manage your diet while doing the program.Links:- HCG Diet iPhone App in iTunes:[...]- Pounds and Inches book podcast in iTunes: [...]"
2,not what i expected....,only purchase this book if you want to know when where and why this diet was created.... this book isn't what i was looking for but i have done online searches on how to do the diet and do and don'ts....ended up with a lot more information that way. i am not saying this is a bad book it's just not for someone who is ready to start the diet and need the beginning and how to info.
5,Great Book,Great book. I've heard a lot about this diet and once I read the book it made much more sense. Much better then the downloads you can on internet that don't always include all the text.
1,Rescue Yellowjacket Trap,This trap has been in my backyard for three weeks without catching a single wasp. I followed instructions provided with the trap and the wasps don't even fly near it. Don't waste your money.
2,Only caught so many wasp!,"I agree with Working Mom mom, this trap only caught so many wasp! Now they're completely ignoring it! Meanwhile,they're worse than ever! I had to buy a couple of flying insect strips which seems to be working better! I don'tthink I will be ordering this item again!"
2,I kill more with......,"a flyswatter and bug spray! I also purchased and correctly applied the ""attractant"" as well as adding a small ammount of raw beef, replacing it every 2 weeks. As of today, I only caught 2 last year and none this year. They seem to just fly around it and then fly away."
1,Did not work on my Eastern Yellowjackets,It's clear to me after reading these reviews that the pheromone must be very selective for certain breeds of yellowjackets. It would be very useful if the reviewers would put the general location where they used the trap - so others would know if it worked on the yellowjackets prevalent in that area.I did not have any success with this trap in northern Maryland. Literally zero yellowjackets caught in 2 weeks.
5,Effective as Advertised!,"I live in rural North Idaho on a newly developed property and apparently the Yellow Jackets are well established in this area. We first used these traps while living in WA, near the manufacturer. All I can say is that if people are not catching any Yellow Jackets, they either don't have Yellow Jackets, or they are not using the product properly. They do not trap Wasps, Hornets, Bee's (Honey or Bumble) or any other stinging insect that I know of.They do, however, work like a Champ when it comes to Yellow Jackets. We have 6 of these traps set up near our home and I have had to empty them several times in the last few days. Next year we will definitely put them out earlier to catch the queens. This is a great product and I will likely add 2 more for next season.Wish the attractant was a bit less expensive though!"
4,Keeps on working...just don't expect miracles.,"I've had this for three weeks and it's trapped about 40 yellowjackets and continues to attract more. It doesn't perform miracles, but for my 25'x20' deck/porch area...I have noticed a drop in the overall yellowjacket population. The other thing I like - it doesn't trap the bees that I want around my garden (not a single bee has been trapped). I don't know how well the wasp-hornet-yellowjacket (W-H-Y) version of this trap works (this one is just for yellowjackets)...but I'm going to give that one a try too. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that Amazon offers the W-H-Y trap for about a dollar more. It seems it would be well worth the extra dollar to get the W-H-Y trap instead (as long as it works as well as this one does)."
2,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,This product did not work for me. I put it out there for 3 weeks and only caught a couple of flies. Pretty much a waste of money.
3,works as expected,Good product but the life of the scent to draw the wasps to the trap does not last as long as advertised. I would recommend using a piece of cooked meat and inserting into the trap. That is more effective if you use their scent.
3,Well Written,"Certainly, this movie is not up with Rocky and other great boxing movies, but if you look deep into this movie as you're watching it; it takes on more meaning. The characters in this movie were decent but nto great. This movie reminded me of Rocky V, but don't get me wrong; it's nothing liek it. This movie had drama, action, and some world issues in it. To make a long story short I think this movie is worth renting so check it out."
2,Cheap Trick's classic Surrender on Soundtrack and likable...,"though somewhat average HavanaGooding, Jr. Film. At least it'snot 'Snowdogs'. When I was at the'02 NHL Allstar game @ the homeof the best Pro basketball teamin L.A., the Clippers, somebodyyelled @ Gooding, ""Hey Havana,Snow Dogs sucked!"" Even Jewel,who was there singing the NationalAnthem and songs between periodslaughed!"
3,Resentful of the Amazon review,"I don't feel that the RH Factor's first album ""didn't keep its momentum all the way through."" That is one of the best albums in history. The music has such a positive message and is so uplifting. Strength, on the other hand, is much less focused. The approach is more of a jam session, whereas on Hard Groove the whole record is about the songs and the arrangements. One track on Strength, ""For Fun,"" is simply ""Common Free Style,"" with a displaced melody and without the free style. I would have expected more great collaborations with people like D'Angelo and Erykah for the RH Factor's second record. Strength is cool and has the same energy that the funk tunes on RH Factor do, but it is the combination of the funk, beautiful songs, and amazing vocalists and instrumentalists that made RH Factor unique, and one of my favorite albums ever."
2,Great movie; horrible DVD,"The movie is great but if you're buying it to own a high-quality, pristine copy to watch over and over again, you'll be disappointed.The DVD image is covered with white specks, dust, and long hairs. They appear every second or two and are very noticeable even at full-speed. I would expect a VHS tape to have better image quality than this.In addition, I couldn't get the ""special features"" menu to work on two of my DVD players (although one of my friends has no problem). This continued even after I exchanged the disc for a new one.If you absolutely must own this movie on DVD, then you have no other choice. But for the others, I would warn that this disc does not nearly match the quality of the other 95% of...discs available."
4,Wings of the Dove,"It was enticing with moments of sheer delight. There is great compassion between two lovers but little money. Then the idea of how to get money, but leave each other for the pursuit of money. What happens end the end must not be reveiled now."
3,Great For A+ Core---Terrible For DOS/WINDOWS,"I strongly suggest using another study guide if you ecpect to take the A+ DOS/WINDOWS and PASS. While this book is great for the CORE part of the exam, it is worse than TERRIBLE for trying to pass the DOS/WINDOWS section. I took the CORE exam using this book two months ago, and passed with flying colors. As a matter of fact I think I only missed one CORE question. However, after intense study for the DOS/WINDOWS section using this same study guide, I found not a single question on the now ADAPTIVE test to have anything to do with info covered in this study guide. I FAILED with a 408, needing at least a 468 to pass. Now I have to go out and search for a new study guide and take the DOS/WINDOWS all over again. I am NOT a happy camper!"
2,confusing,This book is extremely confusing. She throws out so many names and religions in such a short frame that it's impossible to follow along. You basically have to already have a good knowledge of all the religions she is talking about to understand what is going on. I had no knowledge of any religions prior to reading this book and it left me very confused.I only managed to read about 60 pages before I had to completely stop. I cannot believe how many positive reviews this book has.
5,Legend's return,"I remember watch it on TV when I was just a little boy, but what really amaze me then and now is how a TV show influenced by the Star Wars Phenomenon, could became a great epic and tragic saga far more realistic and deep than the George Lucas work.This is not one war's tale with happy ending and powerfull heroes is a travel towards the soul of a group of people fighting their last stand to save their lives.Glen Larson, Richard Hatch, Lorne Green and Dirk Benedick make history in the universe of science fiction with less resources and time than many great movies and TV Shows"
3,disappointing,"I seem to remember when I was growing up a later series of battlestar galactica on TV with a totally new cast except for Lorne Greene, in it they finally reach earth...where is it?!?!and therefore I find this set very disappointing."
4,"Great DVD set, but not complete","This set is not complete since Season 2 is not included. Yes, there is a season 2. The series was not cancelled before season 2 started, but during season 2. Therefore, this is not the ""Complete"" set. One can hope they come out with a Season 2 boxed set."
5,DVD collection,Great collection of Battlestar Galatica. All the discs play great and good quality.Long time since I have seen the series and am enjoying viewing them again. Its packaged well and a good keepsake. Recommend for anyone who loves sci-fi and PG entertainment.
1,"$65.00, FOR THIS?!","Absolutely incredible, this set goes for $65.00 dollars, and the picture quality SUCKS!, there's many tears, dirt, and other stuff appearing on the picture, it says the picture has been remastered...yeah right, I don't believe it, it couldn't have been, it looks that bad, really remaster this, and I'll consider buying it, shame on you Universal!"
3,OK... I'm Confused,"Did I miss something? Isn't this already released? I mean, I've owned it for months, so... what's going on?Oh, and yeah, I like it a lot. The 3 star rating I gave it factors in my distaste for the double-sided disc format of the set. The show is great fun and has a few really outstanding episodes, particularly the story arc of the last few."
3,For hardcore fans only,"First of all I feel the price of this set is ridiculous. Even with the special box, this series is just not worth it. It was a decent enough show for the 70's, but thirty years later it may not hold the appeal it did when we were kids. I might consider buying this after the price has fallen a bit."
4,Deleted Pilot Feature Film (1978 Widescreen Edition),"The pilot feature film was decent quality but, Edward James Olmos, the star of the later, newer version Battlestar Gallactica Series thought the casino/bar scene with the 3 faced women/monster was really cheesy! As the Review Title indicated the pilot feature film isn't included!"
4,Give Battlestar Galactica a chance.,"Yes there were good episodes and some bad ones.But what hurt the show was it's budget and it should had been a mini-series and not a regular TV show.But hats off to the fans including myself who never gave up on the show.I've also heard there are a number of episodes that were never seen by the fans which haven't been released and they are better than what aired on ABC-TV.If Battlestar Galactica makes a successful comback and it does even better than it did the first time around,then George Lucas should ask himself where did he went wrong with The Phantom Menance and Attack of the Clones."
1,Nada,"I ordered an item from this seller. 3 days after last supposed day for item to be shipped I contacted the seller. I go no return message or explanation. Therefore had to file a claim. No excuse for someone who ,on their own, decided to be a seller and to treat people like this is without excuse. Why people are so much more rude these days is beyond me."
1,What a disappointment!,"There is NO DISK #1 in the box, instead there is a second DISK #3 in it's place and Barnes & Noble won't replace it because it is over 14 days since I bought it! What ever happened to customer service?!?!"
4,Battlestar Gallactica........not quite the way that I remember it.,"I fully enjoyed the first that I watch, (front and back) and had noticed some continuity issues. But it seems somewhat to be an attempt of what we would call today ""forming alliances"" on a reality TV show. I hope that the rest are a little better to follow that the first 3 movies (shows)But I'm still in love with the cylon head with the visor that floats back and forth. I've got to get me one of them! LOLAs for the packaging, I'm glad that I got the cylon head one and will enjoy the whole series for many years to come!"
5,Third Time Excellent...,"I've liked Electric Six since I saw their Danger! High Voltage video on TV. I love both Fire and Senor Smoke, although I think Fire is the better of the two -- S.S. is more varied, and has some fantastic songs (Bite Me, Jimmy Carter, Be My Dark Angel and Vibrator) but has some duff tracks, like the redundant and unwelcome cover of Radio Ga Ga. Fire is more one note, but there isn't a naff number on the album.Switzerland has both Fire's high energy and Senor Smoke's range of styles and all the songs are great. They're accessible and catchy from the first hearing. They have Valentine's eccentric lyrics -- sometimes subversive, sometimes bizarre, often amusingly puerile -- and the musicianship and instrumentation are never less than solid and occasionally rise to brilliance. So far, my favourite track is I Buy the Drugs (nice, dirty baseline, rousing hooks and thoughtful instructions), but the others aren't far behind.It's too bad that five stars are all there are..."
5,Your collection of CDs should include this,"This CDs is one of the most important albums of Carlos Jobim, no wonder it is published in several versions (limited, luxury, gold and who knows what else...). It is also a milestone in the history of Bossa Nova, this album had a tremendous success in the US and launched the bossa nova craze. Responsible for the orchestration was Claus Ogerman (one of his recent deeds is the album Look of love of Diana Krall). This music is joyous and melancholic at the same time, it is impossible to get bored when listening to it, not even if you do so for the 100th time. The sound quality and the package is also fantastic."
5,"""Flashbeagle"" is a true classic!!","You've GOT to own this video, just to have the ""Flashbeagle"" episode, if nothing else. ""He's your Dog..."" is a good flick, but without a doubt, ""Flashbeagle"" will make you forget about it, because it ROCKS---literally! All the song's from ""Pepperment Patty's PE Program"" to ""Lucy Says"" and of course the title song give this Peanuts episode all the makings of the 80's MTV/music video craze (which was the big thing when this episode first aired). I'm 26 now, and I remember it when it was first out--and when I see it, it just takes me back--it's awesome! It's a delight for all ages! I highly recommend it."
3,It was ok,"I had a hard time reading this book and I'm not sure if it was because I had to read it in pieces, but I just didn't connect with the characters. I had a hard time relating to the narrator and to the main character of the book, though the book is wonderfully written and I often found myself thinking that the author had a fantastic way of painting a picture with his words, but the plot just wasn't for me. Would recommend it for those that like drama stories with minimal action."
5,Classic,"Extraordinary. Put your thinking cap on because James Herriott weaves words in such a way that most modern writers cannot do today. And that's okay. Makes me feel less like a dummy and more like the intelligent student I was before I dummied myself down. In the book I kept feeling sorry for the poor wife back home, but it all resolved itself in the end. I will read it again.Can't tell you enough how much I adore my kindles!"
3,"style is a little dated, but very interesting and readable",I enjoyed this book about post WWI/pre WWII England and the aftermath of the 1st of these wars. The tale of the amnesiac veteran who came home to take over the family business when he would rather have been a scholar was believable. I found the ending a little unbelievable and very romaticized; but the writing is solid and I think this novel stands the test of time. I'd give it 3 and 1/2 stars if there were a way to indicate half a star in Amazon's system.
4,For fans of Downton Abbey,"""Random Harvest"" is a wonderful read and reminds us of all the British writers who were so good at telling a compelling story. There are many echoes of ""Downton Abbey"" with its stately estates and World War One scenes but Hilton's is a far more complex story with stronger emotional undertones.I must extend kudos to Amazon for making ""Random Harvest"" a 'daily deal'. I bought it for $1.99 because of the price, no other reason. It would be great if Amazon could make more books by Hilton, A.J. Cronin, and Nevil Shute available at a bargain price."
2,Didn't Finish Reading Despite Good Reviews,"I've gone back to this book a number of times but just haven't been able to get into it. By the time I read halfway through, I gave up. After reading most of the other reviews, maybe I'll watch the movie instead."
3,Interesting bit of pop culture,"I enjoyed the book. I doubt people who don't like the Beatles (horrors!) or who don't care about weird episodes in American pop culture will be interested. The narritive style may be a little too novelized to swallow but it is presented in an entertaining fashion. When does the movie come out?By the way, I know of one clue not mentioned. On the cover of the U.S. album _Yesterday and Today_, the Beatles are posing around a steamer trunk with Paul sitting inside. Looking at this cover from the right angle makes it look like he is in a coffin.This, of course, is in the eye of the beholder."
3,Thin and Incomplete,"Good as far as it goes, but has some editing errors involving photos and subject matter that weaken it terribly. There are better books on A+ including the Myers Exam Guide, A+ Adaptive Exams, and the Schmidt Certification Self Study manual. If you have a large budget, this book has mostly worth while information."
5,Great For Beginners - But Not Solely For Beginners,"This book is so great - I bought this a long time ago, back when I was first learning HTML. I can't tell you what a great resource it was for me. I learned so much, so fast from this book. It really is a simple, straightforward guide to HTML and it actually teaches you a lot about what you are doing so that you can learn and apply these concepts to your own projects. It's a guide that beginners should definitely turn to, but is great for people who aren't just beginners as well because it has tons of cool stuff that you can learn even if you do know a bit about HTML. Plus it would be a great reference guide while building a website for yourself or for someone else. And another great highlight of this book is that its not skimpy or condescending like some of those 'for dummies' books."
4,A Progressive band of the 90's,"Animal Bag is an amazing band of many sorts. Their debut offers us a comprehensive glimpse at their creative genius. They were a band that stood solid upon Alternative and Psychedelic/Progressive rock, Folk, and even Tribal/World influences. Luke Edward's vocals and lyrics are incredible and always unique and the band mesmorizingly flowed between Alternative rock, to a psychedelic ballad, and on to an acoustic anthem with hand drums. There was never anything else like this band and they still lack the attention that they have always deserved. Rest in Peace Boo, and thank you for your great drumming with Animal Bag.Peace,Ben."
2,What a disappointment,"When I read the abstract for this book I thougth I would pick up some information or process description that would help pick out the most economical scheme to process a given feedstock. Instead what I got was mostly a rehash of what I can get from Hydrocarbon processing without any hard numbers or equations to use. The author spends most of the time describing databases of process inoformation he has collected and how he went about correlating the results, but without ever bothering to print the correlations that were developed. Instead you get tables comparing the authors correlations to other correlations which also are not published. This does nothing to help you know how to predict the performance of a unit."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house. I was hopeful this would be a great product, but unfortunately, it's not. The whole set isn't very good in quality and I figure they would probably break if you used them very heavily. I just threw the set in the garage in case every other socket I have disappears, I at least have this set as a backup."
3,"Hey, they're tools","I bought this kit not expecting but so much quality given the price. They're really not too bad, all things considered. The handle seems a bit 'iffy' sometimes, but they do the job. A bigger foam cushion would've been nice, as the sockets are all over when I open it. If you need rugged-reliability then go for the big name brands. If you need a cheap socket set that'll get you by, this is for you."
3,Great neck set,Thought this would be great for my son with his truck that he got in the summer. This was for Christams and he really liked it.
4,My husband likes it!,My husband seems to like it. It serves its purpose. It doesn't seem cheap. Nothing has broken or cracked on the set.
1,"not a good buy, at all, ever, not even if you're drunk","i have ,as many people do, a problem with shoddy workmanship and no attention to detail. when i got this i was unpleasantly surprised to notice that the seams from the molding of the ratchet were still there, the knurling on the handle didnt cover the whole handle, and the actual ratcheting action was tough. i got a better ratchet set for literally a dollar at lowe's for an after christmas sale.... dont buy this product and stick with name brand tools, there's a reason they made it to be a name brand"
3,It was ok,the rachet slips from the first time I use them. The packaging of them was really bad. I will have to get another set.
3,Got the job done; good for the price...,"To make a long story short, I basically needed a socket set to install a replacement mirror housing on to my car that had been knocked-off. Money was pretty tight at the time, and this was in the budget. Looking at the reviews, I really wasn't expecting much, but for less than $10, I'd say it's worth it. The ratchet feels a bit flimsy, but it got the job done. Even if it doesn't last that long, the included sockets make the set worth the asking price."
1,Cheapest build quality I have ever seen in my life,"I know this is only 10 bucks and I was certainly expecting cheap and cheerful. But this beats all standards of a poorly made product. The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place. The ratchet is the cheapest I have ever seen and the sockets themselves are very poorly finished. Comes with duplicate sockets - one each for quarter inch and 3/8 inch I believe. A simple 3/8 to 1/4 adapter would have sufficed, but that's an entirely separate design issue. I would never buy this again, even for the low price."
5,A celebration of the endurance and spirit of a migrant woman,The Perfect Silence is a stark and honest tale of children loss and abuse and its aftermath. You are pulled in and held captive throughout this celebration of the endurance and spirit of a migrant woman. The prose is rich and poetic; each word or phrase has earned its place. A truly magnificent book.
5,Still watching after one year,I bought this video for my nephew on his 2nd birthday because he loves trucks. His 3rd birthday is approaching soon and I am told this video tape is still his favorite!
4,A Big Hit With My 3 Year Old,"My 3 year old is a big fan of fire trucks. He loves seeing them, going to the fire house and playing with toy fire trucks.He has also been a big fan of the video Road Construction. When heard about There Goes A Fire Truck I immediately bought it for him. AND HE LOVES IT! Wakes up in the morning asking for ""Fire Truck Video"".Turns out that my 6 year old daughter and 9 year old son also liked it. As an adult it was interesting for the first time or two.Now for the hard part which is a video that a 3 year old wants to see again and again."
1,NAS?,"what the hell does your statement have to do with a review for headphones, and Im guessing you ment rapper not raper, although i wouldnt be suprised."
1,My Parents Made Me Watch This and then Apologised!,"This movie was awful, my parents made me watch it with them for family bonding time and when the awful movie was over they admitted that they didn't like it either and actually apologized for making me watch it with them! I like Clint Eastwood and Bernadette Peters and think they deserved a better movie that didn't waste their talent!"
5,"gritty, witty, and stylish crime drama","This movie has some rawness and grit, interesting story line, plot, and sub-plots, with Eastwood as a tough no-nonsense detective, Speer, and Reynolds as an ex-cop and Private Eye, Murphy, who butt heads with each other, in Prohibition-era 1933 (last year of Prohibition, in fact), but team up to investigate mob murder and corruption. It also has some funny lines and wittiness. And of course, Eastwood, with his intensity, as well as his piano playing, is in true form as usual. This movie has been under-rated by many, and appreciated by few, but it's a true mid-1980's gem, with good music, drama, and sass."
2,A funny Eastwood in unfunny film,"Quite possibly the worst film Clint Eastwood has ever made (and I'm even counting ""Revenge of the Creature""), ""Pink Cadillac"" still has at least one thing to recommend it: the star himself. Eastwood is quite funny at times in this otherwise dumb comedy, and his performance represents a stretch from his usually laconic manner. Not a must see by any means, but worth a look for Eastwood fans with nothing much else to do."
4,city heat from amazon.com,"Entertaining as all get-out. Cinematic license in the fights and shoot-out scenes, of course, but still entertaining. Wisecracking was a plus.Kurt"
3,mostly black and white images,"Disappointed. Most of the art is not in color, just black and white images (and small, to boot!). My used copy smelled like an ash tray. Not happy. This book is merely useful as a catalog for this artist's works of Shakespeare-based art."
2,Disappointed child and mama!,"My 20-month old son loves Road Construction Ahead and many other videos that focus on earth-moving equipment and ""machines"", as he calls them. We purchased this video hoping to add a little variety to his collection but have been disappointed with it. For a young child, perhaps under 3, this video has far too much dialogue, not enough action, and loads of ridiculously unfunny jokes and slap-stick humor that little kids just don't get. My son likes looking at the video box but doesn't enjoy the video at all. Try Road Construction Ahead instead."
5,My 2 1/2 yr old LOVES this video,"First my son was a tractor fan since my dad is a farmer. But ever since my son saw a bulldozer and a loader doing construction work at our house, he's loved to watch any type of construction vehicles, too. He got this video for Christmas and we've watched it at least 3 times a day. I have to admit, Dave, the host, seems a little goofy acting, but my son sure doesn't notice it. We also bought ""There Goes a Fire Truck"" but he barely even watched it thru once. My mom also has the train one and she said her school kids weren't interested in it either. They seem to have too much information and not enough action. My son is begging for the tractor one next."
1,Worthless,"Maybe it was just my application. I had a pitted winshield. I tried this product and followed directions. Absolutely no results. I understand the concept, but the product must only work in very limited and specific ways."
4,"THE BEST SEQUEL , THE DVD FEATURES ZERO STARS","THIS SEQUEL TO THE FIRST BATMAN MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST. AGAIN MICHAEL KEATON RETURNS AS BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE HE AS ALWAYS DID A GOOD JOB AS THIS CHARACTER, THEN DANNY DeVITO DID A GOOD JOB AS THE PENGUIN/OSWALD COBBLEPOT AND LAST BUT LEAST MICHELLE PFEIFFER DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB AS CATWOMAN(SHE LOOKS SEXY IN THAT OUTFIT)BUT AGAIN AS THE SPECIAL FEATURES ZERO STARS BECAUSE AS WITH THE FIRST ONE IT HAS NOTHING.BATMAN 5/5BATMAN RETURNS 5/5BATMAN FOREVER 2/5BATMAN AND ROBIN 1/5STICK WITH BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS."
4,More Burton Than Batman,"Director Tim Burton pursues his gothic vision and Michael Keaton returns to reprise his starring role as the caped crusader in the second installment of the Batman series titled, 'Batman Returns.'There are so many positives in this film and yet it still falls one star below the first Batman. The special effects are better, the bizzare, neo-goth costumes and surrounding landscape are higly evocative and utterly original and the cast is excellent, but something is missing. And what is that, it's Batman. There's more Burton than Batman in this film. Director Tim Burton was obviously more interested in expanding his creativity than he was in exploring the Batman mythos and it shows.Cast includes; Danny DeVito (the Penguin), Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Vincent Schiavelli, Paul Ruebens and Michael Gough as Alfred. Bottom line, there's too much Goth in Gotham City."
2,This was such a boring movie................................,I cannot believe how bad this movie was... I mean I liked the other Batman movies but this seems like such a bad movie. I cannot believe the stupid worthless scenes and the amount it frightened my child when we were watching it together.
4,Batman Returns review part 2 part 1 on Batman Returns 2 disc DVD 8/10,Continuing (I'am not making this up) Selina Kyle is brought back to life by Cats then she becomes Catwoman. The Penguin's gang places a bomb on the Batmobile Batman is then framed by Penguin for kidnapping & killing the Ice Princess Batman overcomes it like always & during this Penguin has control over the Batmobile Batman records what the Penguin says & later uses it to ruin his Mayoral bid. Penguin goes ahead with his plan all along to kill all 1st born sons of Gotham.Batman Returns is a good sequel it's enjoyable it's not as good as the 89 movie or The Dark Knight but a good sequel. Back in 92 there was some controversy about the dark tone to the movie thanks to soccer moms & I liked the tone to the movie. It was teens & adults that made up the audiences for the 89 movie & Batman Returns anyway. BTW do some d**n parenting soccer moms.
1,AWFUL,"This has to be the worst Batman movie ever made, if not the worst movie period. Clown gangsters, suicide penguin bombers, a giant rubber duck with tank wheels, how much worse can it get? Much, much worse. A terrible, almost nonexistent, storyline, bad special effects. I can't even begin to explain the downright stupidity of this movie. Do not waste your time or your money."
2,"Good movie, bad dvd",this is just a re-release of the original bare bones dvd. no bonus content at all.
2,IN ONE WORD BORING!!!,"I found BATMAN RETURNS to be a dull film even for the caped crusader I felt that MICHEAL KEATON looked and acted bored in this film. MICHELLE PHIEFFER I really could'nt stand either, the only person I liked was DANNY DEVITO as the PENQUIN as he stole the show like JACK NICKHOLSAN before him he's the only reason this film is'nt a total disaster. I'm not going to even metion CHRISTOPHER WALKEN'S character you'll see why when you watch this film. All in all this film is not as bad as BATMAN AND ROBIN but it's close. One final word TIM BURTON how could you?!!"
5,An Extraordinary Work of Art,"I love this movie. I feel that this movie was very under appreciated. The character performances were beautifully illustrated by the actors. It's as though they're real people. I loved the depth and complexity of the characters. I especially enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman. Catwoman was played with so much finesse. There were so many sides to this character and they were all played so wonderfully. The performances of Batman, Max Shreck, and the Penguin are also played with great strength. I also enjoyed the visuals and the score that the movie offered. Tim Burton is a brilliant and creative artist. I also loved the music. Danny Elfman is one of the most brilliant composers I've ever had the opportunity to listen to. This movie is so extraordinary. I commend everyone who put their time and effort into making this movie."
2,First unsatisfactory Oreilly book,"This book covers everything about the Java I/O library however the examples are so bad.... The author used a generic class for all the samples!! This is a good example of reusability however it doesn't help people who want to learn or copy those examples..... Frankly I don't recommend this book. If you're looking for good examples check out ""Java Examples in a Nutshell"" from the same editor...."
2,"Stiff, disjointed, and random","With altogether too brief funny moments to break it up, the overall feel of this movie was amaturish and wooden. Based on a hard to believe premise - would you, as an ex who was jilted 10 short months ago, agree to be the Maid of Honor for the lover who left you? - nope, me either. I kept feeling like I was watching a bad high school theater production - shot in the Winchester mystery house. Continuity issues, a weak and disjointed story line heavy on the stereotypes, and a badly stiched together plot drove this movie into the dirt for me.Watching paint dry would have been so much more entertaining.I want my 98 minutes back."
3,Its a fun B movie with too quick plot,"The movie's premise while cliche is a stable in LGBT cinema. It's a funny movie to watch and has some hilarious lines, unfourtunately the writer/producer/star/director Trish Doolan put too much into the movie. There are too many characters with their own side storylines that are resolved too quickly as well as the main plot being summed up in a matter of hours (tv time). The story is set during a bridal shower and after a bit of controversy everything gets wrapped in a neat little package. If the time span had been longer though this would have made for a much more plausible movie. But if you're not looking for plausibility or deep thinking than this movie is fun to enjoy and get a few good laughs."
4,"April's Shower is a Refreshing, Fresh Film","""April's Shower"" is a funny, moving, entirely believable film about the choice between what the heart desires and what society will accept. I would recommend this film highly to anyone with an open mind who likes good comedy (a rarity in Hollywood these days).Basic synopsis: Alex has been asked to be the maid of honour at her friend April's wedding, and is in the process of throwing April her wedding shower. There's just one complication: Alex and April used to be lovers, but April left because she was afraid of coming out dating another woman. When Alex let's their relationship slip during the shower (in front of April's controlling Mother) things get surreal.""April's Shower"" is filled with funny, lively characters. It benefits from a well-written script, a capable cast, and a breezy and engaging pace. The Heathen Hippy gives it four fresh bouquets."
1,April's wet blanket,"I appreciate the effort. I really do. Especially from a woman filmmaker on a tight budget. I applaud the movie for that reason only. 1 star for effort!But, honestly, aren't there any decent scripts and actors out there? Isn't there anyone willing to invest money in lesbian films? We are STARVED for anything half way decent, and will shell out some bucks on Amazon to get it. But I refuse to part with hard earned cash for something on par with the very bad ""Bar Girls,"" which describes this movie to a T.Unfortunately, this film gets one star from me because (a) it was completely unbelievable, (b) the pacing was terrible, (c) the acting was energetic, but not in the right places, and (d) I was bored.A MUCH better low budget/made by women film is ""Kissing Jessica Stein."" Even ""Go Fish"" gets points for style (and 2 stars from me, although it DID have worse acting). Back to the drawing board! And don't ask for my money until you have something at ""It's in the Water""-level or better."
4,if you like a challenge find this book,The Ultimate Maze Book is full of 39 diffrent maze. Each one as challenging as the next. Each maze has a story before it. It helps to place you in a mood for each maze. I like to time myself to see how fast I can do them. If you are lucky enough to find this book get some tracing paper because you won't want to ruin your book or photo copy the maze you want to do. Each maze is in beautiful color. Enjoy and have fun
1,DO NOT BUY - WILL NOT LAST,"I know from experience. I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. I think one company makes them all. They will NOT last. The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. For some reason, it only happens with the Palm-type cables. My iPod and USB retractable cables have lasted. Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.See my PALM page at [...]"
3,"not bad,considering","Let's face it,this is probably the best autobiography that Grace Slick was gonna come up with.The maxim,""If you remember the 60's,you weren't really there"" is probably truer for Grace Slick than anybody else.Frankly,I'm amazed that she can recall as much as she does!(Don't get me wrong,I love Grace.)I had this review printed earlier,but it was removed for some reason."
3,Starts out pretty good but......,"The first two thirds of the book are pretty good, although it's obvious that she keeps many secrets untold. Not as much detail about her early life as I would have liked. It's obvious that she has lead a very interesting life, but I got the impression that she's not ready to tell the whole story yet. The final third of the book can be skipped unless you want to hear about her political (extremely left) views, which more or less reads like any other left wing ranting."
3,Grace Slick Feeds Our Heads with a look at her life.,"Grace Slick, although long retired from the Rock and Roll scene has come up at age 59 with an interesting look at her life, loves, music, and being part of the dynamic Jefferson Airplane. After 1967 the Airplane emerged out the Haight-Ashbury as the leading edge of the San Francisco Sound that included the Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish, and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Grace was viewed as the Acid Queen by psychedelic revelers who would time their peaking to commence with the Airplane set at San Francisco's Fillmore or Avalon Ballroom's. The memoir will have some historical value as an example of life and activities in San Francisco during the 60's and 70's. Some of her memories definately will become Rock and Roll trivia items now that they are in print - some of them are x-rated for sure and not for the timid reader. I guess you will have to read the book to find out more about it."
4,worth getting,"I held off getting this CD for the longest time ... uh, 20 years or so! But I found it recently in the sale bin of a local shop and thought that I might as well take the plunge, having enjoyed TPOH debut album all those years ago. Well, this isn't as wonderful as that Rundgren-produced goodie, but there are still some very catchy songs on here. I'll agree with the reviewer that thought ""A Villa in Portugal"" should have been a single. Another addictive slice of pop pie!"
3,"Help me, Please","There was a very good video of this (much better than the book) shown on TV several years ago. I have searched in vain all over the internet trying to find a copy. If you can help me find one, please send me an e-mail: nicolette_f@usa.net"
2,too idealistic for me...,"This isn't the first Louisa May Alcott book that I've ever read, but it made me a little sick from sugar-shock. Everyone loves each other and money isn't very important to the characters with the exception of one person. I picked out this book because the title seemed quite interesting, but it was about Edith's absolutely pure heart for a good part of the story. Alcott did well for her first book, but not up to par. It reminds me of many other cute romances published today and I must say it isn't timeless. She wrote about English Lords and lived in New England! I've always heard that authors should write what they know, but Alcott didn't. Alcott, thankfully matured in writing over the years and I am grateful as a lover of American Literature."
4,"A Pretty Good Book, Could Have Been Better","A friend, who along with me is a great fan of romances, handed me this book during school, telling me it was a fablous book. She had seen the movie, and had gotten the book afterwards. As I read this, I found it intresting, but a little slow. It is a very predictible book, but what really got me is the character development. That was the best part of the whole book! This book is worthwhile, but I have read better."
3,Soft porn of rather fifties.,"Sometimes I feel watching a sort of humoristic mimicry on soft porno movie with some reference to Duma novel.Funny, some porno stars (Jeremy, for instance) involved non-sufficiently are.Provides not much info on a classic book but passing time in absence of something more hard-depicting."
3,very technical but usefull field guide for eastern US,"Beginners would probably find this book frustrating, as it has no pictures and relies on familiarity with botanical terms. However, If you are willing to learn the terms and parts of plant anatomy, this guide is fairly easy to use, particularly for genus level identification. The one frustrating part of this book is that the index only refers to scientific names. So going back and forth between scientific and common can be a bit of a hassle."
1,Did not like these.,"Not much to say... I love dates, but these bars were terrible. I ended up throwing most of them away."
4,this parfum is nice....,"Truth is a nice perfum, I'm using it during a day and I feel good and chic....."
4,"Slower pace, lower intensity of exercises is about right","My wife introduced me to this DVD courtesy of the local library as a way to help me get started with yoga and also alleviate some of the back pain that I have from time to time. As a neophyte to yoga, I found the slower pace and lower intensity of this series of exercises about right. Plus, I like the fact the yoga sequence is just a bit more than 20 minutes, making it possible to fit in a session later in the evening or whenever time is short but tension high.I can understand how more experienced yoga practitioners would find this DVD underwhelming, but I've found the exercises helpful at preventing back pain, strengthening muscles, and gradually increasing my flexibility.I've tried a few other yoga DVDs as well, and this one, like those, would benefit from including a printed guide covering some of the basic terminology, poses, and positions."
1,Disappointed,The video shows a handful of yoga poses that lasts about 5 minutes. The next 20+ minutes of the video is a loop of the first 5 minutes.
1,Poor recording,"I have had this yoga dvd before and it is a great one work out by. However the recording of this one was not done correctly and the introduction played fine, but the actual yoga routine would not play. Maybe it was a bootleg recording."
1,Don't waste your time.,"The author finished the book in early 2002, therefore many of the controversial decisions Mr. Rumsfeld made are not discussed. Mr. Krames is an avid fan of the previous Defense Secretary which blinds his objectivity. He never interviews the employees that worked for the secretary in the public or private sectors. All of his ancedotes are taken from an elite group. The reader will not learn anything new about Mr. Rumsfeld's decision making."
2,For those who have trouble falling asleep at night,"Now don't get me wrong,I love a good conspiracy book or one about some future domestic conflict as much as the next guy.With that being said, I found this book one of the most boring books I read in a very long time! I've had this book for about a year now, and I started it half a dozen times but I've never been able to get past the first 50 pages.While I give the author credit for his obvious exhaustive research, he desprately needs someone to show him how to write a book that is readable! This is not a novel as much as it is a referance book.If someone ever needed to look up facts and figures,this is the place to go.With a pie chart or bar graph on every third or fourth page it is more an encyclopedia than a novel.If you're looking for entertainment or even info-tainment, avoid this book!!!"
5,Thank you.,"Appreciate the fast service for this very useful item for cooking. I only found it in a store in Florida, and could not find it in New York."
4,Only one downfall.,"I loved these boots but there was one thing that disapointed me. there are no eyelets for the laces. I have had my boots for about 8 months and although i do still wear them, a few months ago the lace holes wore out and the leather came apart so now there are a few places where the lace has nowhere to go through. other than that I love the boots, they are light and comfortable."
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good for the money, but I don't use them any longer. Decided to go for a more unobtrusive look and switched to a Bose system with micro-speakers, which doesn't take over the room."
3,It's OK,Focused a little too much on being coupled and wanting to be in a relationship. Overall tone of the book was whiny.
2,disappointing,"I was expecting so much more after _Dawn and this book wasa disappointment. I know many people who never bothered toread the last book in the series because this one lefta bad taste in their mouths.The characters just didn't connect, no empathy with them."
3,As limited and simplistic as the Windows version,"I gave Brian another chance, hoping the Linux version of his book would be techier, somehow. But it's still the same simplistic (as opposed to simplified) approach.For example, I couldn't find anything on how to set up printing in the Linux/Solaris window. (Printing is fairly important to me.) This extremely complex window isn't covered anywhere; I had to blunder through on my own to figure out how to do duplex printing and to figure out all the printing options.""Linux"" isn't anywhere in the index, even.Yes, there are nice pictures everywhere, and what it covers it covers nicely. But as with the Windows book, this book mostly documents the things you could figure out on your own. It seems to have taken the approach of ""Leave out all the hard stuff."" Leaving the hard features out of the book doesn't mean you won't encounter them (late at night, before a deadline) in StarOffice."
3,Hunting for Collectors,"I'm lead to believe this was the first album and almost impossible to get for a long while, saying this, I have to say this is not KH's best effort. There are some great little tunes on it and a fab version of ""Blue Moon Of Kentucky"". It really is one for the collector as it glimpses at the greatness to come."
5,Best Foreclosure book EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best Pre-Foreclosure book ever written. But me being new to the whole real estate thing I had to buy a book on basic real estate, to catch up because this book is more for somebody who know a little bit about real estate. Very good read though."
1,Everything you ever wanted to know about foreclosures but was afraid to ask,I purchased this book some 6-8 months ago and I have used it and the resourses provided by Thomas on a daily basis. I am a nurse and I am looking to retire int he nxt couple of years. You cannot buy another book on the market that provide the informaiton and resources that this book provides. I give it a 5+rating.
2,It's OK,"The book is decent, but there are much better books on foreclosures out there.I wasn't very impressed with the amount of information that was given. I was able to find out more in some of the other books."
5,No Nonsense.,"No nonsense. Jammed with good information. Step-by-step, very do-able instructions for those interested in making money investing in pre-foreclosures. A very worthwhile read."
2,"Good chair, cheap bag","The chair is fine, but it comes with a VERY poorly made carrying back. The bottom started tearing out the very first day I had it."
4,the bag is BAD,The chair is good but like the other guy said the bag is BAD....mine all had rips in the bag right when I got it out of the Amazon box.
2,Light duty only!,"Fine for kids and small people on firm ground, but I had two ofthese things fail at the exact same joint in soft soil. Isuspect that they will fail just as easily in sand. These werebrand new items!"
5,sublime,"I'm so happy that I found Van Hunt's music. It's been a long time since I fell in love with an album. It is one of those rare discs where every song is amazing! Sexy, playful, romantic, hopeful are some of the words that come to mind...I too am annoyed that every soul artist that comes out is described as sounding like Prince, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, etc. It seems we don't have a real vocabulary to talk about new soul without comparing it to the old-school stuff. Van Hunt's music is pure and sincere. For the haters, there is *nothing* ordinary or conventional about it. Yes, he's good-looking and incredibly sexy (I've met him in person), but don't discount that. Sexual energy and passion carry his music far. I hope Van Hunt stays around for a long time.p.s. The album is so impressive, it doesn't seem possible that the live show could surpass it, but it does. Go see him live! You will be blown away."
3,"Not The Next Prince or Marvin, But It Is Decent","This CD is not the next best thing since sliced bread,or the second coming. Comparisons to Prince and Marvin Gaye are crazy since this is Van Hunt's debut album. I do like the album, I do think however the other reviewers are just going a tad overboard with comparisons to legends. A decent CD."
3,"pretty Good set, but sounds like alot of other cats",i was curious to hear this Album&I finally got to.He seems like a cross between NEo-Soul&Cats from back in the day.He has Talent in His Instrumentation.vocally He is decent but I don't get all Hyped on debut sets anymore.this set to me is about 2&h2half to me. now a couple albums from now I'll see where he is.right about Now He seems like a Eric Benet fill in&Lenny Kravitz&a few other cats who have that similar Vibe.
3,Hard to follow,"I dig the songs but the lyrics for the most part are angry or hurt feelings, almost like he doesnt want to be happy. This feels like break up music at times and then the he sprinkles a few happier songs. Could be just me, but give it a shot."
3,I'm just not getting it.,"I bought this CD because of all the buzz I kept hearing about 'this new soulful brother'. What a disappointment for me. I just cant seem to get into this CD at all. I'd heard ""Dust"", Seconds of Pleasure"" & ""Down Here In Hell"" on XM radio before buying it so I guess I was already 'conditioned' to hearing the 3 but other than those, I'm not really feeling this CD. Reading all these great reviews on here makes me wonder what you all are hearing that I'm not. Maybe I'm just not grown enough. You wanna hear some real soulfulness? Do yourself a favor and go get Anthony David(3 Chords & The Truth)also out of Atlanta. Now thats a soulful brotha. 3 Chordes is a Masterpiece of work"
5,Van surpasses the hype!,"After hearing Van on KCRW's stream for weeks now I was all over San Francisco looking for his album on the 24th. I had heard most of the tracks already and was loving his vibe. Many of the cuts KCRW played were different versions then those on the album so I was soulfully surprised to hear these funky, more layered versions. As much as I always hope for live drumming to become more prevalent on records, the beats van and his fellow producers laid down were perfect for the tunes. I hear the influences of everyone from Prince to Muddy. As always, I burned my favorite 3 tunes and sent them out to friends and family to encourage them to buy the CD. The hype is spreading and so is the love. Get this guy a good live band and send his ass out on the road!"
5,Now THIS is what a CD should sound like!,"I got this CD and hour ago, and it's already one of my favorites. I am absolutely floored. I didn't think the CD would be that good. There isn't a song that I don't like (that does not happen often). The songs are arranged perfectly, the voice is strong, the lyrics are often thought provoking, and the music is wonderful. An absolutely amazing CD, especially for a debut. Please do not sleep on this young man. He's extremely talented and I'm ALREADY looking forward to hearing more from him. If you're a fan of Neo Soul, Funk, or R&B, you will LOVE this album."
4,Really Good Album,Van Hunt Has had better songz but this was an emotionally charged album. He really put some heart into the project although he coulda mixed it up a little with a few featuring artists. Overall its an outstanding album good for easy listening.
4,tremendous book,"i study english language at faculty of philosophy in rijeka, croatia and we have to read books to improve our vocabulary. i chose this one and i was totally surprised. i love it so much! it gives a great account of america in the 60's but it also gives a warm story about a man and a dog!it could be read as a travel book, as a realistic fiction etc. i recommend it to everyone who enjoy reading absolutely great books!"
2,review of Travels with Charley,"John Steinbeck sees the United States in another special angle or we may say in his personal angle. In John Steinbeck's book, Travels with Charley, he sees the America as a humanistic person more than a high-develop industrial country. So he focuses on the people instead of the constructions. He goes into the countryside, because in his eyes this is the root of America. In his travel, the customs and the ways the American live are the landscapes. He avoids or at least try to avoid the big cities. He would rather drive on a local than drive on a high way. In his trip the thing he tries to find or to see in the root of America."
3,Bland,"I didn't quite get the feel of America that I wanted to. Perhaps I'm too stuck on Kerouac and his pace. The words were there but the feeling wasn't. Suggest ""Grapes of Wrath"" to anyone interested in getting to know Steinbeck."
2,Book damaged,"The book was not in EXCELLENT condition. The first few pages w title and copyright information, etc were torn out."
5,A Great American Road Trip,"In this wonderfully entertaining book, Steinbeck takes a road trip across America and back, exploring its geography, culture, religion and society. In the process he explores the very nature of travel, why so many of us are so drawn to it and how that affects our lives. Travels with Charley in Search of America is similar in some respects to Steinbeck's 1948 A Russian Journal, although here the writing is somewhat more about America than A Russian Journal was about Russia. This book is also very different in that here Steinbeck travels with his dog as his only companion, whereas A Russian Journal was about travels with Steinbeck's close friend Robert Capa.This book is a very thought-provoking and entertaining exploration of many aspects of America. I highly recommend it."
1,This book deserves less than one star,"This is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life, and I have read quite a few books. How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt. It is very good if you are an insomniac, though."
1,Worst book ever,"I am completely indifferent to Steinbeck, no biases, nothing, but I would have to say that this is by far the worst novel that I have ever read. Long, dull depictions of possibly the dryest parts of America dominate this book, along with not-so-clever interactions between Steinbeck and his dog, Charley. Though for a novel this book may be short, it certainly could have ended about 200 pages before it did and we would have gotten the message: geography and people influence each other, and it is obvious that Steinbeck traveled only through the wastelands of America."
3,Spending too much time with a dog?,"Dogs are great companions but they have their limitations - namely the present. I know Steinbeck is tongue-in-cheek in some places, such as when he has a conversation with Charley, but it's not clear when he is and when he's not. I suspect it wasn't clear to him either.Some examples: ""Charley was torn three ways - with anger at me for leaving him, with gladness at the sight of Rocinante, and with pure pride in his appearance.""""I saw the look of veiled contempt in Charliey's eyes."" ""...trying to make himself look small.""This is not to say he doesn't hit the nail on the head in quite a few places, e.g. how Charley gets him up in the morning. There have been days when I open my eyes in the morning and the first thing I see is a black nose two inches from my nose!I didn't find Steinbeck's human interactions paticularly interesting so if you're not interested in dogs, don't bother."
2,"Good book, missing page","The book was excellent, except for the missing page. I had to return it and I am still looking for another centennial edition."
4,Best of the Originals,The last voyage of the original cast and crew was one that will not be forgotten. The DVD enhances the experience even more. There is also a teaser trailer on this DVD that is most interesting. Don't pass this opportunity up.
3,"Not top Trek, but worth the price.","The movie was good. The DVD video quality was disappointing, but acceptable. The worst part was the dearth of DVD extras. The weakest part of the plot was its heavy reliance on surprises to create interest: This succeeds for the initial viewing, but makes replays considerably less interesting. Besides the anomalies mentioned in previous reviews, there is also the question of why the shape-shifter didn't bother proving her(?) identity to the Klingons by shifting her shape."
4,Fine Trek,"Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good."
3,Good but not Great,"""Star Trek VI"" is a good solid movie. It is not however a great one. While an improvement over Trek V, I think many people saw this entry as a return to the glorious days of Treks II,III, and IV. This film delivers what you come to expect from Star Trek, space action, interesting effects, good banter and a Klingon conspiracy. It's all good stuff, we've just seen it all before. This time the fun seems routine.What is distressing here is everything is constructed to be the last classic Trek adventure. Why? The box office was still strong, even stronger than two of Next Gen's offerings. What is sad is that Kirk, Spock and the gang are being brushed aside for the adventures of a younger crew. Well at least they did it with some style. The last line of Star Trek VI brings the classic Trek series to an appropriate end."
2,A very difficult read.,"In his introductory ""Who Should Read This Book"" section, the author says ""If you're new to programming, welcome!"" May I suggest instead, ""Run for your life."" I try to imagine reading this book as a neophyte programmer, and I just shudder.Although the author covers a lot of ground, wisely leaves the reader to search the SunSoft documentation for details where appropriate, and offers many insightful developer-oriented tips, I find his presentation very confusing. Errors in the code samples, cross-references, figures, and text just make things worse. Also, MacMillan/Sams Publishing seems unable to post the sample code files on their website, as promised in the book. And don't bother with the author's email or website. They don't work, and neither does the editor's email.As a C++ developer moving to Java, I'm beginning to understand why programmers often speak of all the Java books on their bookshelves. This one starts my collection. Next..."
3,Good Catch-up but now out of date,"Yep, it's a recap of the last years magazine articles. Not bad if you need to get a clue what's up with the most recent pc hardware. It will explain the difference between the north bridge and the south bridge and other tech stuff you need to know. Lot's of reviews of last year's products (now available for great deal prices). I'd buy the latest one, the 2006 buyer's guide. Like reading a whole year's worth of the magazine."
4,A Journey,"Attila A Barbarians Bedtime Story is a uniquely written book by Peter Hargitai. In this book we are taken through a journey with a boy who leaves his communist country as a boy to be free as man. This book is a collection of drama, sarcasm, fantasy, reality, and illusions. I was honored to have had the pleasure of reading this book so wonderfully written by a talented author."
3,journey of manhood,"Attila was a book filled with vivid imagery and visual word content that made it easier for readers to imagine Attila's pain, joy, and strange state of mind. He takes us on a journey through the trials of his life that include his flee from a Communist Hungary to an independent America, and the heartache in between. The part I thoroughly enjoyed was the plane crash and the feeling of despair and anxiety that arose from searching for the lost baby."
4,"Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine, Reviews of 40 Used Boats Plus a Detailed Look at Ten Great Used Boats","As expected from Sailing Magazine, a well written and comprehensive guide in the selection of great used sailboats. Covers all of the pluses and the minuses of 40 'classic plastic' sailboats from small to large. Of particular interest is the review of things to look for and problems that exist as well as performance and accomidations."
2,Not that great,"The cup size runs too small, i had cheaper nursing bras doing a way better job than this one"
3,Fixed social scene,"3 1/2Go! brought a youthful, unabashedly cynic-free enthusiasm to the indie scene with their clever usage of cheer vocals wrapped around a highly engaging cocktail of unpretentious, spirited instrumentation. Perhaps the only aspect that brings this consistent charmer down is poor production, translating all this urgent energy with treble-centric distractedness."
4,Heard them live,I discovered The Go Team when they gave a live radio performance on KCRW in Los Angeles and I found myself going back on website to listen to it over and over again. The chants and the catchy music is what grew on me. I hope i get to see them live one day. I'm excited to buy their CD. They performed about 6 songs on the radio performance so I know most of the songs to give them a thumbs up.
1,Read the book instead,"Just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children; movies have ratings for a reason. This movie is rated PG-13, which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for young children. In this case, it is crude humor.What I don't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience, and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience shouldn't see it."
5,Loved it!,"I loved the wit and humor in this movie. The animals stole the show. How did they make the expressions of the animals match so well to what they were saying? Really well done family entertainment, which is so hard to find these days."
5,A GREAT VIDEO TO GET THE KIDS FOR CHRISTMAS!,"We laughed so hard watching this movie! It was fun-filled and fresh. Definitely a movie to watch with your kids...but get some tasty, buttered popcorn and icy-cold soda for refreshments BEFORE the movie starts so you don't miss a thing! It's great to watch Eddie Murphy in this entertaining role. This movie has a nice family appeal to it. We highly recommend it!"
4,A West Virgiania Libraian,"i thought this was a hilarious movie, Eddie Murphy plays Dr. Dolittle who discovers he has the ability to talk to animals.Hilarity ensues."
2,This movie wasn't too good.,"Dr. Doolittle wasn't too good of a movie. It claims to be very funny but only some parts were actually funny. Most of the movie, Eddie Murphy tries to figure out what is wrong with him and finally at the end he figures out that he wants to able to talk to animals. I give this movie 2 stars."
1,This movie is an insult to the original!,"This movie is an insult to the original version. When movies star rude, obnoxious people like Eddie Murphy instead of Rex Harrison who sings and dances happily, there is definately something wrong! Stores need to sell the original movie instead of this horrible imitation."
4,Cute,This is a very cute toy and I love that it plays a counting song. Great price too! My only complaint is that it only plays the one song. It would be a lot more interesting and fun if it played a few songs. Overall I'm happy with it.
1,Too difficult,"The picture of the pod is intriguing, that's why I bought the product for my son. However, the assembly is very difficult due to the paper weight being insufficient. The tabs are not strong enough to push through the slots and so they fold and come apart. The instructions are with a white model so they are difficult to understand. I needed to use lots of tape to keep this thing together."
5,Outstanding! You won't find a better SQL Server admin book.,I've bought several sQL server books in the past. This is the ONLY sql book that I actually use. Its a great guide and reference and it has answered every SQL Server question I've ever had (so far). I highly recommend this book.I don't think you'll find a better book to get you through the day to day admin tasks. The book also covers lots of advanced subjects and it does so extremely well.
5,Very helpful,"This is a very helpful book. Concisely put together, I find it's my only reference I use to learn how to use our SQL server installation. The book gets me started in the right direction, then I'm able to figure things out on my own."
1,Bad American Gay Cinema,"Slow paced, bad acting, all about the aspiring actors in a really poor script. Not worth watching. I am dissapointed at american gay films, you see depth in international films, where characters are complex and they just happen to be gay. In american films, we are seeing the same formula, boy has crush on another cute boy and there is drama.I wish we could see better american gay films."
1,terrible!,I got a new camera and I have thought she was notworking because this brand new memory card wasntworking... add few $$$ and buy san disc likeI did later
1,Doesn't fit.,Amazon lists this as a memory card for the Garmin Nuvi 500. It is physically too big. Buyer beware--don't count on Amazon to know what accessories work with the products they sell.
5,First BB gun.....,"When I first got this gun in my front door I was so happy to unbox it. I decided to take it out for a test and I was pretty damn excited to use it, everything hit or flew as perfect as it would, but it's not super accurate, it's good enough. Racking the slide get's annoying, if they fixed that, this gun is perfect for the price it's one of the best and realistic if it didn't have the Orange tube... Great purchase, enjoyed. ^_^"
3,Big Liddell Better in Digital Form,"The Big Liddell is a very valuable resource, as a number of other reviewers here have observed. It truly is the premier work of its kind. But it has a few drawbacks.1 - The sheer weight and bulk of this tome makes it a dedicated desk reference. In fact, you might consider building a special shelf or desk just to hold the book.2 - The offset printing flaws mentioned by other reviewers is a significant problem. Portions of some entries are not even legible.The Big Liddell is the kind of book that would be much more valuable in digital format than in print. There's been talk about an electronic version for some time, and it looks like we might finally get one soon ..."
4,Enduring Freedom,"This wasn't the best in the series, but it was pretty good. I'm going to miss this series if no more are written, I like how the author puts two family lines from the beginning to the last one. I don't know if I'll read the submarine series yet."
2,Beginner book on TCL/TK - very little web programming,"I was very disappointed in this book. The title suggets that the book covers tcl programs for the web. I was expecting sockets, http, ftp, etc.. There is a total of 4 pages that deals with sockets. Some good coverage on tclets but minimal. The vast majority of the book (90%) deals with the various widgits in tk and tcl programming constructs. A good book for beginners to tcl/tk but very little on web development"
3,Good for a beginner video,"This is a great dvd for the BEGINNER. By the description, one would think that it would be a bit more advanced. This is perfect for someone that hasn't done yoga before. Her style is easy to follow & pleasant. The second dvd with no talking seems a bit silly, because if you are in the pose, you constantly have to position yourself to see the television in order to know when to go to the next posture. This should be marketed for new students - anyone else will be looking for more of a true flow."
5,"Great ""cans"" ! (in audiospeak)","My good ol' Sony MDR-V6's finally gave up the ghost, so I was in the market for a replacement. After comparing endless reviews and specs, I figured I'd take an educated chance on these. (JVC for headphones? Whodathunkit? I began my search w/the usual suspects- Sennheiser,Koss,Sony etc.).I strongly recommend these! They have 50mm drivers (which helps in every way) and have a wide frequency response (12-25k Hz. which is beyond the 20-20 audible spectrum- get an extra pair for your dog!). I was tempted to get the HAG77's, but the only difference is that the frequency response is even wider (10-25...get this extra pair if you have space alien friends!).Happy listening!8-)"
3,"It is ok, but nothing special","It is ok but nothing special; the quality is not so great.They cannot make the software to work fine, just ok.They made a simple thing more compliacted.I wish someone makes a REALLY good touchpad mouse-one-day."
3,lock and key set.,"This item is good for locking stuff up, i recommend going to Enco.com to get this item and avoid HUGOS ONLINE, they make you wait a month and then you receive nothing."
5,A Classic in the Making,"I have just closed the cover after finishing Mr. Hill's latest novel. I have not read such a book in a very long time. It made me laugh until I cried, and it made me sad enough to crytime after time. The characters became friends; I sat with them in their homes and work places and learned to think of them as people I knew. Mr. Hill's character development is superb. He made me change my mind about the characters several times. His insights into the meanings of love, family, and the pain of change are remarkable. The wisdom of the people brings new wisdom to the reader as well. This is a remarkable story about remarkable people. I thank the author for sharing. I only hope I get to go to Brownsville again."
4,Review By: Trevor T. Morris,I recently was in a discussion group with the author and my class on the book It's all about the moon when the sun ain't shining. I thought this book was very interesting and would suggest it to anyone who like to read a good book especially one based in Louisiana. The author who turned out to be quite a character explained different details from the book which i found to be quite interesting. I loved the book!!!
4,Not For Short People,"This chair comes packed in a sturdy, nylon totebag with a heavyduty strap for easy carrying. I pulled it out and set it up within two seconds. The chair itself was comfortable. However, the pillow is too high and too thick for my head. The muscles in my neck started to strain immediately. So, I inched myself up a little bit and it felt better. But I couldn't imagine sitting in it for any great length of time.My husband, who is six inches taller than me, came in and sat in the chair. It was fine for him. He liked the fact that it naturally reclines and that it has built-in drink holder. I would recommend this chair for anyone 5'8"" tall and up."
1,Footrest tore away on both sides the first time we used it,"The appears to be a very sturdy chair and folds nicely for carrying and storage. However, the first time we used it, the fabric straps binding the footrest to the chair tore away, leaving the footrest part unusable. This was not due to rough usage - I sat in the chair, put my feet up to relax and all of a sudden, both bindings tore off and the footrest fell to the ground. Don't know if it was defective or what, but it is being returned."
5,Gotta start somewhere....,"This book opened my eyes to a lot of valuable info, and I began reading it right before my first acting class started. It put me that much further ahead of my classmates. I recommend this to anyone who has a list of unanswered questions and no clue where to begin."
3,SAME RIFFS OVER AND OVER,"I am a big fan of Santiago Jr and Flaco, but this is a rather repetitive CD. Bajo Sexto thumps away using similar rhythms in almost every tune. I think some of his later work is better because there is more variety. Of course, if you're a big fan, then every CD is a treat....This one is just a little boring. Sorry Santiago!"
3,"nice music but quite a bit like ""elevator"" music.","The music in Higher Ground is pretty music but I wouldn't call it New Age music.The instrumentals are nice but to me, it sounds a lot like ""Muzakian"" or ""elevator"" music.It would be perfect to have as background music for a gathering or background music while having a nice dinner with friends or family."
3,vroom! vroom!,"love the style, but if you need fine control over mouse motions pick another mouse, the mouse cursor ""jumps"" sometimes and the scroll wheel acts funny every now and then. Not a problem for web browsing or selecting text, but if I was a regular Photo Shop user it would probably be annoying."
5,"Good Binoculars, Good Quality",When I ordered these binoculars I was a little skeptical. Being that they were not as expensive as some others I was worried they might not be good quality but when they arrived and I tried them out I soon realized that they were indeed a good binocular and the quality was very good. I am so glad I ordered these. They will be used on many family vacations and bird watching in my yard. They are not heavy and easy to focus. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,Its a great book to read,"I think the book is the best of them all. It takes all the characters form the first two books and puts them in this one. The book is basicly about a girl named jessica who writes about vampires not knowing that there real. So another vampire comes to check things out his name was aubrey. He sences a vampire aura from her. But he doesn't know why, as he starts to fall in love with her.As another vampire is trying to kill her. I can't tell you the end but it is good. So read it."
2,"Again, I am disappointed","Okay, all you Amelia Atwater-Rhodes fans, don't jump all over me! ;) We are all allowed to have our own opinions. I was expecting a lot more from this book, and was truly hoping that the author would have matured more since her first book.Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Although longer than the first book, there still wasn't much to sink your teeth into, so to speak. I also found this book to be a little self-indulgent, on the author's part, similar to what Anne Rice does on occasion (not in a good way). I am sorry if my opinion does not mesh with yours, but I am entitled to it. I gave Amelia two chances, and even though I am a fan of horror, I probably won't read the next one."
2,Demon in My View,"I give this book a two because I give the girl credit - she's a tad older than I am but she has no real experience writing. I don't give her any more than two stars because she HAS NO REAL EXPERIENCE IN WRITING. I've been reading adult/young adult fiction for going on three years now and I know the plots can be drippy and shallow - especially for the fantasy genre. But this... this is beyond shallow. I read it in an hour and a half (which completely kills my habit of reading a book in the wee hours of the night to the wee hours of the morning). The characters have no personalities. The plot is predictable, boring, and something that ANY high schooler could have written. I admit, I see potential. I would advise Amelia Atwater-Rhodes to fine tune that potential, take a writing course, and then her next novella will be better. She could be the next Ann Rice. But I doubt anyone would've wanted to read what Ann Rice wrote when she was thirteen."
3,Not the best book ever,"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a talented writer but she is still pretty young and her stories reflect that. ""In the Forests of the Night"" was an enjoyable, if rather un-original vampire story.However Demon in My View is more obnoxious because the whole Mary-Sue like similarites between Amelia and the protagonist Jessica-basically she seems to have written this book so that she could fall in love with Aubrey and become a vampire herself. Amelia's talent for writing keeps the book afloat but it still not that great. Hopefully she will improve her plots as she gets older."
5,Amazing,"This book, for me, was the best by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. She is indeed a great author and in this story ""Demon in my View,"" she gives you Jessica, a high-schooler who has no friends. She is haunting, and scares away all those who try to become her friend. She writes books, and wishes for the characters in her book to come out. But this can never happen...or can it? This book is a book that'll have you at the edge of your seat. Let's give this author some MAJOR credit. She wrote her first book at my age! Age 13!! Other books you should read by this amazing author : In the Forest of the Night, Shattered Mirror, and Night Predator. READ ALL HER BOOKS!"
4,my thoughts,"I've read both of her books, I found Demon more enjoyable, plus you can tell she's getting older as you read how the characters interact. I believe just about every one saw a resemblance beteen Jessica and Amelia. I thought it was nice that Aubrey seemed to mature some, and wasn't quite so arrogant and self centered (not that he wasn't fun that way too). I'm counting down to September."
3,DEMON IN MY VIEW-AMELIA ATWATER-RHODES,"A young writer gets scared when Audrey, a foe she has written of in her books, appears in her local high-school. She finds all she has written is true, and that is why other vampires want her dead. But Aubrey seems to like her...Great! A lot better than her first novella, ""In the Forests of the Night"". I liked it because it seemed to mirror her..."
1,Never Have I Read a Young Adult Book So Quickly!,"This book took me an hour to read -- one hour! Besides that it was terribly written for someone he age for that fact. It was too shallow and she couldn't go on a page without the pathetic sarcasm. Jessica sounds like a baby and Aubrey sounds like a teen who just reached puberty. It was just another sad love story with the fantasy of Amelia herself. I wouldn't suggest this, or unless you are a teen who will read anything. It was just like reading a subcription of Vogue and I hate Vogue."
5,This item made my mother's life easier,I purchased this for my mother. She was able to attach it herself and is very happy with the function of the handle. I recommend this to others with similar reaching challenges.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"This phone is terrible. No bargain here. A LOT of static and interference. It even picked up a fax machine! We tried different channels and plugged it into two different locations in our home, and it was just as bad. I have two other Uniden phones and they are great. This phone was a dissapointment, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not as good as Troll Taken,"I found it somewhat erratic, as if the author didn't fully know how to end the plot. Read Troll Taken instead, you'll enjoy it!"
2,What is McBain's fascination with this character?,"Now a whole book featuring McBain's least likeable character, Ollie Weeks. Fat Ollie's written a book and during the investigation of a mayoral candidate's murder someone steals it from Ollie's car. now the hunt is on. The murder case is pushed to the back burner as we are punished with excerpts from Ollie's book, Ollie in lust,and meeting someone even more loathsome than Ollie, his snitch the pederast Fats Donner. Enough already! Coupled with a fairly simplistic mystery, this book is McBain at his weakest, scattered and barely able to hold the interest of the reader."
5,Have used it a lot,"Small but strong. Have used it with a hammer to break up chunks of ice and have also used it to separate ice cubes that have frozen together. it's smallhas been very handy when making ice cream. The top of the wooden hammer is flat, so it's easy to use is with a hammer. It's small enough to keep in the drawer with my tableware."
1,check out the song titles before you buy this,"this cd is really and truly not very good and i strongly recommend you don't waste your money. i mean he covers ""stand by me"", ""all shook up"" and ""take it to the limit"" among others, for crying out loud. plus the entire album is acoustic and i much prefer mason on electric guitar. buy some of his studio albums which are much better."
1,what a piece of waste!,"this book goes on and on and on about the same thing. the author must love to hear him self rambling in a empty space. there is no useful information in this book. if you want to learn COM and DCOM, buy microsoft press's books."
2,Riddled with errors in examples,"After completing the first chapter's examples, I am greatly dissappointed in this book. The statement from the publisher on technical accuracy appears to be an all out lie. References to the same variable in code mysteriously change names from one code chunk to the next. The keyword 'interface' is shown as 'Interface' in the code, although no reference to the necessary macro is made. (page 20) One portion of the book is obviously a cut and pasted from another portion without the content being updated correctly for the current context!!! (page 17, step 11) In other words, as written, the examples do not compile and the steps involved are not explained correctly. If this continues in the following chapters, I will be seeking a refund on this one. Coriolis Technology was supposedly ""founded to create a very elite group of books."" Better luck next time guys."
5,Great Book,"I bought this as a baby shower gift. In my opinion this book and ""I'll Love you Forever"" are two books that should be in every parents arsenal. Not only to read to their children, but to read themselves."
2,Abridged :(,"Like someone else mentioned, this I Can Read edition is abridged. They left out a sentence or two here and there... maybe to make it easier to read? Or maybe to save a few pennies on printing. Either way, it's unfortunate.Besides that, though, this is one of my favorite children's books ever. I'm going to send this one back and buy a different edition."
4,Shades of Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle!,"Frances is a picky eater. She likes bread and jam because it's consistent.Her parents are understandably upset by this, but they deal with it in the most practical way - they give her exactly enough bread and jam to fill her up for life.The story is resolved very quickly, after only a day, but satisfyingly. ""How do you know what I'll like if you don't even let me try it?"" indeed."
2,"Low quality. Had to use my own, much longer, screws","I'm sorry I bought these - should have bit the bullet and bought $200 metal stands from B&W or whoever, instead of wasting $89 on these. The build quality is very poor. You have to attach a platform to the top and bottom of each stand. 3 of the 4 were ok, the 4th one didn't ""take"" and I had to drill a new, deeper hole and use a much longer screw. I don't feel safe with my speakers on these things, they're still a bit wobbly. AVOID. Would send them back but not worth the hassle - and shipping charges - at this point."
5,Time to Rock!,"This albun sounds great!This band really has got something magic! The first two songs are amazing!Wasted years,written by the great gitar plaier Adrian Smith will drive you crazy!The lyrics are wonderful and Adrian playing his guitar on this song is something unbelievable,awesome!You've got to isten to this! ""Heaven can Wait"" is another wonderful song! This albun rally rocks!It is a great opurtunity to listen to the band in their great moments!"
2,"Not bad, but not too good either","I'm a Maiden fan, but frankly, was a little disappointed with this one. Wasted Years is a good song, but other than that, I don't see anything special here. I recommend earlier albums like Killers, Number of the Beast, and Powerslave. I enjoyed Fear of the Dark as well."
2,Iron Maiden and Synthesizers don't mix,"This was the first Iron Maiden album which was not great. This album marked a very big change in the band's music. On Somewhere in Time, keyboards were very evident on the album. There are some good songs on this album like Deja Vu, Sea of Madness and Stranger in a Strange Land, but there are also some awful songs like Heaven Can Wait and The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner. If you are want to get into Iron Maiden, don't buy this one first I would reccomend KILLERS of PIECE OF MIND to start off with. If you already enjoy the early Iron Maiden albums, give this one a shot."
3,Wasted Years is the only true gem,"Bruce's voice seemed a little shaky on this one, and the whole thing sounds kind of rushed. Understand that I really like NOTB, POM, PS, and SSOSS, but this just kind of sits a bit below. Pretty good instrumentals, as usual, but I really don't care about Alexander the Great, and the lyrics are so-so. I was listening to IM and Killers back in the early 80's, so it's not like I'm not a Maiden fan (otherwise I wouldn't have spent so much $$ getting my old Maiden's on cds). And I like a lot of songs since SIT, but mostly just 1-3 songs per cd. Buying a cd for that is just wasteful unless you're a collector. This one's $14... I should have downloaded Wasted Years (one of my all-time favorites) and saved $13. It's not fair to only be rated by IM fans that will rate 4-5 stars no matter what, so I must drop it down a notch. Go ahead and rip on me if you must, but there's no real accounting for personal taste. And at 3 stars, it's not like I don't enjoy it at all."
3,Not as good as their first album,The band is eclipsed in their first album. This album did not impress me much at first with not much singing as I thought there should have been. When getting the album from cassette to cd I had renewed interest in the band and the songs had different meaning and seemed more classic metal than before. The new line-up as I learned along the way had Bruce on vocals now and does a decent job but again it is nowhere near the consistency in terms of atmosphere and picture as Iron Maiden's first album. The album cover and art is A+ and the music does compliment the original art and that I will give credit due. The long distance runner is a great song with open ended drumming and soloing on guitars that keeps in best compliments with the original Iron Maiden structure. I would say that is the best song on the album.
4,Good But Not Their best But A Ture Classic,"I Find theme of the album cover discribes the music perfectly along preety much with all the other maiden covers the only thing that might be a turnoff for some fans is the keyboards, Synths, but it's still maiden in their prime so give them a chance."
4,Good Book,"This book nicely sums up Emma Goldman's anarchistic views and gives you a good sense of her as a person. Few people lived as such an embodiment of radicalism as ""Red Emma"". Still, she's something of a theoretical lightweight -- her reputation as a vocal hellraiser overshadows her contributions to anarchist theory, particularly when you compare her to Voltairine de Cleyre, the other prominent (but overlooked) anarchist feminist of that time."
3,The increibly long contributed essay nearly killed this.,"It's an interesting read, but the all caps German words and other ""key words"" made obvious by being in all caps with no foot notes or even dictionary definitions available in the Kindle's dictionary make it a bit of an annoying read. The all caps stuff looks like really bad name-drop marketing ploys like you're pointing out the ""product"" uses this brand of component and the salesman is saying that like it's a great thing, but it's a brand you've never heard of.There's a lot of good material and history here, I certainly liked reading about what was going on in the world back then, but the framing of the essay in general just didn't really work all that well.Great read for history, but not so much for just passing the time."
3,Book doesn't flow well,"Although everything is in this book it doesn't flow well and leads to a difficult read. There are too many ""cut and paste"" definitions from Cisco manuals. I'd wait for the Cisco Press book on Multicasting."
2,Barebones re-release,"The He-man and She-ra Christmas Special has a special place close to my heart. This is why it makes me so sad to see such a barebones release. This DVD has absolutely no extras (well, it does have a chapter selection?). This is not even a remastered transfer. What makes this edition even more redundant is the fact that in 2005 there was another version that was loaded with extras.Skip this release as theHe-Man & She-Ra - A Christmas Special(2005) is the one you want. Unfortunately, it is out of print, but you can still get it from some sellers (albeit at a slightly higher price)."
5,Great introduction to Java,"I am an ASP/SQL Server developer, and wanted to learn Java. I started reading two others and just gave up on them. This was the first book on Java that helped me understand the concept behind the language and how everything fits together. As a beginner to Java (but not to programming), I liked how it gave me a broad introduction to a variety of topics. I now have at least a bit of a clue about JSP, Servlets, and EJB. I am also pleased that this book covered Swing, the new GUI toolkit. Thanks to this book, I now feel competent in the language and can move on to more advanced stuff."
3,NOT A BAD CHOICE FOR BEGINNERS,"This book would have been hard to fault, had its authors sustained that narrative outlook which the early chapters displayed. Still, I would not be quick in writing it off. There are some promising signs in it.Its mild approach to J2SE is commendable. It also excelled in the manner it introduced Network clients and Servers. However, the JavaBeans aspect of it is not very straightforward.Overall, this is a good book for any Java beginner; although that I would say that ""Java in a Nutshell"" is a lot better than it."
2,"Good action scenes, most everything else is dull and bland","No Escape isn't exactly meant to be a fascinating look at our future. It wants to be a turbo-charged action/adventure, and even at those levels it doesn't quite succeed. Granted, the movie has 2 very exciting action sequences, particularly the opening chase sequence and the big battle between the two rival colonies on the island. However, just about everything else is dull, bland, and lifeless. Everything is done in a routine manner that it just gets boring after a while. This isn't worth watching, and not fast-paced enough as an enjoyable action film."
5,One of the best action/adventure movies,"This movie is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. So what if there are no women at all in the film, this movie has something for every action lover. It has scenes, themes, and weapons reminiscent of both primitive and futuristic times. The enemy is smart and ruthless, but Liotta's character is every bit as smart. The final fighting scenes make the whole movie worthwhile. This is a must see!"
2,Too many errors in examples and answer key,"As a review of algebra, this might be an acceptable practice book. However, there are several errors in the example problems throughout the book, and the answer key has numerous errors, sometimes multiple errors on one page. I would not recommend this book except possibly as extra practice or review of material already learned. The publisher needs to reprint it with corrections, though."
5,To honor my professor,Martha Rhodes was my professor and mentor at Sarah Lawrence; I couldn't pass this book up!
5,Who We are,"An Amazing little book. It digs a bit in to who as Americans We are and what We owe our mother country. The Author is well written and thought out. The only fault I wish he would have written more.If you Love our Culture and Heritage as Anglo Americans, I highly recommend this book. You will have alot of food for thought. One has a lot of information on how our ways came about. How our laws developed, Our form of Government came about and also a bit on how we need to save our Heritage.Buy this book as Trust me you will thank me."
1,Don't bother!,"After reading mixed reviews, I purchased this product. It was to be used outside but wasn't tried out until several months later. BIG MISTAKE! I'm sure the HAW300RF is as bad. If you turn your head, you lose the signal even well within range even in the same room! Garbage!"
3,Interesting,"This book was very interesting to read, it was straight to the point. It had a little suspense to it also which i enjoyed. It makes you want to finish it. You want to know what is going to happen to the characters. Wihtout giving anything away the ending was also great. So in a nut shell it's worth it. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Unsolicited nonsense!,"I just received this unsolicited book in the mail. I was hoping for a good laugh, ala Jack Chick tracts, but there were none to be found. It was, however, kind of amusing to see one Christian sect accusing the other of misinterpreting their imaginary buddy.It was free and not even worth that much.If you're determined to waste your money, I have a pink unicorn I'll sell you."
2,Uninspired,"There is nothing that Hugh Cornwell has produced in many years to compare with the work he did with the good 'ol boys back in the day. It's time he gets back with them, maybe before ol' Jet cashes in? The other fellas have been more to old energetic form the last several years. Maybe Hugh could add to them once again. On his own he hasn't done much interesting. The live versions of old Stranglers songs here lack energy or anything exciting. The Nosferatu tracks are the only highlight. I might have liked to hear ""One In A Million"", another from his own recordings from years ago. I wonder if he plays it at all anymore?"
5,RTI A3 Stand,Works well with my Polk RTI A3 Speakers. I added some blu tac to the speaker to attach to the stand and it works very well. I'm using the carpet spikes and they keep the stand sturdy.
4,Good quality but just a bit lacking visually.,These stands are very good. They are a bit small for the speakers I put on them but I knew that before buying them so I can't take that away in a review. The only concern I have with these is that one of the stands when put together is not completely square and it is noticeable. I don't think my wife knows or many other people since they don't build stuff like I do and have an eye for it. However I know that it is off and it bugs me so that is the reason for the four stars on construction and appearance. The actual build quality is very sturdy. I don't worry about these getting knocked down. I have bumped into them multiple times and they don't budge. The wire control system on the back isn't necessary but I have one of the plastic things on just to keep the wires in line not to hide them. I would definitely buy these again especially if I knew that I just got a bad stand that isnt the usual.
3,"Well, it holds speakers.","I use this to hold my B&W 685 speakers which it has been doing for at least 5 months now. The speaker base plate is a 6 inch by 6 inch square, and looks too small for my speakers. The actual height of the stands is 28 to 28 1/2 inches, not the advertised 30. The included carpet spikes are useless on my carpet which pulls up relatively easy. I would not recommend these speaker stands for use around kids or in similar environments."
4,a wondeful live concert for brazilian music fans,"as one of the top brazil female artists, daniella mercurys music is enjoyable to many. she has traveled intly and gained a large following. this concert put out by mtv, is enjoyable. i found that the stage prescence on the dvd was not as busy as i would have liked though. i mean by this, that the dancers were rare and in between, not during the bulk of the songs, and most of the stage prescence was her alone singing or somewhat dancing. however, there was a number of other interesting parts, including ile aye, a group of afro brazilian dancers who came out in costume, and some extra artists who joined the performance. overall i give it 4 stars because the music contained is a lot of her best songs in one live version."
3,Good Solid 3 Stars +,"Comparisons to the Replacements will be inevitable, since Mars was that band's drummer. Replacement fans will be pleased, if not quite blown away with ""Horseshoes and Handgrenades."" The songwriting here shows Mars to be close to former bandmate and Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg in lyrical wit, melodic pop leads, and catchy hooks. His voice is a bit raspy and lacks the range and vocal nuance of Westerberg's but is up carrying the material, if not taking it a step higher. Mars plays most of the instruments except bass, and again shows himself to be accomplished beyond the drum kit in showcasing the melodies and turning the hooks. The more I listened the better I liked this set of tunes and Mars' treatment of the material. For Replacement fans, this is a worthwhile addition to your collection. For those seeking an introduction to that band and its players, I'd recommend ""Tim"" or ""Pleased to Meet Me,"" both masterful examples of power pop."
5,"A very creepy, and surprisingly artistic, movie!","This type of fairy tale movie is more in tune with what fairy tales were meant to be originally: stories that scared children into being good, virtuous, and unquestioning.I saw this movie by chance when I used to have Tivo and it was randomly recorded as a suggestion. I remembered thinking, ""What the heck?"" but was amazed when I actually watched it! It became an instant favorite.Morbid, creepy, and dark, yet also engaging with lots of pretty eye-candy fall colors, gorgeous costumes, and artistic cinematography. Plus, so much fun to see Sigourney Weaver in such a different role--she made a scary stepmother!"
5,really creepy,"This movie is awesome! It really keeps your attention--me and my friends usually fall asleep when we watch movies, but not this one! It's not that it's really gory, it's more creepy & suspenseful than horror. The main girl is so pretty! I love that she's pale with dark hair & still really gorgeous."
2,Should've been better.,"This was an interesting take on the fairy tale, but couldn't fully pull off the attempt. The movie seemed to be forced along from scene to scene without the moments being able to naturally evolve. I'm not sure if it was poor direction or just personal preference, but Weaver's character seemed like it needed to be more external, rather than the quiet crazy. Her ability doesn't shine until she is covered in latex and prosthetics.All in all, it was okay, but I have no desire to see it again. Spending $2.99 to watch it on-line was all the money I would like to spend on this movie."
2,Disappointing,"Rich scenery and some talented actors- it's hard to explain how this fell so flat. But, the truth is, my husband fell asleep and I was bored-is there anything else to say?. Snow White was an unlikeable brat (and expressionless character). The supposedly evil step-mother was the most sympathetic character in the movie (great acting by Sigourney). The dwarves weren't dwarves-why? Mostly it was just written in a monotone. It was okay if you have nothing else to watch. Sigh."
3,"Great beginning, but poor ending","This movie is unlike any Snow White version I have ever seen or read. Unlike it's Disney predecessor, the characters in this version are not simply good or evil. Lilyanna (Snow White) is not an ever-sweet, warm, and welcoming step daughter, just as Lady Claudia (the evil queen) is not a one-minded villian whose only motive to kill snow white is her beauty.The beginning of the story offers a more complicated and more plausible explanation for Lady Claudia's hatred for Lilyanna. And while I found the beginning of the movie excellent, the ending was lacking. The story could have been ended with the same creative twist with which it began. Instead the last thirty minutes of the movie was an over-horrified bloodbath incorporating images from all sorts of terror films, like ""Cujo"", ""Night of the Living Zombies"", and ""Rosemary's Baby"".Despite its poor ending, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a fresh twist on classic tales. Just be prepared for some gore!"
5,"Superb documentary about the making of ""Apocalypse Now""","During the mid to late 1970's, Frances Ford Coppola asked his wife Eleanor to document the filming of ""Apocalypse Now"" primarily for purposes of promoting the film. She did and in 1990, additional interviews were conducted with various cast and crew members who worked on the film. The documentary details with great depth the difficulty of the shoot and the near despair and collapse of Coppola. It is if hurdles were thrown at him from God. Everything from the weather to the Philippine government to the lead actor's (Martin Sheen) heart attack to the miserable and cantankerous Marlon Brando. It does what great documentaries do. It is informative, interesting and entertaining."
3,necessary but frustrating,"I know of only one book that covers the JVM and the binary codes, the classfile format etc. It is known as the goldfish bowl book because of its cover, but is officially called The Java Virtual Machine. The book is frustrating because it spends so much time with the irrelevant Jasmin assembler and its syntax. You are interested in generating byte codes directly, not assembler. It leaves out much you must discover by experiment looking at generated class files, such as whether offsets are signed or absolute, where the base is etc. In its next revision, it should set the Jasmin aside in an appendix, and include examples and more precise documentation on the binary formats. The book is still valuable because it gives a fair bit of background exposition you will not find in the vmspec itself. You would use this book to understand the VM, then the vmspec to actually write code that generated or modified class files."
3,Deceptive Publisher Practice,This same book that was written for Access 95 How To. I would expect the authors who have an excellent reputation to have at least updated the methods. There has been 3 iterations of Access since this book was released I am sure there is an easier approach. I hope the author's will provide a new book instead of changing the title. This is really deceptive practice. I noticed the book has a reference that alludes to this however Buyer Beware.
3,"Nifty, but..",These little garden lights put out a beautiful glow at night BUT - they must be in full direct sun all day in order to get sufficient charge to glow at night and even then they only last about three hours (at least in my somewhat sheltered valley yard). This technology might be ready for a desert or pairie (i.e. full unobstructed sun day after day) home but it's got a ways to go for the rest of us.
5,"Awesome book, great for kids, perfect for schools!","This is an awesome pictorial with great editorial book that is awesome to read or simply thumb through to view some of the most beautiful rainforest's the world has to offer. Perfect for schools, to show kids who may have never been to or seen a rainforest what they are & why we need to protect them.Very young children will understand when explained the importance all rainforest's have for human survival, not to mention the survival of unique flora & fauna.This book would be helpful to science classes of all ages and teachers should have no problem creating study guides and exercises from it.Do not get me wrong, this book is perfect for adults too, makes a fantastic coffee table book for your guests to flip through. And would look striking on the coffee table of any home!I do not think anyone who purchases this would be disappointed. It is such a lovely book and simply gorgeous to view!"
2,Errors,There are some errors in this book. It is frustrating to try and follow the examples step-by-step because some of the screens and functions in the book do not match up with the actual InterDev 6 screens and functions. Perhaps the examples were based on a beta version of InterDev 6?
1,This Chair is bad,"It would not support 100lbs. It fell apart as soon as my hind end hit it. If your looking for an outdoors chair, DONT get this one! Just givin some info, SHADY"
1,Black Book used to mean nitty gritty.,"Instructions to make a quick buck: Take the Exchange 2000 release notes, shrink wrap them, and call it the Exchange 2000 Server Black Book. They knew we were desperate for literature. I feel so violated!"
2,Better Deadhead writing at Sugarmegs!,Tiger in a Trance (repeating Just Say No to itself over and over)? I don't think so. Deadheads probably already know the place to find the best piece of GD literature out there - http://www.sugarmegs.org Click on the Mad Hatter - he'll show you the way! It may take a little trip but the best stuff always does! You just gotta poke around...
3,"Great album, not-so-great remastering job","11-17-70 was one of my all-time favorite albums growing up in the 70s, period, and I practically wore the grooves out on my vinyl copy. That makes this remastered CD, for me, even more of a disappointment - what was a crisp, clear recording almost three decades ago now sounds like a muddy, echo-y performance recorded on a high-school basketball court. The liner notes seem to hint obliquely that they did the best they could with 25-year old tapes that have degraded over time.If you didn't fall in love with the original, this is great, raw, powerful live stuff. But for people like me who remember it, go somewhere like Amazon.com Auctions and try to get the real thing on vinyl or cassette."
4,1987 Monte Carlo,I used this wiring harness on my 1987 Chevy Monte Carlo to install a new stereo. It matched the internal wiring.
3,Rather Lopsided,"I LOVE the Graham Norton shows, and watch the current one every week. So when I read the 2-starred rating that said that all he does is juvenile x-rated humor for an immature audience I figured that person just wasn't used to his humor, that he or she was exaggerating and probably hadn't watched the whole thing. Well, if I only had this one DVD to go by, I wouldn't like Graham Norton either. It only focused on the sex stuff. I'm no prude (no, really I'm not), but his show works because it balances out the ""naughty"" stuff with the clever. He IS a great comedian. This DVD just doesn't demonstrate his well-rounded comic ability."
5,Cartman is the best!,Either you love South Park or you hate it. I LOVE IT. I have all of the Seasons and they get watched all the time. It is crude humor so if you are easily offended don't purchase this item.
1,Piss poor unoriginal mallcore,"Don't waste your time buying this garbage. This band has the worst singer, no memorable guitar hooks or riffs, some leads but isn't enough to redeem them from the hordes of crappy and redundant hardcore stylings. The bottom line is I've heard it done better by many other bands. If you want something that will expand your mind with crazy offbeats then I would recommend bands like Arsis, Dillenger Escape Plan,or anything by Mastadon. These guys suck and I have no idea why the hell they are touring with Megadeth. I hope they get booed off stage. They should have gotten Municipal Waste to open up."
1,Oh Janet!,"I Love Janet Jackson! BUT, these past few years of releases have been disappointing for me. When I was reading all the hype over her new *20* CD I was stoked! I was hoping that she would put out a Fab new CD so I could break out all my Janet Cd's and have my own private party! It came out, I rushed to buy it and the first single *Call On Me*. I was in SHOCK! It was HORRIBLE! I was so disappointed. Now I'm looking forward to her brothers new CD!"
4,Janet does the unexpected again,"Call on me did not immediately grab me when I heard it the first time. In fact, I was slightly dissapointed. After several listens it started to grow on me and now I constantly play it. I like how Janet does the unexpected for first releases (e.g., TTWLG, Got till it's gone, etc). Most people expected her to come out with a club banger. Janet and Nelly's vocals compliment each other very well along with Jermaine Dupri's laid back melody and beats. I wish the radio version (album mix) was a little longer, but I still enjoy it and the extended album mix more than makes up for the length. Nice slow introduction and anticipation for 20 Y.O."
4,Leonard Nimoy's Debut.,"I bought this movie because it was Leonard Nimoy's first film. It was ok, but certainly not an Oscar winner."
2,Surprized,"I have been a fan of Robert Crais, thats why I was VERY SURPRIZED with The Last Detective. I was dissapointed at its length at first, 300 pages, but James Lee Burke can write a great book in just 300 pages, so, maybe can Crais. I was wrong! Very dissapointing. And what was the bear thing all about?"
4,Pretty good despite a predictable plot,I read this one to the end and enjoyed it even though I knew probably a third of the way into the story what was going on. He writes well and makes you feel for his emotionally damaged heroes.
3,Elvis has left the bldg.,"This isn't a bad read, but it's not Elvis Cole. I have read all the Crais novels, including Demolition Angel and Hostage, and, like Hostage, this is more of a script than an Elvis Cole novel. And it's not a mystery either. The average reader will figure out ""who done it"" right out of the gate.I think the author has toned down Elvis a little too much. Hey, this is fiction so it's okay if the main character is a character. It isn't necessary from him to be PC - in touch with his inner self. The early Cole novels seemed more colorful and descriptive. The Last Detective is all business from the beginning - as if it had to fit in the 90 minutes the studio will allow."
2,Backsliding,"""Hostage"" was a peak for Crais; all the previous Elvis Cole stories seemed to have built up to it. ""The Last Detective"" is laden with intrusive and implausible pseudo-psychology. If I buy his next, it'll be when it's out in paper."
5,My first pair of boat shoes,It's amazingly comfortable. It took about 2-3 days to break in the leather. The arch helps support my balance when walking and the shoes ventilate really well.
5,Always Dependable!,"I love these shoes and wear them everyday to everything that I possibly can. Because I wear them so much, they wear out in about a year but they are definitely worth the money spent and a staple in any weather."
3,Review,"The shoe is a great quality shoe, however there was a mark on the top of it that would not come out. For a pair of shoes of this price, I would expect it to be perfectly clean.."
4,good item,this was a very good product the fit was good and it came in when it was supposed to all pricing was correct
3,The shoes are holding up well,I am not a boater but I have always liked this style. I where these shoes everwhere and they are holding up well so far.there didnt seem to be more than a 2 hour break-in period which was really cool. They fit my feet well. The laces arent holding up quite as well as I hoped and I have had to replace them twice but at least laces are cheap.
5,I used this book and passed the test.,"I used this book as my primary study aid. I supplemented the book with a few trips to the Books Online, and some hands-on time trying out the steps mentioned in the study guide. I really appreciated that it covered the necessary material without going on for 800 to 1000 pages.The sample test questions in this book were very representative of the exam questions I had, without just handing me the exact questions and answers.This book did the job for me. I strongly recommend it."
3,Not enough meat!,"This book is an okay supliment to another book, but alone I wouldn't expect to pass the test with it. It would be an alright book for the novice, or to just brush up on your knowledge. It does not conatin enough information on TSQL statements. Everything they go over is geared towards using Enterprise Manager. Also, it doesn't go into enough depth on many critical topics. I haven't taken the test yet, I'm getting another book. I can tell from previous MS SQL exams that this book alone will not prepare me for exam 70-028."
4,Good Stuff,"I will give it four stars because it does rock. But it is a huge rip off of Faith No More's sound. Although at times, they got it down instrumentally, I feel kinda of embarrassed for the singer trying to sound like Mike Patton.Obviously he has a good voice, but he should go with it instead of trying to sound like Mike Patton from Faith No More. It would just sound more authentic."
1,BAD MOVIE/BAD ACTING,"This movie is as bad as it gets...simplistic and predictable plot, unconvincing acting and poor writing. I saw the movie on TV...and I decided to come back and warn people not to spend their money on this movie...it is definitely not worth the time you spend watching it, much less the financial investment."
4,Letters from Rifka Review,"In the book Letters from Rifka a young girl is separated from her family when they leave for America. Young Rifka is detained in Germany because of ringworm and she is forced to watch her family leave on a ship to America without her. After her ringworm is gone she is able to travel to America on another ship without her family. During Rifka's journey to America she learns the English language, makes new friends, and experiences great tragedy when a friend is killed during a violent storm at sea. The whole story is told through letters written by Rifka back to her cousin in her homeland in Germany. Karen Hesse, who is the author of the book has written a very interesting and moving story about immigrants and their strength and longing for freedom. I recommend this book because it is a very close look at a young girl's journey to becoming a woman and overcoming adversity."
4,Excellent Jewish History Book,"Letters from Rifka is a kids novel that is a good read if you want to know more about life as a Jew in the past. Rifka is a girl whose family is trying to flee Russia's horrible treatment and go to America. Things just don't seem to work out for her and her family though and she ends up being left behind. As the title suggests, this book is written as a collection of letters to her cousin Tovah. This book has won the National Jewish Book Award by the JWB Jewish Book Council and it was rightfully earned. I recommend this story to those in grade 4 and up."
5,You have to buy good books for your family,It's a very good book for my 13'th daughter. We live in México and the english teachers recomended us to buy this book
5,Absolutley amazing...,"I have read a lot of Karen Hesse's other books and they have all impressed me. I am a big historical fiction fan, and the time period LETTERS FROM RIFKA takes place in especially interests me. This was an emotional and moving story and I cannot wait to hear more from this author. Read it- now!! Get this book now and I garantee you will breeze right through it. I loved it!"
1,It never arrived,"I paid for it, i need it next week, i've filed a claim, but still no book? How can i review a service when that service was never provided?I will update this review if and when i actually get what i paid for.James McDonald"
3,"Big Skipp needs to be skipped, Wacko is just WACK","This album overall is VERY mediocre and at best you can call ""Nolia Clap"" a single when it would have been a skipper if it was on Juvenile's CD. Big Skip has little lyrical talent, he sounds like E40 except he breathes in between lines and his rhymes are stupid, they are supposively making threats but he uses dumb metaphors. Wacko is not so hot either, his voice is really hoarsy, he stumbles over his verses, and he can't rhyme even about dumb stuff. Juvenile is the best thing to this album, the beats are really mediocre. Juvie's production is just not at the level of Ca$h Money yet. There is nothing, not a single bright spot on the album, all the songs are plain, you won't even remember any of them, ""Nolia Clap"" is suppsively the hit single but its a very plain song too. Apparently, Juvie's protege aren't doing as well as he thought they would. (with the exception of Young Buck, but hes with G-Unit now)Lyrics: CProduction: CDelivery: COverall: C"
5,Kajsa,"A music therapist I work with let me try this drum while we were visiting with a hospice patient. What a wonderful and beautiful surprise! We did not beat this drum, but rather gently shifted it back and forth making lovely ocean sounds. The therapist said she uses it to calm and relax. You can move the drum to match breathing patterns for the sick or young. I instantly ordered one for myself and my kids!"
5,Great functionality for the money,I bought this for a digital camera. It works great and I haven't lost a single photo or video. Good stuff!
2,"Slow performance, bad for large megapixel cameras","My main problem with this Compact Flash is that the ""real-time"" performance is very slow. I bought it a year ago for my 5-Megapixel camera, and it makes me wait a long time before I can take my next photo. This gets frustrating when you miss good photo opportunities.Then, I read this article which reviews Compact Flash cards, and I realized that this particular SanDisk product line is inferior.The review at DP Review says this Sandisk writes at 6x (where 'x' = 150 KB/sec). I since then, have purchased a 512MB Transcend compact flash which claims to Write at 25x. My camera works much faster now. I have borrowed my friend's IBM Microdrive and that is really fast too."
3,Good for smaller dogs,"These are good treats for smaller dogs, but my 50 pound, newly adopted hound dog was able to eat one in less than 5 minutes. I was looking for budget friendly rawhide chews and thought I would give this product a chance. The sticks are a little thinner than I anticipated. My dogs enjoys the treats, but eats them too quickly. She isn't a very aggressive chewer in general and is even missing her incisors. As a comparison, it takes her about 45 minutes to get through a knotted end, 5 inch rawhide bone.The quality of the rawhide seems good - they are made in Brazil and the packaging states that each lot is tracked. I feel comfortable giving these to my dog.I probably won't buy this again. My dog goes through them too quickly, but she still enjoys them."
1,A disappointment,"Despite compelling acting (notice the word 'acting' instead of 'dancing') from the artists, there's not much to like in this dreary pantomime masquerading as a ballet. I can see why, due to the homosexuality theme, it may be hyped in certain circles. Not in our home."
3,Overkill or Underkill?,"Good in parts but I wish it was a lot more ""up"". Peggy Suicide is fa-fa-better. I quite like Upwards at 45 Degrees, Mystery Trend, Fear Loves This Place & Tower. Necropolis is a killer track I can play over & over it's so much fun. Ahead of it's time in bleakness & a sign of a few of his albums to come I'm afraid."
4,AT LAST!!! LOST IN SPACE--AND GUY WILLIAMS!!!--IN COLOR!!!,"It's the same old story with these old movies and tv shows!The producers were always too cheap to do film in color, and so they tried to get by with the old black and white photography which nobody wants to watch today! But Irwin Allen was always just a little ahead of his time and so by the second season of LOST IN SPACE he finally got smart and switched to color, and the result is a much better show!I really don't remember ""Wild Adventure,"" but ""Blast off into Space"" and ""The Android Machine"" are two good episodes.""Blast off into Space"" has two terrific scenes with Guy Williams and his two leading ladies, June Lockhart and Marta Kirsten, and it's hard to tell who he likes best! And as usual, Guy looks terrific!This triple pack is worth the price, but the best LOST IN SPACE episodes are ""The Anti-Matter Man,"" ""The Games of Gamma IV,"" and ""Hunter's Moon.""...."
4,A cute and funny depiction of a cat's life,"A great deal of children write letters to Santa Claus. Well, now the cats are getting involved. They ask Santa what they want for Christmas. Some complain that they need a new computer because theirs is ruined because they thought the mouse was a toy. Others ask for the dog to be removed from the house. Cute!"
3,"Great music, but...","I've been a fan of instrumental music for as long as I can remember. Most of the selections on this CD are very familiar to me, and hearing them on CD promised to be a treat. BUT... the sound was not up to par. On many cuts, I heard what sounded like surface noise from LP's. It appeared they attempted to clean up the sound, but I heard the evidence loud and clear. I feel a bit cheated."
5,Good reference for little money,"If you don't know how DTP software works, don't buy this book. This is not a book that teaches you QuarkXpress. It is a book for people that know how to work the program, and need something to look up rarely used functions and keyboard shortcuts. The book does so very well. The explanations are clear, and the shortcut appendix is excellent. On top of that, it costs about half of all the other Quark books..."
1,This movie was an absolute suck fest,"I thought about rating this movie a 2 but I know that it will haunt me for the rest of my life. I seen this movie and every time I look at it, it hurt my freakin eyes. The movie takes place mostly in a psychiatric hospital and poor helpless teens are being terrorized by Freddy. But does it really matter? Because you don't care for the characters in the first place. Good let them die. The sooner they die, the sooner this movie is over. The plot had no freakin point. And the actors might as well been on drugz thru out the movie. But I must admit, the director must have some talent for making this movie as bad as it was. Almost as bad as ""The Blair Witch Project"" Do you got something to say about what I wrote? And I know you do. Please write to me at: omicron_30@yahoo.com"
4,The Original Is always The Best Nevermind Remakes.,"An improvement over the last one,To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due."
4,really good,"this movie is really great it is worth renting,i swear to ya,the acting was great,the plot was great,and i really cool ending.i didn't see it coming!"
5,"""It's the prime time...""","This was honestly one of my favorite of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies anyone who has seen this one knows the most famous one-liners from Fred Kreuger. ""Here's you big break on T.V, it's the primetime BITCH."""
3,It was OK,"I liked the other Freddy Krueger movies better because in this movie freddy didn't come up with jokes like in Freddys Dead: The final Nightmare for examle. Though it did have a better story than most of the movies, the scenes just didn't cut it."
4,great movie,This movie is an execellent movie. This is a movie that would definately scare you. plus you get great acting by Heather Lagnenkamp as she returns to her role as Nancy Thomson and by patricia Arquette who plays Kristen. and as always in his role as freddy; Robert Englund. I wouls suggest this movie to anyone.
3,"meh, pretty scary but...","this was one of the best in the series, i guess, the only problem is that it is scary near the beginning, then it just gets stupider and stupider, but an average story, and freddy is awesomeso i somewhat recomend, but i reccomend #4 instead"
4,This should have been the 2nd one!,"I am a big ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" fan, and this movie exceeded my expectations. I was thinking it was just going to be another bad sequel but, on the contrary this movie is good. Robert Englund does once again an outstanding job at being Freddie Kruegger. I was actually kind of jumpy when I was watching this movie, and that's unusual for me."
3,GOOD MOVIE TO SEE JUST ONCE,"GREAT! KINDA FUNNY,TOO.ONLY GOOD TO SEE ONCE,THOUGH.CAUSE IT GETS ANNOYING AFTER YOU SEE IT AGAIN.I DONT KNOW WHY.BUT IT WAS COOL CAUSE THE WAY FREDDY KILLED PEOPLE."
2,"Nothing special, but watchable",Freddy is on a mission to gain his revenge by killing off all the kids of the parents that torched him years ago. This sequel still has quite a number of good scares and killings which will be enjoyed by a number of fans of the series. Nancy's return also makes it a worth see. Probably one of the best Freddy sequels.
5,Best Sequel.,"This is the best sequel to the original. This should have been part two but it is three oh well. This movie stars Patricia Arquette and Heather langenkamp and John Saxon reprising their roles. This movie had great looking special effects considering the 4 million dollar budget. The best scene is when Phillip is turned into the puppet by freddy, I thought it was gross but it looked really cool. Anyways I recommend this film. After this one the 4th one the dream master was pretty good and I recommend that but the 5 and 6 th in the series were really bad I don't recommend those."
4,Now this is a sequel,This film gets back to the roots of the 1st one having kids trapped in a mental hospital with freddy after them. 2nd best film in the series
4,"Great Piano Player, Solid CD","Jools is probably the best piano player I've ever heard. No one compares to the the way he pound out tunes--that alone is reason to buy this CD. Since Jools isn't the greatest singer, he has brought in lots of great singers--even Chirs Difford who used to sing along with Jools when they both played for Squeeze. Sting's song is especially good as is ""Valentine Moon"" and ""Nobody but You."" Although I love many of the songs, some of them sound stale in comparison. For example, I don't really like the George Harrison tune, even if it is the last song he recorded."
3,Jools Holland - Big Band Rhythm and Blues,"If you are a hard core R&B junkie, you might find this a pretty good CD. Otherwise, there is little imagination in the production and arrangement of this CD. While the who's who of R&B play with Jools, the feel of this CD doesn't get past the hellos and the goodbyes. However, George Harrison's ""Horse to the Water,"" second song, is his last recording and makes the CD worth the price. Eric Clapton and Sam Brown do great jobs on their selections. 3 *** stars"
3,Entertaining Mystery,"The Encyclopedia Brown books are an entertaining read for child mystery lovers. Short stories with figuring out who-done-it at the end of each. The answers are in the back of the book, along with an explanation, to see if your guess is correct."
4,Childhood Memories,"I searched for this movie for a while. It was so worth the time and effort. I watched it on, ""The Wide World of Disney"" on Sunday night. The plot, the story, the actors were so Disney, I loved it. I also loved the fact that it was a little spooky........"
4,an old child movie,i always wanted to see this movie again but havn't been able to until now. thank you.
3,About this DVD release,"As noted in the product description, this is a Made-On-Demand DVD-R. Image quality varies from just adequate to poor (some scenes literally look like bootleg VHS!) There is no menu (just a generic ""Disney Generations"" title page with a single option, ""Play""), and the film starts immediately without the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" opening titles, bumpers, or end credits, as have appeared on some of Disney's other made-for-TV releases. There are optional subtitles, but no other extras."
1,Christmas shouldn't be bootylicious...,"It's easy to hate Christmas songs as they are played-to-death each season. But, ""All I want for Christmas is You"" is one of the worst. It ranks down there with ""Santa Baby"", and its infamy owes as much to its stale genre as it does to Ms. Carey's singing style. I mean, she's great for the dance floor, but Christmas music should not sound bootylicious."
1,Horror Christmas Is Coming To Town!!!,"Oh my gosh..... The thin raspy weak Mariah is singing again! This album is sure a let-down to all mankind... If you thought Christina's Christmas Album was horrible, wait till you hear this one. Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Kylie Minogue; Faye, Claire and Lisa of Steps; Andrea of The Corrs have MUCH richer and fuller voice than hers, so pls, if you think her voice is good, it's time for you to go for some BASIC vocal training to help you filter out artists like Mariah..."
1,"I Only Like ""O Holy Night""","Well, Miss Carey, the only song i like on this album is ""O Holy Night"" Celine Also Did Better. Merry Christmas Mariah."
5,The best Christmas album!,"I am Korean.There are very much popularitys in the South Korea.Speech of this album does not need!Really, it is perfect album.If except only short track number, .However, suitable harmony (dance, ballade, chorus, high note etc.), her soft voice made from this album to the best Christmas album.Specially, O Holy Night talks her song ability.High note and people's applause that spurt in 'Divine' are really great.So, people's purse is opened.Therefore, 'Merry Christmas' is that can not but be the best Christmas album."
5,Mariah Makes it Feel Like Christmas at Any Time of the Year!,"Mariah Carey makes it feel like Christmas no matter what time of the year it is, with her wonderful collection of Christmas songs! Every single song on this album is great, and, to be honest, I can't find anything wrong at all with the album or any of the songs on it! So order this CD right now, and get ready to make it feel like Christmas any time at all!"
4,Mariah Carey's Christmas is the essentail Christmas album!,Anyone that likes holiday and Christmas cheer music should add this essential piece to thier collection. This album is great and stands the test of time. Each year when I pop it in it sounds just as good as when it was first released. No one can carry a high pitched tune like the incomparable Mariah Carey. Add this to your collection today! All I want for Chritsmas and Holy Night are priceless gems.
5,Mariah at her best.,"I can only take Mariah Carey in small doses usually, but this is a magnificent album. Checkout 'O Holy Night'. It's probably up there with one of the greatest versions of this song. I'm not crazy about what seems to be the newst trend of 'Santa Claus is coming to Town', but other than that, it's a truly great album."
1,There's no such thing as Santa..........,"And whilst your listening to this CD, that will be more clear than ever, as you will wonder what you did wrong to deserve such a toturous experience. Mariah's voice seems undeveloped, and the production is non-existent. The songs are contrived and cliche, and the overall quality is poor. Mariah's huge ego stops this album from having any real warmth, and her snobbery shines through on many of the songs, paricularly 'All i want for chistmas', where it is obvious that she is a woman who always gets what she wants. For a supeior, and warmer christmas album, purchase Dolly Parton's 'Home For Christmas'."
2,Bubblegum crap,"This album is horrible. She annoys the crap out of me. I don't have this album, but my cousin does and she put it on and i was dyig cuz it was so bad!! Mariah's songs suck. I don't like this type of music anyway. i like metal/rockOh, 2 stars cause her voice is amazing"
1,"The spirit of taking, as demonstrated by mariah","Mimi seems to love nothing more than raping her fans of their hard earned cash, As she seems adament in re-hashing any stale recording she has made.The truth is, when it comes to making a christmas album, mariah doesn't have the spirit or warmth to pull off any sense of spirit or joy it takes to produce a worthy christmas album."
5,The Best Album of Mariahs Career!,"Before I start I would just like to share my disappointment in many of the below reviews who base their judgement on the album on Mariahs persona or on her record companies policites instead of on the music.This is a great album full of classic Christmas songs and is already in itself a classic. I already owned the original version of the album and loved it. Now I generally dont like to re-buy albums but the DVD on this is so good that it is well worth it.You get Mariahs classic song All I Want For Christmas Is You plus her fantastic renditions of O Holy Night, Silent Night, Joy to the World and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. The album as a whole is very seasonal and will appeal to any generation.As for parents worried about the DVD contents, they need not be. They are very innocent and you will not find one scene of Mariah in a short skirt.Just to conclude I own many Mariahs albums, old and new, but this one is my favorite."
5,Mixing (some) new with the old,"Mariah Carey was at the top of her game when she released this gem in 1994. She put herself on the map with ""Vision of Love"" in 1990 and her star still burned bright four years later.I remember when the video for ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" was released and, appropriately, hearing it played numerous times on the radio as well, and I knew it was an ""instant classic"" (oxymoron?). The song just had a fun feeling to it, something that was really upbeat in keeping with the spirit of Christmas.Mariah also did her takes on traditional Christmas songs (the list of which can be found on this page), and anyone can hear how passionate and heartfelt she was in belting out traditional tunes. That spirit still comes through nearly 15 years later.""Merry Christmas"" is a great holiday music investment. The sound isn't dated now - and I don't think it ever will be. - Donna Di Giacomo"
3,Expedition e-compass,"The watch works well but the compass hand is indistinguishable from the time hands, increasing the chance of error."
5,any more stars?,"Outstanding, deep, real, beautiful stands the test of time. I used to own this on tape and I had lost it. I thank God Almighty I found it now. This is what music is all about. Truth and just so amazing!!! My favorite track is ""all I have in me"" We all need a second chance."
3,Okay compilation,This is yet another one of Aerosmith's DESPARATE compilations to make sure people still know they are together...there are two new tracks but really not worth it YET it is nice to just have it to add to your collection of Aerosmith.
4,Not Bad!!!,"This is my first Aerosmith CD and it's really good! My favorite songs so far are Sweet Emotion, and Dude (Looks Like A Lady) If you love Aerosmith, you'll love DEVIL'S GOT A NEW DISGUISE: THE VERY BEST OF AEROSMITH!!!"
2,Horrible,"This Has To Be The Worst Rip Off Ever It Dosent Even Have Angel, Draw The Line Or Kings And Queens I Definatley Wont Be Wasting My Hard Earned Cash On This Sh**"
3,It could've been done better,"This is a decent compilation of their twenty odd year career. There are two problems with this compilation. Number one, it is basically a one disc version of their ""Oh Yeah!"" two disc compilation with two ""new"" tracks. Number two, there are no tracks from ""Nine Lives"" or ""Honkin' On Bobo"". It should have(in my opinion) been done as a retrospective of their last three studio albums(Nine Lives, Just Push Play, Honkin' On Bobo) with some bonus tracks thrown in. This way, you have ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Gems"" for their classic era and ""Big Ones"" and this one for their ""comeback"" era. Anyway, this is an o.k. compilation. I will only buy it used or wait for a boxed set with the new tracks."
4,Very good for the money but short comings,"Bang for the buck is great got my for under $300. Lots of features, easy setup with mic and sound is good but not great. The hook up of the speakers wires to the receiver is unbelievable diffcult and them keep coming loose. (2) remotes why? Seems like a pieced together home theater package.Last but not least the DVD/CD player plays great but only shuffles one disc at a time! If I would have know that I wouldn't have bought this unit, who wants to shuffle one CD! I would have payed $50 more to have that feature. I hooked up my old player thru the optical input works great.You get what you pay for."
3,Good system for a small room!,"I've had this system for about two months now and am pretty satisfied with it. Setting up the speakers was a pain in the ??? though. Connecting my HDTV,dish network box and DVD player(now a PanasonicBD35)was a little frustrating because I didn't realize you needed a optical digital cable to get any sound eventhough I connected my componets with HDMI cables. If your planning on getting a Blue Ray DVD player you might want to get a higher end receiver, so you can really get the theatre surrsound. Even with these little problems this system puts out good surround sound for a small area. The auto calculation feature works well for those of us who are not ""audiophiles"". So if you'er looking for system that puts out good sound for the price and can be easy to setup if you already know the pit falls then this is the system for you."
1,Just a Compilation of Ideas No Real Value,If you want to read a book by someone who does not have any entrepreneurial experience... This book is for you... if you want to read a summary of all entrepreneurial ideas... This book is again for you... Otherwise it is a big zero... Do not spend your money or time...
1,For those without a clue.,"Very disappointing. The Harvard name and logo can be so deceiving. The first half of the book is spent endorsing the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club, it's members and the author. The actual content is rather lame. If you are absolutely new to the world of business, and you need the definition of CUSTOMER explained to you, maybe you'll learn a little from this book. There are so many good Business Start-Up books available. My advice is to give this one a miss."
3,A little dated...,"Overall this is a good book, provided that you take it for what it is - an opinion piece. There are plenty of facts included in this book (many of which are out-of-date). However, the volume of facts does not support the volume of conclusions drawn by the author. For example:Early on the author states that a failure to create a national database, instead of several independent ones as we have now, had lead to security issues and that the single national database would be better. He does not provide supporting material on WHY it would be better. There are other examples in the book that you can find for yourself.Should you buy it? Maybe consider borrowing it, checking it out from the library, or getting a used one on eBay (mine will be there soon ;-)"
3,Interesting - depending on your expectations.,"I applaud the extensive research and documentation in this work.However, such a broad subject is perhaps only sensationalized in a brief 312 pages. Describing all information gathering from fingerprinting to satellite imagery as an invasion of privacy is either the outcome of wanting to sell books by pandering to the fears of the public or the by product of covering too many individual topics without balanced depth.As a practitioner in using these database sources of information on a daily basis as a Private Investigator, I found most topics lacking in an explanation as to how valuable and important information is, and not to discount it as only an invasion of privacy to be feared.This book is an interesting overview of an important subject, but it's value to the reader will be dependant entirely on what the reader is expecting from it in the first place."
1,No wonder Beyonce is far superior!,"I fell in love with Kelly's newest album ""Here I Am"" and so i decided to pick this up because i heard ""Work"" and fell in love with that song too. i order this and play it, the 1st track is acutally really good! but then all the other songs are mostly ballads :/ and the album version of ""Work"" isnt the version i heard which i found out later is the Freemasons Remix and the Radio played version:/ its a good thing she released Here I Am because this album just isnt good :/"
4,Astronomy and Love,"Good love story, essentially: older rich possibly widowed woman in love with younger poor astronomer. She knows it can't work, but hopes it might and their struggle with the world..A good read for free download.."
5,Tree Trimmer,I like the Fiskars pruning Stik as it is very light and easy to use without the use of the pull down string. I had a bad experience years ago with a pull down string trimmer with wood handle and this style really is an improvement. I also like the way the cutting edge doesn't have to slip over a branch or limb making it very easy and fun to use. It is one of my favorite tools.
4,Fiskars pruning Stik,"I love it"" I have arthritis in my hands and I have no problem using it. I highly recommend it!"
4,Effortless,"Delivery took six weeks. The cutting action is so effortless, I couldn't tell whether a smaller branch had been severed, as there was virtually no resistance. I only wish that A:Fewer parts were plastic B:The pull cord were longer so I could hold the stik overhead and still use it at maximum height, and C:There was a 10 foot extension to get even higher branches."
4,Fiscars pruning stick,A very good telescoping pruner that allows me to trim most of my trees without a ladder or having ropes get caught on limbs .
2,Cutting Head Jaws Stick Closed,"I was really excited about this product based on its reviews. The design is user friendly and the cutting head works well for cutting. The problem comes after the cut. The nylon cord that pulls the head closed gets pinched by the handle. To get the jaws to open, I have to lower the blade and manually feed the cord back through the handle. This gets tedious quickly."
5,An other great Fiskars extended pruner,I have owned a non telescoping Fiskars pruner for over a year and am impresed at the work I can accomplish easily. This telescoping pruner is a great addition to my 6 ft fixed Fiskars.In an hour my oaks looked neater than any on the neighborhood without spending a ton for outside help. I feel more in control of my yard.A great tool for a homeowner.
3,Only Useful If You're a Veteran Episcopalian,"For the truly visually impaired Episcopalian this is a very useful book. The print is very readable. The true problem lies in the fact that it is not paginated like the Book of Common Prayer that is used in the Episcopal Church. If you are a newcomer to the Episcopal Church and not familiar with where things are in the Prayer Book, even with a ""Sunday program"" or ""bulletin"" it is difficult to find the appropriate pages in this large print book. The Episcopal service tends to jump around in the Prayer Book. Without reference to the corresponding pages in this large print book, a novice would be lost. Morehouse Barlow used to publish two large print paperbacks, one with the Eucharists Rites I and II and the other with the Psalter...they were paginated the same as the Book of Common Prayer. Why they stopped publishing in this form is beyond me."
3,five books/prep tools compared,"I found this Microsoft book less useful than the two others I bought: Cockcroft/Eckel/Kauffman (ISBN 157610690X) and Chacon/Chellis/Donald/Desai/Robichaux (ISBN 0782127606). Neither was perfect, but each had its strengths. By reading both I was able to pass the 240 monster-exam with 2-3 weeks' preparation. Transcender was critical in such a rushed exam prep.Next time I might not bother to buy any books, but just use Transcender with its Resource Kit references, sourcing the articles from TechNet's #1 CD, ""Technical Information"", the only CD I (sometimes) take with me on holiday!The books do have their advantages: 1. you can travel without a laptop; and 2. they are a chance to escape the evil clutches of your monitor.By the way, I also bought Chellis/Desai/Donald/Robichaux's ""Exam Notes"" (ISBN 0782127703) but didn't use it - the exam syllabus is available on the Microsoft web site and the remaining content is too superficial to really help.Good luck with the exam."
3,Interesting,"This movie is very strange and kind of hard to follow at times. I am a huge zombie fan, which is why I purchased it. Not a bad addition to a zombie fan's collection."
2,Not Good,"Starts out ok with the killing of the undead, but quickly gets dumb when it strays to this ridiculously un-followable plot. Avoid."
5,"A Great MOVIE, not just a great horror movie.","Everyone keeps commenting that this is one of the best horror movies ever... I wouldn't know, I dislike horror movies. But I LOVED this one. Intelligent, extraordinairly darkly funny, & completely unpredictable.Don't let all of the horror film comments scare you off. If you like good movies, & you appreciate dark humor, you'll like this one."
1,??????????,"After reading all the rave reviews, I was very excited to finally have this movie in my possession. Sadly, I just don't understand the hype. Tongue-in-cheek? Art House? It's hard to catergorize, but I guess that's what it's all about: a movie trying so very hard to be uncatergorized. This DVD is a must for those truly hip, in-the-know, cerebal types; the ones who can read into all the symbolism etc...Personally, dark-humor, tongue-in-cheek zombie movies aren't for me! I don't like to have zombie movies make me think.. I want them to terrify me into a fetal like position!!!"
3,Chamelleon,"This is my least favorite Helloween album by far (although I have not yet gotten their latest). I have been listening to them for 10 years and I have liked their earlier works (Keeper of the seven keys 1 And 2, Walls of Jerricho) much better. If you want to try them, start with those three. If you like this band/music, also try Manowar. While the musical style is slightly different, they still have stories in their songs which I enjoy."
5,Wonderful Course but Better With Behind the Wheel Chinese,"I give 5 stars to Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese) by Pimsleur.Pimsleur's method really works. If you really want results then buy and use this course.If you want even better results, then combine this wonderful course with another approach and method. I have found Language Dynamics Behind the Wheel Mandarinto be the ideal companion course to Instant Conversational Mandarin. The learning technique is also very good and you learn a lot of sentences and vocabulary with the course. I have gotten excellent results using both."
3,I like the Pimsleur method but be wary!,"I already have the Quick and Simple Mandarin Chinese by Pimsleur and really loved it but, even though the description says-'goes beyond the Quick and Simple...'The first 8 lessons (first half) is merely a repackaging of the 8 lessons in the Q + S.So, I cannot comment on the second half because I was so upset about being duped that I returned it!-ck"
3,Too Rigid and No Tracks,I found Pimsleur's Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversation) to be too rigid and presented far too little vocabulary for my taste.I have no complaints about the fact that there is no written material since I do all of my language learning in the car.I do not like the fact that there are no tracks. Switching tracks is essential to in-car language learning unless you like listeneing to the same segment three thousand times over every day.I like the Language Dynamics Behind the Wheel method more. The Chinese course doesn't have a book either but they have more vocabulary and multiple tracks and two native Mandarin speakers.
1,Didn't inspire me in the least,"I bought this book because I'd heard how it took the ""guilt"" out of being behind in scrapbooking and because it makes you look at scrapbooking in a whole new way. It did neither for me. For me, scrapbooking has always been about preserving my memories. It also gives me a creative outlet. I thought her organizational system was interesting, but it would never work for me. I may not scrap in chronological order, but I'd like my layouts to at least flow in some sort of chronological order. I also thought her layouts in the book were horrible and completely uninspiring. For a few great scrapbook idea books, I would go with Jeanette Lynton's books, Cherish, Imagine, and Reflections."
5,Excellent choice....,"if you are just beginning scrapbooking, haven't done it in a while and want to pick it back up, or love scrapbooking and do it all the time! I haven't done it in a while and wanted to pick it back up--but I needed a new way of going about it. Stacy shares her non-chronological method that takes away all the guilt and makes it fun again. This book has so many fun projects and ideas that I can see me completing. Normally I love the books and think the ideas are great but they don't fit what I want to accomplish or can't see myself completing. This one is so different. And because of this book I signed up for an online class at Stacy's online company, Big Picture Scrapbooking. I love it and I'm getting so much done!!"
4,First Rate,"The book ""Sams Teach Yorself e-Travel Today"" was a great way for me to search the web for travel tips. I was able to take what the author has suggested and use it to plan a great vacation. I was a novice about online travel until I read this guide book.

1,Confusing,"I bought this for a Creative Writing seminar on story cycles. I didn't understand how this piece was a story cycle, nor did I connect on any level to anything in the book - which made it a boring read."
2,Is Freddy dead yet?,Just a typical Freddy sequel that is actually quite good. A few good deaths and wise cracks. Although they seemed to finish Freddy off quite quickly that it would seem like they had another sequel planned.
2,No Big Deal Here,"I watched this movie twice trying to find something to recommend it to hardcore Freddy Krueger fans, but I kept finding myself remembering New Nightmare, which was an excellent blend of terror, gore, and a clever plot by Wes Craven. That was a good movie; this is a mess, with good special effects (not at the end, though) leading the way in the lack of storyline, likable and original characters, and Freddy's patented mayhem and quotes. Even Krueger dying is no big deal. See the original if you want to be scared...see this one if you want to sigh repeatedly wishing it was better than most 80's slashers out there."
2,One of the worst sequels of all time,"This movie had great potential and could have been a great sequel. Unfortunately no one tried to follow through on it. The acting is horrible and the freddy deaths are like something out of a looney toons cartoon. Freddy delivers way too many one liners and they aren't even clever or funny. The idea of Freddy being able to travel to other Elm Streets and kill new victims was a great idea, but unfortunately the idea turns into $#!% on screen. The best part, seriously, is the end. Not the movie part but the credits. This is due to the fact that horrible movie is over and you get to see the deaths from other NOES movies. Catch it late at night on tv if you still desire to see it, otherwise avoid at all costs"
1,What happened!,What happened. I loved the original Nightmare on Elm Street but this. This is like Tales from the Crypt meets in the kitchen with Bob. Totally wierd. I did like the part about learning about Freedi's history but the rest was pretty lame. Whatever happened to the evil dark Freddi from the first movie. I'm pretty amune to scary movies so don't take my judgement but I don't think that this movie would scare a five year old. Do not get this movie if your looking for thrills get it if your looking for information on Freddi's background.
3,Can't give it too much credit,"I'll keep my review short for you all. Freddy's Dead...well, not really. The Freddy character does appear in at least two films after this. I also found the little part about how he told the demons he wanted imortality a little dumb. The way Freddy is killed, although I don't remember the specifics, is not rewarding along with the silly scene where he kills somebody within a video game. This is the second film in the series that I would give as a reason to not purchase the Nightmare On Elm Street Collection and just stick with the 1st, 3rd, New Nightmare, and Freddy Vs. Jason movies."
5,Justification for all the things we really want to do!,"Ms. Holland has provided me with extensive support for all of those guilty pleasures I too often deny myself. She tells me why I should enjoy going to work, playing tourist while on vacation, hanging around the house doing nothing, eating and drinking - an all around reckless life. I leave a copy of this book in my guest room and have awaken to chuckles and guffaws, and visitors with a renewed sense of indulgence. If you ever feel guilty, buy and read this book!"
5,Lomborg and the environment,An articulate and well written expose on the 'real state if the world'. Lomborg provides a compelling and accessable study into the environment and the many statements that are made about it on a day-to-day basis. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a scientific and realistic interpretation of what is actually happening out there.
5,A serious important book,"Lomborg has written a well researched, carefully documented, readable book that exposes the shoddy research of so many of the establishment enviornmentalists. And they don't like it. Read the book, then read the criticism and his responses on Lomborg's web site and on The Scinentific American's web site (the S.A. wouldn't let Lomborg post their criticism of him on his web site). I found the SCIENTIST'S criticism based mostly on ""because I say so"" but make up your own mind.The crux is global warming. Lomborg finds The Kyoto Accord very expensive to impliment. There isn't much argument here. He also finds it almost worthless as a cure for global warming. This is also consistent with what the serious envioronmental data shows, but this isn't what the media is telling us."
1,Measuring the difference between science and statistics,"Bjorn Lomborg has an education in statistics and is the head of the environmental agency in Denmark as we speak. He was elected to fill that position as the far right prime minister Anders Fogh Andersen was elected. He represents a very conservative philosophy concerning the future of the environment and one should be very cautious when reading that he is representing the environment at all. The book is a classic example of how and why people believe what they read. If it makes people feel better to believe that they can drive as many cars that suit their needs and not concern themselves with the water pollution that kills so many precious lives, then who can argue that. Their decision was made far before reading this book."
1,Selective science,"Earlier this year, Lomborg was discredited by his academic peers for his selective and incomplete science. He is a statistician, not a scientist, and certainly not an environmental scientist. Read this book only as an example of how clever statistical methods can be used to create a profitable product for a niche market."
4,Lomborg must have hit a sensitive spot,"For all the reviewers who only rely on Scientific American's negative 'review' for your negative perceptions of this book, you must know that SA refused to allow Lomborg a full rebuttal either in the magazine or on his own website. They threatened him with legal action for publishing their criticism so he could respond point by point. Not very scientific, hm? The Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty have shown their lack of objectivity also. Read Lomborg's rebuttal at:http://www.greenspirit.com/lomborg/I look at all this polemic and just shrug. What are the greenies hiding? I place environmentalism high on my list of important issues, but hate being lied to so the green lobby can 'capture [my] imagination'. Most of us aren't so dumb..."
1,Scientific Dishonesty at Its Most Damaging,"Lomborg is not an expert . . . he is not even a scientist. His work is filled with errors and displays a general ignorance on ecological theories and processes. Readers would be better advised to turn to peer-reviewed journals (i.e., Nature or Science) for their information, or an Environmental Science textbook for an overview.One thing of note - it is important to be critical of scientific information. Every good scientist is. But there is a difference between critical thinking and lack of understanding. Lomborg does not provide a critical review of scientific literature.Have we made great strides in improving the state of the world? Of course. Without a doubt. But we have not won that war yet - we still have many more improvements to make.--ER Lawrence, Ecologist"
1,He's been found out,"Bjorn Lomborg is an idiot, who's been thoroughly debunked on both sides of the Atlantic.The only benefit of his book for the environment is a compost."
4,Balance?,"I was quite surprised, initially, at the very strong negative responses by a number of early reviewers. It reminds me of my long years in Audubon and the Sierra Club - if you don't toe the party line and support their grab for more power(power = land), then you don't belong, and I left.This book is one of the few excellent examples of taking difficult to understand (as fed to us by the media) information and making it understandable to anyone at all with a modicum of intelligence. The points are well presented, the conclusions are fairly easy to draw..Still, look for underlying agendas, in even the seemingly most obvious books. He has one, but it's quite benign.In a nutshell, any book must be worth reading if it engenders the kind of mouth-foaming, hysterical reactions it has generated, even with this highly intelligent subset of readers.Well worth the cost."
1,Soft targets and biased selection,"This book pays little attention to the peer reviewed scientific literature on environmental problems. That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems. In addition to picking ""soft targets"" of writings by advocates, the book ignores inflated claims by industry about the economic losses that will accompany environmental regulation. This demonstrates its lack of balance."
1,Lomborg exposed as a fraud,"For those of you who don't read ""Newsweek,"" a recent article discussed the work of critic Howard Friel in tracking down all of Lomborg's numerous references... only to find that they did not say what Lomborg claimed they did. In fact, many of his cited sources actually said the OPPOSITE of what Lomborg suggested in this book.[...]For those interested in detailed proof of Lomborg's deliberate fraud, watch for Yale U. Press's ""The Lomborg Deception"" coming out in March 2010.For those looking for an intelligent and HONEST anlysis of environmental issues... look elsewhere."
5,"Suggested Reading for all those who ask ""do you support clean water"", etc","I am finding I am not alone in my cynicism of the blind buy-in of ""the sky is falling"" mentality towards the environment and the now coined ""green movement"". The author presents a great deal of data to support his thesis but it is well written."
5,A book misunderstood by non-scholars (and a lot of them)...,"Lomborg was brave enough to say "" The King is naked""!"
2,Kinda flimsy,Scales is kinda flimsy and not real accurate - hard to accurately set the ounces. when measure 5 to 10 oz is ok but if you try to measure one or two ounces it doesn't seem to be so well. I would not recommend it
1,In God we trust removed?,"Did not have in god we trust on it. I heard about them doing that to new coins. Hahahaha, though i am sure no one but me prolly cares about that. So just ignore me. :P"
3,For beginners but still misses out on small things,As all dummies it is on a low level which is great for beginners like me who only have minor experience from Visual Basic and VBA. Although it is to MICROSOFT focused. I had to look long and hard elsewhere to come around the fact that I don't have Frontpage/interdev extensions on my server.
3,Good Music,"Barry Manilow has gooooood music, but the beat of many of his tunes is similar. I bought this album to get Copacabana."
1,King of Kitsch,"It is unfathomable that here, in the early days of the 21st century, there are still people who not only listen to the King of Kitsch, but will own up to it. There is a reason why Barry Manilow has spent the better part of a quarter of a century being the punchline of jokes and twenty of those reason can be found here. Sappy songs galore, almost all having the same ""beautiful music"" structure of slow tempo throughout each verse and chorus, before ending in a bombastic crescendo. Sadly these songs can still be heard in elevators and dentist offices across America. Even sadder is that people will pay to hear them again at home."
5,The Title is Right,"This is truly the ultimate collection of Barry Manilow songs. It has all of his very best songs and makes a great companion for long drives and short hops. It's impossible not to sing along with Mandy, It's a Miracle, Looks Like We Made It and his other greatest hits. And for those who like Manilow and who also like close harmony, maybe I'll see you when his show, The Comedian Harmonists, opens on Broadway!"
1,"You CAN'T Be Serious, People!","Something is very, very wrong with this disc. I thought that products with saccharine were supposed to have warning labels."
1,Extremely poor audio quality,"Wow, was I disappointed with this purchase! The audio quality of this CD is horrendous. It's hard to imagine that with today's technology, the record label couldn't produce a better product. It's quite obvious that they're simply trying to suck more dollars out of the unsuspecting public.I've always been a huge Barry Manilow fan -- growing up with his heartful, albeit sappy, ballads. Too bad this particular CD is such poor quality.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!P.S. To the reviewer who slammed BM: If you don't like his music to begin with, why in the world did you buy his CD? And, if you didn't buy it, don't waste our time writing reviews!"
1,Zero Stars!,"This book purchase was a HUGE mistake! It is a 2-in-1 book, and the two stories are from 1973 and 1974. They are Neanderthal romances at best - the male leads are domineering, aggressive, inconsiderate, and completely unheroic. These are not romance stories by any stretch of the imagination, and the book itself is a bit like a wolf in sheep's clothing. The cover indicates that you might be in for a nice Christmas tale or two, but the cover was just a sales feature. The stories have nothing at all to do with Christmas and, in fact, do not even take place at Christmas-time. I think it was a horrible way to introduce readers to this author, especially if you have never read her stuff before (which I hadn't). Perhaps this author has improved her storytelling since the 70s, but based on this nonsense I wouldn't waste my time with her again. The stories were poorly written."
3,Red Marine,"It's hard to know how well a product like this works in a short time span and you are taking other types of vitamins as well.Algae is good for you, I'm not convinced this red marine algae is anything better."
4,Improvement,"Shadow of the Future is a vast improvement over Til's first album. The songs are stronger, and the feel is kind of murky and cool. I bought the album at a live show of Til's thinking the songs were great. However, I must admit that it took me a few times listening to it before I got into it, but now I think it's great, a much needed break from all the overproduced albums that come these days.The music on Shadow is raw and feels peiced together with an energy and youth. And, even though the meter wavers here and there on a number or two it all adds to this rough real quality, almost like a blues record."
2,Very disappointed,The video was scratchy and wouldnt realy play so after the expenseand the expectation I have been unable to watch it.Very disappointed.
2,freddie mercury tribute,i guess there must be a re issue they must put all the metallica songs thank you
5,Greatest Tribute ever!,"Of course Queen was one of the most electrifying bands ever! This Concert is no expection to the great music that will always be kept alive in Freddies memory. Seeing Elton John and Axl Rose doing bohemium rhaspody sent chills down my spine, when axl comes out look at the crowd, you cant help but want to get up and rock on! This si the best concert ever and please Release this on DVD,... LONG LIVE FREDDIE MERCURY!"
5,Please Re-Release this video!,"This was truly a gem of a concert. If anyone out there who reads this has any clout with the video producers, PLEASE re-release it. I would pay $50 for it!"
1,Should have been Complete,"Well, I bought it and returned it when I found out that they had edited the first half of the concert. I had the original taped from MTV back in 92 and lost it but then I purchased the VHS which to my disappointment had Bob Geldof & Spinal Tap removed among other things. Which is still not as bad as this DVD - Somebody please release the whole thing!! Thank You"
3,Disappointed...,"I just got this DVD, an impulse buy. I was very disappointed to find out that it didn't include the part of the tribute show with the individual bands performing, particularly Extreme's great medley of Queen songs. I can't believe they only included half of the show, despite the fact that this is a 2 DVD set. Oh, well, next time I'll read the fine print."
3,Not all that was on VHS......,I was hoping to replace my old worn out VHS but more than half the show is not there.....Can only hope they put it out on Blu-Ray.....COMPLETE....And YES...I'll buy it a THIRD time.
3,"Where's Metallica, Def Leppard, Guns and Extreme?????","Who in heaven, being a video editor could possibly think on taking these four acts off this concert? I remember when I first saw them, they were one of the reasons that put me into rock n' roll. The rest of the performances are quite good, but you really need Metallica, Guns, Def an Extreme to really enjoy this concert. If it was for rights reasons, Queen are multi-millionaires! and we, their fans, buy ANYTHING they put out (just take a look at all the people giving five stars to Hot Space). I demand putting out a new version of this concert in its entirety!"
4,Farmer Jones,"Was as expected, slightly worn. Double the size. Expected the book to be the size of the Little Golden Books, much bigger."
1,disappointed,I have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing. Child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her. I will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck.
4,A good buy.,"My 6 month old loves this mat. He lies on his back and bats at the toy bar, and kicks the tree with his feet. He also loves the music.My only real complaint is how small the mat is - he is a big boy and doesn't really have room to roll over without running into the side bars."
4,My baby liked it!,"We bought this when my baby girl needed some tummy time. She hated tummy time, but loved to lay on her back and stare at the toys. I think this gym was helpful when she was learning to reach and grab at toys, too. She even loved to sit in her Bumbo and play with the toys from that angle. Overall, we got a lot of play time hours out of this gym, and I even made up words to the song the little white tiger plays."
4,"Good movie, not scary","Great movie it keeps you going. The only thing was it wasn't scary, (i don't get scared very easly and i'm only 11) thats why I only give it 4 stars, but otherwise It was great. One other thing it's eather I missed something, or when Nancy friend the one who died first her boyfriend was scratching on the window pretending to be Freddy, he didn't know about him yet? huh!"
4,WHO NEEDS ''FRIDAY THE 13TH''? WHEN YA GOT THIS,"THIS 1984 HORROR CLASSIC IS ABOUT FREDDY KRUEGER [ROBERT ENGLUND], A CHILD MURDERER WHO WAS KILLED BY A GROUP OF PARENTS OUT OF REVENGE. FREDDY COMES BACK FROM THE DEAD IN DREAMS IN WHICH HE CAN KILL PEOPLE FOR REAL, AND IT'S UP TO ONE GIRL [HEATHER LAGENKAMP] TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE KILLS ALL THE TEENAGERS OF ELM STREET. THIS IS TRULY A CLASSIC. THERE'S FANTASTIC MURDER SCENES, A LOGICAL PLOT, AND THERE'S EVEN SOME HUMOR. THIS MOVIE IS IN A CLASS OF IT'S OWN. THIS MOVIE INSPIRED 7 SEQUELS [THE 7TH ONE IS FREDDY VS. JASON, WHICH IS SLATED TO HIT THEATRES SOMETIME THIS YEAR] AND A SHORT-LIVED TV SHOW NAMED FREDDY'S NIGHTMARES."
4,The behind the scenes info is well worth the price,"I won't go too in depth into the story. If you don't know who Freddy Krueger is then you've been out of the pop cultural loop for well over two decades. What I will say is this DVD gives a great deal of info behind one of the classic slashers of the 1980s. Finally seeing the two alternate endings as well as listening to Wes Craven's commentary on his best movie helped to deepen the respect I have for this masterpiece, and yes, this is an excellent film."
2,Pretty bad.,"I think this movie is supposed to be very scary but I can't say that it scared me at all. In fact the creepiest part was that morbid song the kids sing at the beginning: ""One, Two, Freddy's coming for you"" etc. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it was a very good, different idea. The problem is that a horror movie is supposed to be just that: horrifying. I fell asleep during the movie, so obviously Freddy getting into my dreams was not a big issue. Maybe its a classic and I don't know what I am talking about, but I didn't like this movie much."
1,a terrible movie!,"The first time i saw this movie was when i was 5-years old and it did not scare me at all...i just recently saw it again and i saw all of the stupid parts in it...it was a very cheesy movie,had alot of corny special effects in it. I liked Halloween better!!"
1,one of the dumbest,"this is, as any typical wes craven movie, dumb silly and not at all effective. The plot is ludicrous and freddy cruger looks like a refugee from a costume party. I saw this once and almost fell asleep watching this absurd, silly and just plain dumb horror of a movie. It baffles me how people could consider this a great film. it is a great film to go to sleep to. The effects are poor and unconvincing, and the acting is awful, there is no suspense and Freedy Kruger could make me laugh if this weren't such a dopey film. Avoid this as one should all wes craven films including scream."
4,NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET!!!!!!!!,"This is the best Freddy movie of all. The rest flailed except one! Wes Craven's New Nightmare was good too. But those were the only ones worth anything. Heather Langenkamp was great in this movie and so was Johnny Depp. This movie helped Johnny's carrer. Its a great movie, and somewhat scary. If you're a diehard horror fan and love true horror then this is a must have! Buy it now if you can find it. If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and rent it!"
4,"One, two; Freddy's coming for you","Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the best horror movies to date. After watching everything from Dracula to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I found Nightmare on Elm Street one scary and fun roller-coaster ride of a movie. It is a definite must see for any horror movie fan!"
2,When does it get scary?,"I bought this movie on the sole premise of watching Johnny Depp in his first starring role. I saw this film when it came out and I could never figure out why it was scary. While rewatching it I think that I may just be associating Robert Englund too much as Willy from V and not enough as evil Freddy. 20 years later not much has changed, I still was not scared and Johnny Depp still looks good."
3,"""Imaginative but doesn't quite cut it""","Ok back in 1984 this was supposidly brilliant but seen now it is so dated and corny and has not at all aged well. Maybe this has alot to do with the producers for making a joke out of razor fingered Freddy Krueger in later sequels who knows? Unfortunately the acting is atrocious John Saxon looks so much out of place and is wasted in yet another supporting role even though he gets star billing. Heather Langenkamp is just awful and the terribly wasted Robert Englund is given so little to do. In my opinion Nightmare 2 was so much much better (sorry Craven fans) and Freddy was much more frightening. No doubt the film was influential, but in no way is it a horror classic and cannot be compared to genuine classics that have stood the test of time for over 60 years such as ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" and others. Check out Scream for a much better and glossier slasher flick."
4,Wes Craven's terrifying tale,"Kevin Williamson may have Halloween as his favorite movie, but Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street stands out as my favorite from that time period. Everyone has heard of Freddy by now, but back when this first came out, it was new and original. Heather Langenkamp plays the lead character Nancy, who suffers through seeing her friends picked off one by one by the diabolical Freddy. She has no clue what to do or how to stop him until she realizes how when she was able to take a souvenir from the dream, Freddy's hat, then Nancy makes a plan to catch him and destroy him. Wes Craven directs this movie wonderfully and honestly. Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund give the best performances in the movie. GRADE: B+"
3,The one!The only!The original!,"Surreal as it is scary,this one will keep you on the edge.Make no mistake the first is always the best.Ignore the campy sequels(well Wes Craven's New Nightmare was good but more of a psychological thriller with fantasy elements than anything). The shocker ending is a little strange but totally unexpected,much like Jason popping up out of Crystal Lake at the end of the orignal F-13th(not so good,but Besty Palmer shines as the murderously vindictive Mrs.Voorhees!).This movie ushered in a new era of scary movies.Worth multiple rentals."
4,One of the SCARIEST!!!!!!!!,"I really liked this one. It was really scary. The part where Nancy[Heather Langenkamp],Which I might add is one of my favorite actresses,goes into the boiler room to find freddy at the end was the scariest.I did not like the ending at all."
4,Good movie,Notice I didn't say Great the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars and calling it great is the fact that the ending was lame. Other than that this movie is one of the best of its genre and one of the best movies out there. But I can't look past the ending which left me with a desire to write a better ending. I didn't because as you can see my writing skills are lacking in depth and creativity. Great movies should have great endings...great movies with lame endings get to be called good. That said I would recommend this movie and if it weren't for the ending I would say get it today but because of the ending I say rent then buy if you like. And hey you can get it real cheap on Amazon.com. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it.
4,Ya you think i am weird but listen to why i am!,Ya you think i dont know how to rate a movie but i do....! In my opinion i think this is not the best out of the series. I did bye all of them and saw that this one did have some good killing scenes but not like the 3rd on up^ In the other ones comedy is presented in the scenses and him he is just a lot more fun! Now i did not say i did not like this one i just said more effort was put into the sequals! My family always says that when the saw all the series when they were little this was their fav. Just not that scary ither!
4,Fast service...,"Though perhaps not the very best product. I have found a few loose seams, but overall it is a nice quality. It is large and has plenty of nice pouches."
5,Read This Book If You Want To Know What Progressives Want,"There is something special about this book: it was written based on the vision Progressives have for the world. Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian was a Progressive. Julian shared his belief on eugenics, population control, sterilization, and propaganda with Aldous. Aldous decided it sounded like an interesting novel. Fiction based on fact.If you follow what is happening in the U.S. and across the globe, you will see the reflection of truth in this book. The attacks on religion, history, individuality, and truth are all present in 2011."
4,Brave New World- A Glance at a Terrible Future,"Brave New World excellently depicts a future that very well may happen, a terrible future that shows mindless masses and an immpossible-to-break caste system. People are grown in ""Hatcheries"" like plants, and are conditioned for death and show no remorse at a fellow mans passing away because there is no individual in this society. ""The World Controllers"" believe this to be pure happiness and think that it's citizens would never leave but they fail to see the difference between pleasure and happiness and the striving of the human mind to be individualic."
4,Review from Mercy High School Students,"Huxley's Brave New World is a novel written in the thirties about genetic engineering used to create a utopian society, and shows the dangers of ""playing god."" This book is very prophetic because our society is facing many of these circumstances now in the 21st century that Huxley presented in his writing almost 70 years ago. It stands as a warning for our society as we seem to be striving for the society Huxley created even though that society was obviously not as perfect as its rulers felt it to be. Destroying hunger, disease, and old age may seem like a wonderful idea but with such things can come a great struggle for power and further control over individuals' lives. The novel really makes you think especially about our current society and how close we may be to achieving Huxley's ""Utopia."""
5,a MUST for everyone,"I think this is one of my favorite books. To the person who ""had to read it for a class"" and thought it was ""terrible"" yet said ""everybody has their own view on it"" -- you just answered your own problem. You said it ""was very different from anything I had read before"" -- isn't that the point? Your class got you to read something different.Sorry, I'm lecturing. This book is wonderful -- a great comment on ""civilized"" culture and an ordered society. Everybody who thinks things are fine should read this book."
2,Oh The Horror!,"My Opinion: I didn't find any characters that I was able to like. One is given a choice between insanity and lunacy as Huxley says in his forward. I picked neither. The book was dark and depressing. This might have been the point, but I don't have to like it. I would have liked it more had there been a main character that was more of a hero or an individual in this society of clones. If it would have been more about Helmholtz's struggles or if John would have been less crazy, I think it would have been better for me. Instead we are faced with the horror of drug addicted society members and the insanity of a savage that has a warped set of morals."
1,boring,"this has got to be the most boring book i have ever read, & maybe that is because i am younger & it was written in 1932 but it was horrible i didn't understand a dang word.. i am very dissapointed too i was really looking forward to this book .."
4,Interesting look at our future,"In the days of cloning, this book seems all the more real and intriguing. Huxley's Alpha, Beta and Gamma groups of people that have been cloned and taught to do certain things, strikes a very familiar chord with recent events and debates going on now on the ethic's of cloning. What if Hitler had these technologies during WWII so he was able to not only exterminate the Jews but to clone more people with the dominant traits he thought so superior? We (as a society) have already been confronted with Orwell's Big Brotherly surveillance of society as can be seen in the movie ""Enemy of the State."" What will happen when and if the cloning technologies of ""Brave New World"" also enter our society? A must read for anyone in today's world!!"
3,Interesting,"The main thrust of this novel is a description of a future where social stability is the primary concern of the ""World State."" People are altered prior to birth to fit into castes of different ability and social strata. Pain and suffering are much reduced by eliminating the emotion involved in personal interactions, filling leisure time so that people don't have time to think, and by using the drug soma. The characters and plot are incidental to the description of the World State.Although this novel is interesting, and possibly ahead of its time, the passage of time has seen this type of future and its variations depicted many times in mostly bad science fiction books, movies, and television shows. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to approach this book with a fresh eye."
4,A Brave New World,"Brave New World takes the reader into a world were science and the economy takes over everyone's life. What would life be if everything was decided for you before you were born? What if your emotions didn't matter? Would life change if there was no families, mothers, and fathers?One would think that life would be easier if one was always happy but at the risk of not knowing the truth. John, a ""savage,"" comes to the ""brave new world"" World State. At first he thinks it is amazing but when he realizes that everything goes against his values on marriage, family, and love; he tries to revolt.Brave New World was an excellent book. It makes you think about the world today and is it really possible for the world to change like that. Would life really be easy if the only things to worry about were being happy, and working because you were conditioned to love your job? Would you be willing to give up art, science, emotions, and everything that makes up humanity in order to be happy?Vanessa B"
3,"Scary vision of a very ""social"" future...","Pretty grim vision of a future where everybody is happy and sedated and zombie-like. Sure, they're happy, but it's because they're being kept that way by the powers that be. Not only that, but being alone is forbidden, and everything is ""social"" and must be ""shared""... sound familiar??? I did have to skim through some incredibly slow and dry parts, hence the three stars. Can't say it was a waste of time, but I had to force myself to finish it."
2,"Some truths about society,most do hit predicting the future.",This book can be related to the society in whole. Most books can do this. Some things bother me about the book. I was mostly confused what his point was while I was reading the book.I really did not care for it. NBC
3,Good book in the right frame of mind,"This is a tough read if your head's not in the right place, but a good book. I'll read it again someday."
3,message too obvious,"Although not set in our time context, I find the message in this story keeps slapping you in the face until you get tired of it. It is well written, but a little subtelty would allow a more complex story line where you didn't have to hand the reader a moral-on-a-platter."
2,Hmm...,"I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it. It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs..."
5,Timeless,"Huxley's dystopia novel of a world controled by ""placating"" it's public is one of the most fascinating an eerie portraits of world humanity put together.Written in the early 30's this book is still incredibly relevant and holds the test of time.Two main characters in Huxley's novel produce the most perfect irony of the flawed state. One tries to shun those trying to control him, the other is stuck in a world he hates but can't force himself to leave cause of his complacency. It is the craft of conformity that Huxley is getting at, and the obsession that we as people have with comfort and control that is brilliantly portrayed.Awesome book."
4,Is this the Affordable Health Care Act?,"I enjoyed it. Required reading for those who have read Atlas Shrugged. Following it up with Brave New World Revisited is a good idea. Unfortunately, I think most of Despicable Me's minions won't understand the warning."
5,Exploration Of Possibility Through A Masterpiece,A masterpiece that shows the possibilities of the future. This book tells the story of the future that has no sense of ethics; only systematic operations. Aldous Huxley delivers this story well with great twists.
4,A very twisted tale.,"This is a book that does a great job at showing the narrow mindedness of society. We fall into our norms and grooves and are shocked by anything that fales to fit into these refences. This book is about a dystopian society that has test tube babies, drug abuse and rocket cars. It shows the contrast of two cultures through a lost son who is found and his troubles adjusting to his new life. Truely bizzarre. A good read"
2,Doesn't fulfil even the lowest requirements for fiction,"I don't understand why Mr. Huxley is so famous. Okay, he has a very strong message, but then, his writing skills are non-existent. This book completely lacks fantasy and originality. As a result, the possible appeal of Mr. Huxley's ideas is overweighed in a hundredfold by the despise his ""prose"" (sorry for using this word here!) makes you feel. How is one supposed to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful landscape by a scribble of a three-year-old? Instead of this ""novel"", Mr. Huxley should have written a short newspaper article titled ""Things I Don't Like"".If Mr. Huxley is a writer, anybody who talks is a linguist. Reading this book leaves one perplexed - how could the author voluntarily expose himself to such ridicule?"
2,Brave New World? 1984? Ehh...,"From what i saw of the other reviews this novel is heavily compared to 1984... well i must say i absolutely HATED 1984 so for those people who hated 1984 also, this review of this book is for you! Brave New World is a lot like 1984 both are about controlled societies and both have characters that insist on going against the rules. 1984 was a horrible book, but Brave New World wasn't soo bad. It was an intersting read. The first 8 chapters kind of stink, but once you get past them it's not too bad .. yea i know that's a lot to get past!.. the book isn't tooooo bad but it's still far from great! I know there is some great message that your supposed to get out of this book, but i didn't really get it! It was an ok book .. better than 1984 but still don't read it if you don't absolutely have to like i did!"
1,"Unfortunately, the rewies below ar enot the truth...","This boos is so weak, the narrative is so boring, thecharacters are so ridiculous and awkward, that I can't understand whatpeople saw in it. There's no climax, the plot is old cliche in the ""science-fiction"" (even being written in 1926) and people get saying that the book is ""prophetic"", ""visionnaire"".. Come on! IT is just boring. The end is laughable, the character who theoretically fights the organized civilization is also a ""robot"", because he only says what he read in Shakespeare. Blá!"
2,Futuristically boring,"After people have told me to read this novel several times, I decided to pick it up at the library. The first few pages intrigued me and as the novel progressed I became bored. I absolutely began to become disappointed in the praise that others have offered for it. I quit reading the book 3/4ths of the way through, returning it to the library shelves where it belongs as eye candy for the people who want to say they read it when they haven't. I read it, hated it, returned it. Good use of language but redundant in its explanations.Sorry to all you Huxley fans but I wasn't impressed."
4,My Kind of Totalitarian State!,"This novel centers around outsiders: sane men in insane societies where art, beauty, and all the profound things in life are replaced with the sensual pleasures. Wacky hijinx ensue. Huxley envisioned this as the ultimate totalitarian state: one where everyone is happy and content with their stations in life, but no one is as free as they think. People are born into the system, live their lives in it, and die in it without ever realizing it exists. To Huxley, this was the way the world was inevitably heading. Both satire and prophecy, some of his predictions have played out as inevitable concequences of where the world was heading when he wrote this. Obviously, others have not. I recommend you read and then decide for yourself how much creedence his ideas deserve."
4,A future bypassed,"This work was great for the period it was written and should be seen and appreciated as that- it made it's impact and helped steer our society away from such a repressed future - we've learned to be more open, casual and physical play has become more validated for men and women- If you want to stimulate your brain towards a likely future (or perhaps one we will just miss by a hairline) from our present standings, I'd read Utopian Reality- it is our times version of Brave New World or 1984 but with a new warning of what we have to steer away from-"
1,mising pages,This book is excellent and i highly recommend that everyone read this classic but this version is missing pages. Buy a different version!!
3,A Brave New World- hopefully not too soon,"Well, I got into this book through an Advanced Placement English class in high school. I read George Orwell's 1984, and I absolutely loved it. So for our final project, I thought I'd read BNW. To tell you the truth, it was disappointing. It was not nearly as long as 1984(I'm a good long book lover), and I didn't think it was quite as well....shall we say.....mapped out. Certainly, a lot of thought went into it, but it is just simply too short. However, it's a good book with some good points, and I would recommend it to anyone. But if you want to read something even better, check out 1984. It will really set your wheels turning, if you like to stay up late at night and just think."
4,not bad,"I just finished reading Brave New World for my English class and I must say the premise itself was intriguing. A society were the words mother and father are viewed a smut, and drugs are taken as an excuse to avoid feelings drew me in. But what I found really didn't interest me. The book felt a little too rushed and needed to be drawn out more. The last few pages were good, but they didn't conclude the book enough for me. The conversation between Mustapha Mond and John was wonderfully insightful, explaining the reasons behind the brave new world, but the relationship ended there. Overall a great idea in a decent book."
2,1984 was much more enjoyable...,"A decent book, but compared to 1984, this book was not that good. Orwell's 1984 was much more enjoyable to read whereas, at times, I felt lost with Brave New World. The line between protagonist and antagonist seemed blurred throughout this book until the end. Perhaps I should read it again to better understand the plot, but overall, I thought 1984 was a better read."
5,A prophetic classic!,"This book is nothing short of pure genius. Considering when it was written, I wonder if Huxley had a time machine to look into the future! A true visionary, and a truly great book!"
4,A scarry look into the future,"I thought Brave New World was a very well written book. Huxely gives us a view of the world in the distant future, this world is corrupt and without values. I think that Huxely makes a good point about society and technology. We see a world where technology has made people emotionles and unable to think for themselves. This is a very relevant topic. Although the book was written in the 1930's is is acurate to the trouble we as a society face in this day and age. We are often hurt by the technological and scientific advances that are, simultaneoulsy making us happier and healthier."
2,A poor cousin to richer dystopias,"It might be easy to spot what aspects of our society Huxley is satirising, in his heavy-handed way, and take THEM seriously; but it's impossible to take Huxley's society seriously. He undercuts his own earnest world-building in order to get a cheap laugh. Worse, he leaves out crucial details which might give us some clue as to what's going on. That we aren't told whether or not Huxley's Brave New People are really happy, is fair enough. That we aren't even told enough to be able to deduce whether or not they are happy is inexcusable: it undercuts any possible moral Huxley may be trying to impart, and believe me, he's certainly trying to impart some moral or other. (He scarcely stops trying long enough to tell a story.) George Orwell was another left-wing British writer inspired by Yvgeny Zamyatin's ""We"", and his vision is vastly better - as is ""We"" itself."
4,Kindle Formatting - Mediocre,"This review isn't a book review (though I thoroughly enjoyed the book), but rather a comment about the Kindle's formatting:The formatting leaves a little to be desired: not always clear breaks, some typos, and a few random euro-language letter swaps for English letters; but overall very readable. You wont be distracted by any glaring errors. I recommend the download."
3,Disturbing,"This was a disturbing book written in the post WW2 era. This book is a projection of the future if communism comes into world wide power. This book because its on this kind of subject also has some contreversial content, it deals widley with the subjects of sex, drugs, entertainment, and the concievment of children. I thought this book was good but it was kind of diturbing the emphasis of sex and ""soma"" which is the perfect drug in the book."
1,"Heavy, Ponderous, Boring Book",I have been a voracious reader for 54 years...since I was 3 years old and I think that this is one of the WORST books that I have ever read. I only read it because it was required reading by my daughter in high school and I had never read it. I still can't figure out why the school system would want teenagers to read that indiscriminate sex and taking drugs is the preferred state of existence. I certainly don't think that they would understand that subliminal message about not rebelling against authority or you will die.Take it off the list. It will make teenagers quit reading.
2,Well Written but not for me,"I met a friend at the library every month and we read the same book together like a small book club, so when we decided to read Brave New World I was excited because I always wanted to read this Unfortunately I was disappointed with it and I didn't enjoy this at all, and had I not made a commitment to reading the book I most likely would have not finished it.I did feel that the it was well written and I'm in awe of how much of what the author wrote in the early 1930s as fiction has become fact in the present. What I didn't like about the book was the use of drugs and how drug use was considered normal and how children was encouraged to play sexual games. My only complaint with the writing of this book is with the character of Bernard. I thought that he would be the character to rebel against the system but he seemed to sell out at the end.I guess science fiction isn't my genre and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who felt the same."
5,A 65 years old book that still is in time!,"In the world, the brave new world, where Bernard Marx lives, people are produced in test-tubes in a laboratory. Sex and soma, the drug that doesn't give you any bieffects, is the main things in life. Everyone belongs to everyone, marrige isn't to talk about, just have sex with anyone you want to, all people on Earth are happy. Is this really the way this planet will end? Even considering the fact that everyone is happy, or rather believe thay are happy, this book is scary. Today even more scary when these scientists have cloned the sheep and things like the ones in Brave new world aren't as unbelievable as they should"
1,Pick something to do already,"The guy had one song -- but what a song. ""Wouldn't it Be Good"" -- but the guy could never stick to anything.1974 he tries to replace Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple.1975/1976 he plays left wing for the Sherbrooke Canadiens but as a pacifist refuses to fight on the ice.1977 he starts a restaurant with some local high school friends which collapses into bankruptcy in 1978.1979 he jumps on to the disco bandwagon writing songs for Evelyn Champagne King just as her career nosedives.Distraught he spends 1980-1982 in the Himalayas finding his inner self.1983 he writes the classic ""Wouldn't it Be Good"".Sadly in 1985 he is killed in a roller coaster accident at Six Flags over Texas.Or maybe not."
1,flimsy product,the whole strap and unit would slide up and down while trying to run and then the actual lamp would not stay stationary in the same place either while running
2,Disgracefully poor writing skills marred this book.,I have never written reviews but I was so inspired by my distaste for this book that I could not resist. The content in this book might be helpful but the mediocre writing skills of the authors made it impossible to read. The grammar was of a sub-high school level and yielded confusing sentences. The writing style was also very unprofessional thus undermining the credibility of the authors. This one really made the O'Reilly reptutation drop a notch for me. What a catastrophe!
2,The book was lacking,I don't know if it was just me but I didn't get the point of the book. The authors mainly introduced a bunch of concepts but they didn't do anything with them. It also seemed like the book was used for telling us why IAs are so great. I agree but I didn't buy the book for that. Disappointing since I was looking forward to reading the book.
3,Information Architecture for the World Wide Web,"This book was a bit too abstract for me -- a software developer -- but it may appeal to professional information architects and librarians. There is a lot about labeling and classification, and even on less technical subjects such as business strategies and internal politics and marketing. I had expected more on usability-related issues, but as the author states this is a separate field... The last chapter with case studies was nevertheless quite insightful, and there are a lot of pointers to interesting resources throughout the book."
3,"Good reference material, but not really a page-turner","Lots of good information in this book - it covers a huge amount of information related to Information Architecture (as you might expect). Very in-depth, and a great resource. I only give it three stars though because it isn't really a great read. I know, it's a book on IA, what do you expect, right? The book is college textbook size and written in that dry O'Reilly-book style that makes it something you just have to slog through. So maybe I have too high of expectations or too short of an attention span, but it was a big challenge for me to make it through this whole thing. Again, I'm glad I have it on my shelf for reference though.The third edition keeps the book pretty up-to-date. Other than some random old school Netscape screenshots, all the content is totally applicable in today's world."
2,"An ok overview of the topic, with very little useful info","Although this book does provide a nice overview of the field of IA, it provided me with very little useful information in regards to advanced IA techniques and practices. The few bits of useful information that I found we're sandwiched between pages upon pages of common sense, no-brainer techniques.If your a beginner in the fields, or an outsider hoping to learn about IA, perhaps you might benefit from this book. If you've been in the industry for awhile, I'd suggest getting your IA info from a better source. Information Architecture: Blueprints For The Web is a good one. So are Defensive Design for The Web, and Getting Real, by 37 Signals."
2,Many Facts Wrong,"As a great fan of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire I am pretty familiar with many facts concerning both of their lives. Apart from the misleading ""thoughts"" that Gene Kelly should have had during the AFI Awards, which is the author's invention,nearly 60 % of the describing of this Gala is wrong: Fred Astaire could not have talked to his younger wife, as she was not there. The younger lady with him was his daughter Ava! The author also let Fred Astaire's first wife die five years prior to her original death. So that was not the reason for Mr.Astaires first retirement. The list could go on forever. The book makes a nice reading, unfortunately many facts are totally wrong."
1,pitiful- these are going back,i've inserted brand new batteries and i certainly get enough sun to charge these suckers as i live in florida- still- i had to actually go outside to see if they were working as i couldn't tell any difference between them and my regular pathlights. floodlights they are not. being returned to amazon they are.
4,Nice job,had a set with 3 lights and did not give off enough light. the 4th light makes a difference
1,It said it would work with Mac!,"I bought this at Target since the package said it would work with PC or Mac. This turned out to be incorrect. I did get it to blink while setting the sound input to USB, but it never recognized what it was, just ""unknown USB source"". It did not get recognized in Garage Band either, which is why I bought it to start with. On a whim, I found a 1/8 converter, popped that on my regular guitar cord, and plugged it in the Mac. Surprise, it started working.Go figure. I'll try it a few more times before completely giving up."
1,"Not working too well, dissappointing.","Took it out of the box, hoping to use it with Waves Gtr, Digital performer, on my Macbook protheres a constant buzz, and ticking the same speed as the blinking green krytonite LEDin digital performer, you can use it as an input, but can't change the output to another source.Waves GTR would not recognize it.the only thing that would was Garage band,I tried the 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter, and it worked fine, but you can get that for $10.00 at Radio shack."
5,Lenmar DVDP703 Li-ion Battery for Panasonic DVD Players,"This is a great replacement battery. Just as good, if not better than the original and about 1/3 the cost."
4,Alex's reveiw,A very interesting and amazing book to read. In the novel Mihaly lives his life and is learning to become the man he is to become. Throughout the novel he is building his character and emerging as the person he will become. Many things can be learned in this novel and must be read in depth for it has many hidden messages and meanings. I truly enjoyed reading it. This is a great book to read and I advice for other to read this masterpiece.
3,the traveler,"The Traveler is an interesting story about a man named Mihaly who deals with overcoming an obsession and finding himself. Mihaly's journey begins while he is on his honeymoon in Italy and starts to take flight during a sudden separation between him and his new wife. During their separation, they each travel to different areas of Europe and learn to live on their own and try to find themselves. Mihaly and his wife live lives that run parallel to each other. Mihaly works to overcome a suicidal obsession with a childhood friend and learns that he cannot live the life or die the death of his friend. And his wife learns how to fend for herself and she learns that she does not need a man to give her purpose. It may take a few reads to truly understand the deep ties that lie between Mihaly and his old friends and to understand the internal conflicts that Mihaly faces but it is a good story about finding your own way in life."
4,The Traveler,"Overall I must say the Traveler by Antal Szerb is a very interesting book. The book was very detailed to make the reader aware of the locations and the surroundings of the characters. It mentions a lot of European history. The book is about the main character, Mihaly and his journey around Italy. He seems to be very nostalgic and compares everything in the present back to his teenage years. The book reminds me of a love triangle. The main themes of this book are love and death. I would recommend this book to anyone to read."
4,The Traveler,"Beautifully composed and poetically styled, Mr. Hargitai's translation of Antal Szerb's masterpiece is definitely a must-read. Hargitai reveals all the dark and confusing secrets that the novel and his author had. The main character journeys all over Italy to find his true self only to encounter obstacles that prevent him from reaching the happiness he once had. After reading the whole novel the discovery of Tamas and Eva being the same person, the whole mystery is exposed and the reader is able to understand the novel's androgyny theme. Throughout his travels, Mihaly has been in many flings with women, which tends to make this book a romance novel. He tries to find his true self; he uses these romances and signs of lust with these women as a way to express himself as a man. I recommend this to those who love romance novels."
3,Pretentious,"Really, the first XTC album that was this uneven. In trying to create a more ""adult"" music, the band lose excitement or relevance and produce a yawner of an album.Colin Moulding retains his touch - ""My Bird Performs"" and ""The Smartest Monkeys"" are classic XTC songs.Much of the rest of this though just sits on the floor and stares at you, daring you to like it. ""Peter Pumpkinhead"" is a good song, but the production inflates the instruments to grotesque levels and ruins the effect."
5,A fine album unjustly ignored.,"Andy Partridge is one of the great pop writers ever. ""Dear Madam Barnum"" and ""The Disappointed"" are just two examples of perfect song craftsmanship. Production throughout is crystal clear and the playing is excellent. One or two songs have dated, especially ""Crocodile"", and Colin Mouldings ""War Dance"". His ""My Bird Performs"" and "" Smartest Monkeys"" are quite wonderful though. Almost as good as their ""Black Sea"" album."
3,Its was bareable,"I have to admit that that this movie doesnt compare to the first or third, but it is fun to watch sometimes. Yes, the cockroach scene is great. And Kirsten... oh geez, it's not like Freddy twisted Kirsten's arm to get her to bring Alice into the picture. Wow,that part [angered me]. hehe. That damn Kirsten , it's all her fault. I see why Patricia Arquette didn't want to come back. But the movie has some memorable scenes. It's worth checking out."
5,Visually pleasing,"Renny Harlin's direction of ""The Dream Master"" was visually pleasing. The only bad thing about that is, and it's a biggie, is that it took away Freddy's wickedness (which Wes Craven put some ""oomph"" back into with ""Dream Warriors"").The new Kristen, Tuesday Knight, stunk. She overemphasized emotions way too much and became an annoyance as a result. Thank God that only lasted about a quarter of the film, if that.I can watch this repeatedly and become more pleased with the visual effects each time. I love the way the movie was shot and how the story became centered around Alice (after the last three kids of the parents who originally killed Freddy were bumped off)."
1,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,This Nightmare on Elm Street is by far the worse thus far in the series. The only thing good about this movie is that the annoying people die first.
1,This Movie is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a terrible Movie, I mean, they never Thought about the deaths. Example, someguy just gets stabed in the stomach and when they showed it, it did not show not even a drop of blood! And one more thing, there is a long nudeity scene and I know why they showed it, because they were desprate!Got Milk?"
4,great movie great enhanced dvd quality,"When i bought this movie i thought that it was gonna be poor vhs quality. Well i hwas wrong this dvd is great quality, you can not tell that this film was made in 1988. The storyline is not as good as the previous nightmare on elm sreet movies. (...) I found the (..) sceens to be highly disopointing i expected better from director Renny Harlin .This film is overall a good movie, but i cant sit throught it again for the forth time. I recomend this disc to any one who is a fan of those cheap hokey 80's horror films. But if you have not seen any of these films before a great starter is nightmare on elm street 3:the dream warriors.Well i will let u check this one out for yourself.p.s If you ignore the major fleas in this film you will enjoy it alot more."
2,More Of A Horror/Comedy,"This one is more like a horror/comedy. Freddy's hilarious in this one, and he really gets his revenge, too, having one of the highest death counts, in the series. This one has a lot of special effects. This one is better than part 5, by a longshot.This one has the second most laughs in the series. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, has the first. But this one is pretty hilarious, too."
2,NOT TOO GOOD,"This is not the best in the series due to it's stupidity and extreme cheesyness. If you want to see a good one rent 1 or 7!!RATED R : FOR VIOLENCE, LANGUGE AND BRIEF NUDITY"
4,Old School Hip Hop,Great album. Brings back memories. This is definitely a must buy for those of you that are into that old school hip hop.
5,"Yea, i still listing to diz album...","If you love hip-hop ? You'll know that diamond d is a genious and know exectly what he does.Anyways, Diamond & the Psychotic neurotics's "" Stunts,Blunts & Hip-Hop"" is an album that is pure hip-hop with great lirycs and one of the best production dat i've ever heard. Recommended."
1,Internet Performance Survival Guide by Jess Huston STINKS.,"Not sure about these other reviews but all I can say is make sure to buy yourself a package of Tylenol's with this book, because after reading a few pages your head will be ready to explode. I am trying to read this book with other 25 people and not one person has said that this book is good. Make sure that you have alot of spare time if you are going to read this crap, because you will be taking more naps while trying to get through this book, then all the naps you have taken throughout your whole lifetime. Geoff Huston would make a great lawyer but not a book writer."
5,Gnomeriffic.,"For the U of M fan with a yard. Bought two, both were in good shape/paints fine. Smaller than I expected, but it is the size listed. Went over well under the xmas tree, if I ever have need for a football gnome again, this is where I would look first. Thanks."
5,NCAA Michigan Gnome,"I am a Michigan fan and I love this gnome, we named him Jethro and he sat with us during the Michigan vs OSU game, he did his job WE WON... GO BLUE.!!!!!"
2,garden gnome,"A real let down the pictures look so good, but in reality they are very small and get lost outdoors in a garden setting, the plants overwhelm them, good price but they are not very practical"
2,Their downhill slide,"Now without the guitars of Terry Vickers for this, the album following Babe Rainbow, it's charitable to say that any fan should start with the earlier, late 80s sounds of what was a fine band until they lost their key sound architect--who went on to form Levitation, by the way. The original HoL lineup has reformed with a new album in 2004/5."
5,EXCELENTE!!,"EL PRUDUCTO FUE ENTREGADO CON LAS ESPECIFICACIONES MOSTRADAS, EN EL TIEMPO OPORTUNO Y EN LA FECHA ESTIMADA. RECOMIENDO 100%. EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!"
2,Learning GNU emacs,"I found this book to be not that good. It is a bit long winded, I had a hard time using the index to find things that I was looking for. It helped me get a bit more expertise but didn't help me get to a very good level of expertise. I rarely use this book now, I would recommend looking else where for a better book to both learn and use as a reference. Wrong first buy or only buy."
2,Poor Attempt at Recreating the Magic of the Original Rascals,"My young kids love the original little Rascals that are available on video and which, until recently aired on AMC on Sunday mornings. They were very disappointed with this fake-looking, slow and poorly-acted attempt that fails miserably to recreate the magic of the original Our Gang. The characters are mismatched too! What made the original work was that many of what was done was impromptu with the kids acting at being themselves. In this movie, the kids are trying to copy other people working from a script and it just doesn't work.Try to find the originals on video if you can."
4,It woz veri funee...,"This was an excellent tribute movie and the negative reviews are probably the result of the nostalgic ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" mentality. Just keep chewing on the baccy grandpa...And as for the comment it was too ""P.C."" - maybe you still want the Afro American kids to say stuff like ""My old man's in prison and drinks all the time""?I reckon it was pretty funny and so does my four year old daughter and after all, this is a kid's movie."
5,Little Rascals,My son loved it and has now memorized 95% of the lines! He loves Buckwheat and all the other characters. I am pretty sure he would join the Heman Women Haters club any day of the week.
2,Glazed over....,I read this in under 2 hours; most all of this info can be found in other marriage 'self-help' books. Not necessary.
1,Don't buy it! Not wort it.,"A lots of lies. So negative! And a lots of areas (when she talks about mens visual ""Rolodex"") are not true for a lots of men up there."
5,"Dr. Gary Cosel - clinical psychologist, and a Man","A ""Must Read"" for not only every woman, but for men as well. Short, easy to read, and to the point. Research based findings give it more credibility - these ""absolute truths"" about men are delivered poignantly and with grace. Hard to believe that a psychologist and married Christian man could be surprisingly halted in the midst of a read to acknowledge, ""Shaunti Feldhahn has really got it right!"" Designed not only for Christians but for secular non-believers as well. This book is a more woman friendly read than Dr. Laura Schlessinger's, The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands. I look forward to her sequel, For Men Only, projected release April, 2006. Thank you Shaunti Feldhahn."
4,The inner lives of men,"There's a lot of good information in this book, and it does describe much of what goes on in the minds of men, however, as any study will show its own results, it cannot apply to all men from all backgrounds and dispositions. Naturally men want to be catered to, however there must also be a balance for women as well. I think the author did a good job in describing how many men think, and I digress that what women think is equally important. This is an interesting read and I do recommend it for some insight. I also suggest the book ""Stop Being the String Along"" by Barbara Rose for relationship answers taking all sides and equal balance within the relationship into account."
5,Awesome,"If you are looking to find out how your man thinks, this book will help. I have found it very useful and recommend everyone whether you are in a relationship or not to read it. The book was in perfect condition and shipped quickly. Thanks Amazon!"
5,A Refreshing Book,"I read this book with other women and watched the video that the author put together. The entire book was eye opening, encouraging, convicting, humbling and funny. I would want any woman who has a desire to see their marriage through their husbands eyes to read this book."
5,This Book is 30 Years too Late.,"I have been married for 35 years. A person needs to read both For Men Only and For Women only to understand the truthful nature of the content. As a man reading this book, I could relate to each survey and fit myself into at least one of the categories discussed. This is very revealing of the inner thoughts of men, and accurate.Early in my marriage, a chasm occurred between my wife and I when I brought home problems from the office and discussed them with her, looking for her counsel. I would ultimately get mad at her and not the problem because of the way she looked at the problem. I ultimately stopped discussing these problems with her since I wasn't finding the answers I needed. This book explains to me what went wrong in that conversation in which I came away mad. I wish I had the book then so that I could understand how she was looking at the problem.This is a great read regardless of how long you have been married."
2,"This book gives good information, yet it uses information from other books and articles","I read this book and noticed that a lot of the information concerning men came from another book that I had just read titled Love and Respect by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs. Shaunti Feldham even refers to Emerson Eggerichs by name and uses words directly from his book and his website. Why write a book and have half of your book have quotes from another author's book? Shaunti Feldham said that she did a lot of research and surveys, however most of the book seems to be other authors ideas, articles, and quotes."
2,common knowledge,"This book was a waste of my money. The things in this book are common knowledge, I would hope. If you are absolutely clueless about men, then you might benefit from it."
3,Some insight into the male mind based on questionnaires/interviews...,"I respect Ms Feldhahn's diligence in obtaining enough data to provide sound interpretations. She also consulted a statistician when composing the questions and determining the number of subjects to interview.The first half of the book was well organized and contained great information in a concise manner. The second half of the book was not as interesting and I felt that the author may have been under pressure to fill a certain number of pages with type.Basically, I learned a few new things in a short time for a few bucks."
1,Bad Book,"I dont know how much research the author did before writing this book, but even with the sparse facts that do exist, it would have been possible to write a book that is both an interesting read and factual in terms of what is known.Instead the author chose otherwise and I was highly dissapointed because of that. If your looking for a well done and factual novel based on the legend of Calico Jack, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, try James Nelson's ""The Only Life That Mattered""."
2,don't judge a book by it's cover.,"The cover of this book makes it look like a book of photo-copyable pages, each with small squares on it to give to kids as ""do nows"" before each day's lesson. It's not. The book's ""5-minute problems"" are a list of problems, much like on the MCAS where each problem builds on the previous one. There is no separation.I wanted a book of completely autonomous 5-minute math problems to give to my kids. What I got was an MCAS prep book."
5,5 Minute Math-Problem of the Day,I have used these problem of the day sheets in my classroom everyday with great success. I would highly recommend them to any parent or teacher.
4,Helpful and Useful Before Remarrying,"Several years after my divorce became final, I started dating a divorced guy. Long story short: we're remarried and blending a family.This book is one of three or four books about remarriage that I read before actually agreeing to get married again. It is helpful and useful; I found myself skipping around within the sections and not reading every word.I've since found another book by these authors with almost the same title. I actually like the other book better. The title is the same, without ""Second"" in the language. I think the other book ""Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts"" is actually stronger than this one.Buy either one, with our without ""Second"" in the title. Both are helpful.Lauren HodgeApple Valley, CaliforniaI also highly recommend this book:Happily Remarried: Making Decisions Together * Blending Families Successfully * Building a Love That Will Last"
3,"Good for learning Perl, Bad as a reference","If you are wanting to learn perl, this book will help you do that. It jumps in quickly into how to code perl, so be prepared. If you have coded C++, then this perl won't be that hard with this book. However, if you've never programmed before, then this is not the book for you.Once I had learned perl, I found this book to be a 500 page paper weight. It does little good as a reference."
3,Ditto,"Echo the same comments: + good raw material. Coverage on OO is very good, not just for Perl programmers but anyone interested in OO. One of the better intro to OO I've seen. - Yes, Index section sucks (editors are falling asleep on their jobs) - Yes, lots of errors (editors are falling...)Just by focusing on fixing the two minuses will make the next edition one of the better Perl books.Also, next to nothing in terms of coverage of OS interaction, networking, etc. Granted the book is pretty thick as it is, but calling it a ""complete"" reference is a bit of a stretch, IMO."
5,Read Me Their Live Show,"Read this and you'll come to know why Gabriel's Genesis was so good live act. Theatrical shows, fascinating customs and proge music that touched many people. Those were the days before the great success. In my opinion, Gabriel's year were Genesis greatest for musically. Many pictures and interesting stories will reveal you many interesting things for band members. Highly recommand for every Genesis fan!"
3,A clever addition,Even though this film tended to drag on the same old plot all over again I still thought it was just as good as the others. I liked how they did that scene where the boy turned himself into his own comic book hero and has a dou with Freddy. Some of the scenes were still kind of scary like the opening scene.
2,ok,"this movie is deffinately weak, not bad but weak. everyone is going through all the deaths with just some good scenes with freddy and LISA"
2,"Amusing entry in the series, but rather lacking","Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2) helmed this fifth entry into the Nightmare on Elm Street series where we find Alice (Lisa Wilcox), the survivor from the previous Dream Master, pregnant with Freddy once again on the prowl. It is here where the series begins to try to dish up more details on Freddy's past to add to the story; but hardly anything can save this dismal installment. Freddy's one liners are stupid and aren't funny one bit, the acting is simply horrid (Robert Englund just looks more bored in his role than ever before), and the film as a whole isn't scary one bit. The few saving graces of The Dream Child are Hopkins' stylish direction and some nice kills and gore effects, but for the most part this entry is just plain dull."
3,"Nine, ten, never sleep again!!!!!!!","If any of you thought Nightmare on Elmstreet 4 was bad, you'll agree with me when I say this one was along the same lines as its previous one, if not worse.Freddy is back again (doesn't he ever stay dead?)to overpower Alice and Dan's unborn child, Jacob. Dan, Alice's boyfriend from the previous film, is Freddy's first victim by frying him on a motorcycle.I don't know what happened to the excitement and horror that made us go see the original, but if I were you I would've stopped going to the theatre after #3, because after that they go down hill, except for Wes Craven's New Nightmare. That one was really cool!!"
4,"""When The Franchise Started Losing Steam""","By the time ""A Nightmare on Elm Street-Part 5: The Dream Child"" was released in 1989 the writers started coming up with asinine ideas for the film's characters thus the film started losing its appeal to its cult audience. The only good thing about the movie (beside the wonderful Freddy) is that we get even more background info on how Freddy was born, his terrible upbringing and his mother.However, the film lost its punch with me although the special effects are innovative, some of the actors are good, but the material didn't mean anything. Ultimately the film grossed only $22,000,000 at the box office, but New line Cinema still decided it made enough money for their to be yet even another sequel."
4,Underrated Sequel,"Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream ChildFreddy wants to come back! So he uses the dreams of Jacob, an unborn baby within Alice, to get to the kids again. Now, Alice must find Amanda Krueger to stop the demonic murderer.This Freddy flick is a very underrated sequel. This has some great comedy and very little gore. When there is gore, it's pretty intense! I rented the unrated version, which I reccomend! I give this sequel a 7 out of 10."
3,It's ok,"The book is just so so, thought it's an old book, but the condition is also old, it has a bad smell, and I don;t want to use this book any more"
1,Publisher's product is worthless and an insult,I was disgusted by this publisher's product. The stupid disclaimer was insulting. I also found the cover choice to be poor. I suggest Amazon might be a bit more selective in the publishers they use. I returned all four copies and ended up buying the Graywolf version from B&N.
5,A small treasure full of powerful words of wisdom,"This is the best book I've read on the process of writing, and on expressing one's creativity. I wish I had found it years ago! I especially appreciate the quotes she uses from artists and writers (namely Van Gogh and William Blake) to help explain the creative process and how important it is to express it every day and without fear of criticism. Wonderful."
5,If You Want To Write,"Excellent book/in perfect condition! The info gained in this book for the writing I love to do...money can't buy! It helped so much about taking any fear of submitting my work away/plus...it taught so much about the importance of being truthful in your writing/being YOU! The book goes everywhere with me! I also love the long history of the author/and, the book...my kind of lady!!"
1,Hypocritical,"I found this woman to be a bit crazy. One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate. She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view. I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash. She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing. I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way. It's like a recipe for disaster. Anyway, that's just my take on it. Take from it what you will."
5,The most marvelous book,I have only read the first two chapters but it is the most marvelous book I have ever read. I just love the author! She speaks to my heart!This book is a must read for everyone not just aspiring writers!
3,A Gift,I purchased this for my daughter. I've read it previously and think its a great book but I'm disappointed with the new cover. The previous cover with the old style pen would have more universal appeal especially because of her recent devorce she's not crazy about men at this time! Jon C
3,songs only have one meaning,"While this book is interesting in some of the fun facts regading each Beatle song every written, and the photos are fantastic, the author keeps letting us know that John was lazy and maladjusted, whie Paul, of course, was the golden boy. He also seems to tow the party line that lyrics do not have multiple meanings; that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is only about one of Julian's drawings, Blue Jay way is only about Derek getting lost and being late, etc. Annoying and fun, worth having if you love them too."
5,MUST READ!! For all you prophecy lovers...,"A.P. does an excellent job of discrediting and condigning Scolfield for what he really is...he was an arrogant, pompous, egotistical theological charlatan...so why do so many believe what he had to say and believe? His interpretation's are evidence of the powerful deceptive ways in which Satan has penatrated and invaded the Christian church. For more on this look up: ""The Incredible Scofield and His Book"" by Joseph M. Canfield.After you come to terms with 'all you ever learned about prophecy was falsly written by an instrument of Satan' then read about the end times from Ellis H Skolfield's book: ""Islam in the End Times"" (no relation, different spelling)If you're reading this with an open mind for learning the truth, you're about to begin a most fascinating journey!"
3,It's okay...,"I heard a lot of great things about Shisheido and especially this line.Pros:-smells good-nice textureCons:-doesn't brighten my face whatsoever.For the few pros it has, it's not really worth the price."
2,(s)Noir..,"I have to be in the minority and say this movie just didn't really hold my attention. The pace was excruciatingly slow. Jack Nicholson, perhaps because I have seen him in so many other movies, seem to be acting...like Jack Nicholson. The plotline, as mentioned by other posters, switches mid-stream from Water and Power, to the daughter-father dynamic. I enjoy hard-boiled characters, but this film just felt flat. All around. The cinematography was great though, but, like another critique said, it gave the film the uncertain time-period feel."
2,not for me,I hated this movie. It was boreing... Though it had a good twist. The incest in this movie was too much for me.
3,Really a 3.5,"Not a diamond, but comparing this with L.A.Confidential is like comparing a ruby with paste jewelry. The implausibilities of that film make Chinatown look like a documentary. Great acting, and an intriguing tale. The ambience of the time could have been thicker. Knowing the ""secrets"" make second viewings not nearly as good as the first, but this is an inherent weakness of all mysteries. The DVD video shows some signs of deterioration of the film, but it is still good. The retrospective interviews are good, but a feature-length commentary would have added considerably to this edition. (Criterion: are you listening?) 4 for the movie, 3 for the DVD."
2,"Fine performances, but...","Watchable for the performances, but wildly overrated, as is nearly every Polanski film. ""LA Confidential"" probably could not exist if ""Chinatown"" hadn't, but the truth is ""Confidentail"" is everything this film isn't. Now if we could have just time-morphed Nicholson and Dunaway into ""Confidential..."""
4,The sledge-o-matic collection,"I've seen Gallagher back in the 90's both from his comedy tapes and have seen him live. Pretty funny guy. This was a perfect collection of all his material.Some of his shows in this collection are kinda dated, but for the most part isn't bad. Few of the shows in this collection such as messing up texas and an uncensored evening are kinda boring, the messing up texas show was censored, and he spent the better part of the show playing with his nephew on stage. The uncensored evening was in front of like 50 people in what appeared to be a bar and was boring as well.They put the better episodes in the beginning 2 dvd's while the last 2 are... ok. Weren't his best material.I'd say buy this if your a true Gallagher fan, cause who doesn't seeing like smashed melons?"
1,Tired of bad DVD's,"In the world of DVD I have had to endure poorly manufactured DVD's before but this has to be the worst. Disappointing too, since I have been waiting for the great comedian Gallagher to show up on DVD. This product is a disaster. First off the packaging claims the audio format is 5.1 Dolby Stereo, it's not. But the video is at the bottom of the scale for quality as well. Should have known better when there's over 12 hours of programming on only 4 discs. Buyer beware stay away from this DVD. In fact better stay away from any DVD's distributed by ""Anchor Bay Entertainment"" After talking to them they could care less that they shot a $30 hole in my wallet and refused to refund. Another Grade A business in America???"
5,Great pan,"Pan is made very well. Love the cover, we use it to bake chicken. Its used at least 3 time a week."
3,Nordic cake pan,"Good points:light weight,clean way to transport cake.easily cleanedBad points:Hard to manipulate the lid.Scratches easily."
1,-10 star,This is the most waste of time show... Minus 10 stars!!!! What a joke... What a slap in the face to the victims of that day... Why don't you spend your time chasing Big Foot
3,Repulsion & Let's Scare Jessica to Death & See No Evil,"The terrible titled ""The Uninvited"" -- (really? That was the best title you could come up with?) -- actually is a well crafted thriller that's very slow and moody and ultimately doesn't go anywhere.It's a mix of Repulsion & Let's Scare Jessica to Death & See No Evil (Mia Farrow.)But while it borrows from all three films, it never locks into place to tell a coherent story. But there is a solid 40 or 50 mins worth of creep in this, just no payoff."
1,"Boring, neverending",One of the worst films I've ever seen. Endless. I fast-forwarded through the last 30 minuted. Unwatchable.
5,Hillbilly dreams,"Born and raised in the Ozarks between the Missouri and Arkansas rivers; we didn't think we would find anything in this ocean cookbook that would excite us. Just goes to prove that hillbillys are sometimes (but not often) wrong.For instance last week the cookbook was used to prepare some great ""tailgate"" dishes; our guests were impressed. But we had to tell the truth, its Annie's book. Two guests used our computer to log on and order the book.Along with barbque the book's dishes appear in a hillbilly's dreams."
2,Whisper close,"The seat did not perform as expected. It closed at first with a slight noise,and now it just slams shut. I would return it but we are over 30 days."
3,not worth it,"Why would a huge plastic container of round cheese balls be selling for over 20 dollars? Are you kidding me? And the worst part is that the regular cheese curls are a thousand times crunchier and tastier anyway. Cheese balls taste rather hard and lack the cheesy flavor in comparison to the actual curls. Either way expect cheese stains all over your hands, and especially the furniture and Nintendo equipment (including TV and Wii remotes) in the living room. A product that I fail to see why anyone would consider purchasing considering the many flaws."
4,thoughtful,This book surprised me- it slows you down. The entire book takes place in one day. How two married people can so easily live within their own heads and rarely intersect at good conversation. I found the writing beautiful and very true to life. a simple snapshot. a magnifying glass into the mind.
4,Old But Awesome!,This film came out the year my dad was born....1933....its amazing to me to watch a movie this old and still find itthrilling and a bit scarey. If youve read all the other reviews then you know about the Director and Writer...Bla Bla...but overall..let me tell you...this movie is cool..Odd and a bit insane...circus freaks and their daily lives....a bit like a soap opera....but oh so demented....if you like twisted tales of love and revenge then watch this.I waited about 15 years to finally see this film....it was well worth the wait....
5,"Excellent, it shows another side of life we don""t often see.","I was very drawn to this movie. A previous reviewer forgot to mention Frances, the girl with no arms. My definite favorite. This culture should have been preserved, instead of ridiculed. I was impressed by their commitment to each other. A must see."
4,very good,It is not a pc subject but it is very thought provoking and is very forward thinking for its day and age. Very entertaining and as medicine has moved on since the film an insight into what happened to disabled or deformed people. But the twist in the tale is that these people have the laft laugh.
1,POOR QUALITY,"Love the movie, but this so called ENHANCED VERSION is really poor quality. so bad you can hardly view it! Get te orginal release its much better."
5,An interesting social artifact,"Despite others' comments, I cannot see this movie as humanitarian. While claiming, both in the opening credits and throughout most of the film, to expose the humanity under the mask of circus side-show freakdom, it merely perpetuates different stereotypes and fantastic exaggerations than its predecessors. Instead of relying on the old image of repulsive ""monsters,"" Browning paints a picture of a vengeful cult of extraordinary people who have begun to resent the society that rejects them. In a sense, it is more of a prototypical Browning horror film than it is a humanitarian project. However, the film is still extremely fascinating as a historical artifact; it illustrates America's struggle to come to terms with its past. In the words of Rosmarie Garland Thompson, ""The extraordinary body is fundamental to the narratives by which we make sense of ourselves and our world."""
4,Disturbing Freaks,"This is an incredible movie. Very, very good. It was kept locked up for many years because of the disturbing visuals. The structure, or society, of the traditional Freak show at the old traveling carnivals is accurately portrayed and the script is an excellent exploration of how the Freaks would treat an outsider they had trusted and accepted, who then betrayed them. However, this movie is very difficult to watch. Browning used real freaks - not make up- some of whom, like the pin heads, do not even exist today because of medical advances. I found the movie to be well worth it and rated it at four stars, rather than five, only because I believe that most people would find it takes an effort to watch and not turn away. This is definitely not for children! The ending is incredible."
4,A Classic Masterpiece!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present back in 2005! This is a very good film. When it came out, it was hugely controversial. The idea of actually getting real circus freaks was, at the time, unthinkable. The little woman who played Frieda was pretty hot. In a way, it's not really scary, but shown how they were treated and how they get back at the ones who torment them. If you love classics, you'll love FREAKS!!!""Gooble Goble, Gooble Goble, we accept you one of us!"""
2,Disturbing? Chilling? Are you kidding?,"Having read all the wonderful reviews of ""Freaks"" I just had to get it. I warned my wife before we watched that the film was (allegedly) incredibly disturbing, grotesque and frightening. Let's just say that we didn't even bat an eyelash. Don't get me wrong--it's a very interesting movie. But scary? No way! Yes, the use of actual ""freaks"" in the movie was fascinating, but it surely didn't make us run for the OFF switch on our DVD player. Considering the reviews, the movie was actually quite tame. Really tame. I am frankly shocked it was allegedly banned anywhere at any time. Weren't circus sideshows more prevelant in the 1930's than now? So what's the big deal? I agree that the DVD commentary was excellent, but this was NOT a scary movie. A good film, unique (that's for sure), and overall enjoyable to watch. But I don't see it as a landmark horror flick. Not even close."
5,"Years later, they're still playing with it!","I bought this puzzle for my daughters two years ago, and they still drag it out to play with it! I'm amazed, really, at how much my little girls have enjoyed dressing this princess over and over. My four year old has played with it a lot more than my eight year old, but the oldest still plays with this every now and then, too. This puzzle was a life-saver for doctor's offices, errands, and anytime I needed to keep a busy toddler occupied. It's well worth the money, and it still looks great, even after being tossed around and toted all over town. I'm very impressed."
3,"Cute and durable, but not that entertaining","Melissa & Doug make wonderful, durable products. My daughter pulls this out once in a great while, but is ""over it"" within minutes. Very cute, and it will last FOREVER. It doesn't get enough use at my house, though, and will be yard sale fodder in no time. Because my daughter is into princesses, she likes this one a little better than the ballerina one."
5,Muddy Waters meets The Rolling Stones = A Blast,"Muddy is half way through a gig, at the Checkerboard Lounge, when Mick Jagger, Ronnie and Ian rock up. This is the stuff legends are made of. Unplanned unrehearsed off the cuff fantastic music. Sixteen tracks on this DVD, including, Hoochie Coochie Man, One Eyed Woman, Baby Please Don't Go, Flip Flop And Fly, and two bonus tracks, You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone, and Black Limousine. There are also cameo appearances by Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Lefty Dizz. This is a real jam session, and Blues lovers, this is one great DVD."
1,complaint,"one of the discs doesn't play. It does, however, play in my computer. It is ridiculous to require a certain amount of words."
2,Not an ideal blues mix IMO,"I'm a fan of both Muddy Waters and The Stones but as I suspected when I first saw this DVD here, the two groups together didn't exactly hit it off. To me, the Stones were clearly out of their environment as they tried to be blues guys. Sure, anyone can play the blues but only a few (like Muddy Waters) were/are exceptionally good doing it.What baffles me as why there aren't any good DVDs of Muddy and Johnny Winter as those 2 were great together in the mid-late 70s."
4,Sorry Lefty...,"Awesome Show!!! Lefty was obnoxious though, and you could read it on the faces and in the actions of the band. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. It must have been some record label/ management spotlight deal with him; he certainly didn't earn it. What could have been was reduced when this guy got on stage. I still highly recommend it though; when it's cookin' it is COOKIN'!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Lefty RUINS the show.,"This could of have been a stellar event. Instead it is merely a satisfactory superstar blues jam. I would rather they edited it down to 20 minutes because as soon as a STINKING drunk and OBNOXIOUS Lefty Dizz walks onstage, ALL momentum stops and all the good vibes are killed instantly. His presence on this disc is a blot that cannot be overcome. The few songs with Mick and Muddy, Keef and Woody are fun, not spectacular..its a loose blues jam...and Buddy Guy steals the show despite his seriously out of tune guitar. A must have I suppose, for Stones completists and HARDCORE blues fans but not for the casual fan or the un-initiated. Again BE WARNED....When LEFTY DIZZ walks onstage, he RUINS the show."
2,Check for latest version,"You really need to own the latest version for it to work. I bought version 7, and it doesn't work for anything I've tried so far. When I checked the website I realized that the current version is 12. Oops. Now I'll have to pay more money to upgrade."
5,Palin-esque at it's best,This is probably the best of the Palin travel series - excellent and highly recommended. It's a shame it seems to be so difficult to find!
3,Good story but some major annoyances.,"Everyone else has given you a run down of the plot, so I'll skip that. This is an entertaining read. But to be honest, I'm just holding out for the ""gratuitous"" sex in the future novels that everyone complains about. These first few books are so void of sex and anything romantic, I'd guess Anita is a lesbian. Seriously. Besides the author's refusal to allow Anita to be attracted to, date, or even kiss a male, she repeats the same nerve-grating phrases, such as but not limited to: Nike Airs, Nike swoosh, bully for me, bully for him, Browning, Browning, Browning >:\ Can Jean-Claude please wear something other than lace? And Anita wears printed sweatshirts, jeans, Nikes, and a fanny pack and somehow we are supposed to believe that a hundreds-of-years-old vampire is attracted to her? I think not - not when the book was written in 1995 and not ever!"
3,Not Anne Rice Material,"Yeah well of course this is not Anne Rice material, I bought this book and the previous title at a discount after reading all the reviews I thought it would be a sexy dark read. Laurell K. Hamilton reads more like a gutsy thriller with a strong headed female protagonist (Anita Blake) and supernatural elements involved. It's a fast paced read and easy to digest, but Anita is a serious vampire hunter/neocromancer(raising the dead). She wears a cross and dislikes vampires in general, and yes of course she's a Christian. So it means she doesn't engage philosopical debates about life and death, she doesn't like erotic involvement with creatures of the night, she just shoots and kills."
5,The Ego and the Id,The book was delivered to me complete and in the condition that it was sold to me in. I would recommend and use this seller for future transactions.
1,I can't imagine a worse transfer or worse edit,"If I could give this DVD 1/8 of a star I would have. The VHS/Beta version of this film that was released in 1982 was much better than this DVD in both content and image quality. The transfer of this DVD looks like it was done from 2nd generation VHS tape (probably in EP ot LP mode). Seriously, I have Beta tape of AoH that I dubbed in 1983 from a Sony SL5800 to a Sony SL5400 in SP mode. Twenty years later, that tape still has much better image quality than the DVD. In addition, the DVD is heavily edited. I'm not sure why since it still carries an R rating. Only people who seriously collect Ms. Chambers work should even consider looking at this DVD. It certainly isn't worth a $3.00 rental fee."
3,Good for a Starting Point of Opening Study,"Fine presents alot of information in this book. He covers the main lines for the majority of openings a player will run across. However, reading this book is like reading a dictionary, line after line of moves with little (but informative) annotation.Don't read this book if you want to learn certain openings or how to defend lines. This book is for a general picture of modern openings and why they exist. From this book you can see what openings fit your style of play and the reader can then seek out other books on the lines that he wishes to play. Also, it gives a picture of how to deal with openings the reader doesn't know.4 stars for the informative, but boring/dry writing, but it loses a star for the many many many notation errors in the book. It's very annoying, however, the reader can usually figure out what the intended move is, but still, isn't there an editor for this book?"
2,Overrated ... and wrong on some particulars.,The fact that this book is one of the most recommended chess books around is an inexplicable mystery. The book's approach to the openings is best summed up as simple minded. A particular peeve of mine ... Fine's explanations of the Reti opening are pure guano.
3,Not for the aspiring Master,"Almost every master you encounter will tell you that a key part of being a master is to be comfortable with MODERN chess opening theory. Without this, the game is lost before it even begins.The problem with ""The Ideas Behind Chess Openings"" is that it does no coenside with current chess opening theory. Although Fine does carefully go through each opening as so you can easily understand it, what he is teaching you cannot match what is thought of today.Yes, it is fun to read, but it's junk food. If you are having trouble understanding exactly what an opening is for, and what you want to accomplish in it, then read this book. But if you are looking for a way to come up with new and improved openings, do not buy this book.[This book is for beginners, so I cannot express the ELO gain it gives.]"
3,Beware!,"Unless you are a Master or above, you will most probably learn a lot from this book. BUUUUT---- but but but--- it will take a lot of work, a lot of setting up of pieces on chess boards, and a lot of patience. It is also quite diffucult to find the opening you are looking for."
3,Good book but obsolete,"This is a good book but unfortunately, it is obsolete. It is better to buy opening base."
3,Does a good job telling you the ideas but with outdated analysis,"It is a strong point that this book is now in Algebraic Notation. Few books go into detail on the ideas behind the openings and this is what makes this book different from the MCOs and Encylopedias on openings. However, a flaw and a major flaw is that this book was written long ago and opening theory has changed. This book didn't change along with it. Any suggestions for a book or books that have a decent number of opening lines along with a decent coverage of the ideas behind them? I am looking!!!"
3,Flawed Masterpiece...,"This is truly a great book for beginners and medium-level players. It really helps in understanding the reasons behind the first or so 10-15 moves, rather than mechanically following what the grand masters play. This book should be one of the first in every chess player's library.Why only 3 stars then ? I hear you ask. Well, this edition ""supersedes"" previous ones by converting the moves to the now-popular algebraic notation. Unfortunately, I counted over a dozen mistakes in the conversion. It's already hard enough to follow the hundreds of variations as it is, without inserting red herrings. The proof reading done on this edition is really quite unacceptable !It's quite difficult to follow through the variations to their end using a normal chess board. Too many times positions need to be restored to a certain complicated position. My solution: I went through the book using a chess program on my lap top. It was then easy when required to reset the board to a given move."
4,Excellent first step in developing your opening repertoire.,"The author reviews all of the major games and many of the obscure and exotic openings.Objectivity is not the order of the day here; he discounts some successful lines and completely writes-off others, but the novice chess player looking to develop an opening repertoire should check this one out."
4,Glad to relive the old sounds,"This album rocks! I want you to understand that this comment is coming from someone who owns Starflyer59's Gold record on 3 formats (tape,CD,and vinyl). If you like any of the old stuff that was disgustingly compared to The Smashing Pumpkins, then you'll probably dig this release. For the folks who thought that Silver and Gold albums were ""noise"", here's some advice: Relax, toss aside your misgivings about anything that isn't Coldplay or Radiohead, drop your head... that's right, look down... c'mon just do it, look at your shoes, now sway... no no, sway side to side, there ya go, now you're shoegazing. And that's what it's all about. Oops, sorry about that. What? No, I didn't mean to knock you over while you were swaying. :-P"
2,Not My Favorite SF59 Album,"This may be the worst effort from SF59 to date. The album has a few good moments but is not even in the same class as other efforts such as Silver, Gold, Americana, le Vainqueur and, my favorite, Everybody Makes Mistakes. I don't think that Jason's going back to the old sound anytime soon, so it's best to get over it. In the meantime, if you want that same ""classic"" SF59 sound, I have found an alternative. Check out an album called 'Futura Black' by a band called Guitaro, who are out of Canada. It's got male/female vocals, classic SF59 guitars and power chords galore. And, if you want a great SF59 album, pick out their latest one, 'Talking Voice vs. Singing Voice'... which is a triumphant return to form."
1,A huge disappointment,"Compared to the two previous ""MCSE in a Nutshell"" (Core Exams & Elective Exams for NT 4.0), this book is a major disappointment! It's really valuable as a highlighter's index only - for that you're better off downloading the free stuff from Cramsession.com! The review questions are far too basic. When I did the review for 70-217 (Active Directory administration), I got all the ones in this book right, but only scored about 60% on the questions found in the readiness review from MS Press. Using the MS Press review, I wound up scoring 883/1000 on the actual exam. The Windows 2000 exams' difficulty was cranked up a notch and this book falls short."
2,frustrating,"This is a great product for people with IT jobs. I had difficulty getting it going I bought a new computer to run it better and this created a new set of problems. I'm not an idiot with a computer and I found the entire experience extremely frustrating. The base program works for me now, but The webracing does not work for me anymore, but it does for others. I bought the program for webracing primarily since I already have a computrainer.They cannot seem to figure out why it crashes. I get an e- mail question about my problem every 4 days or so. This company is just not on top of service issues.I am hoping someone else makes a better program that does the same this because when it did work, it was great.- Getting flabby"
1,Nothing Good,"Wow, one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Predictable, and boring. This movie is five as short as the original Ten Commandmants but seems fives longer. Waste of time."
2,Kinda torn,"As a Christian myself an movie that mentions God or uses the Bible in any way I don't feel too comfy about, because more than likely they'll put doubts into peoples minds.....Was the ""Science of the 7 plagues on the DVD extra really necessary?"" Science and the Bible go together like peanut butter and cheese, you can eat it...but why?I love Hilary Swank, love the effects...confused about the message of the film. They bring Hilary back into believing in God, but only after she puts doubts into everyone's mind.Honestly I was half asleep when i watched it, film started off incredibly on the slow side. Also some bad acting by some."
1,I'm Weeping.,"I'm not even going to bother with a full review, this movie isn't worth my time or energy to write about. Simply put, this movie is bad, not just bad, but horrendous, ugly, silly and trite. Phrases like ""brain dead"" and ""insulting to all intelligent beings"" does not even come close to describing the hole this film dug itself. It's almost like a seriousHot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)with biblical plagues, can you possibly see that? Its bad people, avoid this like a plague (no pun intended. Okay, maybe it was).Re-watch value; EXTREMLY low."
2,"Oh my, a lightly perspiring Swank!","The main problem with The Reaping is that it's entirely derivative: the basic premise is one that has been covered many times before. The film certainly looks good: you can't fault the production from a visual point of view, but what Hollywood fails to realise time and time again is that effects alone do not a movie make. The CGI is very good, with some particularly convincing digital locusts, but it's all too `in your face' and along with the tired plot line and cardboard characters, the film never engages the viewer and therefore fails to scare or shock. The overblown ending is especially unsubtle and unconvincing. There's only one revelation here and that's how sexy Hilary Swank can be!"
3,STUCK TO THE NORMS,"this was a pretty, fairly good movie, sticking to regular formula of the typical excoricism-ish appeal.CONCLUSION:if you have time to kill i would definately recommend buying/renting it for the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Great fun armchair cruising,"Nearly a laugh out loud romp around a not so typical cruise ship week. There are plenty of descriptive true references to a real cruise ship and the cruising experience to make any cruiser feel at home. But after that, the trip sails into uncharted waters. The characters are quirky and fun, the plot a few degrees off the compass center leaving the reader never certain what direction you are headed in. Don't bother taking the trouble to pack a suitcase, just sit in the sun somewhere and enjoy this armchair trip!"
2,Had to send back it wouldn't stay on to charge my nectar navagator.,"Had to return my product. Wouldn't stay on to charge my nextar navagation system , it kept blinking on and off."
5,A book to get lost in,I read Jane Eyre for the first time in my early 30's. I could not put it down. It is one of those few books where the author's voice gets in your head. I recently downloaded it so that I could revisit it. A marvelous book for anyone.
4,Jane Eyer,"This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights"
5,Jane Eyre from Amazon,"Still a classic love story, this was the first book I selected to read on my Kindle. Easy to read, and story pulls you in no matter how old you are!"
1,jane eyre,i got this book for free and i only read the first couple of pages and i was immediately uninterested in it.. so much that i fell asleep during class when i was reading it
2,Jane Eyre,"Okay, when I first read it, I absolutely hated it. Maybe because me too was expecting Jane Austen. But it has some good things: you learn a lot, it gives to you good lessons. But is extremely dramatic, unrealistic (a man with a crazy woman hidden in his house??????????????). So, it has lot of things that leaves you like (?) and reminded me mexican soap operas :p. Me too don't see why it was so highly rated. If you want something good, that leads you to know the character's personality, go read Jane Austen."
5,Great read,"I heard from a friend that the newer movie was good, but I wanted to read the book before seeing it. I liked Wuthering Heights but I had never read a novel by any of the other Bronte sisters. It turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read. It starts off slow but gets better. I prefer this one to Wuthering Heights because it isn't as over-dramatic and has a happy ending. Several unexpected twists and a great love story."
5,Extraordinary!,"It is amazing that the themes of a novel written in the early 1800's are still relevant in current time. This story speaks of cruelty, passion, struggle, friendship and passionate romantic love. Of course, the style of writing is wordy and flowery at times and perhaps overly descriptive, but I loved it! A classic that everybody should read."
5,A Mesmerizing Read,"I had wanted to read Jane Eyre since I was a little girl because, for some strange reason, I was always drawn to the novel. It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me. I felt that I too grew in some ways and what more could one want from a novel?"
2,Not a fan of classics.,I'm just not a fan of classics. I only read it because it was free. Maybe an English major would appreciate it more.
5,The movie made me want to read the book,This has got to be my favorite book of all times. Jane Eyre suffered and she remained strong and determained. She was in love with this man who found her purity and loyality to be everything.
5,a classic surprise,I chose Jane Eyre because it was free and I had nothing to read. I ended up loving it and understanding why it is a well-deserved classic!
2,I should have - but I didn't!,"I don't know how I missed reading Jane Eyre before this, and fully expected to love every moment of the book. But despite my best efforts I was relieved when I finished it. I felt that somehow it hadn't aged well. (Of course I am quite prepared to accept that this is a fault in me and not in Charlotte Bront!!)"
4,I heart Mrs. Kadletz ...and Jane Eyre!,"Although this novel was required reading for me, I really enjoyed it. The plot was semi- precictable, however the way that the plot was unveiled was creative and twisted. I enjoyed the realistic character of Jane with her insecurities and imperfect appearance. Rochester also embodies a realistic, darker, yet genuine aspect of human nature. I liked the characterization in the book as well as the diction of old British literature. I would reccomend this book to girls, not necesarily boys. Good luck with your choice!"
1,The most BORING book in the world!,"I am writing this because I just had to read the book as a requirement for English. It is the worst book in the world, and it drags on and on and on. I definitely would not recommend this book for anyone who likes action, mystery, or high paced books. If you want to be bored out of your mind, sure, go ahead and read it. Don't say I didn't warn you! If you ask me, sparknotes are the best thing for this book."
5,Beautiful little book,"I bought this for a friend, and she and I both loved it. It is small but very pretty."
4,"Very good, it is a classic","I had to read this book for summer reading before I started my high school. I am almost frinished it. At first, I was upset that I would have to read it because I thought it would be boring dribble. It honestly wasn't. Sometimes the details make the plot a little blury, but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend anyone who has to read it to read it with an open mind so you can enjoy everything it gives you."
5,"A mature book, hard to understand...but for all ages...","I am twelve years old, and I read this book when I turned eleven. when I finished this book, I sort of re-read some of it, and scanned the pages over, and I said to myself, how in the world did I read this book with pure English language, written years ago, with a totally advanced vocabulary. Yet, yes, this book is at an advanced level, but so many girls between 12-15 read this book. And the funny thing is, that I don't understand the words, but when I read the book, I have a clear view of what the words mean. This is such a great book to give to your kids. I read it like, on my 11th birthday, and it is good for girls 11 and older. I would recomend this book for teens or pre-teens, and parents, don't give them Nancy Drew books. That could ruin them completely. Give them something that can make thier grades go up. They'll thank you later."
5,Jane Eyer,This is a book to read again and again I read it in grade 7 and loved it. In the begining Jane Eyer is a little girl. The book is about her growing up and falling in love with Mr. Rochester. Think everything is happy ever after...?? Think again.
4,A heroine for the ages,"I read ""Jane Eyre"", against my wishes, when I was a junior in high school and found it stuffy and dry, much like other books from the Victorian period. However, when I read it again as a sophomore in college my opinion change. I saw ""Jane Eyre"" as a heroine who fought her way from the bottom of society in order to make something out of herself.What I liked about the title character was that she was smart and even more importantly she was strong-willed. Somehow, Charlotte Bronte created a female heroine who had real character at a time when most women were used solely as ornaments and child-bearing machines."
5,Excellent novel worth reading,"Mixed with Charlotte Bronte's eloquence is a character you actually feel when you read this book. The descriptive characteristics of Jane's surroundings make it easy to imagine what Bronte is trying to portray. Her writing is a work of art in itself. I have read this book over and over again and would highly recommend it to others who want a story about love, fear, pride, hope, sadness, and experiencing life all rolled into one."
3,Bronte gets wordy,"I recently saw the movie Jane Eyre and was tempted to read the book. The movie was beautifully done, but did leave out some very important events that were described in the book. Overall it was a bittersweet love story... A tale of burning down walls figuratively and literally; of allowing ones self to accept truth and love regardless of station; and of knowing ones self above all. Though Bronte does get a bit wordy in her writing (I'm more partial to Emily's writing vs. Charlotte) this is a rewarding story of strength of heart and perseverance of the spirit."
1,Sappy Romance!!!!,"I'm sorry but this was the biggest waste of paper I have ever seen in my life. It is a stupid excuse for a romance novel and I found the long and detailed descriptions of nothing, utterly boring. It is a set text for our school but even our English class couldn't bear to read the whole thing so we skimmed chapter by chapter, gave up and watched the film (which I might add didn't resembled the book at all). I am quite well educated, have a good understanding of the english language and apprieciate good books, but I was appalled at this ridiculous fairy story and I believe it should be taken off schools set text lists."
3,Jane Eyre,"I enjoyed reading this gothic novel. The story takes place in England, during the 19th century. Jane Eyre is orphaned at a young age. Raised in Lowood school, her only friend is Helen She is annoyed by the headmaster Brocklehurst. She is employed as a governess at an estate, where she falls in love with her employer, Rochester. This is a fine example of a coming of age novel."
4,A Classic Gothic Novel,"I read this book as a teenager over 50 years ago and loved it. I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males."
3,Okay In My Opinion,"It was hard for me to love this book because I had trouble relating to Jane Eyre. She was a well rounded character...and every page of her story was vivid and interesting...but I just never really adored her as a character.She is not weak...she's more gentle...strong in character...but gentle...delicate and fierce in character. It's a bit hard to explain...but that's the reason I found it hard to relate.It was also tough because she at 18 yrs is so much like a girl and she falls in love with a man. It's well written...believable and I guess romantic...but it's hard to think of it that way because I never felt for Jane or Mr. Rochester or even some of the background characters enough to be enthralled by their stories.I did like little Adele though (partly because she was French and partly because she always spoke her mind. The author did a great job making her sound like a real kid.So I suggest you try this book, but I'll admit it wasn't my favorite."
3,Jane Eyre,Bought this for my Kindle. I know it's a classic but I just couldn't get into it. I'll prossibly try it again in the future when I finish the other books I have on my Kindle.
4,Monotonous at times,"I first tried to read this book in 3rd grade. I got through 200 pages but couldn't take any more.Now I'm going into 7th grade, and I've actually read it. This book really isn't that reader-friendly, and you have to (really)force yourself through some parts. But the rewards are great. Right after those long, monotonous sequences are over, you'll run into a really unexpected twist in the storyline that will shock you.I can understand why people give this book bad ratings, but in my opinion, the highs are worth the lows."
5,Good read,Saw the movie and wanted to read the book. I bought this for my Kindle and am very happy with it. The story has lots of words that we don't use in our English language anymore. With the Kindle I just bring the curser down to the word I don't know and it gives me the definition. Having the Kindle has made it so much easier to bring more meaning to the story.
5,Don't See the Movie First,"This is a life changing novel. You want to savor every word, all alone, during a rainy weekend. See the movie later so your imagination can do its work."
3,I am only on chapter 9...,"I am only on chapter 9...but it is okay so far. It is an interesting story, but it is also very dark & a bit depressing, and a bit dull at times, I expect it to get better, though:)!"
1,I good movie gone bad,I ordered this and was so disappointed by the quality of the dvd. It is impossible to watch. Don't waste your money.
4,My Hometown,"When this movie was made, I was just 16 but the reason it stayed in my memory is where it was partially filmed. I lived on Reelfoot Lake in northwest Tennessee. The lake was created by an earthquake in 1812 which left many cypress trees still standing in the lake and around it. Many of the outside scenes you see were taken around the lake. I remember when the movie came out, my friends and I were engrossed in finding ""The Raintree"". Hope you enjoy this bit of history."
2,What a total shame,"I have seen this movie many times over the years, and would normally have rated it 5 stars.Being an avid old movie collector, I have looked so forward to having a copy of my own.Well eventually we in South Africa were offered a copy which had to be imported from U.S.A.Excitedly I ordered it.Well of course the movie itself is wonderful and does rate 5 stars. It reflects the complexities of the old south and the civil war admirably. Elizabeth Taylor is incredible as ""Susan"" the tormented heroin who has fears of negro blood in her ancestry. The cinemtography is sweeping and spectaculer - but Oh My - thats where it ends.The copy I received (imported from U.S.A.) has sub-titles that cannot be turned off. They do not always stay true to the dialogue so are distracting and in fact annoying.Surely a better tribute to a great movie and a great actress could have been produced. Raintree County - Elizabeth -I love you, but what a dis-appointment this copy is."
3,Read the book instead,"This movie is not the best and the sets are awful!I would recommend the book though. However, it does have an interesting behind the scenes story. Like, did you know that this was the beginning of the end of Montgomery's career. During the middle of the film he was in a horrible car crash that destroyed his face and took away his gorgeous looks. In which Elizabeth Taylor saved his life. They tried to cover up Montgomery's appearance after the accident but the film suffers."
3,a buried title,MGM does not seem to have much of an interest releasing this title .We therefore have to fall back on an asian bootleg which meanwhile is perfectly all right .Not everything comes out on dvd so we have to wait for an authoritative edition of this film .
5,An excellent one-volume analysis,"Mr. Fromkin takes on a formidable task -- covering an issue of significant complexity, such as the formation of many of the modern nations in the Middle East -- but pulls it off in style. His book achieves a nice blend of factual information (based on a wealth of background research) with fluid prose, making the book as informative as it is easy to read! Having come from that reagion myself, I was nicely suprised to learn new details, yet I was even more excited about Mr. Fromkin's discussion on the British political approach (an ignorance) about the region, which is painted in vivid color through discussions about the major political figures in the landscape. I am hard pressed to find a book on the subject with similar depth and readability, so I highly recommend it!"
1,F - Fail - Disgraceful Scholarship -,"Any Grade 8 student who handed this in would be lectured on proper grammar,footnotes and bibliography.The teacher would give wee Charley a very stern look and say:"" Now Charley Boy - where did you learn history book chapters are 1-4 pages long ? - now I want you to go back and edit this to a 10 page paper because that is all that's here""Grade : F- FailStudent expelled for academic lazinessThe pickings are slim in the Ottoman area but...Try Paris 1919 by Margaret Macmillan"
3,Great idea could be made better,"I agree with other reviews that it could be made better - the partical board material leaves a lot of flakes and could be hazardous to little ones who still put stuff in their mouth. It is definitely a toy for toddlers at least a year old. My son is 14 months and does not fully grasp the idea of putting the pieces back yet, but he likes to throw the pieces around."
5,The best self-massage tool you can buy,"I say the best because it has 11 therapy knobs whereas the closet competitor has far fewer. The Body Back Buddy stimulates in between muscles and pinpoints trigger points for a more finely-tuned treatment. I have numerous aches and pains since I have fibromyalgia plus I workout a good deal. I seem to always be pulling something or messing something up that causes a good deal of pain. And, in most cases, it's where I can't reach. This massage tool helps me greatly. It's especially helpful for the neck and back but also works trigger points on the feet, hips and other places.Overall length is 25 inches. Comes with a free 12 page instruction booklet. There are also instructions on their website. And there's a manual you can download. Basically, you simply put a knob or knobs on the sore area and massage. The relief you'll feel is amazing.Highly recommended.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
3,Pretty good- strange shipping and it is plastic!,"It seems pretty good thus far, it can really get some knots but not others.I was so shocked to see it was shipped unwrapped/padded in a huge manilla envelope! yes a paper envelope! It was mostly out of the package when it came to my house- I was annoyed that it was scratched and dragged along who knows where!The 2nd disappointment is that it is plastic- seems fairly strong, but I expected better quality."
2,Not bad. Not amazing.,"This item does as it says ok. I wouldn't say it saved by back or is as good as other tools that I've tried.It is sturdy and applies nice/decent pressure to pressure points. It's not very good for rolling pressure/""massage"". It's shape is a bit awkward for some-- it depends on your size and back height, I suppose. Overall, it's an ok/fine item.. but not a miracle worker. It's a bit tiring and tedious to hit the right pressure points with it. I wouldn't buy it again for my purposes, but the item itself seems to last ok. Just too awkward to use, not relaxing, and can't hit the right spots on me."
4,Works as Advertised,"This funny looking apparatus does work. It will reach the trigger points in your back and there is no doubt when you hit them. To use it properly you need to also get a book on Trigger Point Therapy. I have the one by Clair Davies and while technical,it tells you what you need to do. I also have the small theracane but it can't compare to what this unit can do. Overall it is well worth the price at half the cost of one massage."
5,Excellent Product,It will only take 2 words to sum up this product: LOVE it! My massage therapist recommended it and I bought it the same day. I only wish I would have heard about it sooner ;)
2,Not the best for fibromyalgia or myofascial pain,"The problem for me with the cane is that I have fibromyalgia/myofascial pain syndrome and when I use my muscles they tighten up and stay that way. It hurts and restricts my movement. So, when I use the cane I am holding it and applying pressure to the knots in another part of my body, all the time working the arm, shoulder and neck muscles, causing more problems in THOSE muscles. If you are normal, I think the cane would be great. I prefer the Knobble or just a rubber ball."
2,To sharp,The pointed edges are too sharp. This thing didn't help my back pain at all. The pointed edges hurt. I would not buy again
3,No instruction sheet :-(,"I love the IDEA of this thing, but in practice it needs some improvement. For one thing, an instructional booklet would be nice, to help with placement of the various knob ends. And perhaps also a warning that you might not want to press very hard when you're just starting to use it: I ended up with bruises and a sore back after my first use. I'm not giving up, though; it definitely helps put pressure on some of those trigger points that I can't reach on my own - and focuses the pressure on the places I can reach."
5,Great tension relief,I am really happy with the purchase. It's a great way on applying pin point pressure with the strength and accuracy that only you and your body feel is right. I think it's a nice tool to have along with stretching.
5,Awesome,"This item compares to the Thericane brand of trigger point tools. But, it has more nodes and different shapes. We actually like it more than the thericane."
2,I Like Thera Cane Better!,I use a Thera Cane at work alot. I work in a dental offcie and so my back is full of knots :(.What I don't like about the back buddy is it's handle.It's square. It's uncomfortable to use. I should of returned it and got a back buddy.
1,Most Useless Product I Have Ever Ordered,"I can't even begin to tell you how useless this product is. It feel like it was made by a child. It doesn't release tension but rather only causes it. I have read the ""manual"" which is actually a 4 page book with crappy pictures and I have also read different methods on the internet. In the end, I wish I had never purchased this trash. It pretty much hangs as a prop in my closet."
5,"fantastic, beats the theracane","Wonderful tool, it's like the next generation leap from the theracane. I have weak arms and hands and find the theracane difficult to grip and maneuver (have had it for at least 15 yrs. The Body Back Buddy has a flat surface to hold on to and it is much easier to grip as a result, is extremely lightweight but not at all flimsy. The knobs are well positioned and the pointy knobs are a great tool to have as well. This thing is awesome! I'm coming back for the mini to bring it to work!"
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I have been an avid gym rat for 20 years and participate in many sporting activities. I frequently get knots in my neck and back and have to make appointments to the chiropractor on a regular basis. Not only is it an inconvenience during a busy workday, but the health insurance co-pay does add up. As soon as i heard of the Body Back Buddy, i had to buy and try it. I IMMEDIATELY felt a release in the knots and pressure built up in my back and neck and use it on a daily basis whether i need it or not. It is a an instant relief for any muscle knotting and stiff back and when you don't have a spare set of hands to use, the Body Back Buddy is a savior!"
5,Reliever of sore pressure points.,"For a do-it-yourself job, this instrument does a fine job. It greatly helps to relieve sore pressure points and tight spots. There are limitations when working on myself -- I'm using my own muscles to operate this tool, so I can't relax the same as if I was having a massage or physical therapist work on me. So after considering the limitations of a self-applied tension reducer, this works fine. I have one at home and another one at my office -- I use one or both of them almost daily."
3,Smaller than I thought,"Good quality and all but it is much smaller than I anticipated. It can only fit the smallest of envelopes. Medium or larger envelopes, coupons, Netflix will not fit rendering it pretty much useless for our situation. I will take some of the blame for not researching further. Heed the warnings, IT IS SMALL."
3,Too Small,"Although it fits a regular sized bill/letter, it does not fit most of the mail I get. Therefore, I am having to return it. Bummer."
2,Small and No Hooks,"The picture is deceiving. I should have read the description better though, as it is smaller than I anticipated. I haven't tried, but I doubt it would even fit a large birthday card. I would have just lived with this being my oversight, but it does not even have the hooks for keys. So, I am returning this product. I am very sad because I had been looking for something like(what I thought) this (was) for a while."
1,too small to be useful!,"If you need a holder for a couple envelops then this MIGHT work, but it's TINY. I should have paid much more attention to the dimensions."
5,GREAT summary and all encompassing view of rotations/residency for psych,"has everything you need to know in a conscise, to the point format. It has epi, clinical sx, DSMIV criteria, tx, and has a section dedicated to MOA, Side effects of drugs!"
5,AMAZING,Probably one of my favorite Disney films. It came in great condition and I've probably almost worn it out from watching it so much. I am very pleased with the transaction.
3,Slow,"Had a hard time paying attention at first to this movie, bought for my kids 8 and 6 years old. Made it to the latter part of the movie and it seemed to come together but my kids seemed to have lost interest LONG before that......because of the end I actually liked it."
3,Some touching scenes + Too serious. Not as funny as other cartoons = Worth renting.,"This movie has some touching scenes. For example, the scene in the orphanage where Lewis tried hard showing off his invention hoping to be adopted but he failed.Most of the time it's too serious. It's not as funny as others. When I watch cartoons, I look for humor. I don't mind if it's silly but it must be funny. That's why I love Bugs Bunny, Mulan, Jungle book, etc.As for graphic, this film looks good but not as good as Pixar.It's worth renting."
3,Meet the Robinsons,"This movie had its moments, but was not as good as it was hyped in previews. Average with a few shining moments, but not enough to make it a must see."
5,This is one I'm going to add to my collection.,"I've been really disappointed with the quality of animated movies that have been out today. With films like ""Open Season"" and ""Flushed Away"" becoming increasingly popular, it's hard to find a good, plot and character driven family film- without the dirty, gross-out humor and innuendo which plagues so many movies today.The plot is simple, and starts off reminding me *loosely* of the movie Annie. The movie continues on rather fast, and some parts were predictable (Maybe because I was thinking about all of the ""What if's"".I saw this with a friend of mine (She's 14 I'm 16) and we both adored it.Although- during part with ""Doris"" I could just *hear* the Sephiroth theme music playing in the background (as could she).A very endearing movie, great characters, plot, and animation to boot! My time was well spent! I'm buying this one for sure!"
1,Screwed up mess of a movie,"I can't recall the last time I gave up on a movie ... I usually will suffer through anything just to get to the end. But I had to stop halfway through this.The ""official"" review says it gives a fresh perpective on what the future may look like, or some such nonsense. Give me a break.Good for kids? Whatever the producers were aiming at, I didn't get it, and I doubt my adopted 4 or 6 year old daughters would either. They would get the early scene about the main character's despair over ever being adopted, then they would have quickly lost interest in the confusing dialog that follows for the next 45 minutes and simply have been left with a very negative message about adoption.If I could give this a zero, I would."
3,"""We Are One Smart Kid""","Disney's 'Meet the Robinson' is a fast paced at times adorable tale of one highly intelligent boy's search for a loving family to call his own.The production values are superior, the storyline well thought out and the action intense. However with that said I must also say it seems to be lacking that nebulous quality that has always made Disney, well Disney.When you think of the long line of past Disney classics there is always something that stands out; a character, a particular scene, or perhaps a song that stays with you forever. I don't find that to be the case with this film.My Rating: The film is enjoyable but, aspects of the storyline may be too complicated for younger children. Bottom line, 'Meet the Robinsons' will not command the kind of cult following that Disney movies are known for and it's definitely not destined to be listed amongst the studios great classics; -3 1/2 Stars-."
4,Cat's,Was a pretty good family movie. Had a good story (don't like to go into detail. Don't want to ruin it for others). Very good visual affects.I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Loved it!,I am a Bette Davis fan to the core. This was an excellent movie. It is a suspenseful movie and with a surprise ending. Watching Bette Davis play both roles as two sisters was amazing. I loved every minute of it.
3,TWINS BEWARE,"If you are a twin sister, you'll never look at your sister again the same way. Wicked and ""Twilight Zone"" ironic, but not as scary as ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"".Worth a view on a rainy day."
2,You really can't cast Peter Lawford,"as a straight Peter Lawford. He was as gay in 1945 as he is here, lo those many years later. He's certainly not the sort of lothario/protagonist that could ever set any woman's wheels in motion.Davis, after ""Baby Jane"" and ""Hush, Hush"" looks, deservedly so, exhausted. Like she doesn't even want to be a part of this mess, though she gives it her best shot. She's a mess, he's a mess, everyones a mess mess. But here they are, throwing the mess in our faces and, as far as Davis is concerned, down our throat.For Davis, it's not a bad turn. She's okay. She rises above the decidely Grade B material with aplomb. Her twin sister act, while not convincing, is enjoyable to watch.But an exhausted Bette Davis has a tendency to exhaust the viewer. Toss in Peter Lawford and it bcomes a defintion of ""yawn"". He can't act and she's trying her best, at this stage of the game. TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!! She's twins, you know.Silly fare, but for Davis fans, well, it's Davis."
4,Nice Fred Wesley / JB Soundtrack Collaboration,"Issac Hayes had SHAFT, Curtis had SUPERFLY, Edwin Starr got HELL UP IN HARLEM, JB got BLACK CEASAR (Hell Up In Harlem, Pt. 1) and Slaughter's Big Rip Off.If you like Fred Wesley and The JBs and James Brown's albums circa THE PAYBACK this album is a must have. The film ain't too bad either (if you're into Black Action films). Brother Rapp, the Jazzy Transmogripfication prominantly featuring Fred Wesley and People Get Up And Drive Your Funky soul are JB classics ! Lyn Collins ""The Female Preacher"" (of ""It Takes Two To Make A Thing Go Right"" fame) is also in it.Check out the James Brown's FUNKY PEOPLE (1, 2 and 3) series if you like this stuff ! Also check out REALITY and HELL, two other classic JB albums of that particular era, plus FRED WESLEY AND THE J.B.'s Breakin' Bread !"
2,Could be better,"It seems that most introductory R books spend too much time with correlations and other modeling. I am still hoping to find an R book that deals primarily with data manipulation and descriptive graphics at an intro to intermediate level. Simply put, knowing something well and conveying it properly to your audience are often mutually exclusive."
3,What happened to Gustaf Tenggren's Illustrations?!,"I was really looking forward to Little Golden Books' updated version of Bannerman's classic story, but I must agree that the illustrations were quite disappointing. The updated story (and title) are fine, but instead of using the exquisite artwork originally used in Golden Books' original version by Gustaf Tenggren (an illustator whose work still appears in countless reprintings of the ""The Poky Little Puppy (A Little Golden Book Classic)"" and the ""The Saggy Baggy Elephant (Little Golden Book)"", among others), the publisher chose new illustrations by someone else, and they were not as captivating. For a better rendition of this classic story with great illustrations, I would recommend instead Fred Marcellino's ""The Story of Little Babaji""."
4,Hard to keep from laughing,"Lillian Oglethorpe's husband dies, leaving a large sum of money to the creation of a ballet company. When Lillian expresses her adoration of ballet legend Roberto Volare (George De La Pena), two attorneys (John Turturro and John Savident) will stop at nothing to beat each other in signing him to dance for the Oglethorpe company.This is another great one from Pat Proft, writer of the Naked Gun series. Although the direction is pretty good, it is the acting and the writing that make the film so good. John Turturro, Mel Smith, and Bob Nelson are all very good, and it is hard to keep from laughing through the whole picture."
5,Comedic Euphroia,"Goodness me! Not real humor such as Austin Powers? Blasphemy! Brain Donors, Top Secret and PCU are the worlds greatest movies. The way comedy should be."
3,Nice but you get what you pay for,"The Buffet server makes an attractive presentation. The candle warmers made it easy to keep food warm. I'm not sure how long the good looks will last though. For example, some edge finishes are basic to lower the cost. The buffet dish is OK. But the base piece that holds the candles isn't very high quality. For the price, it did what I wanted which was give my party some class without spending a ton for pieces I'll need once in a while."
3,Don't Like the Layout of this Edition,"No footnotes. The book is not even printed until after being ordered. The book itself is great, but this format and edition is not nice."
5,An exhilarating read!,"A simply fascinating piece of literature. This is the type of book that you will find yourself putting down to ponder what you just read time after time. I can't say that I agree with every point that Mr. Chesterton raises, but, reading Chesterton is exhilarating."
3,Good but Hard to Follow,"I love the Christian classics and have read many of them throughout the years. ""Orthodoxy"" is a well written book, and Chestertons style will appeal to many, but ultimately I found the book somewhat wordy and hard to follow. I much prefer ""Mere Christianity"" by C.S. Lewis."
5,A Masterpiece,"I feel sort of silly trying to review a book by Chesterton so I'll just say this: I have read this book twice. The first time I read it I was so disappointed in it that I became angry for having wasted my time. To my eventual benefit I wrote scathing remarks in the margins of each page.A decade later I picked it up again and that's when things got weird. As I read it a second time I got the distinct impression that I was reading a vastly different book. Had the contents magically changed? My scathing margin notes remained the same, however, and I could vaguely discern which passages from Chesterton they were allegedly referring to. I could even, with the help of my notes, reconstruct what I had once thought Chesterton was ""hopelessly trying to say."" Since my second reading I have come to regard it as one of my favorite writings. This is truly a masterpiece written by one of the most gifted and imaginative minds we've produced."
5,A must read for anyone trying to understand the world today!,"One of the most important books written, brilliant in scope and understanding of faith.There are many better reviews here than I can write, I just wanted to add my 5 stars, if I could give it 10 I world!"
3,Long enough but not cute.,Comfy pants good for working out but if you want cute pants that slightly hug your body these dont do that. They are plain black cotton pants. Over priced for their quality and design.
4,Pretty nice,"Makes things bigger, lets in light. would be 5 stars if it was glass instead of plastic but it would also probably be more expensive. very satisfying, great for looking at aerial photos."
1,Does not work with 35mm negatives,I bought this item intending to use it to view my old 35mm negatives while assembling them in some negative holders. Either I am doing something wrong or this device was never intended to use to view photo negatives. I cannot see any detail on the negatives. I thought I would be able to place a strip of negatives under the glass and be able to see an enlarged view of the negative. The only way this might work is if some type of bright back light was used under the negative.
4,Great gardening book for the Pacific NW,"Love the book! The size, information, photos, and recommendations are perfect for the small space gardener. I live in Seattle and the local author provides lots of practical ideas for urban gardening in the Pacific NW. As many gardening books I have on the bookcase, I often find myself referring to this whenever I need some inspiration."
1,simply rubbish,"I purchased this stand based on 2 positive reviews from buyers prior to me and boy do I regret it.first of all its cost me at least $200 us to have it in hand and when it finally arrived it look much bigger than I had hope for since it was advertised as a small mixer stand. my 8 channel mixer was way too small to even stay on the satnd so I decided to use it for my laptop with my duo.because of the way the stand was constructed,it leaned on a side and after just three uses the screw that fastens the bottom broke in the head and the stand just spins all around likr these office chairs that the base resembles... Overall I'm very disappointed and will not recomend this to anyone ever!! Furthure more customers should stop reviewing products the same day it arrives to avoid decieving others...."
2,Zucchero should NEVER sing in English,"Zucchero IS the primary rock-pop-blues talent of Italy. This album DOES contain the magnificent duet w/Pavarotti (co-written by U2's Bono). And it does have a lot of fun and a lot of great melodies. That being said, Zucchero's translators have done nothing but BUTCHER his haunting lyrics when turning them into something vaguely resembling English words, and when he sings a song exclusively in English, he sounds--well, like an Italian man singing in English. Buy the Italian (or Spanish!) versions of his work instead--and the more recent, the better!"
4,The autobiography of an ex-coloured man,Would recommend this book to a lot of people as it describes how hard it was for 1/2 cast coloured men had to cope with a lot of problems in America.
3,Grand finale...not,"I think the ending of this book ruined it for me. I enjoyed the middle a lot and didn't want to put it down, but I feel the ending just contradicted everything in the worst way."
2,Drags.,"This is one of the worst books I read in the past year. If it weren't for its place in history and its importance as the first first-person book written by an African-American author, I probably would've given it one star. The narrative style is painful, the plot feels meandering and silly, and it's just plain not worth reading. The narrator's ""earnest"" style starts to grate after about 30 pages, and from there on the book just goes bonking along to nowhere. The ending is terrible, as well."
4,Interesting and informational!,I found this book to be a great read. The story was told from a perspective that draws the reader in and makes them hope for a good outcome for the character. The portrayal of the way black people were treated during the time setting of the book was insightful and poignant. I recommend this book.
4,Super easy to use and compatible with Vista and Windows XP!,"I wanted a memory stick that would be easy to use and compatible with our new Dell XPS system (vista software) AND our old Windows XP software. It works with both and there is nothing you have to know to use it. SIMPLE. The added bonus is the connected top, so there is no losing it or damaging the USB connection. Also has a cord for hanging it around your neck, allowing a high-schooler easy access and less chance of loss."
2,Corny cliche,I sure don't understand the 32 five star ratings that prompted me to purchase this book. I thought the writing was corny and the story line cliche. It was a quick 2 hour read but I want more from my books than a quick read- otherwise I would watch a movie.
1,Can a book be any duller?,"Abby, the successful engineer returns back to her hometown after 10 years where she meets Chase the former high school hottie. He has a big secret which we find out is the fact that he is illiterate... Their differences in education don't seem to matter, they still get together and plan to spend their future as a married couple, endless rambling on about it later I wish I had not wasted my time on this book."
5,Beautifully colored,"I use the Universal deck in my professional work, but I love the coloring of this deck for personal use. It's strong and evocative, but in a quality way, not loud or garish."
3,"Highlights the flaws, and graces, of Wes Montgomery.","The title track is an arrangement of the famous Beatles song, and is a bizarre folly: in an attempt to create a jazz-blues Concerto de Aranjuez, Wes's evocative guitar is drowned in an abrasive orchestral scree. this drowning continues throughout, if less abrasively - each intricate solo overlaid with swathes of kitsch muzak. Montgomery's lack of elitism is to be applauded, and we should be grateful for his sensitive adaptations of 'When a man loves a woman' and 'Eleanor Rigby', but the best tracks here, like a breezy 'Windy' or 'Angel', are those where his melodic gift is channelled through, rather than in spite of, his guitar."
1,Not his best,"I have to agree w/ those who find some fault with this recording. I was expecting much more in the way of ""Full House"" by Wes... true jazz guitar, lots of original tunes, etc. This album is OK, but it is cheesy.. .. strings, overly orchestral arrangements, etc. If it's a childhood favorite that's one thing but don't go in expecting great jazz. These tracks are almost all covers, inclulding Beatles tunes and pop hits like Windy."
3,Do not buy in place of 23rd edition!,"I bought this textbook for a Mineralogy course at a university. I was told the 22nd edition would suffice since I could not afford the 23rd edition. For those of you who are in the same boat and trying to cut corners, dont buy this book! I am not commenting on the quality of the book at all, I'm sure it is an excellent textbook. I am just warning those who expect to follow along in a class using the next edition. Its not just a matter of different page numbers or chapters, there is whole chapters missing. If you need the 23rd edition and are in a pinch, rent it from [...]"
2,Outdated and obvious,I must admit this book was a BIG surprise to me - in the negative way. It felt outdated and boring - as opposed to the fresh thinking I was expecting.Sorry to say - but read CK instead - their supply ideas are WAY better!
1,returned my copy,"I am surprised O'REILLY published such a weak book. To keep it short, it is one of those ""click here, click there, you are done!"" kind of books. I doesn't go much deeper than the Cocoa tutorials on Apple's developer site."
1,Poorly written rehash of publicly available materials,Learning Cocoa is a a poorly ogranized rehash of materials that are freely offered by Apple Computer's website. The books is deplorably structured. The chapter explaining Objective-C is confusing and incomplete. They don't show any meaningful code until the Currency Converter example. This is the exact emample that can be found in Apple's online developer documentation. This book is only helpful as a printed reference to Apple's online materials.
3,Not a good revision,"The older revision of this backpack was a definite 5 out of 5; this one, not so much. Differences include:- The older version was bigger - the main book pouch was much larger (essential for any serious college student), and the side pouches were also larger (essential for carrying anything larger than an aspirin tablet in them).- The Targus symbol on the front of the bag was a headphone jack pass-through, and was designed in such a way as to not let water in. The pass-through in the new version is just an X cut in a piece of rubber. Not good if you keep electronics in that pouch.- There are other, smaller differences, such as a longer handle at the top of the bag (tougher to put the bag on a desk, esp. if you're short) and the zippers running different ways (affects water resistance).The new revision is still a great bag (I gave one to my fiancee) but it can't hold a candle to the older model of the same name, especially if you pack a lot of stuff in it."
5,Fully functional Targus,I needed a back pack with space for everything and that's what I got. I like the simplicity of this bag.
2,Good School Bag Not A Great Travel Bag.,"I bought this bag for traveling. It is not very comfortable, the shoulder straps feel like they are filled with packing paper, and compared to similar priced bags the material is cheap. It looks great and has plenty of storage. I was replacing a 5 year old Targus Port Bag. Due to the edition of roller gear on the new port bags I decided to go with another bag. For my needs, I should have gone with a different company. Also to note is that the storage is great however, a fully packed bag will not fit in the over head bin of a smaller jet airliner."
1,Bookbag,I received this item torn and the seller didnt cover as much as they should for shipping(return). I would NOT order from them ever again
2,color,"The color is very off, looks like it has white on it ,does not. And the grey looks green. Very frustrated with it but space is good in it. Just was really looking forward to white on it."
4,Big Bag,I go to school part time and I bought this to carry books and laptop when I go to school. This bag has a lot of room. So far it is holding the weight well. I only use it once a week. I use a different carrying case for daily use since I don't have to carry so much of stuff. This is a nice travel bag. I will not like to use it daily unless I have so much stuff to carry every day.
5,Mirror Dinghies will never be the same again!,"A beautifully written book - but then you would expect that from an English teacher! Full of hilarious escapades, frightening experiences and gloriously colourful accounts of this unbelieveably exciting yet delightful journey! Should be on the bookshelf of every Mirror Dinghy owner, and the reading list of every school! With its broad appeal this book makes an excellent gift. I look forward to the author's next publication - which I have no doubt will be forthcoming in due course as a result of world demand!"
2,"Pretty good, but pretty short too...","I like this book but would rather have just read these rants online. And why does it say Thom Yorke is one of the writers? Does he go by another name? That bummed me out a little. I wish more comedians would have been involved, it was way too short. Phooey!"
1,Too difficult to read,As with a lot of the wrox press books ; they are incredibly difficult to read; both literally and physically!!!;you can't keep a page open because the book spine is so tight that it keeps flipping shut.The book should start at the beginning and work its way through but instead it jumps into the deepend drowning newer users.Really found this book annoying and although it has a lot of content and usefull code the format and delivery make it ultimately a waste of money (my opinion.)
1,THIS IS NOT A TRAGEDY,"The author tells story of one of children who made the choice to not have faith in Christianity. That's it! That's all! Nobody starved and certainly nobody died. Yet the author insists painting her son's choice as the tragedy to en all tragedies. Last time I checked we as individuals in our society are not only supposed to have the right to think for ourselves but this most basic and precous liberty is supposed to be actively encouraged. Obviously this is a completely alien concept to this author. Before this author contemplated writting this book perhaps sho should have gone to a place where REAL tragedy is going on as a daily basis, such as mass hunger,war, or gencide. Where children die everday. How dare she even think of feeling sorry for herself."
3,Mistaken Identity,Mistook this item for an update edition of the American College of Physicians COMPLETE HOME MEDICAL GUIDE (1999). Frankly the Home Medical Guide is superior in every way in spite of its having been published 15 years ago.
3,AMA Ref Book,"With the AMA as the source for the content I had confidence that the medical info was current and most reliable and I would give this book a 5 for content, also a 5 for the reasonable price. However I was disappointed that it had so few colored illustrations, was divided up into chapters devoted to disease categories or age of patient, was not ""thumb indexed"" to enable quick access alphabetically, and lastly I could not find a date for the most recent year this material had been updated."
5,Medical Encyclopedia,"This AMA medical guide is a treasure trove of useful information. It discusses illnesses and diseases, giving symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of each. Also has a glossary of drugs and common medical terms. Very good index. No home should be without it."
1,worst record of the 20th century,This CD could be the worst record of all time-I think it is a shame that so many WOMEN get recording contracts because they are pretty-I think something has been stinking in the record business for a long time-why doesn't someone SCREAM at how great someone like Mary Lou Lord is????
5,Toner,"In my office we go through cartridges on a fairly regular basis. The Xerox toner is one of my ""go to"" items...I'm extremely happy with the product!"
5,Amazing reading,"This is a fantastic book about the St. Johns River in Florida. Many people see this river every day but few people experience the river the way the author did. To read this book is to undertake a journey down the St. Johns as people did in the 1800's, from the headwaters to the mouth and all points between. After reading this book I realized what I was missing and determined to go back and really see the river again for the first time. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates what is left of the true Florida or who is even the slightest bit interested in the real world. The author's style is casual but compelling and you may have a hard time putting it down except to rush out, load the canoe, and head to the river! A must have book for anyone who lives near the river, nature lover or not."
5,A Stunning Masterpiece!,"Any Garland fan who hasn't seen this is in for a treat. The performances and musical numbers alone are mesmerizing, but the outstanding stereo audio and wide-screen presentation are second only to Judy Garland in making this film one of the all-time best. The included 'extras' are a wonderful added bonus."
2,Why watch this when you can watch the '37 version?,"I generally dislike remakes and this was no exception. I felt that any seriousness the story had was scattered abroad like dandelion fuzz at the hand of the continual musical breeze. I would not care to ever watch this again.My two stars go entirely to James Mason, who did a very good job here in amongst the melodious maelstrom. I though the scene when he proposed to Esther was quite clever, and probably the only thing really memorable about this poor excuse of a remake. Judy Garland was simply too old for the part and lacked the fresh youthful enthusiasm of Janet Gaynor in the '37 version, which you should see by all means rather than this one, because it is far superior in all ways."
1,What a WASTE-Save your money.,The book was a waste of money. You can get a CD called Axapta Multi-Media LXCD-MM00-D000000 10/3 from your local Axapta provider that tells the same story. This book is so basic and has no meat to it. I wish I'd have waited for other reviews before I purchased it. My bad. Call a local Axpata provider and get the info for FREE.
1,not enough,It looks like a microsfot brochure for the people who have no odea about Axapta. it is giving some basic knowledge for beginniners.
5,No child should grow up without Lang and Ford!,"The colored fairy tale books by Andrew Lang include stories from around the world. This is no exception--it even contains 3 Native American stories and 3 from Iceland! Others come from Hungary, Poland, Russia, Germany, France and England. The illustrations by H. J. Ford in each of the colored fairy tale books by Lang are marvelous creations in black ink. Dover books can get colored pictures wrong, but for black and white illustrations they are great. Don't miss the whole series--start with the Blue book."
5,AWESOME!,"This DVD really blew me away! The locations, scenery, cinematography, and of course the beauty of the subject all were breathtaking! I enjoied the music and most of all the different way the program was shot and put together. It kept my interest sparked and I would recommend this program to anyone looking for an innovative change of pace from the cookie cutter type program we see so much of these days. Way to go!"
1,Very judgemental,"The author has some great pages, but he is so judgmental. If you don't believe what he believes he put you down. Sorry I bought the book. I wish he would have done what title says and that's is to teach on a different word not put everything down he doesn't believe in. Stay away unless you believe in knocking other works."
5,good book:),this book was good with a strong plot and descriptive characters took me a day to great awsome quick read
3,"Interesting, but more memoir than guidebook","When I purchased the book I was in the process of planning for a 6 week sabbatical. The book desctiprion sounded perfect. I'm Type A, and the author is a self-described Type A as well so I figured it would be a good fit. I definately found the book interesting, but it was more of a post-reflection memoir including stories from women she met. I was looking for something to match my type A personality that was more list-like. Action planning, etc. Now that I'm one week into my sabbatical, I can understand how quickly you move from list-girl to trying to tap into your emotions (since I neglect them in my working life). I've decided to blog about my experience of taking six weeks off as well if you're interested. [...]"
1,these are double dobby stripes,nowhere in the description does it say that these sheets are dobby striped. i was looking for solid white sheets. another disappointment!
2,"Not a ""how to"" book.","The title implies that this is a book about how to start a business with no cash. Nothing could be be further from the truth. Yes, the author did start many businesses with little or no cash however this book is in no way a road map as to how the reader can apply the author's methodology on a regular, consistant basis. Each of the author's ventures are truly unique to time, place and circumstance.If you're looking for a good story book about the adventures, trials and tribulations of a confirmed self-employed individual, then this is an interesting read.In the meantime, don't quit your day job until you find another book."
2,A Frightening Look Behind The Curtain,"Wow. This guy left a wake of bankrupt investors, angry customers & employees (and all for good reason), everywhere he went!He frequently spends money he hasn't earned and creatively parlays it until the house of cards collapses. And this happends over and over again.Somehow, out of decades of disasters..., a business emerges that he sells for a lot of money.What I took away from the book is that Terry has more business experiences than nearly anybody - but he still hasn't learned anything from it!He got lucky 1 time out of 50 and wrote a book.I finished the book still looking for the ""invaluable lessons"", but gave it 2 starts because it is an engaging read."
4,Age appropriate words and activities,"I bought this product to help a child I am tutoring develop his vocabulary. There are 25 sets of 10 words with 3 pages of excercises for each set. So far, I've been using one set a week, while asking his parents to reinforce the use of the words at home, and it has been helpful. My one criticism is that the words don't relate to each other at all. They seem to be pulled out of a hat. It might make the study of them more interesting if they were based on a broad theme, but I do like the level of the chosen words."
3,"Too broad, too shallow","To be fair, I didn't read this book thoroughly. I bought it, used it for a few nights, then returned it. I wanted a book that would treat subjects in depth. This book had a bunch of chapter headings with the word ""Advanced"" in the title on subjects I was interested in, so I bought it. But the content, for my purposes, was lacking.I think this book provides a good overview of the various Java technologies, however. It just didn't go deep enough for my needs."
4,Scanner is probably ok,"I read good reviews of this scanner, but It didnt work for my needs. I need to scan somewhat narrow barcodes in rows. This scanner provides only one giant red block probably for bigger single barcode items."
2,Don't believe the Hype,"I bought this movie after watching the previews on another movie. I am an action junkie; and this movie looked like tons of action. It was not. They must have shown all of the action scenes in the preview. This movie is VERY LONG, VERY SLOW, BORING, with a very disappointing ending. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
5,Perfect slides,The slides are perfect! I could not get them at Home Depot or Lowes. Price was spot on also.Good quality too.
4,"Nice vocals, catchy rifts, pleasant melodies and variety...","Nice vocals, catchy rifts, pleasant melodies and variety are all over this album. I ran across it while preparing for a radio show I do in Cincinnati, Ohio. The group broke up in 1993, and even if the tunes are a bit dated in style, they are all still excellent. Lots of different styles with excelent vocals and playing throughout the entire album. Two of the origional members are back together and playing. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!"
3,"interesting, relaxing","Nice book - describing her childhood. All readers should bear in their minds, though, that Morocco is not like that anymore. This is a story from her past."
5,Very funny!!,This book is very entertaining! It is about a poor person who finds clever ways to get his basic needs met. This book is a good read for young readers like me!!!
3,"Good, BUT","This is a good book BUT it is not perfect. For one, it is way too hard for a beginner. Don't even bother if you're a beginner. Second, it's an oldstyle book too, with a whole chapter on SLIP, IPX, and UUCP, and stressing ipfwdmn (whatever it's spelled) over ipchains. and leaving out stuff like Samba and Xwindows (!!). I don't think Perl is mentioned once.But it does have some good stuff. The chapters on firewalling are good, as is the beginning. There is a good overview of sendmail and news which you don't always find. The chapters on DNS, NIS, name servers, and NFS are fine. So it's a good reference to have, but you don't want it to be the only book you have."
4,Networked yourself,One of first book about TCP/IP services configuration. I really found that this book really usefull. However this book only suitable for beginners.
4,An eye opener,"This is a great book if you want to understand the dynamics of how/why societies of different types are formed and why they collapse.At the same time, it's a bit of an eye opener to understand what makes a society (or an organization) ""tick"".The book is on the academic side, but if you stick with it you'll learn a lot."
2,Complex of complex societies,"Lengthy, verbose, repetitious a real head nodder. I more or less gave up on the book after going through the same ritual with every society he wrote about.Unless you are a real study of Archaeology, of of Doomsday predictions, would not recommend this book."
1,a clever disguise,"of Messrs Thiel and Sacks. The morality of ""I've got mine so screw you"" masquerading as discourse against diversity. A clever bunch, these people are, but they fool nobody. That shills like William Kristol support it should be your clue."
4,"Must read in order, first to last","No doubt I love to read Thomas because I have a background and experience similar to hers; however, I recommend the stories be read in order, first to last. I don't think you can really understand Thomas if the stories are read randomly. The title makes the book sound like a collection of short stories that can be read separately, but I found that is not the case."
5,Brideshead - worth revisiting,"I found a recommendation for this book on Fr. Robert Barrone's ""Word on Fire"" blog. I had avoided it because I thought the TV series was enough, but the book is infinitely more subtle and detailed. Also, Waugh takes every opportunity to embellish the narrative with his dry, slightly cynical wit. I will definitely re-read this at some point. It is certainly heavier and more serious than any of his other books that I have read, but the characterization alone makes it engrossing."
5,Brideshead Revisited,"Classic English Historical Fiction. A glimpse into the eccentricities of the former English aristocratic lives. See the PBS mini series too, but the movie currently out doesn't do the book justice like the mini-series."
1,Don't buy abridged editions of literature.,"This is not the only abridged edition of a literary work Amazon is offering without any warning at all that it's abridged. If Kindle books are to be acceptable to serious readers, full disclosure is a must.Moreover, Amazon is accepting for distribution ""Kindle"" versions of books that are so shabbily scanned that the errors interrupt the reading flow. In most cases one can see how machine scanning could cause the error; what's not acceptable is that no editor has gone through the product with a fine-tooth comb before putting it out there.Don't buy them when warned, return them when surprised, and call them out by name - identifying publisher if possible."
2,Didn't finish it,"I average two books a week, and have given up on approximately a dozen books in my lifetime. This book started off with an interesting concept, and got progressively more boring and more self indulgent, I deleted the book about a quarter of the way through. Who knows if it got better? The process wasn't worth the suffering."
2,Bridesheads Revisited,"Interesting read, not really sure what I expected. Tended to be a bit ponderous. Still, it was a nice change from the usual modern story I often pick up"
5,"Poetic, profound, moving","Brideshead Revisited is a deeply moving book with sections that are better classified as poetry than prose -- from the opening sequence of Charles Ryder looking back at Brideshead and his past, comparing his falling out of love with the army to a man who has fallen out of love with his wife; to the scene where Charles and Julia crash against the wall aboard the windswept ship, her body pressed against his as he gazes out at the starry sky through her long hair against his face.But even more than the poetry of this book and the beautiful descriptions of Oxford and the time in which it is set (interwar Britain), it is the slowly unfolding tragedy of the book that makes it so appealing and moving. That, and the gradual but inexorable process of Charles' journey into maturity and the recognition that there is more to life than he had first realised. Definitely one of my favourite books of all time."
2,The SLOWEST read I've had in a long time! Boring!,I usually read a book in one or two nights after dinner. I've been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down. It is just a SLOW read; certainly doesn't have anything in it to hold my interest.I'm a person that refuses to give up (except for a few that I filed in a Mistakes folder) on my kindle. I think I'm up to 62% read now and will probably force myself to finish it but it will definitely get put into the mistakes folder.In other words --- it's just plain BORING!
4,Beautiful Language and an Intriguing Story,"Although Brideshead Revisted starts out a little dry, this novel's beautiful language and syntax will definitely keep the book in your hands. The story is about a young man, Charles Ryder, and his relationships with the Flyte family. Sebastian Flyte, the younger brother, is Charles' best friend throughout his college days. Sebastian has a whole family full of characters that challenge Charles to re-evaluate his opinions on everything from religion to relationships. I don't think my words can do justice, though, to the words of Evelyn Waugh, his writing is masterful, and I believe you will thoroughly enjoy reading this book."
4,"A vivid look into a world gone by, but despicable characters","I listened to the audio of this book after having seen the PBS mini-series years ago and I was amazed to find that the principal characters, by my standards, were dispicable. Charles Ryder, in particular, sent me off when he returned from the jungle and described his relationship with his wife and children (one of whom he had never met and whom he showed no interest in meeting). Through these eyes, I re-viewed Julia and her father and found them both contemptible. Although the era was full of elegance and physical beauty, it is not hard to understand its decline in the hands of such morally bankrupt characters."
4,JavaScript Objects,"Very good book. If your just looking for a JavaScript reference or a source for scripts, this is not the book. The authors take a serious approach to client-side applications using JavaScript and object-oriented code.Others have complained about the examples being too academic but I found them very appropriate for the kinds of things I'd do such as using regular expressions for form validation, binding of html elements to objects, etc., using tree and stack data structures for document parsing... Even if you already use these techniques I found it an effective way to teach the language."
2,Disappointing,"The main point that the authors attempt to make is that JavaScript can be a powerful and flexible object-oriented programming language. This book is better suited for the classroom than for real-world web development. Out of its 450+ pages, a single 30-page chapter deals with JavaScript in the browser.Since I have several years of C/C++ experience, I bought this book primarily for the object reference table in the appendix. As I began writing real JavaScript applications, however, it became clear that this book was more of a hinderance than a help -- that even the object reference was a watered down version of the Netscape documentation. For instance, the book makes no distinction between read/write and read-only properties. The programmer is left guessing whether his program is failing or the property is not writable.I found that ""JavaScript - The Definitive Guide"" by O'Reilly & Associates (ISBN 1-56592-392-8) covers browser objects much more thoroughy."
5,Great addition to my kitchen,I love this pan for cornbread. It comes out beautifully because it heats evenly. You need the two handles as the pan is heavy. Enjoy!!!!
3,"Interested concept, but not much fun","My son loves I Spy products, so I was excited to see this one. However, the punch out cards weren't completely cut, and the backings ripped on almost every one. Had to do some trimming and taping on a new product - very annoying. Glasses were packaged poorly, making the right lens on every pair bent. The 3-D effect worked, but my son grew quickly bored with it. I wouldn't buy this product again."
5,"A great, great album.","I picked up a copy of this CD (autographed, i might add) when I saw Graham Colton open up for Guster in Pittsburgh about four years ago. The album is one of the most enjoyable ones I own or have ever owned. It has everything you can want from this genre of music. If you can, pick up a used copy and you will fully enjoy."
2,bearing problems,Both the original and a replacement Keller dovetali bit quickly lost the lower seal on the bearing which will allow sawdust to build up in the bearing and will lead to premature failure.
1,Quick Buck Book doesn't deliver,"I was extrememly disappointed with this book. It promised ""Industrial Strength"" advice but was a poorly written, confusing exposition of the author's inability to create an intelligent technical book. The book contained many typos and misleading references. The CD had to be cleaned before it was usable; and it did not contain all the code shown in the book. The book is clearly a hastily put together device with an eye-catching title that didn't deliver. It irks me to know the author probably made money. He should personally apologize to all his customers."
5,Great set! I love it!,"I really loved this set from the start. I still pick of pieces to go with the room and my baby is 4 months old now! It is so nice and I have found many of the items just by going to different targets around the area. I would like to find the matching pillow, but havent been able to yet. Overall the quality is great and I have had no problems what so ever....i highly recommend it to anyone. love the animals, they are so cute!"
5,Check out eBay,"If you like this collection and want additional pieces (other matching sheet styles, chennile blankets, quilt clips, etc.) then you have to either search the stores in your area, or you can sometimes get them on eBay. I don't understand why Target doesn't list the full collection online, but it's their loss - I purchased the lamp, quilt clips, a switchplate, a fitted sheet (different than the style shown), and a fleece blanket all brand new, all on eBay. Just search for ""Tiddliwinks"" and you'll find the items.I've also had some luck shopping at a Target in a bordering state, and through my in-laws who live in another state close to a SuperTarget.This is a quality, fun bedding collection, good for boys and girls. I just wish Target didn't make it so difficult to obtain."
5,So cute!,"I just received a bunch of safari items from target.com for my baby due in March. I was disappointed that I couldn't find any items in the stores but decided to take a chance and order on-line. I was definitely pleased. All of the items are well made and look as nice in person as they do in the pictures on line. If you can't find it in the store, order on-line - these are great products!"
2,This book is Outdated,"I love O'Reilly books but this one was a big disappointment. -no mention of vectors -no use of namespace -no discussion of Inheritance in classes -generally outdated (publish date 1995).These topics alone are so commonly used in beginning C++ courses that the omission of these topics so basic to C++ is really horrifying. I ended up giving up on the book. After several attempts to refer to it for my classes I found it not just lacking in an explanation, but completely missing the topic. I just put the book in the corner to collect dust.O'Reilly really needs a better book than this one for such an important topic."
3,Practical C++ Programming,"I am a Fortran programmer for over 6 years. I found this book gave me tips to quickly get started and running C++ programmes. However, this book does not take the initiative in explaining concepts very well. Reading this book is not enough to get a good understanding of C++. I recommend that the reader of this book must read other books on this subject as well."
4,I enjoyed reading it.,I found the book enjoyable and refreshing to read.I've programmed in C before and I have found it a good book to make the transition. Theres lots of more general advice about debugging strategies andoptimization. Which I welcomed because it seems to me to be good advice.Christopher Gordon (South Africa)
2,Warmed-over C book...,"Steve Oualline has another book, Practical C Programming. I have not read that book, but judging the quality of the code examples in this book, I imagine that he ripped out about 75% of the code examples from that book. So many of his code snippets start with ""void main()"" that it drove me crazy! He gets it right, sometimes, with ""int main (void)"", but he is very inconsistent. The most egregious error, in my opinion, was an example he used to try to explain classes. He tries to use a ""class (name)"" example as a base class for tax forms!!! What is that? That is clearly not an ""is-a"" relationship, a term he conspicuously leaves out. The code throughout is not ANSI standard C++, and really needs to be cleaned up. Granted, the book was written before the ANSI standard was formally adopted, but this book should have long since been rewritten with the new standard in mind. Steer clear of this book!"
3,"3.5 stars. Not their best, but surely not their worst.","when i listen to a disc, i rate the quality of the recording of each instrument, along with the quality of the song writing. the production is great. the kick drum loses its oomph a little bit (a la Slipknot's Subliminal Verses), but everything is crystal clear. ""Convicted in Life"" and ""Buried Words"" are very heavy tunes, and really stick out on the album. there are a handful of mediocre songs, but overall, it's def worth a listen, and in my opinion is better than any album they've released since Chaos AD."
3,Decent. More like a later Entombed album.,"I heard the reviews saying this was a return to thrash for Sepultura. Not so much. I like the album, enough. But, I went back and listened to ""Arise"" and ""Beneath The Remains"", and realized how much intensity this album is missing. I just cannot stand to see a band like Sepultura put out an album with only 4 fast songs. What gives? I like the experimental stuff, but only as filler. The slow, repetitive Native American compositions are not content for a Metal album! Sorry."
4,Their finest work in ten years!,"Their finest work in 10 years! This record is a concept record, much like Zao's 'Liberate to ex inferus' about Dante's Divine Comedy, however unlike Zao, Sep stepped it up and made a very technical release. This is most definetly the best Derrick era release, featuring Andreas making some very technical chug patterns in songs like ""Dark wood of Error""(has a very dominating Meshuggah-ish style to it) and ""Fighting On""(2 of my favorites). The record tends to get more melodic as it continues on, with the lyrics following the passage of each of the 7 layers with songs like ""Ostia"". Other releases seam like they masked Paulo and Igor's playing, but on this record it's definetly all equal in the mix with Andreas. I can only see good things for the Seps with this record. Forget about who used to be in this band and start focusing on the fact that they are still making great cds. I'm giving this a 4.5"
5,Perfect Battery,Perfect battery. Perfect fit. Glad I had the room to make it fit. Don't have any problems starting my car now.
2,Sears Platinum Battery (Replaced Optima Yellow Top),"The Sears DieHard Platinum (AGM) blows away the Optima Yellow Top. Not even close.930 CCA, 130 minute reserve, 4 year free replacement (100 month pro rated warranty).Drops in without adapters or extra parts. $189 every day price at Sears.Cranks faster, runs better, brighter lights, audio sonics improved, etc.Optima batteries are overrated, period. Hands down, the Sears DieHard Platinum is superior.Optima Yellow Top (2 Stars) / Sears DieHard Platinum (5 Stars) NO CONTEST."
1,Does not last!,"I first bought this battery because i liked the idea of the deep cycle + I needed plenty of CCA. The first one failed in 2 years, around 24-25 months. I decided to replace it with the same battery, the new one failed in 15 months! that's 1 year! I never even used the deep cycle ability on this new one. I'm using it's warranty, hopefully they won't give me a hassle.But, considering both batteries died in less than 25 months, I would not recommend this battery. My car, 02 Honda accord needs plenty of CCA to start and this one stopped providing it way too early. For the price, it is really not worth it."
5,reality humor for adults only,"it's not funny that Mencia's humor is so funny because the topics are descriptions of how the great melting pot still isn't all tht great. The language is for adults, not kids."
4,Tao of Pooh is amazing!,"The Tao of Pooh was incredibly influential on who I am now. The book breaks down the basic concepts of Taoism into easy to understand terms and explains them using stories from the Pooh series. Even if you aren't a Taoist (I'm not), this book can teach you plenty about how to be content with the world as it is. If life is stressing you out, this book may be able to help. The Te of Piglet isn't as golden as the other, seems less heartfelt. It is worth giving a read though as well!"
5,Absolutely wonderful book for anyone,"This is most definitely not a kids book. Instead it is an excellent analysis of Taoism told through the stories of Pooh Bear. I have read it several times and bought multiple copies for gifts. It is an excellent read for anyone interested in philosophy, Taoism, or just wants an interesting and fascinating read."
4,A great way to learn about Taoism,"Back when I wanted to learn more about Taoism and was struggling to learn about its concepts, I came across this book. The use of Pooh and his adventures turned out to be an effective way to learn the principles of Taoism. I was at an age when I questioned and challenged everything that seemed wrong in my life. It certainly has helped me to find my inner peace."
3,"Good idea, but too critical","Overall, ""The Tao of Pooh"" is a good introduction to Taoism, and some of its chapters are extremely well-written. I was disappointed, however, when the book began heavily criticizing other philosophies, specifically those personified by Rabbit, Eeyore, and Owl. I don't see Taoism as being that intolerant, or unable to see the wisdom and logic of other theories. I think this would have been a much better book if it had focused on what Taoism *is,* instead of what it is *not.*"
5,Politics do not belong in pooh books!,"While I found both of these volumes to be quite good books, both from a literary and philosophical perspective, I have to say that certain comments, especially in the latter book, somewhat deteriorate it's enjoyability. The author's seemingly irrelevent comments on the evils of the Microwave, the Gulf War, Ronald Reagan, and republicans and conservatives in general, and the god-like qualities of one of the most corrupt politicians in our nation's history (John F. Kennedy) can't help but make you feel that he has some sort of perverted (and grossly incorrect) political agenda. Nonetheless, even if he dedicated a chapter to why we should elect Steve Forbes and impeach Clinton, I would still say that this sort of thing does not belong in books like these."
1,ANTS!,"I was not happy with my order, my boyfriend took the package out of the mailbox and it seemed fine until he opened it and about 50 ants came out of the package! The ants were sealed inside and were starting to eat the book."
1,Wordy,Surprisingly wordy given the topic. Cute drawings though and I like the idea of it more than the book. Maybe reading the originals with the same light might be more interesting.
5,Super!,"Love the video. It was in perfect shape and arrived in a timely manner. It was for my hubby's b-day and he loved it! It really took him back to the ""good ol' days!"""
5,Great Movie!,This is one of my all time favorite movies! The comedy and acting are so clever that I laughed all the way through. A great family film also.
4,Lighthearted Comedy,"If you're looking for Academy Award-winning cinematography, brilliant dialogue, and an intricate plot, this is probably not the movie for you. On the other hand, if you're searching for a fun little flick to keep you entertained, you might consider North Avenue Irregulars.The movie tells the story of 5 ladies (or 6, depending on your perspective) that join with the town's new Presbyterian minister to save the locals from a large gambling ring. Each of the would-be heroes has some flaw that keeps them one step behind the criminals.The dialogue is entertaining, with many funny remarks, and the personalities of the characters are well-played. If you're bored and up for a lighthearted comedy, consider North Avenue Irregulars."
5,The North Avenue Irregulars,This was a video we had been looking for for awhile. It came to me in the condition that it said it would. We are very pleased with the seller.
2,Try a different scale,"Have had this item about a week and already the screen is broken (the numbers have faded out).The directions are worded a bit strangely, so make sure to read all of them before using the scale.The information only stays on the scale for about 2 minutes, which seems a bit strange.Also, weight is measured in kg, lb, and stones. However, the switch does not seem to be set correctly as I have to set it to stone to show pounds.The overall quality of this product is not good. Would not recommend."
1,I ended up going back to my old Netgear card,"This card would not work with the 624 router. I keep losing the connection and then the router would disappear from my list of available networks, while my neighbor's network two doors down seems stronger than ever.Switched back to my old 22mbps Netgear card and the network has been stable so far. Not as fast, but at least it works and doesn't drop me."
4,Finally Got it Working Good,I bought the DWL-G650 card (Version B4) along with the the 624 Router (Version C1) about 5 weeks ago. I found it very hard to set up. XP Professional was installing its own drivers and would not recognize the D-Link drivers. It took me about 10 hours to resolve that issue. Customer support at D-Link was of no help. Then I had a dropped connection problem and a slow web surfing issue. I recently resolved that issue by upgrading my cable modem for free to a Toshiba PCX 2600. I was using a Toshiba PCX 1000. My point here is that there are so many factors that determine how this card will work for you. I'm getting 108mbps and hope I can continue to enjoy these fast speeds. It's no fun trying to fix things all the time.
1,"Terrible card, stay away","This card worked OK for about a week, then I started receiving the dreaded BSOD error nearly every time I used it on my Sony Vaio. I tried troubleshooting the problem for hours, even going so far as to reinstall Windows, but nothing fixed it. It just seemed to happen randomly, with no rhyme or reason. After finding out that others had the same issue with different hardware, I concluded that the card was simply a piece of junk. Stay away from this product unless you want to deal with the hidden horrors of D-Link's atrocious drivers."
5,"I Use it, so It's Got to be Easy!","I didn't really have much wireless networking experience before buying this D-Link PC Cardbus adapter and a D-Link wireless access point. I've certainly never set up a wireless network before.But doing my homework on the Internet while the product is being shipped to me, and reading the quick install guides that come with this product was quite helpful to say the least. I now know you should secure your wireless connection with some sort of encryption. So now Im all setup and this card lets me go wireless with my laptop.Very easy to use software, after reading instructions of course, and the hardware looks nice and solid. nothing flimsy about them. I have zero problems with this card in my laptop.I recommend this card for even the beginners."
2,was great until it starting flaking out,"installation was simple on my IBM T23 running W2k and I was up running in no time and getting good range & performance. after 6 mos, i upgraded firmware on my DI-624 and driver for the G650 and the G650 has been problematic ever since - it hangs my PC until I pull the card out. As others have noted, D-Link support didnt want to acknowlege the possibility that the card was bad. I'm at the point of chucking it and trying another brand. I have no such problems using an Orinoco-based ""b"" setup while I am at work."
3,Do not buy for use with an HP or Compaq laptop!,"This is the second D-Link PCMIA card I've owned, and they have both been good performers, except they interfere with Windows' power management features on HP and Compaq notebooks. I thought the problem would be solved by buying this newer card, but it hasn't. My computer refuses to stay powered on for more than 20 minutes unattended, and frequently, when browsing the Internet, my mouse cursor freezes and the only way out is to hit the power button. I did some online research, and it turns out many other HP and Compaq laptop users have had the same problem. For some reason, these incompatibilities still exist, despite D-Link knowing about them for some time.Again, D-Link cards perform well and are a good value, but I would not recommend one to an HP or Compaq user."
4,"Very hard to setup, but once setup, would work great","I bought 5 of these cards for 5 laptops and 3 of them r working after lot of work, but 2 of them r still not setup. And so they r not working. So basically its just about the luck to get it get it setup.But once setup, it works great."
4,"Works well, requires a software utility to work","The Setup was a bit odd as you need to install the software utility before installing the card. Reports connected at 108Mbps because a I have a DLink router that also supports it. You cant' the part that sticks out of the laptop feels a bit flimsy, but it'll probably good enough."
1,Wasted my money,Installation was quick but signal range is extemely poor. Unless you want to work in the same room or floor the signal will be single to two bars max. I am also losing internet signal every 30 minutes or so. Now I have purchased belkin from circuit city with two antenas (forgot the model #) and things are perfect.
2,Bad compatibility and customer support,I had troubles with ths router - it didn't handle communication with Linsys G card. But the most surpising experience is one with customer support - unprofessional and rude. It's a last time I'm buying their products.
2,shipping,The router is good- ... 3btech is less than dismal on shippingI ordered with a 3day select ups ship and received over the 3 dayperiod - they had some lame story about not shipping until the 1st full business day - .. which was two days AFTER I placed the order - they refused to do anything refund wise -I will never do business with them again-
1,Stay Away!,"I have this router and just bought the Linksys WRT54G to replace it. BEFORE you buy the D-Link 624 go to DSLREPORTS and read the D-Link Forum section. As for all the trouble, I thought it was me. I get constant disconnects (rebooting router) I can't get my PocketPC with a Socket WLAN card to connect and my configure screens won't paint correctly. This router is a TURKEY. Those that got it to work are LUCKY! I'm on firmware 2.42, which is current as I write this. I originally bought the 624 (at Costco) because my 614+ fritzed out. Why did I even waste my time. I learned about the DSLREPORTS forum by accident, didn't know of it before I purchased. The 624 is going back.COMMENT: To the person who didn't find this review helpful, what would you have liked me to say? I hope you enjoy your new DI-624!"
1,not recommended!!!,"pros:all the unimportant features that it claims to do.very fast and pretty good range.cons:-all the features are useless if the router reboots and drops every hour. (even every minute sometimes)-firmware 2.42 drops my entire connection, which means i have to turn off my dsl modem as well as rebooting the router.-the newly upgraded 2.50 firmware is worse. people who are considering to buy this router will get the 2.50 version.-firmware 2.50 have issues with routers rebooting, not connecting, i can't obtain a ip address sometimes with my dell 600m.http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum/remark,11580469~mode=flat~days=9999~start=160the link will tell you what other people think about the frequent reboots.-terrible tech support.-the advertised 108 mbps does not acheive expectations. (extremely noticeable when transferring files from a desktop and laptop, vice versa)"
2,Not impressed,"Seems like a good enough product - if would work. I set it up as a simple (wired) router, and got it to work. Problem is, about 80% of the time, after it's been on for awhile, I'll lose internet connection through it. Remove the router from the picture, and my internet connection is solid. Put the router back in, and it will be solid; for awhile. Then it loses connection again and may or may not resume proper operation some time later. Perplexed."
3,Works well with Mac G4; ethernet conn. to G3 unsolved!,"I bought this hoping to be able to create a home network consisting of my Powerbook G4 wireless (successful after 5-6 calls to d-link tech support and 1 each to verizon and Apple) and my older Powerbook G3 hard wired into the router.I have tried various settings to get the G3 working, called D-link and verizon (says they dont support d-link) on this separtate issue and D-link basically says that because the router is finally working with my G4, it must be something other than their hardware, and they don't care to deal with it. If anyone out there has a mac g3 hard wired to this thing...or any ideas...I would love to hear from you.....jamadd@buffnet.net. As for the wireless performance, I am so far satisfied with the device. It is my first wireless router, so I have nothing to compare with."
2,"Easy install, but the range wasn't good enough","I intended to use the D-Link DI-624 to replace an SMC 802.11b wireless system that was 2 years old. The SMC system worked really well, but it did need to be reset every few days and I wanted whole house coverage. After going through the D-Link's simple installation procedure, I was up and running. Unfortunately, my range was reduced by at least 50% from the SMC's range. I upgraded the firmware and unplugged my cordless phones and still had the same mediocre results."
1,"dlink will not send rebates,, trouble with product.","I bought this item july 29 and this is december,I am told that my rebate is in the system but it might take a while.4 months!!!the router has also give me problems from the start. I will never buy from d-link again....."
1,Broken,"Reboots itself if too much data is transferred.""too much"" for me consisted of one SSH session and one World of Warcraft session, so I couldn't do work while my roommate was playing world of warcraft. This is obviously unacceptable."
2,"Put your money in something really good, not this!","Bought this device even after some unfavorable reviews because of the big advertisement and it was expensive and thought that something bad would be really cheaper. Big mistake, the signal is so weak that I live in a 2 bedroom apartment (very small) and my systems report a low signal at 15 ft. Locks up a lot and have to reset very frequently, while the system is open (no security) it is fine but after some security configuration is a mess.(...)"
2,Connectivity problems,"While tech support was helpful, they were not able to solve major connectivity issues - namely that the router dropped packets frequently. This meant that it kept disconnecting some applications. D-Link acknowledges that there may some difficulty using Yahoo Messenger, for example, especially with more than one computer at a time. An another note, the administrative tools were comprehensive but perhaps bewildering for novice users. The modem also lacked the ability to summarize all connected clients in a single screen. All of this is unfortunate given that the router typically receives top ratings for performance. In the end, it was more trouble for me than it was worth."
1,Waste of money - no range,"From the word go, this router has been painful. I have a 1-room radius from this piece of junk. Sometimes, I one bar on my iphone with it sitting ontop of the router!Easy set up and everything, just doesn't work when set up!"
4,This seems to be a hit!,"I was drawn in by the rebate and Amazon's generally good rep. I bought this for a customer and tested it at home first. Some of the reviews I have seen made me wary.Everything went smoothly with the exception of setting up WPA security. It may just require some tweaking. The native WEP works just fine. Since this will be used with a very low security project, that won't be a problem.Signal strength and coverage was great even with the built-in wireless (802.11b) on my laptop. It also gave me 36MB although 11b is only rated for 11MB. It had no problems with servicing a standard wired PC at the same time. I didn't have the constant reboot problem that others have had, however it did ship with the latest firmware preinstalled.I am considering getting another one for the house."
2,Connection Problems - cannot use all features,"I have had this router for over a year. It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection, for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every 10 mins because router reboots itself. I have made over a dozen calls to tech support, but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11b config with no encryption ( the most they would let me do was WEP, and always turned down WPA ). So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them. That is because if you try and it does not work, tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off. Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11b."
1,Constant reboots. Annoying.,"This is a great router if you don't plan on ever doing any serious usenet downloads or p2p file sharing.The massive traffic generated by either of these applications makes the router think it's being pinged to death. Instead of filtering out the requests or doing something else, the router reboots itself! How great is that. Several firmwares later and the problem remains.As of the 2.42 firmware, this router is vulnerable to the 'targa3' exploit, a test of which results in a reboot. Many other routers are not vulnerable to targa3, but this one is.I'd advise against the DI-624. Its been nothing but trouble."
5,thank God something works,"Installation a breeze; two laptops and one desktop immediately recognized simple cable switch from linksys. Much better range and speed than WRT-54G (anyone interested in used router?). This review from someone frazzled after spending the prior 12 hours performing ""quickrestore"" (uh huh) on personal laptop, which blew out after windows sp2 recommended update (beware of ""improved windows"",another story)"
4,Good one,I haven't faced any major problem yet. The D-Link DI-624 Wireless Cable/DSL Router is doing fine since 8 months when I bought it from Amazon.
1,Router was broken in less than one month,"totally stopped working in about 4 weeks...the technical support is aweful, takes about 35 mins waiting time to get to the support, the phone connection can kill you, I have to hang it up and call again.I wil shun from D-link for everything from now."
1,Please buy another Not this,-10 StarCons:- DHCP networking- Problem with another 2.4Gb devices like wireless phone- Restart the services without any apparently problem- Problem to setting ADSL services with VERIZON- Not connect a Linksys phone for Voip Adapter (block the device)I make 2 firmware update and continue the problem
1,Doesn't work for me,"I've been using a D-Link DI-614+ router and it works fine. I bought a DI-624 to upgrade from 11b to 11g. The 624 connected fine to the other machines in my home network and the computer showed an internet connection present, but no matter what I tried I couldn't access the internet. All the settings were the same as the 614. The computer would time out and offer to use my back up dial-up connection. I asked for help from D-Link tech support by email. They made a few very basic suggestions that didn't work, then stopped answering my emails. I gave up and returned the unit to Amazon for a refund. (Amazon's easy returns are great!)"
1,Not compatible with your Toshiba Cable modem,"I have already tried two D-Link DI-624 routers. Why? The first one, tech support said it was defective. The second one, they could not provide any help after going through all the troubleshooting steps. Actually, both had same issue. If you use COX cable, don't waste your time, go ahead to get Linksys Wireless G. Cox supports Linksys only (and Linksys is from Cisco)."
1,Constantly require reset until failed to connect,Will never buy D-link again. Do not know if D-link ever tests their product before releasing. These folks probably never used their own stuff. It's just not working. Very annoying. Big waste of time and money.
1,My 3rd one keeps rebooting every few minutes,This product is awful. I have exchanged it a few times and spent countless hours on the phone with them. It still keeps on rebooting itself every few minutes. Plus they keep costing me shipping and keep charging me for some parts I don't seem to send back. When you have to send yours back and you will. Make sure you put all cable and plastic pieces back in. The worst I have ever owned.
1,Good router but one big problem,"This is a great router for the most part as the other reviews will tell you, but it has one big flaw: It can't coexist with 2.4GHz cordless phones. As soon as me or my neighbor pick up the phone, its dead. Cycle the power and click repair on the network connections. Extremely annoying as I went through two of these before I realized this was the problem. Unless you are sure no one in your area has a 2.4GHz device, avoid this router."
1,Ok for 6 months...now nothing,"Ok, at first I was impressed. It worked right out of the box, not a problem. I have had the thing for 6 months now and suddenly its dead. Spent 2 hours on with tech support...they can't fix it. Now they agree to RMA it but I had to pay for shipping...they will look at it and then send us another one if it is broken...in the mean time I have to deal with not being able to use the internet..just use my roomates computer which we just connected now directly to the internet modem. This is ridiculious!! I plan on just buying a new one becuase I don't have a month or two to wait on D-Link to look at it and tell me its broken nor the time to pack all this up and send it back to them at my expense. Come to find out all kinds of people have had the same problem. STAY AWAY! Get a belkin or linksys router...you'd be better off."
2,Average Router. Good for everything except Torrenting.,"This is not a bad router, but it is not a good one either.Not only it doesn't allow high speed downloading torrent files, it keeps rebooting itself if you do use any torrenting client program.However, for everyday web browsing, gaming, and network protection, it really does an OK job.I guess the only really great router D-link can give us is its 120+ dollars Gaming router. So if you insist on getting a D-link router and you have to download torrent files, don't buy this one."
1,Techsupport: You don't need WEP!,Whenever I enabled WEP my D-link router would drop connections. All 3 wireless devices in my home (3 laptops) all indicate the router's signal died. I called D-link tech support and they told me I should use MAC Address Filtering and not WEP since it's more secure that way. What a complete B.S.!!! MAC Address cloning can get past this weak protection anyday. Is this their excuse for shipping a crappy router with broken WEP technology? I'll never buy from Dlink again.
4,Eurotrash mini-classic,"Nude for Satan is yet another interesting release from the Redemption line of Image Entertainment. Chock full of bizarre satanic rituals, nudity and horrific images, it illustrates fully the wonders of European low budget horror. Definetly not for the casual viewer, but well worth the time for genre fans. The DVD transfer is probably the best presentation this film has and will ever receive."
1,NudeFor?no plot.,"Thank God for Instant streaming Nflix,otherwise I would never rent this even if I was paid,the nudity doesn't make for a plot.The Subtitles don't match the dubbed English Dialogue(Italian Film,no Surprise right?)The movie drags on despite nudity from the start(the distribution co apparently runs the credit with nudity).A waste of time."
3,Italian Sex and Gothic,"""Nude for Satan"" is a fairly entertaining exercise in the Italian Gothic style, somewhat reminiscent of ""Castle of Terror"", but with more explicit sexual content. Comparing it to the other Redemption videos I have seen, I would say it is not quite as good as ""The Devil's Nightmare"", but is considerably better than ""The Reincarnation of Isabel"". Certainly Rita Calderoni is used to better effect here."
5,Great Shows,"Great shows, although some of my favorite songs are missing...that is okay VFTV4 has them."
1,Chunk of Junk,"People here are complaining about uncomfortable headphones. Low quality connectors. Bad sound.They are the lucky ones!Connection is provided by Bluetooth protocol, Bluetooth requires pairing, and this ""device"" loses pairing as soon as adapter is connected to the sound source."
1,Disappointing,"This was the worst hair clipper I have ever used. It didn't cut hair at all, but just combed through it. The blades worked intermittantly, seemed to work about 1% of the time I was attempting to give the haircut, however it was mostly like combing through the hair without cutting anything. It sounded like the blades were turning off and on, whether plugged in or charged. I think this was a defective unit, I returned it for a refund but seller would not return delivery and return shipping which amounted to almost as much as the unit itself. Ultimately, I was dispppointed not only in the product but the service as well, and am not sure I will order from Amazon again."
5,Lightweight clippers with great features,"As other reviewers have noted, if you need heavy duty cutting clippers there are much better products available.On the other hand, if you want a clipper set that is lightweight, cordless, comes with two easy to adjust 1/8 to 1 3/4 inch comb guides at a reasonable price you will probably enjoy this product as much as I do."
3,Dissatified with Amazon,I returned this product two weeks ago just as instructed (not for quality) and have not been notified of the retun status nor a refund for the product.
5,Incredible! A real treat for the ears!!!,"This is a phenominal recording of Kenton's christmas charts, and they are finally performed as they should've been! The Capitol Bones Big Band is tremendous. Note after note, each arrangement is flawless. Again, it's great to hear these Kenton Christmas charts recorded with concern for intonation, contrast, and outstanding musicality. Once you've listened to The Capitol Bones blowing down these charts, you'll never listen to Kenton's ""Merry Christmas"" the same way. Buy it!"
4,An surprisingly ignored but awesome album for its time....,"When I got this album in '95, I'd never heard of them, but wanted to try something new, and I wasn't disappointed. When I heard ""Clock,"" I was simply floored. Wow! These guys had something! Imagine Nirvana meets Metallica, and that should give you some idea. ""Clock"" and ""Dry Riser"" should have, by all rights, dominated the radio waves of that era. But alas, it wasn't to be. If you're interested in the music of that era, and particularly in the more innovative sounds of that time, definitely check this out...."
3,A DVD I would't watch twice,"Hi,this DVD is nice to watch once but I defenetly regret buying it because I won't watch it again. My daughter kept losing interest and could't stay focused. The movie is a little boring. Hope my kids turn into huge dolphin fans so we get a little use out of it."
1,Made in China,"I wish I had known these were made in China, I never would have bought them. There is currently an epidemic of illness and death related to pet foods manufactured in China, including products by this manufacturere (Cadet). These are going in the garbage."
4,Good but how does it end,"I thought that it was a very interesting and helpful look at Alzheimer. Since it was written in 1999 according to some of the medical facts used, I thought the editor should have added a note at the end telling the author's condition after 12 years."
4,Losing My Mind,"I purchased this book because my mother has just been diagnosed with Azheimer's. This book has helped me to empathize with what my mom is presently going through and what she will be going through. The author is the one with the disease and so the book is written about what he is experiencing and thinking. It gets a little confusing at times when he jumps into the past telling about his growing up years and then back to the present and then to what the doctors are saying. However, the confusion is small on my part compared to what he must have been experiencing in his own mind. It is a great book for those who have family experiencing this horrible disease."
3,Losing My Mind Review,"While this book was informative and gave important and current facts about Alzheimer's research, I found myself thinking there was no ""wow"" factor in this book. The author, Thomas DiBaggio, talks about an uneventful past and repeats over and over that he is having difficulty writing the novel, but there was only one point in the book where I was actually captivated by his own thoughts. The most enjoyable part was reading about the current research. The book may have been more interesting if it had been attempted in the later stages of Alzheimer's because, at this stage in his disease, this book made DiBaggio seem like a depressed man, with a mild memory impairment. I do commend him though for attempting to write this novel during this difficult time in his life, I just felt that his writing was not entirely captivating."
2,Alzheimers + untreated depression: almost unbearably sad,"I'm in the minority...I was disappointed in this book. It feels almost cruel to write a negative review because the author is admirably open and sincere, and his suffering is profound. But he seems to suffer from untreated depression as well as from Alzheimers. His unremitting anger and despair make his experiences (and ours as readers) even sadder than they need to be. I kept wishing he would take the energy he was using to write the book and put it into being more open with his family, or finding a therapist or a hospice-type program that would provide him and his family with ongoing support. Altogether a sad and moving book, but also a frustrating one."
3,A good conclusion to the Ender Quartet,"Children of the Mind is an excellent read. The plotline is intense, the interpersonal-relationships are complex, and the characters are realistic. Card answers all the questions he brought up in the first three books (which, in my opinion, were better). My only complaint is that some of Card's spiritualism can get pretty bizarre at times. The bit about auia's struck me as unrealistic. But as a whole, Children of the Mind is definately a worthy choice."
4,Not as fast paced as Ender's Game - Still a Great Read,"OSC is one of the best writers in the US today. In fact I will go so far as to say he is second only to Stephen King.This book is not a stand-alone book, it is a sequal to Ender's Game. I read this book around 1996. I heard about Ender's Shadow a month or two ago and have recently finished the series. I have read all of the Ender and Shadow series and will continue to do so as long as they keep being written.If you are not familiar with OSC, he is also the author/playright of the Abyss! Ender's Game is planned to be made into a movie by WB and the producer of a Perfect Storm.This book is about Ender's life off-planet after having saved the world. This book is very philosophical and has less action. It is a not as fast paced as Ender's Game. I would say more about the book, but I hate people giving away any information about books and movies so I won't."
1,One of the worse books I've ever read,"Characters - Who cares? Plot - What plot? Science - No, not really. This is by far one of Card's weakest books, I guess he just felt he had to finish the series and Ender. Kind of Sad after the wonderful Ender's Game and the Good Speaker for the Dead. Read ""Lovelock"", it's a wonderful book, stay away from this one!"
3,"Matches those that come before it, not Enders Game","If we were looking for a trip back to brilliance by Orson Scott Card when we picked up this last book, we were sorely dissappointed. Enders Game is truly the only excellent piece of literature to come out of this series. Card seemed to be struggling for a plot. His examination of Japanese culture and of obsessive compulsive disorder is interesting, but he seems unable to really tie it in with the rest of the book and to me it seems like a gimic. I however have read everything that Card has written and might be a harsher critic of his writings than those who have just been reading his Ender series. It is certainly a fun and easy read, it just doesn't match up with Enders Game, Songmaster, or The Worthing Saga (my three favorite books by Card)."
4,Mind Bending,"I don't know why I was a little disappointed in this book. I was excited to see the characters I left behind during the last Orson Scott Card read, that was the wrong one. This at least continued plot points that I wanted to see expanded on. But at least twice I felt the author came to an end. Middle of the book could have been an ending. At least Mr. Card didn't leave us there. The actual ending was much more satisfying.As of today I have the next book in the series in my Kindle ready and waiting. But I will try and read other ""real"" books awaiting review before I get started. My friends were right. I am addicted to Ender and his games! :)"
2,Read ENDERS GAME and ENDERS SHADOW skip the rest,ENDERS GAME and ENDERS SHADOW are two of the best science fiction books ever. The other books in the series are bubble gum for the brain
1,Embarassingly Bad,"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:There is absolutely no reason on earth to read this book. None. Reading it only makes you angry, bitter, and unhappy. If you bear any love of any kind for Ender Wiggin of Ender's Game, then you must not read this book lest you destroy that memory forever.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:You know, maybe Tor has made enough money robbing the graves of superior authors and pressing living authors of potential into some kind of servitude in working for their private pulp mill. Send a message to these guys by not buying this book and announcing, finally, that you are not a mindless lemming that will purchase any sort of book so long as it has the right pedigree. Have some discrimination and read something new and good; those books are out there.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"
3,pretty good end,this book was good but i think it dragged just a liitle to much.however it is worty of being in the enders series.
2,meh,I really enjoyed the first 3 books of the Ender series. This one- it was not very compelling. It took me weeks to finish where the first 3 books took a couple of days.
2,How could this happen?,"I dunno--I liked the other three books in the series. For some reason, though, this one just seemed tedious. Character interaction is there, sure, but it seems dull and plodding. Everything about it just seems to lack the spark that usually makes Card so great. I suppose if you've read the rest of the series you'll probably want to read this one too, but don't expect too much. Card's biggest (only?) letdown."
5,Philosophy and Fiction,"This is not Card's best work, but it's one of the finestbooks that I've read in a very long time. Card writesfiction; yet his work has a finer sense of truth thanmuch 'fact'.I have heard derogatory comments on his concluding note;let me just say that it is Card's intense personalinvolvement with his stories that make them worth reading."
2,Terrible,"It wouldn't matter what series this was in. If this was the first book in the Lord of the Rings it would still be bad. The plot is over blown and time and again vanishes into strange tangents. I wish it was not in the ""Ender Series."" In fact I wish I could get my money back"
1,Do not waste your time on this one.,"As often found with writers of a highly succesful book: the subject is streched beont it's limits. The story drags on for pages without anything happening and wasting paper on surrogate deep thoughts. To quote Salerie from the movie ""Mozart"" this book just has ""to many notes"", being to many words. It could have been a short story for a magazine, not a full volume in what could better have been a trilogy or a single book for that matter."
3,far fetched ...,"everybody is a mind reader in this book, everybody knows exacly what everyone else is thinking, why they are thinking it, and whay they think they think it ... not so good...."
5,"Wonderful end , for even more wonderful saga.","Children of the mind , although trying to close tomany of the marvelous dilemas concerning the deep and thoughtful character Andrew Wiggin , is a veryintresting thoughs-trigger and a very good end fora saga which I concern to be one of the best Sci-fi books ever."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I really loved the Ender series. I thought Speaker for the Dead was better than Ender's Game and Xenocide was building on that untill Ender's umm... children came into being. Then Xenocide got weird. This book doesn't end this series like it should have. It continues on similar to the last hundred or so pages of Xenocide, and can be compelling, but lacks the substance of Speaker. Speaker was a sci-fi book that actually had a human story, based on human problems, and was a masterpeice. Children of the mind just deviates from that as much as possible. None of the problems faced by Peter or Jane are realistic in any sense. However the book is still a fun read for people such as myself that really enjoyed the rest of the series. It just lacks substance."
3,A good value,"Whereas purists might cry foul at re-recordings, I have enjoyed this collection for years. Some of the tracks are the original versions. In fact, I don't think anything really sounds inferior. And frankly, 22 tracks from such a talented voice at a bargain price makes for a good value. Plus, there are a few rare gems here, such as the haunting Jimmy Webb-penned tune ""Song for my Brother."""
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen,This movie was the worst experience I have ever had in my life. Please do not spend any money to see this movie. You will surely regret it for all of your days.
1,-1* (= minus one star),"Possibly the worst movie of 2002 - sadly, featuring a talented, entertaining group of actors. All who watched it should be paid handsomely for those minutes of our lives.Works off a silly concept that is further undermined by a less forgivable execution: clunky writing with lots of white space punctuated by psychedelic nonsense and lame plot devices that fail to develop any aspect of the film; sophomoric characters in sophomoric relationships; scenes (and their rationales) often unintelligible; well-known Anglo-Saxon sex word is prominent and is at least understandable, but over the long hours, it's no substitute for actual screen writing.A disappointment and waste of time with Adam Sandler's name on it. Unfortunate."
1,movie with no point,This was the worst Adam Sandler movie ever. It was stupid and has absolutely no point.
1,If you actually think,"that this is anything other than a complete waste of celluloid and time, I pity you, because you are an idiot."
2,"I love Adam Sandler, Hate THIS movie, but to each his own","My title pretty much sums it up, & yes I read the reviews. Adam is one of my all time faves & I am a loyal fan, but this was a waste of mine & Adams time. I agree w others he is talented & puts a different spin on things & pulls it off, I even appreciate that this is based on a true story & completely understand 'Art Appreciation' I love u Adam, will u marry me?! Just plz stick to the Adam we all grown to love unless u do something like u did in Reign over me. xoxoxox"
1,Whoa,"I rented this because I like Adam Sandler and i thought i would be funny. It was not funny at all. In fact, it was so not funny that i was tramitized by the unfunnyness and i will never be the same."
2,"I didn't get ""it""","I like Adam Sandler, but I didn't like or ""get"" this movie's point at all. Forewarning: This is not Sandler's typical role. I'm all for him branching out into different styles and I think he's quite capable, except I had a very hard time getting past that because of all the weirdness in this film.The opening sequence is just bizarre and you wonder throughout the entire film what the point of the instrument is. The relationship between Sandler and his love interest is equally bizarre. This has DEFINITELY an indie type of film feel, but does not come close to ONE HOUR PHOTO, which I think also has the same type of feel, yet is far superior. This movie is disturbing at times and confusing at others. I felt like I was doing drugs during this movie (which I can assure you I was not). The ending is a ""Huh?"""
2,a totally senseless contrite ridiculous waste-of-time,"yeah, i have to lower down my wits to appreciate the shallow depth of this film, so pretentiously trying to be very philosophically deep. a portrayal of modern day ulysisism, loneliness, emptyness, void, loss, stress...blahblahblah, whatever you like to throw into this senseless film, and you have to say you understand it, appreciate it, deeply moved, wow, so meaningful, so....well, maybe i got no wits or totally clueless, but this movie obviously lost me. like attending a party, all the people around talking deep, but you just can't understand what they are talking about, and what's the purpose of trying to talk shallow thoughts with a philosophic attitude. you just keep nodding your head to show that you are totally agree to what they are saying, but deep down you just know they are all but crap. there is actually no weapons of mass destruction, but who gives the...., what've done is already done."
3,WEIRDLY FASCINATING BUT FINALLY FIZZLES,"Adam Sandler nearly goes legit in Paul Thomas Anderson's PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. Sandler's Barry Egan -- socially inept, prone to angry outbursts and bullied by a bunch of big sisters -- pursues potential true love (the marvelous Emily Watson) while avoiding phone-sex extortionists. Interesting looking film does not make up for bizarre screenplay that finally peters out."
1,NOT SANDLER AT ALL!!,"I waited forever for this to come out on dvd because I was over seas when it came out and missed it. I really didn't miss anything. I LOVE Sandler and own all his movies, I bought this as soon as it came out today and was so disappointed I couldn't believe it. If you like you're typical sandler flicks like I do, don't waste your money on this one, he did not write, produce or have anyhting to do with it other than acting in it. All in all It SUX!! SOrry to ever say that about a Sandler flick but this is just lame."
5,A true origional,"This movie is new, a separate genre that is as interesting as it is strange. I enjoyed this movie because there was no way I could relate to Adam Sandlers character. Watch him evolve was one of the funnyest, most inspiring things I have ever seen."
1,"Better than a hole in the head, not really","This movie can be described best with one word: Horrible! My wife and I watched it together and agree that it is possibly or probably the worst movie ever. It had absolutely no point, contained many not-needed curse words, and was all together a bore."
4,If you love to get drunk on the spiked punch.....,"...this ain't the flick for you.I thought it was very odd. I didn't find it at all funny. Adam Sandler did a great job though - his character was truly pathetic. Emily Watson was sublime. The ""plot"" was mostly absurd, which I guess is why it's supposed to be a comedy. A dark comedy, at best.Definitely see it; it's the kind of film that probably has a widely variable impact - which is completely viewer-dependent."
4,Beautiful piano!,"As always, Reader's Digest make top quality collections. This is no exception. Fine piano music that you'll truly enjoy! Mike Zimmer"
2,N*@##a Please!,This guy was Chicago's answer to MC Hammer. He should have been arrested for making this CD. I liked him better when he was into House Music.
1,Metro Baldfader - Did Not Work,"The Baldfader I ordered did not work. I carefully followed the instructions for aligning the blades, contacted Wahl and followed their troubleshooting instructions and still could not get the clippers to cut at all - they just scratched up my scalp. I promptly returned them and just got a small and less expensive beard trimmer at my local pharmacy, which has worked just fine. It may have been anomalous, but my experience was very poor."
5,Informative and entertaining,"I have loved seeing this video series on CNN and am excited at the prospects of using it with my high school classes! I found the episodes to be informative, entertaining and able to hold the attention of this teacher but more importantly my students. I gave them a sneak preview using the 60's video this last week. With all of the news of space shots, moon walks and Kennedy's, we have had many lively question and answer sessions.The video really helped give pictures and sound to the words in the book. I don't know how I feel yet about being a primary source of information for the decades from the 60's to the present! I am very glad to have these videos as part of my arsenal of tools to use in my classes."
4,One more output,"Excellent product for the money. The HDMI is nice, but a simple s-video output would be a win. Anyway, easy to set-up, pretty easy menus and it arrived ahead of schedule."
5,Get Rich or Die Tryin' - REALESTATE!,"What can I say, DOLF is the master - He is the Australian Donald Trump! The book is PERFECT in every way shape and form. I immediately went out and tried some of these techniques and they WORKED! I marked the book with notes and go back and read it from time to time to stay fresh.Great book if you are serious about becoming a MILLIONAIRE in the world. Real estate is the fastest way to doing just that.This book is a must read if you want to be rich."
3,good points but overly simplistic,Dolf brings good points about property1) having more control than paper assets2)Leverage3)Tax benefits4)How inflation works in your favorBut a bit of it is overly simplistic.Anyone would know La is a hotter market than Idaho.
5,"""10-star"" childrens' book in English and Russian!","A little Mouse, aloft in his balloon, sees an ominous shadow approaching the country of his people! Fleeing homeward, he cries warning to every Mouse he meets: ""Here comes the Cat! Ciuda idyot Kot!"" Soon the alarm is being passed from one to the other, until the entire Mouse population awaits in dread the arrival of the Cat. What will happen when Mice and Cat come face to face? Something quite unexpected! Significantly, this lovely little book is the creation of two authors, one American and the other Russian. After meeting in 1986 at a Soviet/American childrens' book symposium, they decided to collaborate on a tale with a message of harmonious coexistence. Vladimir Vagin's exquisite, highly-detailed, colorful paintings must be seen to be appreciated. And Frank Asch's story of fear and friendship will warm the hearts of adults and children lucky enough to read ""Here Comes the Cat!"""
4,Text book description,"It was advertised as like new, however I did not think it was quite that good. Many pages had holes, folds & wrinkled Arrived as promised."
2,good enuf...,"OK, so this works as a hammock--as advertised. I had one of these before, and the chief complaint I had with it was that the holes in the mesh are so large that long naps result in a painful mesh mark on which ever side was pointed down. BUT it worked great for a quick cat nap."
2,Want more info?,"Hi, I live in Hungary, and if U aRe interested I can send you some infos about the Hungarian actors in this this film.I think they are the best thing in this film :-)"
1,Wrong edition,"Although the picture is of the correct edition, the wrong edition was sent. It was not the Little Leather Library edition as advertised. It was for a gift and I didn't have any time to send it back or I would have. False advertising."
5,In some chapters it is gross.,"Zak,Tash and Hoole go to Necropolis to buy a new ship.Karin tells them to stay at the hostel.Once they get in there Boba Fett tells them he is tracking down Dr.Evazan.Then Kairn and Zak goes into the graveyard.Kairn dares Zak to go to the cyrpt of the ancients and stick a knife into the grave.Then the dead are rising."
2,where are the rules?,"Simplicity of it... the first of 45 minutes of it was intriguing, then it just falls apart."
2,Not what I had expected !,"I had seen some really good reviews for this film and the previews were intriging. The characters are under developed; the cinemaphotography was the best thing about the movie. There were some scenes that reflected the title, but overall it was meaning less dribble. I thought it to be one of the 10 worst films of this last year. I thought that it had great potential, but someone missed the boat all together in prepping the book for film. A BIG disappointment. Rent this; but do not bother with the purchase."
4,An underrated guilty pleasure,"Roger Avery approaches the material with a funny light, highenergy touch, not asking us to take Brett Easton Ellis's nihilism too seriously.Consequently, a film where every character is deeply flawed and narcissistic is neverboring, and often full of a visceral energy. It even has moments where itbecomes quite moving. And most of the showy style tricks work with the excesses of thestory.OK, sometimes the style is self-concious, and some elements are too familiarand on the nose (Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz as boozy moms who choose notto see how screwed up their kids are, the extra shallow treatment of the gay character.etc).While I understand how some could be repulsed, personally I thinkthis deserved better than it got from most critics. I enjoyed watching it,was never bored, and even made to think.A fun soundtrack and Tomandandy score too.You may love it, you may hate it, but it's inventive enough that it's worth decidingfor yourself."
3,College Triangle-Drama...,"Rules of Attraction is based on love, relationships, and friendships which have been given a dose of irony and satire. The story centers on three characters at Camden College where everyone seems to know everyone, and where one thing leads to another. Paul Denton has recently fallen in love with Sean Bateman, who is a broke drug dealer who has slept with a large amount of the female population at the college and who finds himself being attracted to Lauren Hynde. Lauren is a virgin in the traditional sense and scares her own temptations by reading a STD book for medical students; however, she is planning on having sex with her beloved boyfriend Victor. Paul, Sean, and Lauren are brought together through a series of events triggered by others and their own object of affection. Rules of Attraction has some fascinating cinematography and editing that brings the story together, and it leaves the audience with an pleasant cinematic experience."
3,A Surprising and Guilty Pleasure,"The Rules of Attraction is thought provoking and amazingly surreal without being cheesey. However, this movie lacks any real heart and never gives you the chance to connect with a character. The soundtrack almost makes up for this, including The Cure and a disturbing scene involving Harry Nillson's 'Without You'.The formula for the Rules of Attraction could of produced a masterpiece of a movie, but something seems to be missing. The film seems to skip through different topics without ever getting a main message across."
4,An addicting dark comedy.,"'The Rules of Attraction' follows three characters: Sean(A drug dealing psychopath in love with Lauren) Lauren(An eccentric virgin) and Paul(A bisexual guy who is Lauren's ex and is in love with Sean).Filled with interesting filming and editing the movie is addicting to the very end. The plot is a little underdeveloped however. 'The Rules of Attraction' is a very dark comedy, and may not be for everyone.The suicide scene is painful to watch, because of your feelings for the character not because of gore. And there are more funny scenes than depressing ones, including a description of a European vacation and character named Richard ""Dick"" at lunch. In the end, I felt very attached to all the characters. The movie is based on a novel, which after seeing the movie, I am very interested in reading.I would suggest this movie to anyone who likes dark comedies and anyone who likes more artistic films. I would not suggest this film to people who don't understand black comedy."
3,Not outstanding but not bad,"This movie is kind of random and weird, but i like films like that and recon they're cool. The main character is Sean (James Van Der Beek) who is a drug dealer oweing a lot of money. Then theres Lauren (Shannyn Sossaman) who is a virgin, waiting to lose her virginity to Victor (Kip Parude). Enter Paul (Ian Somerhalder) who wants to get with Sean. Its like a love triangle, but more like a rectangle. Without getting complicated, the basic outline of the film is. Sean is a guy whos a bit of a ladys man, he falls for Lauren. Paul meets Sean at a party and wants to be with him. Victor is sought after by the ladies and is Laurens ideal man, he is away in Europe most of the film. This is a hard film to explain and i dont think im doing a very good job of it, so i suggest you go rent it for yourself, and ladies rent for Ian Somerhalder, so hot! Anyway overall not a bad film pretty cool, above average."
4,About the BLU-RAY release.,I dont understand the release date of April. I bought my copy of the UNRATED bluray at Best Buy last week for 9.99 along with Out of Sight for 15.00. The picture is better than the DVD release not great but ok. Still very grainy in parts. Plus its in widescreen unlike the dvd that was only released full with a crappy stereo sound. This at least is in SURROUND SOUND. All the extras from the DVD have been cycled over from the dvd. Good for the upgrade! Its interesting how much was missed from the full screen disc.
5,Rules of Attraction,Rules of Attraction that I ordered was delivered in good time. It is in good physical condition. I haven't yet viewed it so I can't speak of the DVD itself. I am happy with this purchase!
5,"Perfect, only thing I miss is his brother","This is one of those movies I would descripe as a classic cult movie. Filming, directing, music, story... Everything is perfect.There will always be someone that can't appreciate excellent films such as this one. My advice to them is : Go home and watch the piano and the crying game... The scene where a girl cuts here wrist is beatiful and terrible at the same time. Isn't the purpose of watching movies to free some emotions?? Well it is exactly what this film does. I will buy this dvd the second it is released, and I advice you to do the same!!!"
4,And it's a story that might bore you.,"How do I begin to review this film? Perfectly shot. Perfectly written. Perfectly adapted. Perfectly edited. Perfect soundtrack. The absolute best thing about this movie is that if you want to know little behind the scenes tidbits on the story, you can READ THE BOOK!The best book by Bret Easton Ellis, in my opinion, is The Rules of Attraction. And I think it's the best film of the early 2000's. The reason I give this DVD/Blu Ray 4 stars rather than 5, is due to the lack of any special features beyond a commentary. I know that this film was originally over 2 hours long and I want that extra material! I'd love an uncut release of this movie, but until then, this will be just fine.I highly recommend this."
4,"A really dark, really good film","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I happened to catch it on Israeli television while in Tel Aviv on business. Having nothing better to do I left it on, fully expecting to be treated to a one and a half hour festival of hedonism and the celebration of hedonism.What I found instead was hedonism but additionally an honest portrayal of the consequences of that lifestyle.It amazes me that some of the people who give this film one, two, or three stars criticize it for its hedonism and completely and totally fail to recognize that the film is anything but a celebration of it. If anything it's a warning to young people that a life lived in the service of the self can and often does lead to pain, anguish and even death."
1,Rules of Making Me Vomit,"Awful, terrible, dusgusting. It takes a LOT to offend me, and I found this movie offensive. I loved seeing Dawson in a gay love scene, though. I felt terribly sorry for Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), but hated the rest of the characters. The movie really has no plot - it's just a bunch of shock-value scenes and special effects throughout. Parents, don't be fooled by the all-star teenage-crush cast - this is not a movie for the teen set by any means."
1,YUCK!,"WARNING: This book looks good. It has an interesting plot. Do not be fooled by its 4.5 star rating on Amazon.com. Side effects may include nausea, boredom, and downright depression for wasting time.This book is very slow, boring and has terrible writing! I mean, there's this one part that is something like: ""The deserted place was empty."" COME ON!!!Do not read this book!"
3,Sounds more like Gloria Estefan of the Portuguese,"I have Nelly's earlier cds. She has a great voice and feel for her music. I was so surprised by this. This a very commercial mix of dance, Spanish Latin with Shakira thrown in. Very teen orientad with the safe soft rap. Change some of the sound a tiny bit, and you have Gloria Estefan. The dance songs like Afraid, Maneater, and Promiscuous will cater to teen pop, the ethnic salute (in Portugese)like No Hay Iqual is a nod to Shakira and Estefan. Of course, this became a hit. Not for me, heard this before."
2,Another Timbaland Project,"Timbo's future-shock sound that he's been cranking out since 1997 is still here, this time applied to formerly folk-rock-esque Nelly Furtado. It's enough of a shame that Timbo applied the same trick he's been pulling to Nelly, and that she's allowed herself to transform into some kind of disco queen (worst makeover since Jewel), but the fact that ""Do It"" is stolen from a Finnish independent techno artist Tempest without credit seals the deal. Catchy, but nonetheless played out before it was ever released."
2,"There's more to life than sex, Nelly","I love the music, but I'm sick of listening to pop music about sex. That's all artists sing about as if this is all life is about. Weak lyrics is a sign of a weak and insecure artist."
2,Boring,"Poor Ms. Furtado can't seem to come close to her ""Whoa, Nelly"" CD. I found this CD to be mostly boring, and do not recommend it."
3,I miss Ole' Nelly,"So, I have had this CD for about a month now and I've listened to all I can. I love Nelly and especially her old stuff, when she first became popular. This CD however made it sound like she was doing what other people told her to do. I mean I like the hip pop and dance songs, but then she sings a slower song and it just sucks!! Anyway, I like most of her songs and I hope she keeps on keepin on, this CD was just okay for me."
3,"Not perfect, but still good","Eclectic singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado goes totally commercial on her third album Loose. Hip Hop-tinged ""Promiscuous"" is the standout track here, of course, as it's huge right now. ""Wait For You"" is just as likable, though not as listenable. The most Whoa, Nelly!-like song here is ""All Good Things,"" though the bland ""In God's Hands"" almost makes for just as good of a listen. It's not perfect and isn't going to appeal to many of her dedicated fans, but Furtado's Loose is still a record worth listening to."
2,Worthy for my niece.,I saw Nelly Furtado as a fresh new artist her last CD. I borrowed it from my niece and I was looking forward to her new CD. I've only listened to it once then offered it to my niece. She didn't want it.
1,Absolute Garbage,"This CD is a great example of what happens when good musicians meet record companies with tanking sales: they want mass appeal rather than quality. Nelly's first 2 CD's had a smooth sound to them - Folklore was definitely above average for a modern-day artist. Her first album sounded exceptional as well - it was music that had some thought behind it. When I read that Folklore was a disappointment as far as sales went, I knew we were in trouble - boy was I right! This CD has terrible lyrics, too much synthesizer, and too many pop beats - it sounds like all the other garbage floating around since 2000. I'm very disappointed and saddened to see a modern-day artist that had so much potential sell out. I can only hope that perhaps she will make an independent album with what she wants to produce, and not what some skill-less producer thinks will sound good on a dance floor."
3,loosen me up,this cd i found something of a reason to say buyer beware sometimes you my surprise yourself not that this is a great piece of music but a very listenable one and one i say if you get the chance to hear this cd do and you too can be plesantly surprised.
5,Nelly is Fantastic,I would recommend this CD to everyone. Nelly Furtado is an excellent singer and entertainer.
4,Surprisingly good,"It takes a lot for me to buy a CD and when I finally bought this one, I was nicely surprised! I like a lot of the songs on it! Usually I just like a few and the rest I never listen to. Most of the songs on this are pretty good. I like how they are varied, one is almost gypsy-like, then another is more pop-like, and so on. She is very versatile and not afraid to take risks. I didn't think I liked her when her first CD came out, but now I am coming around. :)"
2,I love Nelly but this album fell flat.,"For the most part I love Nelly Furtado. But, this album has only 2 really good songs. They are ""Maneater"" & ""Promiscuos"". The rest of the album fell flat. There's some talk in the beginning of some songs and at the end. I know some artists think by adding their personal touch of talking will entice others to love their project even more. I guess in the end, Nelly's album ended up like all the others. They entice us with 1 or 2 cover songs and then they hope we won't mind all the other bad songs. If you like Nelly Furtado but only want to own good songs, buy the singles which will have the remixes. If you have a lot of money and don't mind wasting it, go ahead and pick up this album. I think I just made a mistake and bought this album without sampling the whole thing. That's why I gave it 2 stars. Someday I will learn.A music fan"
2,I expected this album to be much better....,"I expected this album to be much better than it really was. I attribute the rating of this album mostly to the production. It seems as if the songwriters and producers put as little work as possible into this one as was required to get a paycheck. With the exception of a couple songs, I will be much more careful about which whole albums I will buy again. I loved Nelly Furtado's first two albums, but this one just didn't do it. The soul is gone. The producers here are hoping that the sound of a couple analog synthesizers will put substance into this album and they are just dead wrong. The albums here are maturing backwards... listen to all the tracks before you buy."
3,Vintage Carl Reiner,"Okay, so it is dated material. I saw it years ago and it was funny then because the cold war made Russians great targets for humor.Cast is loaded with notable comedians such as Winters and others. The movie is not as funny today as it was then, yet is still a good laugh not only at the movie's content but at our own cultural biases at the time.Not a must have, just fun to have."
3,Some Russians have seen it,"It's better to entitle it ""Russians are coming, Russians are coming"" without the article, i.e. most Russians would prefer to stay at home. Some of them enjoy watching all your 'western' moovies about 'Russians'. Actually, Russian films about the west are far more true to life. Your russophobia is so steadfast and everlasting that it seems funny:))Recomenduetsia vsem lyubiteliam amerikanskogo folklora:) Osobenno, posmotrite, kak oni imitiruyut nashih, nu i konechno - ih razgovor. Neuzheli nel'zia bylo produblirovat'? Tak, serovatoye kintzo."
5,A revolutionary worldview for Americans,"Along with the original series of Star Trek which premiered the same year of 1966, this movie formed the basis for a paradigm shift for many Americans, at least for those of us young enough to have our minds changed through popular culture. As a 12 year old, I can remember what an effect this movie had on me when it was released. I grew up in the Cold War era. My house had a bomb shelter and we practiced routines in school in preparation for a Soviet nuclear attack. This film was a revelation to me--suggesting that the citizens of Soviet Russia might be human beings with whom I had something in common, rather than being mere minions of an ""evil Empire."" I am happy to say that the movie has held up remarkably well, unlike some others from the same era. This movie must have been risky to make at the time--would that we should have more such risk-takers!"
4,"The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming","I enjoyed this movie very much. It was cute and funny. It definitely shows what the frame of mind was in the US when the movie was made, with the Cold War going on."
4,Great find,My wife and I stumbled upon this movie one day last summer while flicking through channels. Every since then we find ourselves quoting lines from it. It's a great comedy film that is genuinely funny!! We can't wait to own it for ourselves instead of wishing it to be on TV!
3,Just not the same...,"I bought this movie based on my chilhood memories of it (mistake). Now that I have seen it again I sure was disapointed. On paper it sounds great...all the right actors...funny plot...you get it. Unfourtianitly the movie falls flat on it's face--Johnathan Winters was so briliant in Mad, Mad, World--but his performance here is simply embarassing. I have to say just skip this one!"
1,The Russians are Coming,Your service was excellant. The movie we ordered for a relative who could not find it. Why ; I have no idea as I did not care for the movie when it was new. We will be ordering other items from you in the future and are very satisfied with your availabilty of movies etc.
2,Is this really the Roxxi we know and love?,"Roxxi is my favorite Bratz doll. She is the bagirl of the lot, and a sometimes goth, sometimes punk fashion rebel. So understandably I was shocked to see this rather mild Roxxi princess look. Being punky doesn't mean you can't be a princess, but the doll's make-up is so ""cute"" that it's ridiculous. Also, her hair and eye color changed from the original model. Roxxi has violet-blue eyes, with dark auburn-red hair. But here she has aqua blue eyes and simple brown hair! It's disappointing, to say the least. If you really want a Roxxi doll, buy the Bratz Tresures edition.Erm, that is all.CHOW! And don't touch the sushi.XOXOXO,Roxanne"
5,Russell Pullover Sweatshirt,"My husband and son both wear Russell Sweatshirts and they last wash after wash. Russell is a better brand of sweatshirt, thick, fits well and roomy. I have tried the cheaper sweatshirts and they don't last as long or fit as well."
2,okay sweatshirt (if you're short and fat),"I am an average size guy, about 5'10"" 165 lbs. I ordered a size large of this sweatshirt. The length of it is too short (after washing it, it barely reaches the bottom of my belt in the back). And the sleeves and width are too large. I think the sleeves are large enough to fit my thighs. And it is big enough around to fit two of my torso (but not two necks, since the neck hole is pretty small).I have another hooded sweatshirt from a brand sold on Amazon. It is a size large, and the proportions are more reasonable.Also, the first time I washed this sweatshirt, the stitching around the pocket started unraveling. Pretty lame."
4,dull shadows and bright lights,"Harris is variably gifted. From the highest plain of genius to hack work--however professionally wrought--few were as comfortable in older forms than Harris. The Quintet is highly touted, but it is a portion of the violin sonata that touches the heart. Once in a while in Shoatakovch as he is meandering along, an exquisite melody emerges as if the composer just awakened to it. Harris does this sometimes. In his choral work 'We Know that Susan Takes her Studies lightly' for female choir and piano you have a lovely from the heart sweet caprice, thus Harris has the beauty of song within his heart and it is certainly worth waiting for--patiently I must add-- for much of his choral work is not of the best quaity in terms of creative essence--however he always demonstrates a consummate well schooled professionalism.If you would want to take a relaxed and pleasant promenade with Harris, then hear this violin sonata, you won't be sorry."
5,Great item and plenty of smace to hide goodies.,"I love this unit, it has plenty of space to put your blade servers and hardware. for those pieces of hardware that does not take much depth space, you can pile them together and use that backspace to put a cabinet mount unit on the backside to hide your goodies from your family. that's where I keep all my snacks. to them it looks like a computer console of junk with lights, but in the rear side is where the real goodies are."
5,Great enclosure,"Perfect size, has enough space on back side to put compartments for storage as well. The rear has two swing doors. Made with enough space for ventilation. Might purchase another for other location if accounting gives me money."
3,common sense,"The book was somewhat informative and helpful but I felt several of the exercises were things my toddler and I already do. If anything, the book is a good reminder of things we should be teaching our toddlers and children instead of parking them in front of a t.v. all day."
5,stikfas-best posable figurine,"These figures, called Stickfas,are fully posable and come with a buttload of weapons. You can pose them in any way and make action poses too. They are so fun and all, but they don't have a playset, to make a fight scene. So therefore I give this product a 9/10."
5,A feast for the eyes of any fire truck enthusiast!,"I recommend this book to anyone who even likes fire trucks a little bit. It has over 85 awesome color pics of all different kinds of fire trucks in every color imaginible. I especially enjoyed the section on special units. Also, there are sidebars covering such topics as quints and squad companies. Also, if you like this book, be sure to check out ""Fire Trucks In Action"" by George Hall- They're both great books!"
4,Everything you need to know about fire trucks.,It has Everything you need to know about fire trucks and their rescue missions. A very informational book with lots of pictures.
2,Buy the green stuff instead -_-,"It doesn't seem to matter how much I press the edge in to the surface, I just canNOT get a clean paint edge with this tape. It was only super important to have a perfect line on one wall (accent color), and I can't even get that one wall out of this tape. I've done touch up about 4 times, and it's not even a big wall!The only reason I didn't give 1 star is that this is the ""delicate surfaces"" tape, and it DID come off more readily than the regular blue tape. I'm working over fairly old molding in places, and the regular tape left gunk, and took up the finish - this kind did NOT damage the molding at all."
2,Inherit the wind,I havent read much of this book but I dont like it so fare. My teacher just said it doesnt have enough pages so screw it freshout
5,Great series!,"This is the fourth book I have read from Lee Child in the Jack Reacher series. They are very engaging and well written. The lead character is smart, resourceful, strong and ruthless when he has to be to put down the bad guys. He also has a heart and the character descriptions, interactions and dialogue all feel real when it could easily devolve into a comic book style. I have enjoyed his writing style and character development and plan to read the entire series over time. I can understand why they are so popular."
2,The only disappointing Jack Reacher novel,"I've loved all of the Jacker Reacher novels... until this one. Don't get me wrong, the story reads great, as always. However, the ending is completely disappointing. I don't want to give it away, but it's based on a stereotyped, way-overused, and completely false quasi-science that is impossible to happen the way it does in the book. When you see this plot in a TV show, you know that the writers are running out of ideas, as they always seem to eventually use this one. I expected better from Lee Child. Perhaps others can overlook that (or don't realize it's completely unreal), but it ruined the book for me.So go ahead and read it if you can't stand the thought of missing a Jack Reacher novel, but if you're new to the series, please start with another one, like The Persuader or Without Fail, or at the beginning with The Killing Floor."
4,"Running Blind was a great read, I wish Lee Child was more prolific.","This is a typical Jack Reacher story, that's why I enjoyed it so much. Convince him to write more often."
4,good read,"unusual story line, interesting characters. fast moving, as all his books are. One of his best, that I have read."
5,Great read,"This Jack Reacher/Lee Child book kept me reading long past my bedtime.I usually read action/mystery/thrillers, this book stands up along side my other faves from Baldacci/Flynn."
3,Probably my last.,"I have now read the first four of the Jack Reacher stories. I very much enjoyed the first. The second was not great. Not bad, either. The third and, finally, the fourth have pushed my tolerance level to the limit. I strongly wished the author would do more research before he puts ""stuff"" in the books. Nothing intolerable by itself, but they start to add up. For example, Jeep is copyrighted trade name and does not apply to all SUVs. (book three) There is a difference between the US Army, Air Force, and Marines. One cannot use the names and commands interchangeably. I found the portrayal of the FBI somewhat distasteful and not realistic. (book four) Artistic license is certainly expected. They should, however, try to stay within reasonable limits. After researching the author's background, I suppose a greater level of ""bad America"" conspiracy theory is expected, but I am not obligated to read it."
3,Running Blind,"i have just finished reading this title and given it only 3 stars due to its printing format. The book was good as one has come to expect from Mr Child. The story was taught and one was in suspense as to who was the killer right to the last chapter. But it did not have any chapters, this was confusing as one would be reading one scene with one set of characters when half way down the page the scene completly changed and we were having conversations with other characters! If this was a cost saving excercise it did not work!"
2,Unbelievably Unbelievable,"This novel had its elements, but the basic premise was so preposterous that it undid any good aspects. The ""bad guy"" all but acquired magic powers in order to carry out his crimes. (In the interest of not giving away the plot, there are some misleading terms in this review.) If this sort of thing was possible, people would be using it all the time in criminal activity, but they aren't -- because it's not possible.In short, I didn't believe anything about this novel. The author must have been in a desperate mood during its composition -- even Reacher's breakup was abrupt and not well explained. I wanted to read the whole series, having started out with the first one. This one makes me want to abandon the project entirely."
2,Disappointed,"I usually enjoy reading the Reacher series of books. But this one disappointed me. I know it is a fiction, but Reacher's relationship with the FBI was unrealistic - a bit of a stretch. The ending was weak. This book could have been much shorter."
3,Another far-fetched Reacher,"You'll enjoy this one if you can willingly suspend your disbelief. A plus: you'll never guess ""who done it."" But the plot is based on an incorrect premise and the author hopes that most readers will not know that the premise is incorrect. Also, in building suspense, and he does that, he gets a little tedious. Prose like, ""She walked out of the house, unlocked her car, opened the door, got in, closed the door and locked it. Started the car, put it in reverse, etc. etc."" You think, ""Yeah, yeah, get on with it."" Reacher comes to a major life-style decision in this one. Read ""Tripwire"" first, as awful as it is."
1,RIP OFF!!!!!,"I was very disappointed when I realized the book, ""The Visitor"" was the same book as ""Running Blind"". Where is the integrity and honesty? They should be ashamed. Will make me think twice before buying another Lee Child book!!!!"
1,Shame on you Amazon,Repackaged with the non-US title - You should pull this from sale since it the same as Running Blind. Shame on you for peaking my interest. I almost ordered it - wonder how many you will sell to folks who have already read it under the Running Blind title. Do the right thing and make it more plain that it is the non-US version. The book is great - the one star ratings is because I hate that Amazon seems to be attempting to mislead us.
2,Boardering on silly,A disappointing end to the book. The plot built well but ended in an almost farcicle fashion. Left me with a feeling akin to many 3rd series TV dramas where the plot just gets silly.
3,Business as usual,"This was a good Jack Reacher but not the best I have read. Child used too much, in my opinion, contrived misdirection to keep the reader quessing. I say contrived because they really added nothing to the story but to throw the reader off the scent. The sections about the mysterious person in the pentagon is my main point. Other than that it was a good read and held my attention to the end but has made me a little reticent to jump right into the next one."
2,Read them all and they all seem the same,"Jack Reacher is the same violent loner that he was in the first, second, third... twenty-third book. Just too much violence and the end of the book is just as silly as the end of all of the Lee Child books. Lee Child writes so well, why don't the stories live up to the writer."
1,Horrible,"I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago, absolutely loved it and got completely hooked. Just finished Reacher #5 and about to download 6.If you ask me, the first two are stunning (5* masterpieces), #3 is good but not as good (different feel to it but still interesting, 3-4*), but this was horrible. The CIA came across as completely unbelievable, the 'twist' was visible a mile off, and the whole thing was based on a flawed premise (SPOILER: hypnosis just doesn't work like that).Five was better but also flawed (3*?).The first two were so good that I am going to plod on, however. Hope the series gets back on track.[this reminds me of the John Rain books, where the first two are stunning and then the whole thing gets tired fast once he leaves Japan and gets his annoying sidekicks...]"
4,One of the better Reacher novels,"For me, Running Blind is amongst Lee Child's best Reacher novels. It was an exciting book, the plot was good and I really liked the charactrs. Usually, I am able to solve the Reacher novels quite early but this wasn't the case with Running Blind."
3,Uneven Pace,"Lee Child spins wonderful tales, convoluted and popping with curious and intriguing characters. his failing is he lacks pace. Long descriptive paragraphs are fine as he gets his plot going. He does them well. But when the action gets perking along he seems to forget the drama and instead lessen by long, needless descriptions that do nothing but clog up the pace. In Running Blind, he also makes one of his few factual mistakes. He has his hero Reacher say: ""You ever been to Israel? Women in the front line there too...."" I don't know where he got this mistaken idea. Women in the Israel Defense Force serve as secretaries and other noncombat roles, usually as the concubines of the officers."
2,A bit too obvious,"My sole and only problem with this book is that fact that it's a big mystery...that I figured out less than a third of the way into the book. All you have to do is ask yourself the right question about what seems to be going on at the right time, and both the ultimate motive and the perpetrator are obvious.Otherwise, the book is competently written and the protagonist engaging. Child also steps away from the previous book where he gave Jack a wish-fulfillment ending that threatened to remove all of his character."
2,Too bad about the ending,"Although Child takes the reader on an interesting ride that keeps him from putting the book down, much of the book is a bit over the top. After exciting the reader throughout the book, Child disappoints with an unrealistic half - baked ending resulting in a poor rating."
2,Not the best Reacher,"I'm a big Reacher fan, and if you're going to read them all - read this one. If you're just looking for a single book to read, and heard about how awesome Reacher is (which he is) pick another one."
3,Jack Reacher. What else needs to be said?,"I liked that JR came to gripes with himself. I didn't like how, a little too unrealistically, he is able to bend and break the law right in front of the police. Its one thing when he does it in other novels when there are no authorities around to do something about it, but in this novel, they are RIGHT THERE. Too much for me. Otherwise a good story."
2,"Improbable, impossible, implausible","Hoping for an exciting read with this, my first Lee Child mystery. Unfortunately you don't always get what you hoped for. Every aspect of this story is poorly thought out. I'm as willing as the next person to suspend reality for the sake of an exciting storyline, but this is too implausible to be ignored. Buy a John Sandford novel instead."
4,Another trap to buy the same book twice,Twice doing my frequent Amazon purchases I have purchased the same book or cd twice due to possibly? double clicking in error.The refund is not enough to justify the hassle and money to return.Thanks to all the CONSIDERATE reviewers here I avoided another double.
4,consistent Jack Reacher book,"A good read, not one of the best but consistent. Jack Reacher character works to get the truth out of the situation."
1,disappointing,"This book falls far short of other books, such as Tripwire, which i could not put down. The book, Running Blind, is spongy, weak, lots of gaps of what is certainly not even close to possible reality. Hope the next one I read by him is up to his previous quality."
3,Interesting twist,"I enjoyed the book. It is an exciting and intriguing twist on the serial killer genre, though I think the book went on a little too long. Perhaps that's because I figured out who the killer was fairly early in the book, and because there was no real investigating going on until late in the book.I do agree with the readers who find Child's portrayal of the FBI less than credible. I'm perfectly willing to accept that there are some corrupt agents, but could the entire agency really be this stupid? Nothing they do makes any sense. If they really thought ... was the killer, they wouldn't hire him as a consultant. If they want him as a consultant, why don't they listen to anything he says? Why not just ask him to help (for a modest stipend?) why threaten his girlfriend?"
4,a great underrated classic,"thanks to my mom, she gave me good taste in films. I think this was the first movie I saw that made me love Peter Sellers. He was a brillant, comical actor. the movie takes place in the late 60s in New York and it centers in on 2 preteen girls that have an innocent crush on Sellers charater, Henry Orient. they follow him around and drive him crazy...but in a good, funny and innocent way. its a fun, cute, sad, silly romp of a film that pleasantly surprised me!"
2,the world of henry orient,The sound quality of the movie is very poor. No matter how loud you make it you can't seem to understand what they are saying.
3,motown meets house,"I'm not so sure that I like this double cd really - it's not the music I'm into, and the closest I could describe it would be 'motown meets house'. It's the only CD in my collection that I'd like to sell to somebody who's into this music."
5,Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ,"This is a great book if you are interested in building J2EE applications and want to link to an Oracle database but don't want to learn the complicated JDBC API. It isn't an 'intro to programming' book like so many out there; it is, however, perfect for object-oriented programmers who are wanting to learn java with a quikness. Finally, a great SQLJ book has emerged!"
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"I'm an omnivore. However, my husband is vegan, so all of the meals we make at home are vegan. As a result, I own many vegan/vegetarian cookbooks, and this one is by far my favorite. Virtually every recipe I've tried has been absolutely delicious. My husband practically bribes me to make the Ultimate Shepherd's Pie. Mom's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies are heavenly. The consistency of the dough is unusual (compared to traditional chocolate chip cookies), so I was skeptical the first time I made them. But they turned out great. The seitan recipe is so simple and so tasty. I've made a few of the dishes for my meat-eating family, and my mom has even asked for the recipes! There are many recipes I have yet to try because I now have so many favorites that it's hard not to keep making the same things over and over. I highly recommend this cookbook for vegans as well as non-vegans looking to cut back on their meat and dairy consumption."
4,Best vegan cookbook I have,"This cookbook is a great one to have on hand just to flip through when you don't know what to make for dinner. Most of the recipes I've tried have come through like a charm. However, a couple are flops (the ""sour cream"" is so not right!).The main thing that I like about this cookbook is that, unlike so many vegan cookbooks, its recipes don't rely on nutritional yeast. So for vegans who don't like the stuff - you won't find it much here!But, it is more complex than a basic 'how to make toast' kind of cookbook. My favorite recipe is, by far, the ginger-spiced cashew scones. mmmm.amy"
3,"Lots of recipes, just not that good","I bought Vegan Planet as a gift for my girlfriend after flipping through a few recipes at a bookstore. It looked good, and there were lots of things to try.Problem is, a lot of the recipes aren't very good. Example: the ""Three Bean Dal"" (page 285) makes a pretty good chili, but certainly isn't Dal. The obligatory chocolate chip cookie recipe (page 510) uses way too much liquid (maple syrup and corn oil) resulting in a cookie that has a hard time setting up, and whose texture just isn't right.There are some good finds in here, but nothing that's knocked my socks off. If you need a semi-encyclopedic book that'll have a recipe for almost anything, this could work. If you're looking for books with good recipes that will guide you in new directions, look elsewhere."
4,Lots of fun recipes,"Lots of recipes containing soy/meat substitutes. I wasn't thrilled with that aspect (gave me a tummy ache), but I can't say they aren't good. A really great helper when I started my journey into being vegan."
5,great cookbook,"I'm vegan and really liked this cookbook but I feel like anyone who enjoys cooking would appreciate this book. The recipes not only make food that is so good I want to cry, but it is healthy food and no animals had to be slaughtered to create it. Definitely gets a thumbs up from me."
1,Mislead,"Not only is this not the original recordings, its not the original artist! The group is called The House Of Fun All-Stars which is (1) group not various Amazon!"
1,not true,"I just received this product, is not like on the picture, three extra parts are missing.Also, Made in Hungary?"
5,"any interest in lbos, this is your guide","KKR was the first name I heard while researching the Private Equity marketplace for a college paper. It also became the name heard mostly afterwards and rightfully so. Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George Roberts are obviously extremely smart and confident guys, fortunately the book exhibits moments of vulnerability; which is helpful for any financial entrepreneur. The only shortfall is that the book isn't longer. I was excited while reading some of the chapters, keep in mind that this is a finance book not the Lord of the Rings. This book is terrific. Enjoy"
3,educational but rediculously one-sided,"A very education and interesting book. You will definitely learn about the LBO market.Don't expect to read anything negative about KKR. Of course, its nowhere near anything as self-gratifying as Eisner or Bloomberg's books.All in all, a good book."
1,IT WONT FIT PONTIAC G6 2006,"I bought this item going by what Amazon recommended. Don't go by what Amazon is recommending you, go by its written in catalogs or consult a car stereo technician and save yourself time and money. I have a 06 Pontiac G6 and this won't fit."
1,don't waste your time or money,This does not fit my 2002 chevy as listed.What a waste of my time and money.At least it was cheap.but now i have to go get the right one and my truck is torn apart.I wish i could leave 0 stars
2,Be careful when buying,"This connector is not even close for a 2004 Chevy Blazer. Wiring with the harness was easy to hook up, but not all of the wires were not stripped and ready to go."
5,Great,The bag looks baby blue on the internet but its really green but it looks nice still. My niece loves it.
2,Well....not quite what I anticipated,"This bag was going to be for me to use at college, and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that. It is more made for elementry to middle school kids. So luckily I have a little sister to give it to, but otherwise, I'm pretty disappointed."
2,"No, I am not an 8 year old kid...","So i bought this backpack because I needed to keep my books somewhere so I could carry things in my hands. I am 17 and a senior in High School. I ordered on the 21st or 22nd of December[I know I got the rest of my items before Christmas] and got the bag on the 6th of January. which was a drag.I got the bag at the material is pretty lousy, the straps are stiff and worst of all... its really small. I am 5'7"" and this bag looks like a little kid's backpack. I just gotta say that if you are older than 10 or 11, find a new backpack or you will just look like a grown person who stole some little helpless kid's backpack."
2,a little disappointed,"The material for the body of the bag is very thin and I'm worried it won't last me through the school year. It's not a comfortable fit with the weight of my texts no matter where the straps are adjusted. I admit it looks really cute and you can't beat the price, but if i were to see that bag in a store where i could touch it and feel the material, i would not have purchased it - even despite how inexpensive it was."
4,Great backpack for college students!,The product is simple and such a classic. Will never go out of style!! Durable and easy to use/clean. Highly recommend for college students. Jansport also provides a lifetime guarantee for their products. Got it fast from the seller!
1,Disgusted,"This product is cheap and the stitching was all over the place. It was made overseas and it shows. I will never buy from this company again. It's doubtful this thing will last 3 weeks as it's so thin and flimsy. I would like to warn anyone who is considering buying one of the Jansport bags online. Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there. I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first. Either way, it made my 7 year old happy, and i'm sure she will be upset that it has torn up within a month. Buyers BEWARE."
2,weak sauce,"the shoulder strap is already broken and it has only been 6 weeks. its a weak backpack, considering that i put it to gentle use"
3,"Nice, but thin material - but holds up well","Bought this for my daughter, she liked the design. However, the material is very thin, and not what I expected in the Jansport name. While it makes the bag light to carry, I doubt it will last very long.Update on 12/2009 - the bag has held up very well, despite my initial concerns about how light weight it is."
2,nice bag but straps are cheap,the straps would loosen by itself when carring the bag on your back.... i dont like it. Also the material is flimsy. but we all know that jansport lasts long...
3,Cute but not a good buy,"This backpack is cute, but it is not really a good purchase. I have washed it a few times, and now the inside of the fabric has started to peel away. Also, it doesn't hold any shape, so it kind of hangs down instead of staying up on your back. The fabric is thin and the quality is so-so. If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with some shape to it with more padding and machine wash capability. This would be more suitable for a day at the beach than for carrying books."
2,Janesport backpack,"I bought this backpack for my 12-year old Goddaughter who was visiting from Brazil. She wanted this particular brand because it happens to be in fashion down there. However, I fail to understand why it costs so much considering the poor quality of the material and the overall product. I can buy a much much better backpack, padded, strongly made and with lots of compartments making it much more useful, for a lot less money. I think the product is way overrated and unless your kid wants it for the ""fashion"" aspect of it, I'd look for something else of better quality."
5,excellent price,I needed this simple old school backpack for use as a toddler diaper bag. this works perfectly and was a great price!
3,A little thin,"This is for my niece who loves Jansport but compared to other Jansport backpack I've purchased before, the material seems thinner. It is also smaller than the usual backpacks from Jansport. Thumbs-ups though for the print which is cool!"
5,"Excellent product, horrible delivery time",The backpack i received was better than i expected it to be but it took over a week for it to get here when i was told that i t would take only two days.i was extremely dissatisfied with the time it took for this to be delivered.
4,Out of stock but SUPER helpful and friendly!!!,"The bag I initially ordered was out of stock becuase their inventory was off - at first I was really upset because I really wanted that color. However, they worked with me and got me a great backpack that I was very happy with!"
3,small but adequate,"I bought this backpack for my daughter, who is in high school. I suspected it would be too small, but she insisted on getting it. The backpack is very small--about the right size for a first grader. Since my daughter doesn't usually need to carry her textbooks around with her, the small size has been OK, but I'll caution other people not to buy this pack if you need to carry more than two textbooks, plus notebooks, etc, at a time."
4,Overall Satisfied,"I was expecting the bag to be larger than it was. It is smaller than ordinary backpacks, but since I will be in college this fall and not carrying as many books, it is not an issue. I like the color, the quality, and the speed of shipping.The only complaint I have is that it does not have a drink carrier on the side.Thank you Amazon for your cheap prices! :)"
5,"great product, durable",Great backpack. Durable and has plenty of room for materials. I use it to bring books lunch and activities to my job and have used it for travel as well.. Love the color options.
4,jansports backpack,"I like the fact the you can put stuff in it, and you could also wear it on your back. I prefer the one-strap because it makes you look a lot cooler."
5,Law373,"Great backpack. My daughter ordered the hit pink and got lime green monogram. Big hit, well made, great price! Love it."
4,Good for kids,"My daughter loves this backpack, because it is not heavy, and more spacious inside of bag. And she told me it was easy to put in or out from her locker at school. She wants to buy one more..."
5,Love the color!,"I saw this color on a jansport in the store, but it wasn't the style I wanted. Found it here online and they delivered it within 2 business days! Very happy with my purchase!"
1,This was just the stupidest movie,I can't believe you people are actually *TRYING* to sell this s**t
5,"Hey Dimita, I thoughtchu's gonna play with my frog...","I felt the need to write a review for Class Act after reading the ones that tore it apart. This movie is not only FULL of brilliant one liners, it also holds a pretty funny story that's easy to follow and laugh at about 2 students (obviously kid and play) who's transcripts get switched on the first day of highschool making the bad kid and the smart kid reverse rolls. I guess its for the type of person that has a good sense of humor and can see that it was meant to be ""stupid"" funny and not aiming for a movie award. Kid and Play may have vanished years ago, but anytime i see this movie on TBS, it cracks me up and i actually came to amazon today to see if you can buy it on DVD because i definitely would."
3,a hope full wish,"Knorr/Lipton Rice Sides, Herb & Butter, 5.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)A long time ago you had a very very good product that was known as herb & butter rice ( NO SIDES-pasta), and it could be used alone or to be mixed with ground meat, bell peppers,& tomatoes to create unstuffed bell peppers. Then some one decided to IMPROVE!!? the mix by adding pasta, and it is just not as good, but it is the only way I can get the rice that I like. PLEASE PLEASE go back to the pastaless rice. Thanks in advance"
3,average rating.,there are a number of nice steps taught here except the instructions in text which pops up on the screen are distracting and time consuming.
1,Known (but not advertised) conflict,"These DLINK wireless adapters have a known conflict with Sound Blaster cards. I tried to install one in my Gateway with Win XP and it would not work, after the third call to tech support they informed me there was a known conflict with Sound Blaster audio and told me to take out the Sound Blaster. Now I ask you what good is a silent computer???"
1,Get used to the Blue Screen,"I have had trouble with this piece of hardware since I installed it. I went through numerous conversations with D-Link support trying to identify the issue, installing different driver versions and none of them have worked. Don't buy it, if you want my advice."
2,Snipes can do better!,"This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in. Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy, a very typical character in these James Bond style movies of one man takes on dozens, and wins. The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin. The film centers around the concept that the U.N. is trying to build itself up as a major world power by framing people for the assasinations of heads of state. The movie does not spend enough time to develop this plot and thus leaves the viewer distracted from the action. Throughout the movie, you are presented with a small list of people for the ""who-done-it"" style ending, which I'm sorry to say was very predictable. Overall, this film is worth watching on cable, but I personally would not pay the money to rent or buy it."
1,Pro U.N. nonsense,"I saw The Art of War about 1 year ago ,and I was verydisheartened by what I saw .The U.N. has always beenan enemy of freedom .It is a bastion of totalitarianismand socialism .The U.N. was founded by one-worlders,such as Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White ,who were bothexposed as Soviet Agents .One of the U.N.'s SecretaryGenerals ,Kurt Waldheim ,was a World War II Nazi .TheArt of War portrays the U.N. in a positive light ,andthat is why I gave this move one star ."
2,"streep! cage!! kaufman!!! somebody wake me up, ok?","i really dont like movies that are 2-hours-long in jokes, and that is what this felt like. ive never much liked nicolas cage, and getting to see him in TWO roles doesnt do much for me. i liked chris cooper, but of course there was also the presence of the brilliant (sarcasm meter should be going bonkers here) miss streep, which in combo with cage and the glibness of the overall concept makes this one to avoid."
2,it was okay,"some parts of it were funny. i fell asleep so i had to watch it in two separate viewings. a different ""tradition of storytelling."""
1,Adaptation,"This movie was bizarre, slow moving, and disjointed. While the acting by Nicholas Cage and Meryl Streep was excellent in the parts they played, the depressing self-examination that dominated the plot was hard to follow and thoroughly unentertaining. The dark attempt at artsy comedy was absolutely disappointing and about as far from being comedic as anything I have seen."
1,Where to start?,"This movie was so slow and long. Once you finally reach the last 45 minutes, you have reached the best part of the whole movie. Just let this movie run while you are busy doing something else."
3,Another cynical Hollywood in joke,"...just like Kaufman's stunningly awful ""Being John Malkovich"", but this time, it's almost entertaining, probably moreso if you dont know what to expect here. Charlie Kaufman cant figure out how to bring a plotless novel to screen, and finds the only way to get a movie out of it is to make the movie about how he couldnt figure out how to bring the plotless novel to the screen. With a little help from his more gregarious screenwriter brother(who prefers the formulaic to Kaufman's more sensitive, off-kilter stuff), he barely manages to adapt himself and the movie. And you and I pay money so he can tell us what a lousy screenwriter and sorry human being he is. Regardless of the fact that the joke is on the viewer, I've seen worse."
2,not so fresh,"Strip away the wacky creature from the swamp, and ""Adaptation"" is nothing more than another film about writer's block and the relationship between art and life. Many others have come down this road. The Coen brothers in ""Barton Fink"". Woody Allen in ""Deconstructing Harry"". Woody Allen again in ""Bullets Over Broadway"". Federico Fellini in ""8 1/2"". So this movie's not really ""fresh"". It's not even that good. I agree with another reviewer that the Nicholas Cage character is just pathetic. Woody Allen played artsie schmos, too, but Woody at least had charisma, screen presence, and a really big sense of humor. Nic Cage has none of that. yuk. yuk. yuk."
4,Thought Provoking,"The best thing about this film is the last few minutes where ""some real action"" took place. It was pretty much what won the movie over for me. There is a dialogue I quote in a lot of conversations I have cause I found it very interesting. The film on the whole isn't something I would truly call ""worth watching"" but then again the day after I was thinking about the movie and it seemed to evoke certain new thoughts in me.Overall - 7/10Chris Cooper was good but was the role really meant for him? Nicholas Cage's role was different and substantial. The author's role was good, disliked the character. Confusing start,slow storyline, the film is absoultely non-commercial and has a lot of conviction with it."
3,Nothing great...,"While I wasn't abhorred by this movie, I also didn't find it worthy of my purchase. I don't know if it didn't capture my interests, or if it just wasn't a good movie. Sometimes the writing seems a little bit forced, and the movie moves so slow. One reviewer noted that it was a wanna-be intellectual movie, I kindof agree with that. It did seem to steal a few traits common in ""intellectual"" movies, and present them in a boring and even annoying light."
1,Hilarious!,"A bunch of (...) singing songs. Anybody who says that's not funny is obviously lying. This is the most hilarious album to come out in years! Way to go, kids!"
5,Peony: A Novel of China,"When I received the Kindle Paperwhite as a gift, I immediately looked for classics. Pearl Buck was my first choice. After reading the Good Earth I read Peony: A Novel of China. Every student from high school through college should be required to read it. Fascinating with some important life messages."
3,"The Unknown ""Levine""","Languishing in obscurity until its DVD release, this Bernard Malamud adaptation provides a fine showcase for Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte (his first screen role since 1959's ""Odds Against Tomorrow""). Czech filmmaker Ján Kadár's American debut suffers from staginess and his uncertain handling of Malamud's short story, but the actors save the day. An engaging fable, ""The Angel Levine"" is recommended for ambitious cinephiles rather than mainstream viewers."
3,Promise Unfulfilled,"Zero Mostel plays a poor schlemiel by the name of Mishkin, who is visited by a Jewish angel named Levine. Levine is played by Harry Belafonte! This certainly promises some very clever and very amusing moments. Unfortunately, the promise remains unkept. In fact, the film never really gets started. I can remember thinking what a long time it was taking to get going, and then the closing credits started to scroll; it never got going. What is particularly disappointing is that this is a film I wanted very much to like. Alas, we don't always get what we want."
2,Wish it were better,"Since I was teaching the short story I wanted to also show the film.Loved seeing young Harry Belefonte and early Zero Mostel but the film does not haveimpact of the short story and drags. The musical score is really irritating.The two main characters were actually miscast, according to the story.Karol Verson"
2,"Great Idea, Lousy Execution","I had bought this movie a few years ago and never watched it until recently.I was disappointed by the plot and by the characters, the premise itself is fascinating.The premise is that this unlikely black angel (Belafonte) comes to this suffering Jewish man (Mostel) and his wife and tries to get him to believe in the angel. The theme of a man's need to believe in something resonates.But the plot goes in a different direction, much of it is about the angel. And the language is often harsh and the movie itself resembles The Pawnbroker in its cynical and harsh view of New York life at that time.Mostel is perfect, I believe every word and action of him. Belafonte would be a great choice as the angel if the plot eliminated the earthiness and self-pitying of his character and stressed the idea of him as an angel. As for the rest of the cast, Milo O'Shea as a Jewish doctor?"
5,Ethan Frome The Man Shackled By Fate,"The Romeo and Juliet of its time, Ethan Frome is a suspenseful story about a man shackled by marriage to the lady of his nightmares, and when he finds the love of his dreams he is torn to shreds by what he should do and what he needs to do. An excerpt from the story that best summarizes his predicament is ""With the sudden perception of the point to which his madness had carried him, the madness fell and he saw his life before him as it was. He was a poor man, the husband of a sickly woman, whom his desertion would leave alone and destitute; and even if he had the heart to desert her he could have done so only by deceiving two kindly people who had pitied him."" As you can see the story has an intricately designed plot that keeps you wondering until the end."
3,"Kind of boring, but still keeps you reading...!!??","Kind of a Romeo and Juliet......I had to do an author paper on Edith Wharton, and luckily I chose to read Ethan Frome 1st--before any of her other books--or else I would'nt have read any more! It was boring, yet still fast enough to read in a few days. If you've read any other Wharton books, you're probably already scared away--don't be, this is her best."
5,Ethan Frome,Book was in great condition! Much cheaper than the school's chosen company to purchase books.
2,Depressing and boring,"This book sucks. If this was the first book by Wharton that someone has read, they probably won't read any of her others, which is totalluy wrong, because she is a great author. This particular book however, is far to depressing and boring to be on the top of anyone's list. It is so boring that sometimes you can be reading the boo, yet not taking any in, and when you ""wake up"" you find yourself lost, not knowing where you are in relation to where you left off. It is my beleif that this book probably loses most of its readers after the first few chapters."
3,Ethan Frome,"Edith Wharton's book Ethan Frome is a good book. Many people can relate to Ethan's situation of loving someone else, when they are already married to somebody. This plot is very captivating and because of this the reader connects with the characters. The characters in the story are very relatable, for example Ethan's shyness toward telling Mattie that he loved her, this relates to some guys today. To make the story more interesting Ethan should have followed through with his plans of running away to stay with Mattie. I also thought it a surprise that all three of the main characters Ethan, Zeena and Mattie ended up living together at the end of the book. I recommend this book to anyone but more toward women because its a love story."
1,The most boring book that I have ever read in my entire life,"Trust me on this one folks, this book is so boring it puts you to sleep. I had to read it for summer reading, and I HATED it! I would give this no stars if I had the chance. All it is about is a guy who's going through a midlife crisis and to releive himself, has an affair with his wife's cousin. never read this book if you don't have to. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!"
4,Good book...,This was an interesting book the person who explained it to me mad it sound realy confussing but then I read it and it made sence. Good book... interesting ending.
1,Poor quality; Unhappy,"We ordered this book for an English summer reading assignment and it fell apart the first time we picked it up. The binding was in poor condition! Not worth the $8 I spent. Also, Amazon won't send me a new one, like a private owner would...so I will think twice before I choose Amazon in the future. Not worth paying return shipping and then only getting a portion back...which is Amazon's policy. Amazon---you have an unhappy customer and I'd like you to send me a new copy to make it right!"
2,I was FORCED to read this book.,"Yeah, I had to read it for an english class, which stinks in the first place because having to pick apart every novel you read in high school will discourage any kid from reading--and I'm on the Literary Mag! I have to admit, I saw the movie before the book, just because I love Liam, who played a wonderful Ethan. This book's other characters, you know besides Ethan Zeena and Mattie, were so flat and had no point. I really didn't understand who any of the other people in the book were accept maybe their jobs in the town. With that many flat characters, how can it be interesting? Only the end is enjoyable, and then when it goes back into the author's view, it becomes (and ends) boring again. See the movie."
3,Sad Love Winter Story,"For starters, the beginning and ending of ""Ethan Frome"" were rather surprising. This story is ironic in many ways. It's based on love, yet the story itself is gloomy and depressing. This story can relate to how many humans are weak when it comes to love and life situations. I think that the plot of the story had good intentions. Yet this story was just too sad to be proclaimed as a lovely love story. The ending of the story was, in a way, kind of confusing. Yet let me not ruin it for the future readers and leave off by saying that ""Ethan Frome"" was an overall good story. It's very catchy and you become intrested into what will happen to the characters towards the ending."
2,Not my favorite,"Ethan Frome is readable today, unlike something like The Scarlet Letter, which I barely suffered through, and it may have even been half-way decent at one time, but it hasn't aged well. It's pretty much just a slow-paced, depressing romance novel that shouldn't have ever been considered as required reading, let alone chosen. You really don't have to look far to find a better choice. I will admit that the story isn't terrible, it's just not very original or intriguing to me..just kind of dull, and more than a little dated. The ending fits with the rest of the book and although it doesn't really surprise you, it doesn't make you feel cheated either. So, the book is consistent, but it's consistently underwhelming."
2,Times have changed,"When Edith Wharton wrote ""Ethan Frome,"" long, long passages of exposition were perfectly acceptable fiction. That's changed. No one who doesn't have to read this book will read it. A pity; they'll miss out on Wharton's lucid and luminous prose. But for today's reader, it's a dull, dry book."
4,A good read,"We were forced to read this book my senior year in high school. I most certainly did NOT want to read a book about the stuffy ol' supreme court! But I did... because I had to... and it turns out that it's one of my favorite books of all time. Now, 15 years later, I'm an attorney and have read the book countless times over the years. It's so interesting to read about the inner workings of the country's highest court, complete with the politics, personalities, and just outright craziness."
