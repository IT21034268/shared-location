3,Works but lot of noies,I purchased this to connect my laptop to my TV but the audio cable has a lot of inherent noise. I believe this to be a low quality one. I'm on the lookout for a good quality cable.
1,This book is just a bunch of pages ........,"Like I said, this book is just a bunch of pages put together by this Oracle people to [take] your money. If anybody tells you is good , THEY ARE LYING!. The structure of it is very confused and is not organized making it a lousy reference book. Check out other alternatives"
2,Oracle 8 DBA Handbook Is Disorganized,"I purchased this text to be used in a class I was taking. I cannot begin to express my disappointment at the way the information was so poorly organized and how few truly good examples were provided. The index was large but was a poor tool in finding information, because the index can be only as good as the information it points to. If you can buy any other text, your money will be better spent. For your reference, I am an IT Infrastructure Manager in Silicon Valley."
3,My Time - Dutch ft. Crystal Waters,"Australian CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""MY TIME"" - DUTCH feat. CRYSTAL WATERS1) Radio Edit2) Lee-Cabrera Mix3) Steve Murano Remix4) The Scumfrog's Dub2003"
1,Cheap tin,"Both of the pasta cutters broke on first use. I previously used tin cookie-cutter type things, which also broke on their first use. I was hoping this set would work better, but they fell apart immediately.The roller still works, and is probably the only tool you need. But you can get much better rollers elsewhere. And who needs another cheese grater? All in all, a waste of money."
5,Very Intense read,"This could be a Humphrey Bogart movie - the embittered pilot posted to a far away place in wartime, finding solace interacting with the locals only to find himself fighting to survive in the jungle after his plane crashes. But it is better than a movie, especially the jungle episode and the believable dialog of the various characters."
5,Perfect Fit,"For something so much cheaper than the OEM part I had low expectations. Part fit perfectly, cleared out the low pad life warning and seems like OE quality. One note: I ordered two thinking that there was one on each wheel but my car only needs one per axle. I will keep it as a spare for the next job since buying two was still cheaper by far than one from the dealer."
1,Disappointing,I thought this was tooth and nails Hangnail which is awsome but these guys say the F-word in their cd booklet and i did not even listen to the songs But I'm going to return it.
1,Short life products,"This is an Audiovox product which will not last long. It has a lot of features that were taken from RCA products, but it does not have the same electronics, which is the heart of the system. You can expect this product to last the life of the warrenty and then some part of it will stop functioning correctly and it will become junk. Do not expect any customer support from the Audiovox ""customer service"" people. You will get mis-directions, excuses, poor response time, and of course RUDENESS from their representatives. I would avoid buying any Audiovox product. It is a shame that GE moved RCA product repair to Audiovox. Excellent products should never be given to under achievers for repair. Remember Audiovox is about the sale of the product and not the customer's satisfaction with the product."
5,They All Played Ragtime,Fabulous book! Couldn't put it down. A must for any lover of ragtime music and wants to know the history.
4,Asian Pride,It's wonderful to see an asian artist make it big on the charts. I support Jocelyn and other artists in their dreams. This is a great song from a great CD.
1,Doesn't work,"Does not work. You can get it to work if you twist all the cables around, but then it stops working again shortly after. I'd say don't waste your money, but it seems that some people are getting cables that work. For less than $3 dollars it's worth a shot, but overall it's junk."
3,just ok for the price,"the male pin does not fit well to my laptop, quite loose. so suddenly the music becomes low and hear noises, but for less than $2.00, can't expect more."
2,terrible sound quality,"Picks up a crackling interference that is impossible to eliminate, no matter how I route the cable. I recommend avoiding this product."
2,Picking up some background noise,"I'm currently using these as an extension from my headphones to my TV so I can hear it over the sound of my elliptical machine without having to crank the volume. I've got a decent set of Sony workout headphones that I've never had any issue with but when I plug them into this extension and then into the headphone jack on the side of the tv, I pick up some static in the background. Seems strange given that the wiring (or at least the rubber insulation) is pretty heavy duty. In fact, I'd actually prefer a less heavy-duty wire as the weight of it tugs on my headphones and I had to find a work-around for it."
3,"I found a better option, also on Amazon.","I found a better option, also on Amazon. You have to stop interrogating your customers when they remove things from their wish lists!I use my wish list as a pre-shopping cart device. When I find an item I'm interested in, I stash it in my wish list to save time later.If you don't stop this foolishness, maybe I'll just stop shopping here! Or do I have to keep on my wish list stuff I've already bought?!I DARE you to publish this ""review."" I'm betting others will agree with me!"
2,Check out the updates,"This cable is just what I needed! It's awesome!There are, however, a few things to note:-Seems to be well-constructed (only time will tell)-Little tough to get headphone connector to go in, but no real biggy-Six feet seems to go a little longer than you may think, it's probably somewhere relative to your height (I only mention thisbecause I sometimes have a little trouble visualizing length of cables, so I hope this helps others who think the same way)Over all, I'm very well pleased. This cable seems to be worth more than a penny, but I'm not going to argue about that!UPDATE (12/12/10): This cable stopped working a few days ago. If it was touched, then all you could hear was static. If it wasn't positioned correctly, you could only hear one speaker. Obviously, I think it's a waste of money looking back since it failed."
2,50 -50,"one of the two cables was as expected, the other didn't send stereo through the cable. Tried on two systems and no joy."
1,crap completely,When i recieved them i hooked them up and they were complete crap did not work at all no static fuzz nothing tried reconnnecting nothing i ordered 2 of these and i really regret it now do not buy unless you want some cheap tiedowns for something.
2,Works... If you ALMOST plug in your headphones,"Unfortunately, the female side of this cable doesn't really connect properly. I found that if I ALMOST unplug my headphones (and yes, I've tested it with multiple headphones) I'll get sound in both ears and it works fine as long as I don't have to move around much. If I plug in to the female connector all the way (the way you SHOULD) the sound only comes out of one side of the headphones/speakers."
1,you get what you pay for!,this thing is crap. from the bat the sound on the headphones it was connected to would go in and out. I had to jiggle it to get it to work properly. but then it stopped playing the right hand side of the headphone. that took 3 months to happen. spend some more money on something that might actually work.
2,good but not great,"Well the cable is fair, but I have to force a male end and a female end together. So I wouldnt really recommend this item"
1,DEFECTIVE CABLES SHOULD NOT BE SOLD***,"Defective cables should not be sold ..... 1st, 2nd replacement and 3rd replacement were all defective.Seller blamed it on damage during shipping but sent them out the same way each time...even though I suggested packing better or putting them in a box..Don't waste your time with this product...... Seller has agreed to a refund of my 2.25 but what a waste of everyones time!!"
3,Ok for some uses but doesn't shield well,I bought this to extend my speaker line on my computer but there was a constant hiss from the speakers when I had the extension used. There was no hiss without the extension. If this is being used in places with little interference it will be good.
1,Loud as heck...?,"I replaced the builder grade tiny and loud fan with the BFQ140 - and don't notice much difference in air movement (feeling around the door, etc) and it's way louder than the previous... Reading the reviews it seems I'm not the norm - any suggestions as to what I might have done wrong? FYI: the exhaust pipe is 3"" and the fitting is 4"", so I sorta taped around it to seal - after noticing noise, I went back in the attic and checked the connections - it was extremely quiet from the top and absolutely no air was blowing out of the connections..."
3,"Good fan, cheesy finish","I installed this fan several weeks ago. Its a good bathroom fan for the price, it installs easily and is reasonably quiet. The feature which I do not like is the fit of the plastic grate that covers the fan. Its very low quality and does not fit tightly to the ceiling, theres gaps at two ends. If it does not flatten out over time, I might try warming it slightly with a heat gun."
5,Great fan for the price,"This fan seems sturdy and solid and was easy to install. We installed it from below and it was helpful to have an extra person there to hold the fan while attaching the ductwork and wiring. We had no problems come up during installation and the directions were good. The fan is not whisper quiet which is okay with us, but sounds like a normal fan. It does not vibrate or make any strange noises. We are pleased with this fan and it is an excellent value."
2,Powerful but noisy,"I bought this bath fan and installed on my basement bath. I bought this as this is a high performance abs powerful bath fan however I didn't realized that this fan is quite noisy and the design doesn't allow you to fully secure it onto your ceiling stud, thus when the fan is on iit vibrates."
5,When comes the spring,I really enjoyed this book. Lovely follow on from book 1. Well worth a read. Janette Oke certainly has a lovely writing style.
3,Anticlimactic and Boring,"I really wanted to like this book, but I thought it was incredibly boring. The first book was great, and it had an interesting plot. We were wondering if she would survive that first year teaching in the wilderness, and what would happen between Elizabeth and Wynn. I just didn't feel that same excitement in the plot in When Comes the Spring as I did in the first book. It almost felt like I was reading a diary since it all seemed to read ""I washed the dishes, then I made the fire, then I made tea, then I waited for Wynn. Wynn didn't come home so I got scared. It snowed a lot."" There wasn't much tension in the plot or twists and turns. There wasn't anything in the story line that made me want to keep reading to see what happens, and there was no real climax in the story. Overall, an OK book to read before bed, but mostly boring. I won't be reading the third."
4,Crichton Review,"Though somewhat early works of the author, they reflect a very versatile and lucid knowledge of his subject matter."
5,soul express,I was intrigued by the album ocver. But I wsa very immpressed by the Artist Mr. Standrig. It is very fine music and very nice on the ears and mind.
3,Prejudice against gay U. S. military.,"I enjoyed this book, even though I had apprehensions about the subject. This details the treatment meted out to service men and women when the U. S. military finds out they are gay. One areas that I fault the author for is the over dramatization of the hurt meted out to those gay soldiers in uniform. It did make me realize that our military turned around and kicked out many capable people from the military. When there was a war around (like Vietnam), the military would disregard a person's sexial preference. When they didn't need them, they would kick them out of the military. Also blaming a sailor for causing the accidental death of many other sailors also enraged me.Since that time, Clinton has instituted a don't ask, don't tell policy. I agree with this policy as there seems a lot of military people who don't believe in equal rights to gay people. The author should be commended for bringing a serious injustice to light."
5,Works Great!,I've owned this pet bowl for a month now and so far am very satisfied. We have had many nights below freezing and a few in the teens. It has not frozen at all and even melts snow as soon as it hits the bowl. No complaints at all. Also you can remove the heating element and make it a regular water bowl year round. The 5 quart size is plenty of water for my two large dogs. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs fresh water for pets especially in the winter. The price is very reasonable too.
2,"Satisfactory, but incomplete","If you wish to find out more about the first perfect games, pitched by rivals Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward in a remarkable 5 day span in 1880, you will need to look elsewhere (Ronald A. Mayer's ""Perfect!"", for example)."
4,Not the butler you were expecting,"Originally published in the mid-50s as ""The Butler Did It."" Not the VERY best of Wodehouse, but a typically contrived romp that is fun for the sheer joy of the plot twists and language. It begins in New York on the eve before the 1929 Crash, and a clot of millionaires forming a tontine for their sons. Not a ""last man living"" sort of a tontine, but a more suitably Wodehousian ""last idle male offspring to get married"" sort. The story shifts to the 1950s and the last remaining unsuspecting objects of the secret compact. The usual array of bumbling viscounts, star-eyed lads, offensive heirs, engaged showgirls, boxers and one brainbox of a butler (not Jeeves, this go round, but one Mr. Augustus Keggs) are on hand. The thoroughly obnoxious, straight-talking art dealer Mortimer Bayliss is an added bonus.This edition is a downsized hardback that is a part of the Collector's Wodehouse, reissues that are all freshly typeset and collected as one massive set."
2,What happened to Tom Kimmel??,"I loved the albums ""5 to 1"" and especially ""Circle Back Home""!! Tom Kimmel was my hero back then. Is all his other new albums like this one? I was so disappointed with this one. His raspy voice is almost gone. There is no power left! The style is totally different from earlyer releases. This one reminds me of many of the 90s week pop albums. Avoid this one, and get instead ""Circle Back Home"" (that one deserves 5 stars)!!After giving this one another chance, I actually really like the songs 1,2 and 6. They are beautiful! Today I would give this cd 3 stars."
5,TRUE SPIRIT MOVING WORSHIP,The annointing upon this young lady's life shakes one's being to the core. Get ready to worship and praise. Nicole 'brings it' in this awesome cd. She is truly a blessing to the Body of Christ!
5,TRULY AN AMAZING WORSHIP EXPERIENCE,Worship is a offering presented to God and God often examines our aroma of worship that is presented to him. Nicole songs has truly inspired me to give God the best of my worship in sincerity and truth. This C/d is truly anoited and causes you to truly love God for who he is and what he has done. To God Be The Glory!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"""You'd better get moving, big guy.""","Prince Jefri of Bahania had just been bested...by a woman! And not just any female, but Billie Van Horn, his gorgeous, take-no-prisoners flight instructor who was more than a match for this ultramasculine male.Well, she might be an ace in the air, but when it came to romance Billie was determined to keep both feet on the ground. So why did the sexy sheik make her feel as if she were soaring high above the clouds?She knew that when royal honor called, her high-born lover would fly from her side forever...unless Jefri defied his destiny and chose love..."
5,congoleum cleaner,"only cleaner we would ever use on our congoleum flooring. Other products don't do the job, and we trust congoleum for our particular floor."
3,!!! Please Note !!!!,"This rating is not particularly for this product, per se, but only to warn potential buyers that the BC-02 cartridge (as suggested by the ink/toner finder feature) will NOT fit into the Canon FAX-B160. The ink/toner finder feature is flawed and should CORRECTLY suggest the BX-20 cartridge. Happy trails."
5,Understanding,"Hey, I believe i understand the movie better then anyone except a few of the people that worked on the movie. I was behind the REAL scenes. I saw more then just the fun and games that they put on the movie for the ""behind the scenes"" Everyone worked truly hard on the film included chad calek justin holstein and dana altman. ALL of the actors committed their time to this movie. The crew did amazing work and always stuck at what they did no matter how stressed they got. You have to understand that they made this movie in 1 month. If you ask me everyone did an amazing job and i'm very proud of them all. If you ask me these people deserve a lot of respect."
1,bad business,do not order from these guys this is the worst company to do business with i ordered a laptop from them took 3 months to get it when i got it it was a defective piece of crap the drive didnt work and a week later the screen went bad returned it and never got it back not even a refund if i was amazon i would be ashamed to do business with computer and parts to this day i still havent got my laptop its been almost 6 months so beware
1,unhappy,i have used amazon many times and have never had the issues i have had when i bought this laptop. the screen is messed up dont have the right battery cord and still a week later i still have yet to recieve the right cord keep getting the run around that its on its way. and refuses to give me a refund. i dont recommend buying from them again.
1,May Have Been Good,"Well, we (my wife and I) had a good thought to get our daughter a laptop for Christmas. After we ordered it in the end of November it still never made it to our house and today is December 28.Maybe a good product, however we still don't have it.Now try to explain why ......."
3,Christmas present,"Daughter kept asking for a laptop, when I was kid I didnt have one..lol..But I figured I would buy her a cheap model to see how she would take care of it, and all that before I buy her something better.Product is exactly what I paid for, little out of date, but serves the purpose. Had some scratches on it, but other than that no complaints."
4,maes review,It made it on time . Installation was quick and fast . It was exactly what they said it was
1,Finally Got It....,"I recently received this laptop and I thought I would like it a lot. It comes with everything it says it would, but then I discovered the battery life is horrible. It only lasts about 5 minutes and then says that it needs to be recharged. Apparently it has a slot for an extra battery, but I had hoped that the battery I received would work.... I would not order from this company again. It was not a pleasant purchase-return experience at all, and the re-stocking fee is ridiculous. They do not believe in full refunds for a product they were responsible for ensuring customer satisfaction. I was not satisfied at all."
1,The Worst Deal yet,"This was the worst computer I have ever boughten! I couldn't configurate it on the day I bought it. It was SO FRAGILE. The DVD drive was broken and looked like it had been glued together. If you tilted it the drive would fall out! The screen cracked the next day when I sat it ""gently"" on the table. Im so displeased with this computer. I'm not even going to return it, for fear that someone will glue it together and sell it to another innocent consumer. Very poor quality. I might report this site to YahooNews so that the world can know that it is a SCAM. You can keep your measly $200, Amazon."
5,D600 Laptop,"Excellent condition, very fast, runs extremely well, All set up when I received it!!!! I am buying again from this store. Thank you so much!!!******"
3,not to bad....but not overly good either.,"Sluggish performance, not the good to type with (i use one for work) and for god's sake have a mouse becasue the track pad is from the pit's of hell itself as with most dell laptops."
2,CONFUSED,"I WAS ON MY DELL D600 (1.6GHZ, 40 GB HARD DRIVE, DVD/CD-RW) YESTERDAY AND A BIRD CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND FLEW AWAY WITH IT."
3,All the problems of outdoor production plus a TV video,"From Savonlinna. It's an outdoor performance and re-inforces my prejudice against them. Minimal scenery. Not even an attempt to play out the last scene. Plus the whole thing is lip sinc and although the soloists manage all right the chorus doesn't even make the attempt. Musically, the orchestra is a little raw. They play the first act and pause but then run acts 2 and 3 together. Grundheber, Behrens and Salminen and very good. On the whole I would hold out for Kupfer or some other indoor production."
3,Problematic Production,"I viewed this production last night. Some great singing Salminen, Grundheber and Behrens. Unknown tenors Sirkia and Silvvasti both sang musically and well. Fine young chours. Problems with synchonization of audio and video. Major orchestra problems especially the horns.I didn't like the intros to scenes repetitive. Quite annoyed that the first note of the overture is clipped. Sound was primitave for DVD. All in all DVD and video production values not thrilling."
3,TWO HANDS gets two thumbs up.,"I saw this movie several years ago. I already own it on VHS. Its one of my favorite Heath Ledger films. Its engrossing, exciting and humorous."
2,Academic,"The articles in this book are great reading. They provide thoughtful insite on many different topics. The cases, however, are completely useless without the instructors' manual. As best I can tell, the instructors' manual is not available for purchase unless you are using this book for a class. Therefore, in my opinion, this book is a poor value outside the academic world."
5,The beginning and current north star in beautiful environmental reasoning,This book should be required reading for every college freshman. The entire book is full of breathtaking prose. Sand County Almanac spells out the current environmental problems and solutions like no other book before or since. Since the chapters stand alone you can read it in pieces or take the book as a whole. If you love the outdoors my guess is you won't be able to set it down. Aldo's explanation of a Land Ethic is something that has and will continue to affect the way we live. Hopefully more and more.Hours spent reading Sand County Almanac are never hours wasted. It isn't seventh grade level reading so be prepared for higher level vocabulary.
4,An important milestone in Amrican nature writing,"Leopol's ""A Sand County Almanac"" is a classic piece of nature writing that presents an early understanding of ecology and the concept of an ecological community. Leopold is a seminal spokeman for the importance of preserving even microorganisms in the soil, as well as wolves and other predators and original flora considered by many to be ""weeds."" In writing style, he sometimes reaches peaks of moving lucidity, but I found the quality of his writing less consistently lovely than the works of John Muir. I give him four stars rather than five because of the lesser quality of the writing rather than its concepts."
4,Good content - difficult reading!,"Dreamweaver MX Templates is the only book on the market that cover the complexity of the new MX template system. This book is codecentric and it has some pretty advanced concepts that might be difficult for a beginner in Dreamweaver.There are some answers in this book to some questions that I have had since the upgrade from DW4 and my life working in templates has now become much easier in dealing with DW Templates. Another good point is that the authors have a ready made site with hands on examples that get you working in the concepts that they explain.I think the book could have been written better, but the content is good and for the most part accurate."
5,Seriously good book,"Dreamweaver MX has really increased its template functionality. This book will help you tap into that power. Brad and Murray do a superb job of teaching the ins and outs of using all the template features. Not only templates are covered however, so is using snippets and library items.You'll learn how to work with the various template region options, site maintenance benefits and strategies, the template code and even how to add a layer to a child page of a templated site. There are more advanced topics such as template expressions and using expressions to make ""implicit""optional regions as well as importing/exporting the template data XML.The book ends with a project that utilizes the techniques taught in the book. I don't see where the book is rated for user level but it's definitely not a beginners only book.If you are serious about site management using templates and speeding your workflow using snippets and library items, then this book is a valuable addition to your library."
2,Meh . . .,"The metal is quite thin and so is the nonstick surface. It starts coming off very early so you would definitely need to treat them first. Mine lasted about 10 months before I felt that too much of the non-stick surface was coming off. I need new pans now, and I'm not going to get these again."
3,Has some nice content,"This is not one of the reference works which are 98% useless. Does have some very good hints and is readable. Also, it's not so huge as to be daunting."
4,Take us to your whatever!,"This movie brings the Muppets back to their original format of playing themselves with several human cameos. There's really only one thing it's lacking and that's the reknowned Muppet musical numbers. Without them, it's a bit dry, but newcomers Pepe the Prawn and Bobo Bear make it well worth it. A very 'Close Encounters' ending makes it an enjoyable space movie spoof."
3,a lot of fun but WHY FULLSCREEN???,The story is cute and has some pretty good SFX too. But what idiot is still chopping widescreen movies down to fullscreen??!
5,MUPPETS!- and a nice use of DVD technology.,"I loved the movie, but I bought this for the DVD extras. I like it when DVDs do something that could only be presented on that format, and this movie's ""live video commentary"" fufills that. It brings up a little row of theater seats, MST3K style, and the director and various Muppets comment on the film. Just as funny by itself- like 2 movies in one! Plus some funny outtakes, a music video, and other stuff. A good, low-cost DVD, and a fun movie, great for little kids."
5,Best Album from La Ponceña.,"Excellent CD, Great Classic SALSA from La Sonora Ponceña. In my opinion, one of their best album if not the best from this band. Luiggy Texidor at his best. Also listen to Luiggy in Bobby Valentin's album MUSICAL SEDUCTION, well recomended."
1,Thrillier?....Where?,This book was not good at all. It didn't thrill me whatsoever. It wasn't amazingly clever or even that interesting. I'm sorry I even read it.
1,Give Patterson the time to actually write another classic!,"An unfortunate waste of time... This is certainly not the classic Patterson we eagerly await! The story line is just a short step up from Nancy Drew, and any observant mystery reader will figure out soon enough who the villians are, since so few new characters appear in the book! Although the book appears to be 392 pages, there are WIDE margins, double spacing, and each 1-2 page chapter starts another new page! Save your money and go to the library. This one-afternoon read is NOT worth the price!"
3,Mystery and Mayhem,I was disappointed in this book. James Patterson wasn't at his usual best. I read every book he writes and this one just wasn't what I expected from him. I will still purchase future books. The characters were weak and it just didn't go anywhere.
3,Wasted Space,This may end up being a good book but I just can't get past the annoyance of the extremely short chapters to get into the book. None of the chapters seem to more than two pages long. I don't mind an occasional short chapter...but not this short...and not every chapter. With so many wasted blank pages it ends up being an extremely short book.
2,Awful book,"The only redeeming value of this book is it did make me care about the protagonist, Lindsay Boxer, through most of it. Otherwise, it is simply awful. The crucial crime with which the novel opens and ""trial"" is hopelessly unrealistic -- downright goofy. And the ""solution"" to the string of crimes that occupies most of the book, revealed at the end, is a joke, with no reasonable predicates. Don't waste $2 on this book."
3,4th of July.,"Ok, I just got through the 4th of July, the, well, 4th book in the Women's Murder Club. Generally, I enjoy this series, but this one was a little lackluster, reading a little too quick, and not having enough suspense. Someday's I wonder if I'm getting too cynical in my old age. <grin>Ah well, there's always next time."
1,not worth buying,I read the first three books and this book fell flat. It was so boring I skipped many parts just to finally get to the end. I read the advanced copy and told many of my customers not to buy this book. I recommended The Innocent by Harlan Coben
3,One is enough.,"This novel had a fairly good plot, and was narrated well by Carolyn McCormick. However, the excessive use of adjectives and some of the scene embellishments reminded my wife and me of sophomoric level English composition. Instead of being drawn into the plot, we were laughing at the script. We'll avoid Ms. Paetro in the future."
4,Another great book in the series,Lt Boxer and her friends never let me down. Always keep me guessing right to the end. I expect that book number five will be just as thrilling.
2,Over the Top,"As a long time James Patterson fan, and a fan of the Womens Murder Club series I was very disappointed. First of all the so called police brutality was quite unbelievable and Mickey Sherman as Lindsey Boxler's attorney was way over the top.Not much in this story rang true. Everything was just to ""cute"" and pat to suit me. I missed the interaction of the rest of the ""club"" who seemed to just the background noise. The scenes with boyfriend Joe were unrealistic and boring. Cooking gourment food together, I doubt it. Who is Maxine Paetro, and what part of the book did she write? I she getting paid for this as it seems James Patterson is getting all the credit.All in all a real disappointing book. Save you money for something good."
4,not as good,"While this book was pretty good and an enjoyable summer read, it was not as good as the previous 3. The overall plot was OK, but Patterson didn't seem to utilize the ""Women's Murder Club"" as much as before - the remaining members seemed an afterthought. The addition of a new 4th member was totally unexpected, and it seemed not really thought out very well. She just seemed to show up with no significant character or background developement. Of course, that leaves something to be developed for the next book...Seeing as I read this a month ago, I can't even remember the romantic interest that was introduced so I have to assume (at least to me) that it wasn't that important to the story line! If you liked the previous 3, get this one. If you haven't read them, start from the beginning!"
1,Reads like a Harlequin romance novel,"James Patterson should be embarrassed to put his name to a book this bad. Lucky for Maxine Paetro (the 'collaborator') that Mr. Patterson's pride isn't getting in the way of his making a buck. If he keeps this up, the value of his name on a book soon won't be worth much."
1,Money Back?,"This book should have a money back guarantee, like those offered by some publishers. I would get my money back.After being expected to buy into Patterson's version of civil law procedure, totally off the wall judge's and a public reaction to news events that probably would not take place anywhere except with Islamic extremists, I gave up before I had finished a quarter of this book.I had just finished ""Honeymoon"" and can't believe the difference."
4,"If you enjoy mysteries,this is a good series","I started the ""Women's Murder Club"" on a whim and it is a very good read. Keeps me interested and the characters are a good blend. Hope the series stays this way."
2,Causes breakage,If your hair has any dye or bleach in it (doesn't matter if it's been there for a while) then it WILL break. It will look like you literally fried your hair. Otherwise it seems like it might be ok to use.It's a problem for me just because I have bleach in my hair and like to dye it a lot. Oh well....
1,It's horror alright.... AS IN HORRIBLE!!!!,The guy can't sing and his guitar playing is awful! WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO KID? This one deserves negative stars!
4,An actual review,"... I decided to try the Extended Pleasures. Wow I think they worked a little too good, as I had trouble reaching climax. They have benzocane in them which makes you fairly numb, and I think that they're a little thicker than normal condoms. IMO they should have a touch less benzocane and be a little thinner.After you put it on you should wait a minute as it takes the benzocane about a minute to take full effect. Then go to town..."
1,THE RIGHT TEMPTATION,"This film will keep your attention however, if you watch the trailer first, you'll know everything. Including the twists that occur throughout the film. While the film had promise, it suffered from a deplorable lack of substance and plausible storyline. If you avoid this feature, even at the rental counter, you will have yielded to...The Right Temptation. 1 star."
3,Best Viewed in Small Doses,"Since we never could catch when it was on Comedy Central, I decided to go ahead and get this 1st season DVD collection.It's kinda funny here and there, but watching more than 2 in a week seems to have left me burned out on it."
3,The latter day cousin to SLEDGE HAMMER!,"RENO 911 is a funny show and if you enjoyed that then make sure to check out SLEDGE HAMMER: SEASON ONE when it's unleashed next month on DVD. RENO 911 is very amusing, but SLEDGE is pure genius as well as an all time satirical classic, on par with GET SMART, that was truly ahead of its time."
1,What the hell?,"No offense, but this is such a gyp. The cursing is still bleeped, and so is the nudity, No offense, but when I plopped down 23 of my hard earned dollars for this, I expected that I would at least get a few specailities (ie, cursing and nudity). This is a moral outrage, and CC should be ashamed."
2,"Kind of funny, but lame overall","If you like to see stupid people doing even stupider things, you will love Reno 911. I do applaud the cast on trying to keep things fresh (which always isn't easy w/ an improvised show). Overall though, I'd have to say it gets boring after repeat viewing.On a side note, the show is not filmed in Reno (the Palm trees are a dead giveaway), nor does in particularly reflect Reno in any realistic sense. Not that it needs to as the show itself is a farce."
4,"Great price, Excellent story","This paperback edition (Wilder Publications) is a good price and the book is bound well. There are a number of typographical errors that would have been relatively easy to catch, which make it clear that this was a quick copy from a public domain site, and not a labor of love for the story. It's a BEAUTIFUL story and if I could be paying the author or someone like her instead, I would have preferred that. As far as reading it, LOVE IT! Every book by this author is magical in the way it brings every detail to life and makes you FEEL like you are there. Whether you want to interest a child in plants and butterflies, build character, inspire great writing, or simply enjoy a trip back in time, you'll not be disappointed for a moment."
1,SHUT UP AND SING!,"I would give this a ZERO except you cant rate it that low.I used to be able to seperate JB from his views, no nukes etc.No more, after seeing this tour and listening to the typical liberal whining, I cant take it any more.He is now officially off the deep and is a wack-job liberal.Hey JB and ALL libs: Get over the 2000 and 2004 elections, you LOST...........We are SICK of hearing about how upset you are with the elections. Get a clue about the issues, get a QUALIFIED candidate and try again. You will lose but at least you wont make such Jack-azzes of yourselves. It is now wonder your party has a donkey for it symbol!Take your own advice and MOVE ON!"
5,Awesome album,"This CD is really awesome. He tends to play the songs that the crowd calls out. He jokes around with the crowd a lot which I think is a nice addition to the music. He plays on both acoustic guitar and also on piano. The piano songs are..The Birds of St. Marks, Fountain of Sorrow, For a Dancer, and The Pretender. I believe those are the only ones. The rest are acoustic. My favorite songs would have to be...The Birds of St. Marks, Fountain of Sorrow, These Days, Too Many Angels, The Pretender, and Take it Easy. Although in my opinion every song is really good. Also, the sound quality is amazing if you care about that. I would defiantly recommend this for any fan of Jackson Browne. Also 'Late for the Sky' or 'For Everyman'."
5,Just Right,What a great selection of finely crafted tunes. The friendly live solo recordings are wonderful...(what great guitar tone)allowing Jackson to deliver a great performance. I really would enjoy a DVD of these performances....
3,Difficult to know if I want to buy...,"Amazon did a very poor job in choosing selections from tracks for our listening pleasure. This is provided, I assume, to help us determine that indeed we love the snippets we have heard and will buy the album. Several of these clips were intros to songs only. It's nice to know that they are live recordings, but it would be nice to hear some of the music... I gave 3 stars because I had to provide something, but the real rating is [???-no idea]"
3,I NEED Volume !! Out NOW!,"Volume 1 is GREAT! But I'm an ""I want it NOW"" kind of guy, I really need to have Vol 2..3..4... released ASAP. There are so many other old songs that I would LOVE to here Jackson sing, ""unwired"". (and play). Perhaps, ""The Only Child, or my FAVORITE, ""Sleep's Dark & Silent Gate"" on the next volume (if there is one) LIVE, would blow me away. I have been lstening to Jackson since I was 14 years old, (much older now) In good times, but truly more in bad times. He helped me focus on what was ""real"" in my life. The Live CD is so much more personable to hear a normal Jackson Browne LP. JB. DO IT! WHEN IS VOLUME 2 COMING??? Please! (and thank-you).Just remember Jackson, OLDER songs, please) : )"
5,A very intimate concert:,"If you like Jackson Browne, well this is a no brainer. If you like great song writing, great acoustic music, a great live concert, great songs in general, well this is a no brainer.The songs are all top notch, the clarity of the audio is awesome, it really feels like he's singing in the same room with you. It's so clear!He gives very nice intros and stories through-out the whole album.This is definitely the cd to listen to if you just want to zone out and get lost in some great music.A+++ all the way.Can't wait to listen to Vol.2.Happy listening!"
3,"Condition of the paper back book ""A Town Like Alice""","I was told that my book would be in ""GOOD"" condition. Although the book was not ""Dog Eared"" the pages are falling out as I read the book. I think that this problem is happening because the copy I received is quite old. I think that the seller should have taken a better look at the book before he/she rated its condition. The story reads a little slow for my taste, but I visited Australia in 2003 and I fell in love with that country. My intrest in the country keeps me reading while I try to keep the pages from falling out of the book."
5,One of my favorite stories of all time.,"This classic of literature takes place on three continents. It involves history, geography, travel, adventure, misery, joy, evil, and love. He creates marvelous three-dimensional characters. Even the countryside is like another character, because it's so full and important to the story. I first discovered this story on PBS's ""Masterpiece Theater"" and that production was true to the book. The video (of that production) and the audiotape are also excellent. I had tears in my eyes when it came to an end, wanting it to go on and on. A completely satisfying book."
4,Good read!,"I loved this book. A real easy read and one you'll find hard to put down. My only one complaint is that the leading female character was a little ""gushy"" with too many ""Oh Joe's"" which irked me somewhat. The overall story is fantastic though."
5,A fantastic surprise..,"A friend of mine (who's literary taste I have long trusted) sent me this book in the mail with a note saying I must put down whatever I was reading at the moment and read A Town Like Alice. What a wonderful gift she gave me. I never would have found this book in my normal travels, but it was a delicious read. I cared very much for the lead characters and stayed up late the first night to find out what happened to them. I plan to pass this book on to more friends. It's too good to keep to myself."
2,There are better Nixon biographies,"I consider this biography to be a disappointment. It is not a ""true"" catalogue of Nixon's life nor is it an interpretation of his presidency. Nor is it a portrait of ""Nixon's America"" as the title implies. Whatever this book is, it will not enlighten the reader about who Richard Nixon was or his term in office. There has to be a better book on this subject. I hope."
4,People Need To Know The Truth,"Look at all the problems we have with with teens in our generation; trust me, Jordan is a part of this. All this Be Like Mike...youngsters copy Jordan's ego, his temper, etc...all in all, I'm glad people speak out against Jordan."
4,Indomitable will > petty infighting,"A fascinating inside look at the Bulls' first championship season. Perhaps naively, I expected to see a portrait of a well-oiled machine. Instead one finds infighting, insecurity, and petulance--yet somehow none of this kept them from winning it all. However much one ends up disliking Jordan, his ego, and his sense of entitlement, one can't help but admire his incomparable talent and indomitable will."
1,Tme for a Change or Time for a Con,"Let me put it simply. This book is garbage. Presumably one of Bandler's recorded seminars, if you believe this is anything but another way of filling Bandler's pocket with money, then think again.Let me quote one paragraph:""I once took a young woman of 18, a great hypnotic subject, put her in a trance, and sped up her vision to the point where the world moved in slow motion. I then took her out on a mat and put her against a 5th degree black belt Aikido. Without any martial arts training she beat him. She had all the time in the world. He would make the moves but her movements were much faster.""Oh Yeah, tell me another....if you believe this, then you must believe cows can fly (and probably see alien spaceships).Conning people with such stories is just the lowest of the low.Makes you wonder about NLP if this one of its leading lights???!!I would give it minus 5 stars if I couldMichael Church"
5,An inspiring collection of American voices,"This is an optimistic and inspiring collection of American voices.It reminds us of how much we owe to average Americans who had the courage to speak their minds, expressing contrary opinions often at the risk of their life or liberty.Just as Dr. King warned us against taking ""the tranquilizing drug of gradualism"", this collection reminds us that real change comes from direct action.""The People Speak"" is a fitting memorial to the late Howard Zinn. Share this with young people to help them understand not just that people can make a difference, but that only the people can make a difference."
2,Almonds,Big disappointment...candy was very very hard to eat and I do not recommend this product at all. Cant eat it.
2,"not great quality, but cute product","My husband was initially so thrilled to have this baby bodysuit, but after a couple of washes it really looked dingy -- it had started to pill and the brightness was not there.I also found it hard to see the print when we took photos of our son in this. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Another comic interpretation movie,"During a time when comic interpret movie was common in the 1996/97 era, this was one of the by-product. I think this is a pretty bad movie in general and it just really wasn't executed well. The plot is based on the comic Red Light District comic with Playman Man (played by Michael Tao) vs. But Bit Wah (played by Simon Yam). There were two hot female lead, Chimney Yao and Shi Chi but the story was poor and the entire story is rather incomplete. This one is defn not worth the money for but if you enjoy comic intrepretation movie, you might enjoy this one."
3,not as intersting as i thought,"This is my first experience with matcha powder tea made at home. It is difficult to get to froth and much more of the powder is needed than I originally thought. I like the taste (bitter) but don't see much benefit to powder vs loose tea. Although, clean up is very easy."
5,Delicious,"This powdered green tea is very good and a consistent quality. I make it hot. But if I don't have time to drink it, it is still great cold. You can find it cheaper elsewhere though."
2,Didn't Work Out,"This device needs direct sunlight for it to work and it does not move a whole lot of air. I can't see putting a hole in the roof for this device, although it might work well on a storage shed."
1,mystery junk,"i liked ben stiller BEFORE this thing came out, but now i cant stand him after watching this movie. its really bad and doesnt have one laugh in it at all. i saw this in the theaters thinking 'this is gonna be funny, ben stillers in it' but nope. i took a nap halfway through it and was thoroughly disappointed. i liked theres something about mary, i liked meet the parents, but it seems like he comes out with one good movie (something about mary) and follows it up with an utterly horrible and retarded movie (zoolander). ben stiller needs to go back to his failed fox sitcom"
2,"Good movie, poor HD format","I think this is one of the most underrated comedies. It's very funny, but the HD fizzles big time. This version is exactly like the DVD. No vivid colors, no pop, just blah. Get the DVD version. Do not buy this HD DVD!"
1,Unsatisfied,"I am a huge of Ben Stiller and Janeane Garafolo but this movie turned out to be lame with a couple funny scenes. If you haven't seen it, rent it. Not worth buying. It gets one star for seeing Ben Stiller. He hams up his character as a tough guy while covering up his personal problems."
2,Why they made this movie is a mystery to me.............,"This all-star cast couldn't save this lame duck movie about a group of wanna-be superheros. In Champion City, Captain Amazing is losing sponsers as all the bad guys are locked away. He needs the sponsers back, so he appeals to the parole board to let out his foe Casanova Frankstein. However Captain Amazing is set-up and held in Frankenstein castle as a prisoner. So here comes the Mystery Men - Mr.Furious who couldn't beat his way out of a wet paper bag. Spleen who has Superman power flatulence. The Shovler is level-headed family man out prove his wife wrong about his crime fighting ability. The Bowler chick who has dear dad's skull inside a custom made bowling ball....Like Mighty Mouse they're out too save the day and rescue Captain Amazing.I found the movie too corny and stupid. I liked the Disco Kids and Mr.Furious,that was about it. A terrible waste of actors who should of know better."
1,el stinko,"This was a real turkey. The previews looked funny, but those were the only funny parts in the movie. The fart jokes were funny, but not enough to make seeing this movie worth 2 hours of my life. It stank, no pun intended."
4,One of The Better Ones,"Of all the ordinary folks turned super heroes movies out now, this is one of the better ones. The characters are ordinary or less so,, yet over-the-top enough to make a very good comedy. This a very good movie. If you only watch it once, you'll remember it."
3,funny,"this one is off the wall with its wannabe superheroes and its villians galore. the one who shines in this movie is Ben Stiller(Mr. Furious)he was so hilarious. theres a funny superhero at that barbeque called The Waffler(hilariously played by Dane Cook, a stand up comedian on Comedy Central)Favorite LinesMr. Furious(Ben Stiller)- what kind of a crazy person blows up a crazy houseMr. Fruious(Ben Stiller)- that little sucker just saved your life(he says this after squeezing a ball)Blue Radja(Hank Azaria)- may the forks be with us( of course pitted after Star Wars)Casanova Frankestien(Geoffrey Rush)- can you dig it?!!!(of course pitted after The Warriors)"
2,Never Takes Off,"MYSTERY MEN has all the elements for a really funny send-up of comic book heroes...it's just never really funny.There was an article in a screenwriting magazine a couple of years ago about the original script to this film. I skimmed the article but the gist of the piece was that something happened to MYSTERY MEN from script to screen that diluted the humor. (I know, I know, it happens to a LOT of movies). It would be interesting to find the original script online and check out the differences.MYSTERY MEN has a cool idea and a great cast. But it just doesn't build any momentum or have any big laughs.The only moment that worked for me was the ultimate fate of Greg Kinnear's character. Now THAT was funny.I just wish the rest of the film had been crazy and off-the-wall."
2,Not That Great,I went to the theater expecting this to be a funny movie. But it was pretty dumb with only a few funny parts.
4,very funny.,"THE STROY:some loser ""super""heros try to rid the world of evil. Mr. Furoius who gets really mad. The Sholver who hits people with shovel. the spleen ........ the bowler who hits people with bowling balls. the invisible boy who can only become invisible when no ones watching. the blue raja who throws silverwere but not knifes because that could hurt som one. and the sphinkx who is terribly mysteryouis.THE HOW IT WAS:very good laugh out loudn funny pg-13 for voilence but mostly stays clean. I would have rated it pg if not g. well not g there was some bathroom humour. but pg. Id let little kids watch it its pretty good.THE DVD: I HAVE VHS but i still want the dvd.OOVERALL:excellent and only 1 dirty joke."
2,Something is missing...,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just missed some little bit of chemistry somewhere. It struck me that they wanted to make a campy movie, but also wanted a serious movie, and in that they fail. The script and director look like they are trying to strive for a live action film a la ""The Tick"" cartoon series, but they wanted a plot under it all that is more like ""Batman"". The nuttiness of the characters and setting don't mix with the attempts at a serious subtext. Overall, as a theatrical movie, this is a miss. Its an entertaining diversion for a rainy afternoon though."
2,DO I NEED ANOTHER VIEWING?,"I expected a lot more from this movie, and as with many other movies, I might do well to watch it a second time to fully appreciate it. It might change my opinion dramatically. For now, though, I can say that the excellent cast and the hype I had heard excited me to the point that this film turned out to be quite disappointing for me. Generally I love all the actors featured here, so I hoped for something a bit more... compelling.How about I watch it again and make another assessment?"
3,Freezes,"Product price excellent, shipping time good, item professionally wrapped excellent, most of movie (recording excellent)- BUT there are 2 spots that just freeze. Therefore, you have to fast forward a bit on those two spots. You get what you pay for though. The movie was cheap (price wise)."
1,"In the like of godzilla, wild wild west comes...","There are no mysteries, this film is a flop. Here are a few points to acknowledge:* It doesn't even deserve one star.* I'm glad there were no great hype about this flop of film.* How could anybody give the producers the budget to create this movie?* If you were to buy this dvd, make sure you also include godzilla, wild wild west, the avengers to your collection."
4,Cpt. Furious is my Hero,"This is a silly movie that looks at crime fighting from a different point of view. Hank Azaria is wonderful and Stiller and Macy are great as well. Filled with odd little quirks and tons of laughs, this movie will entertain most. If you are a fan of Ben Stiller then be sure to see this movie."
2,"Clever concept, but didn't finish it","The concept behind the ""marriage bargain"" was definitely cute and innovative. However, I found the heroine's actions in the last 20% of the book totally nonsensical. I really couldn't bring myself to finish it as a result. The traditional romance novel ""misunderstanding and resolution"" here just seemed forced."
1,Cute - Fun - Charming!,"I loved it and I have read hundreds of romances. The tests of Hercules are adapted to historical England. This was wonderful -- and with the side characters, I liked the romances going between their best friends, too."
3,Cute but tedious,"Started with a bang, but it got so tedious towards the end, I just wanted to jump in the book and slap the heroine. Love him already will ya Pandora!!! Took me a week to get to the end, just could not get into the book like her others."
4,"The first of Quick's, Iowa Trilogy, on the settling of Iowa","ALL quick books are out of print except VandeMark's Folley (reprinted 1987) Best described as historical fiction. (I live near VandeMark's Marsh) Quick blends the hardships and joys of Early Iowa, with vivid pictures of the Iowa prairie. It's adventure, romance, geography, and history all rolled into one. Quicks style of writing is very similar to Mark Twains. Defineetly worth reading."
3,"Expensive, Killdirt terrible service","I am hugely unhappy with my Miele Neptune vacuum and expensive bags don't contribute to a good impression. Also, I bought the case through Amazon market - Killdirt - and took four emails to get the five boxes. They shipped one, then two boxes, then finally the last two of the case. One mistake perhaps understandable, but three tries to get five boxes, hmmmmm."
3,Hmm...,"I have no idea how this CD has 3 5 star reviews, I think it's just another band playing catch up with bands like Unearth, Killswitch, and all the other metalcore bands. Nothing special.It reminds me of Susperia, or Grip Inc, or Exodus. In parts...you love the sound...but for whatever reason, you just can't focus all the way through a song. It's that ""whatever reason"" that makes me give this 3 stars. It's an okay CD to burn. Buy it though, and you'll probably get tired of it.They definitely have a great sound, I just wish their songwriting was a little bit better."
5,Champion Lightweight,"This little machine works wonders on hardwood floors, ceramic tile floors and area rugs. It's also light enough to vacuum furniture. Easy to clean dust cup. Love it!!"
1,Text book,The book was returned because the post office would not deliver it. I had to buy it from another website.
4,great to get started with Pilates,I have several pilates tapes and although this is the easiest it is my favorite. Hilary gives you time to do the exercise and the imagery is great. Try it you'll love it! I wish she had another video out.
2,I was disappointed in this video,"I have taken mat classes based on pilates since August. I love the workout. I wanted to do it at home also and relied on reviews to choose a video. The people who raved about this one must be friends with Hilary Burnett. She rushes through every exercise and does not give instructions on how or what to do. The viewer is supposed to just follow, I guess. I was able to follow the exercises just because I know what I am doing but would not have had a clue otherwise except to try to follow her fast moves and changes with no instruction. I have heard good things about Jennifer Kries and Moira Stott-I think I will ditch this video and try theirs."
1,No way to chose which platform to download,"This was for Palm OS and the OS is compatible with both WIN and Mac. I am sure it is a good program, but there is no way to chose which parent platform to download for. I did not find out there were two different downloads until after I paid the money and try to install it and asking customer support. SO BE CAREFUL IF YOU OWN A MAC, THEY WILL ASSUME YOU OWN A WINDOWS MACHINE AND HAVE YOU DOWNLOAD ITS SOFTWARE!!"
3,"Review of ""Cook's Book""","This book is nothing less than an encyclopedia of food. It tries to cover all the bases, from A to Z literally, in its 559 pages.When it is relevant, each entry comprises background, varieties, description, seasons, buying tips, storage, cooking, etc. for each product.Although bits of the information contained in this tome are now dated (it was published in 1981), much of it is still current and useful. For instance, the one in regards to the adverse health effects of monosodium glutamate (MSG) intake.Also specially helpful are the appendices, which include a glossary and a 62-page official nutrition chart taken from United States government sources.This book would be a nice complement to any up-to-date publication."
3,Very Poorly Made Coffee Maker,"I bought this Santos from Amazon and in only 5 months it broke. Bodum offers a two year warranty so I returned it to Bodum (and they know this coffee maker has problems)and they gave me a brand new one. Only 6 months later the replacement broke, too.I was not going to get a third replacement. Who wants a coffee maker you need to keep returning twice a year. I purchased a Black and Decker Infuze and it works great and made of better materials, like a steel base.Bodum is a great company -- they normally make good quality products. But maybe electric appliances are just not their thing. But this coffee maker is not cheap and it should last for more than 6 months."
5,"better, faster, cheaper, and easy on the eyes","this coffemaker is absolutely the best affordable coffee brewing technology on the market. 20 ounces of water in; 20 ounces of coffee out. for my money, i use a lot less coffee per cup than with drip. i've heard complaints that the mini santos is difficult to use at first, but it took 3 minutes to read the instructions and 6 minutes later i was enjoying my first cup. cleaning is easier than a french press, and because everything is plastic, no cracked or broken beekers. what i admire most about the santos is the simplicity and economy of design, which matches the technology perfectly. no frilly ornamentation or chrome switches. the integrity and integration of technololgy, design, materials, and price tag are what home appliances should all be about. bodum delivers on this promise."
5,Louis L'Amour,"Bought this book for my son, an avid reader. Wanted to introduce him to a great author. Great book, great seller, great shipping for the holiday."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"OK I'm the first to admit this dvd is ... but unfortunately so are the actors and the production is not action but very bad impersantions of russians, the pic quality and sound are good but there is no plot to this film, you can normally show any cheap action movie to me and I will find some type of plot or enjoyment, however this is a very low budget ... movie, after watching for 45mins it was totally unbearable, if any one wants my copy please contact me with your details, its yours free because its truly ..."
1,Don't bother!,"Rutger Hauer must have been really hard-up or hankering for a little recognition to even bother making this awful movie! Frankly, I have never really thought much of Hauer. He appeared in ""Blade Runner""... So what!This movie is so bad it's unwatchable!"
4,Best coffee chopper I've owned,"Great coffee chopper (no burrs so I won't call it a grinder.) The main difference between this and the other I've owned is that the chopped coffee doesn't get hot. In most others the coffee at the bottom of the chamber gets cooked by the friction of the blades. Cooked coffee means less flavor in the cup.I won't give up my burr grinder for this, but its very good for the office or when I am too lazy to clean out my burr grinder."
1,Don't buy this! Won't turn off!,I bought this grinder and after about 2 weeks of use it stopped turning off until it was unplugged. I returned it and got a replacement. After about a month the same problem happened with the new grinder. clearly a design flaw.
2,grinds evenly but... blade came off after minimal use,"I bought this grinder on the recommendation of a coffee web site who claimed it ground more evenly than the Braun. First the pluses. It does grind more evenly. The cord also wraps nicely beneath the base in a nice bit of engineering.Now for the negatives compared to the Braun: 1) much louder, 2) awkward shape to hold (""art for art's sake""), 3) takes longer to grind, 4) lid too shallow to hold ground coffee ; creates much more mess.But the main reason for this review is about the build quality. I was stunned to see that the blade came loose from the shaft after barely any use! We grind maybe four cups a day of beans and within a couple months the blade started to be loose. I'm not sure what went wrong, maybe the piece situated right under the blade, which seems to have be gone and disintegrated. Was this just a rotten apple in a good bunch? All I can say is my old Braun is still going strong after ten years of use."
3,"A Dream, Not The Dream","With this book Mr. Berry created an important milestone in a late 20th-century environmental movement, which had begun to sour from an excess of quantative analysis. The Dream of the Earth helped restore some qualitative analysis to the discussion of where-to-next, which appropriately enough was published by an exemplary Sierra Club press.At its best (and there are some gratifying moments) the narrative is an pointed critique of ""western"" civilization's patriarchy. In that respect Berry strays from old-world Catholicism. At its worst (book title included) it is patriarchic itself. Whats with all the ""the""s? Berry seems to be stuck in the western mentality, even though his training includes eastern philosophy, which would be more suggestive of possibility. Berry is describing A Dream, not The Dream. Further let us hope he comprehended that a universe this immense allows for myriad Earths.Read the book. It presents a useful construct; biocentrism (aka ecofeminism)."
4,Easy Read,"Danny's Bed is a nice little piece reflecting upon the haunts of historic Savannah, Ga. It is a quick read but it really pinpoints the issues that Danny's family was facing dealing with spirits of the other world. Having lived in Savannah myself, the book leaves me yearning to go back and walk through the gates at Bonaventure Cemetery again. There are a few typos, but it doesn't hurt the story. Nice Read, 4 Stars."
4,Great Toy - Not Just for 2 years and up,"My son is only 9 1/2 months old and he loves these puzzles. The age range says 2 years and up, but he can already do the puzzle with the basic shapes. The knobs are plenty large enough for him to hold and carry, and he enjoys pulling out all the puzzles and scattering the pieces. I only gave it four stars because the pictures on the puzzle pieces can be damaged if chewed on."
5,A sturdy educational gift,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was ten months old. Within a few days of receiving it she could put all the pieces back where they belonged without help. She also learned to identify receptively square, triangle, and circle from this puzzle by the time she was one. The wooden case is also very sturdy, I have actually caught her standing on it and it didn't break, thank God! The case makes it nice to store the puzzles neatly. Don't expect the child to be able to put the completed puzzles back into the case themselves though. She played with this toy often until about 18 mo old when she moved onto harder puzzles. A good toy that lasts a while."
4,Sega Rally Revo,"Sega Rally Revo is a great fun game for the bucks spent. Granted its not GT5, but for me it's a must have for hours of non stop fun, and enjoyment.Try it you'll like it."
1,wrong product for bissell quick steamer,Do not buy this with the bissell quick carpetBissell 2080 Quicksteamer Powerbrush II Lightweight Upright Deep Cleaner Carpet Cleanersteamer. I rang up Bissell to check suitable products for this machine and they said used all big steamer machine products only. I threw away all the bottles I purchased after I received this information.
3,bottle size?,"Be sure you check the size of the bottle--when my order arrived, the bottles were much smaller than I had anticipated. Just be aware of the fluid ounces on the bottle so you know what you're getting. Haven't used the soap/solution yet and cannot rate it's effectiveness."
4,I have a lifetime supply worth!!,I bought this with the 4 for 3 deal and now I don't think I will ever run out.
3,Ordered the wrong volume,"I was disappointed to receive this study guide because I thought I was ordering volume 2, which is a bit longer at 170 pages and covers more material including math word problems, literary response, writing applications, and other subject matter. I could not find volume 2 on Amazon and had mistakenly assumed this guide (volume 1) was the same one I had seen in a retail store (which was really volume 2). Volume 1 has simpler questions while volume 2 contains more difficult questions, and covers a broader range of content. Since they are both regularly priced at $19.95, I think volume 2 is the better deal."
2,Cheap Junk,Not that I expected much because I did not pay much but lets just say the images looked better than the actual item. everything about the item was cheap materials etc.
2,TOOOOO SMALLLLL,This is a cute costum but do not purchase if you are bigger than a small size for males. I was very disappointed that my brother couldn't wear this for my Christmas party so I'm sending it back. Need to make it fits at least a size large if it is suppose to be one size fits most.
3,Not bad,"Most of the costume is good, but the hat is very short. It fits an adult head, but the length is not as pictured. The little ball doesn't hardly fall over the side. And the belt was only 26 inches in total length. That is one very skinny Santa! A normal adult size belt needs to fit between 30-36 inches, and a Santa with stuffing should be much larger. Beyond that, not to bad for such a cheap price."
1,This product is misrepresented,"The product works well as a stand alone application, but does not work with MS Money. It is completely useless for those looking to something that will transfer back and forth."
2,the Black book,this is an interesting film by quality film makers -- but the quality of the print on the DVD STINKS! Not sure where one can find a good clean print of this public domain film... However the vendor that shipped the DVD was excellent.
4,"Not an ideal intro, but a keeper","The University of Pittsburgh used this text my p-chem I class, which deals with quantum physics. This book and the associated answer manual have a wealth of information, and I think this will be a great addition to my library for the years to come. I noticed, however, that the highly detail mathematical derivations of key equations often came at the expense of explanations or illustrations. I like mathematical rigor, but it helps to explain the significance of the mathematical models, and this book could do a much better job. Rather than fishing for the right information in McQuarrie, I found myself going to the Atkins text to help ease me into McQuarrie. This book has great staying power due to its great detail and scope of topics, and I'm treasuring my copy, but it has flaws as a beginning undergraduate text."
5,Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach,I received the correct book in excellent condition (matching the seller's description) in the timeframe I was told when I purchased it.
5,An Inspirational Experience,"This documentary was by far the most moving, piercing, inspirational piece of film or any media I have ever seen. Not only is the subject, James Nachtwey, deeply inspirational in his devoted, quiet, compassionate commitment to documenting the lives of the countless millions suffering today, but the film itself is extraordinary. Seeing the full context of the photographer's subject before the photo is taken (through a videocamera attached to the camera) makes the effect of Nachtwey's work, his life, and the lives of those he photographs that much more powerful. This is the one documentary I would recommend all of my friends watch. Truly inspirational."
5,Excellent view of war photography,"If you want to know what it's like to be a combat photographer, just buy it. Enough said. You will be keeping this one as a permanent addition to your library."
1,Bad DVD,I bought these two dvds and have been unable to play them on either my standard dvd player or my Blu-Ray player. First time I have been dissatisfied with something I bought from Amazon. Be careful. The only reason I rated it at 1 star is because this entry program won't let me get by without a rating.
2,This movie sucks ***,"One of characters said to a doctor he just met, ""It's not the only big thing I have."" Our brave Marine then followed with, ""It's practically your civic duty to have sex with me."" With stupid lines like these, the movie seemed as if it was made for the junior-high crowd. And if the reviews here mean anything, it worked."
2,Pointless flick,"The only reason I watched this movie was because it was an HD DVD-great picture and sound. The plot is similar to Aliens, but without any suspense, thrills, or humor. I love the Rock and he is fine, but the movie was just plain boring. I was more creeped out by the Doom 3 video game. The only reason to watch this movie is if you are starved for HD DVD content."
1,Terrible & Horrible.,"Either way, you lose. Terrible screenplay, horrible acting, bore-to-death plot, elemetary-school level junk. Nothing worth reviewing here. If you think it's fun, you'd get more fun by going to elementary school's playground with your mom. grow up! The Rock acted so poorly that almost became an eye-sore. The female character (the sister) was a terrible cast, suggest her to keep the waitress job in Hollywood and don't quit too soon."
1,"Could have been much better, much better","This movie was a real disappointment. I was not expecting much from it aside from some cool monster smashing and bashing but even that did not turn out to be very satisfying.Most of the film takes place in dark or very dimly lit environments. What that means is that aside from some shadows, flashes of light and screams not much more can be made out. Every now and then you can catch a glimpse of a monster for a split second. Not until the end when the camera perspective goes to FPS style can you see some rather generic zombie like creatures along with a few more demon-like silhouettes.There's only two semi-satisfying monster encounters; first, where the hero fights a dog like creature and of course *Spoiler* the end fight with the infected Sarge (The Rock). Everything else is simply unimpressive and uninteresting."
3,"Could Have Been Great, Just OK","I am a fan of almost Sci-Fi movies and video games, so am predispositioned to rate even ""bad"" movies as at least watchable. Sadly, this is the group Doom falls into. The premise is fairly straight forward and those who played game will likely enjoy seeing the monsters ""fleshed out"" (pun intended :-) but it loses a lot in translation from game to movie.""The Rock"" turned in a strong performance and perhaps saved the film almost singlehandedly. The special effects were great in some parts and fairly weak in others, which leads me to believe that there was more than one production company working on the CGI elements.Overall, it is watchable and even enjoyable if you are fan of the genre."
3,Migraine Time,"This film is enjoyable if you watch it in a dark room so that the images pop from the screen. If you leave the lights on, you will find that you can barely see what's going on. So much of the action is shot in the dark that you will find yourself squinting and getting seasick. The action is OK, but the first hour of the extended version is pretty boring. Much of the dialogue and story are copied from Alien, Aliens and Predator. The Rock is entertaining and the musical score also rocks. Brace yourself for the seizure-inducing action sequences that copy the video game (you are the camera, running down corridors, shooting cannibal zombies); it's migraine time."
2,Magnets don't stick to back.,"To attach this to your fridge, you have to attach the magnets to the back of the board. Unfortunately, the magnets stick very poorly, and after 10 or 20 minutes, the board falls down, leaving the magnets behind. I tried pressing them down overnight, but that didn't help. Now have to go find some epoxy to stick them on.Update: after gluing them to the back, it has worked well. The eraser on the pen is a bit flimsy and I don't expect it to last, but there's always paper towels."
1,Does not work for me at all,I tried every possible way to make this splitter work and I have been unsuccessful. It works with my ps3 sometimes and with my high def cable box I get sound and no picture. I thought it was the cable at first so i spent $100 bucks on sony 1.3 compliant high speed hdmi cables and still the same result. I am in the process of trying to get a refund!
1,Tried every way to connect to A/V Unit,"I bought this with the hope that it would make it convenient to switch from my HD_DVD, Blu-ray, and upconvert dvd player, that didn't happen. The only thing swtching thru my Onkyo A/V Receiver is the the unpconvert dvd player.Tried connecting the output from the switch directly to the TV, that works, but now I have to rerig all the audio outputs of the DVD Players thru to the receiver to get sound thru my A/V unit completely defeating the purpose of 1 HDMI cable carrying the audio and video thru the switch. If all you are doing is connecting devices dirctly to your tv, then this is switch is ok, but if you really want to be able to hook up all your units thru a Audio Video Receiver and get the audio-video fidelity promised by HDMI, then this is not the switch to buy.Finally, I tried to give this unit a zero rating, but Amazon doesn't allow that."
1,Not as pictured,The remote control is not as pictured. It is a deception. It is the same remote as pictured with other similar products. Immediately broke.Do not be deceived The seller of this product has no morals Other reviewers must all work for this shameless company.
5,"Nana Puddin""",I had a smooth and easy tranaction with this seller. My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition. I definietly would do business with this seller again.
3,Just a so-so product,"I got one of these many years ago and frankly I am surprised to see that they haven't ""awfuled"" themselves off the market. The software is mediocre at best, and the interface is clunky. The physical size of the thing is imposing, and honestly it doesn't serve much of a purpose once you get past the novelty. It doesn't do anything a lot better than CD sleeve based binders do if you are the least bit organized. If you just toss CDs on your desk and lose track of them, this might benefit you, but I have every driver disc from every bit of hardware I own all in a binder with the original sleeve and serial number and if I didn't have this product I wouldn't miss it at all.As another reviewer said, if this had functionality that it took a drive letter and allowed us to use it as a drive where i could call up disc #37 and run it, I would be thrilled with it. This is really a novelty item with little value add functionality."
2,SADD IT SWELLED,THEY ARE SO MUCH FUN WHEN YOU GET THEM-BUT THEY SWELL OVER TIME-AND do not work properly-SAD-THEY NEED TO BE MORE STERILE-TO LAST!!!
2,Gottfried Dulias might be a fraud,"Like many, I first encountered Herr Dulias at a local airshow and bought his book. Beyond the fact that it's a thoroughly unedited heap of typos, there are deeper questions among expert historians as to his legitimacy. His accounts of air warfare are scanty at best. Even in the book ""The German Aces Speak,"" there's no mention of Dulias anywhere in the seemingly thorough accounting of all German WW2 pilots' victories.Dr. Jochen Prien, JG 53 historian, puts it rather succinctly in this string:[...]Another enterprising soul, Thijs Lepstra, has undertaken a point-by-point examination of Dulias' account -- with disappointing findings:[...]So ... there's that."
3,former student,"Although, on the one hand, it is more one man's account of his intellectual life in Postmodernity than an actual account of Postmodernism; on the other, this book is useful in the sense that it familiarizes the reader with some key terms and ideas. It is a very lucid book.If you thought Russell's History of Philosophy was a good way to actually understand intellectual history, then this book is for you. If not, then like reading Russel you will either find it amusing or not."
1,Not what it claims to be!,"Don't waste your money. Most sections are extremely brief with little substance, however I was astonished that the author uses part of Proverbs 31 to claim that God requires all wives to work for pay and not ""waste"" our ""gifts"". She even goes so far as to say that putting your kids in daycare is allowing some other woman to use her ""gifts"". In my humble opinion, this book is feminism in sheeps clothing!"
5,cult classic? why not wider interest...,"I've loved this film from my first watching many moons of Jupiter ago...watching it again has me appreciating it even more, the true hallmark of a classic film! [one of my] fav quotes of any film ever just has to be: ""you're starting to sound like a g-dd-mn poodle!"" and the entire dialog subsequent in that same scene bears comparison to the finest Woody Allen...see it and weep! w/laughter...Alex 'just another bleary-eyed vidwatcher'"
2,...started good ended great but...,"...The whole scene with them underground with the ""clown faces"" was boring and utterly ridiculous to me. I loved the banter between Vic and Blood...very funny!!! I understand that A BOY AND HIS DOG is a wild, kinky and darkly hilarious cinematic adventure when it came out 35 years ago but it just wasnt entertaining to me. The best part of the movie is the ending when Vic and Blood enjoy their meal...LOL!"
4,One of my favorite scifi movies,"At first I was a little dissappointed with this copy of the movie. It didn't play smoothly its first time through, but it seems to play fine now(MAGIC). After having looked around quite a bit, this is probably one of he better copys of the movie. As much as I'd like, I don't think there is a Criterion Collection version, heheh."
1,Can You Spell Rip-off?,"It's my own fault for buying this unknown. I was hoping for an anamorphic copy. But I received the same crappy letter-boxed print that's been around for years. But this one is the absolute worst I have ever seen this movie look. Out of focus,soft,noisy,just terrible. The best copy of this movie remains the U.K. Arrow Films release. It's true anamorphic,starts out 2:35 but changes to 1:78 after the titles clear. It does run 3 minutes shorter then the letter-boxed version,but it's better picture quality and anamorphic format make it very desirable if your a fan of this movie. Please don't waste your money on this issue."
4,A boy and his telepathic dog roam the wasteland. EXELENT!,Fans of post-apocalyptic flicks and low-budget films will enjoy this. I rented it for 49 cents and kepted it a week. great movie.
2,Cute but impractical,"Because there is no stretch, the back slips off your foot when you take a step or go up stairs. Really cute shoes but they just don't work."
2,what!!,how did it get 4 stars this movie aint FUNNY!! martin should just stop actin cause he sucks the only funny person that made me laugh was his crackhead friend and he played a short role. yo just watch this on tv dont even rent it or buy it or even better dont waste ur time.
2,"A bit misleading title, with a tidbits of useful information","If you thinking about buying this book for tips on cruising in a multihull it will be extremely disappointed. If your thinking about buying and cruising in a multihull it will give some food for thought about what you need for a boat.It's an average book that reads more into design instead of what the title leads you to believe and some of the information is out of date for the faster designs by K. Hughes, J. Shuttleworth, D. Newick. Chris White has a book (amazon has it for sale) which is far better and suggested reading by most Multihull fanatics."
1,Loving the Spirit,The older they got the better they are. Except they should have never disbanded jojo gunne
2,Bodum 5670 Antigua Burr Grinder,"2 stars is maybe a little misleading. This grinder produces a beautiful, consistent grind. It introduced me to the importance of grind not only in producing a good cup of coffee, but in getting the most from your beans. However:The bean bowl is inexplicably huge. You can only use the full grinding cycle for 2 consecutive runs or the motor will overheat. Plan accordingly. Within a short period of time, the locking tabs on the bowl broke off, meaning I could no longer easily adjust the grind and I had to hold the bean bowl in place while grinding. Nevertheless, I continued to grind coffee for about 16 months until it recently died for good. Static electricity was also a problem. I was not happy with Bodum documentation or service.If you are very careful with the bean bowl and can figure out how to keep the bean grind path clean, then you can get along with this grinder. You can't knock the consistency of grind on this machine and the rich flavors it produces."
1,Grind,The major problem with this unit is that it does not grind fine enough. It only has 3 grind setting and the finest is to course for expresso. We are now stuck with a boat anchor.
5,Work Great with NO problems,I've owned this product for 5 years and use it several times a week and have never had any problems with it PERIOD. So I can't understand what all the quality complaints are??
3,Great headphones but...,"...but they died on me. After a lil over a year of use, the right side just died. I didn't overuse them either, they got a good bit of use for sure, but they spent a lot of time just resting in my drawer. The sound was great! Loud with a lot of clarity and superb bass reproduction. I listen to a lot of Jungle, Drum & Bass and Dubstep and these headphones handled it all with ease.But, just like other Audio Technicas I've had, the right side gives out after a while. I recently bought Pioneer HDJ-1000s so I wont be going back to these.For the price though, look into some lower end Sennheisers. The HD-280s are pretty ballin."
1,FRAUD,"One word... FRAUD! This book has pretty much nothing to do with Italian witch craft. Grimassi simply did a little research and then filled in the incredibly large blanks with his imagination. Italian witch craft is not Wicca, but it is amusing to see his little drawings of Italians in poses reserved for Wiccans."
5,Manners with Meaning,"This book is excellent; it provides the motivation and reasoning for good manners. Practical and readable, it spans all aspects of living a well-mannered life that pleases the Lord, your family, and your world."
4,For the Working (and not Wannabe) Writer,"Tom Piccirilli's slim ""Welcome to Hell"" is a good introduction to the writing business from a working writer. As Piccirilli states in the introduction, this is not a ""How To"" book. His tips about the writing business are not for the weak of heart--Piccirilli doesn't mince words. With chapter titles such as ""I Could Be a Bestseller But I Just Don't Have the Time,"" you can be assured that you're getting real advice here and not just the usual ""how to"" tips and tricks for breaking into the business. It may be only 68 pages, so if you're looking for more advice I would recommend Stephen King'sOn Writingas a supplement."
2,Book ends in middle of storyline,"I only give this a 2 star because as reviewer one stated it depicts a depressing and lonely life of a middle aged woman with empty nest syndrome, but mainly because just as the storyline was picking up and was about to prove an interesting plot, it ends, just like that, leaving me wonder why and what happened. I listened to all the credits hoping there was a Book 2, but there was not. An okay read, but one I certainly could have done without."
4,Worked Great,"I bought this case so I could use my iPod Classic 6G on the beach and not have to worry about sand or water scratching or ruining it. It did that just fine. I don't know if I would go swimming with my iPod, but I did feel better with this tough (albeit bulky) case.The membrane works great too, very easy to turn the clickwheel."
5,Mind and Intelligence,"Almost impossible to comprehend the supreme genius and the mind of Joseph Needham. His concepts of biochemistry were far far ahead of his time: cellular organization. integrative levels, and other vast concepts. To learn Chinese in middle age, study it exhaustively and publish the definitive history of Chinese science. Think of it! His biology rules today. His philosophy and mysticism likewise. History is not yet over.....maybe, but mind survives. Donald Macdonald"
5,"Great Ideas, Great Writing, Great Read","This book arrives with perfect timing with very compelling subject matter - a look at the state of affairs for populist politics and a broad comparison to the republican machine.And while I expected the book to provide a sophisticated analysis on the current political infrastructure (and it delivered), I didn't expect was how good the writing would be - and how compelling their ideas are."
4,"Fascinating, maddening read","This book covers much of the political situation for the last six years. It will madden, disgust the reader, but enlighten , too. I was only disappointed that the authors didn't seem to have any real suggestions to Crash the Gate.However since the book was published before the 2006 elections, it appears that much was successful in that task. It explains, too why the Democratic party in DC was unhappy about the final results of that election. But we are happy, though."
3,It was alright,"It was just not what I was looking for. I like movies more than plays, but for a play he did a good job."
2,This is only a stage play; not a cinematic production,"I didn't realize upon ordering that this was not a cinematic production.Stage plays bore me.I turned it off within 20 minutes but, perhaps upon future observation the great reviews it recieved will prove to be true."
3,neutral review,"since i don't like murder mysteries, i am going to give this book a ""neutral"" review....I'm not putting it down, but i'm not putting it up on a pedestal either."
3,not his best,"first i would like to say b.b. is one of my all time favorites and at 80 years of age he whips up on guys half his age, having said that this concert just has a tired feeling to it, in fact my favorite parts are his story telling and his easy way with the audience. his guitar playing is less than inspired and jeff beck is a bit of a downer, his guitar solos are sloppy and just plain odd, would it be asking to much if he just played it straight for once."
4,Enjoyable film,"I saw this in the theater and thought it was quite enjoyable and fun. It was well made, directed, and acted, with many funny moments. It was also endearing as the Elliot character really learns who he is. The best thing about this movie...they stuck to the story of how Woodstock ended up in this town. No actors dressed up to look like the musicians who played Woodstock. I was concerned it would turn into a what musician can we throw in and such, but it wasn't thankfully.Definitely worth watching."
2,A bit disappointing,"So, there's some nice stories about Funakoshi and his masters, all with some kind of morality in them. Well, not that bad. Than there's the presentation of Ten No Kata. So, that's interesting because this Kata is not practiced anymore formally in the JKA and few karatekas even know it exists, and personnaly I think it's a great method of training basics. So at least the book shows this kata, but the performer has (seems to me) a very weak technique compared to the performer in karate-do kyohan the master's text (see this title). Sometimes the postures and techniques seem to be shocking for modern shotokan standards. Maybe it has to do with the evolution of shotokan since the book was written, but then again the performer in kyohan looks much more the way we are used to for modern shotokan karate-Do. All in all, I was a bit disappointed with this book. I give it 2 stars for the Ten No Kata and maybe a little nit for the stories."
1,What the hell is this?,"I have to say, as a Practitioner of NLP, I am also a fan of Richard Bandler. Thank God he doesn't write fiction regularly. I can honestly say that I feel DUMBER now after having read this book. I want that entire 90 minutes that I spent reading this book, BACK, not to mention my money. What a waste."
3,Douglas House,I'm impressed with this first attempt by the writer. The book is an easy read and really sets the times for us. It is easy to imagine the feelings of the writer as we take a look at London during this important time in our history. I'm sure this book will bring back memories to many African American veterans who were also forced to grow up in a hurry when exposed to the realities of the world and what it has to offer for better or worse.
2,Just watch it for Sandy.,The Net starring Sandra Bullock was a great thriller when it was released in 1995. Bullock was at the height of her career and this film was probably only a hit for that reason alone. And yes I was and still a huge fan of Bullock but I have to admit The Net is very dated and silly now. The plotline is a little far fetched and contrived but Bullock's spunky and fearless performance saves this boring little film.
2,A horrible movie,"This movie has a far-fetched and completely wrong idea of what technology is and how it works. It is based only in hollywood. Everything in the movie is geared to make the viewer think that this can happen right now, just outside your door (maybe to your neighbor); however, the integration of technology they display does not exist -- and in my opinion never will as long as people have differing opions on how to implement technology.I'd recommend this movie to anyone without anything better to do and who likes the countanence of Sandra -- she is perhaps the only saving grace of this movie. END"
3,A very average thriller,"So Sandra Bullock is such a computer geek that no one knows who she really is? If you can swallow that premise then you may be able to enjoy this standard offering from producer irwin Winkler. To be honest the premise of the young woman who has her identity wiped and has to go on the run is fine, if slightly implausible; the overall effect is just not that exciting. Jeremy Northam is suitably slimy as the bad guy and Sandra does a fair scared but fiesty routine. But the film makers don;t seem to be aware that typing on computers is not a thrilling thing to watch. Sandra Bullock running around is, but not when her efforts are not done justice. Overall this ticks off all the required perils but if you've seen The Pelican Brief, then this is pretty much the same thing."
3,Dated,"I just picked this up at the store and had never heard of it before. My wife and I watched it tonight and enjoyed it, but for 2010 it's really dated! Large cell phones, CRT monitors, lousy on-screen graphics, floppy disks, etc. But the story was good and kept you involved. No doubt this was more relevant in 1995. If you haven't seen it and you like Sandra, then I think you will enjoy it."
4,Decent quality with good price,"It works fine with my Brother HL-2040 printer. I have been using it for 1 week with print of 50 - 100 pages, but so far still don't see any problem."
2,I found this book very frustrating.,I would like to say I lost intrest in this book because it took so long to get into the guts of it and was dispointed with the emotional side of the story.
4,Excellent read.,John Marsden places you in modern day rural Australia when the country is suddenly invaded. Unprepared and illequiped the nation begins to fall under their control. A group of teenagers miss the invasion while camping deep in the Australian wild. They return to their empty homes and slowly realise what has happened.Their goal is to free their families and help take back what is theirs.The series is a fantastic read and I recommend it for the young and the old.
4,Interesting,"Interesting premise from an alternate reality point of view. Read the book first and then saw the movie, and I actually preferred the movie."
5,This book captures war like never seen before.,"This book is fantastic, you get into it and you just stop reading. After reading it you will want to read the rest of the series. All the books in this series are heart warming. There is even a romance in all the fighting. I garentee you will love it."
5,This is the BEST BOOK in the WORLD!!!!!!!,oh my god this book and the 2 sequels after it were the very best books I had ever read! This book is sutable for any teenager and is so interesting that you can't put the book down from start to finish!!!!!! Does anyone know when the fourth book comes out in Canada???????
5,so exciting!!,"John Marsden has done an excellent job creating a great and exciting story about friendship, war, and love. I have read all the books in this series and I was so mad when it ended. You feel so close to the charactors that when it's over, its heartbreaking. I wish I could meet every one of the charactors on the book. This series truly has changed my life. I've learned so much and it has changed the way I feel about a war. Now that I know first hand what people go through in a war, I'll never doubt the affects again."
4,A sharp reminder about the brittle world we live in,"It's not an easy task to write a review of a book like this one. It is of course hypothetical, but the memories of WWII are still too real, and this book definitely does bring them up.The narrative is very personal and natural. The author makes no attempt to write in ""teenager's style"", but it comes out this way flawlessly, which makes the situation very real.Thank you!"
5,"Great Lyrics, Terrific Sound","This is another great album in the tradition of Rebecca St. James.She has combined deeply spiritual lyrics with a great sound. Rebecca certainly has an amazing voice and it delivers a sonic delight with this collection.There are several standout songs. I particularly like Shadowlands, Take All of Me, and Love Being Loved By You. The lyrics on a couple of the songs are incredibly moving.One other song that really deserves special notice is 'Beautiful Stranger' which is a tribute to the great work done by Compassion International. I would recommend this song, this album, and helping Compassion by donating money or sponsoring a child."
3,NOT UP TO REBECCA PAR,"I MUST SAY, I AM A AVID REBECCA ST. JAMES FAN! I LOVE ALMOST ALL HER OTHER CD'S BUT THIS ONE IS LACKING. THE LYRICS ON MOST OF THE SONGS JUST DONT TOUCH MY HEART LIKE PAST CD'S, WITH EXCEPTION TO ""LEST I FORGET"". ALSO IT SEEMS THE WORDS AND MUSIC JUST DONT 'FLOW' LIKE HER PREVIOUS STUFF. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE. I LISTEN TO HER 'PRAY' CD, AND 'LIVE WORSHIP' ALL THE TIME, BUT FIND MYSELF RARELY GETTING THIS ONE OUT!!"
4,The wait is over,"Rebecca's last studio album was back in 2002 with the Worship God cd.Now her long waited new release is out. I thought that the cd was pretty good. God help me, Alive, Shadowlands, Beautiful stranger, Thank you, and Take all of me being the stand-out tracks for me. To me, it isn't as good as Transform or Pray but still a wonderful release from Rebecca St. James."
5,genius,"Wonderful book, and incredibly funny. Apt account of the immigrant's life in the US. A must read for all Nigerians."
3,Good but not the best,"The speakers are okay. The sound is decent. I wish it would go a little loud though...but since there is no volume contral you can't. The quality isn't that bad but not the best. It is worth about what you are going to have to pay for it. I would say buy it if you are looking for cheap speakers that are ""good enough"" because that is what these are."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book on the topic. The author approaches the subject from a practial point of view. There are good examples on how to use NN with real world problems (i.e.: using perceptrons for character recognition). A good reference to have. However I would not recommend trying to code the algorithms yourself, but rather use a NN package ."
5,Legendary,"What could be said in favor of Henry Cartier-Bresson else that what was already said? The man was a legend and every word about his genius was already spoken, written or thought along the ages thus all commentaries are unnecessary!"
4,its ok,"When I finished ""Valley of the Horses"" I could not wait to read her next book about the trials and tribulations that were going to happen to them. As I this book, I was disappointed that she was so involved in the sex and every action of it. I felt that this book would have been just was good without the trashy sex in it."
2,Enough is enough!,"That is what I felt after finishing this book. The qualityand interest of the series has been continuously decliningsince the first book. The idea behind the series is extraordinary and the first book is excellent. I could not wait to see what will happen to Ayla... But then, Ayla's character becomesso disproportionately strong that shadows the other elementsof the story and undermines its credibility. I suspect Ayla is a projection of the author'sinner heroine, with everything he wants to be. A nice job indestroying an initially lovable character. After this book I do not care about Ayla anymore! And it's a pitty because I think that the ideaand the first book deserved a much better follow-up.Two more books to go: I do not think I can stand moresuper-Ayla!"
3,500 pages of beating around the bush,"The third in the series. 600 odd pages, and 500 too many. The last one hundred though are worth the whole book. Nothing much happens, and it's just a 500-page beating around the bush to get to the much expected finale where we know if Ayla, the heroine of the series, will end up with one guy or the other. A soap-operish triangle practically all through. Again, as in the second part of the series, our modern mores are present in the characters of this 25,000 year old story, taking away any credibility we may want to give it. A lot of study and detail has gone into the writing of these books, one has to admit, but the characters' interaction and the societies depicted are only late 20th century societies without Internet or electricity. It's an easy read though, and if you make it through most of the book I recommend that you finish it. A few of the last pages are beautiful and poetic, an artistic inspiration, a few drops of the human soul."
1,I`m done,I`ll just make up my own story for the fourth book.After reading this one I`m afraid to get the next one.Sure skimmed over alot of pages!
2,distractingly bad,"between the quality of the writing going downhill and the kindle edition having so many typos and misprints, i had a hard time enjoying this book."
1,Too tedious for words,"If Ayla was really as smart as she's supposed to be, she wouldn't be appearing in any more sequels.The love triangle is straight out of daytime TV: ""he acts one way, but for some reason I'll just assume he feels completely the opposite"". Ayla's accent is continuously described as too small to notice...but everyone does the instant she opens her mouth. Everyone in the book is just great, except for the token one-dimensional bad-guy who turns good in the end.These savages are so elegant, we expect to see a pre-historic Martha Stewart behind the next mammoth hide. Ayla is already Amelia Earhardt, Joan of Arc and Mother Teresa rolled into one. Read it if it's the only book in the house (this includes the dictionary and the phonebook)."
5,Doesn't Disappoint,I love the Earth's Children series and re-read them often. The Mammoth Hunters is overall very entertaining and interesting. One compaint is that Ayla is supposedly so tuned in to the nuances of posture and expression that it's difficult to believe she could misread Jodalar so badly. But that's really the only complaint about this installment of Earth's Children -- obviously I love it if I gave it five stars!
4,Auel maintains the fantasy,"Many reviews have already been written about this book, I'll just add that Jean Auel has done a good job of maintaining the fictional prehistoric world. I especially enjoy reading about the food, clothing, and rituals. I know it's pure fiction, but its still fun to enter that world."
2,Go Back to Czechoslovakia and do more research,"Clan of the Cave Bear was excellent, though a little hard to chew. What happened with the rest of the series? I found Valley and Mammoth to be lost among the reeds and both novels could have been paraphrased within a few pages to spare us the outre desires and lusts ill-afforded to cave women, much less to any enlightened female in this age."
1,Kindle edition,Riddled with INCESSANT typos. These continual errors make reading the Kindle version of this novel painful. It's disrespectful to charge money for such a flawed product.
3,You can't be everything,"I think the book was good. But I have to admit that it's rather boring when Ayla can do everything, I mean there is nothing she can't do. I liked the book because it's fun to read about when they hunt and travell to meet other people."
3,Sólo si desean continuar la SERIE.,"Un resúmen:El clan del oso cavernario: EXCELENTE, INSPIRADOR.El valle de los caballos: BUENA SECUELA, RECOMENDABLE.Los cazadores del mamut: SOLO PARA FANS. Repite algunas recetas, aunque mantiene el interés.El libro de los viajes (""Plains""): REPETITIVO, LENTO Y ABURRIDO EN DOS TERCERAS PARTES (LA'ÚLTIMA PARTE, COMO EN ""cazadores"", PARA FANS).....LA ESPERANZA....""The Shelter of stone""...donde los que admiramos a Ayla, esperamos reencontrarnos con ella..."
3,Love lorn,"This book is slow and very distracting.Ayla gets herself into too many weird,but wonderfull situations.She does with Ranec what we wish we could do with people that we see that are diffrent and wonder,what if.But it backfires on her because she does not understand the concept of being jealous.In the end it sorts it's self out but it made for a tedious read,very good but with patience,the next book make up for it."
5,Kitchen Aid Artisan Mixer,"Shipping time was slower than expected, but it was free shipping, so I can complain. Mixer was well packaged."
2,a careless reporter,"Randall Sullivan gets in his own way in this book. He set out a reporter and ended up a what? seeker?I found myself annoyed by sloppy reporting: a Jesuit who gave Sullivan the name of someone to see in Rome--misspelled that Jesuit's name. Mislabeled Condoleeza Rice's job. Misspelled ""pilgrimage."" ""Career"" appears where ""careen"" is intended.Sullivan is great when he's reporting, even in his sloppy mode, but his emoting--well, that's another story best told in another place.Interesting read, but I got it from the library, not the bookstore."
1,Warning:If you are a Catholic!,"Please understand that apparitions like Medjugorje and Garabandal are not approved by the Catholic church.Those behind these movements go ahead despite this fact.If you dont believe me,you can check it on Google.The church advises you not to get distracted by such teachings and messages.Beware!If you want to know more about church approved apparitions of the blessed Virgin,you may check out those at Soufanieh,Damascus.or [...] for details."
3,The Miracle Detective,"The author is respectful in his presentation of his investigations, but he gives very little in attributions for his sources. To cite just one case, opinions are stated as being held by the Holy Father, but we aren't told how the author came to this knowledge. I wish the author had provided footnotes detailing his sources, because we are left with just taking his word for a lot of things.There is some very coarse language in the book, and a situation of child sexual abuse is detailed. Also, the horrors of the war in Bosnia are delved into thoroughly.I wanted to write this review, so that nobody would buy this book without realising what they would be getting. I would recommend ""A Still, Small Voice: A Practical Guide on Reported Revelations""by Fr.Benedict J. Groeschel as a better alternative."
4,shows a deep understanding of science fiction themes,"As a longtime science fiction fan, I thought I was reasonably versed in the main themes of this field. But Moylan's critique is at a far deeper level than my usual comprehension of science fiction. He writes at an analytic depth that shows a deep appreciation and awareness.For you to get the most benefit from his book, you should already have a background in traditional English literature, as well as science fiction. The utopias and dystopias he studies in the latter are correlated and contrasted to themes already present in the broader literature. Unfortunately, I lack that traditional background, and so much of his arguments were lost on me."
5,good grout remover,"This item works well. However, you have to have a steady hand. It really serves its purpose."
4,Start off slow,The blade easily bends if you start too close to wall but can be straightened carefully. Must pull slowly but it did the job
2,Who would have thought,"This book looks good from the outside. When you read the back it sounds good and then when actually get down to the business of reading disappointment will soon follow. The main characther Elaine has this annoying habit of having her thoughts follow a scene. The story line is very predictable, just your average run of the mill girl meets girl and falls in love, girl cheats on girl, girl ends up falling in love with other girls sister. It is in no way believable. The mother is supposed to be gay and then both her daughters are gay, come on this is not real. The lesbianism is played for all it's worth. In the end this is just another dime store romance. I could have had a V-8."
1,If I can vote negative stars I would!,"I bought this set over the weekend from Target for $19.99 and it was one of the worst purchases I have ever made in my life! The cover looked fun so I got suckered. Don't let it fool you, too!! It was labeled ""Beginner Level"" but it had to have been made for people with ""special needs"" in mind. I don't want to be mean but there are no words to describe how awful this DVD set is.If you are still interested in purchasing, I will sell it to you for $1 plus shipping!!"
5,A classic!!!,"This CD definitely lived up to my expectations. I especially loved the track ""Baila que baila"", it is Jose Alberto ""El Canario"" at his best. The track is absolutely fantastic, with a great upbeat hard salsa style. ""Somos dos"" is a great duet with Azuquita and El Canario. Only con to the album is the merengue they included ""Mujer Dominicana"" that I don't understand why they did that. Other than that, the album is great."
5,Works great!,"This stuff works great on coffee pots! Cleans out the whole system, you wouldn't believe the stuff it pulls up! Just be sure to run regular water through your machine several times before actually making coffee. Highly recommended, works better than vinegar!"
5,Coffee never tasted so good,"I've used this item a few times in a technivorm moccamaster and what a difference it makes. It is very easy to use. Just follow the instructions and flush several tanks of water through. It does a good job of cleaning the heating element which helps restore that piping hot coffee. Also cleaned the residue from my gold mesh filter and stainless carafe. After brewing, I used the water to clean my stainless steel coffee mugs as well (joemo).My wife didn't know that I had cleaned all of the equipment. The next morning I made her a cup of coffee and headed off to work. She actually sent me a message at work telling me how much better her coffee was morning. Hard to argue with those results."
5,Does exactly what it says,Great product. Cleaned my coffee pot and Kurig with this and was very happy with the outcome. I like that it cleans without the nasty smell of vinegar filling my kitchen!
1,Background hiss ruins the experience,"The Marengo Films edition of The Kennel Murder Case has fairly good picture quality throughout most of the movie. Unfortunately, most of the scenes are ruined by a pronounced background hiss on the audio track. Whenever this noise cuts in, it takes the viewer right out of the story.The other movie on this disc, British Intelligence, has a somewhat softer visual image. However, its audio track is relatively clear."
1,Would be beautiful if I could get one undamaged!,"My mom ordered this crib for us as a gift. It arrived damaged (scuff marks on curved part at top & chunk of wood missing around inner hardware). We shipped it back and waited for a replacement. The replacement crib arrived today -- also damaged (scuff marks on curved part at top and chunk of wood missing near bottom of leg)! I am returning the 2nd crib and will NOT request a replacement. This has been a big waste of time and effort. It's too bad, because most of the crib was really beautiful.ETA: Do NOT order this crib -- All are damaged. After receiving and returning 2 damaged cribs, I was told by Amazon that they can not ship me another replacement. They said that the entire shipment from their supplier is defective. I don't know why they are still offering this item for sale on their website. Maybe they are hoping that some customers will accept the defective cribs without complaint."
4,"So Far, So Good!","We are still expecting our little angel Kaley, but we did just buy this crib. It was not that bad for daddy and I to put together. The front piece looked like we were going to have to put it in backwards, but, by some magic, it works the way the directions say it should! I would say it took us about an hour. We did have to use a drill, they did not line up a few of the holes correctly, but all in all, it was fine. It looks great in our room, and I can't wait to see our baby in it!"
4,houston is off da hezzy,this is a great album i listen to it every day it my be cause i think that he is fine maybe cause i think he has a nice voice or maybe even both but this is an album worth buying
3,This was a good first album,"Houston's album is that good. I was surprised. I liked I Like That and it's hip-hop sounds, but the rest of the album is just as superb. I love his remake of Ready For The World's Love Me Down--that was the JAM back in 1986! He really tore it up on there and they were smart to update some lyrics to today to keep it from being dated. The other songs are strong and showcase his voice more. He's not quite there yet musically, but the next album, he will find other people to broaden his vocal stylings and talents."
2,Under powered and hard to clean,"There is only one size grater with this machine and it is very fine. We talked with company to see if we could get a larger grate, which is not available. This machine is way slower than grating by hand. It will grate hard cheese and soft cheeses, but forget about trying to clean it afterwards. Its 10 minutes to get the grater out of the machine.We gave it away to the salvation army after a trying it for a few weeks."
1,you've got to be kidding me...,"People make me laugh. Seriously.Harry Potter is satanic???? The books are exposing innocent children to the ""dark side""?? Haha. Wow. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. What is wroing with the world today? Harry Potter is a fictional story written for entertainment value, with NO refrence or even hints of ""evil wicca"". I think more ""Opposers"" need to actually read the Harry Potter books before reading the Anti-Harry Potter Books."
1,This product does not exist.,"If you ordered this product, you should probably cancel the order. There is no CD version of this single, only a 12"" vinyl. I already notified Amazon of this problem so the item will most likely be removed eventually."
5,A great little camera,"While some people call this a point and shoot camera it is much more than that. It takes pictures of stunning crispness that easily enlarge to 8x10 with no problem. Using an adapter ring you can put filters on the camera. I added a circular polarizer to mine. This camera is trustworthy, reliable, easy to use and taking pictures with it can become a totally intuitive process. My only problem with it is a problem a lot of other similar cameras would have- and that is that the display screen is not protected from glare so sometimes under certain lighting conditions you cannot easily see the image you are taking. I compensate for this by taking ""Hail Mary"" type shots and most of the time I get useable images. I have also learned to take an extra set of batteries with me when doing a lot of photographic work in one day. I shot most of the time at ISO 400 and had no problems with noise. I did a lot of close-ups of flowers and got really nice images. A great little camera!"
1,"Worked great, until it broke!","Exactly 1 year and 1 month after purchasing this camera, the flash stopped working. The warranty expires after one year, so I took the camera in to a local shop. They said that the problem was in the CPU of the camera and they would have to send the camera back to Olympus.Fine, except Olypus charges $250 to fix the camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Can you believe it!??!?! I'm OUTRAGED!"
3,"Wonderful Quality, but tough to lug around","Not the type of camera for a casual user, but wonderful for taking nature shots (as long as you've figured out the zoom, which can take a while). My biggest troubles are that the LCD screen drains batteries almost instantly, it can be difficult to figure out, it's heavier than I'd like, and I have a big problem finding a case to carry the camera in that doesn't feel like a second purse. The quality of my pictures is the only thing keeping this camera from being replaced with a smaller, more portable type for traveling."
5,Great online reading.,This book has just been published online and bears careful reading. Richard W. Kropf has produced an interactive experience with questions at the end of each chapter inviting the reader to enter into dialogue with the author. Definitely a must-read and a book that needs to be re-published and in the libraries of all seekers.
4,There's a Reason That It's Fuzzy.,"The reason the show looks the way it does is because of the era. Many shows in the '80s were filmed and then edited on videotape, which gives it that fuzzy look. It's a lot easier to restore film than video. It's sad it looks this way, but that's just the way it is. Some of you have mentioned that Twin Peaks is amazing restoration - it is because it was shot and edited on film.I wish the show looked better, but I'm still happy to have them, especially since I never thought Paramount would release them. Be honest: Did you ever think this would be released?"
2,"Excellent show, disappointing DVD set","Has anyone noticed the fine print on the back of the DVD case which says that some of the episodes have been edited from their original broadcast versions? That concerns me. Also, the sound is awful!! Mono? I taped every episode on VHS from the Sci Fi channel years ago and they are in stereo with very good picture quality. I was hoping to have an official set which would be better than that. I'm disappointed."
3,Inferior Video Picture,"Amazon.com is the best, Received dvd set fast. Picture quality poor, If you have a HDTV expect to see hazy picture, I still enjoyed the show. Do Not expect to see a HD picture."
5,A Great Series From The Late 80's,"I just recently saw reruns of Friday the 13th the series on Chiller and I enjoyed watching the couple of episodes I seen. So I went out and Bought The first two seasons. I am in the process of watching Season One and I love it! The Cast is Great together!I like that they had the Character of Mickie be skeptical and sort of a non believer at first of the supernatural/curses. I have read people say the video quality is not that great..I myself do not have any complaints about the video quality..I think they did the best that could to try and clean up the video as best as they could. The pilot episode was great with the ""Doll""! If you are a fan of shows dealing in the horror genre then this is the series to get! I myself give it 5 stars!"
5,Easy to read,"Very easy to read. Examples are simple and effective. The book explains the statistical concepts as well as the SAS programming tricks. In fact, the book provides complete code - you will be able to get good amount of analysis done just by copying that code. However, you also need to buy the ""The Little SAS Book"" if you never used SAS before."
2,Disappointing,"Terrific material, but not very good documentary. This film feels like it was put together quickly, without a lot of insight into the fascinating story of Music Hall Days. Hope someone will try again."
5,The very definition of cyberpunk.,"When people talk about ""cyberpunk"", they're usally refering to one of two things. The first is Blade Runner, and the other is Neuromancer. Read it. Read it twice, because unless you're Albert Einstein or William Gibson, you're going to miss stuff and get confused, especially towards the end. The pace is incredible, but the world is totally believable, and even though the plot isn't the greatest, it's one heck of a ride."
4,Cyber Cowboys,"Just as Easy Rider defined the generation of the 1960's, Gibson's science fiction novel may very well define the 1990's era. Though at times a little too dark and murky for its own good, nontheless Gibson spins a tale that ""jacks in"" to the collective unconciousness of the computer generation. A solid science fiction novel that combines the best of the genre with new issues relative to the devleopment of world wide networking. A must read for all students of the web"
5,Book one of three,"All I have to say is after you read this, read Count Zero and then read Mona Lisa....they all tie in together"
1,Gave Up Halfway,"I love science fiction. I am also a pretty open-minded and forgiving reader who enjoys a full gamut of what society considers ""high"" or ""lowbrow"" writing.This book was awful. The concept must have been interesting at the time it was written, however I found the execution just terrible. It comes off as disjointed, pretentious, shallow, and just plain dull. I wish I could have seen why others admire it so much."
2,"Hard to follow, visualize, or believe","I really tried. Got about a quarter of the way in and then realized I didn't remember anything that got me to that point in the story. I was just reading the words in order and not retaining anything. It just didn't excite me or engage me. Too many characters are shuffled in and out without explanation or reason. Had to flip back to previous pages to remember who they were and where from. The dialogue is very vague with regards to who is speaking and who they are speaking too. I put it down and looked up the plot on wikipedia to orient myself and try to continue. I was even more confused by the plot summary there. Sorry, not gonna finish this one."
4,They've got Spy-Tech!,"If you're a fan of science fiction, or think you might want to explore the sub-genre of cyberpunk fiction, Neuromancer is an essential read. However, this doesn't mean it's the greatest read you'll ever experience.Neuromancer features a convoluted plot and a host of characters so flat you'll be able to distinguish them only by their signiture traits (I admit, I found it pretty tough to keep them all straight).Neuromancer's best selling-point, however, is its phenomenal world-building and speculative technology. Gibson represents cyberspace in the graphical ""Lawnmower Man"" vein which has all but died in more recent literature (see Tad Williams' Otherland for a more recent stab at this depiction); the city (district?) of Chiba, on the other hand, where the action begins, is vividly detailed and vibrant.Enjoy the book's love of technology, deal with the plot and characters. It's a short, fun read."
2,"Entertaining, but completely shallow","Hot chicks with bio-mod razor nails? Shallow characters, shallow world. None of the humor, quirkiness, and philosophical insights as authors like Philip K. Dick, Lem, or Alfred Bester. Mostly style, very little substance. If Cyberpunk were a type of Rock & Roll it'd be 80's glam, lipstick & hair bands. Oodles of D&D; Nerd 'Cool Factor'with hardly the philosophical intrigue of the highly derivative Matrix trilogy. While I'm sure this is blasphemy to the cyberpunk fans everywhere, the chip on my shoulder left by books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash is taking Geek Chic at face value, and realizing there's nothing behind the curtain--nothing beneath the sunken eyes of drug addicts and biotech junkies.More deserving of a comic book than a novel! Then again, I can see why this would have had more impact in the 1980s when it was originally published."
4,The Original Cyberpunk,"First off, I have to say that I was introduced to this novel by seeing, loving and researching The Matrix. I believe that the movie was just absolutely fantastic and amazing and any other adjective that I can think of (Just not at the moment). So, I picked up this book from the library to see what it was all about.It was pretty good basically sums it up. It had innovative settings and ideas and was generally awesome all around, but I just didn't like how sometimes certain technologies were never explained or were only barely mentioned. That's fine if it is just mentioned in passing, but when you linger on them and detail them without saying what they actually do, that kind of frustrated me.Other than that, this book was what I like to call perfect. Everything about it was expertly crafted and written, and I highly recommend it to people interested in cyperbunk or just basic science fiction."
4,Not as bad as you might think,"When I first tried to read this book, I thought it was absolutely terrible. Some time later, I gave it another try and found, to my surprise, that I quite liked it. It may not be technically accurate in terms of today's computer technology, and it's certainly not written in a normal style, but it is actually rather good."
2,Definitely overrated,"An interesting book (barely), even though it's difficult to read. In my opinion, it's not worth the 4 and 5 stars I've been seeing in the reviews when compared to other sci-fi masterpieces! The characters were shallow and there wasn't anything to like in them. I almost trashed the book while half-way through it (like a friend of mine did), but I stuck with it to the end. If this is one of Gibson's best, I probably won't read anything from this author ever again."
2,not surprised,"I'm not surprised that this book is being adored by critics. Confusing and bad-written,with lousy descriptions and murky characters, this book really seems like it came from the future -where some other rules of writing aplly. ""Neuromancer"" is something like ""Ulysses"" of the sf genre. You know they call it ""important"", ""master-piece"" etc., but you also know you'll never like it because it is beyond of being readable and enjoyable.When you read 200 pages of ""Neuromancer"" you still won't have a clue what is all about, who's fighting who, where, how and why? This book may pass only as a travesty of its own genre. Gibson is not innovatory writer, he's a bad writer.If you want to read this book go ahead, but I promise you won't understand much.For masochist-type readers only!"
1,Interesting ideas are no substitute for writing skills,"A few interesting ideas and a very stylistic writing mode are no substitute for character development, plot, pacing, etc.Good authors introduce a new character in such a way that you remember them. Gibson remembers to do this for a couple of characters but then seems to run out of inspiration. A series of single syllable names for pointless characters follow in dreary procession until the reader is thoroughly confused and really just doesn't give a damn about any of them.The endless attempt at a stilted post-apocalyptic writing style is just annoying. After a while, I just want to grab him by the lapels and say ""where is the hook?"".I stuck with it for 100 pages before giving up."
4,If Only Gibson Had Continued With This Story...,"This is the best of Gibson's work. It holds up after several readings and becomes richer and more mind-expanding each time you enter its world of the cyberpunk future that we're living in. Somehow, later work by Gibson doesn't quite measure up to the brilliance of ""Neuromancer,"" at least for me. Hard as I try, I can't get into the characters or even the language of Gibson's later works. I keep wanting to be jacked into the matrix of ""Neuromancer,"" back where I think I belong, back where the world as I know exists. If Gibson had simply continued with the characters from this novel, added more dimensions to the world he created, if he had done what Lawrence Durrell did in the ""Alexandria Quartet"" only from the point of view cyberspace, I think we'd all be happier. Maybe, maybe not.-Tom Maremaa, Author of the Forthcoming Novel ""Metal Heads"" from Kunati Books in Spring 2009"
4,"Excellent, very enjoyable","I was very surprised reading this book. The author really thought ahead of it's time, I think that Ghost in the Shell and Matrix have a big debt with this novel. The plot is complex and well written and is has some delicious side effects: the author names companies that were well powerful in the 80's and that he expected to be in the future but have not, for example, Telefunken."
2,Faint praise,"More atmosphere than substance. The future can already be seen to very different from what this so-called ""visionary"" author ""predicts"", so those eagerly awaiting a cyberpunk future can now return to asking ""Do you want fries with that?"""
3,Too Much Jargon to Wade Through,"I must admit I am not a frequent reader of sci-fi and had never read cyberpunk. Gibson uses great dialogue and fast-paced action to keep the reader enthralled. However, I found my interest frequently halted by Gibson's use of terms. Many parts were slow to wade through. This book explains why many people are turned off by sci-fi, they may feel as though they have to be an expert in its jargon to read a book."
4,prerequisite flawed gaudy postmodern fun,"I read Neuromancer fifteen years ago, and again last month. It remains wild and alive, painful, immature, and beautiful, like punching out a car window. If you find this first novel too complex (sheeze...) or the flashy style is too much for your low capacity head, then the rest of the world is already moving too fast to pity you. Nuff said."
1,Only God knows how hard I tried to like this book,"I had read good things about this book many times in science fiction magazines, so I decided to give it a try. Besides, I knew most of the cyberspace buzzwords, since I had bought a collectible card game based on the cyberspace concept.I quit reading after 2 chapters. The problem is that a lot of information is crammed in mostly every sentence, so reading becomes extremely tedious. Reminded me of law cases that I had to read for law school: tedious and pretentious writing, unnecessary to illustrate intellectual concepts. I had the book lingering by my bed for a few months, and I tried it a few times, but I just could not get into it.Then I checked out from the library the unabridged audiotape. I tried to listen, but the narration was so boring that I had to quit listening.What a disappointment..."
1,Say What?,This is one of few novels that I have yet to finish. Gibson recants an uninteresting story filled to the bursting point of useless jargon. If entertainment is least on your list of priorities then this book is for you.
3,"Well written, but","this story was just not of interest to me. The story ties together, but it turns out that I don't like this genre of SF."
2,"First In Its Class, Yes But...","Most reviewers of this title say that it was ""mind altering,"" and, having won the Big 3 of the genre -Hugo, Nebula & PKD- you would think it was the best of the best except I don't feel that way. I think that Gibson's later work -Count Zero, etc.- was much much better. While Gibson's was the first science fiction book to coin ""firsts"" such as the words ""cyberspace"" and ""jacking"" into the Net, consider that at the time it was originally published -1984- the entire genre of science fiction during that timeframe SUCKED. While I'll agree that Gibson singlehandedly took the genre off life support, Neuromancer left me largely unimpressed. It borrowed heavily from a title published in 1974 entitled Dhalgren. And had more people taken notice of this book, then I doubt Neuromancer would have won the accolades that it did. Read Delany's Dhalgren and you'll see exactly what I mean."
2,Meh,"These do not stay in the shoes very well unless you commit to the velcro attachment, but then you are stuck only using these for two pairs of flats and have to buy several pairs if you want to keep having supported feet. Also, even with the velcro attachment the insoles don't stay in place very well :("
1,"Awful, extremely one-sided","This man claims to give an accurate view of Christianity and Islam. This is not the case. He presents Christians as one mass group that all believe the same thing. He says that Christians are pro-life, don't believe in evolution, are extremely patriotic, and have religion affect every part of their life. Timothy George, welcome to America. Christians are not all alike."
1,A Well Intentioned Lesson in Religious Conversion,"As other reviewers have suggested, this DVD offers information filtered through a devout American Christian lens. A sincere attempt is made here to understand the basic tenants of the Muslim faith and Islamic tradition. However, the viewer gets the definite impression that this video was designed for a Midwest church fellowship meeting discussing creatures from another planet. The intent to convert the misguided Muslims into evangelical Christians is both blantant and patronizing. If you're seeking objective information, this is not your best choice. However, if your quest is for ideological justification masquerading as education, you've found the right vehicle."
3,Mah jong,"I have played better mah jong games. This is too complicated for such a simplegame...Although it is easy to win. The tiles are hard to read, andthere are games that have explanations that don't make sense."
4,solid self.,"I got to listening to soil because a neighbor told me I would like it after learning of my tastes and he was right.I was getting into drowning pool a few years ago,so this was a natural step after DP picked up their lead singer.If you like good solid sensible hard rock, you'll like drowning pool."
1,Outdated for OSX 10.2,I bought this book in hopes that I could automate my creative development process; what I got was a book that was so outdated none of the script's syntax would run. This looks like a cool book and certainly has some cool scripts if they worked in the newer version(s) of OSX. Don't buy this book if you work on anything newer than OSX 10.1
1,Very poor examples,"If you really want to understand Applescript I highly recommend you don't do like I did and waste your money on a poorly written guide. This book has a great lack of examples which actually show you the syntax of anything and you can waste hours trying to find out how to even code a simple path string in this book, which I did last week. I took my first programming classes 30 years ago in college. There are many poorly written computer books out there and this one is a classic in that category. I am just glad that Bruce Eckel and Ben Forta are much better authors (Java and ColdFusion) since I am a web developer by profession."
3,The Visitors Imaginery Friends,"This movie is eerie style, which almost fits an illusionary profile of psychology-thriller. The movie is confusing at the start, and continues to make the watcher feel confused throughout the movie, yet as the scenes come together, it seems more real and plotted well. If you want a movie that peeks curiosity, then this movie will definately peek your mind to want to see what happens...Some compare the movie to ""ghost ship,"" yet I cannot see the comparison entirely at this point."
3,Decent movie if you can relate,"And also one of those that you have to relate to for it to make much sense.Major spoiler so don't read further if you haven't seen the movie to form your own opinion.It's common, if not the rule, for people who are devoid of human contact to begin making their own reality, and most of that reality will come from their past, or from things they imagine could happen. What have you done wrong, what could you have done differently, what could possibly happen if left to your wildest imagination. In a situation like this, wildest imagination is really all you have.This is not a horror movie. It's a psychological thriller about being forced to confront your fears and deal with your own personal demons. If you have personal demons, then you will understand the movie. If you don't, then you're going to be wondering what happened even after the movie is finished.I loved the ending. It was as it should have been."
4,it just works,"I had originally bought the motorola hs 850 because of the boom mic but it became uncomfortable after an hour on my ear. I then bought the Tekkeon after reading the glowing reviews and I see why everyone loves it. It's light, it's simple, it does what it says it'll do and nothing more. Plus, it was half the price of the motorola! Why pay for a brand name when a product from little known Tekkeon will do the job?"
1,First day button broken,I opened this kettle and the button did not work. I called Bodum and they told me to return it. So crappy product and no customer service when there is a problem.
5,The Sign of the Chrysanthemum,"I think this was a great book. It was about a boy named Muna. Muna has never known his father because he left before Muna was born. So, after Muna's mother died, Muna went in search of his father. Muna meets many news people along the way and lives with a swordsmith. you have to read the rest of the book to find out what happens next. But, I would highly recommend it, especially to seventh graders studying fuedal Japan. I give this book two thumbs up!!!"
3,Not Paterson's best work,"Although splendidly researched as always with any of Katherine Paterson's work, I found this story sluggish at times. The characters were not very sympathetic, so it was hard to relate to their struggles."
4,"Helpful, but you might want to hire a tourguide","I visited Angkor Wat and Siem Reap in September. We hired a driver that pointed us to the right direction for 3 days, 2 nights. Although the book was helpful, if you want to know the vast history and symbology surrounding these massive temples, i recommend hiring a guide. Cambodia is very hot and humid, so trying to read the descriptions in 100 degrees weather while sweating profusely is not such a great idea. The book gives a good background and orientation of the area."
2,Disappointment,"The fragrance is mildly unpleasant. It made my hair soft and untangled. The big disappointment was that it did not give my fine, naturally blond hair a fuller texture as advertized. I've tried many and this doesn't perform any better than products costing a fraction of the price. Save your money."
4,Clearly a Revenge!,"This album has a real hardrock kinda old school KISS feel to it. This was supposed to feature Eric Carr behind the drums, but when time came to actually go into the studio and record this album Eric was to ill from his brain tumour to attend. Instead it's Eric Singer on drums. Singer is a truly remarkable drummer with a very heavy and groovy feel to his play. Revenge is clearly what the title states a revenge back after Eric Carrs tragic death. KISS shows that they've taken KISSTory to a new level back to their roots of kick ass rock n'roll. With songs like ""Unholy"" ""I Just Wanna"" ""Domino"" and ""God Gave Rock and Roll To You"" KISS proves in my opinion to be the best line-up for this period in time. Off course the album is dedicated to great Eric Carr who was not only an incredible drummer but also a very nice human being, god rest his soul."
5,"""A PEAK Experience!""","This book reinforced my belief in self and rejuvinated my sprit of ""hope"". I enjoyed it so much that when I finished reading it I immediately purchased copies for my wife, daughter, sister and niece. Every man can benefit by reading this book and every woman deserves her own copy.As President of Pinnacle Speakers Bureau, I help organizations plan events that are designed to be a PEAK Experience. I can truly say that this book is a PEAK Experience!...Benny Williford, Pinnacle Speakers Bureau"
3,Disappointed,I talked my son into getting this instead of Marble Blast Gold because it was cheaper. We ended up getting Marble Blast Gold anyway.
3,ya esta bueno!,"Suficiente. Me he leido todos los libros en la serie de caballo de troya y francamente ya esta bueno, por favor, no mas. El cuento estaba muy bueno en el primer y a lo mejor el segundo libro, pero ya. Se agoto. El estilo cansa, y se nota a leguas que la farsa del diario del mayor es eso, una farsa, y que esto no es mas que una novela, por lo que seguir pretendiendo que es una historia real es ridiculo. Como dicen en los estados unidos, el autor ha tratado de milk this cow hasta el final. Pues creo que ya llego ese final."
3,Dangerous Women,"Saw ""Dangerous Women"" short stories listed on Nelson Demille site. Was excited to see many of my favorite authors listed; Dever, M Connelly, DeMille(of course)...thought it was good chance to brief on other's style, etc.Good 'bathroom read'...if you are a guy."
1,germ collector,"if you pull the nipple all the way to the sides, out will come a collection of 'things' from hair to lint to dry milk...one day while cleaning one of the pacifiers I noticed a piece of hair stuck to the base of the nipple, when I pulled the nipple to the side, the hair still wouldn't come off, so I pulled it really hard and along with the hair came a string of lint...I did the same thing to the other 3 pacifiers and it was the same...since then I kept an eye on these nipples and noticed that even within a few hours of use, it still collected lint and other things...... I regularly would boil the pacifiers and wash around the base of the nipple, but this isn't enough for these pacifiers...I am sending these nipples back to the company for my $$ back...don't buy these unless you are willing to constantly keep washing them within a few hours throughout the day..."
2,so far so good...,"I have very slowly made my way through the first chapter, which is 70 pages long. Taking notes is a must for me since there are at least 20 people unknown to me in this description of the discovery of her death. Clearly this is not an easy read but hopefully will lead to something substantial. Hopefully chapter 2 will be easier and so on through the book."
5,Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer,"Wow! Do I enjoy using this machine... I have always used a hand mixer until this purchase and it has been a true delight. It is powerful, quick, and the color is an absolute delight. It always bring a smile just to look at it! I thoroughly enjoy it and will do so in the years ahead - a great purchase."
5,The Houding: A Feminist Take,"What a great feminist take on Holmes and Watson. They're vegan and homeopathic. They care about issues; They even care about each other. But that doesn't stop them from breaking all the rules, commandeering an animal activist van, breaking into the zoo to steal a baby chimp (whom they both fall in love with), and arriving unannounced at billionaires' homes.De Helen has done her homework. Holmes enthusiasts will not be disappointed. In fact the victim, Priscilla Vandeleur Leoni, is a descendant of the Baskervilles inheriting both their fortune and their curse. And she dies of a heart attack after being attacked by pit bulls.A feminist take, but nothing too heavy. A truly modern Watson and Holmes."
2,Too small to write!,"First of all I thought that this book was going to be bigger, but the pages are index-cards sized. Second, some questions are interesting but others are kind of boring. You can buy a notebook or srapbook and do it by yourself really! :("
4,Communicating with Grandpa,"I ordered this book for use at our Nursing Home. It has 2 purposes: 1. For staff to get ideas for starting conversations with residents, and 2. For resident's family members to have rewarding conversations with the resident and other family members."
5,Good watch,"Skagen makes good watches and that is the end of story. This particular watch is taste specific. Not everyone likes an all black watch, but it is a limited collection item after all."
5,Excellent design and performance,"I loved the watch face!: Bold, beautiful.The movement and functioning, as excellent as Skagen always is."
4,"Lovely Photos, not comprehensive","A useful guide to help identify specimens. They profile similiar species in similar poses, very helpful. It doesn't offer as many species as the RTP guides, but then RTP guides don't show photos. I also suspect that the guide I have isn't as likely to handle weathering (mud/rain/etc) as well as the RTP bindings."
3,High maintenance and doesn't keep coffee warm,"I bought this machine about 2 years ago because it has a timer and a bean grinder, and looks trendy. It works well and I've never had a big technical problem with the machine.A few weaknesses: it's high maintenance because after each use, at least six different parts of the machine need to be cleaned (ginder upper piece, grinder bottom piece, filter basket, filter basket holder, the carafe and the carafe lid). I've also noticed that the coffee does not really stay hot in the carafe for very long at all - this is actually a considerable flaw. The coffee also doesn't really taste very good when left in the carafe even for 10 mins.My next coffeemaker purchase will likely be a different one."
3,Too much work to clean!!,"This is a very attractive coffee maker and looks great on my counter, and the carafe does keep the coffee warm for several hours (even without preheating). However just as the other reviewers have said, the grinder is loud and it is a major pain to clean. I curse myself everytime I go to make a pot of coffee for making so much extra work for myself! If I forget to clean it the night before, it takes me 20 minutes to get it cleaned and set up for the days coffee. Trust me, the old fashioned way of grindng the beans separately is so much easier!"
1,Worst coffee maker I've ever owned,"We were excited to receive this coffee maker as a gift, but after one week, I'm getting rid of it. True, the clean up is a hassle, but if it brewed a decent cup of coffee, I would be willing to live with it. The coffee consistently gets stuck in the grinder and leaves you with a weak, tasteless batch of coffee. Save your money!"
2,"Love the idea, hate the clean up","The all-in-one is great for space and the idea is nice. Unfortunately, the steam from the brewing gets into the grinder area making the fine coffee dust into a sticky gooey mess that you have to clean out after each use, including the entire feed from the grinder into the basket.The pop-out door isn't well constructed either. For the price, I would choose another model without the built-in grinder."
2,Three time fail: Leaks a lot,"The reservoir on my first one started leaking about 2 yrs after I got it. I called Cuisinart and they replaced it. That one started leaking in less that a year. They replaced it, but expected me to pay shipping to send back the old one. Now the second replacement has started leaking after just under a year... I am over it and switching brands for my new coffee maker.I love the way this Cuisinart coffee maker looks, and how little space it takes up on the counter. I like the grind and brew features, it's easy to program, not that much of drag to clean, though oyou have ot work to get the coffee oils and dust out of the carafe lid; but the thermal carafe is a hassle to pour from--I end up having to completely invert it!I am VERY disappointed in the reservoir leak problem, and since I am 3 for 3 with this machine, making one 6 pot cup a day, I just can't recommend it--unless you want to give a wedding gift to a couple you don't care for."
3,Just okay,"We registered for this coffee maker as a wedding gift based on a family member's recognition. Though it makes good coffee, and is easy and convenient to set up, it is very difficult to clean. You are supposed to clean the grinder after each use, and I find that coffee grinds easily get in nooks and crannies you wouldn't think they would. If I realized how time consuming this would be to clean, I would have registered for a separate coffe maker and grinder."
1,the worst coffee maker and grinder combination ever,"The grinder gets plug every time you brew coffee. If you keep the coffee maker plug all the time the grinder starts working on its own and in order to turn it off, you have to unplug it.The steam created when brewing, get's into the circuits.I won't be buying any coffee maker from this brand in the future."
3,Not what I thought it would be,We had an older model Cuisinart Grind and Brew for years. We finally had to replace it. I thought I was ordering the style with the glass carafe but ended up with the thermal. We have not been able to get as good a cup of coffee out of this one for some reason. And we HATE the way the coffee trickles out of the carafe. Like the old style MUCH better. The thermal is not an improvement in our book!
2,A lot to clean and bad customer service,"While I like the fresh bean ground and into the coffee maker, there is a lot to clean, and the carafe leaks making a mess. I was very disappointed in the carafe as it leaks and does not keep the coffee warm. Customer service is very rude as well. They can not replace any defective parts for a while since the coffe maker is new and they don't have them (after waiting on hold for 45 min)and she made me feel dumb even for calling."
3,leaky machine,"It's a nice machine, but I couldn't figure out where all the water was coming from until I turned the machine over and realized that it was leaking. It's a problem if the seals on the water tank start to go."
2,frustrating machine,"Like others below, I was totally frustrated by trying to pour the last 1-3 cups of coffee. The lid always leaked, no matter what I tried. Also, just opening the top up was a two handed job, as was removing the plastic top where you put in the beans - everything seemed to stick and be hard to work. I called Cuisinart - they offered to take back the machine in trade on another Cuisinart product - they did not tell me there is a newly designed carafe or offer to send any replacement parts. My old $20 grinder and $20 coffeemaker are far less trouble and do just as well in the coffemaking department."
1,Worst Coffee maker I've ever had,"Yup, they are getting this one back. Everything works fine, except it brews the worst cups of coffee I've ever tasted. I cannot get anything but a bitter cup. Tried different combinations like the fineness of the grind to using a supplied coffee filter, and everything in between. Burned up 5 lbs of coffee trying different combinations. NO LUCKThe grinder is way too small for even 9 cups of coffee, unless you like yours to look like Tea. Cleanup is a pain in the A...Our former (12yr old but now dead) Krupps, brewed the best coffee. Even when we had guests over for dinner, everyone would always comment on how good the coffee was.We ended up getting out the old dusty $12.99 Mr. Coffee, coffee maker, and at least enjoyed fairly good cup of coffee.So, Purpose totally defeated. Maybe the company should stick to food processors.Thats my opinion and I'm sticking to it."
1,The Supermodel of coffeemakers,"I purchased my Grind & Brew 3.5 years ago. About six months ago I started using it daily instead of just on weekends. What a disappointment. Its basket door randomly pops open during brewing (yet when I try to spring it open between uses, it sticks) and it leaks from the bottom, issues that shouldn't be occurring in a 3-yr-old coffeemaker, let alone a premium-brand coffeemaker. I'll admit, I was attracted by its looks. But if this thing were a human being, it would be a supermodel -- all beauty, negligible substance. WhatEVER. I'm buying a new coffeemaker, this week. Avoiding the Cuisinart name. Going back to my good buddy, Braun."
2,failed,"failed; as with so many such products, the benefits are illusory; it did not appear at all effective for its purpose"
1,do not waste your money and time,"Purchased this machine thinking it would be great as are all my other Cuisinart machines. NOT!!! A mess to clean up after EVERY use, grounds back up into grinder, coffee does not stay hot, and Cuisinart offers to send you a new one, (not the one without the grinder, which is great and cheaper) and expects you to pay $10. shipping and handling both ways. Nice huh? They did tell me how to soak the parts in detergent each time I use it to keep the coffee oils from jamming the grinder in its place and to use a Q-tip to clean around the stem. PLEASE! Cuisinart is clearly aware of the problems of this machine but they keep on selling them. Does not mean you have to fall for it though. I'll not use the grinder again. Amazon should consider removing it from their list as well."
4,Almost perfect,"Read all the reviews of such and picked this one.PROS: Carafe keeps coffee hot, coffee tastes great, easy to operate, love the stainless steel look of this grind and brew, grinding not too loudCONS: No tube to tell you amount of water you are pouring in BUT there are numbers inside you look in and see, carafe drips if you don't pour very carefully"
4,I like it,My husband asked for this specific coffee maker for Christmas. He had seen it at a friend's house and thought it worked great. He was right. This is our first experience with a coffee grinder so the noise was a bit of a surprise but I now know that all grinders whine loudly. The auto timer is nice so we can get up to freshly ground hot coffee. I like the thermal carafe (no heated plate). It keeps the coffee hot for hours. I do wash all the parts every time I set it up but I don't see that as a problem. Buy and enjoy!
1,Worthless,"After 6 months of use it broke. Cuisinart support was zero help. All they can do is send out a replacement part. If the broken piece is not one of their 6 parts, too bad. I'm going back to Mr. Coffee. My last coffee pot lasted 12 years."
3,attractive on the outside..,"I've had this machine for a few months now and I still cant get used to it. The lid for the carafe is absolutely impossible. The coffee doesn't stay hot and it drips onto the bottom plate even if you don't remove the carafe for the ""pause and pour"" feature. Heaven forbid you should forget to put the little cover over the filter basket-OMG! The grinder constantly has condensation, I don't even like using it. Buy something simpler with a warmer and buy your grinder separate. It is pretty though, and the buttons are easy to use. lol Chief complaint is the coffee doesn't stay hot, and trying to get the lid on the carafe just right is frustrating. Could be something wrong with the lid that I have??"
5,Phenominal Coffee Maker,"When I first was purchasing this coffee maker I was very torn between a model like this, and one of the Keurig Single Cup makers.Following a couple months of Intense use of the maker I'm incredibly impressed by the product and could not be happier. The coffee comes out incredibly tasteful from the grinder everytime and the the coffee stays warm for hours in the stainless steel pot.Very pleased."
1,Caught on fire,"Our smoke detector went off at 1:30 am. We went to see why and our COFFEEMAKER was ON FIRE. I cannot believe that this could happen. The back of the coffeemaker is melted and our countertops are ruined I believe it was an electrical fire. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! IF YOU HAVE ONE, do NOT KEEP IT PLUGGED IN OVERNIGHT!!!"
2,"If you like ""real"" coffee try Malitta.","If you like ""real"" coffee and not ""tea"" then pass this up.I fill the container with as much beans as possible and the coffee always comes out very WEAK. I have to add instant coffee to make it stronger. I have tried everything to remedy this problem to no avail.I cannot wait until this machine breaks so I can justify buying the Malitta grinder coffee maker again, which makes a much better cup of coffee. I had one years ago and used the heck out of it.Also, the Cuisinart states that it ""easy"" to clean.....Wrong! It is a pain.On the plus side; My husband likes this machine as he enjoys ""tea""."
1,Frustrating MESS,"My sister passed on this coffee maker as she never used it. My husband loves the grind capability, but I HATE the mess. 2 out of 3 times it overflows all over my counter, down the sides, onto the floor... inevitably when we are entertaining. I have tried scrupulously measuring the grounds, but it still overflows. The pot is undrinkable because it is full of grounds. It works fine if you are making less than 8 cups, I suppose, but I need to be able to serve coffee to guests without embarrassing clean-ups/grounds/delays. I HATE this machine."
2,Messy! Messy!,"I've never had to clean a coffee maker so much. My previous grinder/brew machine was from Melitta, which never required this much cleaning. The Cuisinart leaves a mud puddle in the grinder area after every use, creating sludge that is hard to clean off. The mud puddles under the grinder basket, up inside of it and it is difficult to clean and dry this area. The water chamber is awkward and there are just too many parts. Yes, once cleaned it works nicely, but it is a royal pain in the behind. I think I might just go back to a Melitta."
2,"Convenience in the AM, pain in the @*& the night before!","This machine makes a great cup of coffee - if you are willing to work hard to maintain the grinder, which crusts over with coffee dust after every use.It gets to the point now where we won't make coffee, because of the clean-up afterwards.And one more thing - the grinder sounds like a jet taking off. We cover the machine with a towel every night, so that it won't wake the kids."
1,Don't Turn Your Back on this Piece of Junk!,"This product has a critical design flaw that causes the main drip filter holder tray to pop open while the unit is operating. If you are not watching the machine like a hawk, the result is hot water and mucky coffee grounds spilled all over the counter. What a mess!The problem is plastic hooks that wear out prematurely. The overall unit contains way too much plastic, and seems to have been designed by a team of artist ""Industrial Designers"" without a Mechnanical Engineer involved.My advice, avoid ALL products from Cusinart. If you need an appliance these days, buying anything with an American/Chinese component is asking for trouble. My next coffee maker will either be German or Korean, at least companies from those countries still seem to have a ""real"" engineer involved in the design before shipping production to China."
2,"Works for me, could be better","I gave it a four stars almost a year and half ago. Today had to change it to 2 star as it simply stopped working. This is the first coffee maker I had so I don't know how long a coffee maker is supposed to last. Still 3 years used only lightly - mostly at weekends, I'd expect any kitchen utility shall survive longer than this.--Below my original review---------I've had it for two years. It's my first grind and brew so I had no comparison. However as a consumer I felt there should be better ones. I bought it because of its name Cuisinart. It looks very elegant in the kitchen. The biggest drawback is it is really hard to clean if you Grind coffee. Thermo Coffee pot does not really keep coffee hot/Warm. When coffee is ready, you better drink right away. But overall it does work. It makes coffee. It can grind. I set the timer before going to bed and when I wake up coffee is waiting for me. It is noisy when it grinds, but grinding supposed to be noisy, doesn't it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This item has to be one of the worse products that I have ever owned. It makes an o.k. cup of coffee, it is a nightmare to clean, & after only 9 months the grinder no longer works. I do not have one positive thing to say about this product. Nice concept, poorly designed."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I was so excited to get a combo machine! No longer would I have to grind my beans and then put them in the coffee maker. I would also have a thermos so my coffee would stay warmer longer. But, this machine was not as good as I imagined. Yes, the beans do grind. But, if you're making a six cup pot of coffee it continues to grind for a 10 cup pot. The coffee did taste good. But, clean up was a lot more than I imagined. I thought I could every once in awhile clean out the grinder like I do my stand alone. But, after brewing a cup of coffee the steam gets in the grinder so you have to clean it up to avoid it ruining the grinder. Too much of a hassle so it went back!"
1,Worst of the best,This product makes great coffee. But if ease of use is your priority this is a zero. It is loud. If you program the timer for morning coffee you wont need an alarm. It grinds for an eternity. To add insult to injury there are six separate parts you need to wash each time you use the pot. Dont make my mistake. Buy a separate grinder and coffee maker. This one is a looser.
5,Great Cup of Coffee!,"Our son mentioned at Thanksgiving that our coffee is ""lousy"" and that we should get the Cuisinart Grind and Brew like his. Our daughter gave us one for Christmas, with the thermal pot, and we love it! Granted, it sounds like a jet taking off for a minute when it grinds, but the coffee is SO GOOD and it stays hot for a long time. Is cleaning the few parts in the pot really that hard? I'd rather clean them than pay whatever a cup of coffee costs at Starbucks. I definitely recommend this product."
4,This coffee maker work great!,"The only gripe would be moisture getting into the grinder, but this is easily fixed by leaving the top open after brewing for it to dry out."
4,Better than expected in ease of use and great coffee,"I am not going into all the details that other people have already covered; but I'm taking the time to write a review because no matter what other people say, this is a great coffee maker. Anyone who has used a separate grinder and coffee maker knows about the mess. This coffee maker makes it easy and neat. No transferring the grounds from a grinder to coffee maker. No cleaning up the spilled grounds.When you are done with the grind and brew, it's a snap to clean. Easy to take apart and put together. It is also very easy to program. The last few days I have woken up to fresh hot freshly ground coffee. Nice way to start the day.I would say that measuring the water is a pain because the inside of the carafe should have cup markings. Other than that, best machine and great looking too. I have the stainless model."
1,must have been paid,"I wonder if after all the bad (true) reviews the company employees were sent to ""re-review"" the grind and brew. 5 stars? I think not. The grinder is noisy, it clogs with moist grounds is hard to pry apart. (try grabbing it by the finger slots and pulling it open) there are unground beans and wet grounds left in the grinder that didn't make it into the basket.The company wants us to return it to the store. The company spokesperson said the only thing they would do is send me a new one of the same model. No thank you."
1,Worked once and then dies.,I replaced a grind and brew that was a few years old because the front kept popping open.The new one worked once and then died.
2,High Maintenance,Very disappointed with the amount of cleaning required. And it's a messy job. Condensation builds in the grinder with each use causing excessive accumulation of ground coffee that sticks to the inside of the grinding chamber and other places. Even whole beans will stick to the side of the chamber. You have to take the grinder out and wash it. Water alone will not do it though. You have to wipe the remaining residue away with a paper towel. Say good bye to clean finger nails. Have owned a few self grinders. None of them came close in maintenance. The basket chamber also has a cheap plastic construction. Recommend against.
2,"Leaks, clogs, high maintenance, but looks nice","Ostensibly the perfect coffee maker for our kitchen; brushed stainless look, grind and brew, thermal caraf. Oh boy, what a nightmare. We've had it for 5 years now, it has always clogged up, it is very difficult to clean. The grinder mechanism practically welded itself to the plastic chassis, making it impossible to remove for cleaning. Rougly 20% of the time it mysteriously leaves 80% of the coffee on the counter during the brew process. We're still baffled by how it happens, but it leaks profusely during the brew process. This normally happens on Monday mornings ;-)."
4,Good little coffee maker,"This is a great coffee maker. Easy to operate, Easy to clean. This is my 3rd one to own. Easy to program for regular gound coffee or fresh grine.Coffee will stay warm for hours with the insulated carafe. Plastic lid is a bit fragile."
1,Where do I start?,"1. Opening the reservoir takes two thumbs and considerable force.2. A step-like water level indicator is down inside the reservoir and very difficult to read.3. The grinder fills with condensation and makes a gummy mess with the residue grinds.4. The grinder has several pieces and is tedious to clean and dry. You have to do so every time you use it. I finally stopped using it and went back to a separate grinder.5. The grinder sounds like a jet engine and seems to go on forever.6. The carafe drips all over when you pour.7. The coffee needs reheating after about a half hour. (I drink it black.)Other than that, it's great. Looks good, too."
4,Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew,"This is our 2nd Cuisinart Grind and Brew. The first one lasted approximately 5 years. Yes its appearance resembles The Jetson's robot maid and it does make a noise for a few seconds when it grinds the beans. For positives, however, the noise works well as an alarm clock and the difference between fresh ground coffee and pre-ground is significant. I would like to see it manufactured so that it could be easily disassembled for a potential fix.....but for now considering the price and its quality, I think it's a good buy!!"
1,I've had two -- They are awful,"I've had two of these things and they both leaked like crazy. The first one just stopped working after a year and a couple months. My wife bought another one in a rush for a party, and it started leaking within a month of buying it.Definitely choose another coffee maker."
1,Horrible,"The product was listed in Good condition; however, it came covered in coffee grounds, had broken filter, charcoal bag burst open and did not brew a hot cup of coffee. I was to afraid to send the product back and just took it as a loss, will not buy used items on-line again."
2,Used Cuisinart coffemaker,"I was very unhappy with the item because of the missing parts that I had to order and being used I understand that it would look that way, but this one was filthy. I had to dismantle it and clean all parts. I didn't get the manual with it so I had to contact the Cuisinart Company to get one. The coffeemaker couldn't be used until the parts that I ordered arrived.I'm very happy with it now. It's a great coffemaker.Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew. This has been discontinued item from the Company.I'm usually very happy with the items I buy from Amazon, minus the one."
1,BEST KITCHEN DECORATION,"For Kitchen Art, the DGB-600BC gets an A+.But is down hill from there. When unwrapped there were scraps of metal and plastic from the manufacturing process and this was after runnung water 3 times thru the Brewing process.The Carafe must be warmed before brewing.The 6 cups calibrated in the Water Tank is actually a bit over 4, 8 oz. cups.If a paper filter is not used with the ""gold"" filter, the water passes the grounds too fast and the result is brown water.The door to the Brew Chamber came open and spilled my coffee to the counter top. This requires a person to watch the entire brewing process.Water passes thru the grounds too fast. A common brown paper filter from Wal-Mart was not porous enough and the Brew Chamber over flowed - making another mess.I strongly suspect Cuisinart did not have a Quality Control Inspector in the Factory that made this Coffee Maker."
2,Cuisinart grind and brew is disappointing,"We are disappointed in the Cuisinart DGB-6000BC Grind and Brew coffee we recently purchased. We bought two (one of us drinks decaf...). The carafe is POORLY INSULATED and coffee quickly cools off - having that carafe was one of the main reasons we bought this model. The carafe itself is not very ergonomic (you need to practically turn it upside down to let the coffee out). Also the gold basket filters coffee poorly so that grinds are in the coffee...the problem, I believe, is that the grinding process grinds too finely. There is no point having the gold basket (which came with the one we bought) if it is better to use filters - which we now do. We suggest to Cuisinart (if they are reading this review) to change the grinding time. In summary, we like the idea of the grind and brew idea but it needs to be re-engineered so the the carafe is better insulated and the grinds are not so fine (or a different gold basket filter design..)"
1,Way too much work for a pot of coffee,"There are way too many parts that you must clean after each pot of coffee. Forget about it if you need to make two pots for a large group, it would take forever! I recommend buying a model that has a separate grinder."
2,Coffee Lover,"I would grind my coffee fresh as often as I could. So for Christmas my husband thought it would be a great idea to get me a grinder and coffee maker in one. I thought what a treat. This hasn't been what I expected. The carafe leaks at the top, and if you use already ground coffee you have to clean everything including the grinder. It's very time consuming. The carafe didn't keep the coffee as warm as I had hoped. I called cusinart several times and finally got through after waiting 45 min. They said they were aware of the carafe leaking. They don't have any parts for this piece yet so I needed to call back in a month or so.We paid a [alot of money] for a coffee pot that leaks."
2,An expensive disappointment,"I bought one after Buying a Hamilton Beach Brew Station to replace the old Mr. Coffee and sepaerate coffee grinder and thermal carafe - basically to save counterspace.The grinder in this machine is much to small to hold enough beans to make a good pot of coffee. And the steam from the brewing coffee makes the remaining grinds (yes all the ground beans don't even get to the filter for brewing)stick to the grinder making a messy cleanup.The caraffe is designed poorly and difficult to pour - can't pour out the last half cup unless you want to spill it all over the place. Like the brew station - cofee only stays hot about 2 hours DESPITE the thermal caraffe.More disappointing than the brewstation because it costs so much more. Am going back to my old set up - coffee better, easier to make with Mr. Coffee and stays hot all day in the thermos carafe."
1,Wonderful until it fails (and it does fail),"Now on my third one of these. Always the same failure modes: Brews half a pot then turns off. And it leaks. First one failed in a few months. Returned it and got another one. Repeat... Repeat. Done. It's probably also worth mentioning that Cuisinart's ""fill-in-the-blanks"" online tech support requests are never answered. Get a Capresso instead. Worth the extra $$$."
1,messy,This coffee maker is difficult to clean. Mold has a way of finding the cracks around the grinder. My filter area often pops open while brewing. The maker continues to drip and makes an awful mess all over my counter. Not happy with this one...
1,If you like your coffee lukewarm...,....buy this coffee maker. I have to throw my coffee in the microwave halfway through the first cup.
2,Cuisinart can't make it stop leaking.,"I love the idea of freshly grinding your beans for the best possible taste. And this coffee maker does a good job in all but one respect. The water that goes through the grinder to flush the ground beans into the filter invariably leaks down around the shaft of the grinder into the housing sometimes to the extent that it also runs down behind the carafe. It is a pain to clean the unit up every time. I contacted Cuisinart on the web and was surprised by a telephone call from a representative. I explained the problem and asked if it was common. The answer was no, but when I asked for a new grinder it turned out they were on backorder. Hmmm. No problems, but all grinders used up.Anyway, in a few weeks a new grinder appeared in the mail. Unfortunately, it looks just like the old one and leaks just like the old one. So, if you don't mind a nasty cleanup every time you make coffee or if you can just live with coffee in the housing, this unit makes good coffee."
1,Save your money,"The grinder is outrageously loud (like and air-raid siren!). So, don't even think about using this in the morning, which is, unfortunately, when most people want to use a coffee maker. Even if you don't use the grind feature you still have to clean 7 pieces every time you make coffee! What a pain! And if you forget (or don't have time) to clean it, when you realize it at bedtime, setting it up for the morning, you have to clean AND dry all seven pieces before you can even start to set it up. I returned mine and got a Capresso MT500 (Consumer Reports recommended) It costs less, has the thermal carafe and makes excellent coffee with almost no clean-up."
2,Too many cons,"This is a good looking machine with too many cons, however:1) 4-5 parts need to be cleaned after each use, no exception2) it uses way too much coffee (compared to my old Krups). The reaons: grinds too coarse and uses a basket type filter. Most new coffee makers use cone type filter that extract more flavor from the coffee.3)Grinder whines and works for about half a minute, regardlsee how much coffee it grinds. There is no control to shorten the grinding cycle.4) The carafe is nice , but very hard to pour from. You almost have to hold it up side down to get the last cup.There are few pros, however:1) Keeps coffee fresh and warm for hours2) Easy controlsIt is expensive but not idiot proof. If you forget to put the carafe in place, it will overflow."
1,"Great coffee, but carafe leaks","I loved Cuisineart's thermal coffemaker so much that I bought two more carafes. After two uses, they each leaked -- the gasket between the plastic handle/collar and metal pot failed. CUISINART REFUSED TO STAND BEHIND THEM, REFUSED REPLACEMENT, REFUSED REFUND! Two months later, the carafe that originally came with the coffemaker failed the same way. I have some very expensive useless junk!"
2,Nice design. Terrible coffee. :-(,"Sleek, compact design with the built-in grinder and flat-bottomed coffee basket. Carafe is easy to use and unlike some thermal carafes works well keeping the coffee hot. My only design complaint is there's no external fill indicator, making one look inside the water resevoir to try and figure out how much water is there for partial-pots. Not very user-friendly... And when will someone in the coffeemaker design industry figure out that adding little glides or rollers on the botton of the unit would be a blessing for moving it in and out from underneath the overhead cabinets?!!HOWEVER, the point of a coffeemaker is coffee...and the coffee tastes terrible, very bitter and rather weak. I'm returning mine."
1,very disappointed,"I have never spent this much on a coffee maker and I regret that I did not listen to the warnings in other reviews. During the first 3 weeks, the machine overflowed and leaked 3-4 times...including during a dinner party. The cleaning of multiple parts is an inconvenience and makes me think twice about making a pot....but this would be bearable if not for the unpredictability of the leaking. The pot needs to be set up PERFECTLY or you will have a mess. I like strong coffee but you cannot put too many scoops of beans in the grinder or it will overflow. This is a pain when making a full pot.I have a 12 cup Cuisinart and loved it but wanted a grinding machine so bought this one....big mistake. The coffee is decent when I make a partial pot, but I cant make it strong enough for a full pot or it will overflow. I am switching to the one cup Keurig system."
2,Cusinart self-grinding coffeemaker,"I've had one for some months. While I love its functionality except that there's a HUGE downside---DAILY cleanout of the chute from the grinder. The instructions say """"""periodic"""""""" but that's false. I was told by Cuisinart that I needed to use less oily (light roast) Arabica beans. That made NO difference.So, if you don't mind daily disassembly of the coffeemaker do buy it."
4,Book is in very good condition considering its age,"F. Van Wyke Mason is a brilliant writer. I first read OUR VALIANT FEW, after reading that book, I was hooked on his work. This book is just one of many by this prolific author who started his writing career in 1931. During the war he served as historian for General Eisenhower.The books that I have read have all been historical novels. Their time line started with the revolutionary war for independence and advanced through the war between the states. I look forward to reading the latest addition to my library.You can read more about this author and will find a list of his works at: [...]"
4,An FYI re: author's name (it's not Rizzoli),"N.B. The author's name is Steven Stellingwerf. Rizzoli is the publisher.I was thinking I didn't have this book and cross-referenced the ISBN on another site (comparing prices ;p) and immediately recognized the author and thus avoided a duplicate purchase.I rate this book four stars, knowing the measurements are incorrect, for the inspiring projects and depictive photos. I like his finely detailed work and think overall, this a must-have edition to your gingerbread-baking collection."
5,Great!!!,"Purchased after a Food Network special on ""How they make it"" aired on Pizzelle's. I had forgotten that I ate these as a kid. I purchased and made about 250 pizzelles over the holidays! Performed great!!!Defiently worth the price, which is really cheap!"
4,small pizzelles,"The cuisinart pizzelle press works well, but I was expecting the cookies to be larger. My family was disappointed in the size of the cookies."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","I purchased the Cuisinart Pizzelle Press today and have been very upset with it. Think if your worst waffle making experience (batter leaking out, burning yourself, waffles sticking, etc) now multiply that by 1000. You need to use crisco or Pam spray each time you pour batter on the maker but they still stick. It is an absolute mess. I am talking nightmare! Just as I was beginning to get the hang of it the lock down latch broke off. I had to laugh or I was going to cry. This piece of garbage is packed up and being brought back to Bed Bath and Beyond right now. It is just not worth the hassle! Buy some yummy pizzelle at your local market and be done with it!"
1,10 month life,Bought this in December 09 and have used it four times with good results. Stopped working mid-batch today 10 months later. Really dissappointed in the quality of the appliance!! Would definately not recommend.
5,Perfect Every Time!,"We love this little machine and so do our guests. These make the best Pizzelles in little time and no mess. If you don't want alot of sugar for dessert, you make these in vanilla or chocolate and sprinkle powdered sugar or fresh fruit. Many desserts have so much sugar in their mixes but you make your batter, cook these up in no time at all and your craving for sweets is quite satisfied. I put ours on a cooling rake and then stack them up between wax paper in a tin when they are cool. They stay crisp and if you break a few, save the ""crunchies"" and layer some pudding and crunchies for a parfait."
2,Latch breaks off after moderate use,"This unit worked pretty well until the locking latch broke off and it can't be repaired. Now we must hold it closed with our fingers while hot steam comes out. It was only used once a year at Christmas, so it probably had a total of 6 cookie making sessions before it broke."
5,very pleased,"This pizelle maker was bought for a gift. I have one, and bought this for my grand daughter as she likes pixelle's. We love ours, and make several batches each week. I know our kids and grand kids reach for the canister on the coffee table as soon as they come in. It's very simple to use, and I think it is a quality product."
5,We have had fun using the Press,"Thaks for making it available and sending it on time. How many more words, ah yes, four more are needed."
4,Good pizzelles,"It's a little on the small side. The clasp is fragile and sticks. Easily breakable clasp. Makes good pizzelles, though."
1,Not happy,"I am disappointed in this. It sticks every time, even with non stick spray. I'm not happy at all."
5,Super easy hot off the griddle pizzelles!,"I love this little machine! The recipes are easy and pizzelles are delicious. This pizzelle maker heats up in a hurry and lets me make a dozen of these sweet, addictive treats in no time at all. I compared every brand available on Amazon and am delighted I chose this one. It's compact size makes it simple to store in my little kitchen. Now I can make pizzelles in a hurry any time!"
5,Great Pizzelle Maker!,"I received this as a gift. After it came in the mail, I came here to read the reviews and immediately became concerned after reading some of the reviews. However, after using it, I have no concerns. My pizzelles were perfect, I didn't find the latch flimsy, and the size of the cookies are the same size my huband's gramma has been making for 70 years. I love the light that comes on when they are done.....no more standing around counting to 30 with every batch. I also love that there are different levels to custom make your pizzelles as light or dark as you want. I had no sticking and the pizzelles were light and crispy. A great machine."
4,great movies......,"Like all box sets, i buy them to early and then find out they are coming out with more movies that should be in the set."
4,Generac 1950 psi Pressure Washer,"Nice unit, light weight, easy to carry. I've had electric for some time and the cord has become a problem so decided to try this. Very good. It doesn't have wheels, but the light weight makes up for that for short hauls. Two wands give good choices of washing options. Overall a slick unit.Only regret was seeing the same unit new in about 3 weeks after purchase for $90 less. I'm seeing more and more of this with my Amazon purchases. I used to depend on the prices remaining competitive for considerable time, but it's seeming that Amazon's price tends to be higher that other reputable places, even after shipping is taken into account."
2,Part of the problem,"A major reason Italian-Americans so often are portrayed negatively is they've not been validated by their intellectual class. Instead, I-A intellectuals sell out to mainstream America for career advancements. This gives credence to stereotypes. De Marco Torgovnick, as she presents herself in this well written but unfortunate book, is a classic example. She benefited enormously from her culture but only begrudgingly gives it any positive strokes. What a disappointment."
4,Women watch,"Hello!This watch is wonderful,but with a problem:the band was bad in 1 side,but I fixed its.Thanks."
2,Bee pollen,"We ordered this product to see if it would help my husbands health issues naturally and he did not seem to get any benefit from it. There were no side effects from it, just no benefits either, so we will not be ordering it again in the future, unless his doctor recommends a different type of product."
4,Review,"If you a Phil Collins fan, you will definitely like this DVD. I like the atmosphere. The only downside is that it does not have lyrics (I would have rated 5 stars, it it had)."
5,Who Put My Life On Fast-Forward?,"An excellent read! It's relevant, thought-provoking, humorousand a must-read for everyone who feels stressed out.The chapters are at a comfortable length, which enable the busyreader to enjoy the book without feeling guilty about spendingtoo much time reading.It's not a book to borrow, but to buy, as its relevance is unquestionable and will stand the test of time.Warning: Do not read this book late into the night - youroutburst of laughter may not be appreciated by sleepingmembers in your household!"
1,average product,This older version of Blackberry 7100t I find has much less capacity in battery from newer versions. Wich usage of 60 min of calling time a day the battery goes dead. For some reason the clock also changes time zone with no apparent reason. I will not recomend this product.
4,The start of his solo career.,"This classic album was Tito's solo debut--producer Joe Cain gave him some very strong material and Tito's inspired and powerful vocals make the standout numbers ""Rico Melao"", ""Los Colaos"", ""La Puerta"" and especially ""Festival De Soneros"" unforgettable. For his subsequent releases, Tito would work very closely with the late Louie Ramirez (their musical partnership would result in some of Tito's best works). ""Maldades"" marked the start of Tito Allen's solo career and (along with his 1976 and 1979 releases ""Feliz Y Dichoso"" and ""Untouchable"") is indispensable for all his fans."
2,A horrid little machine,"I trusted that Cuisinart was a reliable brand with better-than-average products. Oh how wrong I was!!!! I was excited to have that timer feature, so I could smell the coffee brewing while I was getting ready in the mornings . . . And imagine my disappointment -- no, horror! -- to discover that the spring-loaded basket that holds the ground beans has now decided to POP OUT while brewing! Meaning, that I now get to hear the coffee spilling onto the element and sizzling there (and I mean the whole darn amount), while dripping off the counter and into the floor. Lemme tell ya, I am SO not in the mood to clean up such a mess first thing in the morning, and then have to start ALL OVER just to get a cup of coffee. I'm tossing mine and going for a Bunn."
2,Not a Good Design,"This coffemaker has several nice features and looks nice on the counter but the inherent design is lacking. Rather than grinding and brewing in the same basket (like the the Melitta) the Cuisinart grinds the coffee and throws it into a separate basket. This results in some coffee remaining in the grinder and being wasted. It also makes it impossible to adjust the grind level so a lot of the beans fail to be ground fine enough. No matter how many beans I use, it is impossible to make a strong cup of coffee. Plus, each time you use the coffeemaker, there are at least five items to wash. Get a Melitta instead. It's cheaper, easier to clean and makes a superior cup of coffee."
5,Great Coffee,"If you like fresh ground coffee without the hassle of grinding and then transfering the coffee, just put the water, beans, and pot in the thing and have coffee when you want, either now or program the time.We use the filter that comes with it (first time to do this) and it works great.We like strong coffee, so we use french roast, and it is good."
4,I like it,"I saw some pretty bad reviews for this product after I bought it but I like it. Yes, you need to clean the grinder, the filter container and the pot but you would need to clean that on any grinding coffee pot anyway. Yes, the grinder is loud, but aren't all grinders. There isn't a way to control the consistancy of the grounds but they have always been very fine and produced good coffee.If anything its a bit too fine. I want to buy a permanent filter for it but I am worried the grounds may go through it. Has anyone come across this problem?"
1,Worst Coffee Maker,I was given this coffee maker as a gift land thought it was great until I had to clean it. But the worst part of the product is it won't last much more than a couple years. First one refused to work after 2 years. Being STUPID I bought a second one because I like fresh ground coffee. This one was a different design than the first but they haven't improved the cleaning process or the technology because here it is two years later and it quit grinding again and I am looking for another coffee pot and I guarantee it will not be another Cuisinart!!!!!
3,Not that hard to clean,"I've owned this model for the past 2 years and really have not found cleaning to be an issue. Everyday I just dump the filter basket and give it a quick rinse along with the actual coffee pot, then weekly all of the other parts (grinder, basket, fliter, coffee pot, chute, etc) all go into the dishwasher on the top rack. So far no problems! The only monor complaint is the occasional ""sludge"" that drips down the back behind the pot, but that wipes up easily with a damp sponge.Makes some great coffee!"
1,What a disappointment!,"We were really excited when we discovered this coffee maker and couldn't wait to try the first cup of freshly brewed coffee. What a disappointment! After following all the directions and anxiously waiting for our first sip we were disappointed to find that the coffee tasted like hot, brown water. No flavor at all. We then tried to double the amount of beans with the result of a weak flavored coffee. We even bought the strongest beans, still no luck. The basket wasn't big enough to put in the amount of beans required for 8 cups of decent coffee. After calling Cuisinart and getting no help we decided to return the coffee maker. It was really too bad as we really wanted the maker to work. We liked everything about it, except that it couldn't make coffee!"
1,worst coffee machine I've ever purchased,This coffee machine brews the weakest coffee I've ever had- doesn't grindthe beans well and to clean it makes you wan't to store it in the garbagecan. That's what I did I'm going back to the melitta machine today
1,Should have learned the first time!!!,"Okay, we have had 3 of these coffee makers because we love the grind and brew feature. The first one lasted about a year and a half, and the others well, we are a little under 6 months. I have to replace this one AGAIN because the flip top lid where you fill the water chamber and put the coffee beans in completely broke off, and I now have to hold the lid down until the pot is brewed. The last 2 we had, after a few months (and several deep cleanings I might add) would take almost and hour to brew a pot. My parents also used to have one, and theirs completely overflowed and spilled all over their counter and onto their hardwood floors!!!! I am buying the Capresso Luxe which is more expensive, but if it lasts longer, and it is easier to clean, then it is worth it. Please don't waste you money because this product WILL NOT last more than a year!"
2,A Usable [Item],"At least you can drink the coffee that comes out of the thing, unlike the Mr. Coffee, which produces coffee loaded with stinking plasticizer from the cheap plastic. However, this isn't a 12-cup machine at all; it's about a 6-cup machine, using the 6:1 volume ratio of water to ground coffee recommended by Starbuck's and Joy of Cooking. Cuisinart tells you to use half that, as if you were using cheap trash coffee, and it tastes terrible. Also, plan on spending a LOT of time cleaning the grinding chamber. I'm a pretty disgruntled customer. For my main application, I'm going to be reduced to running two batches, ground outside the machine. By the way, when it fires up the grinder on the timer, it's reminiscent of an air raid siren. It's a blade grinder, not a burr grinder. [Later] OK, I use it for all my coffee making. I grind outside the machine so I won't have to clean the grinding chamber. I'm happy enough. You never know when I'll want the timer-grinder feature."
2,Coffee maker,I have this coffee maker. It makes mediocre coffee at best and doesn't keep it hot. I would not purchase it again.
2,Too many parts to clean,"I agree with the person who hoped that the new model would have a ""steam backflow prevention mechanism"" in it. Every time we use it we have to completely clean and dry the compartment where the coffee beans are placed, or it becomes like mud in there. This doesn't seem like such a big deal until you realize you've just spent 10 minutes cleaning the whole entire machine in order to set up coffee to be made in the morning, then going to bed smelling like old coffee grounds...We're taking this machine back and getting the Capresso CoffeeTeam w/ Burr Grinder, as the reviewers say you don't have to clean the grinder.We have the version with the stainless steel thermal carafe, which looks great and doesn't burn the coffee, but you also don't walk into the room and get that fresh-made coffee smell that makes getting up at 6:30am worth it. I don't know if this is because of the air-tight carafe or because, once again, lack of a steam outlet.On the plus side, the coffee tastes good."
2,I paid too much for this--,"I think the idea is novel, but the cleanup is ridiculous! It sends the water right through the coffee grinder making a huge mess. Also, in white, it gets filthy on the outside as well. I bought this for my husband as a father's day present, and this year I bought him a machine we'll actually enjoy."
3,go kitchenaid,"Ok, this coffee pot is ok, but cusinart customer service sucks! I had to order a replacment pot and they sent me the wrong thing! To this day I still have not recieved the correct item. Save yourself the agony, go kITCHENAID!"
2,disappointing,"we had this less than a year and it now doesn't heat up at all. The design made it so that all bread, no matter how thing was a little challenging to close the lid."
5,Great for making melted Cheez Whiz and peanut butter sandwiches,"When we were kids, we loved making melted cheez whiz and melted peanut butter sandwiches in this type of sandwich grill."
2,Great for Quesadillas But not Much Else,"I bought this appliance a couple of years ago. I used it only rarely, then discovered I could make quesadillas with it (as long as the tortilla is folded in half) and began using it regularly. Food tends to stick -- despite the ""non-stick"" surface -- and so of course, the thing is incredibly difficult to clean. I could deal with the cleaning task. But, all of a sudden, large flakes of teflon began coming off. I reported this to Cuisinart, asking if I could purchase replacement plates. The answer was no. They also didn't offer to replace the unit. So, I threw it away. I generally like Cuisinart products. I will not again purchase a product that has a non-stick surface"
5,Awesome!,Makes awesome sandwiches in a matter of minutes! I recommend this to everyone who has a bus to catch in the morning.
3,Just OK,"It works; however, it does not have an on/off option. You need to plug/unplug it every time you want to use it."
3,Does the job,Good price but not very easy to clean. Design Could definitely be improved with less of the silver coloured plastic on the outside
4,Good purchase,I bought this couple of weeks ago and have been using it 2-3 times a week. Works great and it's simple to make sandwiches using this. I feel this is a good buy and would recommend for others .
3,Understanding Underdogs,"Underdogs is a story about a farmer named Demetrio Macias in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. The story follows Macias from the beginning of his involvement in the revolution until a very confusing end in which Macias is still fighting. This is not a book to read if you don't know much about the Mexican Revolution. Dialogue between the characters sort of gives you what is going on in the revolution but not enough to understand. What you really get is the manner of life Macias and his men live while fighting in the revolution. Early on, Macias and his men set off to fight against the government (who are the Spaniards) that are destroying their villages and towns. Eventually Macias and his men lose vision of who exactly they are fighting and they become the men who are destroying the villages and towns. The book ends with Macias still fighting for an unknown cause."
3,A Good Message,"When I first started reading this book I thought it was really boring, but when I was finished I was glad I read it. I don't know that I like Azuela's writing style, but the message he was trying to convey was wonderful. His message was: power corrupts. This book is centered around a poor Mexican peasant named Demetrio, and his group of men rebelling against the Mexican government. At the beginning of the book the men all want a less oppressive government. Their goals are good, and their ideals are good. But as they gain more power and prestige they become more corrupt. They do cruel things to innocent people, they steal, and they are cruel to each other. Azuela makes the point over and over again that the men are poor and ignorant, they know nothing of politics, and they don't understand why they are fighting. Although I thought this book was boring, it has a very good message. It's worth reading just to understand that message."
5,Powerful tools for any professional,I'm constantly reading books on small business trends and how to maximize productivity. A friend recommended I read Brian Tracy's book and I was impressed. This book is packed full of powerful techniques to grow your business and yourself. I recommend this book to anyone looking to take their work ethic or business to the next level.

3,Two Terrible Movies/One Low Price,"Really,These movies are both horrible. ""Empire of the Ants"" has fake-looking giant ants attacking completely unsympathetic cardboard ""characters."" For those who enjoy pointless film trivia, a pre-Dynasty Joan Collins plays a trashy real-estate agent out to make a buck on unsuspecting deadbeats. Who cares? ""Tentacles"" has a fake-looking octopus attacking completely unsympathetic cardboard ""characters."" Again, who cares?This movies are only good as ""party/event movies"", ie. Call a friend over, dim the lights, fire up the popcorn, and check out this shlock!"
2,"A ""JAWS"" rip-off from the director of an ""EXORCIST"" rip-off.","A miserable sea pest that leaves its victims as skeletons washed up on the shore turns out to be none other than a giant octopus. This unintentionally funny suspense melodrama was meant to cash in on the success of JAWS, but it didn't quite duplicate the success of that film, despite the presence of four gifted Hollywood veterans: John Huston, Henry Fonda, Shelley Winters, and Bo Hopkins. Surprisingly, the quartet manages to maintain their dignity. With all of its deficiencies, TENTACLES is still not a total waste, and does, in fact, manage to produce a certain amount of entertainment, even if it is the wrong kind. A camp lovers delight. At any rate, it's better than director Hellman's notorious EXORCIST/ROSEMARY'S BABY rip-off, BEYOND THE DOOR."
1,Resistance Bands Exercise DVD,"Worst workout video I have ever bought. How could she even think that she is a trainer.the instruction was terrible, Her constant stupid smile. I suggest that she quit while she is ahead. If this were my first video to work out with,I would never buy another one."
1,Terrible. Low quality. Do not believe the good reviews.,"The general quality of the recording is poor and I would say really low budget. Reminds me of a low budget horror movie, especially Sunshine's fixed grimace throughout. There is not enough time between each exercise to position the band properly and having to pause or rewind is irritating. The bands are nothing special. I really do not know how this DVD has got any good reviews unless Sunshine asked her friends to do the reviews! If you gave this a good review I suggest you get some other fitness dvd's and see what you're missing."
1,Poor Quality All Around,"Big disappointment!! The video is not able to be viewed because it has scratches all over it. It was supposed to be a new product, not used. What I could view appeared to be the quality of a home made video. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this, you'd just be throwing your money away like I did!!!"
3,okay but not great,"I give this DVD three stars because it's the only one I've found that focuses entirely on resistance bands, which is what I was interested in. However, it is only a mediocre presentation (all right, but certainly not five stars), and I was disappointed with the bands. The short one was appropriate for the exercise Sunshine showed with it, but the two somewhat longer ones were clearly shorter than the one she was using. I had to modify them by sewing on an extra strap handle in order to be able to do the exercises. Also, the chart struck me as useless. However, I do appreciate actually seeing the exercises instead of trying to follow along with little pictures in a book."
5,"High quality, high fidelity sound","I've had mine for almost five years and they are just now starting to show signs of wear. They've been on planes, all over Europe, and are regularly on my ears as I listen to audiobbooks while I clean the house. I can still hear the phone or someone speaking to me while wearing them because they are not blocking my ear canal, and the sound is true and very high quality. I bought a pair for my nephew and he loves them, too, so all I need now is what I came here for which is a replacement silicone cover for one of the earpieces. If I can't find one, I will buy a new pair in a New York minute, they are totally worth $30. (And the price hasn't even gone up since I bought them the first time!)"
2,hard to read,The book appears to have been printed from an original document. Letters are faded or partially missing. It's quite difficult to read smoothly without getting a headache.
2,Nice history,"A nice historical piece, and great if you collect economic history and trivia...but his ideas don't actually work. For a collector only, not for someone who wants to understand the economy."
2,Good airplane reading,"This book was a bit stuffy and slow, but that evoked the sensibility of the setting. Overall, an easy read perfect for a cross-country flight."
3,SanDisk Firewire Reader,The reader works great on my desktop but I mainly use my laptop for all of my photo editing as I do a lot of pics in the field. This reader will not work with my laptops 4 pin firewire connection. It comes with a 6 pin and 9 pin connection cord but no 4 pin. I went out and purchased a 6 pin to 4 pin adapter only to find out it will not work beeacuse the reader does not provide its own power. This is a definate problem with me as I use my laptop about 90% of the time for photos.
3,Loud fan that pushes air,"Due to a long rotating fan drum, this fan is loud on high and loud on low speed. I admit is moves air well, but get ear plugs so you can sleep"
4,New viewer.,"Don't have cable, so bought the DVD. Love the concept of the show, but Kate ruins it with her OCD & control freak behavior-berating & emasculating her husband constantly. She never apologizes when proven wrong, just makes excuses."
3,Not complete seasons,"I love this show, but I never got to see the ""Hit the Road"" episode where they go to Disneyworld. I got this DVD set because according to many websites, including imdb.com, that episode is supposed to be included in season 2. However, once I put the DVDs in the player, I couldn't find that episode on the menu! Even though I like watching this show, I bought it mostly to see that one episode (because it's rarely on TV and it's the one episode I have missed). I'm very disappointed. I thought the DVD set was supposed to include ALL of the episodes from seasons 1 & 2."
1,BCI-21 Black came with my printer,"I bought my printer/copier less than a month ago and it came with a BCI-21 Black and BCI-21 Color ink tank. I have not been using the machine that much yet and while I was copying a few pages which required black ink, suddenly the black prints just were not showing. I have not even printed more than 100 pages since I got my printer. I still have color ink coming out but black is missing in my pages."
1,The Miserable Result of Classic Meets D-Movie,"A seemingly intelligent reevaluation of Irving's classic short story, this well-begun adventure into what appears to be an elaborate string of murders quickly decomposes into a schizophrenic puree of mystery, zombie fiction, scifi, and slasher horror. Rather than develop a sensible plot, this revolting adaptation relies on every horror movie cliche to propel its quickly sinking storyline. When every last miserable detail is shoved under the door, no room is left for sensibility, a simple multi-dimensional, freezing of time excuse is given for why this plot makes absolutely no sense. Read the first two thirds and then put it on the shelf. Whatever ending you create in your mind will invariably be more intriguing than the sloppy, campy conclusion of this pedestrian deflowering of a brilliant member of the American canon."
2,Nothing new here,"This is basically a video of Oxford record store owners talking about their memories of Radiohead. In between, these memories are gaps in voice over filled with unconnected scenes of Oxford. I didn't notice any Radiohead music. And there was very little interview with band members. If you have done enough reading about the band to know that they were originally called ""On a Friday"" then you won't learn anything new here. This video suffers because of the ""Unauthorized"" Lable."
3,Good but need more,I am a beginner for long range shooting. I consider the book good for me to start but need more info about long range. Basically the info that is written in this book you can find it thru the internet. But this book can save you time looking thru the internet. I would prefer more info about this subject.
3,Another shooters story,"Everybody that shoots has thier own technic when it comes to shooting any type of firearm, and alot have to write books about them and people buy them. Shooting is something you have or you don't, bottom line it takes practice and you'll be shooting around corners and writting your own books and people will buy them."
2,Agreeing with Mr. Sonnenberg,I have to agree with Mr. Sonnenberg's review of this book. I think it's geared mainly for the beginner shooter. I also think it's over-priced since half the book consists of ballistic tables that I will never use. A serious shooter other than a beginner should already have their own ballistic charts for their rifles.
1,Simply the worst Star Trek movie made,"This was simply the worst of the Trek films. Aside from the horrible effects, the ""God"" complex that seems to grip the crew, unbelievable acting, and poor character development,the whole movie had a ""Nimoy did it so why can't I"" attitude. As a long time Trek fan I only have this video to complete my collection."
3,Why WOULD God need a Starship?,"A Clintonian Vulcan (he feels your pain), in exile for rejecting logic and embracing emotion, commandeers the Starship Enterprise and shanghai's its famous crew in his quest to find God at the center of the galaxy. The corniest of the TREK flicks, and the one that marks the directorial debut of star William Shatner (surely a coincidence--NOT).This film has some pretty good special effects, adequate acting, and some of TREK's greatest comic moments--e.g., Scotty bellows something about knowing the ship like back of his hand, then promptly gets KO'd when he bumps into the bulkhead--but the plot is inordinately inane. For the most part, only die-hard Trekkers will want this flick in their DVD collections."
5,Underrated,"This is one of my favorite Trek films, second only to The Motion Picture. Everyone thought it has really cheap effects, but this film was released in the summer of '89, in which more films were squeezed into theatres than ever before, which meant ILM had tons of films to give special effects to, and they couldn't be first rate for Star Trek V. So, they had to recycle effects shots from the other 4 films as much as possible. Shatner still did a superb job directing it. It has a great plot, and he made the film very reminiscent to the series, such as Spock, Bones, and Kirk going down to investigate the planet they are orbiting, in this case, Sha Ka Ree."
4,Beyond the Frontier&#65533;,"Mortality, Faith, Religion, God, Pain, Emotion, Logic - what doesn't this film have? The story is solid, and the acting is there. Yet there is something missing from this film which would make it a classic. The Visual Effects are pleasing, yet they do not push as far as their predecessor's or their successor's. The DVD quality is good, but not great. Yet the DVD is a good addition to a collection - the character moments are wonderful. The relationships explored (Kirk/Spock/McCoy of course, but the Uhura/Scotty relationship too!) allow the view to see what happen after a lifelong service - Friendship. Perhaps that is the real final frontier."
3,Captain Kirk's funny dream,"This movie, written by William Shatner, is best considered a comedy. For Star Trek purests, consider it a weird dream of Captain. Kirk, because it has no place in the Star Trek universe. In that context, it is fun to watch - for those who appreciate Mr. Shatner's sense of humor."
1,Plain and simple: this movie was worse than Star Trek I.,"William Shatner is the worst director that Star Trek (and most other movies, mind you) has ever seen. Thank god he didn't think he could direct Star Trek VI as well..."
2,It is STILL better than the first movie.....,"After hearing the story as to why this movie went down the tubes, I can appreciate what they were able to do just to make it watchable. Half way through the movie making, their budget was slashed dramatically, thereby not allowing them to get all the stuff into it that they wanted. In essence, they had to cut corners. I am not saying it is a good movie, but I don't believe it is worse than one. I will watch V twice before I watch One again."
4,About as inconsistant as America's foreign policy,"Star Trek V:The Final Frontier is, not the best Trek film by a longshot, but it isn't as bad as say, Episode 1 The Phantom Menace. It starts out pretty good but there are some inconsitances in the story which leave more to be desired. I have also heard that the deleted scenes probably would've answered questions like, who was the thing that claimed to be God and why did it zap Kirk, Spock and what the Hell happened to Sybock?! The film isn't a total loss though, since Laurence Luckinbill had an awesome performance as Spock's half-brother and the film was pretty exciting. The only thing wrong are the inconsistances in the story. It ends with still many questions to be answered and a lot to be desired, but it is still worth watching."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"The bittersweet sequel to Star Treks I, II, III and IV was indeed the ""Final Frontier"", one last voyage for our heroic Captain Kirk and the brave crew of the Enterprise - except for another one to follow. And then of course the several dozen spin-offs and spin-off sequels to follow. ""The Final Frontier"" sees a special guest appearance by the one character fit to take equal billing with William Shatner: God.And so this RiffTrax deserves an awe-inspiring guest appearance by none other than Kevin Murphy, Mike's riffing companion for years on the Satellite of Love! It's a RiffTrax lover's dream come true. (And Mike and Kevin promise not to make any jokes comparing the Enterprise and Charmin"
4,"Not the best of the Trek Movies, but entertaining","William Shatners debut as a movie director isn't too bad. The story is okay, the film is entertaining, the characters each have at least one good scene to be remembered - but on the other hand the FX are simply hideous. Some effects (e.g. the Barrier) looked better in the series! Still, I like this movie."
5,dvd movie,"this dvd movie is awesome, it really a good movie, to watch, I would recomend this dvd yo my friends."
3,hey it's Star Trek,You either like Star Trek films or you don't. This is one of the better ones but not the best one.
1,Ugh!,"Star Trek goes in search of God and blows him up with a photon torpedo - that's how I describe this show to my friends. I refused to watch ST VI for years because I was so insulted by this movie.""One God... many faces"" ""God is in here (puts hand on heart)""I'd rather have root canal therapy."
2,Does she even know how to cook?,"First, the good: I really like the seasonal format.Now the bad: The writing is pretty fluffy bunny, and doesn't feel like it holds much actual substance, but the worst part is that the recipes are god-awful. I was very disappointed because they all SOUND delicious, but I cooked several recipes in the book and every single one was exceptionally bland, and the proportions were all off. The pancakes, for instance, came out a watery mess with the worst taste due to not enough salt. We had to throw away the entire batch.The Kale, Corn, and Onion Skillet Cakes were good - after I completely reworked the recipe and quadrupled the salt.It's like Ms. Johnson didn't even try the recipes she wrote down."
5,In the forest book: so nice!,"I bought this touch-and-feel book used. Needless to say that a lot of supervision is necessary when this book is read by toddlers...We have already some Maurice Pledger's books and I still plan to buy more of them. These books are wonderfully illustrated, they make the difference. I highly recommend them."
4,A wonderful start...I hope the next two are like this...,"I just finished Shadowdale for the first time, and must say, I'm hooked! To be honest, I was hooked after only the first chapter! The author's descriptive dialect put me right into the thick of things, and I found myself frequently losing track of time while sitting down with this one.Awlinson's talent for character development shines brightest, in my opinion, within the character of the fighter,Kelemvor. It amazed me how much of a change of opinion I, as the reader, experienced as the storyline progressed through Kelemvor. Perplexingly, I found myself hating this man in one chapter, only to find how much I respected and admired him in the next! Stunning.Simply put, I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. If Tantras and Waterdeep are anything like their predecessor, we shall all be in for quite a treat."
4,Not as good the second time around but still worth reading.,"I remember reading this back in my grade school days right after it came out. At that time I read all three books in quick succesion and loved them. Thinking about all the fond memories I had about the books, I decided to reread the series and see how they fared on a second perusal.In the end, I found Shadowdale to be the best book of the three. It had a lot of action, a grand adventure, and good character development. Unfortunately, this book is much better than the other two. They pretty much stop the character development and focus more on carrying out predictable stories based on the excellent foundation created in the first book."
3,"A Neccessary Evil, but not a great book","This trilogy was written as an explanation for the transition between 1st and 2nd edition D&D. The D&D developers had a new system of rules and required them to be explained in this novel. As a result it read as a hastily scribed book with characters possessing little depth, especially Cyric. I'd like to give an example without spoiling the book so here goes. The D&D developers decided that someone in the realms had to die, as a result, the author had to write it. He makes the person who must die practically commit suicide out of pure stupidity. Very lazy writing and there are many events like that that take place. However, if you wish to play 2nd edition and want to be savvy on the events regarding the time of troubles then these books are a must."
4,Very entertaining fantasy,"I have read several Forgotten Realms novels and I rank this author right up there with Salvatore. Salvatore is better on the fight scenes but Richard Awlinson ties the whole plot together and develops his characters nicely too. This was a fun read and I plan to read the other two in the trilogy as soon as possible. Also, this is a great place to start if you are new to fantasy or to the Forgotten Realms setting."
2,Not that good,"Whiting is a pretty well known writer who has churned out a number of bios on WWII people. However, his bio of Heydrich falls short mainly because he spends too much of the book writing about other people. He spends numerous pages describing the people who planned and exectued the assassination of Heydrich rather than discussing Heydrich. Too much of his work seems to be conjecture and speculation also. While Heydrich is one of the most hated and fascinating people of WWII and the Nazi party, this book is not the best to learn about him. Unfortunately, there are few bios on this important person. One interesting thing about this book is Whiting's contention that the economic system set up by Heydrich in the 1930s and early 40s is the same one being used today by the European Union. Other than that, not too good."
5,"Now, this is dark beauty","I rarely hand out 5 stars, but this and ""But What Ends..."" so readily deserve such an honor. Just try to play this and not ""fall apart."""
3,A bagfull o laughs,Night Patrol is a fun-filled lowbrow laugh riot. Great one-liners and a silly plot surrounding the Unknown Comic. Linda Blair seems out of place here but when her swimsuit scene pops up...boy oh boy. A great Saturday night film.
4,A fun and entertaining movie,"This movie is fun to watch. It's not one of those roll on the floor comedies, but it is amusing. If you like stupid/crude humor you will enjoy this flick."
4,Great for electrical work,"As an electrician, I have to cut out many rectangular holes for switches and receptacles. This tool is much easier and cleaner than the RotoZip I was using before. It is by far the greatest for use on plaster and lath. I cut the plaster with the grit blade and then cut the lath with the saw blade. Worth every penny."
4,"A good ""whodunit""","ITCOMS enjoyed Judith Levin's second mystery. Although we felt it was a formula mystery,it really started with a bang. We all liked the Starletta Duvall character . Some of our more avid mystery readers knew and could identify the murderer after a couple of chapters or so into book. We discussed the book at length. Some of the members felt the black male characters were portrayed in a negative manner. All and all it was a good mystery. We would be willing to read a third novel."
2,Ok as a starter lotion,This lotion is not going to help you to receive the darkest color. I recommend Designer Skins Bronze Camo.
3,"Better, but still below average","I think Ms. Steele should fire her editor. There are so many run-ons and inaccuracies it hurts to read it. Ms. Steele likes to repeat herself as well. We remember things the first time, so please quit using wasted space by repeating it. The story was better than her last few, but can we get off the all are beautiful, famous, wealthy, and highly educated quick. I was cracking up with some of the things Allegra did as an attorney, check your facts Ms. Steele, that's what a publicist or agent would do, not an attorney. The attorneys would be lucky to see their star clients face to face. I think I'll stick with Nora Roberts, Amanda Quick, and Iris Johansen from now on."
5,The Wedding,"I thought the book was very good. I am a big fan of Danielle Steele. I have liked every book I have ever read by her, and that is a whole lot!!!"
1,sparkle sparkle sparkle and no substance,"I loved watching Dynasty, Dallas, etc. and this is basically what The Wedding is. Allegra (is that an allergy medicine?) is the biggest wimp ever, Brandon is the biggest jerk ever and NO, Ms. Steel, people don't go from 32A to 38D because of pregnancy."
2,I just couldn't get into this book,"I usually read right before im going to bed, and i just couldnt get into this book, the information was the same and it was all very predictable. Im sure that if i wouldve finished it, then i would have loved it, because i love almost all of danielle steel's books. If you havent read most of them, then your missing out, so stop reading this boring passage, and get into a book of hers."
2,lacking in some areas,"The book itself was good. But the parts of Simon and Blair were very much lacking. I found myself waiting for more of story on them being that they are the parents of Allegra, at least a little history or remincising on what brought on their marital problems. I found this to be lacking in a lot of areas."
3,a pretty good christian film,It was pretty good not the movie I expected but still a very good christian witnessing video
5,Excellent cookware,"This Mauviel pan is helping to complete my Mauviel collection of cookware, which I just love. The pan heats up quickly and evenly and has not had any issues with sticking. It's also pretty heavy! I do need to polish it, though, after almost every use, as it has a tendency to discolor when exposed to heat. I reviewed this cookware on my hubpages site as well at [...]"
5,Great All-Around Quilt Book,This is a great quilt book with a little bit of something for everyone. There are several projects I am going to make. I have made another project and taken a class from this author--and her directions are great with everything going together well. Simple piecing and simple machine applique combine together to make stunning quilts.
1,"Great Album, terrible sound quality","It is a great album,its hit song ""Lagrimas"" is a salsa classic. I remember playing my LP of this album when I was young, the LP had a good sound quality, I just bought the CD and its sound quality is terrible, like I am hearing an AM radio station. I am very dissappontment with this CD. A great recording deserves a good sound quality reproduction."
5,The kids love it,"I have a 5-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old grandson...they both love this show. My grandson will watch ""Choo Choo Mickey Mouse"" two or three times in a row and still say ""again again"" when it's over. So we loaned the DVD to our older daughter, his mom, so he could watch it at home...and then our young daughter started asking where it was because she wanted to watch it.So for his birthday in January, my grandson got his own copy of the DVD.All the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs are great. The kids watch them attentively and there are learning and thinking skills in each episode. This DVD, with the longer story instead of just a collection of half-hour episodes, is certainly the favorite around my house...it probably will be at yours as well."
4,Good product,Our 2 year old granddaughter loves Mickey Mouse. This comes in handy when we need a quick distraction for her.
2,Breaks very easy,"I ordered the item and it broke with in the first day, I returned the item and order the smae one again, which also broke after a week. You can still use it,but you have to make sure that it is charging, cause the conection is very bad."
3,Good idea but some poor execution,"Both the wall and cigar lighter chargers work just fine. I appreciate the red LEDs that indicate they are powered.The cable's plastic parts that fit into the conector on my Treo immediately crumble when plugged in the first time. I had to get a pin, and pick the bits out of the Treo's orifices.Since I had a Sedio self retracting cable I intended to use any way I've not taken action w' the vendor."
4,Its fine,"I am satisfied with the kit. It works fine. I didn't expect much considering it is a cheap kit, but for that I am very satisfied. It will likely outlast the technology of the treo and I will probably replace the treo in 2 years anyway."
1,Worthless,"I thought the other reviews were complaining too much for a cheap accessory, but I should have listened. It fell apart after about 12 uses and is now worthless."
1,Extremely short lifespan,"The idea of this is great: a single connector that leverages the USB format to connect to a wall connector and a car adapter. It's the implementation that really falls short. The materials used in the wires are too stiff, and the connectors are ill-fitting. I was able to use this about 4 times in my car before the connector simply stopped connecting. Since the connector from the car unit to the device and the wall unit to device is shared, this is suddenly completely unusable.I have other chargers and connectors that work just fine: the one that came with the Treo, and a ZipLinq retractable. Avoid this one if you are looking for an accessory that lasts."
1,Disappointment with Travel Kit,"I liked the idea of a multi-purpose charger for my Treo, however, the connector on the end of the cable that plugs into the phone broke after only being used a couple of times. From my examination, it appears that one of the copper wires in the plug that has to make contact with the phone became pushed back into the plug so it will no longer make contact and charge the phone. I have decided to purchase an OEM charger in hopes of finding a more durable product."
1,It broke in a day,"Hardware grade = F, the plastic cover sides to the wire connection broke inside the phone connection!!! I dont know why I didnt take the advice from previous customers!!! Dont buy this thing!!!! Great principle, poor craftmanship!!!"
2,The Naked Detective needs a coverup,"I read ""The Naked Detective"" because it was recommended by Amazon.com. under crime fiction books. The author apparently has written other crime fiction books which were well-received. This one is sort of hard to believe. His characters are not well enough fleshed out to be believable. His love of music and wine are apparent, but in Key West? The plot itself is forced and the premise that anyone this laid back and self absorbed could be a credible PI is hard to believe. I would pass on this book."
5,Awesome.,This is actually my favorite album of the FFR. They are amazing and worth at least checking out!
1,Does not work with XP!,I just can't get these drivers to work on XP! I have contacted Creative a days ago still... no answer! I wish that they would be able to get me a driver quickly! A driver that works!
2,very beginner,"This book was created with the beginner in mind. I started out using Flash 4.0, then when 5.0 came out I thought I would buy a book on it. This was the one I bought and it was a waste of money. It shows nothing new between Flash 4 and 5. It doesn't go into actionscript and gives no information on how to put complex movies together. If you want to make a box tween into a star, buy this book. If you want to learn to develop an entire site, find a different one."
4,Great book for beginners,"If you have no experience at all using Flash, this will be a good place to start...all the basic subjects of Flash, from the basic graphic creation using fill and strokes to tweening animation and publising movies, are well explained in the book.The only thing that makes it fall short of an excellent book is the very limited amount of information and examples on Actions/ActionScript at the end of the book which might confuse some novices on the subject. The book doesnt cover the more advanced features of Flash, so if you've already aquired most of the basics, you might wanna look elsewhere. If you do get lost at the last few chapters about assigning actions, a good online primer on Javascript can help you grasp the concept."
2,"Too plain, need some exercises",It is a book for beginners who know little about computer graphic. It doesn't give you much besides what you can do with the tools. You can't expect to find any special tips in this book. Too plain. Don't know why the instructor suggested this book. It is not as great as he told us.
4,A childhood memory,"Hey, this brings back memories of the wonderful 8-track. Mom bought this back when I was just a youngin', and I really thought Donovan was singing ""My Song"" with ""Happy Nessa Runs..."" What a weaver our Donovan is. I saw him a few years ago in Los Angeles before he released his album, and I felt I was in the presence of royalty..."
5,"Dramatic, lively interpretation.","The introduction is slower than several I have yet Andrew Parrott builds on a slow start to a satisfying, slightly measured account of this spirited work by Purcell commemorating St. Cecilia, the patron saint of music. The trumpets are expressive, declaratory and clean, the recorders colorful, the Taverner Consort bouncy. The singers create lush harmonies and the whole thing works beautifully. I'm not sure you can do better than the Taverner Choir or soprano Emma Kirby, the four tenors, and countertenors Kevin Smith and Rogers Covey-Crump. ""Hark Each Tree"" is masterful and well-articulated. ""Wondrous"" is truly that. No need to hesitate. Everyone needs four or five versions of this great work. I'm happy that I added this to my collection."
3,No Photographs - other bulk cooking books are better,I have to have photos in a cookbook so that was a big disappointment to me - I have several cookbooks devoted to once a month cooking and was primarily hoping to get all the details on setting up a cooking club with this book - I was disappointed on that end - only a brief portion of the book was devoted to that and you can get as much info from their website as was contained in the book
3,Step-By-Step Calculations --- Not Here,"I found the book interesting but not useful. Your best bet is to go to the EPA website for procedures on calculations. Some of the discussion on dry scrubbers and other equipment was useful but not in a form that can be readily used for calculations or sizing.If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."
3,"good as a horror movie, bad if you really want the truth","I saw an ad for this in Fangoria and saw that it had Kane Hodder in it and I thought I just had to see this. For being DTV, its got a good production. The first half is creepy, but gets a little boring, but its worth a rental. My only real problem with this movie is that its good as a horror film, but its hardly anything like how it really happened. If you want to see a much better movie about Ed Gein(the actor even looks like him), rent the Ed Gein from a few years back, its got the half faces on it. Its not really a horror film though."
1,This book is way too small and the questions were a little weird.,"Would you like to know about an experience your mom had at the dentist? How about if her parents every found something in her room that she was hiding from them? If so, this is the book for you! I ordered this to give to my mom but quite honestly, I do NOT want to know everything about her life. I want some key points with some treasured memories. Not only were some of the questions really strange, the book is entirely too small to write in. I'd be surprised if someone filling this out was able to get more than a sentence on a page. Ridiculous! I've already printed the return label."
2,Stopped working after 7 months!,"While this product worked, it did exactly what I need to do, which was transfer my cassette tapes to digital media on my computer. I did, however, have to spend a lot of money on software because the access code that came with the CD Spin Doctor, which you need in order to use the hardware, did not work (Of course technical support was not helpful). After about 6 months, it started making this horrible, loud static noise that completely distorted the sound and made it unbearable- even painful- to listen to. It works sometimes, but I have to restart recording whenever the static problem occurs, and that seems to occur every 10 minutes or so, so it is VERY frustrating. At first I thought it was a problem with my stereo player, but I unplugged the hardware and allowed the stereo to play on its own, and it was perfect. I tried using other cassette players, but the same thing happened. This is unacceptable for a product that has such a high price tag!"
3,"Hardware is good, but software is an issue","I'll give 4 starts for the hardware, but one star for the software. This does everything I wanted, with the exception that the enclosed ""lite"" version of Nero really doesn't cut it. I already had music editing software, so it was no big deal. If someone doesn't have it, they'll need to upgrade the enclosed Nero or get another one."
4,Good value for the price,"Had no problem with set-up. Had to make sure directions were followed exactly, though. Good deal for the money."
2,Not Vista Compatible!,"This thing won't work on Window's Vista and the company doesn't offer a solution. It was a waste of my money. I should have done more research, I guess. That's why I'm leaving this review. Buyer beware!"
5,Very telling account of the Zodiac Investigation,This is an informative book about the crimes of the Zodiac killer and the investigation surrounding the search for the killer. The author has went to great lengths to obtain info from the actual police case files and compiled events in chronological order. So much better than other true crime novels that tend to include speculation stated as fact.
4,"Chiiling...even in this ""police report"" writing style...","Full/comprehensive account of the most chilling (in my opinion) true-crime story of the 20th century. If you don't mind a writing style comparable to a Police Report, than you'll really enjoy this. I'm not a Zodiac expert (I read this after I saw an excellent ""Nash Bridges"" episode on a Zodiac copy-cat), but I can't imagine a more detailed analysis of those crimes and, since Graysmith was close to the action, his opinions carry weight. From what I can tell, this is the best account available of these crimes and I would recommend this book highly."
2,Wasn't as good as it should have been,"Author was just too long winded. I love true crime, but this book just couldn't hold my attention."
4,Detailed Story,"Incredibly detailed story with tons of factual information. Graysmith does an excellent job of displaying the facts of the Zodiac case along with his own opinions. Some questions, however, are left unanswered, which is frustrating, but that is because the case will probably never be solved completely. One of the biggest unanswered questions for me was why were the authorities never able to track down Kathleen Johns; she was the only surviving victim that spent a significant amount of time with the Zodiac. She was the only victim to actually see and hear zodiac and live.Graysmith's story is very similar to the movie however, there are a few details to the case that were left out and have a good amount of meaning relating to the case. Overall, it is a good read and will leave you wanting more."
1,Don't buy this!,"This book Zodiac is the earlier book written by Robert Graysmith, a newspaper cartoonist who became fascinated by the case of the Bay Area killer, Zodiac. In this book, the read identity of the main suspect is disguised. Instead, I would recommend Graysmith's Zodiac Unmasked, written many years later and revealing all the details. Neither book is well edited: I found myself often going back over previous pages because there would be a reference to a person or aspect of the case that had not yet been revealed in the book. A fascinating story, though, of Zodiac and the lives he destroyed.Zodiac Unmasked"
5,Fantastic,"Robert Graysmith has gotten a lot of bad publicity lately but this book is a must-have for anyone interested in the unsolved Zodiac murders.Graysmith lists everything he was allowed to write when this book came out. Thankfully, the sequel (Zodiac Unmasked) has the rest."
5,A Page Turner and Thrilling Mystery!,"I bought this book after seeing David Fincher's excellent film ""Zodiac"" and the book is even better! It's a real page turner! It's in diary format and is very suspenseful, told in mystery style. I was expecting a fact by fact book, but this is a story and the book progresses as each suspect is identified. Even though I knew that the killer is not caught, I kept hoping that he would be caught. Robert Graysmith is a very good writer and a great investigator! I enjoyed this book so much that I immediately bought ""Zodiac Unmasked"". If you enjoy a page turning, suspenseful book, then read ""Zodiac""! You won't be disappointed!"
2,Not as suspenseful as other true crime books,"I have read some really chilling true crime books as ""Mindhunter"", which is probably one of the best. However, this one cites a lot from police reports and is thus rather sterile than suspenseful. Graysmith names the chapters after the murdered victims and tries to weave a thrilling story around the facts, but unfortunately fails in trying.It might be ok to get well-informed about the case (although other reviewers here say that graysmith is ill-informed), but I cannot recommend it as a ""cant-put-it-down"" novel.Read Mindhunter instead!"
1,not informative,"there is nothing that shows where the wires go on the starter,and i really need to know"
1,only 1 page of information,"Only a very brief one page summary of this condition.Very general and not very useful.You can find better, more detailed information with a simple google search.Rip-off."
2,Cheap Price and It Shows in the Flaws,"The MyGuide 3050 is a budget GPS and the cost cutting shows. While the unit looks nice and features are good, the errors are constant and uncorrectable.IMPORTANT: The time / date of the unit will ALWAYS reset upon turn the unit off then on again. This is a major flaw as the unit will display a Error popup message upon syncing the time/date with the GPS sats. But this error message prevents you from using NAV until you press OK. HORRIBLE DESIGNTheir customer support in the US, which by the way is just one guy working under the company ""Ares Digital"", has confirmed this. He is nice enough, but don't count on the 2 year warranty meaning anything in the long term.Spend your money elswhere"
5,Eliminates shock,This dampener is essentially a strip of four dampeners strung together. You put them all on your racquet and they all work to dampen the feedback from hitting the ball. I've used it for a while on my Wilson nSix-Two a year back to reduce vibrations from the oversized head. The only reason I stopped using it was because I've switched to a racquet that doesn't vibrate as much so putting it on is redundant. I strongly recommend this dampener for anyone who is looking for a dampener to strongly reduce vibrations from ball contact.
2,Not what you expect from Donnie Yen,"I heard so many good things about this movie. I was disapointed. If your looking for good Kung Fu action from Donnie Yen you might want to check out Kung Fu Master, & Return of Kung Fu Master. circleoflifekungfu.com"
4,Seven Swords,Seven Swords is one of those marshal art movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Never a dull moment and when you think you figure it out something else is thrown at you that changes your thinking. Great movie and I recommend watching it.
5,bushcraft,"this book was written by someone who has obviously spent a life of 'dirt time' in the woods. It's easy to read, understand, and it's easy to pack along. highly recomended."
4,Great chapters on fire and shelter,"I thought the book was thorough on the subjects it covered. I am from Louisiana so most of the information was new to me, although some of it may be basic for you northern foke. The chapters on fire and shelter constuction were extensive and complete compared to the dozens of survival books I have read. Kochanski did not cover animal traps except for one for hares. The only other animal food Kochanski talked about was the moose. Still, I leared a lot about fire and winter shelter constuction. Except for the lack of information on traps and animals, I think it is a very good book on winter and cold weather survival."
5,Very Good,"Very good book, lots of illustrations showing in detail what the author describes. It will help a lot if you would like to need less things when you venture into the wild. All you really need is a knife, and axe, some cordage (rope), and some knowledge about what you can make from the materials at hand using those things. Would be nice if cordage making (i.e. rope making) was more thoroughly described, but I got the basic idea and then learned the rest of what I needed to know from the primitive ways website (they have great videos)."
4,"if your first read in the subject, you'll like it better","It's a bit like a textbook on a subject you really like. If you already like the subject, it means you've probably read a lot on it. Diving into a textbook on a favorite subject will leave you a bit weary - at best - given a textbook is designed to ""begin at the beginning.""If someone were to gift this book to a person just getting interested in getting along well in the outdoors...I think this would be a treasured gift. It is extemely detailed in the subjects it covers. Mors' style is very matter of fact and not narrative at all - and very detailed. The novice can delve into the material completely here.Again, to be fair, Mors wrote this in the 1980's. To still have it relevant going into 4 decades later says a lot about how good this book is. I have the latest version here on Amazon and it has an added section in the back with full color pics of a few things."
4,Excellent exercise for an out of shape 68 year old,"This dvd is excellent if you are an out of shape senior. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't really warn you that there are exercises at the end that you must do standing. It is not a ""seated only"" dvd which I needed because of hip pain. And also the squats are way too deep for seniors to do. But, on the whole, I recommend it to anyone who is older or out of shape."
1,Leave it Behind,This is a book that is written on a grade school level and is theologically unsound. I am amazed at the amount of educated Christians who believe this pap. What a waste of paper. Stick to C. S. Lewis.
1,A Word of Caution.,"I think it is important to remember that this is a novel, i.e. a work of fiction. As one who has studied the book of Revelation and the various ways of interpreting the book, I must say that the authors' grasp of theology is flawed. Because of this, I did not enjoy the 'Left Behind' series. The feeling I was left with was similar to reading a novel set in London, only to discover that the landmarks and scenery described therein did not exist.If the accuracy of the theology is not a factor to you, then you should enjoy the series. If you take your spirituality seriously, then definitely take anything written in these books with a grain of salt."
3,"Decent plot, poor writing","Another reviewer wrote that these books were written for a 4th grade reading level, and I would have to agree with that. Then again most local newspapers are written for the same reading level. I've found left behind series enjoyable, but I don't think I would re-read any of these books again.The character development is weak and LaHaye seems to pad each book with lengthy retellings of what's gone before. LaHaye also seems to think that it is necessary to repeatedly re-establish character's personalities and motivations, like 30 times per character per book. Like if Dickens were to preface every appearance of Scrooge with, ""Mr. Scrooge is an unpleasant curmudgeon."""
2,Didn't fit my blender,I bought this with high hopes for my Hamiton beach wave action blender. It didn't fit.
3,Product was perfect but service was lacking...,"I can't say whether it was the fault of the postal service or this company, but it took over a month to recieve my order. And there were delayed responses to my inquiries. BUT Goodman's did apologize and send an extra part for free! So I thank them for that very much!"
1,law and order svu season seven,I really liked this season but several episodes were scratched and I was not able to finish them. When I purchased this season I was told it was in great condition and it was not.
5,Law and Order-SVU Seventh Year,I have enjoyed all of the series so far. The characters in the series help to make the show worthwhile and realistic. The producers and writers for this series are top notch. I really prefer this show more than any other TV series that I watch.
3,"Great show, second-quality DVDs","I've ordered five different years of Law & Order and Law & Order SVU. In most cases the DVD's are horribly mis-printed. Much of the ink is missing and the bottom half is often printed at a different angle from the top half. Luckily they play fine, buy I'm annoyed at paying full price for obvious rejects / second quality merchandise."
3,2nd best single off odyssey #5,"People should know like a dog, kind of like an updated version of tail.Love my way is an excellent cover worthy of being on the album itself.Finally odyssey #3 is yet another good filler song, really should have been used on the album as fillers bewteen songs.Overall better than the meter but worse than my happiness"
4,"A thrilling, chilling experience!!","I love this book! I had no idea that there are still places on this earth that no one has ever seen. Bangs' account of what he saw and experienced is unbelievable. ""Heart of Darkness"" meets Indiana Jones. Awesome!!"
1,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!,"If you are over 50, overweight, or generally out-of-shape, this is NOT the way to start exercising. I've never seen a beginners DVD that you need to do oblique twisted abdominal crunches, yes, crunches (back on the floor, doing situps while trying to put right elbow to left knee & vice-versa). There are also other questionable exercises with weights that are not for a beginner. As you watch, all of the sudden, you need to have a bench with weights to continue the dvd. I sincerely do not recommend this for anyone just starting out."
2,Palmieri's best?,"how can anybody call this ""The Best of Palmieri"", if you've heard songs like: muñeca, Mi lindo Yambu, Palo pa Rumba and albums like: Mozambique and Champagne, you'd agree with me that this one is just another record. I'd recommend you left this one behind and go for another one, the only remarkable thing here is a track called ""Ritmo Alegre"" sung by Cheo Feliciano and that would be the only fact to get it, honestly that's a great one, nice arrangement and a superb Cheo's performance but that's all. You had better get choosing another Palmieri's album."
3,True Blue or Tedious?,"I read the whole thing, but knew when I started it what the foregone conclusion was, it just took a while to get there. One review mentioned getting to know the other characters in the story but I did not have any feeling of getting to know any of the others. Only Elizabeth who was sooo predictable, but she did redeem herself with a grandstand act in the end. The story covered the same ground over and over and over. Light, entertaining reading for someone that doesn't want to concentrate too hard on the plot. It can be read during commericial breaks with a TV movie."
3,"Wonderful suspense, perfect setting...","Will someone wake this sleeper up? A surprise thriller featuring Demi Moore. Beautiful cinematography; the location is absolutely what makes this story work so well. The story is set up beautifully, and leads us into twists and turns we don't expect. It was a little long, but, nearly all the scenes are intriguing. Absolutely worth a watch."
4,Interesting Drama With Suspense,"Demi plays an author who loses her son in a drowning accident. Afterwards, she moves to a sparsely populated island to get away from the memories of her loss and to bear down and do some writing. Just when it seems like she's ready to start over with some aspects of her life, she meets someone and .... this is where I stop as I don't like to spoil plots for those who haven't seen it.For quite some time during the move, you won't know in what direction it's going. It's suspenseful, I wouldn't call it a thriller, it's far from a horror movie. But if you like a contemporary drama set in very scenic areas and enjoy suspense, check this one out. It's not a ""must see"", but it does make for an interesting movie."
3,It was okay,I usually like Demi Moore but this movie just kind of tired. Didn't get the gist of what was going on until almost the end of the movie.
2,The Gaslight Twist Is Visible From 20 Minutes Into It,"I watched this on streaming for free. If I had paid money for it, I would be really unhappy. In short, it is not intriguing enough to be a mystery and not thrilling enough to be a thriller, to paraphrase an actual line from the opening scene. The story is not all that compelling, the acting is not all that great, and the ""twist"" is not particularly shocking or unique. Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. The primary saving grace is the scenery. The coast of Scotland looks amazing. And I enjoyed the score. That was about it. This is certainly not the worst ghost story that I have ever seen, but it it is not worth the time."
2,Iffy,"I rarely write reviews, but I thought I'd say a couple words. The plot was okay... nothing too original or surprising. I almost turned it off about 1/3 of the way through....it was so slow. I love Demi movies, but this one bugged me. And her teeth...my goodness...drove me crazy all the way through. The music was pretty much the same throughout. Not one I'd watch again or recommend, but it wasn't the worst I've ever seen either. The middle picked up and was kind of exciting and suspenseful. The setting was beautiful and it was a nice change of scenery from the typical American film."
4,Half Light,"I happened across this as a rental and after my wife and I watched it I immediatley ordered it. This is an excellent thriller with Demi Moore and the rest the cast turning in fine performances. Absolutely gorgeous scenery and great camera work make it like a work of art. Wonderful melancholy music adds to the overall theme of the movie. The story centers around a writer that loses her son by drowning. When she moves to a rural town by the ocean to try and move beyond it and write she is haunted by strange occurences and visions of her son. She meets a man from the lighthouse and finds a kindred spirit in him. When odd things start becoming more frequent she is not sure if she is being haunted by her sons ghost or if something else is transpiring. I highly recommend you at least rent it if you love a good ghost story, mystery, or thriller. If you enjoyed it be sure to catchDead of Winter.CA Luster"
2,I can't believe the good reviews,"The movie had some very interesting ideas and twists, but it simply falls flat. I generally like ANY movie that is scary or about ghosts and this just didnt cut it. Dmi's acting could have been much better as I didn't findher to be a believable writer or a mother. She did great with the suspensful parts, but in general, yuck."
2,"Beautiful film, muddy print.",This was a film I saw when it was originally released and I was swept away (no pun intended). I have waited patiently for a DVD release but was quite dissapointed in the quality of this print. It looks like a TV recording with awful sound.The film has a look and feel that is firmly anchored in the 70's but I don't think most Franco Nero fans will mind. The heroine (Shimkus) is trapped in the stultifying atmosphere of an English parrish house until a chance encounter with a bohemian couple and a gypsy on horseback sets her free.
3,Only if you like Cassatt,"If you aren't one of the many who adore Mary Cassatt's paintings, this book won't interest you at all. If it did not include lovely reproductions of five Lydia paintings, and if it were entirely fictional-not based on careful research about the Cassatts, their friends, and the setting, it would not be much of a read. I found myself looking at the prints repeatedly; Chessman elucidates the paintings in ways that empower both Cassatt's artistry and the relationship between the sisters that the author develops. It is a slight book in length, and often reads like a creative writing exercise (research a historical figure and write a story in the first person based on your findings), but there are moving, human glimpses of a moment or two in time, and if the book leads more people to examine Cassatt with deeper appreciation of her art, then it has served its purpose."
4,A delightful book,"The artist, Mary Cassat as seen through the eyes of her sister, Lydia. It is a rather short story with Mary's pictures included and the book is like the pictures, is entertaining, light, and charming."
5,Charming 19th C. portrait of Cassat family,"Charming, touching novella that is a snapshot of the Cassat family in their Paris apartment. A small book, but beautifully developed."
3,Delivery time was not as good as I expected,I am using the notebooks and they work fine. It just took a little longer to receive them then I expected. I have the Nokia pen because I went through three bad logitec ones and they (logitec) explained to me that they were discontinuing the line because they were having problems. The nokia is working fine and works with the logitec software. However the lines do not appear when you download from the pen like the logitec did. Not a big deal. I wish they had more paper in the notebooks but that's life.
1,Cage trap does not work !!!,"Havahart 1084 Easy Set/Release One Door Cage Trap for Rabbits, Skunks and Large Squirrels 24 x 7 x 7Purchased the trap first week of aug 2009. It has been sitting in our front yard more than three weeks and still no captive. Rabbits are still picnicking on our lawn. Baits vanished and have to be replaced three times. Apparently the food were eaten or stolen but the trapping mechanism was not triggered nor work. Money wasted!!!! We are highly dissatisfied and unimpressed!!!"
2,Think Twice on Top Release Skunk Trap,"Everyone was entertained on Facebook by the adventures of Pepe the skunk for an entire summer because I could NOT trap it. It had taken over a groundhog hole under my house that I neglected to close up right away after getting rid of the groundhog using another trap. Friends started to doubt the skunk really existed because it took so long to trap it. Finally, after a very resourceful friend added a metal spring to the trap, I was able to capture the animal. I had purchased this trap with the easy quick release on top since I didn't want to come face to face with a skunk, but there wasn't enough snap when the trap was sprung."
3,Decent macro lens for the cost,"This lens is pretty sharp and performs decent. It's focus is quite slow and does not feel like it is made at a high quality level as is experienced with many Sigma lenses. I did notice slight chromatic aberration at wide apertures which can easily be corrected digitally. There was also some vignetting at F4.0 and less, and this did happen on my DX lens although it was pretty mild and could also be corrected easily. The lens was quite sharp and my main complaint was in the fact that the lens extended when focusing which made having macro focus bellows almost necessary."
5,Sigma 105mm f/2.8 Macro Lens for my Nikon D80,"I bought this Sigma Macro lens along with the Sigma ring flash as a matched set. I am glad I did. Sigma has a good reputation and this lens proofs it. Great price and great quality. This macro lens works perfect, the zoom and focus work great on any close subject, I am truly impressed with the photos it produces. It works perfectly with my Nikon D80 camera."
2,"Okay, but not the best travel book","I've been to Scotland 8 times (my relatives live there) and I think the author and I have differing opinions on what towns are really worth seeing. On our most recent trip a couple months ago we used this guide to travel through southern Scotland, an area we hadn't been to before. We found a few of the towns recommended to not be worth the drive there. Also, it seems that the book was not really updated. One wonderful restaurant in Oban was not listed (Seafood Temple) even though it was the most popular and famous restaurant and one restaurant we tried to go to in Elgin had apparently been closed for about 3 years."
4,Pretty good travel guide,"Worth looking at for the person who loves to research a place before they go. Fodor's and Rough Guide are better. Not as comprehensive, but more readable than Fodor's. I think I liked this coverage of the big cities better, organization wise."
3,Dolly's House,"Good reading. Book in good condition. However, I wanted the booksold at Dolly's House in Ketchikan."
3,fun lightweight,the second part is ok but the first part is just a REHASH OF THE VIDEO titled EASY CHAIR EXERCISES so i felt really like i shouldn't have bought it.
2,Not what I thought it would be.,I got this tape for my wife to use because she was not able to do heavy exercising and it turned out to be the worst investmentI have ever made. It wasn't very well made and the person that did the exercises did not present them well. I wouldn't reccomend thsi tape to anyone and neither would my wife.
1,Out dated terrible book,The reviews and comments in this book have not changed in 13 years don't waste your money....and if you already purchased it demand your money back!!
4,The New Glucose Revolution,"The concept for the book sems to be well founded. Many scientific authorities are quoted and identified.The content is very interesting and well presented. It is filled with very useful information beneficial to the population as a whole, and those wishing to eat a more healthful diet in particular. For those with diabetes it is an improved idea for glucose control. For those wishing to lose weight it offers a practical approach to losing and then keeping off the excesss, while maintaining a healthy,enjoyable diet. Recipes and full meal plans are thankfully included, as well as listing of recommended foods. I call it very good."
4,Excellent book,This book opened my eyes about watching my glycemic index. I first became aware of it when I used the NutriSystem diet plan and noticed immediately that my tummy fat started disappearing. I realized that I needed to know more about the glycemic quality of foods since there is diabetes in my family history. I highly recommend this book.
3,"Interesting, great resource",This is a very interesting book with a wealth of knowledge. It is a great resource if you want to learn about the GI.
2,Looking For Information,"This book contained a lot of information, a lot of it was confusing. Unfortunately, most measured products are from Australia and other countries. If this book was revised or updated to better explain formulas and use US brand name products for measurements it would have been much more helpful to me. I do think the author is onto something."
5,a great gift,"Tasty good recipes and my children love the food in this book. I do not want them to have the weight and sugar problems I have had and this is a good one. One child uses it a great deal, the other hates to cook, but they both like what they have used so far and think it is good information."
4,"Great reference, poor printing",A fact filled book with tons of easy to understand explanations. This is not a how to guide for weight loss. If you are looking for a turnkey diet this is not for you. If you are willing to read and want to learn why you should change the way you eat then this is a good book.The publishing leaves a lot to be desired. It is printed on paper that reminded me of comic book paper. Very cheap.
2,Basic overview and strategyof Texas Hold'em,"Although the ideas presented in this book are interesting, I think a person would be better served reading a more lengthy book which presented a little more insight into hold'em."
4,Basic Strategy,"I bought this book as well as No Limit Hold 'Em Theory and Practice. I mainly bought this book just to refresh my memory on the basics. This book covered a lot of good notes on how to become a good Hold 'Em player. I wanted to read a book that showed the basic strategy and not get to complicated. This was definitely the book for that.This book contains a lot of the information for the old version of Hold 'Em. Most of the information still holds up to today's Hold 'Em games but for No Limit some of the strategy has to be changed. Towards the end of the book, it contains information on how to read hands. In my personal opinion this was one of the best sections throughout the book as it all came together how poker professionals become good at what they do.Overall this was an easy read, and a book for beginners."
2,Pompous Pontifications From Purveyors of Pyro Mendacity,"Once again, Dr. Ken passes himself off as an allged authority in the field. Have a look at the other reviews, from some anonymous person in Whitewater CO. (That you Bonnie Kosanke?) Whitewater is a pretty small place, after all. Didn't have the nerve to rate your own material 5 stars?"
1,Too bad there's not a zero star option,"Isn't it great to have INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC that critiques 50s American culture? How do they do that? John Zorn, that paragon of positive cultural constructs, is at it again. Snide, smug, supercillious, vapid--you name, it's all here. From the kiddie-porn art to the mind-numbing ""music,"" this disc is one of the worst ever made. It comes out of that same pseudo-hip mentality that gave us, God forbid, American Beauty, Pleasantville, and almost anything by Oliver Stone.All these America-haters need to get a life."
2,Pass on this one!,"Purchased this to go floating on the river. It lasted about 1 hour before it went completely flat in the middle and kept filling with water. We looked for a small holes or air leaks but couldnt see any reason for it going flat! needless to say it stayed at the river. It was okay to lay on but sitting on it was very uncomfortable. Not very big, I was able to lay on it and put my towel and sunblock next to me but there was no room for anyone else. One of my friends tried to just sit on the side but it was very unstable and became a juggling act just to get on and off the thing! not fun at all!!"
4,I HATE COMPS....,"but I like this one..many jamming tracks. Most comp CD's are let-downs but this is one of the best I've heard ever. I just gotted it and it's funny, 'cuz theres this new hoopla about the vines/strokes/hives etc. and the ""return"" of RnR and Wayne was ahead of the curve by a year and a half!!When your upscale SUV driving neighbors rave about The Strokes, slap them in the face with Quickie's ""Medicated (Just To Get By)"" and laugh as they run away....Wayne Kramer's been down with the underbelly of ""dangerous"" music when you were vibing offa the Kroft Brothers Saturday morning trips..He made a comp. of his fave music--outta print or not, you need it..........or you can hit the Best Buy and have them spoonfeed you what the top 40 decides is the ""return"" of RnR..Don't be a sucker--get it from here!!"
4,"Good picture quality, but very slow focus","Pros:Very good image qualityVery solid buildVery sharp when used with tripodGood priceCons:Extremely slow autofocus, AI servo mode is uselessExtends front element during focusingSlight CA detected in some imagesNot very useful in handheld mode unless lighting is very good (full sunlight)"
3,not bad,"i honestly dont see why this album gets so many bad reviews.its a solid effort from some talented songwriters. alone is a really good song it is the standout song on the album in fact.the album is not all that hard to listen to. yeah it souds alot like dream theater , but amorphis use so much more into the songs. i mean a sax on 5 of the songs . but really this album may only have 1 standout song but all of the songs add to the element of the album.the guitar texture throughout the album, is incredible. i ma\ean dont dilike amorphis cause they learned melody. and how can you say this band ran with the money i have seen and will never see an amorphis video on mtv. this album is a solid effort and honestly im looking foward to seeing what amorphis can bring to the music world."
3,Decent,"The album has some decent songs like alone and grave stricken heart. The music still has metal sound in it, yet its way softer and has little left from the great days of elegy and tuonella. Kinda of an album for metal fans gone old. Amorphis is great band, but i'm turning my attention towards opeth for musical dark metal. I've been listening to amorphis since tuonella came out, and it saddens me to see all these non-metal people jump in on after seeing a vid or hearing on the radio, and judging all the older albums they don't have the appreciation for."
1,What Happened!?!,"Amorphis had embarked on the direction towards being total sellouts back on Tuonela but this album dissapoints me even more! Not only is there absolutely any sign of metal within these songs, but even got rid of the northern ""Elf Melodies"" (as I like to call them) that I used to love this band for. All that's left is something that sounds like what you'd hear on a Top 40 radio station. Why would one of the best melodic death metal bands sell out soooooo bad!?!! My favorite Amorphis album and their musical and creative peak had to have been Elegy. After that they must have gotten some money waved infront of their faces and they decided to sell out! Perhaps if you're a fan of Alternative rock you might want to get this but if not do not waste your time or money, because it is nothing like the Melodic metal masterpieces they used to write."
3,Two Nickles for a Dime,"It sounds exactly like Tounella, thier last album. I mean exactly like it. However these songs are more like the B-Sides of that album. Pretty average and not very inpiring. I was a little disappointed. Hopefully they try to go in a different direction the next time cause this release is not that great."
1,"A Good Album, NOT.","I've always heard that Amorphis was a good band. When I heard this one, I wasn't sure if I was listening to the same band. At first I thought this band's music got mixed up with some ambient album. Sadly, I was wrong. Not only that, but someone tried to compare this to Blue Oyster Cult. HOW DARE YOU! B.O.C. are actually talented. I know, I saw them live! Also, I don't care what anyone thinks of this, at least Metallica (ugh) stayed metal somewhat."
3,An easy read,"This book was easy to read, and was written from a child/preadolescent perspective. The telling is a sad one, yet luck or chance intervened and Stella and her mother survived the horrors of a Nazi death camp. Most surprising to me was how quickly Stella and girls like her tried so hard to be normal kids after the war. So much so, that Stella kept her past a secret for years."
3,"Less Filling, Tastes Great","This is the first disc of this band that I have heard, and am suitably impressed. Good songwriting, nice vocals, and a warm well-engineered sound. I would agree with another reviewer's comparison to The Feelies, who themselves are sort-of descended from the Velvet Underground (Doug Yule era-think What Goes On). AAS seems to inject a little more melody into the mix, and a little less irony. Which, nowadays, is a good thing. Set Free has me definitely interested in digging a little deeper into the AAS catalog."
5,Free is good,"Amanset (American Analog Set) is a hidden gem of a band. This is a good CD to start with if you are interested in them. Know By Heart and From Our Living Room to Yours are the others I'd start with. I'm pretty baffled by the low-end grades this disc received. I really like it. It works as background, but it more than holds up to active listening. These guys are different and fun. Mellow and chill, but with some edge."
4,Jacket summary,"from the back cover of the August 1983 TOR paperback editionANGELS ABOVE, DEVILS BELOW...

3,So-So,"This was a good beach read. The atmosphere was great, the characters were well fleshed out and the plot was pretty tight. The only real problem I had with it was that the mystery isn't much of one. I figured it out about half-way through and spent much of the book thinking, ""It's *****, you morons!"" Sort of frustrating seeing as how they can't hear me.Anyway, I would suggest buying it used or getting it out of the library."
5,It works,I got these for my friend . He uses it to help the hair fibers stay in place . He plays soccer even two ones a day and it stays in place . It's very affordable . Before this he was using the brand the got from the hair club EXT I believe . We couldn't find any in sell here but we've been using the fibers and now the holding spray from toppik and he really likes it .
3,"Get it for ""Concrete Angel""","I'm not a huge fan of Martina McBride, to me she is just an ok artist who has some great songs.When I saw this DVD and the videos on it, I knew I had to get it.Like others have said the audio isn't the best, but that didn't really matter to me.I love the videos for ""Concrete Angel"", ""This One's For The Girls"", and ""When God-Fearin' Women Get The Blues"".The video is clear and the DVD overall is a great buy at under $10.If you enjoy any of the videos on this DVD, don't worry, just get it.If you really think about the ways you used to get your favorite music videos,(tape them from t.v. and hope that they played it all), this is better.Meaning it's also pretty nice for the people who are trying to clear out those VHS tapes.Get this ""LIMITED EDITION"" DVD now,before ther're all gone."
5,Great music,Love Martina McBride. Have seen her in concert several times and try to buy all of her music.
1,NEVER Buy this!. Stops working after 1-2 years,"I bought a HT700 two years ago and initially I liked it, played great. After 2 years it stoped playing all music CDs. Both mp3 and original audio CDs. Couple of months after that, it stopped playing 50% of blockbuster DVDs. I have a 5 year old $75 samsung player, that still plays great all kind of stuff. I don't think it's just the problem with this one panasonic system. It's all of Panasonic. It's just a piece of low quality stuff. They are just trying to sell to american market this piece of junk. Never buy any panasonic anymore unless you want keep buying every two years!!.- A disappointed customer"
4,a reflexive analysis of Western society,"This is a great book and a fascinating topic -- the way that Western peoples react to ""the other,"" from rejection to outright cultural theft. Content deals with everything from art and design to popular media portrayals of the ""primitive,"" to scholarly works such as Margaret Mead's Samoan study."
5,the kings of huge are back,"in texas, everything's huge. the galactic cowboys may not be mainstream, but to me they are huge anyway. whenever they make an album, it has a lot of meaty songs on it, they may not be heavy, but they're my brothers"
2,"Too ""Psyco"" for Me!","Woah, this mix is way to ""hardcore"" and way to ""psyco""!! I am very open minded with my 75+ ""electronic"" CDs, but this is probably my least favorite! This CD starts out ok, but by the 4th song, it is just way to unorganized, and fits the typical stereotype for ""electronic"" music. . .it all sounds the same..."
1,The too small spreader,"Precision Products 75 lbs. semi-comm. broadcast spreader. I purchased one. TBS40000PRCGY Model is to small to pull behind garden tractor, the wheel base is to short and will upset,so use the cover. fifty lbs. of pellet lime or ferizler will fill the one i received. not 75lbs. I ended up putting a 41 lb. suitcase weight across the front tubes this made it hold to the ground and not upset with load and the drive wheel will not slide. Handle adjustment is the bright spot of this spreader, sets easy from mower or tractor seat. This spreader will not work even in small yard unless you can put weights on it ,and the pipe tubes may not stand this very long. Buddyb"
5,A Great Book,McDonald has the ability to take strange and disturbing ideas and make great novels out of them. One of the few writers whose work I would read even if I disliked the subject matter. And one of the few writers who can toss away preconceived notions and begin to imagine what advanced biotechnology could really do.
1,Pass on this,Pass on this DVD the quality is very poor. It seems like it was copied from VHS. It is very epetitive. Its the same thing over and over again not to mention that the DVD is bad and continuously freezes.
3,"Fun, interesting book for kids, but very outdated","This book is one of my kids' favorites. It is easy to read for a first grader, has nice illustrations of lots of dinosaurs, but it is very outdated. I bought this book used and both of my kids love it, but so much has changed since it was written in 1966 that it is little more than entertainment. It is a book you might have read when you were a child and that makes it fun to share with a kid, but once you do a little reasearch on dinosaurs, you will see that much has changed about how science looks at dinosaurs since you were a kid. I only give it two stars because it got my kids intersted in reading something on their own and that is saying a lot--even if the material is outdated."
1,Witchcraft has nothing to do with the devil.,"This book is a huge waste of money. The title of the fifth chapter is ""The Rites of Satanism and Witchcraft"". Witches are in no way associated with the devil, and true witches do not believe in such thing. The spells in this book require ridiculous things such as ""the foot of a weasel"" and ""the heart of a sheep"". Most of them are spells to harm and even kill people. This is not true witchcraft."
2,pretty vague,"This was my first witchcraft book, and doing the spells were numerous and complicated. A certain spell that I cast to make it rain was done about fifteen times because I wanted to make sure I had done it right. It did rain, however. It took one week of building and one week of storm. I also did an impotence spell for my sister who had gotten ""accidentally"" pregnant...she had a miscarriage 2 nights later. These spells are very powerful, but you have to have patience and concentration."
4,Lacks new age fluffiness!,"If you are looking for white light fluffy bunny wicca, don't pick up this book. If you are looking for a concise guide to witchcraft this book will be a welcome addition to anyone's library.This book contains some source material from ancient grimoires, so be warned some of the spells and incantations may not be to everyone's taste/style of practice.However the later material on stones, herbs, and folk magick are quite useful and interesting. I also liked the info on talismans and planetary magick.Since the book can be bought for a incrediably cheap price, pick up a copy and check it out."
1,WARNING - Buyer Beware!,"Digisette will not back the product!! I purchased the DUO-ARIA 14 months ago and it stopped working. It has a one year warranty - after that your out of luck. I called and asked how I could get it serviced and they told me they will not service any DUO product. Basically, you're on your own - I didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did."
5,Great product,"Little cracked on the cover, but still in great condition for used cd! I am satisfied for the price"
5,Didn't buy the watch here but...,"I bought this watch from a discount online website and I love it! It's beautiful, just a bit sporty but in a rich mature way, and it keeps perfect time! I wear it with a tennis bracelet on the same arm and am constantly complimented. It retailed for $900 and it definitely looks like it! I recommend it for women of all ages."
1,WOMEN'S watch??,"My husband kept asking me if the watch seemed too slender for him..funny how this was labelled as a MEN'S watch a few months ago. Not only am I surprised to see it now listed as a woman's watch, I'll be returning it and I won't buy watches from Amazon any more. As for this being a woman's watch, while it was a bit slender on my husband's wrist, I can't imagine the woman who could wear this watch well. It is too big and gaudy for any woman I know. The face is beautiful for either gender, but it needs to be wider or more slender. I feel duped."
4,Worked for me,"I am a currently work for the federal government and I can tell you that this guidebook was a tremendous help in navigating the confusing job application process for the feds - from writing effective KSA's to making important contacts within agencies, this book will give you good advice."
2,Amateurish video,I will paint better and explain more clearly. Video is also made my some amateur operator; sort of home-produced DVD with one inexpensive camera and bad lightening.
4,"""Baby Einstein"" goes Catholic","Real world objects, classic music, children and babies to look at? Any baby would love this. When I first bought Baby Einstein movies, I was turned off by the videos that repeated nursery rhymes and songs. What is my baby really learning? If you're going to show them something, let it MEAN SOMETHING. My daughter now prefers Holy Baby to Baby Einstein, and obviously, I do too. Very quality, cool animation, and all the songs are well done (with the exception of the ever-annoying ""This Little Light of Mine"")."
3,Bad disc,I saw this film a long time a go and enjoyed it and was looking forward to watching it .But unfortunately this blue ray doesn't work on my player even though I have a region free player .So the manufacture must have included some thing that still stops these machines reading the disc . So I can not recommend this disc
4,An excellent depiction of the corruptness of journalism,This makes a sharp point regarding slander in journalism. A must see for all would-be journalists.
5,Out of control D.A. ver little guy,Extremely good tale of what happens when investigators run out of leads and decide to go outside the bounds of ethics and end up not caring whom they hurt.
5,Great new Author,"I pick this book up by chance, and found it to be a true page turner. He is able to add a bit of spice with well colored decriptions, such as the proper way to behave in the men's room. The plot is a real twister. You will enjoy every minute of this book."
1,horrible,"Absolutely horrible chainsaw. Avoid this thing at all costs. I had a Poulan 14"" that worked perfectly but needed something just a little heavier so I bought this, biggest mistake ever. It is absolutely impossible to start. Even straight out of the box, the pull cord was stuck, so I sent it back and got another. SAME THING. It's as if they purposely catch the cord at the factory. So I opened it up, freed the cord and it started up. But when I needed to restart it after moving brush that I had just cut, the cord was jammed again! So what Poulan? I have to disassemble the chain saw after every start?"
1,Junk,This chain saw is the biggest piece of junk that i have ever owned. I bought this saw 14 months ago and it is shot. I will never own another Poulan or Electrolux product again.
1,Poulan is JUNK,"This piece of junk would NEVER idle - had to be constantly restarted. Leaked oil all the time. Broke the SECOND time I used it. It's a $150 paperweight. Called the local Poulan authorized service center - they said that they were not currently repairing Poulan, because they seem to have trouble getting paid by Poulan. They also said that they are all made the same way - J-U-N-K. Never again."
1,Piece of junk,"If you only need to cut two trees in the whole life of this saw, by all means, buy it. But if you may need to use it more, turn your nose up at it. This is the second one I've had, because I thougt the first one was just a piece. They are mostly plastic, the chain oil tank is just a cavity between the two halves of the plastic body, prone to leak. The engine is ok, but the carbuerator is a cheap chinese made piece of junk (zama brand) that has to be rebuilt or adjusted with a special tool almost every time it is used. The caps for fuel and oil are course plastic threaded so after removing them a couple of times they rag out and need to be removed and put on with a pair of pliers, the magneto is held in with screws that go through plastic so they rag out... Over all a good doorstop, horrible chainsaw."
1,Chinese Junk,"I had this saw for about two years and used it a total of about 30 minutes. I have used a lot of chainsaws (Stihl, Husky, Echo, Dolmar, and others). This is the worst chainsaw I have ever had--poor balance, erratic running, everything of very poor quality. Get something else. I just threw mine in the garbage."
1,Very Disappointed,This flag is not what it appears in the photo very thin material it was not what i expected very disappointed.You can see threw this thing.
1,Poor quality,I received the items fairly fast but I do not think the shipping was worth the price I paid. Truely dissappointed in the product to find out that everything is painted on made my decission easy not to use this flag but maybe as a wall hanging. I will not fly this flag on the pole. I now have to order another brand to ensure the quality is better than this.
2,very thin!!,The product was what they advertised but it was very thin. I was looking for something to display in a case and this is not the flag for that. Maybe to staple to a wall or something but not for much more
1,Cheap quality flag...I do not recommend,"I am totally disappointed with these flags, so I sent them back. The photos on the website show heavy duty grommets and embroidered stars. You can even zoom on the photos and see that the portion of the flag with the grommets is a high quality material. I received the flags and got a PRINTED flag, with CHEAP grommets, and poorly sewn material. This flag should be recommended as INDOOR only....one good wind and this flag would not hold up. Totally disappointed and I think the website photos are a complete SCAM!!!! What a waste of time."
3,flag is very thin,"For hanging on my son's wall, its fine, but this is a very very thin flag and doubtfully last long if used outdoors. for the price and to hang on the wall like a poster, it fits its purpose well."
1,disappointing,from the pictures i believed i was getting a decent quality sewn flag turns out its a cheap thin printed flag very disappointed
3,American Flag,"I ordered this to decorate my sons room. The colors are vibrant and it looks good, but I expected better quality. I am used to the one the Navy gave us after my Father died. Each star and stripe were completely sown and the fabric was heavier. This suits it's purpose, so I will be keeping it. In the future, when we purchase one to hang on the flagpole I will pay better attention to the description.Thank you, Shannon Kosin"
3,Not worth ten bucks,"This worm light helps as far as visibility goes, but I am not completely satisfied due to the bright blue reflection it projects onto the screen. The little annoying reflection gets in the way of my gameplay. If I had known there was a light and magnifier with a dimmer switch (...) I would have never wasted my money on this worm light."
1,Darn thing broke,"After about two days of using this thing, the wire inside it snapped. I never got it to work again. It wasnt much good while it worked anyway, the light was so bright that it reflected off the screen and made it very hard to see. Very unfortunate because it would be nice to be able to see my game boy in the dark. Also this product plugs into the socket that is used for the game link cable, so you cant link with a friend while the light is plugged in. I would not reccomend this product to you."
3,To bright,"This Nyko Worm light is to bright for eyes. I have very sensetive eyes. Also, i found that i didn't use it much, because in the day you don't need it because of the sunlight, and if you do have it on then it gives off a little bit of glare. It's good if you go on a lot of road trips or live where it's not very well lit."
2,"Nice idea, but save your money!","While I have enjoyed my Game Boy a great deal, I cannot help wondering how they could have made it with such a hard to see, glare-prone screen. So of course I thought this light would be a great idea. Was I wrong! Don't get me wrong, the light works ok, but then, holding the Game Boy in bright light at the proper angle is also OK and costs no money. The light casts an horrendous glare that almost negates its usefullness and really does not light up the screen very well at any angle. Save your money (and shipping!) and don't bother unless you REALLY want to use your Game Boy in the dark or in low light conditions."
4,In the way.,"I bought a worm light for my gameboy color and though it is extremely helpfull for use in the dark it can also be in the way a little bit. For example it has a tendancy to shine alot of light on 1 area and not another. Also mine, on numerous occations, got loose and fell out of my gameboy, wich as you know in the dark can be incredibly annoying and can cause you to lose the game. Also a small amount of times it got in my way so that i could not see the screen."
1,"Agree with ""I can't believe this"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I was outraged!! This is not what women want. I too did not get passed the second story. I pity the man who can not satisfy a woman for he is not a wild enormous beast. As for Bluebeard to love a woman and give her what she needs is to break her physically and mentally!! I was outraged that this is being sold as truly what women fantasize about.
3,Interesting but left little to be desired,"I'm not really into anything graphic or racy so after reading the reviews I thought this book would be perfect for me.While it kept me turning pages, at the end of each story all I could think was, ""That's it? Really?""I'm not saying I need dirty words and lots of visual to peak my interesting but this is too soft, even for me. If your not into hot and heavy and maybe are just interested in seeing what ""erotic"" stories have to offer, I would highly recommend you start here. If you can handle a swear word or too, I'd keep looking."
1,Not very erotic,"After reading one story and then another and finding them not very erotic, I put the book away for a few days. I tried again on several occasions and found that none of the stories I read or skimmed put me ""in the mood."" So I put the book in the ""return"" pile (and unfortunately forgot to send it back). It was very disappointing.I am a huge fan of the Best Women's Erotica series. My appreciation of The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty by Anne Rice, led me to believe that I might enjoy this book. I was really disappointed. I do not recommend this if you are a fan of true erotica."
5,"essential reading for masking, compositing and channel work in photoshop",this book is the the authority on channel ops. don't be put off because it's based on an older version of photshop. i have cs3 and i can following the examples with no problems.
5,"It's energetic, powerful, something I've never heard before","I really liked ""Souls on fire"" and ""The Cross"" Very nice voice, specially the soft low key parts. Rythm is great, and has many sides to it. Hard to express the feeling to is, but it is very deep and powerful and some part kind of nostalgic. I definetly like it. Very new sound!"
5,Best Authentic Chinese Cookbook in English,"This is the best Chinese cookbook we have used. We love that these recipes are as close to possible as the dishes we ate when my wife and I lived in China. There is a guide at the front that tells about how to cut and prepare the various vegetables and meat, the different cooking techniques, a glossary of the main foods and ingredients used in the book, and a photo of the foods just as you would get them from a Chinese grocery store. Also there are many colored photos of the prepared dishes to show you what they are like. And there are suggestions for parties or full three course meals. We have almost worn our copy out because we use it that much. The recipes are just detailed enough for a good explanation but not overly complicated."
2,Doesn't meet my needs,"After a trip to San Francisco and finding dim sum much more expensive than the last time I was there, I decided to buy this book. It fell short of my expectations for traditional american chinese restraurant dishes. Way overrated by other reviewers."
5,Really Nice Chinese Cook Book,This is a really nice Chinese Cook Book. The graphics are delightful and remind you of the cutouts for lanterns. The photos are gorgeous. There are 96 pages in all and nothing disappoints. You can't go wrong adding this one to your collection.
3,not the sizes in the product image,Product image depicts that each pack of the pair contains:2 boxes of 500 + 2 boxes of 375What instead received in each pack of the pair:2 boxes 500 + 1 box of 750.....I ordered on the basis of believing I'd get the 8 midsized boxes. Not those massive boxes containing 750 q-tips in each.
2,Complete? You must be joking...,"The good: lots of big color pictures and plenty of stats.The bad: the recounting of each season is pitiful - every year up until VERY recent years (i.e.; the vast majority of the book) is glossed over in two or three paragraphs. Worse, each paragraphs is usually made up of one or two over-long, rambling and awkwardly written sentences. So yes, you see who won what when, but the color commentary is so useless it might as well not be included - pretty silly considering the amount of drama inherent in any given racing season.Honestly, I'd rather read one solid book about a single bad year than this poorly thought out book that purports to cover them all. You'd be better off searching for clips summarizing each season online than investing in this."
3,Missing Parts,item missing hardware pack 80505 and one slide lock 80513. Tried to set up for memorial day weekend and dissapointed. I am about to leave feedback on identical item ordered at same time that also did not have the hardware pack 80505.
5,flip top bench,"Made mine 8 feet long but the next time, will reduce the span by half.Sister dumped a nice roast beef dinner on the ground because the back wasn't locked but the pugs sure enjoyed it!Am making one for my son's tiny back yard (really a small concrete slab). More useful and durable than any flimsy bistro set I could buy."
2,huge dissapointment,"Fans of EA's MLB 06 will be horribly dissapointed with this title. First of all, the loading times are ridiculous. The game frequently freezes midplay as if it can't catch up with the action. Also, there seems to be no logic to the game. Pitches that you may connect with well one time will just ground out the next. I have played about 7 games with this title since I bought it, and i cant help but emphasize frustration. The controls seem like they're on valium half the time, as sometimes you'll push a button with no recognizable response. The bottom line is, when I play this game, I feel like I'm running a brand new computer game on a five year old computer, with totally inconsistent controls. Like I said, frustrating, especially if you come from playing the great EA MLB series. Look elsewhere to satisfy your MLB hunger, or seriously, just rent this first."
1,Disappointed,"This game is exactly the same as MLB 2k6. One thing I like is the complete updated rosters. The graphics are hidious. Every batter has the same batting stance, and every pitcher has the same windup! Corny!! (except the D-Train with the high leg kick). I was very upset that this game did not improve. The game even has false advertising, which on Tv and the web show great graphics. Don't buy this if you are hoping for a baseball video game with sincere graphics and great gameplay. This has neither. The music playlist and rosters are the only thing good about this, which is why I put that one and only star on there."
1,Poorly Made,"This game has so many glitches, I don't think i'd be able to name all of them within a few paragraphs. I actually prefer 2k5 better than 2k7. The graphics are much better, the flow of the game is much more smooth (Without Lag) and there aren't as many little glitches. I encourage all buyers to NOT purchase this game better yet rent it like I did.Thanks to this game, and other 2k sports games, I will only buy EA Sports games.EA SPORTS NEEDS TO MAKE ANOTHER BASEBALL GAME. MVP Baseball was bomb!Ok, I'm done."
5,3M Dry Guide Coat,"Very easy to east to use, Be careful where you set it down. I knocked it over, only a small amount of powder Good coverage. You can cover the whole panel and then your high/low spots show up without missing a small spot that you might with the spray."
5,You may find a great talent,Brad's music is like softiscated ethnic food.It have strong character.But DELICIOUS.Beautiful.This album may be 3rd album of his own.And this trio has used guitar trio format of Jazz.One of grat drumer Jim Black plays Drums.Scott Colly plas Bass.They shows thier talents in there. thus Brad has joined Pachora.This is also great.But This album'Short Trip' is differentfeeling of Pachora.Yes.you can go to Short Trip.
4,A ray of Sunshine,This is a great idea. I don't know what I would do without this little gadget. Sometimes though you need to reposition so there isn't a glare on the screen.
4,Nothing else like it.,Well done and very funny! Hard to believe much of it was adlibbed. Kudos to the actors for being so funny and believable. Director Jared Johnson's bizarre sense of humor is at its best in this piece of fiction made to look like a documentary. The idea of a documentary about a man who may have turned into a horse is an idea only he would cook up. If you want to see something truly original then I recommend this short movie.
5,best beauty aid ever,"If you want soft skin, try exfoliating with one of these! I feel an immediate difference after using this."
4,Good book for quick info before you plant,"I like the book for a quick reference if I am planting something new. It also had plants I'd never heard of so that was interesting. No, it is not a definitive guide to every plant that COULD be planted in Georgia, but who cares? It does have plenty of favorites and plenty that you can find easily at your local nursery. I don't care for books that mention plants that I fall for then can't find anywhere. This book is divided into sections that are easily to follow, it has pictures galore, and it gives basic planting/care info for all the plants listed. I found the advice on when/how much to fertilize the plants helpful. The fact that I have such a hard time finding similar info for plants not included...my penstemons for instance just reminds me of how good the information they give is. It's basic enough for anyone to follow but not oversimplified."
3,"Slow paced, but effective","This movie is worth a rental, at best. It is dubbed in English.The minus part is the slow moving plot. It's in no hurry to get anywhere fast, and it will reveal it's secrets when it wants to. That took the two stars away for it in my opinion.The plus side is the eerie photography and the atmosphere of dread. A lot of the scenes appear blurry and washed out, but it adds to the surreal eerie atmosphere. And when the ghost does appear, there are odd sounds with her that remind one of ""The Grudge"".One of the leads actually steals the movie with her acting and just how convincingly mean she made her character.it is worht a watch, it is a foreign dubbed film, and not of the usual pacing and photography of the American movies."
5,"Prepared,Safe and Relaxed",I learned all I needed to know.I followed the book did the tapes and I truly was able to transcend the pain and the fear of labor.My pregnancy was a joy and so is my peacefully birthed baby
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is more like a pamphlet (100 pages) and focuses mainly on hidden guilt and fear in the mother. It does not teach you anything about what your body is really going through in labor. There are about 5 pages in the back devoted to the ""technique"" which is really just progressive relaxation, which can be found in other resources. I did not order the tapes because the book was not what I had hoped. I gave birth without any interventions with the help of the Bradley Method and highly recommend Birthing from Within and Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way. They are much more complete and also helpful to the birth partner."
4,Cher is wonderful and so is this movie,"I have watched this film several times since purchasing, and I always find if just as entertaining and suspenseful. It's one of those films that never gets stale. The main draw here is Cher who is always a joy to watch whether in film or in music. I loved her role and the story as a public defender trying to prove a mute, homeless man innocent of a brutal murder as she searches for clues, trying to uncover the truth. In a male-dominated cast, it's great to see the strong woman go up against all the men in the name of justice. And those courtroom scenes are such fun to watch. Definitely worth owning! Also recommended with Cher: Silkwood with Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell"
4,Well done,Have seen this before but I always enjoy this mostly because of Dennis Quid and Cher. The story is good and better each time.
4,Great for little ones!,"We love the ""That's not my . . . "" series of books. They are great for bedtime reading with very young children (or anytime really). They are board books that are smaller in size, but that makes it easier when you are trying to balance a book and a baby/toddler in your arms. Each page has something the child can touch and feel. It has few, easy to understand words. It also has the little mouse on each page that your kid and find for added fun. The books are thick and sturdy. They are about 5 open pages. The robot book specifically is great for your little robot loving guy (or girl). The cover has eyes you can touch and shiny stars. Each page has a robot which is ""not my robot"" until you get to the last page of course. Each robot has something to touch and feel or something shiny to look at. It is a fun little read that has had many repeated readings in our house."
4,Knives no longer such a mystery thanks to new book,"Author Marc Newman has succeeded in his 1998 book Civil War Knives in going a long way toward filling a void that has long existed on the subject of, as the title indicates, the many and various types of knives used by both sides for everything from preparing meals to rendering the enemy hors de combat. The book is well illustrated with clear, sharp photos of the knives. The text, although somewhat lacking in descriptive quantity, more than makes up for it in the quality of writing. My only wish is that he had described the sheaths of those knives which have them. Marc has gone a long way toward supplementing the work begun by Abels, Peterson and Albaugh a number of years ago."
3,Stereotypical Gothic,"The contrived situations, coincidences, and overwrought events in this book overwhelm what little character insight and logic are there. Plot-driven, it does engage the way an old fashioned horror movie might, but there are repetitious circlings in the narrative and such helplessness in the protagonist that reader frustration is inevitable. I would have loved this book as a young teen had I been able to master the older English."
5,Great buy,Thank you for a great buy. The price was the best I could find and the purchase and delivery were quick and easy.
2,Don't believe the hype,"Many magazines have been giving this item rave reviews, but I can't understand why. Sure the design is elegant and innovative, but it makes games almost impossible to play unless you are in absolute darkness. The glare from this light is just plain ridiculous, and the only way to decrease it is to bend the light to one side, which decreases the amount of light on the screen. There has GOT to be a better way to light up your gameboy, and let me tell you, this is NOT it."
4,It's good.,"This music is rock and dream together, really quite beautiful, especially after the first listen. You really get to appreciate Krug's unique, raw and tender voice separated from the louder Wolf Parade music. But there's no comparing this record to Apologies to the Queen Mary."
1,Didn't work for me,"I couldn't get this product to work, at least not consistently.Since it doesn't have an external power supply, it appears to draw power from the USB connectors you hook up to the two computers. One isn't enough to keep it happy, it just flashes it's LEDs (yes I had it hooked up directly to powered USB ports on the computers themselves). So if you have one of the computers turned off, or sleeping, you're screwed.When I did have both computers turned on, it would lock to one of the two computers and no matter how many times you pushed the switch on the top it would only temporarily switch to the other computer, then almost immediately switch back. No obvious reason.Then of course there's the design--this is intended to go on your desktop? With cables out both ends? If all the cables hooked up to the back or something that might make sense.I'd have to say this product continues my experience with Belkin products--generally unimpressive stuff. Buy from another vendor."
4,so far so good...could use 1 more feature (see review),Bought it about 1 month ago. I've had no problems with it at all.the reasons it doesn't get 5 stars are as follows:1. the online documentation is contradictory (1 part says that it won't work with Linux OSs and another part says that it will). This required me to call Belkin tech support to verify that it does indeed support linux.2. there is another version of this device (I believe for ps2 connections) that has a keyboard shortcut for switching between machines. This particular version (USB) does not have that feature. It would have been nice to have.
4,Great phone,"Do yourself a favor & pick one of these up before they are discontinued, this is an excellent phone, easy to use in every way. The only reason I need a new one is because I dropped my last one too many times."
4,Superior retelling of Robin Hood,"I sampled several versions of the Robin Hood stories before originally purchasing Howard Pyle's ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"". Pyle is fine, but a bit too wordy and stiff for my taste.I found a used copy of McSpadden's ""Robin Hood and his Merry Outlaws"" which, though using similar archaic language, has been more conducive to light reading and reading aloud; for that reason it is probably a better choice for younger readers as well.(I would be interested to learn if there is a still better choice than McSpadden.)I give it 4 stars because, while I like the McSpadden's prose and the simple B&W; drawings by Louis Slobodkin are pleasant, the World Publishing Company (1946) edition itself, part of a ""Classics to Grow On"" series, is designed to be used and abused by children rather than grace a collection. (It appears there may be multiple versions published in '46, or at least different covers.)"
3,GREEN CRYSTAL PENDANT,"THIS PENDANT IS VERY PRETTY, BUT DOES NOT REFLECT LIGHT LIKE I EXPECTED IT WOULD. I LIKE THE COLOR, WHICH IS UNUSUAL, BUT THE SHAPE IS A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN EXPECTED. EVEN THOUGH MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE REFLECTED IN THIS REVIEW, FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES LARGER JEWELRY, IT IS A VERY NICE PIECE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT AND IT MAKES A NICE GIFT."
2,Love the beats but not the lyrics,"I have never liked Nivea but my friend told me that her second album was really good. So she let me copy it and the first few songs were cool but as I listened, I listened to the horrible lyrics. She needs a different writer when it comes to her work."
3,Worth a listen.,"Before I begin I would like to say that this CD is so much better than her debut album.This CD has a lot more emotion, and if I'm not mistaken, her voice has improved. But there is still quite a bit of filler on this album. R.Kelly brings some of his worst production to date to the repetitive song ""Gangsta Girl."" And ""I Can't Mess With You"" is not much better. But heartfelt songs like ""No More"" and ""It's All Good"" are inspiring and make this album worth a listen. (And even though, I've never been a fan of Lil' Jon, I must say that I'm quite impressed with ""Okay."") It's worth a listen."
4,you gotta love her,she's doing big thinges i mean she's married she's having a baby and on top of all of that she has this good project out she's making sure she stay on top of her game p.s. i know that this insn't about the cd but my screen name is the d man so look for it
4,I have only heard this one song,"When I first heard Okay....well....it is very catchy, I mean Nivea does say Okay a lot. But this song had a good beat, and good people singing it it too! I really enjoy Okay, it makes me happy everytime that I hear it come on!! I love it!! You should definetly get this CD, she has a great voice, and a great CD!!"
4,Second Time Around Not Really Complicated,This is a really good album.The intro and interlude do sound a bit cheap and unprofessional.You can't really hear what shes saying but skip to number two and its all good.Its obvious to see she did what most of these singers out here need to do..(((practice and take lessons to improve yourselves!!!!))))1. Rain (Interlude)2. Complicated (3/5)3. Okay (4/5)4. Parking Lot (4/5)5. Fulton County Correctional Call (Interlude)6. I Can't Mess With You (4/5)Nic ebeat sounds like a future single7. Breathe (Let It Go) (5/5)8. Quickie (5/5)Sounds like could be likely single9. Indian Dance (4/5)10. No More (5/5) SHOWCASE HER ABILITY TO SCREAM AND HER RANGE11. Gangsta Girl (2/5)12. Okay [Remix] (5/5)Smooth relaxing and better than the original13. So Far (3/5)OVERALL GRADE = 89/100 A
2,Incomplete Product,This CD is a 2 disc set. The seller only sent 1 of 2 discs included. The set was incomplete and I was not informed of this before or after I bought it. Future buyers BEWARE!
3,Someone set the drum machine to auto,I normal like this genre of music but this double CD is just mixed beats and nothing new.
4,On the fence??,"I worship Naked Music and have been previously dissapointed with previous migs projects. 24th St. delivers in a big way if you already like Bare Essentials and Carte Blanche. Disc 1 is a new favorite for me despite a jazzy, muzaky start. Make room for dance with this on your Ipod, you'll be completely overcome by the sound and the style of this incredibly endearing combination of great beats and sensual motives. I was on the fence about this one as I don't love everything I have by him. I'm telling you to jump in if you love your music naked. This one's a really good time! Don't listen to anyone, try it for yourself and see. Something for everyone here, perhaps you'll just love it all as much as I do!"
5,"Prompt service, wonderful book","The item was most promptly shipped by the seller, and I received it within three days. The book was in excellent condition for its vintage, and I loved the thick old fashioned pages from years gone by. The writing was of course excellent, as I knew it would be. I am a huge Isek Dineson fan, and if you are not familiar with her writing, you should become so. No one writes a memoir as well."
4,Very Good.,I like Lou D.P. and I think he gets better with every movie he does. Its is good to see good updated Westerns coming back to the screen.
5,Sub Terrain,"This DVD is wonderful for the beginner, gave me the confidence to build a 4 tier model RR layout, very easy to do once you have been shown how and this DVD does just that."
1,Convoluted. No real value above the standard red book.,I was hoping this book would help with a project I was working on. Unfortunately it was vague and had no real depth. In the end I bought Mark Kilgard's excellent book on X Windows and translated his excellent descriptions and code examples into the equivalent wgl functions. I also bought OpenGL Superbible which is better than this for wgl functions.
1,A clunker,"The ""reader from Princeton, NJ"" hit it on the head when he called this book ""Horrifyingly Undercooked"". DO NOT try to read the sections on understanding translations and rotations, the author is a klutz at explaining it - just use the ""Red Book"".The only thing I got out of the book was to take one of the early simple sample programs to start a framework for building my Windows-based application(a flight simulator). The OpenGL SuperBible is much better, wish I would have known about it first."
5,"Easy, cheap Bench","Is easy to assemble, pretty much. We didnt have any problems. Makes a great looking sturdy bench. Costs for the lumber in Beaumont/Port Arthur, TX area ran me about $20 for treated wood. Not bad at all!I like the fact it is something we can proudly say, We made that!!!"
4,Beautiful Illustrations - Engaging Story,"My six year old loves this book. A bit much for her to read on her own, but we enjoy it thoroughly."
5,Is it school?,"I am doing preschool activities with my grandson. As a retired elementary teacher, I was looking for things that would be both fun and educational. Right now, we use these to name letters (pull them out of a bag and name them. We also spell his name. Later, we can start blending sounds to make words. I especially like both lower and upper case letters on the same cube."
3,Good but not exceptional,"Everything the other reviews say is true. However, we bought it in the hopes that it would help us navigate some serious back roads on our vacation, which it doesn't do very well. It shows the location of most of them, but never with street names. So unless you know exactly where you are on the map, you can't expect it to save you if you're lost in the deep country gravel roads of New Zealand. Other than that, we did use it heavily and successfully for navigation as we drove from the very northern tip of the north island to the southernmost point of the south island on the main roads. But if you're not going to stray far from those main roads, the free maps you'll get from the rental car agency, hotels and tourist info points will do you just fine."
3,replacement parts,"We bought this crib in Minnesota at Babies R Us. It was a very pretty crib and it went with our decor. The problem I had was assembly. I ended up breaking one side where the screws went in and had to ""rig"" it up with cable ties in order for it to work. I have looked for replacment parts all over the Net and have yet to find any. Does anyone know where I can find replacement parts?"
2,Very overpriced for quantity,"This is just an overpriced version of your drug store house brand, in an ampule that is hard to squeeze. If you are older or have a shakey hand, avoid this product, as some of it will land on your cheek, and you will run through it very quickly.It is a POOR selection for the typical senior with a limited budget who has other other health issues. If you got a sample, you need to understand that your Dr. might recommend the brands on hand, the ones where the sales reps gave his/her office free lunch and samples! For this product, Quality probably is fine, but it is definitely ""QNS"" - quantity not sufficient!"
1,Poor product.,This cover lasted for about 2 days before the clips that hold the cover to the phone broke. This is the second one that I bought.JUNK
5,The BEST DVD I've ever had!,This is an all around fantastic DVD. I had never heard of Shiva Rea or Trance Dance before. The DVD has the ability to program whatever kind of dance/yoga session you feel like from relaxation to energizing dance. I wish she had more that I could buy!!
1,Extremely disappointed,If you expect fluid movements done as a dance that give a good work out don't buy this DVD. If you are looking for an esoteric experience then this is for you.
3,Whats the point?,My wife and I love to dance and love yoga. But we just didn't see the point of this DVD - upon first viewing we thought it was kinda dumb.
2,Still don't know how to dance,"This DVD was indeed stupid. I was hoping for some instruction on how to do the dance movements or at least attempt the yoga trance. Nope. No instruction, just random flopping of body parts. Pretty scenery, but with a bunch of hallucinating hippies dancing around in it."
3,"Solid, educational book for a group study",Our women's group at church has studied from another book by D. Connelly. The leader's notes are s beneift and the questions are thoughful and discussion provoking.We are very satisfied.
3,tunes not as musically interesting as Juliana's efforts,"I would give this effort 2 1/2 stars. I certainly don't dislike it, but compared to Juliana's 'Beautiful Creature', which is chock full of excellent tunes, there's not enough here that grabs my attention. now, I'm basing my reactions to the music, not the lyrical content, and in comparison to Juliana's solo albums. I'm no Blake Babies expert, but have heard 2 or 3 previous albums and enjoyed the jumpy poppy sound of a lot of that, and more than this album.I realize that most people place much more emphasis on the ""meaning"" behind pop songs, but I tend to like music for the music, and if that isn't there, great lyrics won't carry a song for me. these songs use structures and chord changes that offer no surprise, and are faily repetitive.so... if you're a fan of Juliana's music (regardless of what her words say, though there is substance there as well) I would say watch out before automatically buying this disc."
1,Save your money,"This was the third and LAST Shuttle PC I will ever buy. They are plagued with heat problems, very very bad support and poor quality control. All three of mine are now relegated to the junk heap."
4,Neat old tube manual,Interesting old book from a time when vacuum tubes were everywhere and in all kinds of electronics. I'm using it as a reference for guitar amp building. Arrived in good condition for it's age.
4,Encompassed a wide variety of disciplines,"I learned a lot from this book, since it covers a diverse selection of academic and scientific research. There were a few typographical errors, but I realize that's nitpicking. It made me very hopeful about how I can improve my own life. I highly recommend it for anyone; no matter what your interest or beliefs, there's likely to be something here for you."
2,never cry werewolf- not wh en you copy fright night!,"this movie is cut rate, and suffers further for not having the quality of acting that fright night had, even that sequel. worse, it was not closed caption. talk about cutting corners. save your money!"
1,Battery does not work,The battery does not work properly. It does not charge more than 59% of its capacity.
1,Pathetic use of defenseless dog to name drop,I agree with the several other 1 star reviews. I can't believe this book was published. I guess she knew someone. She isn't funny -she doesn't know from funny to paraphrase her. She used the poor dog as a beard just to name drop and tell about her luxurious self indulgent lifestyle.
3,Best bar in any game I've played yet,"I really enjoyed the bars & songs. Just awesome. The playing was fun, the rat scenerio was awesome. Overall, this game was fun but not intense. This is not addictive but worth the money. Pretty easy to catch on which was great for this new gamer."
3,"Great idea, poor execution","I liked the concept of Bards Tale but quirky and fun does not equal ""good"".It suffers from a lot of the same problems that so many games suffer from Its flashy it looks cool, but it is way too short and has absolutely no replay value.Its not its fault it just suffers because its an Xbox adaptation."
4,sawer,"The chain saw comes with an excellent, detailed manual that was helpful for getting started with a new machine. The saw performed well, and quickly cut through the limbs and branches I hoped to reduce in size. Also impressive was the nearly overnight delivery of the saw despite paying only for regular postage."
4,Satisfactory Saw,"Needed to take down some small trees; this saw did the job. Went through 6-8 diameter branches with ease. Does not come with oil, so make sure you have some on hand if you want to use out of the box."
1,"Poulan 16"" 3.5HP electric chain saw",The saw would not pump oil. It was worked on 3 times before it decided to pump.
3,"Nice review, but too basic","It was a nice review for my first semester of organic chemistry, but it was too basic for my college course. I am required to go into much more detail and mechanisms than this book even mentions. good for intro and as a supplement if you really need it, but dont rely on it to get you through."
2,2 stars is pushing it,"Although some of the information is helpful there are also numerous topics that the book fails to cover, for instance arenes. Just do your homework and get organic chemistry for dummies if you feel you need a supplement text for the course."
4,OK,i was expecting near perfect balls... some were scratched pretty decentley. not sure if i will buy again. it's hard to beat the price though...
3,the sad song,"does anyone know the name of the song that plays when the gang shows up at the old mystery inc. headquarters? the one that goes ""i'm on the outside looking in"" if anyone knows the name please tell me."
5,Invaluable resource for therapists working with dancers,"This is an indispensable resource for the physical therapist or Pilates instructor who works with dancers. It covers functional anatomy as it relates to the dancer, teaches the analysis of posture and movement as it relates to the classical dancer, the typical injuries sustained by dancers and their management and rehabilitation.This text, combined with Sally Fitt's, Dance Kinesiology, should be in every therapist's library. If the book has one fault, it is that is focuses almost exclusively on classical dancers."
5,J Yacola,"Absolutely worry free transaction. Was extremely pleased with the over all quality of the item. The crane is easy to operate. Would suggest more than one load come with this product. All of Brio's loads work well with this item, but for children the more loads the better!"
5,Once again showing a heart after God,"I always wait with great expectation when a new album comes out from SCC, and I have never been disappointed. And when this one came out, I was once again thrilled. Steven has a knock for opening his heart through his songs and share some of the intimate growth that he has experience throughout his life. And in the process, showing us all the heart of God. My favorite song on this album, 'What Now' will reach into your heart and challenge you to act on all the words you've ever spoken. This album is exceptional musically and lyrically and is worth listnening to again and again (as I have).And for those who have written that this is just another high volume album that 'just sounds the same', what have you been listening to? It hasn't been SCC."
3,Almost there,The product is functionally great but in true microsoft fashionYou will need to buy a new one every few months because the hat will break off and krazy glue will only hold it for a few weeksThis is a true microsoft product.
4,CD 2 is what you should be buying this album for!,"CD 1 of Fear of Flying is competent intelligent drum n bass, good but not great. While it uses some great instrumental samples, upbeat basslines, and nice vocals and breaks where it counts, it suffers from the indulgent monotony of most contemporary music of this genre, where it seems like the artist doesn't know how to end or ""climax"" a song. (3 stars for CD 1)However, CD 2 is definitely more interesting music, delving into dub stylings with a range of masterful toasters for the most part, along with some other fine midpace instrumental and female vocalist tracks. This bonus CD was a total surprise, and more than made up for the broken expectations of CD 1.CD 2 is worth the album price alone, as it's expressive of the production skills and range of this solid artist, and more stimulating music to listen to because of it. Maximum respect to the one like Big Bud!"
5,Pleased for different reasons,The book was in very good condition. It is also very easy to read. I bought this book because my Grand-daughter has gotten into geneology and has asked about family history. Dr. Fisher is my great-great uncle so it gave her a thrill to read about a famous relation especially when she found out through research that he was married to the also famous American Indian Princess Te Ata. The book was worth far more than I paid for it just for the pleasure and dreams it gave a young girl.
2,most useful cookbook??,"I bought this book largely because of the extensive hype it received in the New York Times. Now it's arrived, I'm disappointed. The book is organized around specific ingredients; once I take out those I can't face the thought of eating (brains, rabbit, liver, kidneys, sweetbreads, tripe) and those I'll never find (squab, smoked haddock, hake, cepes, grouse), there's not much of the book left. There are not very many recipes and quite a few of them cover familiar ground--olive oil mashed potatoes, lemon surprise pudding, roast leg of lamb, etc. I'm sure I'll find a few good ideas in here, but calling this ""the most useful cookbook of all time"" is a real stretch."
3,worked ok,worked ok was good cheap replacement hat to replace after 6 months because tip got loose and broke off cord. but for the price i'd buy it again
5,Works well,The product came quickly and was doing all that it said it would it was a great price and is prefect for whatI wanted. I would buy again.
3,Fit Well,"The gloves fit well and arrived in reasonable shipping time. Wish they were a little longer to cover the wrist as the picture shows. They barely reach the wrist. Will need to treat the finger ends with ""no frey"" to keep them from unraveling."
4,Not a Home & Garden book.,"Despite the title, Electric Sewer is NOT a book from Home & Gardens TV and will not in the least, inprove your home plumbing system. This is a down and dirty collection of day-to-day stories of street police work and the language used is real, just as it's used in the subways of New York and the streets of LA where I worked for 25 years. I thought I would have no problems with Nehoc's narrative but what the hell is a ""Perp""? We had ""suspects"". He made ""collars"", I made ""Arrests"". but once into the book I was hooked, because I would laugh and mumble ""Yep, been there, done that"". The book has its share of gallows humor that I found familiar, the mental self preservation of cops, firefighters, and EMTs. I especially recommend the book to new recruits to law enforcement, take a look at real street cops, chasing robbery suspects, (Oops,Perps), from train car to train car, hoping your fellow coppers will be at the next station to pick up your broken fanny.Robert teGroen."
3,Does the trick.,"My daughter was constantly getting her legs stuck between the crib rails. She has not done that once since we put this up. My only complaint would be that it moves and shifts and I have to constantly reset it. Bottomline is though, it gets the job done."
2,Not quite essential...,"The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons is definitely the least essential and worst of all of the guides. Instead of going into the culture and ecology of the planets like it should have, it simply tells us the story of whatever adventure our heroes had there. We get that from reading the novels! This book would have been so much neater if it had told us something at all about life on these planets.We don't even get a neat map of the planets -- instead, a tiny black and white globe that isn't helpful, with a 1""x3"" little inset map of the area we have heard most about in the books. Beneath that is a little illustration of a couple of people from that planet, most of them pretty bad and unhelpful. And then we get some more bad pictures of some native flora and fauna and some corny captions beneath them.This book is quite a waste of time and money!"
1,Microsoft hates its customers (but loves money).,"This lousy sports title looks like it will be the all time last original XBOX release. I bought my original shiny new XBOX and many new games one month after the xbox360 was released. I resisted buying this original XBOX because I just knew microsoft would find a way of taking my money and then screwing me. SURPRISE, they did just that. Only then did I learn that Microsoft would no longer in any way support the original XBOX and after giving to Microsoft my very hard earned dollars for all that stuff, I was now expected to throw it all out and give them more money for an xbox360. Oh, and then they might get around to backward compatability for a few titles at some point. I pray for the day Microsoft goes down in flames and I will NEVER buy an xbox360."
5,The Best Italian Cookbook Ever!,The absolute best Italian cookbook ever. I have tried most of the recipes and we loved them all. The Rice Sandwiches are to die for!!
5,best Italian cookbook!!,I love this cookbook! Every recipe I have made has been a hit. I am so disappointed to hear that the book is out of print. Publisher--please change this!
1,Note: This is IMAC-incompatible!,"If you want this product for your IMAC, be careful. There are appparently no longer DVD-ROM drives available for IMACs that don't already have them."
4,Playing With Roget,Great CD --the voice of Dani McGee stands among the ranks of leading classic rock female vocalists. Guitarist Doug Reese is awesome and offers a commanding & sexy performance in Rant --a must-hear track. Creative and intelligent writing --music & lyrics.
4,WHY,(As a cat lover) I wish my cat could look at this book. I am sure he would be entertained!! The enhancement of a beautiful animal is much appreciated. I love it when children look at this book. Their comments are wonderful.
3,"its ok, but wait for The Show","The graphics in 2k7 are the best of any baseball game yet. All the ballparks are detailed almost perfectly & most of the players hit & throw like they really do.However, the gameplay in this game is awful. Not only do the opposing players rob you of 2-3 home runs per game, but it is rediculously easy to win, and I prefer a challenging game. I am 12-1 in season mode so far, & I had one of my pitchers throw a no-hitter with 20 strikeouts. As you can tell by that last statement, the pitching in this game is way too easy.So, wait a few weeks, buy The Show, and have a fun baseball experience with what looks to be great graphics (at least from the previews)."
5,One Saxaphone Blitzing Heck of a CD !!,"This CD highlights the great saxaphone playing of two incredible masters Richie Cole and Phil Woods. You will also hear some cool playing from Eddie ""lockjaw"" Davis and vocals from Eddie Jefferson on one track. Warning! the music is not for those faint hearted mush types. A lot of fast pace riffs and hot cooking sounds. There are a couple mellow saxy solo numbers that will warm your soul. One fantastic compilation of performances from some top notch jazz giants. Belongs in every jazz lovers collecdtion."
5,The best,"Since her first cartoons in the New Yorker I have found Ms Chast to be absolutely in line with my own sense of the absurdities we find around us. Maybe it's generational, I find the same with Matt Groening and both the Simpsons and his other cartoons. A great book with an excellent chronological collection of some of her best."
4,We love it.,"We bought this for our son when he was 2 and he had it for several years. I mainly got this one b/c I hate the giant plastic carts out there for kids and I didn't want something taking up a bunch of space. Not to mention that this one was $8 at the Dollar General Store. It held up beautifully and my son played with it every day. He treats his toys nicely but he's still all boy and I was very impressed with this cheapo cart. No doubt that it's not super quality and I sure wouldn't pay $20 for it, but if you can find one cheaper it certainly served our purpose for a long time!"
1,Cheap piece of plastic,"I purchased this for my daughter hoping it would be a cart that would last, but the basket is made of separate plastic pieces that snap together and can't hold anything with weight! The wheel don't roll very well especially on carpet. The section where you would put a doll is cheap plastic as well and can only hold a very small stuffed animal. Spend a little more and get one of the metal carts!"
4,Fun toy for new walker,"My 17 month old son loves pushing this cart around the house. It helps him walk but it's not sturdy enough to ""rely"" on the cart for walking. There are no instructions for assembling the cart and the cart does not look exactly like the photo on the box, so assembly was a little tricky. Overall, the cart is very fun and enjoyable for our son."
4,Willow bending suplement.,"After reading and building some of the projects in Brian Cameron's book on making bent willow furniture the ""15 Easy Weekend Projects Using Freshly Cut Wood"" looks like a keeper. I'm really looking forward to getting out to the lake and cutting some more willow!"
4,Olde Salt Review,"A master book of sea stories, British version. If you like sea stories get an American group as well ""American Sea Writing"", Library of America. Lot's of truth from the Olde Salts."
5,memories,"This CD brings back memories from the old days, Love It!! How cool it is to listen to music!!"
4,"great pool, not so durable","This pool had it all for my 1 year old. It's shallow but large enough for mom or dad to sit in it also. It has a sunshade and is inflatable and therefore easy on the baby for crawling in and out. The only problem I had with this pool is that by the third time I inflated it, one of the seams on the sunshade split open. This was not a tear, nor was the pool being manipulate in a way that it would be forced open. This is strictly a manufacturer's lack of adhesive quality. The one saving grace is that I can cut off the sunshade if necessary and the pool can still be used. I do recommend this pool however, because all of the inflatable pools are bound to spring leaks. They're cheap. This pool is awesome, especially for only $25. It's adorable and makes a great ball pit too because it has 3 sides to contain the balls to some extent."
3,"Nice edition, but book is more of the same","I'm not sure that P. L. Travers' classic, ""Mary Poppins"" really needed a sequel. She is a beloved character whose crusty exterior hides a heart-of-magical-gold. This 2nd installment is more of the same...she takes the children on magical journeys where they meet amazing people/creatures, and then she denies it ever happened. Each chapter is a stand-alone tale, perfect for bedtime reading to a child. And, just like in the last book (upcoming spoiler!), she leaves again. As before, Travers does a nice job with the characterization, but it just seems repetitive and actually diminishes the special quality of the first book."
2,Well...,"Not the greatest of horror movies, MOTHER OF TEARS is entertaining enough for me to say that it is worth the rental fee, but not to buy. Asia Argento wasn't able to capture my attention like she normally does in her past films. Some of the villains look like Harry Potter rejects."
3,deminsion extreme is cut,"i have been looking at the reviews and i just want to let the diehard fans know the deminsion extreme dvd is cut wtf is up with people messing with the maestro,s visions?anyway,thats why i got a regionfree dvd player. they are not that expensive now.thats what i would recommend to the fans.thanks,david"
5,BEST CHOICE!,"I was never a Die Hard fan of The Stone Roses neither of the Monkey King, but I was always tempted to buy a CD of him as I really love his master piece ""I want to be adored"" with his former band and solo songs such as ""Love like a fountain"". Well, I was NOT dissapointed when I got this CD: Really cool tracks, nice selections and very good collaborations (Keep what ya' got - Noel Gallagher, F.E.A.R. - UNKLE and some others great tracks inside!). I could only say that this CD worth every dollar I spent and definitely I can recommend it to any fan or casual listener."
3,kid's left behind series,"My grandson is enjoying the kid's left behind series, it is Bible oriented and much easier for him to understand than the adult series."
2,Oscillator Works Poorly After Only A Year - No Mist,"Without going into a long diatribe, let's just say I'm not pleased.It worked wonderfully for one season - of which consisted of roughly 3 months use during the driest of winter months here in the Mid-Atlantic.I made sure the oscillator was cleaned of sediment and buildup every 3rd refill or as needed.The following season, the water would only burble with mist production at barely a wisp. Apparently this issue is not unique to the VS100. Several other Venta models with the ultra-sonic transducer experience the same issue after <1 year of use. When I saw ""Made in Korea"" I raised and eyebrow. Korean's aren't exactly known for robust and wonderful electronics or consumer products (Kia, Samsung phones, etc.). Add Venta to the list. Won't purchase again. You shouldn't either.Video of an issue similar to mine: [...]"
3,"Works well, Heat option really needed??","This humidifier works well and is pretty quiet. I don't think the warm 'heat' option really makes any difference. One the steam hits the air it cools off immediately and doesn't really add any heat to the air, so I personally don't think it's worth it.The humidistat (humidity knob) is almost worthless and the usable range is the first 1/2 inch of rotation. Any more than that and you will have your room at 70-80% humidity level and water dripping down your walls!It needs weekly cleaning, but that will depend on your water quality.It is pretty awkward to refill as it won't fit under my bathroom sink and I use the bath tub faucet to refill it since this is kept upstairs in the bedroom. It is hard to hold the unit upside down with one hand while it starts getting full and the top is not flat so you can't just set it down while filling.It's ok, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"Two Units, both didn't work after three weeks","My 2 year old has eczema and we have struggled to find a good humidifier. The VENTA SonicS100 looked ideal:cool and warm mist, Ultrasonic, filter. The only problem is, they both stopped producing mist after 3 weeks. The filter went after 2 weeks (at $15 a pop, this can become one expensive humidifier). When the filter goes, the water does not drain properly and the unit shuts itself off. I thought maybe I did something wrong with the first one so I was very disciplined in cleaning the metal part in the unit every night. It would still get covered with particles from the filter as well as hard chunks around the rubber. I returned and I am currently in search for a decent humidifier."
1,"Great at first, but then died!","This humidifier started out great, super quiet, lots of steam and fast! Fast forward one year later and it just died one day! Since it has been over 1 year by a couple of months it's no longer under warranty so I'm out of luck! The filters were also $$ to replace and needed to be changed every couple of weeks."
1,Awful peice of GARBAGE!!!,"I am sad that I can not give it zero stars. It is not worthy of even one. This humidifier worked fine for about one day. Then the agitator needed to be cleaned. With each additional use, it needed more and more cleaning, until it finally stopped working all together. PLEASE, do not buy this or any other product this company makes. They obviously do not care about the consumers, or their reputation, or they would have done SOME kind of testing on this model before releasing it for sale. The fact is, they know they are selling you a POS, and just don't care. Shame on Bed Bath and Beyond for selling such blantant junk in their stores."
2,Works great ... for about a day,"This ultrasonic humidifier worked well initially. Quickly produced vapor, quiet, and effectively raised humidity in room by 10%. The built-in humidistat worked well, and turned unit off appropriately. HOWEVER, the major flaw in this product is that it only worked for about a day. After that, I noticed that the unit stopped producing vapor no matter what I did, including manually filling the lower chambers with water. When I returned it, customer service actually told me most of their customers also were returning this unit, as they too had problems. So, do yourself a favor and stay away!"
1,Great machine when it works,"My girlfriend and I recently bought two ultrasonic humidfiers -- this machine and an Air-O-Swiss 7135. The Venta worked well when it worked. However, it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason. You could jiggle the thing, and it would go on and off. We finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base. The water wasn't flowing properly, and the machine stopped (as it should) because there was no water. Took it back to the hardware store where we bought it, and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem. It may be number 1 in Germany, but it gets only 1 star here."
1,Anger Management,"Like so many others before me, I too thought this would be the best humidifier - and it was! For about one week. To boot, this is my second one. The first one had the exact same problem - it ran perfectly for a week and then stopped producing any mist. I tried all the troubleshooting tips in the extremely detailed and helpful ""manual"". I assumed I had broken the very sensitive oscilator and that it was my fault, so like a fool, I purchased a second. HA! Same problem. It took a lot of self control on my part to restrain myself from picking the thing up and throwing it across the room - especially when you have a toddler who has chronic bronchial infections and you just want the darn thing to work. Here is my advice for anyone who has a broken one like me and has missed their window of opportunity to return it because they thought they could fix it:Step one - open trash can.Step two - hurl VENTASonic into it.Step three - slam lid on can."
2,Glad I didn't start with this book,"Glad I didn't start the MageWorlds with this book; it seems disjointed and vague, like the authors knew they wanted to write a book but didn't know where it should go. Especially sad was the authors' need to explain stuff beforehand in a preface. This book is OK for MageWorld fans but it sure doesn't have the same character magic the original books have."
5,Mageworlds series,"One of the best series of space operas/ syfy/ fantasy I have read. I have read all of the books so far and I hope the author will pen several more, so I can enjoy."
2,Extremely dull,"Unless you're in an economics course, I can't recommend this book. ( I should say I read Krugman's column in the New York Times weekly and usually agree with it. I also liked his new book, Conscience of a Liberal, very much). However, this book is extremely dull and there's nothing particularly incisive in it. Skip it and read one of his other books."
2,This is a Shame,"The first book of the ""Preludes"" trilogy, like the two that follow after it, should never have been allowed to be included in the Dragonlance Saga. I have read them all, and I really wanted to like this book, but it just wasn't happening. Sturm and Kitiara get together to seek out Sturm's father.... a promising enough start, but before you can say ""DUH"" they've ended up on Lunitari with a bunch of goofy gnomes and a whiny dragon. There is no development of either the Sturm or Kitiara character, and for those hoping to see seeds of little Steele twinkling in their eyes will be sorely disappointed. This is a poorly written novel, with minimal plot, and little to reccomend it to any but the most hard-core of DL fans. Do yourself a favor and pass this one bye and pick up the ""Preludes 2"" trilogy, a much stronger and more interesting set."
2,I got the Hot Yoga Blues!,"OK, should I be professional about this review? Were they professional about their ""yoga""? No. This is shameless eye candy with little to no educational value. Still, it doesn't exactly suck to look at it. The new age soundtrack and ""instructions"" that accompany the scantily-clad muscle boys in their alluring poses is too painful to endure.If you live in the Seattle area, try accompanying this DVD's visuals with 91.3FM's Friday night blues program. The yogawannabies and the old skool blues go together alarmingly well!"
5,This Book Deserves Six Stars,"For those serious about getting into a top MBA program, this book is GOLD.This writer provides terrific information and treats the reader as a partner. Most books of this type are so general that the practical utility is lessened. In this book, the topics that count are all there, and handled with detail and in many cases brilliantly. The writer uses humor to help you remember his points. An example from the chapter on resumes: ""You know your resume is ready when your mother looks at it and can't recognize who it is."" Buy this book and enjoy!"
2,Mostly Just Common Sense,"I've read this book and the previous version. While none of the advice is wrong or bad, I didn't feel like any of it was earth-shattering, either. Most of what's in here is common sense to someone who has a decent shot of getting into a top business school. It's a catchy title, and you may pick up a few tidibits, but I've found other books to be more useful. Also, this version is longer than the previous one, but the additional content doesn't seem to justify the high price."
3,Good shirts- then sudden price increase!,"First of all, these shirts are 100% linen, very good quality, made in China. I ordered two shirts, and I liked them so much I wanted to order two more right away. I soon realized that the price per shirt had gone up from the original $14.97 each, to $39.98 each now, about 265% of the original price.When I wrote Joseph A. Bank about this, I was told that the original price was an online promotional price only; this was something that was never mentioned when I originally purchased my shirts.Quality of the shirts: 5 StarsQuality of the misleading ad: 2 or three stars"
5,Classic 60's jazz,The 60's were a time of change. This album is an excellent example of the vibe that was happening in jazz. It moves away from big band and settles in to a groove that is soulful and easy on the ears.
2,Disappointed,I have read a selection of erotic fiction recently and was very disappointed with the short stories in this book - generally quite boring!
5,A GREAT book!,I really enjoyed this book -- especially how Chip helps Bobby Bollinger with basketball skills and in getting along with his older brother.I recommend this book to everyone.
2,"Nice looking, but poor in quallity","Bought these sticks because I am a big fan of Travis, but after playing only 1 show with them, one of the sticks became warped. It has a slight but significant curve to it now. I was very disappointed with this."
3,Funnier than anything!,"This is an author that makes those Jack Chick comics seem sane and lucid. There is not one cultural icon that escapes unscathed from Marr's psychotic paranoia.From Rainbow Brite to the Smurfs, popular culture is creating a Satan worshipping cult of New Age values. Every chapter begins with a nasty story that may or may not be true (3rd grade satan worshippers hitting their playmates with rocks, etc.) and then turns around and says that it is the media that is causing it all.Beautifully written, poetic, and scary on two fronts. One being that Marr takes himself seriously and second being that in the author bio, it states that someone hired this yahoo as a professor."
1,I Once Believed It... Now I'm Embarrassed,"I read this about 12 years ago when I was much younger and very trusting in anything the local Christian bookstore provided. I actually fell for the whole thing. I also fell for ""88 Reasons Why the Rapture will Happen in 1988"" at the same time. So you can imagine the paranoia I was going through (is that a fruit of the Spirit? Yeah, right...).Bottom line is: I was a clueless sheep, and there are many out there that still are. You have a right to read anything you want (including this stuff), but please use some discernment."
1,Hogwash,"I see yet another attempt to undermine the New Age movement.. In a world where a war is being waged by two religions, Islam and Christianity, both religions have the audacity to blame and criticize the beliefs of others. It's really amazing to me.I look at the world today and rather than seeing some New Age ""conspiracy"" to rule the world, I see a renewed crusade by the two Abrahamic religions in order to regauin perceived power lost. This book is just another attempt to keep people away from spiritual truth... ""Oh, it's the religion of the anti-Christ."" Really?The book of Revelation makes it quite apparent that the anti-Christ will be a Christian and viewed as someone to be admired.. It is just another example of why so many people dislike modern day Christians. The whole ""I'm right, your'e wrong"" ideology is not panning out too well for Christianity, in my opinion."
4,Believe This Is Good,"Jay Quinn has talent. His Voice goes along with the music in every song. The song 'I NEED"" is one of the best songs on this album. Even though its out of print you should go out and find it. Believe is a great album!!!!!!!"
2,definetly not permanant,"the original color was excellent, how ever, the product said it was permanant and after 3 washes the color was really faded and what was left was just a crummy brownish orange."
3,Ok,I found this resource ok. It is very basic and aimed at the traveller who wants to know how to meet and greet people in Cantonese. I found the lessons clear and easy to follow but also a little repetitive and not particularly inspiring.
4,Intense,"Completely in the dark re: most of his private life. This book is a good read, couldnt put it down. Heard of some of his run-ins with the press, didnt realize it was so wide-spread. All the other details were revealing of a troubled personal life, void of long term committements, etc.Good writing on the subject."
2,Golf net,Not a bad idea until I set it up. The wind blue it away several times. Instructions were very limited. The catch for the balls blows around in the wind. I missed the catch a couple of times and the ball went through the netting.I expected more for the money.
4,Remedy for those disillusioned with the record industry,"This cd shows the diversity and quality in the thriving underground synthpop scene. There are some cracking tunes here and something is bound to appeal to everyone. In particular I love the sound and the cynicism of macondo and eight to infinity, 2 to watch I think. Enjoy."
4,Why Rosy-Cross's review is incorrect?,"According to the book September 11th WAS not a good day for taking short journeys of any kind. Also, you do not HAVE to get the coin but if Rosy-Cross had it he would have seen that he was in error as to what kind of influences were in the time period of the morning of September 11th. For those of you who like to read your horoscopes this is a great addition to or substitute for that. I recommend it highly."
3,fine,"it's fine, some of them are not quite complete shape, I need to use very hard to put them in the barrel"
2,Not as good as the picture,Rather poor quality control. The pellets are just not the quality what is pictured. Some jam in my pistol which holds 8 pellets in each end of the clip.
3,Tight Fitting Pellets,Bought these pellets for my Crosman Titan GP Nitro Piston i was a bit dissapointed with the fitting of these pellets its a bit too tight you have to push it in the barrel with force...i use the crosman pointed and they fits perfectly so dont know if its the Premier with that fitting problem...so i wont be buying these Premier brand again.
4,Truly Magic,"With 25 classic tracks, this CD was a great buy for me. I didnt really listen to Magic Sam much but opened up to the idea with a recommendation from a friend and really enjoyed the album. They have good blues hits and are enjoyable to listen to."
5,Great Product for Science Fairs,"I purchased this product for my daughter's 5th grade science fair project on bacteria on restaurant menus. The directions were easy to follow and she was certainly able to do it on her own, with minimal parental supervision. I do agree with the other reviews that we were surprised at how long it took for the agar to liquify. We microwaved the agar bottle in 30 second intervals on low power. It took 4-5 minutes to liquify. We also, as some other reviews have said, had some chunky pieces that did not liquify. Maybe we should have microwaved it a bit longer, however, the pieces did not seem to affect the bacteria growth. Definitely put the petri dishes into plastic bags after swabbing as the directions say, as they smell very bad within a day or two.This product was a very good value- I priced similar products both locally and on the internet. It also came with everything we needed! I would definitely recommend it and would purchase it again myself."
1,Beautiful but Awful,"We bought the swing thinking it would look good in the house and it does. However, my son does not like it at all. The music is awful and doesn't have a turn off switch. You are stuck for 20 minutes listening to the music even if your child stays in it for 2 minutes. My son is very active and kicks the toy bar constantly and he will only sit in it for no more than 3 minutes. I thought he just didn't like swings in general but a friend has another kind and he sat in it for 30 minutes and then drifted off to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this swing unless you just want to look at it."
3,Swings Way Too Fast,"My husband put the swing together last night, we were shocked to find that the swing goes entirely too fast, just as another person stated, even on the slowest speed. We will wait until the baby arrives to see if maybe her weight will slow it down, if not, it will have to go back. It swings so fast, I would imagine it might make the baby throw up! Another issue is there is no option to turn the music off, once you turn it on, you have to wait 15 minutes for it to go off...pretty silly! Everything that looks good doesn't always work good."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this junk heep because of good reviews. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to take it back twice because the motor stops working after approx 1 month. I am returning my third one today!!!!!! What a joke!!!!! I just hope my Eddie Bauer highchair doesn't collapse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sincerely Dissapointed!!!!!!!!!J. Guerra
2,Hate this swing!!,"This swing sucks! My son hates it now that he is 3 months mainly because it doesn't recline enough. He still sits up and it just isn't comfy. I disagree with the other people who said its too fast - now that Gavin is 12.5 lbs, the fastest setting isn't fast enough because he weighs it down. The only reason we bought this swing was because it matched our living room! New moms, go for what works well no matter how ugly or mismatched it looks!"
2,Hot Male Yoga,I am very disappointed with this purchase. I knew it would be more of an erotic video that an actual instructional video when I ordered it. 10 minutes into my first viewing I realized the only value this DVD has is of an erotic purpose. Totally useless for yoga. If you want an actual instructional video look elsewhere.
5,In my opinion - Outstanding,"I am surprised no one else has reviewed this excellent Schubert CD.The playing and recording of these particular two symphonies is outstanding, and I have a number of the most popular versions of them to compare, as I am a huge Schubert fan. The music itself is excellent Schubert - and sometimes I play this CD for long periods of time on end - I enjoy it so much.Norrington has also recorded other Schubert symphonies, but this one stands out as of highest quality."
4,Hooray for Sondheim!!!,"This book is amazing. It has almost everything that you could want in a book like this. What does it include do you ask? WELL! It includes the scripts to A Funny Thing happened on the way to the Forum, A Little Night Music, Sweeney Tood, and Sunday in the Park With George. In addition to that it also has Original Hirschfeld drawings, Lyrics to cut songs and where they would go in the script, Costume Designs, Production Photos, Cast Lists from Original, Touring and Revival Casts, and also the discography for each of the shows. My only question... Where is volume two??? I would like to see the following shows put into a collaborative edition like this: Into the Woods, Assassins, Company and Follies. WOOO Amazing and entertaining. Recommend this to all musical lovers everywhere!"
4,Should have been better,"I wish I could be as positive as the other reviewers, but I have some problems with this recording. Gorgeous though her voice is, I think Norman is miscast. It's interesting to hear her in something other than her more usual Mozart/Strauss/Wagner repetoire, and she does sing well, but for some reason just sounds out of place. My main problem, however, is with Caballe. This is not a particularly difficult role, or at least shouldn't be for someone accustomed to singing Norma, Puritani, etc. But here Caballe sounds tentative and awkward some of the time. And her lack of a real high range (at least at volume) is noticeable here also. However, Gardelli couldn't have conducted a bad Verdi performance if he tried, and the male roles are all just fine. If you like this opera, and I do, you'll want this performance (not that you have a lot of other choices)."
2,Throw-Away,"My expectations for this movie were not high, yet I was still disappointed. ""The Promotion"" had elements in its favor: John C. Reilly, for one...too bad I can't think of any others at the moment.To be fair, I only got 40 minutes into the movie; I didn't watch it to the end. I'm still twerked that I wasted that much time on this dog, and I'd like my 40 minutes back. Try ""How to Get Ahead in Advertising"" or ""Swimming with Sharks"" instead."
2,"Some good laughs, but not many","The Promotion is a comedy set in Chicago featuring two guys fighting it out over a retail promotion.There are some genuinely funny moments in the film, but these seemed to be few and far between. There's some swearing in the film which I feel is totally unnecessary to the plot and further spoils the film.Good to see bits of Chicago in the film and a couple of brief appearances from actor Bobby Cannavale.All in all, watch it if there's nothing else, but don't expect to be amazed."
3,"First half funny, second half not","This one starts off very nicely and is quite funny for about half an hour or so. Then it cruises. Then it almost grinds to a halt as it attempts to moralize about this and that, never to the benefit of the film or the atmosphere set up early on. The ending is especially way out of whack...suddenly we're watching a promo for Corporate Success Through Clean Living?Scott and Reilly are both good and even quietly hilarious at moments but writer/director Conrad seems to have set it all up just so he could preach family values, or something--it wasn't too clear--by the end.We laughed, we guffawed, we sat silently, we exchanged confused glances, we sighed, we yawned, we shook our heads in disappointment.But those first 30 minutes are worth watching. After that, caveat viewor."
3,Repetitive,"Given the diversity of the jazz scene in Seattle, this album promses a lot: a review of everything you can hear in Seattle in all its variety.What you get instead, though, are many, many cuts which sound mostly alike. When you create a collection with such an ambitious title, you create a lot of expectations. This album does not meet those expectations..."
5,Real op ivy fans try to find this,i got my hands on one this month. 31 minutes of unreleased material from your favorite band kicks ass. I have listened to every song in a row just liek energy. Get energy if you dont have it then try to find this.
5,Documented History,"This is an excellent review of the events that occurred during the spring and fall of 1918 and the subsequent efforts to find out how and why the flu was so devastating. 280 out of every 1000 people got the flu and 40% of those died. A frightening number but if that number is compared to Autism it would be 16.8 of 150 (died of the virus) where Autism would be 1 of 150 (children having the condition). An unfair comparison but the numbers give a modern day perspective on the Flu.On the whole, a great documentation of history and a limited view of what to expect with the next flu pandemic, which if the 11 year cycle is accurate, will happen in 2012."
3,NOT about the 1918 epidemic,I wanted to read the story of the 1918 flu--surprise! There is hardly anything about it in this book. Most of the book is about the virus hunters. Sort of interesting but I wanted to learn more about the actual epidemic which took several wonderful family members.
2,Pop history,"There is very little original research and not a highly academic endeavor. However, it is an easy read and may prove a good place to start for hobby epidemioloical history enthusiasts. From a scientific perspective, this may be the topic of the season, but it is still too soon to report on the research of epidemiologists working to unravel all of the pandemic's idiosyncracies."
4,Excellent scary science - buy it for a sick friend!,"I read this book while getting over a case of the flu - and would recommend almost anyone do the same. Like many popular science books, it's a trifle dry, especially in dealing with the time after the influenza epidemic, when quite frankly science plods along looking for the cure, or even the identity of the 1918 flu.But that said, it's a good read, and you'll be as shocked as I was to learn about the modern day plauge that could have wiped out even more of the nation than it did."
3,Half the title is a misnomer; a superficial account at best,"While this book was hardly a complete waste of time, it was also a great disappointment. It was decidedly not an account of ""The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918."" (Since I finished this book, I have begun Alfred Crosby's ""America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918,"" a far superior account of what actually happened in 1918-19.) Even where this book has some strength--in recounting the story of several post-1918 attempts to discover the original virus that caused the 1918 outbreak--it seems to be written in a rather shallow, journalistic style. The book shows all the signs of having been hastily prepared for the mass market. One would have expected better from a science writer from the New York Times, but perhaps her acumen as a writer has been warped by the nature of the beat she covers (e.g., cloning)."
3,Haaaa-chu!,"A marginally interesting tome that would be better as a 10 page article. The work is in dire need of a good editor (eg pg 38 ""it was not until 1900-the first time since cities came into existence five thousand years earlier-that large cities could maintain their populations without constant influxes of immegrants"" vs pg47 ""By the dawn of the twentieth centery, for the first time since cities had come into existence 5,000 years before, infectious diseases were staunched to such an extend that cities were able to remain stable, and even grow, without depending on a constant stream of migrants..."") The book also wrestles with contradictory premises: that the great pandemic is all but forgotten, however its searing memory spawned knee-jerk rections in the US during the 70's Swine Flu debacle and Hong Kong's recent chicken massacre? The story _is_ interesting, but the 'filer' (long tangential discussions) and the constant appearance of 'august' scientists made for a dull read."
1,"poorly organized, mediocre writing","As I writer myself I'll say 3 things about this book. One, it's poorly organized. It's clear she tacked on chapter after chapter at the end after discovering new material. Two, the writing is at best mediocre. And three, I read it to the end anyway. You'll learn a lot about epidemics and nasty flu bugs. But I have to wonder if the ""other"" book about the 1918 Pandemic isn't better written. And if you want a REAL read, get Ken Alibek's ""Biohazard."" The vaccine-resistant smallpox developed in the former USSR is a lot more likely to kill you, or keep you up at night worrying, than even the worst influenza outbreak - or book."
2,The worst kind of science writing,"There's about half a book on the influenza epidemic of 1918 here, the rest is cluttered up with meaningless information--the names of peoples' children, the colors of their eyes, the kinds of cars they drive, etc--who cares. This book could have used some serious editing. The history is cursory--there's actually very little described about the epidemic and its immediate and long term aftermath. The narrative is cluttered; the story moves along and then detours to describe the most irrelevant facts. The science is fairly light-weight, and not especially elucidating--you will learn very few facts about the flu in this book."
3,"Riveting, but could have been so much better","I've been fascinated by this flu since I read Malcolm Gladwell's article in the New Yorker. When I heard about this book, I hoped that he had written it. Alas. Kolata has done a good job producing a page turner, and she handily explains a lot of scientific information, but the story could have been woven together in a much more compelling way. Plus, some of the material, such as the extensive chapter on litigation, felt tangental. I was fascinated by the fact that Hultin had gone back to Alaska and successfully removed tissue while the Duncan team, to great fanfare, failed. I hadn't read about Hultin's success the way I read about the Duncan hype (in the media). That story could have been told better by Kolata, I thought. Not to put the book down....I really enjoyed reading it. But it could have been great."
4,flu,Good book. This was a great purchase for the quality and the price. I would definately recommend this item to anyone to buy.
3,Doesn't stick well on computer,This product didn't stick well to my computer; it was constantly falling off. I would have to buy a think double sided-tape in order to have it stick on the side of my computer. But it does hold up paper.
5,Wonderful new perspective on libraries,Madeleine Lefebvre has put libraries in a whole new light in this wonderfully entertaining collection. Library lovers everywhere should own this book. Story telling at its best.
4,"Compared To Krautrock, Soul Jazz, and Post Rock","On paper it seems strange for the psychedelic jazz band MUSHROOM to hook up with punk blues singer Gary Floyd of Sister Double Happiness. But these guys do a super groove version of the Les McCann/Eddie Harris hit Compared To What. Some hot trumpet playing c/o of Jon Birdsong who has spent the past 3 years playing with Beck. And Michael Bluestein does some wicked piano playing and analog synth - that gives the song sort of a space rock overtone. The rest of the CD is all instrumental that is in 1970's Krautrock meets soul jazz vibe and includes a REMIX by Krautrock legends FAUST and one by Tortoise/Gastr del Sol man Bundy K Brown. The Bundy K Brown mix sounds like a mix of electronica and early Pink Floyd. very trippy and weird and is about 20 mins long ! overall a great CD for jamming, tripping and dancing."
4,Jazz For A Rainy Afternoon CD.,I received the product when I was told that I would and it was in great shape. Great service.
1,"Warms the water nicely, but that is it.",Tried to clean just three tarnished silver 1-oz bars with this Ultrasonic Cleaner. It buzzes really well. Warms the water just fine. But that is it. Even added the specified jeweler cleaner. A few bubbles formed. Tried no less than EIGHT full length cycles. Don't waste your money.
5,Excellent Read!,"Clegg is one of my favorite authors and his latest is one of his best! YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU is on par with THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, which is by far my favorite Clegg title. YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU is fast paced and populated with those quirky characters about which Clegg writes. A MUST BUY for all horror and suspense fans!"
2,just eye candy,I bought this but returned it for the Carolina's monthby month book. This book is nice to look at but notas helpful as the other.
4,Larger than I expected.,"Seems to be well constructed, however, it is larger than I expected, guess I misjudged the ""1 qt. size"". I have had similar slightly smaller hand held paint pails that were more in the 2/3 to 3/4 qt size and they were much handier than this one. Still, it is functional and very well made."
4,"Their best effort,a classicrock mix,with hints of fusionprog","This is a simple album, without any peak or other strange music invention;neverthless 8 tracks are well represented by some stunning instrumentals, thanks to a good rythmical section supporting the job of the guitars and the keyboards too, in an excellent crescendo!! There are not amazing solos, magniloquent atmospheres nor great lessons, regarding of the harmonic solutions, but the output is tasteful, by means of the elegant choice of the sounds and a convincing energy in the execution as well !! The jazz background of Alain Chiarazzo has been never dominant,yet it's present here and the result is excellent (I can not make the same considerations, talking about their previous work...). It's a good album, with some important breaks through during the instrumentals, and the support of spare parts at the violin!!One of the best last recent prog issues from France ..."
1,Not what it says it is,"This product died my hair red, and not purple, as advertised. I have light brown hair, so if your hair color is similar, stay away from this product, unless you want Ronald McDonald red."
3,washes out fast,Well it did change my color. I didn't bleach it out which I wish that I had because it didn't show up purple at all on my reddish brown hair. It just made my hair look dark brown. It also washed out in weeks and now my hair is a funky fake red color which I really hate. I would say bleach first but don't expect it to stay in for long.
4,Sonique- u make me feel so high!,"Most dance songs are so boring u almost fall alseep, always the same rythm, mostly covered or almost covered froma song u heard before. Not so Sonique's ""It feels so good"". My god, this lady has party-feeling! First of all, I adore her voice. It sounds so pleasant to me and also her capability of singing so extremely low (but still so warm) and then goin so high(but also still warm) is great! Everything is so harmonious. Like a fairytale, and I don't exaggerate... I didn't hear her album yet, but I'll surely do that soon. Check out Sonique and u gonna fly... :)"
2,Brief,"I have some knowledge of Roman history, so this book fell a bit short. If you are looking for a quick overview, it is probably OK. However, on several points I questioned it factual accuracy. For example, the Cicero I have read about lived in the first century BC, not the first century AD. Since this correspond with the transition between Republican and Imperial Rome, this distinction is critical."
3,Not as complete as expected,This legal dictionary is not as good and complete as promised. Although it was helpful it lacks many basic terms and interpretations specially for the business-commercial arena. I'd say it's probably more specific for court interpreters that deal with criminal law.
3,Chick Book-okay quick read-but ending was a letdown,"The book was an easy read, a ""hey I can relate tothat"" kind of book-but the end left me hanging-I wanted something a little more spicy to happen."
2,Dialogue not believable,"I have read everything by Maeve Binchy and was disappointed in Tara Road for several reasons. It is indeed an easy read but I found the plot too predictable (ie. I was just waiting to find out when Danny would leave Ria). All the hints were too obvious as to the outcome of the plot. I also was quite disappointed that the American dialogue was not researched. The American kids spoke like very well-schooled Irish children and one of the first things that Marilyn said was, ""I'll ring you later."""
4,Love and Loss in Dublin,"I found the characters in this novel very interesting as usual. The character of Danny Lynch is rather confusing. I alway wonder why is he so different from his parents? I despised him for being such a philanderer, but at times it seemed that he still loved his wife. I find it hard to believe that Ria could be so naive and unsuspecting of her husband's true character.I think Gertie Brennan,the wife in an abusive marriage, was very true to life-always standing up for her husband in spite of her beatings. I would like to see her find a worthy husband after Jack's death.However,Rosemary, the beautiful career woman does not seem quite real or dimensional.The plot is enjoyable and compelling.I think in some ways that Glass Lake is a better book. I also reccommend the book of short stories, Victoria Line, Central Line,great characters!"
3,Pure Maeve Binchy,"Having read Maeve Binchy before, Tara Road is neither more nor less satisfying than any of her other books. The same concept and writing style is there. Binchy writes in a style that most non - British find amusing. Some of the phrases that come out of her characters mouths are so quaint you can't help but laugh. As the book goes on you get used to it though. And they're hard books to put down, Tara Road included. Binchy creates a number of characters and then weaves their stories together. Its almost like sitting down and gossiping with your friends. I'm not sure how Binchy would stack up against James Joyce, and her characters can sometimes be stereotypical, but Tara Road is good to just sit down and get straight into."
1,HUH??,Where's the climax?! Where's the excitement?!Way too long and draggy. A waste of my time. Totally.
2,Publisher must have needed a new title in a hurry,"When Maeve's novels are amongst one's ""guilty pleasures,"" one is quite accustomed to plowing through certain tedious sections, knowing they tend to have relevance, in unexpected ways, later. In this case, the wading is constant, and only literary quicksand ahead.Maeve often is brilliant in her characterisation, dialogue, and depiction of relationships. Not so here - the plot, such as it is, seems to go nowhere at all, and such relationships as are not totally contrived are far too puzzling."
3,"Should Be On the ""Sale"" Table","Not worth the cost of the book. The idea of two women switching houses was good, but the charaters were weak. The cover sounded better than the book was. The character's lacked the courage to be honest with each other."
5,"If you've never read Binchy before, start with this one!","I fell victim to all the bookstores displaying this latest book by Maeve Binchy, when in Ireland last fall and was immediately hooked. Binchy has an incredible talent for describing people and their everyday lives, as well as their surroundings, giving you the impression, you know exactly, what Tara Road looks like and who lives where. As if you had been there yourself. It is written in such an easy and flowing language that I could not put this book aside and only started breathing again, after I had finished it. I've read other works of hers since, but Tara Road is still the best!"
2,I kept waiting for it to move somewhere...,"...and it never quite did so.Those fond of the old cliche that a change of scene is the best thing on earth may find it forgivable that this tale is rather tiresome. The two major characters (one heartbroken because of her husband's departure, the other because of a child's death) are never quite developed, and the twists in the plot that seem to promise added depth lead to nothing.Maeve's forte in her best work is character development and relationships of all sorts. Tara Road reminded me more of conversations one may hear in a launderette such as character Gertie manages."
4,True life at its best...or worst...,"I won't lie, I randomly found this book at work and only picked it up and started reading it because it had my name in the title. Once I started it, though, I couldn't put it down! Ms. Binchy's characters are realistic, as are their struggles. They are not all gorgeous people who are honorable and trustworthy--they have their share of faults, which gives this novel a wonderfully human quality. There were some parts that dragged along more than others, but all in all, I was impressed."
4,Another excellent book by Maeve Binchy.,"With Binchy's books, I never want them to end and Tara Road was no exception. The characters are so well drawn that they are old friends by the time you are half way through the book. There was a lot of realism in this story and the relationships ring true. Ria was a great character and so was her daughter. You could see her daughter's growth throughout the book. I wish that there weren't so many years between Binchy's books. They are always a rare treat."
5,What a Trip!,"I have always wanted to go to Ireland, having been born a Murphy. Now I think I have. I visited a fascinating family, hung around the local pub for all the blab, helped sort out some problems, and then came home, enriched. This is my first Binchy but will not be my last. Strange, I could hear my dearly departed Irish relatives loud and clear."
1,Tara Road - I'll Stay Home,"While novels may require you to suspend belief, this one goes way too far. The characters were totally unbelievable. There are too many ""stories within the story"" and no time is spent to really ""flesh-out"" any of the characters."
1,I couldn't even finish it,This book was SO boring. I borrowed the book from a friend since I was flying back and had nothing to read - what a mistake. I read during the entire flight and was so bored that I tried sleeping. Once I was home I tried to get through it and finally skipped to the last couple of chapters and amazingly knew what was going on. I have never read Maeve Bincy before and it's doubtful I will again. I love reading but this one just didn't do it for me.
4,"Not as good as Evening Class, but worth reading","Having enjoyed Evening Class, I looked forward to this novel. It started out well, the characters were well developed, and the relationships between the characters were described quite well. I can't pin down exactly when the story started to slide down, but it almost lost me when it was revealed that the husband was having his affaire. I stuck with it, and despite its weaknesses, enjoyed the tale to the end."
2,"Easy, rather dull, read","I wasn't very impressed with this book. I felt that the first 200 pgs were quite boring. I wanted to shake Ria and wake her from her dream world. When she finally realizes her life isn't as wonderful as she thinks it is, things become a little more interesting. Ria's weak character annoyed me. I believe at the end of the story she still would have taken Danny back. I enjoyed how Marilyn's character grew and her interaction with Ria's friends was fun to read. I have 2 questions. 1) Who did Annie see Rosemarie with that afternoon? Did she recognize him or was she mainly shocked by the sexual scene? 2)Do you think Ria will end up with Colm? I do. Unless Danny were to show up at her doorstep."
1,Tara Road,"I found the book to be completely tedious. After trying desperately to get ""into"" the book, hope sprung eternal for me that something good had to happen in the 500+ pages. However, by the end, I remained completely disappointed. Binchy elevates the Ria character to sainthood while condemning the American, Marilyn, to the role of a cold and distant witch. The constant reminders of all Ria's abilities wore really thin. This has been my first and last Binchy book."
2,"Circle of Friends, this is not...","If I had been asked to rate this book when I had read just the first 200 pages, I would have given it one star. However, I had nothing else to read at the time so I continued to read it. At that early stage the book seemed poorly written and terribly dull. I couldn't fathom why Oprah chose it for her book club. The story picked up for me over half way through and by the end I couldn't put it down. Once I was finished I could begin to understand why Oprah chose it, but I'm still surprised that the book was published without some major editing. If I recommend it to anyone I will be sure to provide a list of the characters and tell the reader to begin reading after the first two hundred pages. This is not Ms. Bincheys best, by far."
2,not worthy of Oprah,"Having read some of Maeve Binchy's earlier books, I was surprised that Oprah would choose one; having read this book, I'm even more surprised. This was a fluffy, mildly entertaining book with plot developments which could be seen a mile away (did anyone not know who rosemary's lover was the entire time?). The lack of attention to detail was annoying (Americans do not use the phrase ""have a lie-down"" to take a nap, a 16 year old boy would not look in the refrigerator and comment on the ""lovely quiche"". The editor should have caught these.) Not bad for a beach read, but not worthy of discussion."
3,Tara Road,"This book was a bit slow to get to the point, however, it was enlightening by the end. Message I received from the read: You can't live your life for your spouse and kids alone. You can't lose sight of yourself. This is so true!!"
4,My Millenium Book - by lucky chance,"On my way back from a wonderful family Christmas in Washinton DC I bought a couple of books at Dulles Airport to fill in the long flight to Denmark - and the following jetlag days.Tara Road is my first, but definately not last Maeve Binchy book. Through two days and nights I laughed,cried and enjoyed these Irish - American everyday characters. Tara Road could quite well be a small road in Denmark, as well - and the Irish characters are quite similar to Danish everyday people. I hope to find a new MB book soon."
3,"Fun Characters, but too long!","Tara Road was an insightful narration of how life can change quickly (especially if you are an at-home mom). Ria, the main character and at-home mom, was warm friendly. She is the type of friend and/or neighbor all of us would like to have--non-judgemental.Maeve Binchy described the everyday life of these everyday people. They became acquaintances while I read the book. However, like people you meet briefly, this book can be easily forgotten. I think if the book was shorter (not 500 pages), I would have given this book a higher rating. It was too long to spend learning all the details of the many characters' lives."
5,"Utterly compelling, I could not put it down.",Maeve Binchy has made me fall in love with Ireland. Her characters are so well developed; her story lines so interesting and her writing style is magnificent. Each time I read one of her books I enjoy it more. TARA ROAD is no different. The characters could be us or our friends or neighbors dealing with problems that are so prevalent in our society: financial; infidelity; alcoholism. A great read with noteworthy characters most of whom will remind you of yourself or someone you know. Don't miss it!
1,I just can't get into it!,"I've never read this author's books before and usually won't even try a book that Oprah has recommended as I'm a total ""book snob"" and like to depend on ONLY my choices.Someone I met raved about this so I thought...why not? Time for something different from my real love which are mysteries. Wish I had depended on my first instinct and just not bought it! Glad I only purchased the paperback. I will keep it around and ""keep at it"" every now and then when I've nothing better to read/do but frankly, I'm bored to death early on."
3,A bit boring and predictable,It started out rather slow and tedious. The extensive details did lead to good character development. It just took too long to get to the meat of the story with numerous character introductions. Overall it was a a decent casual read just nothing exciting.
5,Surprisingly Good,"This game was surprisingly good, although it was cheaper than mlb 07 and the bigs.In the UK, as I am, you don't get great sports games like baseball and american football.So it is really good fun at first, but when you master it, it gets a little less fun.Overall though, great !!"
4,Underdog gets no respect!,"Perhaps the only offering from ARS yet to find a home on CD (as of this writing), UNDERDOG was the last of 'the golden years' for the Southern rockers who brought us such memorable hits as 'So Into You' and 'Imaginary Lover.' UNDERDOG (1979) boasted two charting singles - 'Do It or Die' and 'Spooky.' Both found lots of airplay on late 70's radio stations. The lineup for UD consisted of Barry Bailey, J.R. Cobb, Paul Goddard, Dean Daughtry, Robert Nix and Ronnie Hammond - TRACK LISTING - DO IT OR DIE - BORN READY - I HATE THE BLUES/LET'S GO GET STONED - INDIGO PASSION - WHILE TIME IS LEFT - IT'S ONLY MUSIC - SPOOKY - MY SONG."
2,The Relationships Behind the Feud,"I am a big Ann Rinaldi fan. My favorite is Girl in Blue. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into this book. Being thee feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys I expected more action and suspense. This novel was more centered on relationships and emotional and daily struggles. Not one of Ann Rinaldi's best books. I can't see a boy finishing this book. I think the interesting subject matter could have been presented in a more engaging way. However, her characters felt real and were well developed as always."
2,Reader in Illinois,"I just read the first three books in the series and had a hard time getting through the third. I was just plain bored. Don't think I will pay for a fourth, fifth, sixt etc."
2,huh?? I don't get it....,"I really don't see what is so great about this toy. The ring that holds it together in the center makes it so that you cannot move anything. They might have put the ring there because it is for a baby and it has to be a safe toy. But, then that defeats the purpose of the toy. I suggest getting one of the adult tangles to let your baby play with and then just supervise."
4,Great,"Although I had to return these to the seller because i found out they are illegal in Pennsylvania, they were very cool when i did have them. They Came just as described and it was painful having to send them back :( ."
2,way too small,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this and I should have listened. Most of them said how small it was and they were right. I bought a Canon Rebel and the camera would not fit in the bag. I had to return it. Nothing against the quality, just the size. If you have a real small digital camera it would work. Anything bigger than that, forget it."
2,CSP,"Though it accomodates my Casio Exilim camera, it looks cheap. It does not have good/aristocratic looks."
2,"annoying, to say the least..","this was the most predictible, ridiculous romance i have ever read. first of all, the main character, Sara, is clueless. about everything. she has no common sense, and isn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. this makes you just want to shake her the entire time you're reading. second, the main male character isn't much better. at least he has a brain in his head. and third, predictible..don't waste your money on this book."
1,Did Julie Garwood write this book????,"First of all, I have read almost all of Julie Garwood's books and loved them all. I was really looking forward to Nathan's story. How he could fall in love with Sara is a mystery to me. She was a total blockhead.I skipped alot of pages because Sara's behavior was so absolutely ridiculous. The book was awful.The only reason to read ""The Gift"" is because it is part of a series that starts with ""The Lion's Lady"". For me, ""The Gift"" was a BIG disappointment."
2,Didn't use this cd,"I purchased this cd after reading some of the positive reviews and it was not what I expected. There is a woman talking over some chanting. I didn't realize that a woman with a sultry voice was going to be talking throughout the cd, it was very distracting. I only made it to the first nine minutes, because the cd was skipping so badly that I couldn't play it anymore. I received it a week before I had my baby (she was a week early) so I didn't even take it with me to the hospital. Save your money."
4,Comparison of one great ego & one despirate drive to survive,"Great comparison, of two great men. One of which was driven buy his ego. Perfect exsample of how the white man delt w/ the people that helped them survive in a new land. The more thiings change the more they stay the same"
5,One of Ambrose best...,"I really enjoyed this book, the narrative really pulls one in and it was as enjoyable as the best fiction adventure. Ambrose has written several best sellers however I think this is one of his best works. He really put time into understanding the Indian culture and fairly presented the both the cultures, and attitudes of the day with balance. Worth reading!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Clearly, this book is not Ambrose's finest work. It added nothing new to the library of books written about these two characters; rather, Ambrose's portrayal was fatalistic, over-romanticized, unrealistic, and in places, inaccurate. If you are looking for information about Custer, Crazy Horse, and the Little Bighorn, there are much better sources.I've given the book two stars, but only because Ambrose deserves the benefit of the doubt -- this was one of his earlier works and his later titles, including ""Undaunted Courage"", ""Band of Brothers"", and ""D-Day"" are excellent."
3,Entertaining but not accurate,This is an entertaing read but hardly an accurate portrayal of Custer or the Sioux. It suffers from the same embellishments and fabrications as some other Ambrose works.It also is poorly translated into an electronic version.
3,Singing Songs,"Light reading, but has some powerful emotions that you are drawn into as you see what the writer has had to deal with. Emotions that we have all had to deal with in some form or another with either ourselves or someone whom we know and love."
3,Disappointed,"I am a little disappointed about this cd because they could have put better songs on this album. Songs like ""First time"" are not even on the cd. They could have kept some of the songs off. I just think they could picked a better selection."
1,Sporting Comedy,"I bought this book because I thought I would like to read some comedy. I am not a reader but this book came highly recommended on a radio station I listen too.Well I found this book not funny, vulger, obscene and illogical. It did not have a chronological order. It fell so far below disappointing I cannot even express it."
2,Not as good as it could be!,"If you like having color plates in your field guide this one is not for you. I found it difficult to work with and hard to find information I needed. For a field guide it has too much written information looking to list various tees but not enough total tree information. For instance, the buds and leaves are shown but not the tree bark or the silhouettes with each. Silhouettes are provided for types but not referenced for the various species. One has to jump around with the guide looking for information on the same specie of tree. For identifying species in the field the book falls far short. Color plates are a limited number of diagrams and sketches instead of photos, a major weakness. On a positive note, greater emphasis in locating species with maps showing growth locations is provided."
3,Not easy to use,"this isn't that easy to use-- hard to find a specific tree in the book. I've seen other books elsewhere that are useful, and plan to pick something else up. The 'plates' are pretty lousy and outdated as well. Most illustrations still leave you questioning whether (or not) you actually are looking at the tree you just think you identified. Photographs would be a much added benefit to the sketches and plates in this sense.I use other field guides, particularly for birding and insect identification, so I know it's not just me... spend your money elsewhere."
1,The worse Phone,"This phone was nothing but trouble.It continually stopped working causing me to have no phone service. I called my phone service and they came up and determined that the problem was in the phone,so I hooked up my old phone and everything was fine with my service. I would not reccomend this model phone to anyone,even though it's a Uniden."
5,A WILD 65 MINUTE DANCE PARTY,"Great sexy raps over some cold beats, reminds me of the pleasures hip-hop left behind."
2,Disappointment,"I was excited when I first purchased this book. I really enjoy designing my own knit paatterns and thought this would be very helpful as a starting point.My biggest complaint is that it doesn't really allow for customizing projects. I have shorter arms than are called for in na typical sweater pattern and need to shorten the sleeves. That type of adjustment is not included in the book. So if you are not a ""perfect"" 34, the seater you knit won't fit right.I'm not sure that the yardage amounts are coorect - might be on the short side. I always seemed to run out of yarn for projects even though I purchased more than enough for any other pattern of that type.If you want to create and design sweaters, I would recommend sweater deisng software rather than this book."
5,Excellent book of Sweater Knitting Patterns,"If you want to make your own sweater design, this book provides great charts and references on how to go beyond the stockinette stitch. Pictures of the sweaters also complement the instructions. You can make sweaters for everyone - babies, children, men, and women. Instructions are included on how to measure gauge, calculating yarn, sweater measurements, etc. Six different types of sweaters are included - drop shoulder, modified drop shoulder, set-in sleeve, saddle shoulder, raglan and seamless yoke. Personal touches are also included such as different neck finishes. I am a beginning knitter but I know this is one book that I can use as I expand my skills. Also, adjusting body or sleeve length, adding stitch or color patterns, and adjusting for different gauges are included. A great basic reference!"
2,john who?,"This book defeats itself. Its description of America's imperial stretch is extremely tame. His analysis is overly deceitful. Twice in this book, Mr. Newhouse has claimed that the Iraqi liberation has ended. I suppose your thoughts can be scuttled when you rely heavily on what Chalmers Johnson considers the ""establishment press- the Washington post, the new York times, or the los angeles times.""Although the book is a botched attempt at capturing historical fact, his brief interlude into North Korea's talks with president Clinton toward HEU reduction, and missile disarmament is interesting, nothing in this book is thought provoking in the manner in which it is intended.Who decided to print this book? Mr. Newhouse, don't read your daily paper. It will only infect your mind with trivial matters that are not newsworthy at all."
5,magnificent study of spiritual torture,"I LOVE this book. Being a former Christian Scientist myself, I've suffered the tortures of the damned thanks to Mary Baker Eddy. The book Simmons writes should be required reading for all recovering ex-Christian Scientists.The only thing I would like to have seen more of is a more detailed picture of Simmons' father. It would help the reader understand more clearly the whole family dynamics of such a religious saga.I salute you, Thomas Simmons, for your courage and your willingness to share your journey!"
5,Happy with the Schwinn 203,"I am age 60,have plantar fasciitis (foot pain) and cannot leave my disabled husband alone, so needed a way to exercise indoors. This 203 Schwinn recumbent has been excellent. It is clearly a quality product, very quiet. The seat is supportive and comfortable, so I do not need to use my hands to steady myself. Thus I have begun doing arm lifts and such while I ride, for a more complete workout. I am a short 5 foot 2 1/2 inches, but on the closest seat setting, I can reach the pedals fine. Anyone much shorter or with very short legs might have problems reaching. Also, it is not the 'walk-through' kind, so you must be able to lift your leg over the center section to use it. I wish it had a brighter or lighted digital readout, and that it would read my pulse with only one hand on the side sensors, but those are small problems. I recommend it highly and would choose it again."
4,Love it!!,"The bike had very easy to follow directions and took a little over an hour to assemble. I've used it an average of 5 hours a week since it arrived, and it seems very durable. The computer has several programs to choose from with various level in each to keep it challenging. Best of all - I am really starting to see changes in my body!!"
1,Wrong Choice,"Purchased this bike from Academy $349.99. Drove the 80 miles one way to pick up at nearest store. Assembly was fairly straight forward,, Needed help from wife to hold a few things for me. Plastic cap on rear leg was broken. After assembly, plugged adapter in and wanted to test the bike... NO POWER. Computer would not work. Disassembled mast, checked wiring, wiring OK, reassembled, still no power. Called Customer Service, waited 5 minutes on hold, no answer. Will be taking the bike back to Academy for full refund. Read several reviews where this bike was the bike to purchase... WRONG..... Will look at other brands now."
4,great bike-poor packaging,"The Schwinn recumbent exercise bike is everything one could ask for given the price. However, it arrived in packaging that was falling apart. If not for the hard band around the box, it would have had no packaging at all. The electronic monitor was damaged and we are still working out a solution on that. Schwinn should invest in better packaging to deter such damage claims."
4,Schwinn 203 Recumbent Exercise Bike,"Took two tries to get this right. The first delivery took 10 days and the item was broken to pieces. Amazon support was very helpful and got the replacement item to me in 3 days. simply amazing. The delivery folks picked up the broken unit when they delivered the new unit. Assembly is no fun, but since we had already been through it once, my wife and I put the second one together in about a hour. The unit works good, but the display is hard to read because the display is LCD black/gray with now contrast adjustments."
5,Know your stuff,"Douglas Ward certainly knows his stuff. The 2006 edition is the best yet with loads of relevant information on the ships not only for cabin size, food etc. Knowledge of what type of cruise will suit you, and who are likely to be your fellow passengers are of great interest especially as ships get bigger. He obviously prefers the smaller more intimate and classy ships rather than the floating Las Vegas type. I concur.However, having said this, I find the reviews are unbiased. Well worth the $$$$."
5,Truly feel-good story,"I never read this as a child, and now read it for the first time as a parent. Heart-warming and wonderfully uplifting. I really enjoyed reading it and highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful classic for all ages,"I vaguely remember reading this book as a child or pre-teen and liking it. Since it was free from Amazon as an e-book, I decided to pick it up again. It really is a wonderful story, and I think I got more out of it (and appreciated it) more as an adult."
3,16's Book Review,"The Secret GardenAre you interested in finding treasure, yet too lazy to dig it up? You won't have to! Just order a book (or, you can get it at the bookstore, but it is just easier) called The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett on this website (amazon.com). It is about Mary Lennox who is sick, fretful, and scornful. She goes to live with her uncle at Misselthwaite Manor, a mansion on a Yorkshire moor. It is very old and mysterious place full of secrets that Mary uncovers. Read along with Mary and her friends to find out more. Readers should be age 9 and further, and if you have a dictionary, you'll need it. I hope you find this book as exciting as I do and find a load of enjoyment (treasure, in a different sense)!"
4,#5's book review,"Do you like secrets that are locked away? If you do then The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett is the book for you. This book is about a ten year old girl, Mary, who was sent away after her Ayah and parents died. Mary finds a secret garden at the manor that has been locked up for ten years. Do you think she will open it or not? Read the book and find out! For ages 9 and up."
2,The Secret Garden,"I thought at the begging of the story it would be a very good book. Then once i started reading it i didn't like it at all. I didn't think the story had very many exciting things in it. The only thing that was a little exciting was when Mary found Colin.That was the only part that really made me say ""WOW"" I thought the charactors were a little weird for likeing to smell the dirt and stuff. Also, the book seemed a little choppy and it didnt' flow well. Over all, i dont' recommend this book to any one who likes to read interesting stories."
3,A heartwarming tale,THis is a tale of a lost little girl who is sent off somewhere. Her enviornment changes her and she soon learns the secrets of where she lives.
2,this book is not my favorite.,The Secret Garden is not the best book I have ever read and I dont think I will want to read it again an I do like the movie better then the book. I do have to say that I like the end of the book the best because that is when everything is solved well I will try to write more reviews in the future....................... ttyl
3,10's Book Review,"Have you ever wanted a secret garden all to yourself? If so, The Secret Garden is the book for you. This book is written by Frances Hodgson Burnett. Mary, Dickon, Colin, and Ben Weatherstaff are all working on a magical garden. Find out what happens with the garden. This book is perfect for boys and girls ages 9 and up."
4,ageless for entertainment of a sweet read,A sweet read at any age.Takes you back to your youth and how everthing is an adventure.Wonderful to keep a secret from all adults makeing you feel like you have power over them.
3,The Secret Garden,"The Secret Garden is probably a great book for children, I remember being excited about the story as a child. The book isn't as interesting as an adult. The entire time I read it I was waiting for something mystical or magical to happen. I was dissaponted that the story never drove to a mind blowing event. I've probably been too exposed to media to truly appreciate the novel, but I'm sure The Secret Garden will remain a classic, and a literary standard of greatness for many generations."
5,One of my favorites,I have always loved this book and was thrilled to find it in a kindle edition. I have been collecting classics for my kindle -- how much easier to be able to pull up anything you like from Socrates to Swift to Burnett?I re-read this book one afternoon while I was supposed to be working on the sailboat. It was lovely.
5,How Great Is This Technological Age!,"I was so pleased to find this children's favorite in a CD audio set. The Secret Garden was a favorite of mine as a child and I shared it with my children when they were small.As a teacher of Alternative Education I am always trying to find ways to engage my students. Very often their reading skills are poor so it is important for them to approach reading in a different fashion.They are thoroughly enjoying the book, as they follow along with their abridged versions. My students are eager to come to class every day because it's not the usual drudgery of classroom instruction.I can't thank you enough for providing me so quickly with what I needed to make my students' learning experience more valuable."
4,A Nice Book,"The secret garden is a timeless classic. It is a very enjoyable read, and you can even download it for free as I did. It is definitely worth downloading."
5,A story with a lesson,"I remember reading this book when I was in Prep school and I loved it! I am now 20 years old and I was so happy I found the longer version of this book - I love this story!I really enjoyed the message of the book which was that your mind can either help you or harm you all because of your thoughts (therefore, perceptions).I love the themes, dialogue, setting and all the characters, I don't think I will ever get tired of this book no matter how old I am."
5,AMAZING,Quality was great I enjoyed the book and it made me feel as if I was there great book! I would recommend it!
3,I first read this when I was in grade 5,"I have to say I liked the movie better, but the book is still pretty good. Maybe it's because I saw the movie first..."
3,okay.,I saw the movie before reading the book. The book pretty much was like the movie. there was nothing majorly exiting.
2,The Secret Garden,"The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson wrote The Secret Garden. A masterpiece to some and a waste of time to others. Personally, I thought it was both. Some parts interested me and some parts made me think about why I'm reading it. Now don't left that get to you and stop you from reading this book, I'm not fond of reading and the Secret Garden is my reading group book and I have to read it. It starts out like all books, like introducing the main characters and what happened to Mary, the main character. It talks about a spoiled brat, also known as Mistress Mary quit contrary, someone who couldn't dress herself and who barely got off her feet. Mary along with Dickon and Colin try to find the secret garden that they have heard much about. Also if you don't like to read Yorkshire, I wouldn't recommend this book, but if you think you would like this book, feel free to buy it but if you're not interested, you don't have to buy it."
5,Enchanting,"Sometimes there is a children's book that mystefies and enchants at the same time - that seems like it walked out of a dream. ""The Secret Garden"" is one of these books. The setting in untamed moores of England and the child whose grim outlook is changed simply by growing a garden is a fantasic combination. And when Burnett adds a fussy invalid cousin, a bright and cheery maid and her mischevious little brother, and the haunting memories of a beautiful aunt - you're hooked. The words seem to float right from the pages to form scenes of despair and drudgery, that change from their shades of dull gray to a bright and vivid garden, where the characters come alive."
2,Ok,It was different not one of the most interesting reads. I really don't care to read where children are mistreated
5,Powerfully Lyrical Poems...,"Many of the poems in this book are (by nature of their topic) full of feeling to the point where any gay man will be brought to tears. Monette's poems have powerful imagery and a lyrical quality like that of dreams and nightmares.The ""Elegies for Rog"" were written during the death and dying of Monette's partner during his bout with AIDS and will serve as comfort and empowerment to anyone in the face of despair.After having fallen in love with Monette's poetry, I later came across his autobiography, ""Becoming a Man : Half a Life Story."" It brings out topics prevalent in homosexuality and coming of age which are too often supressed by the mistakenly common 'gay lifestyle.'As a poet, I highly recommend both of these books."
5,Best iced tea ever,"These bags make it really easy to make a big jug of iced tea, the real kind, not that powdered s#*& you get at the supermarket. And it's very good-tasting tea, either brewed by itself or by adding in a few flavored tea bags to the brew."
1,horrid software,"I'm a software engineer and a computer scientist with 11 years of programming experience and two advanced degrees, so I consider myself at least intelligent enough to operate most techie devices, if not program them. However, after 1 hour of screwing with this audio player and it's poorly designed software (the understatement of the year), I packed it up and sent it back.I was unable to successfully download a single mp3. When I thought I finally had one transferred to the audio player (after about 100 reboots of both my PC and the RPA), it would not play it. Nothing. No sound. I should have known it was crap when I first opened the box and saw the flyer with a description of how to fix the audio player after it has locked up. I'm really depressed because I liked the unique design of the hardware and the fitness strap, but for ~ $... USD, I think these kind of usability oversights are inexcusable. If you decide to buy this thing, I hope you have more patience than I do..."
2,Buy the Rio Cali instead,"This is a cute mp3 player and it worked fine for me under win2k. I didn't even need the software; I could just drag and drop files. But it really is a piece of junk. All you have to do is turn your head and the headphones fall off. And the player cannot do anything besides stop and play. I exchanged it for the Rio Cali (which was cheaper and just as cute) and it seemed like a small computer by comparison (it has repeat, shuffle, FM radio, bookmarks, date/time, stopwatch, and is very configurable.)Also, for those who care, the Nike player will not work under linux (I spent two excruciating days trying... that was the main reason I returned it), and the Rio Cali worked perfectly on my first try."
3,Could be much more...,"Expected more from Nike and Phillips. I am a medium runner, doin g about 30-miles a week. The head phone wire only lasted a couple months, then broke. The software has been a real problem. Locks up my computer and consumes CPU time.However, while it worked, I really liked the size, weight and sound quality. Not too keen on the arm strap. I prefer a waist strap (fanny[pac]). Not sure how to convert. have been using a pocket in my shorts.Could also use a roaming or shuffle feature to mix up the order. i found the unit could easily hold three albumns in the normal mode."
2,Problematic software,"I bought this about 2 years ago after a review from Outside magazine labeling it the best mp3 player. The design of the player is very attractive to the sports enthusiast. However, the software is very user-unfriendly. My wife bought one several months later. She returned the first one due to problems with it locking up, not reading the device, and never playing music. The second player played for a short while and then experienced the same problems. About 6 months later my player completely locked up will not show that there is any music on the player and will not play at all. I liked the player when it was working, but I think there are some serious flaws that have yet to be ironed out. If you are looking for a good MP3 player to use while exercising, I suggest looking elsewhere."
2,Not worth the Money,"Broke after 10 months of owning, and no way to get it replaced, customer service sucks. My buddy bought one too and his broke after 6 months. I wouldn't waste my money on the thing, not worth it."
1,looks aren't everything,"I bought this player last spring because I loved the look of it, and I am attracted to shiny objects. I had just started running and wanted something smaller than a cd player to take with me.It has never worked properly. I'm pretty comfortable with technology, but this player was impossible. It was not compatible with windows XP, which was not made clear when I bought it-any success in my attempts to get music actually loaded on to the player was purely accidental. The musicmatch interface sucks (and constantly asks you to buy the version that costs extra). My endeavors to to upgrade the player at Phillips website resulted in 2 fatal system errors on my brand new computer.Shame on you Nike-I was expecting better from you.Go with apple or rio instead- they know what they are doing."
3,"Great story, but seems there should be more to it.","While the overall story about Tom's life after the civil war is good, I would have liked to know what he did between the chapter where his wife died in childbirth and the next chapter where his daughter is 11 years old! The ending indicates that Tom plans to leave the Army, but in Book 16, ""The Jeweled Spur,"" which is about his daughter several years later, he's still in the Army, and never intends to leave. In another later book, Sky & Rebekah's children hold a reunion, and this time Tom HAS left the Army. He'd be considered quite wishy-washy in real life!"
5,It's a trip from the early days of Freestyle Fellowship,"This album is a classic, without a doubt! Acey has certainly found his way from the gun-toting lyrics and blackitolism he used to preach...some of it lives on, and it's all for the best..My only complaint is that now the world finally knows what my man Acey's been up to, it's impossible to find his first album, All Balls Don't Bounce...because that even surpasses this release..."
2,Lyrics with no delivery and no beats,"The problem with this CD was not in the fact that he didn't have something important to say. It was the fact that his delivery was boring. And the beats were far from anything you could get into. With the CD comes the lyrics...so maybe what he should have done is make a BOOK of his ""a book of human language"" instead of a CD."
4,Aceyalone carries the torch ..,"Aceyalone is one of the few rap artists today who, in the tradition of KRS One and Public Enemy, finds a balance between excellent flow and intelligent lyrics. Add Mumbles' trippy, offbeat production skills and you have an instant hip hop classic. It's too bad many rap fans flock to the likes of Puff Daddy instead of artists, like Aceyalone, who are truly keepin' it real."
2,Not Quite there,"This book isn't as powerful as I had hoped. It was a weak general introduction, and not enough to get you going all by itself. I was dissappointed that the postgresql syntax in the book didn't seem to still be the same as the syntax used in the postgresql version included in Red Hat 7.3.This left me high and dry on how many arguments to pass to the pg_connect command. I was treated better by the MySQL database."
1,Lacking content,"D.Palmer must have had a bad hair day.Not much of a plot.Boring,not like her previous books,which I have always enjoyed.Come on Diana get back on track."
5,Essential Reading for Every Christian,"The early church fathers offer a rich wealth of thought and reflection on the text of the Scriptures.This series has established itself as essential reading. It offers a manageable overview of the thought of the Early Church Fathers.Of course, decisions about what to provide for readers is subjective, but the Ancient Christian Commentary offers an excellent roadmap into the world of thought of the fathers of the early church."
4,It did the trick,"Not the thickest most resilient stuff, but it has a ton of colors, and if you're training yourself- then you have a lot of paper to train on."
4,Great product!,Great origami paper! Working with foil paper is different than regular origami paper.. Kinda have to be more careful not to make mistakes but still fun to work with.
5,pronunciation games (cambridge copy selection9,"This book has made the teaching, and learning, of pronunciation a joy. It has changed both my own and my students' attitude towards pronunciation lessons."
2,The Pooh Story,"For a video for this age, I think there could have been a better story line.A little slow moving and sometimes even boring. Prachi"
1,"If the ""facts"" aren't really facts, what is left?","A memo to the authors of this book: not everything mentioned as a fact really is so. This book repeats just about every urban myth there is. And since there are no explanations, there is no way to decide whether the rest of them are true. Ridiculously badly researched, and I don't even want to think of the harm that books like this cause at dinner parties...the wall of China is not the only human construction visible from space! Check Google Earth and see whether it is even among the easiest.Read the Straight Dope books and you'll have dozens of these corrected. With explanations."
3,"Was happy. Now, not so much.","I bought my MP3 player about a year and a half ago. It was a purchased on a whimm. I did no research and saw it on sale at the store. I was happy, I used the Windows media player on both the windows me and windows xp operating systems. Only to have the player stop working. I can download all the music I want to it, I just can't get it play any of it. A year and a half of moderate use, no dropping, no getting wet, only going through about 4 or 5 batteries, and now its dead. I'll leave it up to you whether you think a year and a half of use is worth the price.Oh as a side note, if you decide to purchase one definately go bigger than the 64 MB It has about 45 min to an hour of songs, which can bug you when they start to repeat.Over all the time I had with the player was good, if terribly short."
1,Software is ridiculous,"The Nike PSA player itself looks like a great little device, and is the perfect size for working out. I wouldn't know firsthand, though, because I never could get the driver software to install. The MusicMatch software installed quickly on Windows XP, but the drivers would not. After trying all of the updates from the Philips websites, and Firmware updates, still, nothing. This was all attempted by a network engineer who troubleshoots software and hardware installations for a living. I then attempted to use the Philips help line, but they were of no help at all. After reading numerous reviews, it is clear to me that there are definite problems with the software, and it's not worth taking a chance by purchasing this product."
2,Typical Power Pop blah...,"I instantly fell in love with the incredible catchy single ""New Tokyo Is Calling"". But like junk food, The Stereo is a bnad that at first you crave, and soon after you become quite sick of. The four chord power pop songs that are prevalent on this album (and others by the band) are songs that intriguing by their sheer simplicity, but eventually left me looking for something else. If you found the opening track off of Jimmy Eat World's latest album (Bleed American) wonderful and loveable, then this EP is right up your alley. If you long for something more complex and musically dense, move on. After a few more spins of this disc, I've gotta remove three of my original five stars."
4,Fun with minor adjustments,"I couldn't wait to get my friends together at the range and do some ""plinkn"" but not before a minor adjustment. I decided to weld some 12 inch extensions on each leg to anchor the target a bit deeper and bring the target up a bit-perfect. We had a good old time dinging that target. It was fun seeing that target jump . Everything was going great until the club president shut us down. It appears club rules are paper targets only. Check your club's rules or head out of dodge to a safe location and enjoy your day plink'n away. It was fun, thumbs up."
5,Great Target,I use this primarily for my 9mm at a distance of about 25 feet. Works great. I built a stand because the range I go to its hard to get it in the ground. Tough target. At the range some (insert title if idiot here) shot this with a 30-30 at my 25 feet while I was shooting it with my pistol and the target took it pretty well. It did mushroom out the back a little with a dent about half way in the target.Target works great especially if not shot close with High Powered Riffles.
3,A great lesson of cinema does not necessarily make a great movie!,"It's an interesting piece but it goes in so many directions. It could have been a Felini movie, a US version of Fellini, but the second part is to slow. As a fan of Tom Waits, I had to see it anyway...And just for the camera movement, you have to see it, but the music hall part is a bit too much."
1,There is no proof this works - beware parents,"Think parents - if football helmets do not protect against concussions - how could a sweat band with padding?Beware of products to reduce concussions, says NOCSAE[...]"
4,soccer headgear,Headgear is worn by my daughters for soccer to help reduce the risk of a concussion. I think it does add a nice layer of protection for their heads and padding for their gentle brains. It does rub on their forehead and cause a bit of friction burning while they play. I am told by another player who also wears this type of headgear that once the headgear is broken in (fits the shape of her head) that stops as it stays in place and does not move around.
2,DEFECTIVE..SENT IT BACK,I had to send it back because it would shut off after 10 minutes of cook time. Very disappointed. I've had one of these for years. It still works but the bowl is scratched so I thought I'd replace it. I guess my next choice will be the fuzzy logic. If I have problems there I will have think Zojirushi is not a great company any longer.
5,The Beast Master,"This is one of the first adventure books I ever read and that was in 1984. I still have it. And once a year I get to read, and enjoy it all-over-again. I Love this book."
1,Yawn.,"Storm is a Beast Master; he can communicate by touch and telepathy with his eagle, meercats, and dune cat. He has been orphaned, now that his home planet is a mere cinder in space. So, he goes to Arzor, seeking revenge. This is a sincerely boring book. The plot meanders all over the place like a lazy stream. Character development is poor. Frankly, I didn't care whether Storm was able to exact revenge or not. I was more interested in his meercat than him. Good thing it was a short book; it didn't take me too long to blaze through it."
3,Gross indeed.,"""The Ruins"" stars 5 Americans who set out to poke their noses where they shouldn't. Not a new premise.They find this jungle that they KNOW better not to come to, and even worse, find an ancient ruin hidden in the middle of it. Surprised, and stoked, they decide that they want to take a closer look.But that's not always the smart thing to do. Foreigners surround them and even kill one of their friends. They have no choice but to climb the ruin which later you learn, is bound by these moving, and seem-ably breathing plants.It's a strange movie indeed, and some happenings ""ruin"" the movie, but I think overall, it's worth at least one watch. Based on the book of the same name by Scott Smith (of which I have yet to read), ""The Ruins"" catches the eye if you like gore, or simply don't like it because it's here; in its over-the-top fashion and it doesn't let up!3.4 stars."
4,Underrated Horror Film,"I had not read the book, in fact, I didn't even know what the movie was about. I was bored one afternoon, so decided to go to a matinee. The theater was almost completely empty and I wondered if I had wasted another $7 on a horribly boring/lame scary movie. I didn't. I loved this film. Considering that the only horror movies getting made are crappy remakes of classics and asian films, The Ruins was a breath of fresh air."
2,Mixed emotions,"As soon as I saw the trailer, I couldnt wait to find the book. I was just about ready to order in when I had gone to visit my mother and found it in the trash. She said my sister had read it and immediately tossed it. I couldnt resist and went ahead and delved into it. Even though it was so predictable and stupid at times, I couldnt put it down and read it in 2 days. It read just like a movie (gratuitous sex scenes and all). Dumb dumb dumb. But on the other hand, I cant wait to see the movie."
4,Better than the book,"I read Scott Smith's novel several years ago and absolutely hated it. I couldn't wait for the characters to become ""infected"" with plant matter and celebrated when the characters died a horrible death! When I finally relented and saw the movie, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it and wanted the screen characters to live. The acting is terrific and makes up for the depressing situation the characters find themselves in. I found myself rooting for these kids to make it out alive but knowing how the book ended and that Smith wrote the screenplay, I figured the story would remain faithful to the novel. Oh, well..."
3,MIXED REVIEW (Spoilers),"I am very biased when it comes to The Ruins. I loved the book and I have listened to the abridged audio and plan to listen to the unabridged audio this summer. I also plan to paint vines and red flowers on my posts in front of my house.Scott Smith, who wrote the book, wrote the screenplay and obviously did not read his own book! This movie has to be taken for what it is, a schlocky horror movie. In the book, the plant has evil intelligence and manipulates its five victims. In the movie, I felt that aspect is gone. My favorite scene in the book did not make it to the movie. Instead, the producers, Ben Stiller being one of them, went for the graphic gore of foot amputation and under-skin vine removal. Again, watch it and take it for what it is, a bad horror movie. Then get amnesia and read the book, it's a page turner."
3,Not for everyone - watchable...,"I bought this dvd as a gift for someone who loves it, but I cannot say that I agree. The storyline is not impressive - the predictability of this film is obvious from beginning to end. The acting is mediocre, and although certain parts are gory (and gross), I found myself rolling my eyes over and over again. Despite my review, the movie is watchable if you are forced to, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a movie."
2,Never really got under my skin ...,"Well it was at least a cool idea...ancient Mayan ruins are a great pretext/setting for a movie, and the story had potential. Unfortunately the decent build-up thruout the movie fizzled out once you find the vegetation is pretty much the gist of the horror. I wonder who decided to give the flower buds the ability to mimic speech? That was a sorta neato thing, but the fact that they only cried out certain phrases and the vines only moved at certain 'high drama' parts of the movie, made the whole fiasco feel like something a juvenile would have scripted! The actors made the whole thing mildly watcheable in spite of the goofiness, but there's no denying so much more could have been done within the fascinating lore of the Mayan world"
1,"YES, this movie is in RUINS.","I've not read the book this film was based on. Despite that, I still find this movie delivers no suspense nor thrilling. There are a couple of scary scenes. For example, it's the scene where one of the girls cut off the flesh from her leg to get rid of the plants that had eaten it way into her body. The acting is below par. I do not feel sympathetic for the characters. The worse thing is the special effects. The devilish plants look fake.It's a typical bad B movie. I am glad my friend rented it for us."
2,Read the book!,"Having read Scott Smith's book, ""The Ruins"" at least three times and listening to the audio CD as well, I was very disappointed with the movie version. The movie was loosely based on his wonderful and highly entertaining novel. I implore anyone who only saw the movie to do yourself a huge favor and read the novel. There were some engaging moments in the movie but they were few and far between. Rarely have I seen a movie veer so far away from the main story line of a novel. Perhaps ""The Ruins"" should have been a TV mini-series instead so that there would be adequate time for much needed character development. May there NOT be a movie sequel. Sigh."
3,"imo, the book is far more scary","i read the book sometime last year, and i thought it was great. based on such a simple concept as it was, it was scary. i couldnt wait to get the movie, but i have to say, i was a little disappointed. if you just have to see it, i would rent it, otherwise i would get the book and read it, it will give you far more thrills than the movie i think. it keeps you guessing and it has more chilling details that they left out of the movie, due to obvious reasons, its hard to put indefinable into a movie."
2,The Ruins.,"Creative Yes,but scary? NO. **Spoiler** Plants that come at you and grow on you and in you? Original but not what one would expect."
3,Good thing I'd read the book!,"(Incidentally, this movie was not an Instant Video)When I read The Ruins it fascinated me to the point that I re-read it immediately. I've read it a couple more times since then. The movie seemed to take some of the major events from the book and display them in (somewhat) shocking detail. The characters were switched around and eliminated willy-nil. But those things were not what the movie lacked and made it mediocre: There was little, if any, exploration into the emotional and psychological factors that plagued each of them. So we really didn't get to know them; we didn't see the devastating effects of the food and water scarcity. We didn't see the remains of Gunther's brother and several others hidden beneath the vines. We didn't see one of the girls weeping over the thought of her wristwatch sitting on the end table back at their air-conditioned hotel room. . .if only. The whole other side of physical discomfort wasn't even touched. Also, the ending was stupid."
2,"INTERESTING AND SHOCKING, BUT ABRUPT ENDING SINKS IT! 2 1/2 STARS!","What could have been a pretty solid horror effort, ends up feeling rushed with an unsatisfying ending. The story starts with the usual meet the cast and put them in a stupid situation first act, but the second act which is the best part of the film is actually pretty good.This film has some pretty graphic gore and they don't pull any punches! Some of this was laugh out loud funny as it's so over the top, I had to wonder who thinks of the stuff! :-D It's fairly well acted and the tension is there, but it has a rather abrupt ending and I felt it left a few questions unanswered. It's worth a look at 2 1/2 stars and delivers some of the goods!"
3,Ok better than ok pretty good.,"Not bad has a few cool ideas, it is worth watching, i like the cool twilight zonesque feel of the movie."
1,RUINED,"Scott Smith's book has a pulpy, can't put it down quality. Your pulse quickens as these petulant, spoiled twentysomethings find themselves embroiled ever deeper in a nightmare from which they can never emerge. The movie, with its brilliant blue skies and gorgeous cinematography, lays bare the idiocy of the story, which at its best is in fact a well-paced sci-fi horror book, truly beyond description - and obviously beyond believability. Here on the big screen, with barely average actors, there are virtually no thrills beyond those which are placed there (cue the music; see the evil malicious vine dart up at the screen 3-d style! Scream!). The new Hollywood ending is laughable - it is a naked attempt to cash in on a quick sequel (please spare us). This is a movie that is truly more nauseating than scary, and best avoided at all costs."
3,Watchable horror film won't impress too much,"I watched the blu-ray version on a 1080 HD Projector on a screen approximately 120"" diagonal. Quality of the transfer to Blu Ray was high and the sound effects/music good as well.Not so good was the movie itself. The premise of the movie, best described as shrubs gone wild, doesn't really lend itself to building much tension, much less actual horror. It doesn't help that the killer plants, especially on the blue ray version, don't look that real.Without any tension, the film becomes more of a gorefest, and with an amputation scene and a self-mutalation scene, it delivers to that on some extent. Some of the characters are sympatheic and you can root for their survival, but unfortunately the sympatheic characters die off before the end leaving only the ones you wish would die. At least the acting is alright, and there is enough action to hold your interest."
2,Yum yum eat 'em up,"A bunch of just of age kids locate a missing ruins in Mexico (really Australia). Of course, they are compelled to go and have a good time in the jungle. They run into strange armed people and have a symbiosis with the local flora.This is a standard spooky ""eat them sexy dump girls"" movie. So why not at least three stars for a mediocre display of blood and gore? Because there is no effort to mask the story or add, any depth to this ridicules premise.The added German accent was a nice touch and sticking close to the book helped but this is one novel that just does not morph well to a movie.This film of course is a good candidate for Blu-ray as it has great color, detail, and sound. Too bad, it is wasted on a movie that is a cheap knockoff of people that need to be eaten.The Ruins by Scott SmithLittle Shop of Horrors (1960)BloodlustThe Day of the Triffids"
2,Four Americans on a vacation don't just disappear!,"Goofy, stupid movie, with all the usual cliche's of dumb Americans (usually Caucasians) who get themselves into situations with ""the unseen horrors of this world"" - woooooooo! All these people needed was a an airstrike of Weed-B-Gone.The vines ringing like bells and chasing the two women in the cave reminded me of ""The Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes."" Some of the dialogue in the scenes were absolutely hilarious and laughable. The amputation scene was a riot. If you've nothing else to watch; this is an average horror movie for a laugh,"
2,Charger doesn't work,"The vacuum works just fine, the attachments are useful, but the charger didn't work when I bought it. I called the toll-free number and they told me how to make the charger work by pulling the contacts out, which I did, but it won't stay fixed. The contacts are flimsy and need to be redesigned.I wish I had taken it back when it first didn't work. It's not worth the irritation."
2,I love That Girl but not this DVD,I was very dissapointed in this DVD as it contained only 4 episodes. It should have contained the entire year for this price. :-(
2,Smaller than average sampler,"This was not my first time buying 'sampler' DVDs, and I'm fully aware that some 'first season' broadcasts were mid-season replacements. However, normally 'season one' means a compilation of easily 6-8 episodes. This was a great disappointment. Only four episodes are included.I well remember enjoying ""That Girl"" in its first run, and had not seen it in years. I'd expected a pleasant trip 'down memory lane.' I regret now that (since, as it true of many, I cannot afford Netflix or $36 DVD sets) I'd purchased what I thought could be some enjoyable breaks, only to find just four episodes, and those before the characters were well-developed. Even at this price, it is not worth the money."
4,Perfect for a chilly night,I bought this wrap to wear to dinner over a sleeveless formal dress. I wore it on a recent cruise and had formal pictures taken and this wrap looked fabulous
1,Very Disappointed,Very stiff. Not easy to drape. Looks cheap and like I could have made one better. Does not cover the shoulders -- I am a small lady. Would not recommend. Poor quality.
3,okay phone battery for $5.31,I usually stay away from anything made by G E. just my past experiences with their products. I needed a battery for my cordless home phone and this G E battery was the only one that would fit. Not the best price but it beat buying a new phone. I could have bought a different brand battery and switched the end plastic plug from my old battery. Anyway I'm taking a chance on this G E battery and will edit this review if it craps out early as I've read that the 700 milli amp hour batteries do NOT last long........ I paid $5.31 from amazon now it's over $10 here.
4,2 Problems with 604,"1) You have to buy the CD to really understand what they do (so nix that download idea unless u pull the full album).2)Even after you buy the CD you still might hate it (ok, you'll probably dig it if amazon pushed you into this section anyway)Unless you're a fan of 80's synth pop/rock/electronica, don't even bother... This took me a good 5 listens until i started to jive with their whole deal- Funky electronica (though nothing new to you hard-core heads) combined with the monotone voices reminiscent of those good ol' electronica days. It's got a few spats of songs that'll knock your socks off, but nothing spectacular. Once you get around that ""what am i listening to?"" phase, 604 will suck you into the wonderful world of Ladytron."
5,Locking Mailbox,This product is better than expected. I had read the prior reviews and decided I could live with the few faults that were listed. I was surprised to see all the listed faults had been corrected. The box I received is perfect. The Solar Group obviously listens to their customers concerns and fixes the problems. This is a great product. It is the best value I could find while retaining high quality. I highly recommend this locking mailbox.
4,Durable but Drab,"I have had this rug for three years now, and it has held up great. It cleans easily and doesn't show stains (and I have pets!) It is not very plush or thick, but it is soft enough for my taste. The only complaint I have is that the rug is much more muted and drab than it appears in the photo - what appears to be vibrant blues/purples are actually very dull grays that blend with the beiges. The rug does tend to pick up the color of the furniture around it, however (I originally had the rug in a room with a denim sofa, so the blues stood out a little bit, but now it is with light beige furniture, so it looks beige and brown with a hint of gray.) Overall, if you are looking for a durable rug of muted earth-tones with just a HINT of gray and slate blue, this is a good choice for your money."
1,Wrong views,This book is all wrong and if we continue to add people to this planet we surely push our people to destruction! Total BS!
1,ZERO STARS,"This movie is the phoniest, most stupid, boring movie I have ever seen (actually the first XXX was worse). Don't waste your money. Even if you get this for free somehow, don't watch it. The acting was horrible, the writing was bad, and the action was phony. Avoid this movie at all costs."
1,Zero Stars - R for Racist,"The plot is basically this: Bad guys and gals are ONLY white, a token intimidated white male who is a geek, and good guys are blacks who all are into whores, stealing, and cars. I don't know which is worse - the stereotyping of all whites as evil or the stereotyping of all blacks as brutal street thieves. <GAG> This movie is worse than I thought it was possible for a movie to be. The plot is basically a black separatist mentality coupled with really bad dialogue hiding behind rapid images and pounding music. This is definitely NOT Dr King's dream!"
4,Ice Cube as XXX,"Suspend disbelief, or Alter your mental state, and roll with it. The plot is not particularly believable, but Ice Cube is the man on screen. His attitude and person take over the movie, and he makes up for major plot holes in the film. This one cannot be taken as realistically (?) as Van Diesel'sXXX (Unrated Director's Cut), but this movie is fun and entertaining.If you think of the film asFriday Collection (Friday / Next Friday / Friday After Next)meets XXX, its all good. However I will watch anything with Ice Cube in the flick. I think he was stretching it a bit on this one, but countless scenes compensate for the unbelievable aspects. Have a Margarita, and roll with the inconsistencies. The action and Tank Jacking are worth it."
1,Horrible,"First of all, this movie had nothing to do with XXX. Ice Cube was XXX by name only. He wasn't much of an action hero or extreme sports expert. Also, have any of you ever seen a worse actor than that guy who played Ice Cube's sidekick. I couldn't believe it. Lastly,the effects were awful. When the car was chasing the train at the end it seemed like i was watching a video game. Just terrible movie, and i did like the first."
3,deceiving,looks like a draft control for a standard stove...but its only 5 inches!!!.....doesnt say that size any where in the description. useless!!
5,Astonishing!,"This book caught my attention because of the unusual title and I love to try out picks off the mainstream list! Am I glad I did!!!I was stunned at how haunting each of these stories were...a friend and I talked about the significance and meaning for hours!I cannot recommend this book enough, this book will stay with you and will unexpectedly surprise you!You will savor these stories and find yourself thinking about them unexpectedly throughout the day. Now, that is powerful! I will not be lending my copy to friends!"
2,Bad Purchase,"I regret this purchase because you need to have the drill and saw plugged into the generator in order for it to work. This doesn't make sense because all three take batteries and the wires get crossed and tangled. Also, to carry three pieces at once makes it impossible for my young son to walk around ""using"" his tools. It frustrated him so much that I put it away and we no longer use it."
5,Knowing your not alone,This book helps any survivor realize that they are not alone in this healing journey. There are plenty of actual accounts of survivors and their stories. Along with lists that help connect the dots with our current behaviors and the past. Eye opening and soul serching this book is a life saver.
2,A dated teenage girl's novel,"ICE PALACE is probably a teenage girl's novel, as the main character is a young woman ""coming of age"". The pedantic ""facts about Alaska"" would also probably be better tolerated by a young reader, accustomed to the style from school books. However, the book was apparently written in the 1950s, and many of the facts, as well as expressions are dated. As a middle aged male, I found the novel to be weak, and I could not recommend it to another adult."
5,Pura bohemia ranchera,"A quien le guste el bolero...el romance...el poema, le encantara este CD. Juan Valentin hace un excelente trabajo interpretando la poesia folklorica de Martin Urieta. Adquierelo, no te arrepentiras."
2,Without the photos it is a hard read.,"No interaction with people, just word portraits of landscape written beautifully. But it is painful to read photo captions and not see the photos."
3,Wonderful language captures the images and sounds of Morocco,"I hesitated when I bought this book, because other reviewers noted Wharton's prejudices but, I thought, it's Edith Wharton. How bad can it be? And as we plan a trip to that part of the world, I thought it would be worth reading. Well, there were pluses and minuses in the book. The greatest plus is Wharton's use of language that conveys the sounds, smells and sights of her adventure. However, she also writes with the attitutes of a time that, thank heaven, is gone - a time when white Americans and Europeans thought how they lived was the only true and proper way. For Wharton, only the French can save Morocco. It's too bad that these pervasive attitudes detract from an otherwise remarkable tale of travel in Morocco right after the First World War, but they do. Approach with caution."
3,Very Cute Panels!!!,I love these panels from Wendy Bellissimo. They look adorable with basically any window valance you choose. (I have Carter's Crazy Quilt valance from Babycenter.com) The only reason I did not give these panels 5 stars was because of the price. $30 per panel is quite expensive. I bought them anyway because I couldn't find anything else like them. Additionally I can use these panels by themselves or with a valance and they are very cute for either a boy or a girl.[...]They are just as cute and a bit cheaper. Hope this helps!
3,"Expensive, not fast at all...","I regret buying that USB stick, not fast at all and expensive compared to other flash drives. Also cap is loose and very easy to loose it."
2,Atmosphere with Nothing In It,"If you don't mind overtly pretentious gothic-industrial music, this might just be for you. Be forewarned, however, that if you did what I did and bought this album for a single track (Two Gods, in my case), you'll find very little in the way of variation. Every track uses the same bass synth, the same quasi-German expressionist wailing female vocals, the same hushed, almost chanted vocals. Which is all fine, if you don't like variety in your music. There is violin on every track, but it's used more for ambient noise than melody. Expect to hear that yawning tone and sinister sawing a lot."
1,Not a large print item,"I ordered 2 different New York Times Puzzle books that are listed as large print. Neither one is large print. This one says ""100 Sunday-sized Puzzles"" and is not in Large Print. Each Puzzle is on one page and has ""normal"" print size. It would be a great product if you were not looking for large print since the spiral binding makes it very user friendly."
5,A Secret,"Sheridan Hart's husband of seventeen years, Quentin, told her, ""I'm in love with someone else."" But what broke her heart was when he said that it was ""another"" man. Up until now, Sheridan thought that she had the perfect love, life, marriage and family. After this heart-wrenching news, she still had to deal with the reactions of her children, parents, brother, best friend, church members, pastor and others. Sheridan went through a lot of emotions: denial, anger, stress, anxiety, sadness, guilt, and loneliness. She held her faith and God was there for her-every moment-whether she realized it or not. Then she made her best decision-she decided to move on. This is a book for everyone to enjoy!"
5,Yay bonus tube of aftershave,"What can I say, I like the cool scent and low projection (I hate excessive perfume yuck).Also, bonus big tube of after shave; came in a sweet box too, I'm sure the box is worth $10 alone haha."
1,Mine was Fake,This is my first and last time buying Zegna online. The original product is great and gets a lot of compliments. My bottle does not bare the logo of Zegna on it and the smell is different from what I had before. Just be careful.
4,Panasonic CR2354,"This is my second order for the Panasonic CR2354 battery. The first order was on Dec 5, 2011 from NationalDeals. The battery arrived quickly but was dated 95 on the negative side of the cell.The second order was on Nov 18, 2012 from MyBatterySupplier and arrived quickly as well (Nov 23, 2012). The cells were much fresher than the others but were still dated 07 on the negative side.The fit my Vortex Sparc just fine and despite the age of the cells they last quite a bit longer than the no name cell that came with the Sparc. I will be purchasing them again as needed."
5,Replacement for lost remote,"My grandson lost one of my remotes for a Dish receiver. I thought that finding a replacement was really going to be a problem and expensive. I didn,t relish the idea of going back to Dish and ordering a new one. I found this one on the internet and was a little skeptical because the price seemed low. I ordered it anyway thinking what do I have to lose. Well the remote came very quickly, in brand new condition and was an exact replacement for the one that was lost. I am very pleased with this remote and the company that sold it to me. Very very nice and very painless."
3,Very Fluid and LightWeight but...,"I used this over and over again during a four month television shoot using the Panasonic HVX200 and while it was sturdy and very smooth, one of the aluminum joints easily snapped and would not respond to several bonding glues or cements. Replacement parts would take six to eight weeks from Manfrotto.The level bubble is a nice touch, although not always accurate when looking through the lens or at a monitor.Would have preferred a floor spreader, as this mid-level one is a bit useless and testy.Overall, if you plan on using this in one place and are willing to keep it safe from travel and other hazards then, along with the great case, it's a nice value. Just be wary - it is some what fragile. But being mostly aluminum makes this a great lightweight mobile unit."
4,cruise ships,Camera will not work for extended time when going from air conditioned area to high humidity (as on ships deck in the Carib.) Tape gets stuck quite a bit and gets frustrating also! (I assume same reason) Great filming otherwise.
4,fire wire challenge,"everything is nice,except the most important feature: challenge with exporting movies from the camcoder to the computer. Pentium 4 processor is highly recommended and it seems that all the files (no matter what quality you choose, refer to the manual) are at MPEG1 compression which practically renders them UNUSABLE! It takes cca 250MB of memory per one minute at normal quality! Everything else is impressive (don't get upset about the manuals and support, it could be better)."
5,Great product at a great price!!,"After being dissappointed with my RioVolt player I decieded to do a little more research before I spent another $. I read the reviews for iRiver ChromeX imp-150 and ordered the player and also ordered the car kit from iRiver. I have to say that this player sounds great, has excellent skip protection(in car use) and is easy to upgrade which is a plus. The iRiver web page is helpful and it is easy to keep the ChromeX updated.The remote, which is wired, is much better than the one included with the RioVolt player. I use mine only in the car and I have no complaints, it sounds great and is durable and easy to navigate. For the money, I have been extremely pleased."
3,Good unit but rebate will never come,This unit is fairly good for the money but the promised...rebate never showed up even though I filed over three months ago and the manufacturer said that they received it.When price comparing use the total price without the rebate. Other units may be better and cheaper when not figuring in the rebate amount.
5,best player for the money,"I love this cd/mp3 player, i take it everywhere with me. You can carry your entire cd collection around in one tiny cd wallet... it's great. And for the price, it is the best player out there."
5,I LOVE THIS ITEM!,"Oh, I love this item! I managed to get through my first pregnancy without any stretch marks. I'm now on my second pregnancy and was trying other store bought products, but NOTHING compares to this. The anti-itch ingredients make a huge difference. I used to pay $25 locally, but now I'm so happy that I found it at this amazing price!"
2,Does not work for me,"My stretch mark was light, I used the cream twice a day for one month, but it did not work at all for me."
4,"No miracle, but nice","I'm generally not a lotion person - it just seems like too much work. In my second pregnancy I've had some really itchy skin on my belly and hips and my mother bought this for me to try. It has eliminated my itchy skin (though it returns the next day if I don't use the lotion). My stretch marks seem to be lighter, but I suppose that's probably due to the fact that they're more moisturized than usual.The scent is pleasant and the texture is wonderful. It's not greasy or overwhelming in any way, but it is nice and thick. I'm someone who struggles with the decision to buy a $4 bottle of Curel, but I'll absolutely pay $13 for a tube of this."
2,The American everyday cookbook,"I was surprised at how old the book was, the pages are very old with age and hard to read, the binding was coming away from the pages. I am not sure I would purchase a amazon book again unless I was sure of the condition."
5,Fantastic advice for the diabetic patient,"It is a rare medical book indeed that is able to cater to both the doctor and patient. Dr. Chous ably accomplishes this demanding task with this book. Diabetic patients and their families will be able to better deal with the health dangers of the disease, especially the ocular side effects, after reading the clear, concise chapters. And medical professionals will want to have a copy on hand for the best summary of diabetic eye conditions that I have ever seen. Kudos to Dr. Chous for an intelligent, lively writing style, and for authoring this most excellent reference."
5,Illuminating the sources of Nouwen's depth,"Wil Hernandez provides us with a readable multifaceted look into the lifeand ministry of Henri Nouwen who has been a spiritual guide parexcellence to so many of us. One cannot read a page from Nouwen withoutsensing his depth. Wil's book illuminates the sources of this depth farbeyond what could be gleaned by those of us who have frequently returnedto Nouwen as a source of spiritual reading and guidance over many years.As Wil so ably shows us, Nowen's love of God, self and others wasBiblically faithful, theologically nuanced and psychologically soundwhich freed him, broken as he was, to engage others in the healing andtransforming ministry of Jesus. I highly recommend adding HenriNouwen: A Spirituality of Imperfection to your library if you have notyet done so.L. Paul Jensen, Orange, CA"
4,Struggling Readers,"Even though this was written for parents, it contains good suggestions for a reading teacher to give to parents of struggling readers."
5,Great shoe!,"This shoe is well made, comfortable, and stays looking good. You can wear this shoe everyday if needed and it will last a long time and stay looking new. It goes with everything, so it's perfect for your everyday shoe."
1,Disappointed,"I am a faithful Sketchers customer. I have purchased 6 pairs of Sketchers shoes in the past 5 years. The shoes have always proven durable. This pair, however, lasted less than one month! The sole came detached from the toe, and they are no longer wearable."
3,Amazed at the reviewers ...,"Do not pay attention at the other reviews of the book. It seem to me that that writer wrote this book only by watching CNN. I think I can say same about the reviewers.. Pakistan is much more, it's people and land offers much more. True, Pakistan inherited tons of problems, but this is also true that Pakistan is capable and willing to solve those issues. Just size, looted wealth, technology acquired in charity does not make nations great. This book miserably failed to reflect any light on the Tiger of Asia."
1,Piece of Crap!,"I purchased the Fossil Specialty - Positive Display watch for my husband. After only two months, it began to lose time, the digital display quit and the timer kept going off for no reason. I took it to three very reputable jewelers in Houston and none could repair it. I wrote to Fossil to inquire about repair, but have received no response in four months."
4,Lots of good stuff in a thin book,"I have read this and the ""iMovie 2: The Missing Manual"". I like the Visual Quickstart Guide a bit better because it is very concise but not lacking in information (true of the series).The thing with iMovie is that is seems like it should do more than it seems. While some of the techniques are not obvious, there are few of these (most presented in this book) that will definetly get your movies going. Get this book and look in the internet for additional sources of information."
1,Does this book help?,This book is a joke because the cultural content is very basic and it has many spelling and grammatically errors. It will not help to pass the test. Please keep away from it.
5,great remixes and some awesome new stuff too,"This collection of remixed BNH hits and some new songs is great for fans of their music. Most of the remixed songs are from the Brother Sister album but with a twist that makes buying this CD worth it. The vocals of Jan Kincaid in ""Keep Together"" are a refreshing change from the female vocals we're used to. The new songs are great too. If you're looking for a CD you can groove to, definitely check this out."
5,A Great Storyteller,"One of my earliest memories of 'adult' literature (as opposed to children's books) was reading ""Death in the Long Grass"" between assignments in grade school. Capstick is a wonderful author, with the perfect mix of writing style, humility, humor and wit. He leads the reader through a mix of emotions from the thrill of pressing trigger on a known man-eater to the tedium of hunkering down in a leopard blind all day. If you love hunting or Africa, your library isn't complete without the full collection of Capstick's work. Why not start with the first, and arguably still the best, of his writings?"
2,If you love wildlife or adventure I doubt you would like this book,"When I read some of the Jim Corbett books it made me feel that I was there with the author in the jungles on a real adventure, that was the most exciting part about reading wildlife books for me and also learning some interesting facts about animals being hunted, I could imagine the little hut where the young boy slept in the Leopard of Rudrapryag and how the maneater of mohan would have stalked his victims, If you loved Jim Corbett kind of books you would hate this, it also gave me a good idea on why we have such desparate populations of some of the most beautiful wildlife species today...it seems author had animal culling as his main job, I didn't like the style of writing...book has some really interesting parts but they are rare like some of the wildlife the author and many others hunted to near extinction..."
3,Dissapointing to say the least.,"When I bought this album I rushed home to play it, as I have been a fan since 1995 when Everclear released ""Sparkle and fade"". But I have to say ""Songs From An American Movie Vol. 1"" was a big disappointment, what has happened to the rock sounds of ""Heroin Girl"", ""Heartspark Dollar Sign"" (Sparkle and Fade), ""So much for the Afterglow"" and ""Amphetamine"" (so much for the Afterglow).The new sound is no where near as good as the old, but things aren't all bad. The new sound is quirky, and easy to listen to with high points in ""AM Radio"" and the cover of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" (which I have to say, despite being good, is no where near as good as the Van Morrison original). To some extent these tracks rescue the album, just.If you're a die hard fan of the Everclear of old, I would think twice about buying this latest offering. However, if you are willing to accept some change in their style, the lyrics are still as good as ever, and it may be worth taking a look."
3,Different,"If you are looking for another ""afterglow"", this isn't the one. It has some good songs (brown eyed girl, am radio, here we go again) but lacks the power driven guitar that made ""sparkle and fade"" ""world of noise"" and ""so much for the afterglow"" great. In general, a lot softer than the normal everclear but still enjoyable."
4,Everclear rocks!,"I have heard the first single and i can't wait to get this CD ,,,i have been a fan for years and sense ""So Much For The Afterglow"" i have been drewling over the next album."
5,Concept? Wonderful!,"Is it possible to wear out a CD? What an incredible disc! That's all that needs to be said. I could see this ""concept"" album actually being made into a movie. It's almost a script about one man's life; the influential years, the teens, the birth and death of love, and the spark of another. A very real, emotional album that we can all relate to. Don't get me wrong...the damn thing rocks!What incredible lyrics, too! I never thought ""So Much For the Afterglow"" could be topped by these guys...but I'm so glad to be proven wrong. I can't wait for the follow-up (Vol. 2) to be released soon."
5,Awesome Album,"This album speaks to me on so many different levels. It is a very personal album. Here We Go Again is the second cut, and it sets a very different tone than the first track, actually a better representation of the album as a whole. AM Radio, is fun and catchy, and the experience's are representative of the time - the 1970's. Brown Eyed Girl is not a bad cover, but I would rather hear their own music. My ultimate favorite cuts are: Otis Redding, Unemployed Boyfriend and finally best of all WONDERFUL - I can relate all too well to this track. I would highly recommend this album, but do yourself a favor and listen to the words to their music, they are so real."
3,The worst Everclear has done...,"Having said that, it's still way better than 95% of the crap that came out this year. Miles away from World of Noise and Sparkle and Fade, it continues the direction that the band was taking with So Much for the Afterglow. I only gave it three stars because I expect better from Everclear. I don't think that they sold out by any stretch of the imagination, I just was hoping for something harder. I'm really looking forward to the next disc. I want anger and screaming guitars, dammit!"
3,This is very painful for me!,"""So Much for the Afterglow"" still, to this very day, excites and astonishes me during every listen. But ""Songs From an American Movie Vol. I"" did very little to instill those same emotions. There are some good tracks on here, like the first track ""Songs From an American Movie Vol. I"", but it's to short, while the other great tune ""Unemployed Boyfriend"" (track 10) carries an annoying voice over during the begining and the end of the song. Yeah, ""Wonderful"" is good, but not wonderful. The problem with it is that it doesn't have the musical intesity to match it's lyrics, like ""Father of Mine"" did so... well, wonderfully! And the absolutely beautiful ""Annabella's Song"", while great on it's own, just refuses to fit on this c.d. comfortably. As a whole, I am dissapointed, and that hurts to say. I pray that Vol. II, released in the fall, is another masterpiece of rock and roll emotions."
2,Not Their Best Work,"If this work had come out early in Everclear's career, I doubt there would be an Everclear today. The songs with their new sound just don't work and the others just sound like so much rehashed material. Unemployed Boyfriend is destroyed by the annoying female narrative. Thrift Store Chair is a great song worthy of Everclear. Honeymoon Song, when was the last time you hit the ""skip button"" during an Everclear CD? Brown Eyed Girl...no reason for this one. Don't cover a song unless you can make it your own. AM Radio....how old are these guys? Now That it's Over another great song...the rest of the CD is neither good nor bad....just filler."
2,EXPECTED BETTER,"I really didn't enjoy this. I like the old-Everclear better when they were semi-country. Now they crossed into pop-rock and I don't think it works very well. They do have a couple meaningful songs on here,though. But am I the only one who noticed that ""Wonderful"" is a complete rip-off of Savage Garden's ""Truly madly Deeply?"" Every time one comes on the radio,I have to wait until they actually start singing before I can distinguish which song it is. If you like this kind of music,I recommend Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon."
1,An absolute betrayal,"I just bought...well actually it was on store credit...vol II at a used cd store. I like what I hear. Yes, it took me 4 years to even take a chance on an essentially free Everclear cd after this debacle. I was trying to remember if I pawned this curse of a cd off on some poor soul (current or soon to be enemy) or just tossed it out of the car window at high speed. I can't remember being more pissed off at a band. Pure garbage."
