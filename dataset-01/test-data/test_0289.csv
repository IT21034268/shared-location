4,XTcrew neck t shirt,Silky fabric makes this tight fitting t shirt a second skin.Washes well and hold up to wear and tear. A bit pricey but we have to pay for Calvin's name.
2,Shower arm diverter valve,"I spent weeks trying to find a 3 way diverter valve that would deliver high flow through each port.Kohler was the only supplier that could/would provide flow rate data based on various pressures, but their product was quite expensive.Finally found a high performance valve made by Cameco, model 37463.Just tested it to find that delivery through each port was quite high, and far better than any other that I tested."
5,Bad purchase. Great product that I didn't need,"After I bought and received this item I realized I didnt need it as the shower head I bought came with one. This one is well made out of good, heavy chromed brass. I am keeping it just in case something comes up."
3,Business Research Book,Book arrived later than I'd hoped. My class was 2 weeks into it and I ordered before the start of the class. This made it difficult for this class.
2,"Beautiful, but problematic","Two weeks after I received this bag, the front latch fell apart. There is a cheap grommet that holds the buckle in place, and once it fell out, I could no longer secure the latch.OTHER THAN THAT, however, I really, really LIKE this bag. It's a nice-looking rucksack that works just as well for work (I carry my computer in it to work) and play (I am taking it on a vacation to Washington later this month.)Hopefully, it can be fixed; if it didn't immediately fall apart, I would have rated this with five stars."
2,Very silly but occasionally amusing,"This movie, in the grand tradition of ""Austin Powers"" presents an irrestible agent cavorting comically. The twist is that the ""Zohan"" of the title played by Adam Sandler is an Israeli counter-terrorism agent trying to reinvent himself as a haridresser in Manhattan.It's very silly and occasionally very vulgar and tasteless and even more occasionally quite funny.The best thing for me was the Israeli rap music supplied by the great group ""Hadag Nachash."" Sandler's accent wavered from time to time. There are some hasrh depictions of Arabs.If you don't take it too seriously and have a liking for 6th grade sex jokes, this might be worth considering. Otherwise, not."
3,Not for everyone,"My girlfriend and I were supposed to watch Kung Fu panda but we went to the wrong theater so we stuck with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it seeing it was more of a movie made for men and a flexible sense of humor as there were some questionable sex scenes. As for my girlfriend, she is not a man and does not share the same humor so she did not enjoy as much as I did. If we were to combine our ratings I would give it a 4 and she a 2 for a average of 3.If you need a synopsis of the of the movie, there are plenty of reviews here that summarize."
1,Don't Bother With This Movie,"Adam Sandler laughs all the way to Fort Knox by making pathetic comedies devoid of characterization and style. The crudely bizarre ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" is specially designed for Sandler's fan base. Others need not apply. The art of film comedy remains dead and buried in Hollywood, with no resurrection in sight."
4,Don't Just Don't,"There is a lot of funny gags in the movie the best one (yes it was worth the $4 I spent for the flick) is Tutoro's training sequence first he climbs out of a bed of women, then cracks 2 eggs & 2 baby chicks are the glass, downs them, then he punches a variety of punching bags including a cow hung upside down he cowers behind his trainer as soon as the cow moos fun stuff. Not Sandler's worse not his best it just works."
1,Grade School Humor,"Usually I do not care if a comedy movie is historically or culturally accurate, but this film was so off that it became annoying (specifically details about Israel, the Palestinians, and the conflict.)I was impressed at the number of actors who were willing to appear throughout this production, though I suspect they did it for the money or because Adam Sandler wrote them some I.O.U.s.Basically, this film relied on grade school humor. Actually, let me retract that statement because grade school humor has more depth than this script. Does Adam Sandler have a buttock/anal fetish? If you see the film, you'll know why I asked this question.Avoid ""Zohan"" if you can..."
2,"SOME FUNNY MOMENTS, BUT............! 2 1/2 STARS!","I like Adam Sandler and most of his films, but every once and a while he makes a film that just doesn't have the magic. 'You Don't Mess With Zohan' is one from the latter category. The film is not without it's funny moments and the formula plot will keep most viewers happy, but it's a little long for such nonsense and not well paced.The potty humor didn't bother me, nor the racial humor, because I realize this is all done for fun. It's about time we all grew thicker skin and stopped criticizing a film every time they use a humorous stereotype.We all came from other countries at one time in our families history and we've all been the [...] of a joke, so lighten up folks....it's only a movie!"
3,Not great but touching....,"If you want to see a pleasant, silly and harmless movie in which Adam Sandler plays an extrememly sweet, kind, super-heroish isreali agent who really just wants to make people beautiful. I laughed sometimes, smiled more and was impressed with the compassion Mr.Sandler radiated off the screen.I think women may like this more than men, surprisingly. If you are looking for a pleasant, light couple of hours, rent this."
2,Not At All What I Expected,"When I first saw the trailer for Adam Sandler's ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan,"" I thought it would be a hilarious movie. Fortunately, I did not have the opportunity to see it in the theaters and recently rented it. I soon found out that all of the funny parts of the movie were in the trailer.""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" tells the story of Zohan, the perfect killing machine who dreams of becoming a Paul Mitchell hair stylist. Upon leaving his homeland, he ventures New York City to fulfill his dreams. After that, the film is filled with a lot of pelvic thrusting, nudity, and crudeness. I found myself fast-forwarding through much of the movie because I lost interest so quickly. The excessive bathroom humor may be fine for some people, but after a while, it just became annoying.My suggestion would be skip this movie altogether. You'll be happy you did."
1,You really have to enjoy stupidity,"I, like everyone, enjoy a good comedy but there comes a point when it just gets too stupid for me to finish watching it. This movie ""for me"" went beyond stupid. I shut it off after the first 15 minutes."
5,Possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen!,"Tasteless and trashy but hysterically funny! I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, but he plays such a difference character and I was so pleasantly surprised at how funny this movie was--hope you enjoy! Worth the money, for sure!"
3,Senseless Sandler Does It Again,"Not as bad as some reviews state, but not a great movie either. Funny moments to be sure. The problem is, the movie had a lot more potential that it didn't even attempt to reach. Sandler fans will enjoy this film, others will see it the same as most of his movies...senseless with little real humor. Sandler needs to mature and go back to making truly good films like Big Daddy. This could have been that good with less lame cameos and more humorous ""cross cultural banter""."
4,An excellent science fiction story,"Marque and Reprisal is a solid followup to the first book in the series (Trading in Danger). Accelerating quickly, you are breathlessly taken through a series of jarring, thrilling events. A wide variety of science fiction fans should enjoy this book. This series and setting hold great future promise.So, why four stars instead of five? This book had the action and plot to grab and keep your attention. What it seemed to lack a bit was the depth of characterization and development that I have come to expect from Moon's incredible talent. Her masterful work in other series has set high expectations. Then again, this is certainly a personal preference. Some may find too much depth gets in the way of the story for them. Another minor disappointment is a couple of the situations seemed a bit too contrived. Again, these are minor disappointments in an overall excellent book. I fully recommend it."
3,"Re: Altered Art: Techniques for Creating Altered Books, Boxes, and cards","It's okay, I already seen the majority of the techniques used in this book.....looking for something fresh....new!!!Still a very nicely laid out guide."
1,Never got them,"I ordered these a long time ago, and they never arrived.Do not order from this vendor."
5,Great,I got these to keep my darts from unscrewing and haven't had a problem since! Love it!I would definitely recommend to a friend!
2,Baroque Recorder,"I received the Yamaha Baroque Recorder. Other than looking really nice, I couldn't tell the difference between the sound it produces and the one I played off of when I was in elementary school (the plain beige colored Yamaha recorder). And I am currently a part time professional musician..I guess it only looks nicer and Made in Japan..."
2,It is just cream...,"It is a just cream. When I applied this one, but nothing happened...A little bit of dumb ... That's it. I don't recommend it."
4,Husqvarna Mulching Kit,The chute cover fit was a little tight and hard to install. The mulching blades and kit do work for mulching yard.
4,Great product for the price!,"The mulching kit was very easy to install and works quite well. The clippings from my lawn still tend to be ejected from the open side in spite of the cover being in place, but not nearly as much as without the cover. The blades seem to do a nice job of mulching leaves and grass clippings provided I set the deck height low enough (usually on the 3rd of 6 deck height settings). A note for those who have not used a mulching kit before - damp grass/leaves = poor mulching capability. Make sure you cut the grass when it's as dry as possible."
2,Disappointing -,"guess I'm spoiled with the personalization and detail of the Rick Steves and Rudy Maxa travel videos. The scenery was spectacular and the photography wondeful, I expected more."
5,WAITING FOR IT IN DVD,"I don't even have a VHS so hopefully it'll come out in DVD soon. I also remember this from a matinee when I was a kid. As it was a G rating it was the only thing my parents would let us watch. In spite of that, it was one of those movies that rang my bell, and still remember after all these years. I'd love to see it again. Fans of this movie might also like the book Sasha, My Friend (My Wolf, My Friend), 1969. Although, for something lighter and altogether science fiction try ""Lizard Music"" by Daniel Pinkwater (while we're on the subject of 'kid's books'). Anyway - I'm sufficiently off-topic - would just like to put in my vote for DVD release of this movie!"
4,Websters New World Dictionay,This is an excellent dictionary for middle school level students. My daughter who is 13 loves it.
4,nice exhaust.,just to help clear up any possible confusion. the product is labeled as slip on and full exhaust system when in reality it it just the slip ons.
1,"No ""soul"" in this book","Unlike the other reviewers of ""The Soul of the Law"" by Benjamin Sells, I could not read past a few pages of this book. I wanted to like it. The title and description sounded great and as a pre-law adviser, I'm always looking for good books about lawyers to recommend to my students. Unfortunately, I found it dense and boring and rather self-important. I tried reading the first pages of several chapters and just could not go any farther. Sorry, Mr. Sells, but this book had no ""soul"" for this reader."
5,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!","I am proud to be the owner of the original LP. I think this album should be ranked as ""Legendary."" It's a priceless album and I am tickled to hear that this has finally been reissued on CD! Way to go!"
5,"Great battery, still goings years later.",I have had this battery on my computer for years now before I am now getting around to leaving feedback. It is still going. Thanks
5,"Great battery, Great price","I have an HP Pavilion dv2000 and the battery I had was so bad that I had to leave my computer plugged in at all times or it would just die. I purchased the extended life (12 cell) battery (instead of the 6 cell) because at the time it was only about $20 more than the 6 cell and it states that it will last for hours. I have had it a little over a month -- and so far it's great. I can leave my computer unplugged and use it for hours- which I was never able to do with the original battery! Since it is thicker than the 6 cell, it elevates the laptop an inch or so which I think is a nice feature. I also like that it is a genuine HP battery and HP sells the same one on their website for about $150 before s&h. After I researched, I found that buying this battery through Amazon was the best choice, and so far I'm pleased with my purchase!"
5,Great replacement with more power,"As stated by others that rated this product, it does what advertised. It has more power and keeps the laptop going for a couple of hours...The larger than original drops into the battery slot with ease and with its double the size of the original battery really props up the laptap into a nice typing position and even helps keep the laptop nice and cool.So if you don't mind having the laptop sit up a little and are looking for battery life, this is the one...good bang for the buck"
1,Defective Battery,"I purchased this battery about 5 months ago and I was very happy with the capacity the battery provided. But, the battery is now dead and will not charge (I did everything my job's IT support said and it is definitely a defective battery). This is very frustrating! I would not buy from this company again! I could understand a battery going bad around the 1.5 - 2 year range but not within 6 months, especially when I am not on the battery very often."
1,no happy,"this battery does not fit dv6 series laptop, it says in description for HP Pavilion DV6000 DV2000 my laptop its a dv6, just got the battery and it wont fit to my laptop, returning it!"
5,"Was concerned, but it's exactly what I needed",Works well and holds the charge. Is the same extended battery as the one it's replacing. Where do I send my old battery? I never know where to chuck this stuff out.
5,High tech cell phone,The cell phone we received is perfectly fine. No problems of any kind and the price was very reasonable. Thank you.
1,Fatal Problem,"This phone has a major problem! It has no reset button! After I had it for 2 weeks, the phone locked up. Turning it off and removing the battery did no good. While it worked I really loved it, but how can I recommend it when there is no way to do a reset? Even at $89 this phone is too expensive!"
3,"Not a bad phone, but...","To make this a very brief review, it is all that the other reviews say, but to me the most salient points are:1) Even set at the highest volume the ringtone is almost inaudible. If you are in a restaurant or the street you probably won't hear it at all. If the phone is in the next room, you won't hear it ring. There is a vibrate mode, but it will only vibrate one time, and again you may miss it.2) The alarm clock mode will not work unless the phone is turned on. So you can't turn it off at bedtime and use it as an alarm clock.2) The keyboard is good and it is useful for instant messaging.3) The phone is solidly constructed.4) The phone has good reception and transmission in areas of weak signals.5) Being unlocked, you can use it with different SIM cards when traveling overseas."
1,It does not work,It sometimes get the calls and sometimes with out reason doesn't. I have to use my old phone instead.
5,good,it was an good transition i made over internet.got the phone on time and in good condition as described
4,A mathematically tight and well-motivated work,"Professor Bleecker has succeeded in writing a book for mathematicians and physicists. And, it's all there. I would rate this work 5-star, except I fear some physicists might find the mathematical format a bit tough (definition, theorem, lemma, etc.) As a mathematician studying physics I hope I am wrong. I find this book user-friendly due to its formality and ""compactness"". I caution those w/o a fair degree of mathematical acumen that this big, little book is a good deal more formal than, say, Gilmore's ""Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Some of their Applications."" But, then we all must bite the bullet. With effort, I think you will find this a chewable bullet."
3,A useful reference text for gauge theory.,"A useful reference text for gauge theory. While Bleecker includes an introductory chapter to cover prerequisites (tensor analysis, differential forms, Lie groups etc) the text assumes some familiarity with these techniques and gauge theory. The text is in the ""definition, theorem, proof"" format. Bleecker gives fairly detailed proofs which help the reader to follow most steps. The text is short and the price reasonable, so the absence of second quantization gauge potentials, for example, is perhaps understandable. While there are chapters on gauge invariance and Action density I found the material didn't go into the detail I was looking for on invariance problems (discussion of theorems of Noether, Caratheodory's methods, Lie algebras and groups). I rated this text lower because of the complete absence of exercises and the limited references and bibliography (about three pages in total)."
3,In Comparison,"The Campion series is entertaining. Allingham stories are creative and have great characters. However, I can't help comparing this series to Poirot or Miss Marple, and it doesn't come off well. I think the series was perhaps mis-cast. The two leads are good actors, but they aren't quite able to create characters so interesting that you make a point of watching the show. On the other hand, the casting for the parts in the individual stories is very good."
4,Interesting stories,We enjoy this series but find that we sometimes cannot understand his sidekick's Cockney accent. Sure wish they had closed captioning.
5,Excellent Period Mystery,"Excellent Period Mystery, not up to Agatha Christie, but enjoyable. I find that the mystery isn't what draws me to this series but how well done that the historical era is done."
5,Brilliant Interpretation of Margery Allingham's novels,"Peter Davison is Albert Campion to the life in this detailed representation of Margery Allinghams classic mysteries of the 1930s. The BBC has once again lived up to its formidable reputation. Acting is fabulous, sets and costumes word perfect and direction is tight.Such a shame there are only two box sets, produced in 1989 & 1990 respectively.It would have been good to see more of Albert and Amanda as portrayed in the later novels."
3,Noisy and garbled,"We enjoyed Peter davison in ""The last detective"", and expected the same good entertainment in this series. We were sadly disappointed. The background noise was totally distracting and caused us to miss most of the dialogue of the actors. In all four stories it was the same, except for a few instances..much to our relief!. Unfortunately, it was too little too late. We missed 85 % of this series due to noise! The exceptions to the noise was when Campion and his fellows mumbled through the scenes.We are still Peter Davison fans, but wonder at the directing of these stories"
2,An unhappy exception to the rule for BBC,"""BBC"" on the label has always seemed to be a mark of excellence for entertainment. Deep character development, sophisticated dialogue, novel but realistic plots, much better than average acting, and so on, have nearly always justified the price of admission. I found Campion to be an exception, however, on nearly every count. To the extent that the acting is good, it does not and cannot compensate for weaknesses elsewhere. My copy is going to the public library to sell to raise funds rather than to catalog for public circulation. For real private investigator/police entertainment with a British flair, try Foyle's War and A Touch of Frost, both of which I have reviewed. Cheers."
1,Amazon and TiVo aren't talking,"Despite following the instructions provided by both TiVo and Amazon Prime for setting up and linking my accounts, none of the ""Amazon Instant Video"" items claimed to be ""free"" to watch on all supported devices are accessible on my brand new TiVo Premiere box.And yes, TiVo Premiere is explicitly listed as a supported device, and [...] lists the device as being properly ""registered"".The imaginary ""TivoCast"" menu entry doesn't actually exist on the TiVo menu, and no download options are available at Amazon except for PURCHASED digital items costing $2.99 and up. Free? Forget it.So much for the big bait-and-switch con game by Amazon & TiVo to get suckers to buy in to Amazon Prime memberships.Don't fall for it. You have been warned. Two-sided finger-pointing game at both ends. A blames T, T blames A, round and round you go forever. If I could have given this *ZERO* stars, I would have."
2,I thought it was absolutely boring.,"My class first watched the movie with Dustin Hoffman and John Malcovich and I fell asleep, so I decided since we had to do an essay on the play, I'd read it. That did not work at all, it was no better than the movie. I ended up having my friend email me his essay so I could write mine!"
3,A Berserker Mystery!,"Why are the Berserkers suddenly NOT killing people? What are they up to? Sure, the book is a tad long, but when you realize Berserkers are fighting each other, you want to know WHY! The answer is worth the wait."
5,Shopping online,My grandson will be getting this for x-mas. I know he will spend many hours browsing and reading this CD. I can imagine his laughter and delight as he does this!!.
2,"No Bonus Material from Super Specials, etc.","I thought I would be able to ""retire"" my old seven-CD set, but I guess I won't be able to. As far as I can tell, this DVD version has none of the bonus material that came with the old ""More Trash From Mad,"" ""Mad Super Specials,"" etc, reprint collections. No reproductions of stickers, no PDF files of stuff that was bound into the collections, no music from flex-discs. I also can't find the paperback covers promised on the back of the DVD box...OR the ""stickers, posters, maps, postcards, labels and much more.""Sigh. Why couldn't this have been done RIGHT?"
2,Low resolution scans,"On the plus side, you have the full run of Mad up to 2005 on one DVD and you can copy the files to your HD and they'll work.On the negative side (and that's a BIG negative) the scan quality leaves a lot to be desired. If you were thinking of reading crisp pages of Mad on your large monitor, forget it. I had to enlarge the pages to 150% (or maybe more) to fill my 1280x768 display.I think the main reason the scans were made this small (apart from not wanting people to print the pages) is to make all the issues fit on one DVD."
4,Insight into state systems,"Those interested in history and IR theory, especially those with a constructivist bent, will find this book worth looking at, though it's not always easy going. The basic argument is that different dominant ideas about the ""moral purpose of the state,"" coupled with different ideas about sovereignty and justice, give rise to very different forms of diplomacy and law in different eras. Most interesting, though not necessarily completely persuasive, is the distinction Reus-Smit draws between the ""absolutist"" and the modern European state systems, emphasizing the shift from ""naturalist"" to ""contractual"" international law, and from ""old diplomacy"" to multilateralism."
3,hairy ipod,"Looks great, but the other reviewer is correct: It attracts all kinds of hair. Nothing more embarassing than having to pick off all manner of hairs from the new ipod when showing it to coworkers and friends.Maybe the other colors don't show the fuzz as much as this black model? Maybe fuzz is the new black?Anyway, if you buy this, just make sure it doesn't touch the carpet or the pet."
2,This book should have gotten lost....,"I too read this book in less than a day. This is the story of a missing 21 year old and her mother's quest to find her daugther no matter the consequences. Her daughter is a willful, spoiled and selfish would be actress who disappears after an audition. Her mother becomes a frantic neurotic in her search for her missing daughter. In the process, she ignores her other daugther, at one point even forgetting that she has one. Of course, it was easy to hate her missing daughter by page 10. But, by the end I found myself thinking I don't like the mother much either. I have never wished that a character was in my living room so that I could shake her as much as I did in this book. The bottom line is that this book is extremely forgettable. If you are a true fan of Joy Fielding pick it up from the library if you must. But, this book would never make it onto anyone's must have list."
1,A Cruel Joke,"This book should be titled, ""A Cruel Joke"", because that is exactly what it is. The writing was good and the story was okay until I was 5 pages from the ending to find out that the joke was really played on me for wasting my time."
1,Frantic,"The book's name should have been frantic - I was frantic the whole time so I guess I'd have to admit it was a good ride. It is about a ""lost"" child - a 21 year old disappears - story lots of interesting twists but the book kept me on edge and the end - which I had an inkling of - <it was the only thing that made sense> - was very unsatisfying. All in all, it was just pretty disturbing - she caught how a person might feel though - frantic! Yuck."
1,I wanted to crash my car,"I listened to this novel on CD. I was tempted to crash the car. A waste of time. The characters were weak, disappointing and ANNOYING as all hell. Avoid this book if you are a smart intelligent female."
4,From Out of Nowhere,"When this album came out, it was significant for a number of reasons. First, it showed that George was alive and well and still capable of capturing the old magic... it lost none of the classic Harrison wit that was so evident on his previous work... I personally like ""Wreck of the Hesperus"", ""Just For Today"", and of course, ""When We Was Fab"". Listening to this album, it's much harder to believe that George is gone."
1,Cheap but still not worth the money.,Have tried 2 packs of these bulbs in the same light - they are lucky to last more then a month each and I don't move or bumb the light. Not pleased with their life.
4,Would Recommend,"I got these as a gift and I love them! Store the steak knives upside down to preven them from dulling so quickly. Hand wash and dry quickly - remember, they are NOT stainless steel."
3,bobster eyewear,I love the skull emblem on the side.. the glasses were a little big but still wear them...
1,How can Amazon sell this?,"I was astonished Amazon is selling this item. As the previous review says this DVD is simply unwatchable; it was probably recorded off a very poor quality VHS tape. I stopped watching after a couple of minutes when I realised this quality was the same throughout the DVD. The irony is that you can only get a partial refund on DVDs that have been opened.This doesn't deserve even 1 star, stay away from this unwatchable DVD at all costs."
3,Good Movie,Saw this on the Hallmark channel years ago and it stuck with me. Happy to have found it on dvd and the price was definitely worth it. If you want to see the character and story that inspired Indiana Jones as well as a great performance from Patrick Swayze then look no further.
4,Great movie; well done,I purchased this movie when I bought the Librarian series of three. This movie reveals what a major difference a good producer and good acting can make in a production. I will be watching this over again and again.
1,Back to basics.,"Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of ""King Solomons Mines"". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic ""Prisoner Of Zenda"". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution."
4,Long but of interest,"Clearly, King Solomon's Mines is made for television. That's its main weakness. The movie, probably a miniseries, is drawn out to fill nearly 3 hours. It's never boring but it lacks the cleverness and frequent action of a movie like Raiders of the Lost Ark, the gold standard for such adventure yarns. The characters and plot are interesting enough to keep you viewing. Some of the characters like the evil African king and his witch doctor are surprisingly very good, if only minor roles. Patrick Swayze puts in a credible performance as do most of the supporting cast. The cinematography is generally very well done and some of the scenery is eye popping. A little more budget and we might have actually gotten a decent tour of the mine filled with traps, treasure, twists, turns, and wonderous sights. Alas, that's not really the payoff here. It's about the characters on the journey, not the journey itself."
4,Midnight Shifter's Delight,"I work midnight shifts and don't sleep well when it's not dark. My room is such that making it totally dark during the day is not practical.Prior to using this product I would only get about 4 hours of sleep before waking. With this mask, I slept a full 7 hours.It's very comfortable, even for side sleeping. I've only used ""flat"" sleep masks in the past and I've always hated how they constricted my eyes. This mask holds itself away from your eyes--I forget its there.A very useful product. I dinged it a star because it slid around on my face and it lets some light in near my nose. It's much better than anything I've tried, so I recommend it."
2,Good pictures ...Lousy batteries and Amazon return policy,"I am very disappointed with this camera's battery system. I have now been through Two easy share docks and two NiCad batteries and still cannot get a prolonged recharge on the batteries. Yes I followed the recommended full charge/discharge/recharge sequence in the beginning and still get a low battery signal when the dock says that it is fully charged. Apparently the battery itself is charged but the camera,for some reason, doesn't recognise this. (I took the battery to a camera shop and they tested the charge on the batteries.) Sometimes if I turn the camera off and then on after a few minutes, it will be OK. The unreliability is about to get me to give up and get another. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days ...."
4,Awesome Documentary of our Beloved Aguilas,"This DVD chronicles the history of Club America since it's creation in 1916, and is full of great interviews of players from Carlos Reinoso to Zague, and Cuauhtemoc Blanco. If you want to know where our club came from, their victories and defeats over the decades, then this DVD is for you. For those of you that remember the 70s and the glorious 80s where our club won nearly every tournament, this video will sure bring back memories. The only reason that I gave this video 4 stars and not 5 is because its somewhat old. It only covers America's history up to the mid 90s. It would be nice if Televisa put out a new, revamped DVD for the 90th anniversary or maybe for the 100th anniversary in 2016.All in all this is a wonderful video that is sure to please any America fan."
2,not one of her best,I have read all of Patricia Cabot's books and found this one the least entertaining. The characters were immature and silly and I didn't like either of them. If you are looking for entertainment and characters you want to cheer for I highly recommend her two other books.
5,liquid moly,Was recommended to me and absolutely love the results that I am getting from taking it daily. It is flavorless.
5,True Love,This is the best book. She's sweet and innocent but still has fire. He's rough and tough but still gentle and loving. If you like Diana's books this is a treat.
5,The New Moosewood Cookbook,"For anyone that chooses to eat good wholesome foods this book will give/inspire many ideas. Besides being a collection of recipes it also provides incite into what some of the more obscure items called for are. Also telling how and where to purchase them, or what to substitute.You do not have to be a vegetarian to not always eat meat."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I loved the first (1970s) edition of this cookbook, just as I do Mollie Katzen's other books, and those by the Moosewood Collective. Unfortunately, however, everything I tried from this book was a poor imitation of the version in the first book (and many were grossly inedible). If you want a good, healthy vegetarian book, I recommend those by Martha Rose Schulman (I've never had a failure with any of her recipes; even the fat-free, salt-free are okay), or Moosewood's Low-Fat Favorites (which vary in quality; some are wonderful and other's mediocre, but none were this bad)"
3,"Good drawer, as long as they don't lock the keys in it","I've bought two of these so far. The first one was great. It is well made, went in easily, is very sturdy, and rolls out smoothly. The second came in slightly bent, and was difficult to get in the rack. What's worse is that they locked the keys inside the drawer! Even worse than that, the key I had for the first drawer does not fit the second drawer. Luckily, there was enough play in the lock that I could pull the key out through the space between the front of the drawer and the housing.Overall, it's a good buy, but open quickly and make sure yours is in good shape so you can return it if you get a bad one."
5,to the guy who said radiohead doesnt sell lots of records...,"pablo honey, the bends, ok computer and kid a have all gone plantium (1,000,000 copies sold). amnesiac and hail to the thief have gone gold (500,000 copies sold). meeting people is easy dvd has gone platinum. and the seven television commercials dvd has gone gold. and these figures are from sales in the united states alone. lets not underestimate our boys. bodysong is on a major label because radiohead is one of the greatest bands of all time, and because jonny greenwood is one hell of a composer."
5,"21st century Ummagumma, yet much darker","There's probably nothing you can do to imagine how this album sounds, except of course seeing the film. Jonny has managed to play around with flirtacious melodies, fragmented movements, and chaotic rhythms to create 45 minutes of tense, dark and somewhat spiritual music. It's sort of a string quartet, jazz ensemble, and electronic stir fry. If you praise creative music, then you must give this album a shot."
1,The Devil Is in the Details,"...they say and the details here are devilish indeed. The set screw, located at the bottom and difficult to see, is about 1/32 of an inch across. But it hardly matters, because if there is a way that this will actually mount to the wall, I couldn't figure it out in 3 attempts. Visitors dragged into the problem had no better luck. Save your money and more important, save your time and temper."
5,This CD could have been perfect.,"Finally!I now have an Eddie Rabbitt CD with ""Any which way but loose"" on it. But to make this Good compilation CD a Great CD would have been to include the song "" Step by Step"". How in the world was that left off this record! This CD was almost perfect."
4,"Good book, practical advice for people in business not just programmers","I enjoyed the book, I thought it gave very good ideas on how to succeed. HIs motto is if you cant beat them join them. So, he developed a business that works and train workers that are outsourcing.I like the idea of becoming an expert,write a book, give lectures, teach a class, start a blog , anything to get your name out there.Also, I like the idea of learning one new thing for a month, and working like there are deadlines even if you put them on yourself.One concept that got my attention was how much money is your work contributing to the work area and does that match your salary.Overall , I like the book. I think we did add some fluff, but I really enjoyed the personal experiences , he described."
2,THIS IS NOT A PAIR OF TRIANGLES!,Nothing wrong with the triangle but does not specify wether it is a pair of triangles or a single triangle. Package arrived with only one triangle.
5,"A Victorian moon fantasy, a fine H G Wells novel","This is a wonderful Victorian moon fantasy, as good as the short stories, one of the essential works of the era. Like Dr Moreau it is beautifully crafted. I don't usually like novels (unless Evelyn Waugh does them) but this one certainly fulfills its length and justifies the form. H G Wells inspired science fiction with works like this, but he is a classic author and exceeds the genre."
4,Ambivalent,"Lucy Calkins is generally a good writer with her heart and skills in the right place. This book is solid and helpful. I'm glad the professor in question assigned it, because it has helped...I'm sorry though that there is so much emphasis on evaluative testing that the need for this book will keep it and related volumes in print for the next 2,000,000 years.I just finished my second advanced degree (in Education) and I've found this little tome to be useful.My suggestion: repeal NCLB and let the teachers (who are, after all, the experts about teaching) be in charge of curriculum again and to heck with mandated assessments.Still, as long as there are those kinds of tests, this is the book to have."
3,syrup,I probably would not buy this again. Not what I expected. My out of town company did not care for it either.
3,Showcase for Natalie,"The plot -- if you can call it a plot -- is chaotic. The visual special effects are right out of the 1950's. Fans of Ashley Judd will want their money back; we see more of Wal-Mart than of Ashley.But this film gives us many warm, touching scenes along with a gushy and improbable happy ending. And most of all it gives us Natalie Portman, surely the prettiest young thing of the season. When Miss Portman is on the screen, the story's banality and the production's general haphazardness don't really seem to matter. One even suspects that Portman is a competent actress, although she couldn't prove it with the script she's given here."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A pleasant enough movie but not an especially good one, Where the Heart Is suffers from the fact that it feels rather episodic in nature and many of its occurences defy belief (a woman living in Walmart with no one noticing, Forny jumping through glass as she delivers her baby, etc.); you may enjoy WtHI but I doubt you'll come away impressed."
3,Sweet but inacurate,"I read the book Where The Heart Is not too long before I saw the movie and the movie is entertaining and enjoyabloe but it doe not remain true to the facts in the book. My advice is read the book before you watch the movie because it will help you to understand it better and let me tell you, the book is awesome."
5,Fantastic!,"I thought this movie was so Good!it had a familiar tone to it like a modern day wizard of Oz it is definetly a Must See!I can't wait to own it myself.All performances from Ashley Judd,Natalie Portman,Stockard Channing,and Sally Field were well done and quite entertaining."
4,great friendship movie,I thought this was a very good movie. I loved how the friendships in the movie were so close and everything turns out how it is supposed to. it's a good movie to watch anytime again and again!
4,chick flick heaven,this is a good chick flick. queen amidala plays a pregnant girl that gets left at the walmart by her boyfriend. she lives in the walmart for six weeks and gives birth there. then a series of ppl befriend her and become her family. theres a happy ending. good one to watch when youre sick on the couch.
1,repulsive redneck fairy tale,"Couldn't sit through all of this. Awful pastiche of southern gothic stereotypes and a chick flick. This film made me hate Wal Mart even more. After the creepy childbirth scene, I was ready to turn it off."
1,Movie,"I thought this movie was going to be good but it went all over the place and made no sense at all, I couldn't even finish watching it. It was that bad."
3,Charming,"Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd make a great team of women fighting for what's right. Another Hollywood movie with the stereotypical happy ending, but my favorite recent Natalie Portman film [definitely not including the Professional and Beautiful Girls] A charming movie with good music. Watch it and see if you can catch the huge picture of Queen Amidala aka Natalie Portman's character in Star Wars, in the background."
4,Enjoyable Light Read,"This was a lighthearted, very enjoyable little mystery. The characters were likable, and the pacing was good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because occasionally some of the events made me think, ""That wouldn't have really happened that way."" One thing that I especially appreciated is that there were no glaring editing errors in the free ebook. I actually liked this book well enough that I bought the next book in the series."
3,Ok Read,"This book was just ok. I have liked Ginny Aiken books in the past, and although this wasn't horrible I struggled to get through it...kind of hoping that I was towards the end.The main character was kind of a ninny, and it is explained later in the book why she hates cops and men. But it just seemed to drag. The same conversations over and over.I would have rated it a 2 or 2-1/2 stars, but I didn't find it detestable, and did find the whodunit part interesting to figure out."
1,Design on a Crime,"This could have been a good mystery however as the book went on it became more and more of a religious rant. I found myself skipping sentences, then paragraphs and finally pages of preaching, finding God, accepting God as your saviour, etc. It was so in your face that it became offensive. Never again."
1,Not interesting,"I am an avid reader and I thought the premise of this book was right up my alley. The plot itself had promise and I really tried to continue reading the book, but I ended up stopping mid way (which is not something I do!) I found the book predictable and difficult to really get into. I didn't care for the characters and their relationships weren't built enough to care. Wish I could've liked the book but all in all I'm glad it was free!"
1,absolutely terrible,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. Everything about it was terrible - character development, thin plot, 4th rate writing style, constant blathering about heroine's feelings of desertion by God, rushed ending, etc. On second thought, the rushed ending was a blessing because it got me out of this torture sooner. Don't waste your time."
1,Another religious book,I should have read the reviews first. Too much religion for me. I wish the synopsis stated a little more about the book.
2,Disappointing read,"This book reads like a too-long advertisement for Starbucks and God (in that order). I'm greatly annoyed by books that have a decidedly proselytizing bent and do not clearly identify themselves as such in the product description. Beyond this though, the book wasn't really enjoyable. The main character was a self-absorbed doormat and the people around her were caricatures. There really wasn't a mystery to solve along the way to keep the reader's interest. Just a lot of whining from the main character and then the wrap up. Definitely won't be picking up anything else in this series or by this author."
4,Safety First,These glasses are very clear and comfortable to wear. I use mine whenever I mow or trim the lawn. I sometimes forget they are on and keep wearing them all afternoon. A very inexpensive way to protect your eyes.
5,Good for class!,"I ordered these glasses because the old-school, construction-style goggles I was using for labs were giving me problems by fogging up and leaving red marks of my face. These lightweight, compact glasses were the perfect solution. They fit well (on my relitively large head), don't fog up, and look pretty good too. It is almost as if I were not wearing any goggles sometimes. I would recomend these as a good value for students who want to be confotable during labs."
5,Buy this knife,"This knife has a sharp well balanced blade. The handle has a comfortable grip and is usable even when wet. I also own the 3.5 inch version of this knife (paring knife I think). Not too expensive, and holds up well to repeated use and washing."
5,Happily submitted feedback.,Completely Satisfied with these dvd's and have been using them every evening with a neighbor. Shipping was expedient and product was packed well protected. Thank you. I am looking forward to other products in same category.
1,Loose dog!,"I bought this collar for a large dog. (120#) Chasing a squirrel in the park and coming to the end of the lead, the abrupt stop can jerk the steel ring up over the release tabs and voila! loose dog! Not something you want to have happen around traffic or people who are afraid of dogs."
2,Whoops! It won't record DVDs!,"I bought this because I thought it would help convert my VHS tapes to DVD. I doesn't! It only records on VHS, it won't write DVDs. Don't make the same mistake. I'm sure it's a good unit, but it may not do what you are looking for."
2,HDMI port not working,"Product is Ok, Huge disappointed to find out HDMI port is not sending signal out."
2,Not built to last,"This is the first of this type device that didn't last but just over a year. Very poor return on investment. The DVD would usually kick it out with message ""cannot play disc, please remove."" So I bought this to give the Playstation 2 a rest from playing DVDs but at least that always played them. I would not recommend this to anyone if you want one that lasts and plays DVDs for you. It now has completely stopped working, I think I bought this in January of 2007. Wow bummer."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"Maybe I happened to get a ""lemon"", folks, but my unit was JUNK! Brand-new unit --- right outta the box as it was shipped to me from Sears --- yet it damaged (scratched and creased) the one tape I loaded into it, it balked (ground and squealed, scratched and creased the tape) wherever there was a slightly worn/damaged section of tape, whereas other VCRs sailed right on through those spots, no problem. And it didn't automatically reverse at the end of the tape, either --- it just sat there and ground and ground till it finally shut off, and then it wouldn't do a thing (rewind, fast-forward, play, etc.) till I actually ejected the cassette (and I saw that the end of the tape had been scratched and creased by the machine while it was sitting there grinding instead of automatically reversing and rewinding as it was supposed to) and then re-inserted it. I was actually afraid to try any more tapes in it for fear it would damage them, too! I took the unit back to Sears the next day."
4,Samsung DVD-VCR Combo,"For the price ,I recommend it. Great little product. I sure wish America could still build em like this for this price. At this point I could start talking about lawyers and unions but lets stick to this product. America can't build em, and Samsung can. They make a great flat panel tv also. I recommend this Samsung product."
5,Great Knife,"This knife was originally found in a rental property in the Cayman Island's. I loved it so much, I wrote down the info I could re it and came home to find one! I was not able to find one in any store but did find it on Amazon. Have ordered several!"
3,Nice synth remixes of scifi classics,"Koto-bass meets spacey scifi themes - one's dream has come true? Generally I like the remakes on the album, Koto has added some extra Koto'ish touches while keeping the feel of the originals.However, I was very disappointed when I heard the Koto's version of 'MacGyver theme' for the first time. Why did they change those famous chord stabs?! Now it sounds completely wrong.Fortunately most of the other songs on the album remain pretty faithful to the originals. I was delighted to find out that Koto covered some music of John Carpenter. Koto's style fits perfectly into the dark mood of the Carpenter's originals. My favorite track of the album is 'Twilight Zone'. It's funking fantastic - Koto has really beefed up the original theme. Some of the tracks on the album don't have the power of the originals. 'Terminator', for instance, sounds very thin but as long as the koto-bass keeps rolling I won't complain."
3,It's okay,It was a lot larger than I expected it to be. (Based on photograph) Other than that no problems
2,GI boards review; poor resource,"I'm a radiology resident using the Case Review series to study for the radiology boards. While the rest of the series is pretty good, this one is not. When I've had questions regarding the cases, I'd take them in to have my attendings clarify concepts and so far they have all said that whichever case I was reviewing with them was a bad example, with poor pictures and poor explanation of the concept involved. My fellow residents and attendings recommend the Mayo Clinic GI review."
1,Avoid this book,"The worst of the series. 200 cases are listed but many are repeats from earlier in the book. The questions seem random and are not always related to the case presented. Images are suboptimal, for example many of the CT images are coronal without axial images provided. What do you think you are more likely to see on boards, coronal or axial images? You are much better using Mayo Clinic GI imaging review."
2,Thick and ugly,"This book was required for our DSS class. The material is impossibly thick and it can take hours to try to sort through the material.Ok coverage, but you can do a heck of a lot better elsewhere"
2,Egocentric fluff,"This book contains many empty references to other works, which indicate that the author(s) are well read, but does not help the reader at all (how many books does the author expect you to buy?). A lot of writing on each page, but little actual information. If you are looking for a book on how to actually implement a DSS, look elsewhere."
1,door stop material,"When you're done with the millions of words and pounds of ink and paper, you can use this book as a door stop, or a paper weight, or even a boat anchor.You could cut out two-thirds of the verbosity in this book without any sacrifice in content. There certainly must be a better sytems book out there."
2,Disappointing. So much potential.,"Such a great plot concept. The execution was very junior varsity. Countless spelling and grammar mistakes. For example, one character drives a Camaro, but in the book its constantly written as ""Camero."" Also, aerospace company McDonnell Douglas is constantly referred to as ""MacDonell Douglas."" For a book that is trying to authoritatively discuss ""what if"" Nixon kept Apollo going etc. etc. , to constantly make spelling errors, forget words where needed etc. etc.- works to undermine the entire story.The characters are cartoonish. From the Soviets, to Nixon, to liberal peaceniks, to the astronauts - all coming off like a parody.There are glimpses of excitement and interesting plotlines, but the junior varsity nature of the writing quickly diminishes it..."
1,Misleading descriprion,"I agree with Wall-E. Even The big title says 4 pack, Not 4 bulbs.BE CAREFUL! Intentionally misleading.It's not 4 packs, it's only 4 bulbs!!!! (1 pack)!!!"
4,Good with continued use,I really like the Pca line and notice the difference within days of using their serums specially with the size of my pores. The only problem is that you have to continue using them and it can get expensive (even though a little goes a long way the serums usually last me months). As soon as I stop using the serums my acne comes back my pores look larger etc...but they work and they work great while you use them specially when you combine them with some of their other products.
5,Great serum,I really enjoy the feel of this serum on my skin. I use it twice a day and think it makes a difference.
5,Bully cordless is great,"Lightweight, easy to use, excellent battery life, and a clean alternative to gas powered mowers. This is my third electric lawn mower, and the best so far."
4,Good for me,"I'm very happy with this mower. It arrived quickly and was completely assembled. I haven't seen it run out of battery power yet, but my yards are pretty small. I love the collapsible handle. The deck height adjust is tight but I'll probably never adjust it again so it's no big deal."
1,Bully only runs for ten minutes,"Re the Bully--After charging for 48 hours, the Bully lasted 10 minutes, then lost all charge and never worked again. Called the number on the mower (the literature it comes with says to call one of ""our authorized service reps""--but no list. and no phone numbers or addresses stated ANYWHERE on the literature) and was sent another mower which arrive within a week. We cut about 2/3 of our small yard (after charging for DAYS). This second mower died and never would charge again. We called the number on the mower (different number than was on the first mower!) and never received a call back. We have had to cancel payment via our credit card company. THE BULLY IS A RIP OFF. AMAZON SHOULD NOT CARRY IT.I just finished using a friend's Neutron and it is far far superior! But 50% pricier."
1,Do not buy this mower,"After going through 2 of these mowers (one was a replacement for the first), I would not recommend it to anyone. The first mower stopped working after a couple of uses. Even with the few times I used it, my entire lawn (and it's not big) was not mowed. OMyGarden sent me a replacement and after charging, it went on and turned off. I couldn't get it to work again. OMyGarden offered to replace it again, claiming it was a faulty motherboard. I declined and received a refund from Amazon (which was not all that easy either). The concept is great but the mower needs some work before it can be worth the buy."
2,I would not suggest this item,"Received the product as described. Great job Amazon. I purchased this for the lightness and versatility, as I was using it to maintain the cemetary. I wanted something that was lightweight for easy loading into an SUV. On the first use, the wheel fell off. I put that back on, and putting it away, folding the handle down, the bolt broke. I was sent a replacement bold with no problem. The number listed on the mower itself did not work. Another number located, put me in touch with ""O My Garden"", who sent me the bolt. On the second use, it now will not turn off. The handle controls no longer work. Once the switch is turned on, on the side of the battery area, it is running. This is going back to Amazon. They are excellenat to deal with, but they should get rid of this line. It is not equal to their way of doing business..."
5,Monster Squad Rocks!,"I saw this movie in the 80's and loved it . It brings back all those classic horror monsters you would have seen in the old movies . Has a lot of humor but might frighten young children. If you like ""The Goonies"" or any of the cheesy movies from the 80's, you will love this one!"
4,Finally!,My son is 25 and has been wanting to watch this movie with his son (7) for the longest time. I almost was going to buy the VHS version; but kept hoping it would be available on DVD. Thank you to everyone who has made this possible!
4,Great reminder of my child hood days...,"Bought the movie to re-visit my teen age years, It's great fun for the kids even today's kids..."
4,My now teenager remembers this movie was great,"There are two all time favorites. Goonies and Monster Squad. Enough said. Now I've moved on to Chris Farley movies. Favorite sceen with the exception of the ""kick him in the nards"" has got to be the look on the mummies face when he is hanging of the back of the pick-up and then starts unravelling. Bring this movie back so my friends and little brother can see it"
4,The Monster Squad blu-ray,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very cute to me. I'm sure that young adults will enjoy this movie.
5,Wolfman's got nards!!,"Oh man, I can't WAIT for this movie to be released! I had the old VHS, an old movie poster, and just about every single article on Monster Squad! I was a HUGE Andre Gower fan and absolutely loved this movie! I still can't believe they changed the movie cover but it's really not that bad.They didnt list the main actors from the movie though on this Amazon page which was kind of surprising...Andre Gower,Robby Kiger,Stephen Macht,Duncan Regehr,Tom Noonan,Brent Chalem,Ryan Lambert,Ashley Bank,Michael FaustinoDaym, 20 years....definately going to be a classic horror film!"
5,Nostalgic Flick highly recommended,Very well made family monster Movie with a slightly disappointing climactic ending. The final scenes were a bit forced and seemed to be tacked-on with a dwindled budget. Starts out great. Gradually loses momentum. Still a notch above other similar efforts.
3,Yamaha YRT-304B 3 Piece Tenor Recorder - Baroque,The material of the recorder is quiet good. It is a good instrument and there is enough information on the internet.
4,NIce recorder!,Bought it for my 10 year old son. It was a little bit large for him - meaning the spacing of the holes were a little difficult for him to reach to play the quicker songs.But he LOVED it and will grow into it.
4,Great knife for the right price,"I purchased this knife based on the reviews and I have not been disappointed. It quickly replaced my other knives and is my #1 go to knife. It is very sharp and the grip handle is perfect. In all honesty, I have purchased expensive knives in the past and they have not lived up to their reputation."
3,Fun for my son,This was a present for my son and he seems to love the game. He is very into racing and monster trucks so this game was right up his alley!
1,NOT GOOD !,"well as soon as i opened the box disappointment. #1 the main hull is slit lengthwise down the middle.this gives the finished result a line where one doesn't belong.It took me a bit before I realized the picture on the box is the real car,so beware.also the decks were the tail lights sit are part of the rear fender not the boattail giving it two more lines were thay do not belong.If thay wanted to create more glueing thay could have made the doors and hatch cover for the top separate pieces.Mine came missing all the glass,but i was able to make my own headlights and windshield.You will have to paint the white walls,and the windshield frame doesn't have the sideview mirrors.In my opinion the 1935 Auburn boattail speedster is the most beautiful car ever made.this model doesn't do it justice.I guess I will buy a pre-made diecast model to put on display."
2,What a great title for a book...,"Too bad the title was wasted on this one. Don't bother reading this unless you want to read long, drawn-out exposition of efforts at preserving various farms and wilderness in the New England states and buildings and parks in NYC. The research was light, no real thesis put forth - some garble about ""simultaneous perception"" that's forgotten after the first chapters hardly counts. It's not that the writing is offensive, but it is a bit boring and provincial, and lacking in unity and focus."
5,Great Book,"I got exactly everything I wanted from the book, had very a simple easy to understand path towards making games for linux, started small and covered all the topics that I was interested in. This is more of a entry book, and a good reference but it doesnt go to deep into some topics 3d gfx, physics but a great book nonetheless."
5,Student Solutions manual,"This was a good product, and I recieved it quicker then was expected. Overall, a good experience from this seller."
3,Delayed Shipping,"My order was placed on October 14th; however, the item I ordered was shipped out on October 20th. The instructions state that items should be shipped out within 2 business days. Being a seller, myself, I always make sure that I ship the same day if possible, or the next day. Also, the description of the condition of the book was too vague and the book turned out to be in worse condition than I expected."
2,pointless,"The villain had no motive to commit his crimes. At least, the director chose not to reveal what it was. This movie was an utter waste of time. Sean Young is pretty, but too thin in this film. She looked far better in ""Ace Ventura."""
2,Disappointing erotic thriller,"There are erotic thrillers that succeed in their genre (e.g. Basic Instinct, Jade), but this one felt awkward and contrived. I think its producers were trying to ride on the coat tails of the immensely popular Basic Instinct by attracting some of that audience. I know that's why I and friends went to see it in theatres. But we were disappointed, both in the story and the acting.I think Sean Young is very attractive, from the first time I saw her in Dune and then in No Way Out, but her nude scenes in this film were embarrassing. I agree with someone else who said her proportions were much better in Ace Ventura and, I might add, Dr. Jeckyll and Ms. Hyde. She may have had some work done.I admit I haven't yet seen the unrated version so it might change my opinions."
5,Speedo bathing cap,I received this bathing cap soon after ordered and it is exactly as described. I would use this vendor again.
5,Perfect fit,"My hair is not very ""long"" but I usually wear it in a bun and this cap fit over it perfectly."
1,chica,I needed to keep my long hair dry so I purchased this silicone speedo. What a mistake.It flew off my head like a missile. I had to keep pulling it back down onto my head. It is too tight also. I have had all kinds of caps but this one will have to go back.Maybe my head is too big I should of listened to the review that said the best cap has a ribbed edge all around. It would stay in place.
4,really works,I was really surprised by this head cap. I wear my hair in locks and was really skeptical about whether this would be able to accommodate my hair especially when they are up. I stayed about 2 hours in the ocean and at least 90% of my hair was dry. It started slipping off in the front and my hair line got wet but that was it. I will order another one as back up.
2,Not a great fit,"I have a large head and long hair. This cap can't handle both. If anyone has found a cap that will, please let me know."
4,Worth the buy,My hair is extremely long and think. This swim cap worked great for my high school swim class. Thumbs up!
5,Great cap,This is the best cap I have ever had.I swim laps and it stays on perfectly. Also it is easy to put on.
3,"cap fits ok, but not the one in the picture","I have long fine hair, and the cap does allow enough room for it to fit underneath. It is not very comfortable on my head though, and is not the cap in the picture--it's a different shape, and different from one I bought previously (was supposed to be the same style)."
3,Perfect Fit,"My hair is not that long, but is up to my shoulder blades--an this cap actually fits. All of my hair fits inside and there is very little seepage. Only my edges get a little wet."
1,Bathing cap doesn't do its job,"I swim several times a week and have thick long hair. I wanted a swim cap that would keep my hair out of my face, piled on top of my head, or slightly in back. This cap does not fit with my hair and it's quite uncomfortable. Last, the product is not returnable."
1,If they only had minus reviews,"I have very thick long hair and as I placed the cap over my head (1st time out of the package) the cap ripped!Material looks great, feels nice, but failed terribly - waste of money!"
2,Too small,"I have a larger head and long, fine hair and I found this uncomfortably tight. I know they are supposed to be snug, but I found it unwearable. I returned it."
2,Large but not enough to keep hair dry,"In my continuing quest to find a cap that fits my large head and keeps my thick hair dry, I bought this (along with speedo bubble cap). It takes all my hair, but my hair still gets completely soaked. You might as well wear a lycra cap."
5,The greatest belt I have ever owned,"This belt is awesome, It is functional and will last a long time and wont crack or wear away like other materials will. It also is a great conversation starter, and if you're a guy, it will get the ladies to notice you're special place ;)"
5,Deeply Satisfying. Glad I bought it!,"I use this amazing deck to do massage all the time, and have benefited from nearly every one of the routines personally as well. Massage as presented here is very enjoyable and not at all difficult to master. I have also given this as a gift. It's very well made and gets noticed--and put to work, often on me, personally!Good stuff!"
4,Best of the Bunch!,"I recommend ""Mexico"" Mike Nelson's latest edition as the best of the books now out on relocating to Mexico. His advice is clear, concise, and wide-ranging, and his writing style is engaging. In addition, for an extremely reasonable rate, Mike can be contacted via phone or email at the numbers provided in the book, and I can vouch that he gives useful, creative, and up-to-the-minute advice for those miscellaneous but nonetheless important questions that come to mind as one prepares for the move.If you are thinking about or planning on moving to Mexico, get a copy right away!"
4,Heavy Gauge Structural Add-ons for your Tower of Power,These vents are constructed with purpose providing great additional rigidity because of the rolled lip construction. They are finished with a tuff coating that will stand the rigors of component reconfigurations. The vertical slates provide good visual masking of wiring along with some degree of sound attenuation and they also exhibit good ventilation characteristics. These can provide reliable additional protection of road abused rack setups. They can also serve in server rack configurations.
5,The absolute best for your money.,"These are easily the best headphones I've owned. I just got them today, so I don't know how long they will last, but even if they wear out this month it's only a matter of about $14 to get another pair. The sound quality is awesome. It blows my mind to think Apple sells their mediocre headphones for twice the price of these.My first impression was that they are probably bigger than most headphones I've seen. I was worried they would stick out of my ears and look silly, but this is not the case. After I started listening to my music with them, I was hooked. I am so glad I purchased these."
3,Paperback,I was expecting a hard back. The content is good. I wanted to give this book as a. Gift to a Hemingway lover.
2,"A good book if all you want is facts, but it was a chore to finish.","Maybe I went in with unrealistic expectations. Tillman's writing style is very dry and dare I say it, boring. That may be due to his subject matter. I can't fault the awesome compilation of facts and detailed information here. It's obvious he researched the subject thoroughly, but I wish his writing was more kinetic and lively in nature. For example, I like the presentation of 'Flags of our Fathers' and 'A Bridge Too Far' much better than this. And, as other reviewers have suggested, battle maps would have been a huge plus."
1,Could not even read the first half of the book,"Mr. Tillman, I feel is the Daniel Steele of world war two books. Please Mr Tillman if have only been able to finish one of your books and then it was only because it was so bad it was like not being able to look away from a car accident. I feel that I would walk away with a better understanding watching the History channel, which is what I feel he based this book on and it is merely a novelization of that."
1,"Wow - absolutely unreadable, even for Bolo lovers.","Gosh...I love me some Bolos. Have read 5 or 10 other Bolo books, and liked them all. Absolutely could not get through this one. I can't even think of another book that I couldn't stand long enough to finish...usually am able to plow through to the end ""just to see what happens,"" but I just couldn't stomach this.The authors convinced me right away that the bad guys were really bad. Super bad. Like, Darth Vader bad. But the book is 750 pages long. 750 pages that do nothing bad hammer in that point, over and over again, while the only ""normal"" characters try to understand ""How can they be so bad? How can they do these things?"" After about thirty pages of bad things, I didn't CARE why the bad guys were doing them. It's a Bolo book! Just fracking SHOOT them, already!"
4,A more mature book than his previous offerings,"John Ringo is certainly making a name for himself in the SciFi category.I have long been a fan of the 'Bolo' series created by Keith Laumer. This novel is a worthy addition to the series. Mr Ringo's writing is much improved from the 'competent, but flat' style used in his first novel ""Hymn Before Battle"". His characterizations are more vibrant, his conversations more realistic.This novel is certainly very timely, given the current focus on 'collateral damage' in military actions. While he does tend to be a bit preachy at times, it is well concealed by an intricate plot and interesting characters. At it's heart, this is a book about duty. While the battle scenes are as good as anything he has previously done, the focus is on the personal costs to his characters of doing their duty and maintaining their honor.I always look forward to Mr Ringo's offerings, and this one certainly did NOT disappoint."
4,Cute toy! 3 year old loves it!,"My 3 year old just received this for her birthday, really cute folds up to take along, has learning fun! I just wish it did a bit more for the money. But shes loves it!"
5,And....Cut!,All knives feel well balanced and are super sharp. Was concerned at first with the non serrated steak knives however they have performed very well. Expecting many years of service from this quality set.
3,Good critique of Dispensationalism but wrong alternative,"The authors do a great job of pointing out how critics of Reconstructionist theology misrepresent it. Unfortunately thay also betray the materialistic nature of their own Postmillenial world-view. They reason that Christians will dominate in the future since God blesses Covenant keepers and curses covenant breakers. They take prosperity to be a blessing (when it often is a curse) and forget that Christ said ""Blessed are they who mourn, are persecuted, reviled, are poor, etc."" Their postmillenial thought is just as Utopian as the Dispensationalism they criticize."
4,Pratchet's second best star: DEATH,"Yeah, apart from Rincewind (who makes a brief guest star appearance in ""Mort""), Death is the most hilarious character out from Pratchett's factory. The only flaw to the book is that lack of attention that makes some jokes appear redundantly many times, even in the same book."
4,Excellent book,"Death is so cool! Of course, it's not all about Mort and love and stuff, but mostly because Mort makes a mistake in reality that he has to fix. And Death takes a vacation now that Mort's doing most of THE DUTY, as Death calls it. He goes to parties, gambles, gets drunk, and get a job at a food place. And there's a Rincewind cameo!It's a funny book, but it's also very sweet."
1,Just get the free EasyLanguage manual from TradeStation,"Much of the text here is already covered in TradeStation's free EasyLanguage reference. The book is sloppily written and edited, and the coding style leaves much to be desired. It is a weird combination of EasyLanguage syntax, trader interviews (get Market Wizards series instead), and a few ""winning"" trading systems, which really are not winners at all. Basically, the text was cobbled together without any underlying insights into how to really build winning trading systems."
1,LACK OF BELIEVEABLE CHARACTERS MAKES THIS A MESS,"I think the author wrote himself into a corner with this, and didn't have the creativity or the energy to work himself out. That an Asian lawman would fall for a western woman is a bit of a stretch, especially if the woman is a grieving widow whose husband has just suffered from a serial killer. Naturally, the woman has to be a tall, gorgeous blond, but I found the situation wholly preposterous and insulting to both races. I don't know why the author had this in the mystery as it really had little to do with the outcome of the novel other than offer the reader some cheap titillation. I wish the author had stuck to the real issues in the thriller and kept it at that..."
1,FAILS TO DELIVER,"I think the plot of this book is very poor. It reads like a first draft. Not really much of a mystery, and the love line doesn't have enough time to develop because of the mystery angle. Why the author chose to bring in elements of theater and stage into the story is understandable considering the author's background, but this really detracts from the stroy. Very little originality and the acting metaphors are too obvious and unenlightening. Descriptions of Shanghai and modern day China may seem ""gritty"" but they are superficial at best. The author needs to research future works better, and I'll think twice before I try him again."
1,WEAK AND UNSATISFYING ENDING,"The idea of murders in a foreign country solved by the local police is not new, although the Chinese slant should have been interesting. I found that the author didn't really develop the characters enough, and the global conspiracy issue was old and trite. Love affair was completely off-base and ridiculous."
1,MEDIOCRE MYSTERY AND NOT MEMORABLE,"Unclear to me what the author was trying to write. The plot and action was very weak, and the characters were unbelieveable. The love angle was a farce and I think the book would have been better if the author had stayed away from that angle entirely. If the aim was to entertain, this book failed to work with me, although it might work better with others."
1,Tedious and uneven,"Why didn't the author just write a book about his novel approach to teaching actors and leave it out of this book? My husband and I both just flipped pages to get past the endless blah blah blah about acting. Had ZIP to do with the story. That riff and the Canadian director all very weak and unformed. We've been to Shanghai so it was interesting on that level. But the rest of it was tedious. Every once in a while the police detective said something that sounded like a glib American. Just not gonna happen. When I finished it, I had a visceral dislike for the whole thing. Why are the reviews negative? How about it's a poorly written, and strangely pretentious book. Based on his bio, a little too autobiographical?"
1,Better to spend your time reading a different mystery,"The book certainly can't provide much of a mystery to the reader because everything is clear after a couple of chapters. The characters are so one dimensional and cardboard, its obvious that the author just borrowed them from somewhere else, added in a couple of details, and tried to convince the reader that they are believeable. The love affair is so juvenile and clumsy, the reader will be bored or embarassed over that section. So, in the end, this book really doesn't provide much entertainment on any level."
3,"Not exactly a factory fit, but it works","This lock works well enough, but hangs loose in the gate unless it's locked, so there's no option to leave it unlocked with the tailgate closed. Other items I viewed that would behave like a normal latch were around $35, I think, so for the price, this suits my needs. Oh, and mine looks a little different from this, too."
3,Limited use,The book is full of examples of using game theory. It shows how to calculate it and how it works. Fine in theory. It maybe be useful in a classroom.The problem in real life is that so such is unknown. In real life both of you do not have all the facts. What is important and what is not. Often you do not know the rules of the game until you are deep inside of it. The logic may be clear later on but not while you are their. You have no idea of the costs or benefits until its to late. Nor do your competitors.
4,"1,2,3 steps in learning sanskrit","This is an excellent book for a dedicated student of yoga, or a training yoga teacher. The guide speaks clearly, and it is easy to follow."
1,Wondra flour went back,No They charged me 11.95 for 1 13 z cotaner.. Inn the store it is $2.45 That is too much money. I SENT IT BACK!It showed 3 cans in the picture. Thet wanted $20 some dollars for 3 cans. That is rediculous!
2,Leonardo Da Vinci for Kids : His Life and Ideas.,"This book was selected as a biography for a 5th grader. Both my child and I felt the book was too cluttered with side bars of historical events and distracting projects. Trying to find information about Da Vinci's life proved elusive. There was no infomation on his childhood, but most glaringly was the lack of information about his skills as a mathematician or astromner. The focus was on his artistic ability, yet there were few pictures of his most famous works. The book did provide infomation, but in a rather boring and cluttered manner. This book is satisfactory as secondary reference. My child, an avid reader, did not enjoy this book. He said it was not for kids."
3,"once I find one error, how can I tell?","While I believe that da Vinci was a vegetarian, his minestrone would not have had tomatoes in it. (Tomatoes are a ""New World"" product that were introduced to Europe by Spanish explorers in the sixteenth century - and many did not eat them as they were known to be in the poisonous nightshade family.) Suddenly my concern is - how can I tell what other errors might be in this book?"
5,stylish watch,"Don't let the pictures in the photo or vestal's website fool you. This watch looks much more slick in person. The band is a nice, dark gun-metal color and the face is more of a metallic biege or pearl color... not the silver on silver as the photo on the website looks."
5,perfect workout for all levels,"this what i was looking for i just bought it ,this is an excellent workout DVD ,THEE IS HIGH MEDIUM LOW LEVELS I LOVE ITyou will find the DVD + A very nice diet recipes book inside.if you do not have time to go to gym this excatly what you need ,fpr home workouts"
2,Only for beginners,"If you're just getting started, then this DVD should provide a good workout and a program you can grow with, going from low- to high-intensity. But for intermediate and advanced exercisers, this DVD won't work. Even after doing all the high-intensity sections, I barely worked up a sweat and certainly didn't feel as if I'd worked out at all."
3,okay dvd .. my 1st workout dvd ..,"When I deciced to get in shape and be healthy, I went out and searched for a Denise Austin DVD. I have heard of her from seeing her workouts on the lifetime channel. I read the reviews and thought this one sounded good. It gives you lots of workouts that work every part of your body. For a while I did this DVD 3 times a week and lost the amount of weight i wanted to , but then i realized i was bored. I love Denise's workouts but she is just too corny. I have to do it with the sound off. she's a ditz. I now stick with CRUNCH DVD'S and THE QUICK FIX SERIES. I do occasionly will go back to densie ,but honestly this is the only dvd of hers that is worth doing. Everything else is just stupid and not challenging enough"
4,Love it!!!,"I really enjoy this workout and it really works!! In the morning I chose the workout that I am going to do because I am in a hurry and need to get ready for work. After the workout I am pumped for the day and the DVD is easy for beginners and advanced to learn. I workout in the evening at a gym but in mornings I use my DVD to work the area that I don't get there at the gym. I feel it's great to begin the day and really works your body, where you need it!"
4,Surprisingly Good,"Stryper, the world's primiere Christian metal band, put out this album as Roxx Regime, their namesake before getting big. Most of the Yellow and Black attack debut mini album is here, even a rock version of the My Love song. There's also an addeed drum solo and an early version of their hit Honestly. The musicianship is excellent, about what I was expecting esp. on From Wrong to Right- Jesus is the way, the devil is a fool. The vocals are intense."
3,diabetic shock,"funny the stuff you remember,i remember this show and the one following it ""the new people"".in a disasterous move, abc created and aired the two as 45min programs, thereby dooming both.another unfortunate move was the choice to highlight the #1 billboard hit of the week...as i recall...that hit was the archies ""sugar, sugar"" for perhaps every week the show aired...hence the variations on the song week after week.we can only be thankful it wasn't ""yummy yummy yummy""."
2,This book made me feel worse!!!,"I didn't find this book comforting at all. It started out to be and then continued in ""what's wrong with me"" ""what did I do wrong that I feel devastated."" It seemed to spin around the fact that a devastated person should just blame themselves for whatever happened!! I know, and of course DO, look at myself in situations but I found very little of the love and comfort of Jesus Christ in this book.I say DON'T READ IT if you're really hurting!! Read God's Word, Pslams or find another book of ""comfort"" because this certainly wasn't it, in my opinion."
5,Smooth Transaction,"Quick to ship, the item was received as described. Love this product; however, it does not smell very good! Will buy from again in the future. Thank you for a smooth transaction."
4,Amazing product,This pHaze product is really amazing- zaps blemishes in one or two days without being too overdrying (especially when combined with a moisturizing toner).Only downside is that the peroxide in the product tends to bleach anything and everything that comes into contact with your treated skin- so beware when using and buy some white face towels!
2,Little Picky Bear,I did not care for the content of this reader. and no decent warning either. My son is already a picky eater and I don't want his reader reinforcing it.The words were fine for its level but the content was not.
1,Too uncomfortable,"I don't know if this works, it was just too uncomfortable for my kid to wear, so was completely useless to us."
5,Making myself whole...,"I received this book as part of a full set of Book House books from my parents in 1938 - the date of my birth. It was stolen from me about 3-4 years ago, along with the rest of the set. The police (bless them) were able to recover most of my original books, but a few were missing. My purchase of this book and a couple of others was simply to have my set complete once again. This particular book really had a bit more wear and tear than described by the seller - but then, my standards were fairly high as my original books were all like new. Just be cautious about buying used books. All of the Book House books from this era are absolutely excellent - with stories and rhymes as originally published. The illustrations are works of art, true to the times. If you're a collector, buy the very highest quality/condition you can find - you will not be disappointed."
2,disappointment to all but the most unknowledgeable fans,"I was excited to get this book, but what a letdown. I have never read any of the other books by this author and his son, and certainly won't now. I found several typos and a slew of downright factual errors in the one hundred or so pages I read before I put it down. I am an avid Red Sox fan, so some of the mistakes won't bother a less interested fan, but they did bother me. And unbelievably, most of the pictures in this book are either reprints of baseball cards, or personal photos taken from the ""Frommer Archives"" (I guess he just hung out at the ballparks for a while. ridiculous). Spend your money on this book if you know little about the Sawks and Yanks and are interested in a broad overview. Otherwise buy ""The Teammates"" or something with a little more spice."
1,Not good for tough soil,"These things are really a pain to put in when placing them in clay. I spent the last 2 hours trying to install these things so they would be straight, but to no avail. They do look nice, but then they install and you look down the line and see an ""S"" wave to it then it sort of defeats the purpose. I'll spend the extra money and install a stone wall."
4,"Interesting, Well researched, great read","O'Neill's ""split"" background led to an interesting life and a fascinating family history. Great read. Would like to get my hands on his other books. Picked up this book in February and missed his book signing in Dublin by hours. Would really like to know how long it took him to intricately research the book.must read for Irish history buffs, Turkish history buffs, or WWII."
1,worst book ever,"This book was horrible. By far the worst I've read. He's a better screenwriter than author. I was expecting to get industry insight and instead I got summaries of all his movies. He tip toes around saying anything negative about the people he's worked with. Afraid of getting sued and of offending, he played it safe here. I would not waste money on this book. Sorry I wasted mine!!!!!!!"
3,"Some good info, but lots of bad language","While Goldman's book is interesting and certainly entertaining, it is riddled with lots of bad language. I enjoyed Goldman's style and his scattered bits of advice, but I could not get over the large amount of gratuitous swear words. Maybe that's not a huge deal for many people, but for the amount of good screenwriting advice, it's not worth the 550-page read. If you want to know about Hollywood and Goldman's opinion of it, maybe this is the right book for you. But if you want screenwriting advice, you should probably go for something else, like Robert McKee's ""Story"" or Blake Snyder's ""Save the Cat."""
3,fsdhal,The add was misleading...i thought i was getting the speakers in the pictures but instead i receieved 2 lower quality ones. Seller refused refund but they work fine.
5,Going to the mat and bring a towel!,Wonderful video. Complete and thorough. Excellent presentation and true to the real Pilates. I did research on instructor Corey and found out she is Master Teacher who learned Pilates from a Master Teacher taught by Joseph Pilates himself! Great credibilty! Nice to know the real thing in an ocean of wanna be's! Video contains important basics and provides for a real challenge for advanced students. Long term resource- great value.
2,West Coast Pilates: The Towel/Matwork Program,"Compared to other video's this one is exceedingly rudimentary.The towel work is a varitation on the wand, just using a towel instead. Nothing new. The mat work is neither integritive, nor classical. Joe would laugh at it............."
1,Momeni New Wave Chinese Hand Tufted Wool Rug,"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. PHOTO SHOWS A BRIGHT VIVID JEWEL-TONED RUG AND IT IS NOTHING OF THE SORT. COLORS ARE MUTED AND DULL. THE BRIGHT YELLOW IN THE PICTURE IS A MUTED GOLD, VERY UGLY COLOR. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. GIVING THE RUG TO MY SISTER FOR HER CRAFT ROOM. HAVE ORDERED A NEW DIFFERENT RUG FROM A COMPANY THAT I KNOW I CAN TRUST WITH TRUE COLOR IN ITS PHOTOS TO THE THOSE ACTUALLY IN THE RUG. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN AN ITEM I HAVE ORDERED FROM AMAZON."
4,Great Book,This a always a great read. Today's life is complicated and these kind of books helps when you enter into difficult situations.
3,"Good concepts, but could be more clear","I thought this book had the right idea, but I'm on the look out for something that is more straightforward. Miss Manners can be very amusing, but I got tired of her referring to herself in the 3rd person. There seems to be a lot of ""filler"" and very little practical advice. Honestly you can skip over most of it and just go for the comments in bold. Everyone should have those phrases at their disposal. I think I will try to read another Ms. Manners book and see if I find it more helpful.And as a recent college grad, I don't think it would be an appropriate gift for anyone to give. Etiquette is something that a person must take into their own hands, or be guided into only by someone very close to them. Giving this as a gift might make the person feel that you are trying to tell them that they have bad etiquette. So I'd suggest if you give it to someone, be sure that you know each other well enough that it won't be misconstrued. Just a thought."
4,E-Books are Great,"Love the stories. Great for people who love to read ghost stories.I haven't read the whole thing yet, so I can give detailed info, but all-in-all this is a great free e-book.Recommended for people who love to read books that make them think."
2,The Hello World of Management books,"If you liked The One Minute Manager or Who Moved My Cheese, this is the book for you.If, on the other hand, you believe that Management is a complex art that cannot be adequately covered with fairy tales, this book will annoy you."
3,"So,This is more fun than your daddies idea of fear !","Starring: David C. Hayes and Scarlet Fry."" SHEER TO THE BONE GORE and KNIFE SLASHINGS GALORE !""Brain Damage has another hit on their hands for fans of extreme retro graphic novels come to life.a Fistful of Innards( A Horror Western,with some sci-fi and surprise-Cant go wrong with H/W !). Rebellion(No Comment), Death Chat(Grrls rule and kick major butt and has cameo by David C Hayes), Meat(Except for pool scenes,Just was just Ill,Good Ill...But ILL !), Closet Case( Homo Horror ???) , The Great Damone(Its basically a remake of Roger Corman's BUCKET OF BLOOD,but a good try,really) and Slash of the Blade( Jack The Ripper with a modern twist and some pretty girls and an awesome costume).SCARLET FRY is the `host with the most' I was a fan of this Icon since Don Dohler's CINEMAGIC Magazine in the '80s.This has all the goods for a blast in front of the plasma with some buds and booze."
5,Implode Grooves + TNI Textures = Epitaph,"Another great album from FLA. The layers upon layers of drums, loops, synths, gothic chorus, vocals are awesome. They all flow together extremely well, and I found it difficult to focus on individual song components because my consicousness kept getting swept away into the mix.Tactical Neural Implant is still my favorite, but the bass grooves on this and Implode make them must have FLA albums."
4,Awesome music for people of any religious faith.,"Jericho Road are a ""boy band"" of 4 LDS(Mormon) guys from different parts of the United States. Their music mostly is of a Christian style(""What His Love Is For"", ""Every Single Tear""), but there are some love songs too(""For the Love of a Woman"", ""Count On Me""). Their music is similiar to the music of most ""boy bands"" like *N Sync and the Backstreet Boys. If you are a fan of ""boy bands"" or Christian music or just want some nice music to relax to, you'll love Jericho Road."
5,Perect Halloween purchase!,"This little Caspar is totally perfect - not too over-the-top spooky and not too cutesy. I bought it for home, but put it up at work the day it arrived. Every single person who walked by my cube stopped to comment on how cute and how nice the Halloween spirit (no pun intended I'm sure). I was sad to tell everyone that it had to go home with me as all the neighbors decorate. I'll look to see if more go on sale, so I can have one for work and one for home. Note: I put it on a timer switch at home so I don't forget to unplug it at night."
4,Good stuff,"I found this book to be good. It's a compilation of short stories, which I love, because you get a variety of the writer's work. I found some of it hard to follow and found myself re-reading pages, but that could have been me, not just the writer. The stories made me think, which is always what I look for. I do reccommend it, but its not high up on my list."
2,pale in comparison to AM Homes short stories,"I got this book from the library and cracked it open, even with its 80's bad art cover it still sounded remotely interesting. I read the whole book - it seemed like it took forever. The stories are too similar and I couldn't remember who was who and what was what. The characters didn't stand out and the stories aren't that interesting. I recently finished reading ""Safety of Objects"" by AM Homes, and this book pales in comparison. Although they are different writing styles this book just simply seems very forgettable. It isn't a waste of time to read because I don't believe any book is, but it definitley does not stand out. Sadly, disappointing."
1,Non Returnable - Does not match with the 501B series,I bought the wrong type. Guillens took it back but I had to pay for extra delivery and return (shipping and handling). Then I bought the right style directly from Guillens.
4,Good rotor with 1 question...,"These are Raybestos upgraded/prem rotor compared to their cheaper model.What that gets you is the center hub is painted black and its supposed to be made of a better metal. The center is painted and that looks nice, not sure if it will hold up. The metal you just have to take at their word at it.Only negative is the newer ones with the painted center are made in China. The older premium rotors from Raybestos were made in the US. I used the older ones in the past and they held up well over many thousands of miles. I am hoping that will also carry over with these Chinese made ones.The rotor did fit and works fine on my 1973 Corvette after drilling out the Hub rivets. I have only had it a short while but so far its fine."
2,Lose the Steel Guitar,"I was really getting in to the first song on this cd...until the twangy steel guitar kicked in and ruined the song. Ryan Adams wants to make rock, but he can't. Leave out the country sounds and you've got some halfway decent music. I doubt we'll hear ANY of these songs on the radio. I don't hear a hit in the bunch. I'm from Tennessee and I can also tell you my state doesn't ****."
3,A collection of demos,"I like the Ryan Adams, but I don't understand why people think this is such a great album. There's some nice songs on it (Chin Up, Cheer Up, Starting to Hurt), but in general, there's no continuity making this an album that sticks together. Ryan's best is still Whiskeytown's Stranger's Almanac, so get that one if you don't yet have it."
2,Disappointed,"really liked 'Gold"" really liked his work with Whiskeytown...but this is kinda discouraging...really looked forward to the new CD...not as good as I expected. Oh well, maybe next time!"
1,"Not ""New"" and not ""Science""","This is a hugely disappointing book !!! I had waited for months for it to come out, being a physicist myself and a fan of Wolfram's previous work, however when I started reading it I couldn't believe how superficial, trivial and Wolfram-centered it was. There's nothing fundamentaly new in this book, cellular automata are not invented by Wolfram, just search on the web for ""The Game of Life"", it was huge in the '70s. There's no 'science' in the book either, just fancy rambling. In all honesty, I think Wolfram went mad ... Very, very sad ..."
2,A 20th century Salieri ?,"Having browsed through the book -no proper thorough reading, I admit- and the various reviews, I find here a similarity with that well known 2nd class author. And I truly enjoyed in the meantime Jozsef Gregor's version of a similarly overdimensioned work: Salieri's Falstaff. Cool !"
2,What egotistical nonsense,Shame on me for ordering a book without reading the reviews first. I sat down last night for about 30 minutes aghast at the egotistical nonsense and rising promises of the early pages. I quickly began to realize that there was little new here and that the hype did not match reality. Kind of like using the author's Wolfram Alpha search engine.
2,Science Neither New nor Kind,"I happily read the first couple hundred pages and found them fascinating. But alas, I found Wolfram's book neither New nor Kind.New? not. The ""discovery"" that simple rules generate complexity is old science.Kind? not. The writing is more patronizing than ""kind.""Science? not. His ""Science"" led me nowhere although I had hoped that I could jump ahead to some insights on genetic evolution but .... no.But then I am an anthropologist, not a physicist, nor a computer ""scientist."""
3,Would some PLEASE write a REAL review?,"If you wish to dispute his claim, write a paper and submit it to the scientific publication of your choice. Some of you people sound like a bunch of Flat-Earthers shaking your fist at Columbus. The ""Eton Narcissist?"" Since when does one resort to name-calling in order to properly review a book?If you want to extol his virtues? ""The Hand of God?"" Please. Did he pay you for that? He should.I read about this book in Discover magazine, and being highly curious and a total layperson, I came here to check it out. Based on the article itself, I do believe I'm going to going to read this book."
3,The Great Programmer,"The key to understanding Mr. Wolfram lies in the work of Juergen Schmidhuber. In his seminal paper from 1996, ""A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything"" the following excerpt applies:""The Great Programmer reappears. Several of the Great Programmer's universes will feature another Great Programmer who programs another Big Computer to run all possible universes. Obviously, there are infinite chains of Great Programmers. If our own universe allowed for enough storage, enough time, and fault-free computing, then you could be one of them.""Having invented Mathematica, Mr. Wolfram now believes himself to be the Great Programmer of our universe."
5,The profound tends to be simple.,"The profound tends to be rooted in simplicity. Having read the previous reviews, it is clear why this 'new kind of science' may take many years to be fully appreciated. There are tremendous ideas at play in Wolfram's thoughts and a casual reader looking for the literary elegance of Richard Feynman or Stephen Hawking will be easily disappointed.An excellent writer Wolfram is not. He flat-out lacks people skills and it shows in his writing. - Though not intentionally, he tends to come across a bit aloof.But all this is easily forgiven once you lock into his message. The content of this book is so RICH and so FRESH that I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE READ!!!"
1,Not a good book,"It took 1000 pages to express a simple idea, that simple non-linear structures can create complex structures. Nice illustrations, but nothing novel. I like economy in writing. The author spreads too much. The book doesn't present anything new. It is better if you just read books on chaos and fractals lineFractals EverywhereorChaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science.This book was another firework in the star system of science"
5,"Great book, really interesting","This book is geared more towards people with moderate scientific knowledge, but in reality anyone can read it. He tries to gently lead the reader into every new subject and teaches it like you would a course in cellular automata. In the beginning, he tells you about his and other people's experience with Cellular Automata and the use of simple programs to produce extreme complexity, starting with weather data and fractals. Then he moves on to different types of automata he and others have come up with, and shows their intricacies. He then tries to apply this information to two and 3 dimensions, observing that they all look very similar. Then he applies them to nature, and is able to derive some phenomenon and even Einstein's gravity equations from some automata. Then he moves on to universal automata, that seem to be able to emulate any other automata. I have about 100 pages to go, so I can't give away the ending."
1,10 years down the drain,"Knowing Wolfram's reputation, this reader was hoping the author was going to leave his huge ego in the closet and try to be convincing and at least somewhat interesting. Wolfram failed on both counts. Not only is the book an absolute bore (but then, mathematics has nothing to do with passion, or does it?), but its repeated promise of an epiphany falls flat on its face. Mr. Wolfram, a genius some say, has spent 10 years writing this book. I can understand he spent 10 years making pretty pictures to complement his arguments, and I can appreciate the metaphor CA represent for computation and complexity, but this book only shows expressions of computation, in nature and elsewhere, and then stands proudly like a fool on the hill... while everybody else went to town."
3,Not original and not correct.,"Wolfram's book is a nightmare to read but here's the idea. Basic physical processes throughout space-time are not the fundamental level of reality but are themselves made up of more basic computational processes. The idea that the universe is at bottom some kind of computer or cellular automata with bits governed by rules isn't new, Ed Fredkin has made this claim before.The problem with this idea is that pure bits (just 0's or 1's), can't be the fundamental level of reality since any bit is just a difference between two basic states, and always has to be implemented by these more basic states. Reality can't be made up of pure differences and that's all bits are. A bit is just ""placeholder"" or ""pure difference structure"" that needs to refer to something such as voltage in a computer."
2,A new kind of doorstop x 256,"I'd recommend that if you see this book in a library or book store, you spend a few minutes looking at some of the pictures. You'd get pretty much the whole idea of the book, except perhaps for one important thing...Wolfram must be one of the most systematic people about -- figuring out a numbering system his cullular automation rules and working through every one, printing them out, classifying them... many of us may have experimented with one or two, but this fellow has looked at all 256 simple ones and millions more.The book is more intersting for its systematic approach than its results. Probably 256 ways to use it to keep your door open, if you spent 10 years thinking about it."
1,Fails to justify its thesis,"Wolfram's ideas just don't pan out. Generation of patterns of one kind or other doesn't establish intelligence in the ``pseudo-random"" generator. I am astonished that Wolfram would have made the claims that he has about cellular automata."
2,"The ""Me too!"" phenomenon.","My theory is that Kauffman's book blew Wolfram's mind. He was playing with cellular automata even before Kauffman and gee it's kind of similar isn't it? And if Kauffman perhaps went a little far in borrowing from Darwin to title his book, which is, admittedly, highly original and important, then why shouldn't Wolfram cast simple automata as equally ground breaking and try to gather to himself the same kind of respect? Doctor, you're no Stu Kauffman."
1,Infomercial,"I am amazed that serious scientists spent many hours writing reviews of this book, here and elsewhere on the Internet.Don't they see that this is an infomercial, designed solely to sell more copies of Mathematica?"
2,Exhaustive study of 2^(2^(3^1))=256 mappings.,"This book gives an exhaustive study of 2^(2^(3^1))=256 mappings that generates one-dimensional cellular automata. Do the discoveries or methodologies in this book generalize to 2 or 3 dimensional cellular automata? Is the author suggesting doing the same kind of exhaustive study of 2^(2^(3^2))=1.3408x10^154 mappings for 2-dimensional or 2^(2^(3^3))=2^134,217,728 mappings for 3-dimensional cellular automata with a regular grid of neighbors? (m^n means m to the n-th power, if you are used to a different notion.)"
1,Wolfram needs to read the latest literature,Cellular automata is not new. The use of CA for modelling is not new. The theories that he disputes are not current. It is similar to arguing that his science is new because it refutes the fact that we are not the center of the universe. The only way any of this would get published in a reviewed journal is if he paid the editor. Which is exactly what he did to get this published.
2,Look at the back inner flap...,"Now, imagine if aliens abducted George Constanza, and for the lark of it, injected him with drugs to give him a billion times his current IQ, and oh...about twice his current ego, modesty and honesty. We would get....Stephen Wolfram! Reading this book, you would think the fairly potty Mr. Worlfram invented the fields of Cellular Automata, Chaos Theory and Complexity. Though many of the experiments described in the book are fascinating to a CA novice like myself, the author's conculsion that he has come up with a new theory of everything suggests early senility and delusions of grandeur. George Constanza would definitely patent or copyright the laws of the universe, if he could. That part, Mr. Wolfram got right...."
1,word of warning...,"Check the publication date of this 1,200 pg. book before you take the above reviews seriously."
1,Gould and Mayr have formulated the real new kind of science,"The author hedges his bet here and takes an orthogenetic and natural selection stance AT THE SAME TIME.I just don't believe him, I'm sure in his case money has a lot to do with it, so that he can sell more copiesof Mathematica, which in the future will contain the secret of life here on earth. What a crock!I thought this reductionist scientific viewpoint went out with the 19th century. It just proves howreactionary the scientific community really is, they're more interested in money and power than the truth.Anyone interested in finding out about the real nature of biological diversity should read "" The Structure of Evolutionary Theory"" by Stephen Jay Gould. Also, ""The Growth of Biological Thought"" by Ernst Mayr. Both of these works give you a much deeper appreciation of how inciteful Darwin really was."
1,An absolute scam,"I was one of those who waited for this book for more than a year, checking its status at least once a month and hardly being able to contain my nerdy excitment ... At what a huge disapointment when it came out !I have a graduate degree in Theoretical Physics, so I am pretty confident I can tell real science from nonsense. Not sure how an otherwise respected scientist, who did produce some good physics in the past came up with such trivia trying to sell it as science.I'm not trying to insult anyone, but the story the comes to mind is that of John Nas before it went mad."
3,Can the Universe be a Cellular Automaton?,"There is much too much here to have digested so soon after publication. But Wolfram's central theme, that the Universe is really a giant Cellular Automaton, runs smack into the Bell Inequality. Any local realistic theory must obey the Bell Inequality, and CA's are as local and realistic as it gets; but the world itself, according to both Quantum Mechanical theory and experimental test, does not always satisfy the Bell Inequality.If Wolfram has found a way around the Bell Inequality, he deserves a Nobel Prize. If he hasn't, his book is fatally disconnected from reality."
4,Japanese cuisine revealed,"Not only do you learn about the various ingredients which are indigenous to the country, and essential to their cuisine but it is a trip thoughout the country, through pictures and text to the wonderful sights and aromas of this mysterious land. Familiar foods are prepared in totally different ways, and new ones are there to explore. With the advent of many ethnic food shops and open markets catering to many different cuisines one is now able to put a Japanese dish on your own table. Good reading without cooking as well."
3,Yes... but how did they train?,"Brilliantly written (factual errors notwithstanding), excellent on Bowerman, full of detail about the Men of Oregon... but if you are a runner looking to find out how Bowerman trained his athletes and what they actually did, you'll be disappointed, like me.Yes, I got his general philosphy, got the idea that he trained everybody differently, understand that he erred on the side of caution and yes, OK, it is oh so funny (not) that he urinated on people in the showers and pressed hot keys into their legs... but what I really wanted to know is how, specifically, did he train these people?The answers are not in this book."
5,Bowerman is alive and well,"This book was recommended to me, and I am glad I took the recommendation. Kenny Moore, who wrote the screenplay for Without Limits, one of the two Prefontaine movies, does it again. One cautionary note: once you pick this book up be prepared to read for long periods of time without wanting to put it down."
2,Look elsewhere,I've had this case for about six month so far and it's already starting to fall apart. I don't have any problems with my signal strength with this case like the other reviewer though. The problems I've experianced with this case are as follows:1. You can't use the keypad with the case door closed.2. It is difficult to hear whoever you are talking to if the case is closed.3. The pin holding the door hinge together has started falling out.4. The belt clip falls apart very easily. If you don't find the parts to put it back together then you are out the belt clip.The case does however protect the phone but it isn't worth purchasing it.
1,Definitely DeMille's worst,"I have read and enjoyed most of DeMille's other books, so I was surprised at how poor this was. I honestly thought it must be some sort of parody; the characters are lazy caricatures and the plot is nonsensical and uninteresting. Overall a terrible reading experience. Go read one of his other books instead!"
3,"Not DeMille's best, but still a good read","I had very high hopes for this book after reading The Charm School, and unfortunately this one didn't quite measure up. However, if you enjoy the spy-thriller genre, this book is a good investment of your time and money. You won't walk away saying it's the best you've ever read, but it will hold your attention and provide some good excitement along the way."
3,It's okay,Not one of my favorite DeMille books. Took me a long time to finish this one. Not one I would read again.
5,Sports Night - The Complete Series,"The names Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme (and the excellent teams with which they surround themselves) linked to any kind of production means a quality show. Sports Night - as far as I am aware - never made it across the herring pond to the UK. So when it came out on DVD, I couldn't wait to buy the boxed set.It's brilliantly cast. The dialogue sparkles. The storylines entertain, inform, delight and never fail to broaden our understanding of the human condition."
5,"or, you don't know what you had til it's gone...","When I first saw Sports Night offered on DVD, I was reminded of the frustration of trying to find the day and timeslot in which this show was going to be on in any particular week (due to the scheduling madness of ABC management). It was worth the chase. Now it's on my shelf, screw the network, and I watch it often and whenever I want.It is one of the 10 best series television has offered yet. and we're out....."
5,Welcome back,"Well, I'm not the only one who missed this show dreadfully and is tickled to have the chance to view it again. And network executives wonder why so many new comedies fail. This show didn't have guffaws, it had witty dialogue, characters you cared about, and it made you think."
1,Waste of Money,"You are nuts if you spend $20 for nine measly MP maps. Console gamers are getting ripped off if they put up with this. On the PC this map pack would have been a free download, along with countless other fan-made mods. That's all I got to say on this matter."
4,Halo 2 multi player,Fun Game. The only down fall is that you must have another player at all times. But I enjoy the game.
3,discolored,I was a little surprised when the ball arrived. The white part was all discolored with a yellow tint. But my daughter liked it and didn't want me to return it.
2,great story - terrible edition,"I read this book many years ago, and enjoyed the story once again. It spans several generations of a family of English loyalists who settled in the island of Exuma in the Bahamas after the American Revolution.The problem: this is by far the most poorly edited book I have ever read. There are typographical errors on almost every page, some of which are serious enough to distort meaning, unless you read carefully. I notified the publisher, and Penguin, with whom the present publisher has an agreement, because I think that the book and its author deserve much better.With that caveat, it is a very good story. If you can find a different edition, so much the better."
3,Good. Good!,i really liked it.The differences in my body are visible and i confess i haven't gone that much to the gym at this past month.
1,Received damaged and incorrrect product,"When we received this tank, it was craked down the side. But the other thing we noticed is that what we received was not what was advertised on Amazon. I called Paintball-Online's customer service and they told me that apparently the tank was sent ""pressurized"" which made it crack. They sent me a pre-paid label to send it back. At that time, I requested to speak to a manager so that I could make sure that when they sent me out the replacement, it was the correct item. I was informed that he would call me back. Well, no call. I left 4 subsequent messages over the next few days, and still no call back. Well, what ended up happening is instead of sending a replacement, they refunded us the money (through Amazon). So, in the end that was ok with me because at that point I was very unsure of what I would receive."
3,You get what you pay for,"In the heat of the dayWith the breeze of a fanWhen your child wants to drawAnd you say that he canAnd he wants to draw facesYes, faces so funnySo you take out this book(Which costs so little money)And he opens the bookAnd he flips through the pagesWith cartoony sketchesIn various stagesThen his little brow furrowsWith pencil in handAs he tries to find facesNot ugly or bland""Mummy,"" says he,""These are all rather cheesySome are quite hardAnd some are too easyThe clown is too sadAnd the vampire sucksI think that I'd ratherGo draw me someTrucks""I looked at the bookAnd I saw what he meantAlthough younger childrenMight well be contentI'd hoped it would showFaces happy and sadOr laughing or yellingOr angry or madIt lacks inspirationThe drawings aren't niceYou get what you pay forAt such a low priceAmanda Richards, July 10, 2008"
3,A serviceable book,"Harris perpetuates a ""great legend"". But the comments by Jean Garceau, Lombard's secretary, are telling."
1,Wonderful while it lasted,"But, like many others have already written, you're lucky if you can get more than two years out of it.Mine just died. No particular reason, it just quit. Kaput. No power, no lights, no nothing. This is the SECOND Panasonic VCR that has quit on me like this in the past three years. Neither lasted 24 months.I'll never buy Panasonic again, and I've bought several over the years and been very pleased with them. I don't know what happened to them, I guess Indonesian assembly plants did them in. I hope they saved a ton of money, because they won't get another dime of mine."
1,DVD side is junk,"I set it up in my RV. The VHS works great, Easy to program, Poped in a DVD and it cant read them, tried several including CD's must be defective so I would rate the DVD side JUNK!"
1,"I was ""led astray"" when I thought I was about to read a good book","This was perhaps the worst book I have ever read in my entire life.Whenever I see such an author published, it gives me hope that maybe it's not as difficult as I thought to break into the elite world of ""The Published.""I lost count of all the times I rolled my eyes and breathed an ""Oh, please"" while reading this. The plot was VERY weak, Jenny was VERY pathetic, and Cage was VERY cliche.I agree 100% with the commenters that mention Cage raping Jenny. That's how their whole love affair starts. Is that not terrible?! Not to mentioned that they were raised practically as siblings. *shudders*"
3,Un-even,"I've had the pen for about 3 months now, the brush side works nicely and is very useful. The other side was useful for about a month but didn't last more then that as it gradually got dirty and then just fell off. Not worth the money in my opinion."
3,Just OK,"I liked the idea of the lens pen cleaning system, and was so excited about getting one. But what I can say, I think microfiber clothes work better than the pen. The pen doesn't remove any stains, but just smudges them around. The brush is OK though.The good thing about the pen is it's small enough to be put in any bag even in my jacket packet. It's conveniently reached."
4,Works fine,"It works like it should, no problem with the item. Becareful with the sponge end though, good product overall, and well build."
1,Horrible!! Doesn't clean at all!,This is a horrible product. The cleaning brush isn't good at all and is very coarse. The cleaning tip is even worse. It doesn't clean properly and leaves dust behind. The cleaning tip does not replenish when twisting the cap. This is a very bad product. Save your money and get a regular camera cleaning lens and spray!!
3,a brush and ?,"I don't get it? What is it? A brush and some type of felt pad? It does not ""remove"" it blends. Best way to clean is to use a Gotti blower, lens tissue and lens solution. A brush is good to use as well. I blow off my camera every time I use it. Not worth it really. A brush would be just fine."
1,Brush only,"The tip for cleaning lens will not last long while the brush is convenient for removing dust and other fine particles. Also good for mirror system. Just don't count on the tip holding up, purchase a micro cloth and air blower. (I purchased a nasal aspirator and works well. Also much cheaper than a camera bulb)."
2,Is this normal????,"I've had my pen for just a few days, and when I gently touched the pad end it left a dark black residue on my finger. Probably a dumb question, but IS THIS NORMAL???? I'm a little worried this black material will transfer to my lens. Has anyone had this happen? On a positive note, it seems like it would be good at cleaning a spot from the extreme perimeter of your lens, where it meets the metal housing. I would appreciate any comments."
3,i went with this thinking it would be better than cheaper ones...i was wrong,the tip is starting to come off (unglued) from the piece that holds it....this could be because i have to press so hard on it to actually get anything but its edges to clean...the tip is very stiff and instead of hugging the lens only the enges of the circle touch the glass unless you press down.i noticed hairs from the brush fall off 4 times already inside my lenses which i opened for cleaning...frustrating to say the least.the pen cleans well but ive only used it maybe 6 times and im already worried about the tip falling off...dont feel like i got my moneys worth.seeing as though it was my first lens pen...i would advise anyone and everyone to just get the cheaper ones...if the expensive one doesnt last might aswell save some money and get your handfull of cleannings out of a 4$ pen instead of a 15$ one.
4,lens cleaner,It's an O.K. cleaner. It's actuallt easier to use a wipt but the shape of the cleaner allows it to be carried like a pen.
5,Excellent product,"This little pen is great, I am using it constantly to clean the dust or smudges off my lenses and filters. Some filters I bought had some sort of adhesive stuck on them and with a little fog from my breath and a few swipes of the applicator they were good as new. the applicator is some sort of charcoal or other material that is made for lenses so don't get it on your hands or anything, It also has a self cleaning feature inside the cap, just give it a little twist."
5,This is a great book,"I am a total die hard LaVyrle Spencer fan This is a great read or listen either way you get it,I've read it a couple times and listened to it too."
3,Needed an epiloge....,"I was very disapointed that there was no final epiloge to tie up some of the loose ends......(Spoilers!)...Does Rachel get pregnant? She is certainly not too old and I would love to know if she and Tommy Lee were ever able to share this experience..Did they ever try to find the other ""Beth""? What a great ending to have them be able to at least meet her and explain why she had been givenup for adoption.Did Tommy Lee ever quit smoking? My God, he to to have tasted like an ashtray, and she had already lost one husband to cancer. She needed to insist he give up the the cigarettes NOW!Did any of the parents ever apologize to their children for what they had done?Would have given this one 4 stars if these issued had been addressed.(Plus they lived in Alabama but didn't have a southern accent!?!)"
5,Restaurant Biz is Showbiz!,"A must book for your business. Filled with ideas and examples. Absolutely inspiring. I not only believe in this book but I have bought it for friends in the business -- but only the ones with restaurants in other cities! A no brainer, buy it now."
4,i'm a sailor so this tv is god,since i'm under way for ever it's worth haing this tv light compact graffic are great for personal dvd watching or team player in halo or ps3 zoning i'm very happy with this purchase
2,I'd rather listen to the original,"If I never knew Bryan Ferry's version of this song from his Roxy Music days, I'd say her rendition was excellent. But I do know the original and I wished the radio stations would play his song and not this fluff. If you think this is a 5 star song, I suggest that you take a listen to Roxy Music's (Bryan Ferry) album titled ""Avalon."" You'll realize that Emmie is substandard and that Ferry deserves 10 stars!"
5,sling swivels,I needed these for my Mossy 500 tactical modification. One was used on the exiting stud at the rear bottom of the butt. The other I custom installed near the front of the adjustable stock for single point carry.
4,Deep Purple brings down a storm,"A score for getting the two for the price of one. I remember Burn way back when Coverdale was in the band and sang live and stormbringer with Hughes just proves why the two had to form their own projects, two totally different stage personalities.I elevate David higher than all the other vocalists and enjoy his stage persona...however In these two discs the highlight is the packaging and compilation, however if you are a DP fan then the re-issue of Strombringer will be worth the extra cash as it has bonus songs and finer packaging."
3,Decent...,"After hearing all the hype, and with the movie coming out, I decided to pick up this novel, and see what all the fuss was about. Parts of the novel were exciting, tense, and well written, but others seemed to drag - a 150 page period of discovery could've (well - should've) been reduced to 50 or 75. All in all, a decent read, but not a classic by any means."
5,More to all this?,"There is a man who wrote a book manuscript later rewritten as a movie script with actual names concealed about one year prior to this book about a handicapped,neglected and abused orphan living in Woburn in the same neighborhoods of the earliest childhood victims. The work was written with no knowledge of Harr or of this case. the movie script was forwarded to Hollywood. At the time the man had a ""friend"" living next town over and as far as the man knew neither the man forwarding the script knew the ""friend"" or vice-versa.After Harr's book came out, the man came under heavy attack and the man was confused as to why. One day he talked with ""friend"" about his concerns,Harr's book and his own script and ""friend"" blurted out ""Well, i'm not going to jail......"" and changed the subject never offering an explanation.Has a child who survived this been monitored all his life by individuals who feel threatened by the Woburn case?"
2,Interesting but very dry,"I was really into this book in the first few chapters. It had the potential to be a real page turner. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. I thought the story developed very slowly and the writing was extremely dry. A real disappointment - my expections were much higher."
2,Good start but then looses it,"I did not like this book. Environmental waste, a hot issue, good subject, but the writer could not hold my attention. I lost my attention after a good start, but never finished the last approxemately forty pages of the book. I just didn't care anymore. Good grief, please bring it to an end already!?!?!?!"
5,excellent read. eye opening view of corporate polluters!,"ride the emotional rollercoaster of toxic polluter litigation. read about the very personal and often depressing ordeal suffered by families who have experienced first hand the devastating effect industrial pollution has on children and society. you can also sense a little ""david v. goliath"", as a flamboyant attorney takes on corporate america. finally learn about the difficult and time consuming effort it takes to wage a battle against deep pocketed corporations."
2,Abridged too far,"From the other reader comments, which are uniformly enthusiastic, I must conclude that the uninspiring mess I listened to was the result of overly zealous abridgement by the audio script editors. Mispronunciation of medical terms by the reader didn't help any. I can't recommend purchasing this cassette, but by all means, don't be dissuaded from reading the book."
1,You might as well just read about it in the paper.,"I couldn't get into this book. It was nothing but the facts, and had no entertainment value at all. But, since I am used to Grisham, I guess reading non-fiction law isn't the same. I didn't finish it cuz I felt like there might be a test at the end and I'd fail it! You could probably get the jist of this in the local newspaper or the evening news. I heard pretty much the same review for the movie, too."
5,"Make sure you find time to rest at work, what a read",This was one of the most interesting non-fiction stories I have ever read. I developed so many relationships with the subjects it was difficult not to challenge the judicial system at every injustice. It was fascinating to observe the various lawyers and there tactics. I gave a copy to a friend as a gift and got a call shortly after that he had received the same book from a friend. I would say that is good testimony.
5,Riveting Legal Drama-Excellent Depiction of Court System,"A Civil ACtion is the best book I have read on Legal System, I have been a paralegal for 12 years and worked on the EPA Superfund cases. The firm I worked for also went bankrupt. The case is writtten beautifully and the steps for presenting a case of this magnitude is vast . If you believe in justice and our legal system read this book it will enlighten you."
4,a decent read,"I had hoped that there would be more details on the epidemiological fieldwork that was associated with this investigation, but there was not too much of interest in that respect. Nevertheless I enjoyed the read, and it really made me think about our legal system and corporate responsibility. The author does a good job of bringing the characters to life, and I could empathize with many of them. Overall I found the story to be pretty disallusioning and sometimes depressing, but well worth the time I spent reading it."
1,DONT DO IT!!!,"FYI, when I purchased a book from this seller 1, I never received the book, and 2, when I tried to contact them about it, I never got a response."
3,Is there much more to the story than this?,"Was the severity of this case downplayed? Why were the court records (about 190,000 pages) of this case thrown away after the book was written? Why are some of the obituaries and other info relevant to the history of Woburn excluded from the microfilm of local newspapers? Were some kids involved in the Woburn epidemic enrolled in secret medical experiments and then tracked or automatically inducted into government service later as a result of such treatments? Was the handling of the water pollution and long term exposure of thousands of people in Woburn and surrounding communities an experiment? Did one of the kids in the case not die? Many unanswered questions!"
4,Pretty darn good program--and fun!,"I'm a long-distance bicyclist and this program is a lot of help--and a lot of fun!--in mapping out rides I have done, do regularly, or want to do. The maps come up quickly and the detail is fantastic, very accurate; click the proper button and street/road names come up to help you orient yourself. Clicks easily between detail levels of mapping. The elevation profiles are really helpful for a cyclist or hiker. There's a learning curve that could be easier, but all in all, it by far beats the online mapping programs I have used. Makes me wish I had a GPS so I could use all those features, as well. Highly recommended for people who have time and inclination to learn the program."
2,VERY DISAPOINTING,"I purchased 3 of these. A mistake. Shoes just slide right off. Looked good in theory, Unless your shoe has a distinct separate heel, they WILL slide off. Would NOT buy again."
2,Shoes slip off....,"I'm asking myself why I put up with this shoe rack for over 3 years now. We're using it for our daughter's shoes. We've been frustrated with it since day 1. The racks slope too much; few of her shoes will stay on it. If you use this rack only for shoes that have a heel, even a slight heel, you'll be happier with it."
1,Broken Upon Receipt,This product is not well made. The welding had come off in two places when I received it.
3,Over priced,"Theses are OK knives. Not worth the price however. Make sure to wash and dry by hand or they will rust fast. Washed the chefs knife, and didn't dry it all the way and already had rust."
4,OXO Good Grips Professional 14-Piece Knife Block Set,"Very good set of knives but steak knives are realy cheaply made, they are sharp but there is a considerable lack of quality in comparison with the rest of the knives. Just look at this set as there were no steak knives at all. I wanted to make this clear as I see nobody else mentioned it."
5,great!,"I bought them for a friend and he said it is the sharpest knife set he has ever owned. Already cut himself a few times...not that you would want to! I love this brand, and when i need a new set will surely buy one from this company."
1,Terrible,"I have used these strings on my guitar for years and always very happy with them, but these were terrible. Strings were ""dead"" the second I put them on. Maybe old... who knows. Went to guitar center, bought the exact same strings and they were fine."
3,a little bit about bits,"general info. is good, but being ignorant about bits i was hoping for more in depth information."
4,Great product; lousy support (from 3 different companies!),"The phone works fine (but only with the earbud -- without it, the volume is inaudible); the PDA is great; the two together simplify, and improve life. Between them, however, Handspring and Sprint (and now Palm) make it hard to get simple questions answered, and impossible to answer hard questions. Why can one only get a replacement earbud from Handspring, and not Sprint? Why wouldn't two different Sprint store managers know that? Why would they keep giving out Sprint earbuds -- for free! -- that don't work? Why would they need to keep the Treo 300 for two days to figure that out? Don't get me started on the week it takes to get a replacement earbud via Fedex! Not to mention the unavailability of replacement styluses! Exclamation points! Still and all, good is better than perfect, and I look forward to upgrading to a Treo 600 when they get the backlog problem sorted out and the cost comes down."
5,"Good phone, great price.","I paid $100 for the phone with Sprint/Handspring discounts. Works fine with a Mac Powerbook. Wireless modem connects my laptop to the internet anywhere I get phone service. I can receive and send emails through snappermail. Palm Desktop works great. The phone does not get the best signal, and the speaker phone is not loud enough, but if you are looking for a cheap phone that has email, wireless modem, internet browsing, text-messaging, and Palm OS for less than $400, this is a good way to go. Setup could be impossible for computer illiterates. Sprint is not helpful, but it is possible and the software will eventually all work."
1,Worst purchase I ever made,Horrible product - never worked properly - ended up buying different phone - horrible customer service from seller
1,Handspring Treo 300,"Had 2 of these Treos, both defective in one function or another. Try wrestling with Handspring for help.Sprint PCS vision is so slow it's completely worthless."
5,Exactly what I've been looking for in a Black hair color!,"I have been using box color for years and my previous color (by another brand) was discontinued. This color has a purple wash when you rinse out your hair compared to most of the black colors that have a blue wash... This black hair color is so beautiful, rich and shiny! It covers my grey really well. If I had to make one suggestion, I wish it were a bit thicker... Otherwise, I Love it and couldn't be happier with the Ultimate Black! :)"
5,Hamilton Beach 932 Commercial juicer,"I am so pleased with our new juicer. It has been used multiple times a day over the past month we have owned it. It is easy to clean the three removable parts that come into contact with the orange and juice and all the other parts are easy to wipe down too.My eight year old is able to use this and has lots of fun making juice for everyone who wants a glass. We are finally putting a dent in our orange supply as our tree is pretty loaded this year. We did have an electric juicer which we received as a wedding present 19 years ago and we did use it occasionally, maybe twice a year, but having this unit on the counter and having it so easy to use and clean makes it a great addition to our kitchen. Oh, one thing I do notice is the handle and top of the juicer that comes down on the orange will unscrew occasionally. I think it is partly due to the juicing action so the pieces need to be tightened occasionally."
1,Not for commercial use!!!!!,"Bought this jucier for a farmers market. Used it at 2 markets and sold around 300 glasses of lemonade and this thing is falling apart. Every screw is loose and I hope I can use loc-tite to fix it. I would not buy this product again, I think I will have to buy another juicer and it will not be a hamilton beach. Do not buy if you plan to really use. Junk!"
4,Mighty Manual Juicer,"After a month's use I'm pleased with the juicer. Grapefruit & lemons homegrown were well juiced..... The cup on the swing arm could be larger and translucent for spotting near overflow, I remedied that by swinging the metal arm over & placing a wide mouth glass below."
4,"Pretty good, Excellent Power Ouput","These speakers are well worth your money, especially with the price that they are selling it for. The speakers and subwoofer maybe be small compared to other speaker systems but this is good in the fact that you can put it almost anywhere. Although, it is small it has a lot of power. Just half volume and it's already intense. It's excellent for Gaming, and Music. Especially with CounterStrike, and other multiplayer games. Gun shots, grenades, and all other effects are very crisp and intense. As for music goes it is one of the best I have experienced in Cambridge porducts (knowing that I have good knowledge in what speakers supposed to sound like). The Subwoofer surprised me because I didn't expect all that much power to come out, out of that small sub. Overall, I really enjoy the FPS 1600 and it is a very good investment that is well worth your money. I mean you can spend $...+ on other speakers that give you the same quality and power but for a higher price."
1,"I don't care if ""She Wants To Move.""","I'm not stopping her. I ain't her mama. I can not tell her what to do. I hate this song. It should be more like, ""She Wants To Poop."""
5,Leading us thru the project,This book is a must for all persons in the engineering management field whether a novice or old timer. It is easily understood by all levels and deciplines of engineering and should be required reading for management. The verbal pictures drawn are as clear as if a master draftman himself put pencil to paper and created a drawing. If only such a book were available when I was coming up thru the ranks from draftsman to engineer!
2,Beginner's book,"This book is probably interesting and useful for beginner clay projects, but with one exception, it is virtually useless to advanced clayers. I was disappointed in the book."
3,MTV Presents...,"This is a decent collection of Hip-Hop Tunes. My one negative on this disc was that the ""The Show"" wasn't the full-length (12-inch) release.Three stars..."
5,Exciting story of brother & sister!,"Will has an accident and loses his leg, but WINTERING WELL is not gross or sad ... it is about how he copes, and how his sister Cassie helps him ... and they both learn that challenges can bring exciting rewards. I couldn't put it down, and I'm older than 13. Really good and exciting and feels real..One of my favorite books now!"
3,Not so much,"This book is always on recommended lists when I search for something new, so I thought that I would give it a try - everything started with a rush and excitement and (there are NO spoilers ahead, so I will keep things vague) and it started to taper - things happened through out the story that kept me interested because of my curiosity, but in the end this does not land on the mark for me - I could not care about the characters because there was nothing to care about, and if there was something to attach to, it was taken away (several different moments of this) and I was left like I had just read a 500+ page novel and I am still hungry for something - but not this."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Mercenary bunch battle bad guys, even if there is no money in it.The Raven are a famous mercenary band, whose training and tactics and wililngness to bail out on a bad situation or broken contract have kept them alive. Along Barclay's writing is rather limited that isn't really the point here, as we have a quest fantasy that is a little closer to the heroic fantasy end than the high, despite an elf and the odd dragon. World shattering spells and events are to be stopped, and the famous band even has a few fatalities."
3,"Excellent research, but...","As a fan of Victorian literature, I looked forward to reading Anne Perry. While I got a well researched mystery, the plotline of this particular mystery offers very little to keep the reader going. Entertaining, but somewhat bland."
2,The Whitechapel Conspiracy,"I have enjoyed earlier books by Anne Perry but found this one static and colorless. The action was extremely limited, being confined mostly to Gracie and Tellman following people around London and eavesdropping on their exchanges. The constant harangues about loyalty and political freedom that issued from nearly every character's mouth were tiresome and sanctimonious. And the author's writing has gotten sloppy -- lots of repeated phrases, cliches, and even a couple of remarks that could never have been uttered by people living in the 19th century (someone is said to ""do a Marie Antoinette,"" and a person with an unwholesome interest in a third party is described as having ""a thing"" for him/her). A very disappointing effort, in short."
3,Not Close Enough,"In comparing this repro with an original in my collection, I find some significant differences. The stitching is lighter, particular on the ""frosch"", and the buckle is considerably different. The edges are rounded more than the original and both of the pins are shaped differently. The one holding the buckle to the sling should be ground flat on the ends, not rounded, and the ""roller"" should have larger and rounder ends. Overall it is acceptable for reenactment or display use, but could be better with these changes."
5,Very soothing for alzheimers patient,"MY MOTHER HAS ALZHEIMERS AND SOME THINGS GET FOR HER TO WATCH CONFUSE HER. DANIEL HAS SUCH A SOOTHING VOICE THAT SHE WAS CAPTIVATED BY IT. wE HAVE SEEN HIM ON PUBLIC TELEVISION, BUT FIRST DVD ORDERED. WILL ORDER AGAIN."
5,O'Donnell - ongs of Faith,This item has come and I purchased it for my mother-in-law. She likes it vrey much.
4,great songs,"Great to get his songs on Cd... only had vinyl before and the records were wearing out!! Bit disappointed with the ""different"" songs on the CD that I did not know. dream machine for example. But just great to get the other great songs on CD and hear Duffy's voice clearer :)"
1,Disappointed,"For a person with such a nice voice I thought this CD was bland and very poorly done. It sounded like a very young, untrained, boy at his first recital. Certainly could have used some more background music. I made a ""Bad buy"""
1,Way too expensive for its features- Get Archos Gmini 400,"Having owned the ipod for 8 months now, I decided to try another product. Anyone who buys an ipod only want it for the beauty and not its purpose. ""dont judge a book by its cover."" Sure the ipod looks very beautiful on the outside but look, you're paying premium price for just the looks and not the features. However, the Archos Gmini 400 is more than 50 dollars less than this ipod and look! its the same size and weight as the 20 gig ipod with video playback, photo, voice recording features. People who buy ipods are just trying to ""get with the crowd"" and do not realize the pettiness of its features. Get the Archos Gmini 400."
1,What a Lemon!!!!,"I got it new about 2 years ago. I bought it from Apple's Refurb site, and when it arrived, it showed the sad iPod icon. I took it to Apple, they said it needed a new hard drive!!!! Then the clickwheel went on it, which makes it so it won't always respond. Then the hold switch won't lock on it, and then all the problems stopped for a while. Then 5 months later, it wouldn't even turn on, and then only the backlight would show, and there was nothing on the screen. When the warranty was up, it died on that day. Now it sits in it's box on my desk. Don't buy this iPod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Warning,"MY IPOD worked perfectly for exactly one year and five days. However, just as the 1 year warranty expired, my IPOD's hard drive crashed not only deleting the four thousand songs that I had worked so hard to build up (and spent plenty of money downloading). It seems quite convenient that almost the day after the warranty expired, the IPOD crashed. If you are going to buy an IPOD, go for the cheapest one as it is absolutely crushing to have this happen to a $350 dollar piece of equipment."
2,Thinking about buying an IPOD for use on a Windows machine?,"First, check the user forums on the MAC website. Look at the comments from users of ITunes who've tried to use recent upgrades.Second, try to find customer support.(...and I haven't even mentioned the terrible battery. I have a 40 gig, and I rarely can get more than 4 hours of play-time from a charge.)"
3,death on clockwork,"believe the 'one year rule', I've had my iPod since last march ('05) and it worked great until last week. All of a sudden I noticed the battery wasn't holding a charge, then my computer and itunes wouldn't recognize it, and after resetting it (ie erasing all my music from it) and reinstalling itunes I can't get it to work. I'm hoping when I go to the Apple store that they can figure something out, I don't feel like getting it 'serviced' for $250."
2,love to hate in one drop.,"Purchased my Ipod 3 days ago and absolutely loved it. Decided it was the coolest thing I had ever owned. And then I dropped it. I had it in my back pocket and went to sit down. Fell out of my back pocket onto a tile floor and shattered the display. Keep in mind it fell less than 2 feet. For a portable device that is meant to take everywhere, you have to anticipate an accident like this. Extremely disappointed in the durability of this product. Thought about packaging it up and returning it saying it arrived like this, but the chrome back is so scratched after 3 days of use, they would never buy it. Not sure what I am going to do, but feel sick about losing 400 bucks in a 2 foot fall. The unit still works, but I can't read the display well enough to move through the functions."
4,Good guide,"I was one month in San Francisco and i used this guide a lot. Its pictures, maps and useful information helped me to have a nice vacation. I recommend this guide as a basic tool."
1,"Pretty pictures, lackluster information","This is a guide with beautiful pictures but is horribly lacking in practical information to help someone get around San Francisco. The maps are rudimentary -- not something one would want in the confusing SF bay area. The guidebook gives great ideas on places to go but won't help you really get there -- sections on using public transport (essential in a city where there are 300,000 cars registered but only 200,000 parking spaces). The accomodation information is sorely lacking; there are few options for those who don't want to pay over $80.00 a night to be in SF. The sections on public safety are also lacking in complexity. This book is a must for those who don't enjoy their vacations and like to be stuck in traffic."
1,don't ordet it,"hi,the rating for this item should be 0 ,i paid for this product and i recieved an e-mail from the company of how to download the product ,i followd the instruction and end up having kids story bood,i contacted the company so many times ,they want me to give them my credit card no. again and after that i didn't get any reply ,i contacted amazon ,they said they will investigate,,,i don't think this company even exist,i lost my money ,so don't even think about dealing with them ,i don't want you to lose your money too."
3,"Not Grape, Groundball Grape!","Original Grape and ground ball grape are two entirely different flavors. I ordered grape specifically from this company, but they sent me crappy ground ball grape instead."
4,GOOD FUN HORROR FLICKS TO WATCH AND JUST IN TIME FOR HALLOWEEN!!!!!!,"Wishmaster and Wishmaster 2 Evil Never Dies are just plan fun to watch and if you are having a slumber party or just in the mood for some fun horror flicks i would check these two out!!!!!!! A evil genie grants people's wishes,but takes their souls!!!!! I'm not a huge fan of this boogeymen,but like i say before its just good plain fun to watch them every now and then and just in time for the halloween season!!!!!"
5,thriller,"I find the quality of the DVD is very professional, and I would reccommend it for anyone that likes sci-fi"
1,broke,This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for my niece and it did not work when she opened it. Very disappointed 6 year old. Now i have to try and find another one at a real store instead of online and i do not like shopping in crowds.
1,Cd,Neither one would work put two sets of new batteries in each and they wouldn't turn on.So I retured them
1,AWFUL NEXT PLAY,"My Next Play Portable CD player came and I was excited for my English Language Learners to use it in my listening center. How sad that the player does not work!!! Even worse is the fact that since I opened the CD player, it is not returnable!! I have NEVER been so disappointed in a purchase. Worse yet was the the look on my 12 students' faces when they weren't able to use it!!!"
1,BAD ITEM,"I bought 2 of these for my daughters for Christmas. They were very disapointed when we put in the batteries and the dumb things would not even turn on. I returned both to seller and only received a partial refund. Amazon states that if item is damaged or defective return shipping is not charged. I was informed that the items were not damaged or defective, therefore I would have to eat the cost of shipping. The seller was also not very helpful when I reported that items were junk."
3,He didn't make a strong argument for each point,"This book contains a lot of useful information, yet the only problem lies on his way to express and prove it. Normally, I saw he made a point, then gave an example for that point which also help him jump to another point... After all, it's really hard to absorb something out of this book. It will be better if the author pays more attention to explain his point, makes his argument stronger."
2,Gonna give it another try,"I really cannot say that these have improved my vision, nor reduced or slowed the movement of my floaters, which is my reason for trying Ocuvite. I have taken them for 3 months without any noticeable difference. I will give them another try though since it appears that so many have highly recommended/reviewed this product. Perhaps it takes longer than 3 months to effectuate any change. I suspect that this is one of those situations where every single experience will differ from the next and the best thing to do it just try them for yourself.UPDATE: After another round of taking this supplement, I am reporting that I see no change in my vision nor have my floaters deceased. In fact, I seem to notice more of a film on the surface of my eye than I did pre-Occuvite. So, for me, they are not the answer. I recently learned about Doctors Best Best Serrapeptase helping with eye floaters, so that will be my next purchase and trial."
2,No Noticeable Difference,My eye doctor told me my eyes were very dry and recommended I use artificial tears several times daily. I was hoping this product would improve the dryness in my eyes so I wouldn't have to use the eye drops. I've been using it for a month now and can see no difference. Maybe I haven't given it long enough but I don't plan on continuing.
2,Not what it looks like!,"The ball in the picture shows the 2 white panels on the ball, making it look like it has multi-color panels all the way around the ball; just like a 3-point basketball but it does'nt! The ball only has literally 2 panels as the title states, not 2 color panels. The ball feels ok, but kind of cheap, it might be real composite leather but the ball itself feels thin and cheap. Oh, and BTW the ball was pumped up and bounces correctly upon response... i hope this helped i just wanted to reveal some secrets. :)"
4,The Vatican Exposed,"As much as I am still a committed Catholic, it's disheartening to learn of the past scandals of the Church. No wonder we're in the predicament we're in."
4,a great book,"In its expose of Vatican intrique, particularly as it pertains to pre-World War II, this book is exceeded only by Lucien Gregoire's ""Murder in the Vatican."" Both books are very much history books and both are written to the maker's mark."
3,worth watching,"Don't wanna say much about the movie but... the tiger scene is just straight up fake, I did not like the story line, but it was definitely entertaining and you just wanna keep watching until the end.Would've rather rented this though."
5,awesome,I love martial art movies expecially those that take place decades or even centuries ago. This movie doesn't disappoint. Bows and arrows I love it.
5,"Better than ""The Hunger Games""","Having seen news reports that interest in archery has dramatically increased since the release of ""The Hunger Games,"" I would suggest that ""War Of The Arrows,"" would start an archery epidemic. Comparing the two films is like arguing that ""Dumb and Dumber"" is better than ""The Godfather."" One is simple (not to suggest stupidity) and the other is complex (without being difficult to understand).If archery is your thing, ""The War Of The Arrows"" will completely satisfy that hunger. If you want nothing more than a great entertainment, you will not regret the time invested."
3,it was a good book,I mean the book was not bad and it was well written.I love the caracter of Philippe because he isn't like every teenager boy.He is sensible and caring.
2,Obnoxiously Big!! (and mine made noise),"I guess I could have reviewed the dimensions more carefully, but this water fountain is huge! I had the previous non-platinum version prior to this and this is much much bigger especially because of the reserve tank. Pro: you don't have the fill the fountain as much, but next to my cat's food bowl, it's obnoxiously big.Also, my previous drinkwell (non-platinum) did not make any noise when in use, however when I set mine up, motor on mine was very discernable. I have the water fountain in my bedroom and I purchased this product b/c of it's ""silent motor"", but mine was not quiet and I had to send mine back.Perhaps my shipment was defective, because other friends I have talked to said that their fountain was silent, however I did not want to take another chance with a $40+ product."
5,JUST PURCHASED MY THIRD FOUNTAIN!,"I am always taking in stray cats/kittens -- so over the years I've had alot! Most recently a mom cat(a kitten herself) gave birth to 4 kittens behind my house, & since I feared for their safety I took them all into my basement. After becoming attached to them & finding homes for 2 of them, I decided to let the remaining ones join my family of 4 already. Since the feeding & watering gets to be alot these fountains are perfect!! I just have to clean them out once a week & because of the large capacity of the reservoir the water supply usually lasts a week. All my cats love the fresh clean running water & are waiting in line on cleaning day for the fountains to start up again. They are worth every penny to make my spoiled kitties happy. My joy is in watching them!!"
1,To much cleaning,"We have three cats, and this thing gets slimy in less than a week.And forget about putting that cat grass in it. The roots take over the bottom and the slime gets worse.Not a good product if you are not home most days and nobody else wants to take it apart and clean it."
4,"Noisy an potentially messy, but awesome","We've had the fountain for a little over a month and so far it's been working really well. Our cat was a little wary of it at first, but within a few minutes was up and sticking his paws in the pool. Before he would only drink out of a dripping bathtub faucet, so this saves us a lot of time walking in and out of the bathroom to turn the faucet on and off. The only way I think he'd like it better is if there were a setting that made the fountain drip instead of stream.It's a little noisier than I would like, but both you and the cat get used to it after awhile. Also, plugging in a full reserve tank can be a bit messy, but overall it's a great product. I would recommend it to anyone with a water-loving cat."
4,good water fountain,"2 of my kitties love it, other one taking her time. My boy cat doesnt seem to drink from it tho... just likes to play with the stream with his head..."
1,Trying to make Lemonade!,"We have purchased other Drinkwell products and have been very satisfied with them. I think we got a lemon this time. We set up the fountain and it worked properly the first day but, at some point overnight, the vacuum holding the water in the reservoir released and we found the counter and floor covered in water. We checked all the parts and the assembly of same and tried again several times but were not successful in getting the water to remain in the reservoir for even a few minutes. The seller attempted to correct the problem but to no avail. Please don't let this review sour your opinion of the entire Drinkwell line or even this product! I hope to purchase another of the Platinum Fountains at a later date and find it perfected. In the meantime we purchased one of the other Drinkwell fountains that has worked for us in the past and it is working perfectly!"
1,Pump broke within 3 months,"I bought the water fountain less than 3 months ago, and was very happy with it. Finally yesterday, after using it for less than 3 months the pump stopped. I had a similar fountain (different brand) for years, and never had a problem (besides loosing it when I moved). This one is a big disappointment."
3,Great - until pump lost its ooomph,"Trying to find manufacturer info - about 4 months the pump has lost most of its power and I get barely a trickle. Washed, filter replaced, and so I wonder why it stopped. The animals love the fountain, but not since it stopped operating properly."
1,noisy pump,"The pump started out being fairly quiet with very little vibration. After only a week of usage, the pump noise become unbearably loud and the whole unit shook from how much the pump was vibrating. My cat refused to drink from such a noisy fountain and would only drink when the fountain is unplugged. I tried taking the whole unit apart, including disassembling the pump, and cleaning the parts, but nothing worked. Also the way the water stream hit the bottom of the unit would always cause some splashing. The flying specks of water further discouraged my cat from drinking from it.Now the fountain is sitting in a cardboard box, catching dust in a corner of my room."
1,You get what you pay for is not true in this instance!!!!,"Okay, I am a crazy dog mom. I want the best for these two guys and so I read the reviews and thought this was going to give them good, healthy water. Well, first, they were scared to death of it, they got over that and started to use it. The worst and second point is, it gets junked up with slime, dirt and God knows what!!! I clean it every couple of days and take it totally apart to do this and still it's gross!!! I am so unhappy I spent this money on such a horrible item!!!!! Skip it."
2,worked great... for the first few days,"CONS: This fountain leaks from the bottom, We had to buy a tray to set it into so that it would not ruin our hardwood floors. I have to stop the fountain at least twice a day to dump out the water inthe tray so it does not over flow. I have contactedthe company directly about the problem. They were not friendly at all and told me that I would have to pay to ship it back to them, and let them inspect it before they would replace any parts on the fountain that may or may not be under the warranty. Yep, like I am going to do that.....Also, having something electronic sitting in water so it doesnt leak all over my floor.... huh? you do the math. Also the motor stops about every 3 days, so I have to clean it out all of the time. If you want a high maintenance, messy water dish... this product is for you....PRO: Our cat does love this fountain. Thats about it."
3,works great at first then it keeps overflowing,"When we first received the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain it worked great. About 6 weeks into using the product it would start overflowing. I clean it completely every time I refill it, which is about every 2 days. I do not know what else to do. I do not have the box it came in so I can not return it. I am very unhappy about the out come of this product. My cat loves the free flowing water."
5,I like this fountain...,"because our cat, Scuba the dumpster diver, drinks from the stream and I can hear it, I know he's drinking like he should. I don't know if he ""loves"" it, he's Siamese and hasn't learned English, but when the power went out during the last hurricane he looked like he'd lost his best friend.Yes, I spill water on the floor getting it from his placemat to the sink, that's what towels are for, and yes filling the reservoir and getting it on the fountain without spilling any can be iffy, but not spilling any has become a goal. But if this fountain gets Scuba to drink more and stay healthy, well I'm there.Update: We've had this drinking fountain for more than a year and I've discovered other benefits to this, the water noise is relaxing and with the added little bit of moisture in the air my nose doesn't bleed in the winter."
5,Way better than the Original,"I bought this after the Original Pet Fountain started to leak @ the motor. I read other reviewers which said the same and advised to use silicone but I wouldn't risk having the silicone run into the water and right thru my cats' tummies, so i decided to purchase the Platinum. Not only it comes with the reservoir which the original didn't but removing, the motor to clean it is way easier than trying to remove the motor from the Original One. I really give this 2 thumbs up."
3,"Cats love it, but always dirty","I have owned this fountain for a while now. First of all, my cats love drinking from this fountain. They like the sound of the splashing water and that it is constantly filtered (no food bits in the water they are actually drinking).My biggest issue is that I cannot clean it completely. I do not know why they designed it with so many sharp points (they hurt!) and corners (cannot clean all the growths that form over time). I suppose if you were to clean it every other day or so, those growths would not form, but that is unreasonable (it takes a good 15 minutes to clean thoroughly).I will definitely keep on using a fountain, just not this one. I noticed in the store that one called ""CatIt"" seemed to have a more simple design (easier to clean), though I will check the reviews first!"
5,This is certainly NEW AND IMPROVED !!,"Actually didn't pay attention to anything other than buying another Drinkwell Fountain. Extremely pleased with it, just wanted one more. When the Platinum Fountain came, I liked it, then set it up and was impressed with the improvements. Holds more water, easier to put together after cleaning, and much quieter. The cats took about 20 seconds to get over being scaredy cats, and love it. Glad I have it. Will probably by another one."
4,So far so good,"So far it working great, the only thing that I didn't give a 5 stars, it because sometime the motor making noise.I have to adjust it to make it quiet again."
3,awful motor and slimy product!,"we had this fountain for over a year, replaced the motor twice. it was such a pain to clean, with all the crevices and nooks and crannies! it would get slimy very quickly and needs to be cleaned once a week, which, once again, is really a pain in the butt to do. the cats loved the water flow but once it got dirty they would go back to the sink faucet and whine for that, avoiding the fountain until we cleaned it. the filters aren't cheap either - 3 for $15 at petco. if they made this product in ceramic with a simpler design for the inside and a more reliable motor (the second time it died, the power went out due to a storm and the motor just didn't turn back on after that) i would be a happy camper. until then, i will search for another product for my gatos.camper"
2,Ended up Replacing It!,"I did use this fountain for a couple of years, so I'm not complaining about its construction or design. My cats love drinking from a fountain. Mine liked it when I left the top piece off of this fountain. My complaint is that this one is made of plastic and gets slimey feeling after only a few days. Also, some cats (mine) suffer from chin acne and eating/drinking from plastic can aggrevate this condition. It does go thru the dishwasher, so if you don't mind cleaning it every few days, it is a good fountain and has a bigger resevoir than most. I ended up replacing it with a ceramic fountain that stays cleaner much longer and no more chin acne."
4,Very nice,This is awesome for our two furry friends! They also love the fact they can kind of take a bath! Love sticking their heads under the stream!
3,Good except for the vibration,"I'm sure others have mentioned this, but the motor vibration is excessive. I moved it, adjusted it, and fiddled with it trying to get the vibration noise down. In the end, I had to discontinue use due to the loud noise. Otherwise, it is a good product."
3,"Splashes water onto the floor easily, like the original better","I owned 2 of the original Drinkwells with the 50oz water reservoir, but, we lost them during a move. One of my cats recently had some problems with a UTI so, I ordered this Drinkwell Platinum. I decided to go with this one as this had a built-in reservoir. I wish I had ordered the original one. This one isn't bad, but, the bowl rim on this one seems to be lower than the original. Even if I don't fill the reservoir this one will splash out onto the floor surrounding the bowl. I have to keep a towel wrapped around the bottom to soak up the water. I turned down the flow to the lowest it would go, and it still splashes out. Though, other than that it's a good product."
3,"Some cats may love it, but ended up being more trouble than just changing a bowl","Initially this was really nice, but it tended to get even dirtier than a bowl for some reason. It was also kinda noisy, so noisy that one of my cats refused to go near it. The noise also meant i had to keep it in the laundry room or it would keep me awake at night. The grate between the front and rear sections would get clogged with some kind of goop (maybe wet lint dust from the laundry room?), causing the front section to overflow in a couple of days. I ended up having to clean this at least once a week, as well as the floor around it due to the overflow problem. Turns out that just keeping a clean bowl of water in the kitchen is easier, quieter, and cheaper."
2,"Works gr8 but, impossible to replace pump","I love this pet fountain and so does my cat and my dogs but,you cannot find a replacement pump.Someone said the, ""Sunterra 104506"" is a compatible replacementpump, NO IT'S NOT.Buy a pet fountain where you will not have difficulty buyinga replacement pump."
3,Calico Cat,"I thought this would have been a great idea for my cat but unfortunetly, my cat did not like it. It was too big and the light humming noise kept her away from it."
2,Dogs and cat not impressed,"I have had this ""Drinkwell"" for about 4 months now, and my 4 dogs and 1 cat aren't any more attracted to this as they are a regular bowl of water. I do believe the people who say it helped their dog or cat drink more, but for me, it was a waste of money. And it's much harder to clean than a regular bowl [ASIN:B002ZNKKF0 Drinkwell Platinum Fountain Mat, MAT-D2]]."
5,Cats Love It...,"It only took one day for my cats to fall in love with this. It does make some funny sounds at times, but no leaking, and it is easy to refill, and I have no trouble at all with the reservoir at all!! I have no regrets buying this fountain."
5,Best pet fountain,I've owned other pet fountains but I like this one best. The reservoir that hold the water is much larger than others and it's very quiet. Just one recommendation for any pet fountain: Use bottled water!! Tap water has too much iron or calcium build up over time. The cost of bottled water is so cheap compared to continued replacement of the pump and filters.
1,"On second Platinum, and this one is failing again.","My two cats love the Drinkwell Platinum fountain. I have been very fastidious about keeping it clean, making sure there is no algae, and changing the filters.The first fountain failed after about 14 months of use. I contacted the manufacturer, who informed me the pump had failed, the item was out of warranty, and essentially I was out of luck- but they'd slightly redesigned the pump to make it easier to clean and so the failure rate was less. I threw away the first one and bought a second- and less than 9 months later, same problem.I won't recommend or purchase this item again, and will be looking for a replacement. I'm hoping to find an equally adequate product, as my cats have used this product since they were teeny kittens, and won't just drink out of a bowl now."
4,hydrate!,i bought this in hopes of discouraging my cat from jumping on counters and drinking from faucets. i believe it's accruately described. i think both my cat and dog drink more water now although the cat would still prefer to drink from a true faucet. one thing i dislike is it's inconvenient to clean but should be done weekly to avoid debris entering the motor. could be because my animals drink so little (they're both small) so always lots of water in fountain when time to clean.
1,Loud buzz,"I am unhappy with this product and would definitely return it had I not purchased it long time before I actually started using it. First of all, it produces loud buzz all the time, no matter what the level of the water, the position of the blade, no matter what.Most importantly though, my cat decided she did not like it and never used it once, even though she happily drank from the old Petmate fountain that I had before. I will buy Petmate again."
5,Second try. this one is good!,"The first one I bought leaked but Amazon promptly refunded my money. I've had this one a month and it works well. My spoiled cat won't drink enough water from a regular bowl and prefers the faucet. This is a good compromise and he gets more water. That's important for his health. It has a great water capacity and makes no noise except the soft sound of the water falling. No splattering, either."
3,Disappointment,"This Drinkwell has a generous water resevoir and I like the design but it is NOISY, too noisy. I don't recommend it and am seriously thinking of returning it."
3,"Not using it anymore, requires too frequent cleanings","I'm not overly picky but this was supposed to help cut back on my workload in the house (3 dogs, 2 cats, 3 boys and my husband) but after only a week or so I have to take it all apart and clean it really well, change filter, too, or the water has a stink to it that my cats won't go near. After about 4 days I can feel slime in the bowl and then the smell starts. I know how to clean it- and I use HOT water, mild soap and I dry it.Unfortunately, I procrastinated when deciding to return it and now it's way too far past return window. Lesson learned.I'm glad it seems to work so well for most everyone who has reviewed it, though!"
2,"Cats liked it, but it died too soon",The fountain was fine. The cats liked it. The pump died after only 6 months. I expect something at this price level to work longer than 6 months.
4,The Pets Love It,"Had the Drinkwell Platinum Fountain for 4 months now and it works absolutely great. My dog and my cat both love it. It's an easy set-up, easy to refill and clean. It can be a little loud but nothing you'd notice throughout the day, only in the evenings when things start to quiet down."
4,Better than a cereal bowl,"It's okay... Instead of changing the water every day or every other day, I now have to change it once a week AND scrub this thing out. It will save you some time, but if you are concerned about the water that your pets are drinking, this is not the miracle cure. The filter doesn't do much, so the water gets pretty slimy after a few days. Cleaning it requires a complete disassembly/reassembly and pipe-cleaner type tools. Give yourself 20 minutes once a week for scrubbing. However, the cats seem to like it, and probably prefer it over just a bowl, which probably means they are drinking more water. Our extra-full litter box seems to prove this point. Overall I would recommend, but don't get too excited. ;)"
2,Not what's pictured,"I ordered this as a replacement for one that was broken. The one I recieved was not as pictured and not of the same quality as the one I was replacing even though they are the same brand. I even researched jar ""1"" vs ""2 and 3"" and this should have been the correct one. I didn't feel like hassling with the company to return it so I just kept it as it matched well enough, but be forewarned."
5,Cute,"After several failed attempts at purchasing a spring loaded dixie cup holder for the bathroom, I decided to try this. Works so much better & looks nice too!"
1,don't buy it.,"It is a piece of junk.Useless product, can not imagine why somebody would build product like this, need to throw it in the trash."
4,Information all 20something females should know!,"If you skip the first 50 pages or so of this book, it's FABULOUS. The first few chapters are tidbits you could read in any glossy magazine about makeup, fashion, etc. But then the author, Anna Johnson, becomes inspired and adds in handy advice for 20somethings. Advice about what types of tools every girl should own, to dating technique dos & don'ts, to career & money advice. The section about credit card debt was helpful & greatly appreciated. This is not an intellectual read by any stretch but there is some useful information and funny side-notes from the author's personal experiences. I plan to lend it to all of my girlfriends."
2,Too broad; Not what it appears to be,I bought this book last year because I thought from the cover that it was a style guide. It's not. In fact it have very little to do with fashion or style.This book is Anna Johnson's advice about life. It covers everything from relationships to food to charity. It's way too broad and I am not sure why Ms. Johnson would be considered an expert in many of these areas. Because it's so broad the advice is generic.Ms. Johnson is a good writer and I have enjoyed her fashion writing elsewhere but this book is not for woman who have any common sense of their own. It might be good for teenagers.
2,Doesn't live up to expectations,"After reading the reviews that others left, I excitedly ordered this book & then impatiently waited for it to arrive. I dug in as soon as I got the package opened, but I was sorely disappointed when I read through it. To me, it was a very shallow book with very little of substance to it. I was looking for something that would truly be helpful to me in choosing clothing for my job, in getting relationship advice, in knowing how to be a success in my 20's........all I can say is that I am disappointed in myself for believing the reviews--that these things could be found in this book. I'd recommend checking it out of your local public library for free before buying it. That way, if you end up not liking it, you won't have wasted money on it like I did."
4,Definatly Worth the Money!,This is a great game! It is more than worth the mony! If you are planning on buying a game...BUY THIS!
2,eh,I have liked the smaller Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket. But this one doesn't seam to have the better umph I thought it would. With fresh batteries it just seams to go to much of a vibration to where you barely actually get good stimulation. This is my experience at least.
4,Great book for busy dads,This book is full of positive advice for expecting dads or dads with new babies... even if they've done it all before. The tips focus on the little things a dad can do to help his family thrive. The book is small and each page contains a single piece of advice so it is an easy read even for the busiest dad. Some of the advice is pretty obvious but is more of a reminder to actually DO the thing suggested. My husband thought this book was really great and so do I so we now own a copy. He works a lot and is always very busy but this book reminds him to make his family #1.
5,Still the ONE.,"After 31 years, I still refer to this book. I'll keep mending it until it disintegrates.You have to overlook some of Dave Marsh's sometimes questionable reviews. He didn't think much of the Eagles' Hotel California. And you should read what he opined about AC/DC, 32 years ago (it's funny). A great reference nonetheless for vinyl nuts like myself."
1,very dissapointed,"I remember one evening I went to Hastings Book and Entertainment I saw a DVD of USA's Dumbest Crooks and when I saw the price I couldn't believe my eyes and I instantly went and grabbed it, when I've gotten home I was dissapointed in it and I could've done without them repeating the same footage over and over and I also could've done without the quiz, plus it was nowhere near as long as the DVD claimed it to be, I'm thinking about selling it at a pawnshop and I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't sell well there, please don't waste your time on this excuse for a DVD"
3,Chaos;Head doesn't quite reach its goals,"I don't want to rag on the show too much because it is decent. Its got great atmosphere, an interesting premise, and some interesting character designs and personalities for the main cast. The problem comes in that Chaos;Head starts off strong with an intriguing mystery and bizarre behavior from the main character, but it fails to deliver any sort of satisfaction with its conclusion. The science is poorly explained, the main villain comes almost out of nowhere, and it isn't ever made clear what some of the characters' connections to the main plot or sub-plots were. The main problem with Chaos;Head is a lack of focus. If they had trimmed down the number of characters and steered the story to follow the main protagonist more often, then this would have been far more enjoyable. I still think people should watch this show, but I can't really recommend a purchase."
2,Very fuzzy closeups!!!,"I bought this camera for my daughter for her baby shower and am very disappointed. It is not up to par for the Nikon name. Point and shoot quality very nice, BUT any close shots taken were very fuzzy!!! Not good when shooting pictures of a newborn baby! Every roll developed had poor quality pictures of her."
2,A Look Back 320 Years,"I enjoy Shirley Jackson's writing style. I had high hopes for this book, but it fell short for me.It is a nonfiction title intended for readers ages 11 and up. Sadly, it is presented in such a dry fashion that I found myself constantly zoning out or skimming.Such potential missed. I wish Jackson had taken these people and occurrences and created a historical fiction piece likeYear of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague. I learned so much by reading that book. It stuck with me due to the vivid story telling.Young readers will have a tough time sticking with The Witchcraft of Salem Village. I suggest teachers and parents find another source for this topic."
4,Un buen libro!,"This book will make you smile no matter what language you read it in (this book is also available in English). Judy Snider tells the heartwarming tale of a little cat that mothers socks...so much so it gets a little crazy. Children, especially cat lovers and those who have been around momma cats, will delight in the way this story progresses until Goldy finally has real babies of her own. You'll be on the edge of your seat and laughing as the tension builds until at last there is a peaceful, happy ending and all is well again. I loved the watercolor illustrations; the author and illustrator make a great team bringing this story to life and fleshing it out so well. Will there ever be more stories with Goldy? I hope so! - Biblio Reads Children's Book Review"
1,Product is 2 weeks late...,"It isn't possible to Track the order and there has been no communication from them as to why the Textbook has been delayed. Meanwhile, class began over 2 weeks ago (I ordered the Textbook on 1/7 and I did not choose 7-14 day delivery, knowing school would be starting on 1/15/13)."
3,Nice companion to the book,"Scattershot selection of classic (well, most of them anyway) 1966 hits and some interesting audio-verite oddities, including the first CD release of the true version of the ""Batman"" theme as heard in the TV show's opening credits. Petula Clark fans will appreciate the live track from ""The Roger Miller Show"". Not in any way a comprehensive picture of Pop Culture 1966 (no black artists but the Capitols?!), but a nice sampler and a nifty companion to the highly-recommended book of the same name."
2,Hal Lifsons 1966,"I am a huge collector of 60's memorabilia! The idea of this cd is good but there is nothing original about the cd. I bought it and then returned it. It seems like Mr. Lifson is more worried about promoting Mr. Lifson than creating a unique project. I think he should concentrate on providing a project of rare 60's gems that were really cool but didn't make it!! This would give us serious collectors something different, original and worth collecting! Arthur Mallick..Chicago Illinois"
4,I Wish I would have seen it...,"I always kick myself for not seeing things and then listening to the cast recording and finding the show interesting. It's missing those great songs that were in Ragtime or Once On This Island (especially in Act II), but the melodies are pleasing (supported by great orchestrations) and the cast is fantastic."
4,a surprise hit :-),"After doing an Ahrens and Flaherty review at my university, I became drawn to the 2 songs ""The Streets of Dublin"" and ""Love Who You Love"". After the show closed, I got my hand on a copy of the whole musical and I haven't stopped listening to it for about a week.The ability of Ahrens and Flaherty to put you in such a distinct place and time is so evident here. The music and voices are about as Irish as you can get. Each of the singers are perfect, the stanadouts being Jessica Molaskey as Mrs Patrick, and Steven Pasquale as Robbie faye. My favorite songs in the recording have to be the two I already mentioned, ""Our Father"" and the haunting ""Confusing Times""No, it's not the multilayered, epic story of Ragtime, and it doesn't have to be. ""A Man of No Importance"" is a lovely, heart-wrenching story about a man looking for his honest place in the world, and will make a fine addition to your showtune collection."
2,Wrong item pictured!,"The photo for this shelf is wrong! Pictured is a 2U shelf with lip on the front. What arrived is a 1U shelf with no lip.The shelf that arrived is fine for my purposes, but beware if you needed the 2U version."
2,Crapmount Shelves,"These shelves are 10 inches deep, not 10 inches as advertised. This meant I have to take hack saw to the console I was installing them into. I have purchased 4 of these shelves (in one order or I would have bought more) and 2 had the rack ears bent when they arrived. However, the metal is so flimsy I couls bend them back with my hands."
4,Stupid Lip,I would give this a 5 star rating but the rack had a lip on it which did not fit my power conditioner. I had to get a saw to cut the lip so I could squeeze my conditioner in there and safely connect my plugs. Other than that the rack is sturdy and well built. Great rack as long as you don't need to modify the metal lips.
4,Solves the problem at low price,"I have an old kitchen sink in use as a utility sink in the basement. In the past, someone had installed boiler values as taps--intolerable--where a wall-mount faucet should have been. Unfortunately, wall-mount faucets are harder to find than I thought. And where you can find them, they are pricey. I was just looking for something basic. This was what I needed, and I'm glad I found it.The faucet looks better than I needed it to. It's a good buy. BUT:1. The spout on the faucet I received is different. The one in both Amazon's current picture and the picture on the box has a straight spout. The spout on the faucet I received is more curved and the treaded opening of the spout is more obliquely angled.2. There are no instructions with the faucet, which is too bad, because you cannot install this without a 15/16"" hex wrench. It really would have saved me a lot of time if that were indicated somewhere before I wanted to start."
4,LDR failed to include Product Manual,"For the missing service/install manual, Amazon referred us to a LDR- Maker/Distributor WRONG PHONE. We still have not solved this. All in all, item is a well made product of high quality!"
3,Good for first time racers,..but brings very little value if you have been in cycling for a while and experienced your first race already. I would suggest joining a good racing team instead
5,DO YOU RECYCLE?,"John Waters does it again with another classic that epitomizes his post-Divine era. Beverly R. Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) is an immaculate mother who recycles and listens to Barry Manilow. She lives in the Baltimore suburb with her dentist husband (Sam Waterston) and two children, Chip (Matthew Lillard) and Misty (Ricki Lake). Everything is seemingly normal except mom has some issues that she works out differently than most folks.The film oozes with satire of the modern vs. 50's family, the celebrity status we bestow on criminals, plus other topics. I liked the background details such as the monster models I remember having as a kid as well as the Spiro Agnew painting in the courthouse. There were numerous memorable scenes and lines as in most Waters' films. Worth owning.Parental Guide: F-bombs, magazine/movie nudity, weird sex scene."
4,Classically funny black comedy with 2 director tracks,"After my copy of the earlier DVD release of ""Serial Mom"" got damaged, I was happy to find this ""deluxe"" version had both the original commentary and a new ""dialogue"" commentary with Waters and Kathleen Turner. Although there is overlap in ""insights,"" both are priceless, not to mention the film itself - Waters' comic take on the ""crimes"" of suburbia..."
1,this is the second one i bought and it was messed up in the same place,i bought this dvd twice three monthes apart when i got them home they were so bad they wont even play. i hope you wont buy them as they are a rip off. i really want to see this dvd but i guess it wasnt meant to be. buyer beware
3,3.6 stars really....,"This game was pretty good single player. Although the game itself was pretty short you can beat it in one day, if you put the effort into it. The only thing that makes the game take as long as it does is the fact that some parts of some levels are too difficult/confusing. I do not reccomend buting this game, ecspecially if you already have Halo or Agent Under Fire. I reccomend renting this game. The Multiplayer is better than Agent Under Fire, but not as good as Halo or Medal of Honor:Frontline (for XBOX). All in all do not buy unless you are a die hard 007 Bond fan and this game is on sale."
5,pretty cool game,The coolest thing about this game is that you have multiple choices to solve a problem.It's a pretty cool game.I recomend it
4,Good game,"When i first started playing this game i was really amazed on how good this game was. Overall this game deservs 4 stars because this game has awsome graphics, super guns and good gadgets, but this game is too short! I beat this game in 4 days! this game would be almost better than Halo only if it had more missions. you shouldnt buy this game if you think you will be playing this game for a long time."
2,This is no Goldeneye:,"What happened? Goldeneye was incredible and kept my friends/family and I entertained for years. What the people of Xbox should do is copy Goldeneye, and just add some better graphics with the awesome capabilities of the big black/green box, then I would be glad. I bought this game hoping it would be better than Agent Under Fire (which I used to own, and beat), but nope, <weep>. Here are some pros and cons:Props-great graphics-neat new guns-Bond actually looks like. . .Bond-good multiplayer (not great)-neat vehicles and gadgetsCons-a little bad language-references to sex-bad gameplay-computer is too smart,"
5,it works,"I love this stuff. it makes my hair less frizzy, and it makes my hair feel smooth, shiny and healthy. Doesnt weigh hair down or feel sticky. it's great stuff. Just spray it on before you dry your hair. Highly recommended."
1,I can't get this crap out of my hair now!,"I used this product a several times, just a few pumps on the ends, and use a round brush to dry my hair. The brush transferred this product to all my hair and now my hair constantly looks and feels greasy. I have shampooed at least 15 times and twice washed my hair with vinegar to try to get it out and it's still there. When I touch it, it leaves a sticky greasy feel on my fingers. I am going to have to go to the salon to try to get it out. I hate this product. Die, John Frieda!"
3,Covers old ground,"I have been learning VB6 on and off for about 1 year now. I am teaching myself via books, I bought the ""Programming in visual basic 6.0"" by the same aurthors to start with. That book I found to be excellent, and started me on projects. I decided to buy ""advanced Programming in visual basic 6.0"". This book is also good and easy to follow, however, alot of the content is almost identicle to the first book, I would say 60% of this book is covered in the previous edition. Three stars for teaching what I already have been tought by the first book."
3,OK book; only advanced topics,"This book was the text book in college for my class. It is an above average book. If you go through the exercises, you will know the subjects well. My suggestion would be, if it is part of your curriculum, then you buy it. If you are really into learning advanced VB or VB.NET, I suggest Deitel series."
1,47th Street Photo Purchases,I found the lens I ordered was not described accurately. Repeated calls to 47th provided more bum dope. I returned the lens to them AT MY EXPENSE (no return postage paid return sticker was provided) and still got hit with a $15 restockage charge.
4,It's easy to use!,"I am a novice griller, but this Weber grill is great! I admit, I do need some help in controlling flame/heat, but it is fairly easy with this grill. I do admit, that even though clean up is fairly easy, when sweeping the ashes from the grill into the catch pan, not all of the ashes make it into the pan. The one-touch system doesn't allow a thorough ""clean sweep"" of the area, so, you're left with remnants of ashes that have to be pushed close to the holes so that the one-touch system finally can sweep them away. All in all, though, this is a great grill for a novice and for the experienced griller."
1,Check the shipping costs before buying,"While this seems to be a good price, the shipping markup seems a bit high. Amazon is charging $139 to ship this product, $40 more than if you order directly from their supplier Dynadirect. If you search you can find the grill elsewhere for as low as $185 with the more realistic shipping charge of $39.99."
5,Marber beats Mamet,"Somebody to watch, Marber is equally skilled as an author and a director, succeeding where Mamet was lukewarm on ""The Old Neighborhood"" in London's West End. Come see it at Steppenwolf in Spring 1999, I myself saw it once in London and twice on Broadway. Caution on the language however, not for the faint of heart."
1,don't buy this,"This game is badly designed, it runs VERY SLOW and VERY glitchy, the career mode will not keep up with your ability and there is no reason to waste your money on this . Unless you absolutely must fantasize about having Tiger Woods as a virtual partner.dont bother investing in it."
5,Good Sub,Iv had 2 of these in my subaru outback for a year now. play them with a 750w max 400rms crunch amp. and i blast them every day for at least 60 min++ and they still kick as good as the day i got them. love them. deff recommend!
1,Yuck. Psychotherapist Buys Haunted House + Evil Boyfriend.,"This story was boring and not even written believably, with boring characters and only a vague description of its interesting setting, Haight St in San Francisco. The main crux of the whole matter is that something terrible happened in this bargain of a house the psychotherapist main character buys. And surprise, surprise, it's devil worship--perpetrated by her inexplicably irresistable new boyfriend who is also her younger sister's mentor."
3,mobile business PLUS,"like the bag ok, but it's way fatter than I imagined it'd be. great if you want to haul extra clothes as well as your laptop / portable office."
3,An Average Title.,"Blah. We hear the word all the time after we get done watching someone play the new Bond game at our local gaming store. All gamers hope for the time when a true Goldeneye will be made. Most Playstation 2 owners played Goldeneye on their old 64 and most of us played it nearly non-stop. It was a great game. However, once EA took over production of the games, they all have been average titles. Granted the game does have a smooth framerate, and gorgeous graphics, but something is just missing. For example the multiplayer aspect of the game is poor just as the previous Agent Underfire. You can see that EA has made an attempt to try to make the game more like Goldeneye by using the famous ""Watch Health"". Overall I think that only the die hard FPS fans should pick this up, otherwise just go with Time Splitters 2 or Medal of Honor:Frontline."
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled, this game sucks. I got it for my birthday last year, and it doens't match up to 007: Goldeneye (one of the best games ever made), so don't be fooled"
5,Very useful guide - minor tweaks in Paris,"Just got back from France, where I carried this travel guide with me all the time (slightly bulky, but good to save some money and get only one travel guide for all of France). Overall, guide is great, giving insights on many different attractions, and even helping save time by drawing attention to key things to see in each attraction. The only setback was in Paris, where the map included doesn't show the area around Gare du Nord (the station where the Eurotrain arrives), which also includes the Sacre-Coeur church (beautiful, by the way)."
5,A must for traveling this region,"I was introduced to the Eyewitness series when our family traveled to New York City. I find these guides indispensible, and great reading. The maps and illustrations helped me, an compulsive planner, to be comfortable with the travel plans even before arriving in France. During the journey, it helped me with key phrases of the language, and with being confident of directions. The iillustrations are so very thorough, that you seem to have a 'feel' for where you are at the moment. Using an Eyewitness Guide before travel, I feel prepared and ready to enjoy the destination. After returning home, the Guide is an excellent way to share your experience with others."
5,Great tasting K-cups,My favorite of the bold K-cups. Strong coffee that still tastes good and it is organic.
1,Poorly sealed k-cup container,"I've given only one star, not because of taste (which is very bold and flavorful), but because of the poorly sealed container. The last two k-cups tried, the seal broke during use and spewed coffee grounds. The cup of coffee was ruined, and the Keurig k-cup coffee maker required a thorough cleaning before its next use. We've been using our coffee maker for last 14 months, multiple times per day, with a variety of coffees. However, the problem as experienced, was limited to the Coffee People Extra-Bold organic. The cause of problem: the seal was not properly centered on the cup during manufacturing process, leaving a small gap that exposed the coffee grounds. I love this coffee's flavor and hope its manufacturer gets the container-seal problem fixed--for good! Next time, I will open the box of k-cups at the store to make sure there are no defects, as described. Or, if I've purchased them through Amazon.com, I will ask for a refund."
2,Verbose,"Overall, I liked the story of the book, however, it took too long to tell the story. Perhaps, I wanted more of a salacious read, but the overly dramatic whining and pining, really struck me odd and annoyed me so much that I began feeling like I was reading, ""Anne of Green Gables"" instead of a book written by one who attended a military school. It was priced OK for me, but I wouldn't purchase it again, if I had the opportunity to do so."
3,Civil War history,This book had some good information as my ancestor was in the battle with the Ninth Pa. Cav.
3,WILD THING IN THE WOODS,"I started watching this movie with some reservations. Another boring erotic thriller would pass before my tired eyes. Then the strangest thing happened . . . I actually started to find myself ensnared in the various double crosses occuring onscreen. I soon also found myself wondering who the traitor was amongst the family -- I gussed wrong and I'm usually pretty good at guessing these things. Anyways, to sum it up, WILDFLOWER is a crafty erotic thriller -- with plenty of both.Unfortunately, the last few minutes (where the film should have ended) become both confusing and unlikely. Still, if you feel like watching a superior erotic thriller, WILDFLOWER should suit you just fine."
2,"Should be titled ""Mid Century Chairs and little else""","If you are looking for a book on Mid Century Chairs, look no further. I however was searching for a book on furniture not exclusive of chairs. The book is well organized and informative, but it was not what I was looking for."
5,Excellent Yoga mat,"This mat has helped my yoga practice. Many of the poses are much more comfortable. This is particularly true for some of the poses that put pressure on my knees,ankles,and feet. It is very ""sticky"" and my standing poses feel very stable. It is expensive but I would purchase it again in a heartbeat. I think it is an excellent mat for any level of yoga enthusiast. Jade Yoga's commitment to the environment was also important to me."
4,Happy with mat,"It needs to air outside for a few weeks to make the rubber smell less. Otherwise, I love everything about this mat.Jade Fusion 74-by-5/16-inch Yoga Mat"
2,Great track selection but poor mixing and volume,"I'm a Dj and own most of these tracks on vinyl, there are few CD collections of old school electro tracks available, so why Oh why do almost all of them have to be botched :( Yes the track selection has a good line up but thats where it ends. They never seem to mention in the description if these CD's are mixed, this one is. Some of the mixing is a little off beat and the songs are not leveled the same, so when one song is mixed into another and the first song is turned off the song that is now playing sound lower and feels out of place. Also the songs sound bland and are not direct master transfers. If your a dj looking to build your collections with full lenght separate tracks, skip this cd (and the 2nd Vol as well). If you just want a strole down memory lane this CD might work for you."
1,"B & D junk, buy chinese after market if you can","2nd charger fried & each was with new battery. I knew I should have not bought Black & Decker to begin with but I did because it was low priced. The charger is not engineered well which leads to resisters overheating and either harming charger wimpy circuit board or battery. If you can find a charger that is not B & D branded you will be better off as the electronics/circuits in this one is about as cheapo as it can get so you cant do any worse. Myself? I have resorted to using an adjustable adapter & taping wires to battery. So far that has been better performance than the actual Black & Decker brand charger. Its not amazons fault or sellers fault here, just B&D brand bad engineering."
5,I like,"Ive always like von zipper glasses, I will always recommend them to anyone that asks. Better than any other pair I've had."
4,Awesome,"Great recording of the origins of Death,Black,Speed,Thrash,etc. metal. Only disappointing item is...""Acid Queen"" is the 12""vinyl recording included w/the bonus tracks. The cassette i bought as a child included ""Acid Queen"" w/the rest of the main tracks."
4,Basic book on climatology,A good compilation on climate science. basic to understand and learn from. Useful at times.
5,Rock meets demolition durby-ish teen angst,"Charlie Sheen and Nick Cassevettes play rivals to their maximum potential. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and love watching it over and over. The characters are non-forgetable and the love story between ""Jake/Jaime"" and Sheryl Lynn Fenn's character are played out perfectly. This is one of those 80's movies that you won't soon forget."
2,The Wraith = Wasted Time,"Weird space guy goes to Arizona, wants the hot girl of the town. Burger guy befriends him. Local gang up to no good, weird space guy eradicates one by one. Inexplicable indestructible car, space guy is everywhere. Once gang is killed, weird space guy takes hot girl away on motorcycle after giving indestructible car to burger guy."
4,eighties sci fi flick,"If you enjoy eighties sci fi movies you enjoy this one. A boy is killed by a local race car gang. Comes back as a super natural being. Uses a souped up superfuture istic vehicle. Gets revenge on those who murdered him. And even gets to be with the girl he fell in love with at the end. Fantastic special effects for the eighty's, along with seeing some really cool cars. You don't want to miss this 1 check it out."
2,Disappointing replay,"When I was a kid, I thought this film was awesome. Funny how things turn out when you give it enough time."
3,The Wraith,This movie is a hard one to find...I have been looking for it to buy for a long time and now I have found it. If you have a copy of it then you better hold on to it...you never know when someone wants to buy it.Carrie
2,The Wraith,"Finally!! Thank you Mr Franco for letting me know that you are looking for the Soundtrack of ""The Wraith"" also. I hope you have better luck than I did. From what I've be told the soundtrack is no longer in print and I can't seem to find it anywhere. I, especially, liked ""(Hold on) Blue Eyes"".Films like these back then were alittle hokey and highschoolish but had great soundtracks.My favorite actorin this movie was Randy Quaid. What a talent. If anyone has ANY idea on how to get the soundtrack to ""The Wraith"" please, please,please, let me know."
3,"Great movie, but lackluster special features.","The movie itself is great. If you like revenge movies, this is certainly one for you.My problem with this DVD is that the special features are a bit lackluster. The commentary, in particular, is very sparse, covering only about 10% of the movie and only dealing with some technical aspects, such as how the chase scenes were filmed to make them look like they're going faster than they are. There is very little actual commentary on the movie's context, or most of its content. You probly won't learn anything you don't already know from this commentary.Also, the featurette on the Turbo Interceptor is indicated to have a segment about the restoration of the actual car, but in fact, only makes passing comment on it. This and the ""Rughead Speaks"" featurette provide more insight than the commentary, but are mainly about the technical aspects of the movie and the careers of the people involved."
5,"Style,Fit,Function,Price.","The HKS Plain, Double Speed loader Case Medium is the perfect solution for the Ruger LCR 38 Special five shot revolver.It is as advertised.For the price, Fit and Function, is Superb.I am more than pleased, money well spent, I will purchase two more.I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone.As usual, AMAZON shipping and Customer Service is Outstanding.This IS the reason I shop with them.Best Regards,Billie R Hobbs."
5,Medium is great for HKS .38/.357 A-series speed loaders,"The fit is close, but there is room to spare. I gather that the large size must be for .44 mags and larger. The cylinder on the GP100 is pretty damn big for a 6 shot .357 mag and both this and the A-series HKS .38/.357 speed loaders work just fine."
5,HKS Plain Double Speedloader Case,Really nice case and does exactly what its supposed to do which is hold speedloaders. Quality is decent and should last for as long as I need it.
5,Excellent Speedloader Case,I am very happy with this speedloader carrier. It is very well made and fits perfectly. Of course it is not meant for competition shooting but I highly recommend it to anyone who needs good retention for their speed loaders.
4,"Contrary to the ""product description,"" the HKS Speedloader Case DOES NOT HAVE velcro fasteners","For some of us, having velcro fasteners is important because speedloaders vary in height. A case with velcro, even with decorative buttons for the flaps, would be perfect. But a case with with actual snap buttons, instead of decorative ones with velcro underneath, does not fit all speedloaders. Depending upon which speedloader that you carry, your ammo can rattle while you are carrying it. I'm giving the case 4 stars because now I have to buy some velcro and make the effort to add the velcro to it. Anyone can do this. But if the case is advertised as having velcro, and it is, why shouldn't the velcro come with it and already be attached?"
2,"Great concept, unstable tecnology",Its great to carry your music anywhere but this ipod software is a littlebit unstable and slow. Had to use warranty for replacement as it stopped working suddenly.
3,Good item but battery is weak,"Everything works pretty well, but the battery doesn't hold a charge for as long as it should. The headphone plug in is a little shaky sometimes too. It is an ancient version so considering that it has been kept in pretty good shape. It's not bad."
4,Apple iPod 20 GB White,"Didn't work at first, banged it on the table now it works fantastically. Battery doesn't last as long as advertised."
1,2 failed hard drives after the second day of usage,"If I could give this product 0 stars I would.I purchased an iPod for my birthday. The second day it is laggy. I try to reset it. I get the infamous exclamation folder screen which is equal to the blue screen of death to PC people. So I send it back and get a brand new one. The same exact thing happens. I follow all the instructions given, haven't dropped either once, and it breaks twice.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.Go to different electronics stores and ask around for better mp3 players. That's what I'm doing. It may look cute. It may look stylish. Fight the hype. I'm learning that lesson the hard way."
1,Save Your Money and you could buy a car!!!,"[...] this thing costs a fortune. I hate it. Its the same as the other mp3s out there, but they charge like a thousand dollars more!! Well, ok like two hundred. I could make payments on my car for less than that. I have an ok car, 2005 Nissan Xterra, but i cant drive it yet!!!! Its not even better than other models. Other players have more features, better quality, and a price tag with only like three digits. I returneedd all three of my ipods, and bought a zen micro with the money, and saved the rest of it, like twelve hundred dollars!!!Down With Ipod!!!"
1,Don't buy used if you can afford it.,"I loved each of my iPods dearly...Dearly. Over the past 7-8mo I have bought 5 different ones. Each one did the dreaded ""sad ipod"" face either immediately or within a few days. My most recent one lasted a few months, miraculously. They all stopped functioning out of nowhere; I never dropped or hit any of them to cause this. Evidently the previous owner(s) did not take care of the ipod themselves. I would not recommend buying this used, and if you do, please buy a Squaretrade.com warranty. That saved me my money the 2 times I was unable to return my ipod to the seller."
2,bad color screen,"I got my iPod about 1 month ago, allready I've found all the disadvantedges to it:Can't diplay pictures,only store themcan't display file (not even word files)HAS TERRIBLE SCREENto conclude I WOULD RECOMMEND THE IPOD MODLE MA079LL/A because you can display at least pictures"
1,NOT Worth It!!!!,Okay so I got this for christmas when it was still worth a lot it was around 300.00 and it worked and worked until around March. It just started getting stuck on hold when it was never on hold and freezing I tried restoring it and I called the company. The man was really nice but they try to trick you into buying a new warrenty. They told me that it had been over 3months and that the warrenty had expired but I had the paper saying 1 year warrenty he said thats for being able to call and that i needed to buy a new warrenty for 59.99. This ipod is not worth one penny. I explained that it started to show a picture of an ipod with a sad face and he told me ipods dont do that. i wasnt lying I am currently saving for a 30gb video ipod and i will be buying everything nescessary and keeping everything that way the ipod will look new when it breaks and they cant say i dropped it. NOT WORTH IT
3,Formarly Enthusiatic Owner,"I absolutely loved my 4G 20GB Ipod, I used it every day and every where. I always had it in the case and treated it very gently, and then, IT UP AND BROKE! I have only had this thing for four months, and it worked fine with only the occasional minor quirk, and suddenly I turn it on and it froze, shut down, and didn't come on anymore. Also, it made this clicking sound and got really hot. I went to apple support and tried everything they suggest, and nothing worked. Would I recommend the Ipod? I dont know, I'll have to see how helpful Apple is and how quickly I can get the product repaired or exchanged. Then I'll have to see if this happens again to me, and how likely it is to happen to someone else. Oy Vey, a month ago I would have written a stellar positive report on this thing (of course with the exception of the inexcusably short battery life)."
1,Marketing Miracle = Nightmare for Consumers or IPOD Woes,"Well, I fell into the marketing trap, lured by the hype of hip-ness and paid the price. At first my eyes gleamed as brightly as the brushed metal on my new wonder-gadget and then the stark reality crept in dimming my joy. IPOD is another fun to look functionless product from company that makes their products cute so you won't bother asking if it will work well for years. Soprt of like that Sharper stuff. Sadly, after only a few months my IPOD gave up the ghost and spirited my collection of music with it. When I sat down to figure out how many hours it took to transfer my collection of music and then lose it before I even had an opportunity to listen to each of my favorites once, well we just leave it at that. In fact it took longer to transfer all the music than I had to listen to it after I filled the disc. SO I SAY... USE YOUR HEAD AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WORKS FOR MORE THAN A MONTH AND WHEN YOU FIND IT LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BUY ONE TOO!"
4,i LIKE my IPOD.,"I got a 20 back in January of 05 and had the battery replaced on the 1st of Febuary because it stopped charging. apple payed for it though. it scratches really easy. those who are complaining about it freezing. . . Hold menu and the select button at the same time for about 30 seconds to 45 seconds or until it shuts off, it will then restart. i know what you guys are saying why should we even have to know this well we shouldnt because it shouldnt even have to do it in the first place, i plan on sort of up/downgrading to the 4GB Nano. Ipod 20 is ok."
4,An amazing product but...,"The iPod has everything one can wish for great sound quality, amazing portability and Apple's reliability.The ONLY thing wrong with it is that the front and the back metal casing scratch VERY easily. My recmmendation is that you by a case ASAP"
3,my review,"This is my first 20gb Ipod (I had a 10gb before which I loved) Unfourtunatly I have some bad luck with the model. I twice recived brand new models that had hardrive defects and had to return. I'm currently on my 3rd one within a month,not a good start.I still have faith in Apple, but they need to stay on top of quality control"
5,let the hottest item be a part of u,battery life is not as efficient but if u want to save some money get it free here http://tiny2go.com/1w sign up here and complete the videoprofessor offer
4,great product,"i really enjoy this product because it appeals to all of the Eurotrash and wannabees like myself. now i can be a cog in the wheel just like everyone else.i'm the guy who tries to be like everyone else by having an ipod and wearing Eurotrash clothing like versace, prada, and gucci. this ipod holds tons of ludacris and technojams just like the clubs in berlin. buy it now."
2,iPods: A huge waste of money,"Don't waste your money on an ipod. It is extremely overpriced for the quality it delivers. There are mp3 players that hold just as much and are of much better quality than an ipod and cost hundreds less. I've had my ipod for about a year and the battery drains over time. Fully charged, I get about 2 hours of music from my ipod before the batterys dead. No EQ or backlight on. It was about 12 hours of battery life when I first got it. AND APPLE IS CHARGING 59 DOLLARS TO GET THE BATTERY REPLACED!!!! Thats pure BS. Why should I pay nearly $60 dollars so they can fix their own mistake!!!! Mine also shuts off at random times, in the middle of songs for no reason. This isn't just my ipod, my friends ipods have been having alot of issues too. Buy a Creative Zen, it's cheaper, better quality and has alot more features. JUST BECAUSE IT HAS THE APPLE LOGO ON IT, IT DOSN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO SHELL OUT 300 DOLLARS FOR THIS!!!!"
1,I was cheated out of my money.,"I bought this item thinking it was a great deal... $70 for a 20 GB iPod?! Come on! That's sweet! But it took forever for it to come (though I payed the price for next day delivery) AND on top of that... when I tried to put songs on it after I restored it... IT WOULDN'T WORK AT ALL! I am at a loss for words. This is the last time I ever purchase from this buyer and I will be more than wary next time I purchase items on Amazon. Sometimes, deals can be too good to be true."
1,piece of junk,this ipod will not restore it always says coruppt on it. i paid 65 bucks for junk and im not happy with this at all. i would give it no stars for the rip off
2,Didn't last,"Product was great at first, but only lasted a little over a year. It then died and couldn't be revived."
1,Circuit City - DON'T BUY,"i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city. when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out! simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier! the packing inside was in tatters. i didnt touch the product.i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box. they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost. then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up. a week passed but it was never picked up. the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!i'm at my wits end with this company. buyers BEWARE!"
1,Be Careful,"I got my 20gb iPod for christmas, and was thrilled. It worked fine with only a few problems up until recently. It froze, and now it won't even work, at all. And to make things worse, the service for the iPod is quite possibly the WORST customer service i've ever come into contact with. Theres no phone numbers, no email, just their website. Once there, you have to fill out forms, submit a repair request form, wait for them to look it over, send it in, get the iPod replaced with used parts from other iPods that didn't work at one point, then wait for it to be sent back. I highly suggest getting something else besides an iPod."
1,Dont buy refurbished electronics,I had the ipod for two weeks before it started malfunctioning. I sent it in for repairs (i had to pay shipping). I wish I bought a CD player instead.
3,Grips installed on my Kawasaki Vulcan VN750,"The left grip went on so easily I couldn't believe it, then came the right grip. Wow, what a pain in the neck. It took me almost an hour to shave and sand down the plastic on my throttle enough to get these to go on, but they are on. They look nice and my large size hands fit them well, the OE's were to small in diameter. Maybe some improvement in reducing vibration, but not as much as I expected or hoped for, still, very nice grips and certainly an improvement over the OE's."
3,missing last chapter,"missing last part of Peace with Honor, like watching a movie with the ending missing. What happened? Sure would like to see the end of what I thought was a well done documentary."
2,Confirms Murray as the greatest actor of the last 20 years.,"Although he is a shy cop, rather than his usual lunatic mobster, de Niro's Mad Dog here isn't so far from Travis Bickle in his urban alienation, his voyeurism, and his daily confrontation with evil. Where Travis was compellingly frightening, though, Mad Dog is a bit of a whimper. Although this is set up as a gladatorial conflict in acting styles, there is no contest - de Niro is on screen for too long, is too normal, and is thus allowed bore us; Murray, blandly evil, hilarious and bizarre, is tantalisingly withheld and thus inspires more of a craving. The whole thing feels flat."
5,Mad dog and glory,"Hey everybody, i just want to say how much i enjoyed this film the performances were outstanding!, especially De Niro's, I could watch any of his movies. If u aint seen this movie get out and rent it! its fantastic..and if Robert De Niro ever reads my reveiw *YOU R THE MAN!* :) I think this was one of his best movies throughout ninetys along with my personal favorites, Goodfellas, Casino & Jackie Brown....Big Robert De Niro Fan..."
5,Lots To Please,"This book is full of the author looking back on his most tender and special moments of funeral directing and also includes stories of notable individuals with funeral details, such as Milton Hershey, Martha Raye, Colonel Sanders and others. A really interesting read that does not necessarily need to be following chapter by chapter. Can be opened anywhere."
5,Live in London,"I've just recently acquired all her albums. This performance is before her recent release Transparente, (which I recommend). The performance is excellent and much better than most live performances on other DVD's. Her voice is strong, clear and emotive. Some of the arrangements are different from the album versions so it is not always a straight attempt to copy the CD version. I often listen to this because there really isn't much out there like it. Mariza is a popularizer of Fado so the stage is not like a Tavern in Lisbon but that doesn't take away from the captivating vocals. If people want to review this based on politics and her watching a bullfight in Lisbon (very Portuguese), they are going to miss out on one of the best acts in World music. BTW I always thought that Portuguese bullfighting didn't involve killing the bull."
3,"Love the chime, cover doesn't stay on","Works well, liked the choice of chime. I had my electrition install in new construction and the cover does not have anything to secure it to the base. It just hangs there and has been bumped off a couple of times. I will probably make a custom cover."
5,It couldn't get any better than this,"This has got to be one of the best James Bond games EVER! I got it for the Hoildays and boy dose it pack a punch. The game is much more realistic, the AI enmies react to what you do and are a lot smarter than before. Also my personal favrotie has to be the 5 levels, count them 5 LEVELS of the Aston Martin Vanquish. As you will see in the first level the game practicly plays it self.All in All it is a Great Buy"
4,Great first person shooter,"This is a great first person shooter. There aren't enough single player missions, but the main thing about this game is multiplayer. There are many characters, tons of weapons (but you can't get all of them in one game, which is a disapointment), and lots of replay value. However, the stages are a little too dark, and it may be hard to see on some TVs."
1,Awful,"007 Nightfire.... When I bought Nightfire I thought WOW! this game is going to be a blast! I beat the game on operative the day I got it. I thought to myself okay, minor setback, I'll try 00 agent. Beat it the next day. I think this game deserves a one star. I have to admit, it has good graphics, but the A.I. is laughable, and the game has very low replayability. Get a good game like GOLDENEYE 007 or Halo. Those rock! I mean come on guys, a Mexican guy takes over a space station that has 8 nukes! What? Why does Bond go? Just blast the stupid thing. Another thing, the MP5K is only in burst! It is supposed to be full auto. When you shoot the bad guys its just like shooting concrete. No blood either. Don't buy Nightfire! If anyone agrees with me, email me at Cheeze2go@aol.com"
3,Almost perfect,"Though I haven't beaten Nightfire, I'm close to doing so. This game still has the weapons and the gadgets....Like always! I think that the multiplayer mode in Nigtfire is the best of all 007 games. This game(though it is first person)takes a lot of stealth. In one mission you must rescue civilian hostages. Let the villian see you and boom, he shoots the civilian. MISSION OVER!! The only two reasons I give Nightfire 3 stars is because A:Some missions are way too long, and B:Some missions are WAAAAY too hard. This game is good, but too all of you Gamecube and ps2 owners out there, try007:Agent Under Fire first."
5,007 At It's Best,"Nightfire is one of the greatest Bond games ever.The missions are great going all around the world (and universe).Great graphics and really cool weapons (especially the Ronin).People say it's not the right Bond voice, but who cares?Good multiplayer with all the different types of games but locations are not as good as Agent Under Fire.Smart and clevear villians with a great storyline.Definately one of my favourite games."
4,"Good, but not as good","Nightfire was better than Agent Under Fire in many ways but if you are going to be player multiplayer, agent under fire has much more options that are not avaialable in Nightfire such as low gravity, powerups, quick silencing, snd important technical things."
3,Oh no,"This game is like Enter the matrix it starts off good butthe replay value is bad. It will never be as good or betterthan goldeneye or timesplitters,(1 or 2) the FPsof the game is too slow and strategized and not fast pasedlike other FPS's. The driving is pretty good though i'd give that4stars, but other wise, if you are A bond fan only, and likeany game thats an FPS i reccomend this game to you. otherwiseif your a multiplatform, multi-genre gamer like me, idon't reccoment it to you."
4,brilliant and easy to use,"I find this so easy to use and powerful for all the publishing I have to do, print & Web. Highly recommended!"
3,A bunch of great ideas executed poorly.,"This game is packed with innovative ideas, but none of them are executed well. Metal Gear Solid fans will be happy to know that Solid Snake is a playable character from the start, and the Tony Hawk-based control scheme is easy to learn. From there, everything else is hell. Boss battles are stupid and repetitve, and control of your skater is bad. Objectives are nothing new, along with many of the park designs. Creating a trick sounds good, but what fun is it if you can never pull off the trick? It is not completely bad, as tricks are fun, especially because you can catch some big air. But when games like TONY HAWK 4 are on the market, why should you bother with this?"
1,Broke on the first time use,I would not recommend purchasing this item. I was in the market for a product I could use where I live. I live in a complex and don't have the option of parking my vehicle near my home so I can use the outlets inside for a vacuum. So when I came across this product I thought I had solved this problem at last. The first time I go to use it the plug broke into several pieces. The vacuum was useless at that point and I couldn't finish cleaning the car till I went and paid to use the vacuum at the service station. Waste of money if you purchase this item.
5,An essential resource for every parent of a premature baby.,"Your Premature Baby and Child by Amy Tracy and Dianne Maroney provides support and valuable information for one of the most difficult tasks of raising a child born prematurely - the transition home from the hospital. This book is an essential resource for every parent of a premature baby - it continues the story of caring for your premature baby from the point where other books stop. Although the intensity of experience lessons after leaving the hospital, parents find themselves in a new world in providing for a baby with special needs. Now the parents are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the health and well being of their child - it is an immense and sometimes frightening responsibility, requiring parents to assume many new roles. The excellent selection of quotes from parents bring a level of emotional depth and experience to the Your Premature Baby and Child both valuable and affirming to parents going down the same road."
4,Fuccons Pt. 0 is a good buy,"I picked this up for like $5 somewhere, maybe less. There are a number of very short episodes that I find very funny. It's ridiculous and definately not funny to the average American. But the surreality and the simplicity of the humor is great and fresh. Recommended if you find Aqua Teens or anything like that funny"
4,"Inexpensive, but not cheap.","It has a short lip on the front and back to keep items from slipping off. It's nice and strong, should be able to handle 50lbs no problem. Measurements are perfect for a 19'' network 2 post rack. Aside from the box it came in, the shelf is in perfect condition and without any warping.I took a star off for the mediocre packaging and lack of mounting hardware. You get a beat up box and the shelf, no more, no less.I have purchased many $100+ shelf's for clients and I still bought this for myself... I can't see why it should ever cost more, well maybe if your stacking gold bars, but then you can afford a fancy alloy shelf!"
4,Odyssey ARS2 2 Space Rack Shelf Accessory,"We needed shelving for our church's new mixer cart, but were stunned by the high prices. The Odyssey ARS2 2 Space Rack Shelf was a pleasant surprise at a great price. It seemed a bit flimsy at frost, but once mounted in our cart, it's just fine. And the price can't be beat. We looked."
5,Great FIRST book into Programming!,"I really enjoyed this book. The ""personality"" of the book is far more enjoyable to read than most other programming books. If you are having trouble with terminology or missed a day in Computer Science 101, than this is the book for you.The fact this book uses Ruby as it's main programming language is secondary, and learning what simple statements mean is obviously the point of the book.If you are an experienced programmer, you'll fine this book highly annoying.I'd HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone curious about programming. This is a gentle step into the pool."
3,Medical Western,"Al Lacy combines a western genre with medical detail weaving an mildly interesting tale. The characters and plot are very tidy. There is suspense but as the story unfolds it is obvious that hardly any harm will come to anyone in the story.I appreciate the use of scripture, sometimes less is more but at times it felt like a sermon rather than a fictional story.I am certain Mr. Lacy has many fans and if you want a comfortable read then this book will meet that need.Though not a medical professional I did query one statement regarding a nursing mother passing along the pain medicine to her child. I know personally, that in the 1960's this was not a medical belief so I wonder at it happening in the time period of this novel.For those who like western novels it is encouraging that Mr Lacy's works are available."
2,Once this was pure evil!,"When I was young, Motorhead was the hardest thing around. Then came Venom! I bought ""Black metal"" on LP and in fact I liked a couple of tracks. Now (long after I sold all my LP's) I saw this album released on CD, and I decided buy it again, for old time sake...I must say that the metal genre surely has developed, or at least gone further we could imagine back in 1982. By today's standard Venom are no longer the heaviest or meanest guys... With hindsight we can clearly see that Venom weren't even that talented in the first place but the title track ""Black metal"" sure have something special.I guess you can buy this album for nostalgic reasons but if you're unfamiliar with Venom I guess you'll find it all rather ridiculous. The production isn't good, but for me who haven't heard this album in almost 15 years it was quite a pleasant experience. Maybe another 15 years will pass before I put this one again."
3,I must be missing something,"I just don't like it. I bought this because it was highly rated and because many who bought other albums I love bought this also. I was tempted to give it 2 stars, but I'm hoping a few more plays will bring it up a notch. But I know it will never be one of my better cd's."
1,Adobe InDesign 2.0,"Apparently I wasn't the only one who took a beating on this software. After many attempts to install InDesign it took DAYS to figure out how to open the Program. At every turn the only help available would cost more money. The final straw was ADOBE charging $39.00 PER QUESTION!After finally getting the Program to work, it turned out to be very parochial.SAVE YOUR MONEY/SAVE YOUR SANITY!Stay clear of ADOBE."
2,Makes sustainable gardening seem harder than it is....,"The book says ""it presents the basic principles of gardening in easy-to-understand terms accessible to even a beginning backyard gardener"". I found it a difficult read even for an experienced gardener like myself. While there is some good tibidts of information here and there, its nothing you can't find in other, more reader friendly books."
4,Great Comedy,if you like What about Bob and Groundhog day then you'll like this film to. This is a tab bit more intellegent but still funny.
5,Caustically funny movie,"Reminds me of the initial Out of Towners for its feeling of being trapped in a city with everything going wrong, but has a little more bite. I'm curious if anyone else noticed a Philadelphia connection. Two things I picked up (and there may be more). The guy getting off the subway with a Phillies hat at the beginning of the movie and the box of Ronzoni spaghetti at the convenience store when Grimm is trying to get change. Coincidence?"
2,a little disappointing,"I don't know if it's because I bought this movie with expectations too great for a comedy released in early 90's. Or because I saw it after having seen all other great masterpieces of Bill Murray including Groundhog Day, What About Bob and The Man Who Knew Too Little. But this one was a little disappoining. In contrast to most the reviews you'll see here, I'll say it wasn't funny. The plot was way too predictable. There is however an element of suspence, which I guess I did not expect of a comedy. So, in a word, a great movie anyway for die-hard fans of Bill Murray. Yes, it should be noted he is still the good ole Bill Murray you'll see in any good comedy. Hope you enjoy it and can beat my impression."
4,Classic Bill Murray!,"Groundhog is my favorite but this one is good. Note: I also like ""The man who knew to little"" so I am weird"
2,small,The quality of the plasitc was good but some of the students complained that the size was difficult to use.
3,It looks pretty good.,I'm not a big fan of golfing games but EA always makes good sports games so I'm confident this one would be a pretty good title.
4,Awesome Read,"This was an absolutely wonderful follow up to Dawnthief. It's filled with plenty of fast paced, steel flying, blood spewing, magic slinging battles to keep the pages turning.I wanted to give this book five stars, but I could only give it four. While The Raven are the central point in the story, I found the other characters and their situations much more interesting: The Barrons Greese and Blackthorne; Stillian and the Protectors; General Darrick; and the Wesman Army. Don't get me wrong, I love the Raven mercenaries. It's a great story line, but they just seemed to take a back seat on this one for me.But all in all, it was a damn good read. Two thumbs up!"
4,Fascinating Stories,"If you are interested in Apache history told from an Apache perspective, this is a wonderful collection of stories and photos. Nearly all of Native American history is told by white people from their perspective. Eve Ball, though a white woman, recorded these stories in the first person voices of Apache's she knew and it seemed without romanticizing or passing judgement. I found every chronical compelling and enlightening especially because the history is not so distant living here in the West where the ancestors of the Mescalero Apache and other bands remain."
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought two of these frames for 2 sets of parents. I was surprised at the button response on the unit--it was lousy (the remote works better for controlling menus). I think the biggest disappointment is that this is a product to display photos and smack in the left quadrant of the display is a digital clock stamp. Why? and why can't it be turned off? When I looked at the box for this product, the promotional photo frames display no clock--If I had known that the clock was there and could not be turned off I would have bought something else. Maybe this is picky, but remember getting snapshots with a date stamp on them? cheesy! I expected more of a $200 product."
4,Strong sword and sorcery throwback.,Yes it was written at least 25 years ago but if your looking for one of the lost gems of the 70s this is it. Early Moorcock type of story in the best way. Prince Kavin leads the remnants of his people away from a struggle against strange invaders hoping to find peace. I dont know much about this underated author other than he was less than prolific.
2,Terrible...not worth the money,"I usually don't write reviews, and I try to keep things on the positive side, but I felt it was my duty to warn other consumers about this video game. I read the review previous to mine and thought I'd take a chance since it had received such a high rating. The screen shots on the package made it look like Grand Theft Auto (which I really like). But much to my dismay, the graphics were bad, the sound was bad, and the gameplay was subpar...not exciting at all. You don't have to take my word for it, though. Buy it yourself and maybe you'll agree that this is one of the weakest games I've seen produced for the GameBoy Advance. Luckily, I was able to return it and get my money back."
3,Uhhh...it arrived with a broken dispenser... yech,"Soo good product, but someone needs to test the dispensers which arrived broken or just not working. Very poor, that, but the product is great. So I use a q tip to get the lotion out of the bottle, or shake it like ketchup. I really tried everything to get the dispenser to work. This lotion is much too expensive for the dispenser not to work."
5,Dracula for Vampire the Requiem,"Just purchased and read this and I am very glad to add this book to my vampire the requiem collection. It does an excellent job of incorporating the Dracula mythology into the vampire the requiem mythos. Great companion piece to the fiction book Rites of the Dragon, also for Vampire the Requeim game.Along with Circle of the Crone and Invictus this is a great covenant book.For anyone who wants to play an Ordo Dracul vampire or for any storyteller who wants a deeper understanding of the goals and motivations of this enigmatic vampire coven, this book is indispensible."
5,Yum!,This product is the perfect thing for post-maternity bellies. It smells fabulous and it's a nice treat at the end of a long day. I highly recommend this product!
4,The Final Golden Ancerls,"Those familiar with my reviews on Amazon will know of my love for Supraphon's ""Gold Edition"" Karel Ancerl CDs. Well I recently picked up the final six volumes in this collection (vols 37-42) and I have to say they are as delightful as the first 36 sets. Volume 40 features Ancerl and the Czech PO performing Jarmil Burghauser's ""Seven Reliefs for Large Orchestra"" and Vaclav Dobias' 2nd Symphony, in stereo recordings from 1964 and 1960 respectively. Ancerl was best known for the music of his native country and for showcasing the works of 20th Century composers, so it is only natural that he championed the modern Czech music presented here. Both pieces prove a challenging listen, but they are thoroughly enjoyable. In all, this title is part of a fitting to conclusion to a great series and a great conductor."
2,Not even the manual,"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought it after reading a few reviews and recommendations from NAPP. It seems to me it isn't any much more than the manual revisited with a few extra details. I was hoping for some innovation and some interesting things that I might have stirred into my pot of knowledge, but I found I was reading a lot on basic tool function. It's a manual at best. It is too text bookie, and too long and drawn out over simple things. I got to about the 18th chapter, and put it down. I don't think there is anything that I'd use. I feel sorry that the message is so down as the things that I've read are accurate in the book. I just don't feel the investment came out to be worth it very well."
2,not what I expected,"The material used to make this bag is leather look alike plastic, not at all what I had in mind when I bought this bag. I do not think it is worth what I paid and would return it in a heart beat."
3,Not bad for just fashion,"Although the size of it is not as big as I wish, it's actually not bad for a everyday go around town bag. With its different way of carrying it, it's fun to have and just mix and match with different outfit. Not bad!"
1,Not at all expected..,"I will keep this short and sweet, horrible quality! The Material is horrific. The ""decoration"" of the studs, i would expect to see them fall off after about a month or so. Maybe a nice bag for the young, but worth $80... not a chance!!"
5,Find This Ultra-Rare 'Deep Soul' Collection...,"...Volumes One, Two and Three! You will be thoroughly pleased.Of this volume, the sequence is very nice starting with the one two three punch of ""Love on a Two Way Street"" and ""Didn't I Blow Your Mind"" and ""Whatcha see is Whatcha Get"". The crown jewels in this volume are those rare cuts ""That's the Way It's Got to Be: Body and Soul"" and ""One Monkey Don't Stop No Show"". But take it from me, it is a very good collection."
2,Not up to Standard,This book was well below the expectations I had formed based on reading the Liaden Universe series. The action and events seemed contrived and poorly woven. Charecters were not well developed or engaging. There were whole paragraphs that just seemed to be repeated more than once. I would not care to read the future books in this series.
4,you will fall in love with spiders!,"I liked the characters in this book better than the liaden crew, more human, less caught up in a certain mind set. Certainly more action, and you will fall in love with #11 and # 15.This is what a good story should be, action, passion, and dreaming of the stars. Bravo to the authors, and a good read should not be missed. Theresa may"
4,Brand New Lee & Miller Storyline,"A sci-fi twist on the 'Thief with a heart of gold' story. Gem ser Edreth views himself more as an artist than an outlaw, and tries to conduct himself as if he has no heart at all. He chooses his targets as much for the challenge they present as for their monetary value, working only with a small army of mechanical spiders and holding himself aloof from all emotional entanglements.This attitude crumbles when his cousin shows up out of the blue, quoting prophesy and trying to recruit him back into the family that sold him into slavery as a child.As always, Sharon Lee and Steve Miller's characters are the best part of the story. Every character, no matter how brief their appearance, is immediately *real* and you want to know more about them. Even the cyberspiders, who have numbers rather than names, seem to take on distinct personalities.The novel is complete unto itself, no major cliffhangers at the end, but can obviously continue on as a series."
4,"Darker, but it still sparkles....","Al Stewart has always had a darker side, but it dominates much of this album. Still, the songs and the style show us the world of 1971 as seen thru the eyes of an electric folk-rock musician. In this release, Al is looking inward, which isn't unusual -- but the results are excellent poetry, and musically, very satisfing. The release of ""Orange"" and ""To Whom It May Concern"" fills in the background albums for Al, and sets the stage for his breakthru albums ""Past, Present And Future"" (for the English crowd) and ""Year of the Cat"" (in America.)"
4,oldskool classic,this is classic matches u get lou thesz vs antonio rocca twice and killer kowaski and gorgous george i mean the real one not the girl this dvd is 2 hrs i believe some matches are clipped a little not that much u cant really tell i dont know if they are but still good way to relieve the matches over all id buy it for cheap price and good way to learn old school dvd is in black and white froms 60s 50ssincerlyLDL
1,Ugly movie,"It is the worst horror movie I have ever seen, no scary, poor acting, not really comedy, dreadful effects hilarious, I mean it is just bad, you just lose your time wathching that, you dont feel anything it is a bad and a poor movie."
4,Power and deceit vs. poverty and integrity,"When attorney Angelica refuses to accept the assignment of her big New York City firm, she is fired. Not only fired, but blackballed in the entire area. Dejected and yet feeling so right about her decision, she moves back to her California home. Her wealthy parents are mortified that she would trade such an important job for the simplistic and ridiculous job of public defender for illegals and the poor. Antonio, an illiterate Mexican young man, comes to work at their horse ranch just as she arrives home, and she decides to make a difference in his life.This opening book lays the foundation for a very possible, though highly unlikely love story of the decade. Readers will hate the crooked ranch foreman, love Poppy, and wonder just what makes the Amantes tick.There is so much intrigue, so much feeling, so much love and hate in this story, I am recommending this series of 3 to all my Christian fiction reader friends."
5,"An eye opening, heart warming tale","This book is a page turner! I did not want to put it down. It is a tale of sacrificing your career for what is noble and finding the love that God has hand picked. It is truly heart warming and thought provoking.Angelica was an up and coming attorney. She worked for a prestigious law firm in New York. She realizes that her firm is taking advantage of the less fortunate. As they are about to offer her a promotion she is left with a life altering decision. Should she do what is right or further her career?Soon she meets Antonio who works on her parents' ranch in California. Antonio is handsome, hardworking and self sacrificing. He is the oldest child in his family. He left their poverty stricken home in Mexico to provide for his family.When these two lives collide it is a magical story."
1,You guys are lamers,"How can you guys know how the game looks or plays? That one guy said he got it a month early cause his dad works at Nintendo, thats a buch of bull! None of you no what the GBA version looks like. It was discontinued. You can't get a game that never came out, even if your dad does work at Nintendo. The PS2 version rocks, but as far as I can tell, you plp need to go outside more often. You're starting to think your playing a game that never exsisted!"
1,It would be better for PC or Mac,This is not a consle type game its a computer type game the makers messed up big time Youll see if or when you buy it
3,A well-acted family movie.,"In this movie (very similar, in atmosphere and personality, to GRIZZLY ADAMS), two modern-day Oregon children are transported back to 1870 via a cave while on a camping trip. There, they help a mountain man named Jeremiah save the mountain from a greedy businessman and his cohorts. The children are compelled to help Jeremiah, because if the mountain is destroyed, so is their hope of returning to the 1990s. The character of Jeremiah is very much like Grizzly Adams: likable and well able to take care of himself in the mountains. The children are well able to handle themselves, and in their efforts to do so, they sometimes try Jeremiah's patience. All in all, it's a good movie. In a way, it's a politically correct movie: the theme is that it's wrong to develop mountains or any other wild areas for business purposes. Political correctness aside, I give this movie a thumbs-up for family quality. And but for one swear word, used once, I would rate it G."
4,Good family entertainment...,"This movie would definitely not be recommended for any academy awards--and that's why I give it only 4 stars. But, this is good family entertainment, especially if you have young kids. It's a kind of adventure that children fantasize about. Even though the acting wasn't top notch, the story was fun, and I believe it is a good movie to watch if you have elementary school age children. There's a decent message in good old fashioned childrens adventure story."
1,unavailable product for sale,I'd still like to have the product. What's pictured is not what was sent - twice. Received half sized brush with handle. Vendor finally gave up. One star is too many.
3,"better for kids, but with this price... maybe others too","First of all, for this price, it's hard to make too many complaints. I just wanted to note for anyone who may not realize this that the poster is fairly simple... as I suppose you could expect when you try to fit all the body systems in one poster. Most of the information on here I learned when I was in middle school, although a lot of us could probably use a brush up on some of this stuff! The poster is probably best, however, for kids/older kids under the age of 14."
4,versatile but not durable,"this sun glasses are very good,they can adjust in every way but the plastic behind the ears is very fragile."
5,Outstanding examples of flower photography,Both domestic and nature flowers are covered. The flower photos are totally outstanding and worth the price alone. It should inspire anyone to shoot great flower photos.
5,Great for multiple pets,"This is convenient for watering our cats, however they don't go through the quantity of water fast enough to keep it from getting yucky. It's not easy to move (without spilling) so I like to wait until it's empty before I move it. With two cats, that takes a good week to 10 days. By then, it's getting yucky. I've started filling it with less water, but if you've got more pets and like to keep it clean for them, this will be just great."
2,GOod,"I like this product because you can clean inside the actual bottled water area. It is hard to get all of the ""clicks"" onto the bottle when you add more water to it. Overall, pleased."
2,Difficult to snap lid on tightly,I found it difficult to snap lid on water resevoir. You have to be very careful when filpping over in case it spills out.
2,Campy and overkilled,"The series was tired, worn out and campiness was evident in thismontonous two-parter about a cult leader hijacking a governmentrocket (yawn). Solo and Kuryakin are ready to retire. Solojoining the cult in a transparent disguise is a laugh! TheAxel Brothers are a take on the Marx Brothers."
2,Almost the best novel ever,"I eagely awaited the release of this book and read it as soon as it was published in its English version a few years ago. I agree with other commentators on this page who praise the ""ingenious social commentary"" and so forth. Indeed, right up to page 98 I felt that this book had the makings of one of the best novels ever.However, after page 98 the magic abruptly disintegrates. I don't know how else to put it. It's a shame. Googling for details of Tatyana's life, you get some clue as to why she could not sustain the magic."
2,Mediocre Russian Dystopian Novel,"I'll surely grant that Tatyana Tolstoya is a fine writer and excellent stylist. However, I did not find her dystopic view of a Russian future all that compelling. Margaret Atwood has covered much of the same terrain in several novels, most notably her splendid ""The Handmaid's Tale"" with a gripping plot and memorable characters. Unfortunately I found none of Tolstaya's characters of interest, with the possible exception of Benedikt. Anyone interested in reading great dystopian novels should turn to Orwell and Atwood first, before reading this slender tome."
2,Overrated,"Slow to start the plot, this novel is occasionally confusing, and probably 100 pages too long. The post apocalyptic tableau is misleading; this is an overwrought Russian fable. It's best classified in the post-modernist, semi-fabulist genre. I suspect some of its appeal was lost in translation, but I also suspect the Translator may have saved the book by her superb rendering of Russian colloquialisms into English. The ending is a disappointment.There are some redeeming qualities. Several laugh out loud moments of Russian humor and irony. I liked the novel plot device of ""Olden-Timers"" who survived ""The Blast"", were mutated and apparently immortalized. The descriptions of ""golubchiks"" muddling through winter hardship were simultaneously comical and horrendous.Other NYRB books I have read have been outstanding. This book was mediocre."
5,The review from Publishers Weekly is misleading,"The review from Publishers Weekly is wrong saying that the world described in The Slynx is the world of permanent winter. The reviewer obviously have not read the book.The book is a masterpiece of Russian language. I suppose it is equally hard to translate to English as to translate Shakespeare from English. Tolstaya's language is not a simple Russian, it is a colorful, rich literature language. Note that the book is written as if on behalf of Benedikt. And Tolstaya in a masterly fashion gives the prose a rural and still noble shade of Russia primordial. It's really enjoying."
3,..when the bristles began falling out,When the bristles began falling out I realized that this product was not as expected. Let the buyers beware.
1,Millennium Boredom,An extremely poor movie from TaiwanThere is no shortage of cigarettes there.All bar scenes are extremely inept.
4,Good for video and sports,"The cam is vey good as a sports camcorder, resistant, small, a perfect zoom also. The1 Gb memory can help in order to keep your files and see different things as you wish.Things I didn't like, the photo resolution and siye is not good, it looks gross and there is no way to fix the quality of photos, only works for the videos. Also, the video file type is complicated for some programs and the codec is not easily downloaded, in cases it just doesn' t work and will only give you sound."
2,Not for the family user,"This unit, while extremely compact, was not meant for the family user.Video in lower light conditions is unacceptable, and photos takenwith the built-in flash unit usually are very dark if more than6 feet away.This unit is for the outdoor sports enthusiast, but not for thefamily or indoor user."
2,1 Star as a Camcorder & 5 stars as a premium Webcam,"This product has a VERY specific and narrow purpose. For what it is actually designed for, it's one of the best you can buy.I'm really disappointed with Samsung and how they have taken a premium webcam and tried to ""market hype"" or sell it as a digital camcorder. This product is as much of a camcorder as most digital still cameras are in movie mode.If you want a top end web camera that is detachable, can double as a lightly capable camcorder, need to take helmet action movies. This is your product.One outstanding feature is the ability to plug in an external NTSC camera of any type and record."
1,P(ri) Madona - get you facts straight and grow up!,"The downloadable spec sheet for this camera from Samsung's US web site states clearly that it is suposedly Mac OSX compatible under the section titled 'Conectivity', on last page of pdf - so much for the childish comments in prior reviews. Obviously from all the relevant reviewers comments it is anything but compatible with OSX and coupled with no image stablization for the external lens makes it fairly useless for it's intended purpose i.e. sports. Classic case of lame marketing and very disappointing from a company such as Samsung."
3,"Tiny, unreadable print","Absolutely georgeous photography and Lovatt-Smith has obviously hiked all across Morocco searching for homes. I was most impressed with the variety of homes, especially the cave homes.I'm sure there is a great deal of useful information in this book, but I gave it three stars because the print was tiny and itallicized. In places where it was superimpossed over sand, water or some other scenery, it was unreadable. Why didn't an editor catch that?"
2,"AN OK BOOK, NOT INSPIRING, THE ENGLISH PRINT IS TEENY TINY","Morocco is beautiful and full of color, thats what I was expecting and hoping for, the book is kind of okish, many pages having drawings, like a kid from school did it, the rest of the photos, have mainly brown tones to them, a good portion of the pages have no photos, but some info and the picture on the opposit page, and there are prints in three languages, even the the front cover of the book is in large english, the english portion in the book is teeny tiny, I must struggle to read it, or get a magnifier, or better yet to make it simple, dont even read it, just browse through looking at the photos, which arent all that or inspriing, basicly I found the book to be more of a huge let down more than any thing else, no I would not reccomend this book, something you might check out from a library, but in no means to actually buy, and pay money for"
4,Lovely book,"This is the book to buy if you want to experience the color an style Of Moroccan houses.If you look for ideas for your interior ,and you like warm colors ,this book is the one to choose."
3,Meh.,"I bought this as a gift for someone. After purchasing, I realised it wasn't quite right. This particular flag is missing the red, diagonal cross, and was the national flag of GB during 1606 - 1801. I returned the item and am still waiting for the refund."
1,Just plain wrong,This is not the current British Union Jack as adopted around 1801. It does have some resemblance to the old Union Jack which was abandoned in 1801 by both England and Scotland - when they were known as the Kingdom of Britain; even then it is a bad copy as the white stripes (Cross of St. Andrew) are much thicker - not to mention it is completely missing the cross of St. Patrick!
2,DON'T BUY WITHOUT HAVING ACCESSORIES,"OUCH! I PAID MORE FOR BATTERY CHARGER, DISCS, CABLES, CASE THEN THE CAMCORDER COST.MY ERROR-CAMCORDER TECHNICALLY OBSOLETE. LOW END PRODUCT."
1,Dont Buy This camera,"Good for shooting but not editing or transferring movies to other dvds. Dont buy this product, sony is garbage."
1,Don't buy this camera,"This camera was okay for about a year, but with very little use and absolutely no abuse, it broke down. Similar problem to what others are reporting here - it records, but on playback it says ""disk error"" etc. Sony wants $229 to fix it. No thanks!"
2,editing issues,"this camera is cool, but it is very difficult to take the mini dvd and copy the files onto my computer to use in an editing program. i think this camera is a waste of money, editing movies is what makes them look good, especially if you're shooting surfing or any other sport."
5,It's worked,"What ever brand is it, as long as it works that is count. This Opteka grip works perfectly and I paid for much much less."
4,Movie review,The movie was a little different than I expected. It would be great for a group session on despondancy or depression.
2,Pretty redundant 2 cd set,"The tracks on cd 1 are1. People of the Sun2. Zapata's Blood (live)3. Without a Face (live)The tracks on cd 2 are1. People of the Sun2. Killing in the Name3. Bullet in the HeadThe only song worth getting off these cd's is Without a Face. Zapata's Blood can be found on the Vietnow single and has the Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos intro too. CD 2 is pointless, seems like a money grabber as all tracks are studio versions. So overall not great value and only for the completist."
5,W0nderful stuff,[Recordings 1927-1933Over the years I have owned about half of the tracks on these 5 C.Ds on old vynl L.Ps.These are now to worn to play.It was a joy to hear them again so fresh and clear with their digital remastering.I regard tracks not previously owned as a pure bonus and the 5 C.D. package as superb value for money.
2,The brush cannot reach the bottom of the bottle,"The brush cannot reach the bottom of the bottle and it is too hard, creates not good touch the wall of the bottle at all. i tried several different bottles, it didn't work very well."
2,Only works if you are really fast or very distracted,"Good idea, not great performance. You have to be a really quick candy-opener to make it work. Fun idea anyway..."
2,Why use a model for the exercises?,"I started collecting books on facial exercises when my face began looking tired all the time. This was the only book I could find at the book store--it looked good, but that's about it. Since then, I've purchased the Facercise book I found on amazon.com, then the Facercise video. My face looks like it did 10 years ago."
3,Hypnosis or NLP,"I don't know if I'm outdated or what, but the books coming out now are more of NLP advertising than good old hypnosis. I found this book to be the same. Alot of information about other techniques rather than hypnosis. The hypnosis stuff is there but limited.Mary make it look so easy, sit the client down, start talking and bang, the client is in trance. It can't be that easy, or is it. (Maybe it's the way Mary watered down her writing of the sessions). Looking at the bibliography it looks to me that only 4 books were of about hypnosis the rest is of NLP or phychology. This NLP stuff has some kind of hold on so called want to be hypnotherapist.(NLP practinioners should not use Hypnotherapy as a title, get your own)What I did like about the book was the Mary layed out what therapy she used for each case. The information provided about starting a practice is all very basic, the page and half proves it."
3,3 Stars at best,"It is an ok performance and a technically acceptable recording, but this is the ABB at their lowest. The line-up is the weakest they have put together, and compared to other line-ups/performances I have seen, just seem to be going through the motions. Hopefully, there will be other concerts with better line-ups that will be released, PLEASE."
1,"The ""Little"" engine that couldn't","Let me begin by stating that I have enjoyed the first four Bentley Little books that I read (""The Store"", ""The Association"", ""The Return"" & ""The Summoning"") but have found the last two (""The Town"" and ""The Burning"") just impossible to get through. Since this review is about ""The Burning"", let me focus on it.I found the novel to be too draggy almost from the start. Little attempts to tie together 4 disparate characters from across the country to the appearance of a ghostly train that begins to appear to them (and some others) as the book plods along. The characters were not likeable, nor did I really give a rat's patoot about their problems. Not unlike the engine, the book just takes too long to gather up any steam for this reviewer (a firm believer in ""too many books, not enough time"", by the way).Little throws around a few shocks and more than a little gratuitous sexual scenes, but not enough to keep me around for more than 180 pages of this clunker."
3,NOT SO HOT...,"Although the author is one of the most imaginative writers in the horror fiction genre, this book is not one of his best. The story finds four of its main characters encountering mysterious and frightening situations in their lives, situations that are simply surreal. All of their encounters are in different parts of the country, and the characters are all from totally different backgrounds. Yet, the horror that is intruding on each of their lives has a commonality: a ghost train. It seems that a curse from the past is now intruding upon their present.Unfortunately, the concept of a malevolent ghost train barreling across the country out of nowhere simply did not capture my imagination. While portions of the book are genuinely creepy, the story never fully engaged me, and towards the end the book was almost a chore to finish. Still, fans of the author may get some enjoyment out of it."
2,Not his best.....,"I've read all of Bentley Little's books and I was excited to get my hands on his new one. Sadly the book was only medicore. For me Little's books are in two catergories, first the ones I think are really good, interesting and well written (The Store, Dispatch, Dominion, The Association) and second the ones that are so-so (University, The House, The Resort). I guess I would have to file The Burning in the second category. Don't get me wrong Little is a good writer I just found that this book took too long to get going and that the several story lines of different characters didn't fuse well together. However I still find Little's work more often than not worth reading and I will still buy his new books when they come out."
1,Electric Luminarias,"The luminarias were not what I expected and I returned them. They are not hard plastic, but simply a thick plastic bag. The method of attaching them to the electric cord is complicated and it would take a lot of time to install them. Also, the anchors to tie down the cords are not included and would have to be purchased elsewhere.This experience was expensive because I had to pay postage both ways plus a $5.00 restocking fee. It was also a big hassle."
4,well worth the $0 price tag,"The book was well worth the read, some aspects of the book are opinionated and have since been proven inacurate, but given the information available to Wood at the time, he has still managed to craft a quality naritive. A solid 4 star read."
2,"Random Acts of Kindness,,,,(English version)","I was given the Original ""Random Acts of Kindness"" book as a birthday present. I loved it, and quoted from it. It was so well liked by me, that it was stollen from my house! I ordered the same book, I thought, and received this English version in the mail, and was terribly disappointed. Not only have I lost the orginal book, but the new one is filled with English ""jargon"", which I can accept, but the style of humor is not our style of humor in the USA. I was very disappointed, that I did not receive the Original version of ""Random Acts of Kindness"" in the mail from you!"
5,Very nice holster,This is a very comfortable holster. I was pleasantly impressed with it. The paddle is not too large like some I've seen.
1,Not what it appears to be.,"This adaption will no work with a Nokia E71 Phone.The adapter that I received has a different appearance from the photo.When I plunged this adapter and headset into my Nokia E71.The phone reports ""Accessory not Supported"".I wish Nokia would follow the established standards for which they signed onto as a supporting member.I bought this adapter hoping that I could use my real nice Plantroics headset on this phone but no luck."
3,The highliter is the best part,"The ""Red Stiletto"" was not as brick-y brown as I was expecting, but the gold and silver highliter were pleasant surprises. I love layering one or the other over a darker lipstick to warm it up or cool it down. I'd definitely be willing to try this brand in another color, maybe something brownish."
1,JÁNOS/JOHN HUNYADI WAS A MAGYAR/HUNGARIAN!,"János Hunyadi was a Hungarian, not a Romanian! He lived in Erdély (the so-called ""Transylvania"") that was part of Hungary/Magyarország until the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 (dismemberment of Hungary). As a result of this treaty, Hungary lost an unprecedented 2/3 of her territory, and 1/3 of her population!"
5,Farberware 2 pcs classic skillet with lid,"This skillet is quite large and excellent quality materials. The skillet is larger than I expected to be of practical use as it is humongous! One should view this skillet in person before purchasing because it dwarfs the size of the largest burner and will rarely get any use. Consider a 11"" skillet as the largest suitable skillet for practical use, even for a family of 8 or 10 people. I will still keep my new 12"" skillet because I like the lid which fits fine over my 11"" skillet that did not come with a cover. I believe it is a Mirro brand. I would NOT recommend this skillet because it is just TOO BIG to be of practical use for even the largest of families. Just being honest, so please look at this skillet before buying or it will just be sitting on your shelf."
2,The Lather Effect is a waste,"Sorry to bare bad news, but this movie was 95 minutes of pure pain. I could have watched it and it was great, however that would be a lie.It is being called ""The Big Chill"" for the 80's group that is true. I neverliked that movie either.It has a R rating that was well deserved. I can't recommand this movie unless you are a cult follower of lather, rise and repeat or one of the actors.Hope this helps."
3,Fun with some plot issues,"A very light hearted 30-something drama that feels a bit like you just walked into these people lives.Well acted, funny but I found a certain plot point unrealistic that no one had figured it out over 20 years. It was also confusing as to who's house they were in until closer to half way through the film which I felt was a missed oportunity for more humor.Eric Stolz cracked me up and I did for the most part find the characters believeable but for that one big plot mistake I think this would have been a 4 star film.Enjoyable and worth watching, the soundtrack is also fun."
2,Thank goodness for Eric Stoltz and the pink dress,"I love the Big Chill and was very excited to see an updated version. The Lather Effect is the story of a group of thirty-somethings, who were best friends in high school getting together for a reunion party. I have to admit that I was put off right from the start when I saw how trashed the house was. I don't know many people in their thirties that would trash their houses like that. It has a great cast but I found that for the most part we never learned enough about the characters.By the end we knew and cared more but it came so late in the movie that it was a disappointment. I did love the music. Eric Stoltz's character was the most interesting one and I loved Katrina's pink dress :-).Fine if you're looking for a lightly entertaining movie."
3,2 Out of 3 Ain't Bad,"I own all 3 of these items. The Grip n Flip won't hold onto hardly anything, it's way too flimsy. The Scoop n Strain is one of the best kitchens products I own, I wish I had 3 or 4 of them!!! The Six in One Utensil is ok, grips better than the grip n flip and works great as a whisk too. I wish I could just purchase the items seperately!!"
1,Mensa Sudoku by Michael Rios,"I'm very disappointed in the level of difficulty of these puzzles, and feel I've been duped. I was looking for a long book of difficult/extreme puzzles to work on solving techniques, and these were easy/medium. I have the feeling an error was made and medium puzzles were placed in the book instead of Mensa difficulty, and it's a wonder no one caught the error before publication. The books were printed, and still put on the shelf for unsuspecting customers, and I'm annoyed."
3,AD-3201 bug:,"I bought the Apex 3201 and I found this bug: I turned on the player and inserted a VCD. It played fine. I stopped and ejected the DVD tray without remove the CD or turned the power off; I loaded the DVD tray again and it would not play correctly. There was no sound and the picture skipped. I tried other VCDs and the same thing happened. I don't think it is the disc, because it played fine if I turn off the player and turn it back on again. This bug can be repeated everytime."
1,Great Player.... one year later,"No, I don't mean to say that the player has been been great for a year. In fact, it's taken a year and three returns to get this player to play correctly.1. When it arrived new it didn't recognize there was a DVD in it2. After it came back from repair it recognized but wouldn't play a DVD3. After it came back again it played the DVD but froze and/or the screen went blank.4. After it came back again it seems to be playing beautifully.Glad I had an old backup Toshiba in the meantime."
1,smells fishy,"I purchased this DVD player as a gift for my fiance last Christmas and it has been nothing but trouble. About 3 months after I purchased it, it started skipping and pausing on brand new DVDs. One day I was watching a movie and a loud popping noise came from the player. I went in for a closer look, opened the door and was greeted by an unpleasant fishy smell. The player has popped a few times since, still smells like fish, skips, pauses, and has red lines across the display that make it impossible to read. I guess you get what you pay for. I learned my lesson."
2,A whiff of War,"Though I admire the author's courage and vision to write this, in general it was too fragmented for me to enjoy. It reminded me of the lost tablets of Gilgamesh, the story seeming to skip around nonsensically at times. The narrative had Alzheimers and had trouble staying focused. The extended metaphors were silly and insular to the writer. The ending was anti-climatic and tried too hard to be revelatory. However, there are a few brilliant lines and images, but they are fleeting. I hated his interpretation of Diomedes, who I loved in E. V. Rieu's translation of Homer. The whole ""Child"" reference was off key here. I am a huge fan of the Iliad, but this book was very eccentric and seemed to unravel during the second half."
2,Free Information!,"This type of scholarship book is Free for everyone at your local library! The 800 or more pages is mostly a listing of colleges addresses and phone numbers. All high school counselors will have a book similar to this in their office. Its good information to have, but you can get it for free!"
1,Worst Book I have Ever Read!,"So my school had a summer reading list and obviously Olive's Ocean was on the reading list. Well, it was the only one that SEEMED good, so I bought it on Amazon and read it. It was in lovely condition, nice and crisp pages, but the text inside it was the thing that really bugged me. It was so slow and fake. It's like, ""This really didn't happen!"" So I stopped not even 1/10 of the way through it and gave up on it. It REALLY didn't interest me. I tried to give it a chance, but it was so horrible I couldn't. Nothing personal, Kevin Henkes! Oh, and by the way, this is just MY opinion! So, you can go ahead and give it a try...this is just from and avid reader."
3,A Great Book to Read,"This book is great! First it's a girl named Martha Boyle who receives a journal page by a dead girls mother;this girls name was Olive, who admired her and expected Martha to be her friend which Martha never was. But now Martha feels guilty while going to her grandmothers house and Cape Cod. As soon as she gets there she finds a love and a tragedy. Martha also wants to be a writer so while she is in Cape Cod she tries to finish a story about Olive.There's the Mannings ,the Benton place, and the notebook.This will be a exotic book for you!"
2,Not as good as it could have been,"I was very disappointed with Olive's Ocean. I identified little with the main character. I found her to be self-absorbed and self-serving. As I was reading the book, I was constantly hoping for more information regarding Olive. I definitely wanted to know more about her. She seemed to be the most intriguing character in the story and yet the reader discovers little about her. I would love to read a story about Olive. From the little that Mr. Henkes lets us know, the dead girl seemed to have more character and more positive attributes than anyone else in the story."
3,The feeling of incompleteness,"I read the book for a discussion on it; however, it was extremely hard to read. I felt that the characters were not developed nearly as well as they could have been. After reading the book, I felt as some big questions remained unanswered. I felt as if the book was half-way through the story and the author ran out of time and rushed the ending.The contents of the book dealt mostly with the emotions and drama of being an adolescent, which made the book difficult to read for someone that was this age many years ago and lacks children of this age.I feel this book is good for people within the age group but, for people outside of it, hard to relate."
4,A Bittersweet Read,"This is a bittersweet novel with very real characters. I particularly loved Martha's relationship with her grandmother, but I thought all the characters and their relationships were very realistic. There are way too many ""Olives"" in the world and hopefully young readers will respond with more sensitivity to the ""outsiders"" in their own social milieu after reading this book. The book could facilitate some great classroom discussions in several areas and on several levels."
1,i don't understand the positive reviews!,"martha boyle, 12 yrs., has recieved,. as a 'gift', a journal page written by a recently desceased classmate, olive barstow.it hauntingly proclaims martha as 'the nicest person in the whole class'...though they didn't really know each other--the story starts off well enough. the premise is lovely. unfortunately that's about it. i think it an incohesive,unimaginative, unrealistic mess beyond that point.i was painfully distracted with the 'near drowning' by lucy's being buried in the sand precariously close to danger herself,the adolescent interaction is improbable, at best, and olive, as a character, was extremely under developed. i feel let down.this book left me feeling little for and about the characters.i expect more from newberry honor recipients."
2,"""And get my ass killed by some old crazy white woman?!""","Where are the mountains at? This film is called MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE but yet there are no mountains, the ""motel"" appears to be nothing but some shacks in the woods and I had no idea a body count of seven equaled a massacre. But then again MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE is a little more eye-catching than WOODED SHACK INCIDENT.Not the worst slasher movie of all time I give that honor to the agonizing AX'EM, but not the best either more like firmly in the middle or maybe a little higher if you find a frail old woman you could kill with one punch to be scary.For slasher completist or the very bored only, no nudity, little blood, no scares and mediocre filmmaking."
1,doll value research,Extremely disappointed with this book. Unless you are researching special highly collectible dolls this book is not for you. It gvies no ID marks or any other helpful information. Would not recommend this book.
5,16TH BLUE BOOK AND VALUES,"ANOTHER GREAT GUIDE FOR DOLL COLLECTORS.THIS BOOK IS VERY HELPFUL IN PRICING DOLLS TO SELL OR BUYING DOLLS. IT IS THE DOLL BOOK THAT MORE DEALERS USE THAN ANY OTHER AND IS USED AS A GUIDE TO HELP IDENTIFY DOLLS. THE PICTURES ARE GREAT, WISH THERE WERE MORE OF THEM..RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"
4,informative,easy to understandeasy to find what you're looking forvery informativehave used many times since received and for see more
5,Razorback review,"I was attracted to this book because I am vietnam vet. I am also an avid hog hunter. When I read this book, I could not put it down. Scott Wilde portrays ranch life and hog hunting in a very realistic way.I was very impressed that this book had no sex or bad language. However, there was some tasteful romance to this story.I look forward to any future books by Scott Wilde."
5,RIPPING!!!,FINALLY THE NEW BEHEMOTH MY FIRST ALBUM BY THEM WAS DEMIGOD AND FROM THEN ON I WAS HOOKED THE GUITAR PLAYING ON THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT AND INFERNO IS A DRUM MACHINE IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS ALBUM I RECCOMEND IT TO ANY BLACK METAL/DEATH METAL FAN YOUR COLLECTION WON'T BE COMPLETE WITHOUT IT BUY IT NOW!!!
4,Wonderful,"This book is very informative and shows you step-by-step how to use the various technologies. The .NET information alone is worth the cost of this book. I am a webmaster and I feel that this book will help me develop better websites. You download the student files from http://www.course.com. The only down side is when I downloaded the student files, not all the chapters are available."
4,almost what I expected,"Pitcher arrived on time and in perfect condition. Only issue I have is that it has a LOT less bubbles in it that what it shown in the pictures online...and a lot less than the other items in the similar set (I have the tall and short glasses and also bought the salad bowl). I still like the item, but I would have liked it more if it had the same consistency of bubbles in the glass as the other products."
5,"The BEST book if you seek illumination, not documentation!","This book was written by two gentlemen with whom I had the good fortune to work at MacUser Magazine (before it was acquired by MacWorld). John Rizzo was Technical Editor at MacUser, and he's easily the most accurate and informed author available for this kind of book. Dan Clark is one of America's most gifted technical illustrators; his ""see through"" drawings of computers & components always AMAZE other artists and even the most hardcore techies. True to the Mac tradition, this book feels like a looking-glass that lets you float knowlingly through complex electronics, instead of boring you with Windoze-style ""hardware documentation."" A great gift for budding young geeks and undecided potential Mac owners."
1,Rip Off!,"This should not even be classified as a book. It is more like a pamphlet, and it contains old, poorly presented stories and jokes. A VERY weak product, not worth the money I spent getting it. Disappointed that Amazon would carry such shoddy stuff."
3,3 1/2 stars for me,"Nora Roberts writes with ease and confidence. Her prose is always lucid and her plots are credible. Characterization is one of Nora's strengths, with people being revealed rather than described, thereby allowing the reader to engage the text with greater intimacy. This aspect of her writing was recently discussed during an interview with David Letterman on the 'Tonight Show', and at the conclusion of the interview, Letterman's side-kick, Paul Shaffer, screamed out at the top of his voice, 'Hey Nora! I engaged the enemy 20 years ago. Then I married her.' To her credit, Ms Roberts ignored the buffoon's comments and maintained a dignified, Harpo Marx-like silence, concluding the interview with a honk of her bicycle horn. It was a telling moment."
5,Another great book by Roberts!,I find I can't get enough of Nora Roberts! I just finished the Three Sisters Island Trilogy and I loved every page. For anyone new to her books I can recommend her to anyone who likes Judith McNaught or Jude Deveraux. If you already know and love Nora&#65533;s books allow me to suggest Patricia Little&#65533;s first novel &#65533;The Angel&#65533;s Cup&#65533;.
3,"Good Idea, poor execution",I recommend this only to someone who has the patience to correct issues you will have with it. The timing device is not very well built and falls apart after only a few loads. I'm working on a way to replace the timing device with a homemade one that hopefull will be stronger and more consistant.
4,This is a great book for an advanced student,"As the editor suggests, this is not a text for beginning Spanish students. However, as a supplement to a class, it's excellent. Use this when you need a refresher during the summer, or before you delve back in to an intense course.The great thing is that the readings are so diverse! If you don't like one chapter, the next will surely give you another take on vocabulary, grammar, etc. It is not a textbook - it's a reading book.Definitely, it's geared toward older students, avid readers. For younger students who want to be able to write out activities or draw in their text-workbooks, try Flip Flop Spanish."
3,Difficult to understand much of the material,"I was disappointed in the material. These are not Spanish language stories. They are among other things: a Mexican menu, record labels, recipes, poems, descriptions of Spanish movies, etc. I have far from a good understanding of Spanish. One of the poems made very little sense to me. There also some good reading in the book, ie a short story about the Panama Canal for example."
3,"Some Nice Stories, very little advice","I was looking for more of a resource guide when I bought this book, I wanted to learn about things I could eat, drink, or do to be able to breastfeed better ... but it's more like a collection of provoking stories and a brief breast anatomy lesson. Plus lots and lots of encouraging support. I was so excited when I saw an entire book on this topic I just bought it really quick without really researching it's content. The BFAR website is a better resource I feel."
5,douglas adams,"is one of my favorite authors and he has done it again in this book. the ""hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" saga is truly his epic. if you have read the books in the ""trilogy"" you can pick up at any point in any book. even people i know who can't re-read books, can read his books over and over. they are exceedingly funny and very easy reading. you do need to be able to laugh at british humor, though."
2,Too many questions unanswered...,I was quite disappointed with this one. First of all the book's ending is very grim. I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now. And so many unanswered questions! What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her? What happened to Zaphod? Colin the robot? What is the question to the answer 42? What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems? What was the point to the people on Rupert? It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others. But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.
1,A book where even the author seems to have lost the plot.,"I am a huge fan of the other four Hitch Hiker books and was first in line to buy this book when it first came on sale. However I soon discovered that the origional books were very far removed from Mostly Harmless both by syle and humour. Occasionally during the origional series, most notably in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, the story would meander from the plot following what appeared to be the whim of the author. In Mostly Harmless the entire plot seems to be an ill thought out whim, a weak idea extended far beyond its humour or its point. It cashes in on the popularity of the series without giving any of its fans credit for being able to spot bad writing when they see it. Extremely disappointing."
3,Kinda like horror movies...,"...in that the last one usually isn't all that appealing. I liked it fine, with some of Adams's wit, but it was a bit disappointing. While I was a bit let down with Fenchurch's complete disappearance (I preferred her over Trillian), I was glad when, mercifully, Marvin was not present. Probably the only reason I read it was because it was included in my copy of the Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide, and also just to know that I read them all."
2,Mostly Harmless is mostly pointless.,"This is a book only for rabid fans of the Trilogy. Adams was obviously tired of the whole feckless Hitchhiker gang and used this last opus to unceremoniously dispose of them. While flashes of the old wit crop up here and there most of the book makes no sense until the end. And at the end you see the whole purpose of the plot line was contrived to vaporize the protagonists. It can best be compared to the second book, which ended on a dark note also. The second book at least had the saving grace of a lighter sense of humor. The fifth book's end is unremittingly black and will leave most fans enraged."
5,Truly brilliant. you'll hate it.,"This has slowly become my favorite book of the series. But then, i also think ""The Cable Guy"" was one of Jim Carrey's better flicks. The whole madcap insane story generates enough superficiality and disconnectedness to really shock your system when something truly serious and sad happens, with real repurcussions -- as in, Random.and another thing -- what with all the ""axes of probability"" and whatnot, who's to say Adams couldn't continue the series with Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and hell even Marvin, just incarnations of them along a very slightly modified probability axis? (or whatever)of course, only if he wanted to. i, for one, would welcome another tale with open arms. why not?"
5,ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE IT IS A TOTAL PRAT.,"This book marks a new beginning in the 5th of the trilogy which started with the equally excellent (and underrated) ""Hitch Hickers Guide To The Galazy"".Buy it today, or pay! (well, I suppose you will even if you do buy it, gee, never mind, buy it anyway)"
4,Mortly Harmless not so harmless after all.,After reading all the reviews of other people and reading the book I think that some of you might have a little misjudged the book. It does have its' problems such as not as many characters and I also noticed that the book is not as adventurous as some of the others. If you're not a real fan of these boooks you probably will be better off not buying Mortly Harmless but if you're the kind of person that likes The hitchhiker's books then i would strongly recommend to read this one also. It's plot can sometimes be lost but it still is fun to read.
2,The end is at hand - fortunately!,"I recall when this book came out that it was indicated by Mr. Adams that it was written in response to repeated demands for yet another story in the series. The fact that he was of the opinion that no more books should have been written and that this was undeniably the last one is clear through every page of the book. I personally own first editions of every one of his books, and I enjoyed them all. If you are completely insatiable and want to read more of his work, go ahead. If you think that ""So Long and Thanks For All the Fish"" was a great ending to the series and leaves all the characters where you want them, don't even look at this one! This is perhaps the most disappointing sequel since ""Scarlett."""
2,Mostly Useless,"The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there."
3,What the heck was that?,"As there are 110 other reviews at this point, I'll skip any summary.Instead, I have to say that this book was obviously written to tie up loose ends. Fenchurch just disappears with no emotional reaction, Arthur is just a carboard cut-out that the other characters react around, not react to, and Ford is... well, he's not himself.Some elements of this book were terrific. Some kept me laughing inside for days. But on the whole, this book was a bit of a let-down. The series went out, not with a bang, but with a whimper.It seems like this book was Douglas' way of saying ""Okay, this Hitchhiker's stuff is done. Will you please let me get down to business and write something else?""Unfortunately, we'll never have the chance to read the great books that were still inside his head, as he is gone. We'll miss you, Douglas."
4,"Extras are included on 1, maybe all 3","Despite what the previous reviewer said about all 3 DVDs in this series, I purchased Give Me Liberty at a store and it included all the Continental Cartoons, Biographies, Now and Then extra features. You just had to look for them in the Bonus menu.While I can't prove it, I suspect all these bonus features are also on the Boston Tea Party DVD as well, but seperated out as Bonus Features. That is a standard way DVDs are set up, as opposed to how tv shows are broadcast."
3,The best in the series,"Personally, I've enjoyed other books better, but this was the best mail order bride book so far. The plot is satisfying and not too fast like other Lacy books. Not a must, but a good read never the less."
4,braff understands,"if you are a soul that feels a bit awkward, that never really completely fit in, but find beauty in the dissonance/melancholy of life, and yet still have hope . . . this cd can be a great travel companion down that uncertain path of life. it might not change anything but it will keep you company."
4,Good music for road trips,"I really like this CD, but it seems a little too cerebral sometimes. Overall, I would recommend this CD and I appreciate the time that the actor in this movie put in to make the soundtrack match the mood of the film. Now, if only the same thing could have been done for Breaking Dawn (both parts). A good soundtrack would have really helped those two films. Where was Danny Elfman when they really needed him! Ha!"
2,Wow He's So Indie!,"God I didn't know how hip that guy from Scrubs was. This soundtrack is incredible like some kind of aural godsend! Where did he find all of this underground, totally wicked independent music? Answer: Ultra Chilled 02; search for it here or you can find it at your local library. Well I gotta go, Starbucks is calling. (That's where the totally sweet hipsters like me go and drink orange mocha frapuccino and talk about how much we hate W)"
5,"Song from trailer. NOT ""Let Go""","Does anyone know who does that fast, mellow song from the Garden State trailer? It's NOT Frou Frou's ""Let Go."" PLEASE please lemme know someone. Its drivin me nuts trying to find it. Email me at: truthfulactor@aol.com. I'd appreciate it."
3,good... but it's no Wicker Park,"When I heard the list of artists that would be on this sound track I got excited... Then when the track listing was finally announced, I was disappointed to find that it was a cool indie collection of songs I already had on CD or mp3. Don't get me wrong this is a good CD for someone looking to turn themselves on to some great new music, but if you are a fan of any of these acts its just nothing new. On the other hand I just read the track listing for the sound track to the movie WICKER PARK and it is filled with unreleased rare tracks by the likes of THE SHINS, THE STILLS and POSTAL SERVICE. I read that there is also a cover of COLDPLAY's the scientist on there too! So I am not trying to hate on this CD but I just think your money would be better spent on a compilation of songs that you could not easily get anywhere else. Check it out for your self."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Upon seeing Garden State and may I say what an amazing debut for Zach Braff, I had to check out the soundtrack. I can't get it out of my car's CD Player anymore. Awesome."
5,Mood elevator,"I've listened to this soundtrack over and over and never tire. There's enough variety in the instrumentals and lyrics to keep it fresh. No wonder it's nominated for a 2004 Grammy, up against soundtracks for Cold Mountain, De-Lovely, Kill Bill 2, and Shrek 2. I grew up in the Simon & Garfunkel era; this collection sends me into that same state of yearning, seeking, and expectancy. Great tunes, great lyrics, great addition to any music library."
2,Oh so indie,This is a great album to listen to - if you're a teenage girl who just lost her virginity.Remember that show Felicity - this is what Felicity would listen to on a rainy day after breaking up with her boyfriend.
4,"Mellow groove, borders on depressed","If you love the known bands on this compilation: Coldplay, Simon and Garfunkel, Nick Drake; you'll love this CD, and be excited to be introduced to some new names of a similar genre. I loved the movie and went right out to buy the CD. It is a great collection of tunes for a wistful rainy afternoon. These songs DO however tend to encourage that feeling of angst, woe-is-me ennui, so maybe not the CD to indulge when your antidepressants are running low."
2,Bootleg,"I thought this must be okay if Hugh Grant is in it, but I was wrong. The quality of this film is comparable to a bootleg copy recorded by someone in the audience. Seriously? Amazon should not charge to watch this movie. The Bengali scenery was interesting but due to the quality of the video the family begged me to put on something else, so after 30 minutes I did. As such I'll refrain from commenting on the plot (which had not yet emerged)."
1,"Cheap graphics, but worth a few hours of giggly fun.","Like another reviewer wrote, the eyebrows, hair and other graphics that you add to the picture to create the ""makeover"" look nothing like the pictures on the box! The ""makeovers"" end up looking pretty hilarious because the graphics are so cheap and they make the people in the pictures look more like clowns / cartoon characters than anything else.The digital pictures are really grainy and of really poor quality! My daughters set up a lamp which they used for illumination for the pictures, and this improved the image somewhat, but not nearly well enough, considering the price.I can't say I would buy this toy again if I could go back in time. I got this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas, and it was worth a few hours of fun her and her friends, but she has not touched it since the 28th of December, so I'm not sure it was worth the price... disappointing quality!"
2,Not for Skin of Color,My daughter who is african american (fair skin) got the digi makeover for xmas and my 2 complaints are as follows:1. Does not work well with skin of color as the skin appears to be much darker when the picture is taken.2. The product is not not very intuitive at ALL.
1,Believe the negative reviews about this product...,"Upon trying this product on Christmas morning, I was amazed at how poorly it worked and the false advertisement of its abilities. Judging by the other reviews, I was not alone. There is really nothing more that I can add that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. Read them and believe them."
3,Radica Digi Makeover,"Although my girls had lots of fun with this made for TV computer game, working on the pre-set models in the game was a lot easier than working on a picture of yourself. You have to have the exact lighting and pose and even then, providing you line eye color and make-up to a tee it only blends in well with the models and not with your own picture. Once the five or six models are done you have to save over them since you only get six picture slots to save in. The price is very high for this item and once my girls completed each of the models once or twice they were bored with the game."
3,The Ups and the Downs,"Digi Makeover is an okay game. On this game, you take a picture of yourself, and then you can chang your hair style, eyes, mouth, and face. The down parts of it is that you have to get your picture PERFECTLY right, or else the hair stlyes wouldn't fit with the picture. Also, the hair graphic's aren't that good, but they still work. but, the up part about it is that the makeover that you can give yourself. You can change the eye color, eyebrows, eyelashes, eyeshadow, lip color, and cheek color, and it looks pretty real. Over all, i give it three stars."
1,BIG disappointment,"What a piece of junk! My daughter received this for Christmas and it was a major disappointment for her. The instructions included were a joke & I finally called the 800 number just to figure out how to do the photo part. The picture quality was horrible, but we still plugged on, hoping for it to get better. We did get a good laugh at the hair styles - it looked like a forest animal had taken up residence on the top of my daughter's head. The other options were so difficult to operate and produced results that were a joke. I think it would be better to give your daughter old school photos and a bunch of markers. We boxed this thing back up and took it back to Target for a full refund. This is an expensive toy, but even if the price dropped to $5.00, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,It will ruin your clothes! WATCH OUT!,"The red color from the cover bleeds through ALL OVER your clothes when you use the steam setting of the iron. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't believe they haven't pulled this form the shelves. My husband's white dress shirts had BRIGHT red stripes all over them.... It washes out, but takes a couple cycles!"
3,all wrapped up in ribbons and ready to forget,"One common complaint of this film is that it has no focus and we wind up with something that is blurry even if it is trying to take a snapshot of something. It is like a collage of plots, stories, and fashion into one big piece of artwork. This is not to say that it can't be entertaining of course. People's tastes do differ. Not everybody likes modern art. Some people like something more traditional. I guess the highlight of the film would be the end sequence where you get to see the bevy of models that, like the story, has no clothes. And if you like looking at big bellies of a pregnant woman than this may be a film for you. It is what is on the inside that counts after all, not the superficial outside."
4,neglected masterwork,"Robert Altman's 'Pret a Porter' was slammed by critics on its theatrical release for its apparent sprawling, incoherent and superficial nature. But it's a film about the fashion industry. How could it be anything but superficial! Superficial it is, but it is also witty, intelligent, and ravishingly beautiful. And the integration of music with image is up there with the best -- wait for the end credits, as the final fashion parade takes place to Grace Jones's pulsating version of 'La vie en Rose'.My DVD copy is Region Two, and benefits from anamorphic mastering. But whether anamorphic or not, this DVD demands to be seen. Altman's work ultimately and resoundingly answers his critics, who simply cannot understand the nuances of this great director's work."
1,What A Mess,"I saw this movie at the show years ago when it first came out. I wanted to demand my money back. What a rip-off. What Leonard Maltin says in his review is right on the button. This movie has no plot, no momentum, and no point to any of this. Robert Altman is supposed to be this great director. But this movie looks like a college film school student made a very amateurish film and had no idea where to go with it. Its really bad."
3,Not for short people,"Great concept. Easy to install. Interaction with my son while I rode was great. BUT, like a previous parent stated, not made for short parents(I'm only 60 inches). I had to lower my seat just so I could touch the ground when it was installed. I can touch the ground when it's not installed because there's nothing in the center. Ended up getting a cramp in my butt and back of my thighs because the seat was too low and my knees were spread out farther than usual when I ride. Also, back muscles were strained from trying to keep from hunching over my son so I was extending my arms as far as I could. It probably would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if I were a taller person."
3,"Function good, but feels cheap","The plastic functions okay, but the netting is very thin and feels cheap. I know the net will need replaced sooner than later."
2,not worth it,"I thought this would be a great way to keep all of our athletic eqip. in one place so I purchased one and put it in our garage. I am very dissapointed with the red mesh net on the bottom. It stretched out and the supports that held it up are broken off. I took the netting off and now my kids use that space to put their rip sticks/ skate boards in. I placed a plain laundry basket next to this station and threw the balls, etc. into that."
4,A Great Movie,"This movie is a little far fetched but it is a movie after all...good music, good acting, and fun to watch for all ages."
1,Can you hear the music?,"I didn't really want to watch this movie to begin with, and sure enough, it was horrible. First of all, I believe the child was insane. It's basically a twisted musical version of Oliver Twist. It's one of the strangest musical movies ever! something I care nothing about. It was infuriating how the boy kept missing his parents by just a little. Also, NOT RECCOMENDED FOR SMALLER CHILDREN, his ""parents"" got him doing something well, um,.........sexual. Half the movie was flash-backs and I do think they did them well, It's sooo easy to make flashbacks confusing. All, in all, strange dumb movie; do not listen to all the other 5 star reviews, I hated it."
5,"Very Beautiful Story, Loved it","I don't have a single bad thing to say about this movie. It was so awe inspiring. The only negative about the whole thing is probably Robin Williams, but only because he was such a nasty character. The music used in the movie is so beautiful and the plot/story is one of the most inspirational I've seen in a very long time. The ending has to be the ultimate in movie endings, I've seen this close to five times and I've cried every single one of those. I would even recommend NOT renting, because you can save the money you would spend that way to purchase this movie since it is more than worth it. More so on blu-ray, the details and colors are amazing."
5,feel good movie,"Nice for the whole family! Just enough fantasy, real life, tears, and laughter to make a great movie for young and old alike."
5,Inspiring,I was sceptical at first... was reccomended by a coworker. I saw the film and BAM! LOVED it ! This is a feel good film and has a tear jerker ending... have Kleenix if you are watching this!!!
4,Wonderful Movie and Music,"This was a excellent movie, with no R rated contents and a meaningful story. I highly recommend it to everyone."
2,"Why Practice Music, Just Listen To The Wind, Or Whatever","I have to give this movie 2 stars because it looked like it was well done as far as photography, acting, etc., but it did seem a bit draggy at times. I had to turn it off at about the hour mark when the kid, upon getting his hands on a guitar for the first time, banged out music worthy of a skilled musician. Even used a piano style technique on the fretboard that would at least have gotten a nod from Eddie Van Halen. Please, give me a break. I get it. It's a fantasy. Maybe science fiction? Of course it takes hours of study and effort to get anything resembling music out of any instrument. Ok, maybe not a kazoo. I guess the sale of musical instruments will skyrocket now. If it left you with a warm and fuzzy feeling, I think that's great. Good luck when your child, expecting similar miraculous results, entertains you with their new electric guitar - or better yet, new violin."
5,August Rush,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I could watch it over and over. It was great and the music is excellent. I purchased the soundtrack so I can hear it all the time. Everyone should see it.
4,Straight to the Heart!,This movie just hit me straight at my heart... tender beautiful movie with a great soundtrack too. Will watch this movie a million times and never get tired.
3,Creative music is nice.,"I purchased this for a friend who liked the movie.I thought it was a little too predictable, however, I did like the music andthe creativity aspects of the story."
5,Love it!,"I had seen this movie several years ago, and had forgotten how good it was. The music was wonderful! And the story was heart-warming."
5,Loved it!,"We saw this move a few years ago, and have since watched it many more times, thanks to Netflix, but finally decided to buy our own copy. It is one of my husbands favorites, and that says a lot, considering he is an ""old guns and car wrecks"" type of movie guy."
3,badbones,"Movie gets high marks. The only negative aspect was Robin Williams role. He was miscast. The rest of the actors did well, mainly Hightower. Would have had the boys parents with him as the movie should have con't on showing them together as a family. Liked the music and the overall feel of the movie. Above average family feature. We need more PG than PG-13 rated titles."
4,....all you have to do is listen,"Evan is an 11-year-old orphan who hears music in all the things around him. His two passions in life are music and finding his parents, whom he is convinced are looking for him. His parents are actually unaware that he is alive, since his father never knew of his existence and his mother was separated from him by birth, falsely told that he was dead. Not surprisingly his mother is a concert cellist and his father is a singer and guitar player. When Evan runs away from the orphanage, he is taken under the wing of a street hustler (Robin Williams) who gives him a guitar and begins his musical career. There are lots of things in the movie that are very implausible, but this doesn't detract from a lovely story which is a real tearjerker and very satisfying viewing."
5,"Beautiful, hopeful and haunting - a must see","This is a great film with wonderful acting - including a very convincing bizarre Robin Williams. This sweet story has been superbly directed and edited to build tension with a lovely climax that leaves you wanting more. Appropriate for the entire family as an encouragement to reach for the stars in expressing your talent - very young audiences won't get as much from it and kids just entering the teen years need to be able to discuss some aspects with their parents, but overall, a lovely film about finding love and expressive the gifts you've been given."
5,DVD,"Great movie, One for most of the family to watch. Great music and even greater story line. I would highly recommend."
3,Nothing special but an interesting enough movie.,This movie was interesting enough to watch. It was inexpensive and worth watching. I would recommend giving it a try.
3,Pretty good movie,If you enjoy apocolyptic or post-apocolyptic movies then you will get a genuine kick out of this movie. Well acted and well shot and all on an apparently shoe string budget. This movie was well worth the rental fee and was very entertaining.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in movies of this genre or for anyone instersted in any type of action/adventure film or of any form of fantasy type of movie.I was happy with the rental. Would I purchase it for future viewing? Probably not but for a one shot deal it is very much worth a rental.
3,the lost future,"i didn't get to finish the movie, but will rent it again to see it inits entirety. since it was a rental"
2,Boring,"I really, really tried to like this, but it is soooooo boring. Like porridge with no salt and no butter. I had to let it go. Good luck!"
1,Very DISAPOINTED,"I bought this DVD without reading the reviews which was a mistake. I didnt spend a lot thank god because it was not worth much. it was a sales pitch for the Kreg Tool which made no real sense to me seeing most who buy this most likely already own the jig. Moreover, while building the cabinet he left out the instructions of how to build the damn door REALY!!! it was pre-built all he did was show how to install the plugs. The one thing most people have trouble with is building a good door and they skipped right over it. One last rant is there are no plans on the DVD and he only builds one cabinet."
3,One of the few Kreg DVD's that I like,This DVD is one of the FEW Kreg has put out. There are NO PLANS with this so you can't print them off and follow the DVD. John does go over the construction and mention most of the measurements though in this one and it turns out to be a nice piece you can actually use. The joints with Kreg Jigs are very strong -- especially when you put some glue down the board as well before screwing it. Kreg Jig *DOES* sell another companion dvd or cd that goes with all their DVD's and it has a plan for each in it but I've heard it's not any good either -- you can find it on amazon too here and look at the reviews yourself to make up your mind.
1,Pocket Hole DVD of Limited Value,I purchased the Kreg Master System and thought the DVD would be a good addition since I hadn't done pocket holes before. Much to my disapointment the DVD turned out to be more of a sales pitch than a tutorial on Kreg's system. In my opinion the DVD should have been included in the Master System. I wouldn't recommend this Video.
2,It was okay,"The textbook was in good condition, but the person who sold it to me was extremely highlighter happy. The information I'm trying to learn is difficult enough with out the explosion of colors and extra comments the seller added. I think I am going to buy another one...... no offence, but next time please include in the description that it has highlighted sections."
1,Recommended but not for the bit I bought,"I bought the Hitachi 5/8"" diamond drill bit. This product was recommended to go with it so I bought it. Upon arrival and reading the package it is NOT for a 5/8"" drill bit. Since it was an Amazon recommendation I assumed it would work with the bit I was buying. Assuming was wrong. Grant it if I had went to the actual item page it does indicate what sizes it is for and 5/8"" is not in the list. I am sure it is a good product but was misguided by Amazon with its recommendation to buy it along with my 5/8"" bit"
1,NOT A MICRO CASSETTE RECORDER,"I was quite upset to learn, after purchasing item and microcassette tapes, that this item is not a microcassette recorder. It is a regular tape player/recorder. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
3,"Paradise it's not, but it is an interesting read.","With a title like 'Paradise, New York', and a cast of characters who are primarily Jewsih, one enters this book with an Old Testament mindset- that is, we wait for the Fall. The Fall we get is somewhat pitiful as the Eden here isn't a land of splendor and endless earthly pleasure. In fact there doesn't seem to be any real pleasure, earthly or otherwise, here at all. What we do have is a group of interesting characters, though they are somewhat limited in what they do. There is an interesting Faust-ian subtext, and the book is interesting and well-written, once you get around the rhetorical questions used to establish interiority in the characters."
1,Don't be fooled-you CANNOT preview your photos,"... With the iclick, by seeing the picture of the camera, you would think the back of the camera has a screen where you can preview the picture.No.In fact, it is simply an LCD screen that tells you how many photos have been taken, etc etc. YOU CANNOT PREVIEW THE PICTURES YOU TAKE. ...clearly, by showing the photo of the back of the camera with the LCD screen, the consumer is very, very inclined to believe that this a preview screen for photos, so call that what you will. ... In my opinion, this takes away the greatest asset of digital photography. ...By the way, the flash is horribly weak, and the body of the camera flimsy. This being said, in the daylight, the pictures come out fine, as they would with most any digital camera. ..."
1,Overpriced Promotional Give-away.,"It looked and sounded good for an inexpensive starter, but when I got it, it felt like something I should have got free with a magazine subscription. The pictures are worse than the free web cam that came with my computer. Really, there are much better for the same price."
3,A bit of a wandering tale,This started out to be a good book - an historical biography of Maid Marian aka lover/wife of of Robin Hood. I guess I had anticipated it to be a bit more of just that...the story of her life before she met the famed outlaw and their relationship together peppered with her impression of him/his life/ his outlaw ways etc. That IS how it began. How it ended was as a second-rate murder mystery with Robin Hood and Maid Marian playing more of a role as undercover detectives than star-crossed lovers from different social spectrums. It was not terrible - but I felt like the author lost her way and suddenly 200 pages into the book had to find a way to end it.
3,"Ok, but only for a few months","Like others have complained about. The thing works great for the first few months then develops the death noise as it slowly eats its belt drive. I opened it up and tried everything from o-rings to rubber bands but couldn't get one to work for an extended amount of time. They were either too tight or just broke again after a little while.I finally gave up and bought another brand winder, so now I just use this to store and keep dust off my G-shock when I'm not wearing it."
2,Short Life,"Unit is exactly as presented, operates quietly, flexable progam, however it quit almost 1 year to the day after purchase. The circuit board and connections are first class, but evedintly the motors geartrain could be more durable."
4,Chicken Casing,The Chicken Chase has been a hit around our house. The 3 year old who received it love to race the chickens (or whatever else fits) down the track. His cousins love it as well.
4,"Fun, informative, excellent pace","As a relative newcomer to using pocket holes, I obtained a wealth of information from this DVD. The first few minutes of my video had quality control issues(shaking/jumping) but that cleared up before the project started and did not bother me enough to send it back and try another copy. The narrator not only shows how he accomplishes the various steps but explains why he is using one technique and the possible problems we may encounter. I enjoyed this dvd and I have accessed the handy chapter menu to brush up on individual procedures. A very reasonable price, I don't think you will be disappointed if you have an interest in either making tables or enhancing your familiarity with pocket holes."
2,INSUFFICIENT MATERIAL,"NEEDS MORE CONTENT, ITS NOT THE VENDORS FAULT. KREG HAS TO FILL UP THAT DVD WITH GOODIES -- THEY WOULD WIN IN THE END BY SELLING MORE GEAR -- MEATHEADMARKETINGSTRATIDGY"
5,Franklin and Winston,The book was received quickly and in excellent condition.I would definitely buy from this seller again.
5,I loved the item,"the book did come in perfect condition and it has been so helpfull in my coursethe book covers the majority of item that is taught at schoolas I am just starting using Matlab, I suggest it for those that do not have any experiencieon Matlab"
1,BAD PRODUCT. it does not work in ipod of 6g,"ipod of new generation works neither video nor photos. in ningun side says perdi my money that is responsible for so great deceit.I feel deceived in the purchase of my radius, this radius does not bring neither port usb nor for memory card, its only characteristic are the IPOD and in its publicity they do not say that the new generations of IPOD do not work my to understand is a swindle and there is no seriousness in its sales, I have always bought to pioneer and I regret to have bought a as bad product as this this same writing I will put it in amazon.com"
4,Pearl Harbor,"This movie has gotten a bad rap. I just saw it and it's very intense. They could have done away with the love story because it's simply the only boring part of the movie. The rest is complete mindblowing. The special effects are amazing and done in the most realistic way I've seen in a while. The only movie I could compare this to is TITANIC, which follows the same type of plotline, except Pearl Harbor is much more interesting and intense. The one other thing I would complain about on this box set is that you have to insert a second disc to watch the ending (might as well be on videotape or laserdisc)."
1,Whats wrong with you people?,"Oddly there is absolutely no mention in any of these reviews about how much protein there is in this protein based product. Does anyone know? after all its a protein meal replacement shake. I don't care about how pretty the box is or how little the calorie content is or if it tastes great. If a person is not getting the proper amount of proteins to support proper workout then the product is useless. Protein, Thats the whole point. i wouldnt buy this product based on the reviews at all because they miss the effectivness of most crucial ingredient. Sigh, For the record it has 30 grams of protein. (thanks for clarifying that for me Gordon.)"
1,I did not like them,This was a total waste for me although maybe not for you... I was looking for quicker pushin button disconnects
3,Well done ... but ...,"there are two many details contradicted by other sources for me to buy this one wholesale. Still, the story is presented in an intriguing manor."
1,The Massacre of Red Chief...,"Unfortunately, Hollywood has taken this entertaining, well written, short story and completely destroyed it! The story is drastically different; characters added and/or changed. I bought this for our homeschool class, but had to apologize to my child for the ""pain"" of watching. I wish I could return DVD's...actually, we should have been paid to watch this! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
1,Skipped 20 minutes into the movie!,"I was very excited to view this movie, as I was going to have my students compare/contrast the movie to the story they had just finished reading in class. However, when we started the movie it started to skip and stall 20 minutes in, leaving students asking questions about how the actual kidnapping took place! I was extremely disappointed!"
3,Great for compare/contrast,"I bought this movie to show to my 8th graders in English because we had just read the short story the week before.The movie surprised me in how far it strayed from the original story. I almost didn't show it.But, then I thought that this movie was a wonderful example of author's purpose, particularly in how thewriters of this film thought it was more imperative to depict the circumstances behind this child's erratic behavior,than to preserve the irony from the original story.Nevertheless, I showed my students the DVD and they came up with excellent Venn diagrams illustrating the extreme differences between the story and the film.So if you're a teacher, you might want to use this film to do a comparison with the story if you're reading it.But, be warned of how different it is from the short story."
1,A good product gone bad and deceptively.,"My former Sportline 330 was an excellent and 100% accurate instrument. This one is a totally different design and is useless. I never found out how accurate it is, because in the new design the reset button is in front of the device so you can't help but to accidentally reset it in the normal course of human motion. On the old one the reset button was inside its cover. This one has no cover. Useless. To add insult to injury, they don't tell you they changed the design, so it's a nasty little surprise when it arrives."
1,resets a little too easily,"I am so frustrated! I usually wear a pedometer all day, every day. I bought this one to replace a different brand in which the screen display stopped working after 2 months. This one was priced just about right, so I bought two for the inevitable loss or breakage that comes with daily use.This pedometer might be all right for a specific walk, but for daily use, it's useless. It resets itself frequently, so unless you are paying attention, you have no idea what your actual step count is. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
4,Fascinating study,I read this book over 20 years ago and still remember it as one of the most interesting things I ever read. Led to a lifelong fascination with POW situations and coping strategies. Lessons described in this book led to new approach to training military for possible POW situations.
5,"""Must"" reading for aspiring video producers & videographers.","Now in a completely updated and expanded second edition, Placing Shadows: Lighting Techniques For Video Production continues to be the best one-volume ""how to"" guide and reference on the practical fundamentals of studio and on-site location video production lighting techniques. Producer, director, videographer, Chuck Gloman collaborates with independent lighting designer Tom Letourneau to provide a superlative guide that covers every aspect of video lighting from meters and scopes to lamps and reflectors. Placing Shadows is ""must"" reading for all aspiring video producers and videographers."
2,doesn't live up to potential,"This book starts out strong with interesting ethnographic information on residents in inpatient and outpatient psychiatry. However, it becomes unwarranted and speculative boosterism for psychotherapy that has no relationship to the author's empirical work. The book is also in serious need of editing and is an organizational mess. I started it with great enthusiasm but was deeply disappointed by the end."
5,amazing,"If you put your bearings in the way most people do, hitting it with the back of a screwdriver or jamming it on a truck, you need to buy this, it takes about 2 minites to take out old bearings and put new ones in, and its always a perfect job and the bearing is straight and not broken or damaged. Great Product"
2,Broken stand,The stand is made of a cheap nickel material. Won't last a month under even light use. The brakes are very hard to adjust.
2,brakes are dangerous,Nice bike but the brakes are terrible. I had to go to the bike shop and order a pair of decent brakes. Figure on spending at least another $35+ on a set of brakes. The ones on the bike do not stop well and my 10 year old can not squeeze them. I am a grown man and I can squeeze them all my might and I still role to a stop. I am mechanical and adjusted them but it is a very poor design.
3,problem with the tires!!!,"The bike is efficient for petite women, but it does have a problem, 2 days before my race I have to find new tires...."
1,didnt work,"received the movie, was all scratched and wouldnt play on two different dvd players. very disappointed. will not buy any more used movies because of this"
4,very cute,Willow is a very family type show. The character Willow is very nurturing and cares a lot for the baby. I like the story a lot.
5,Awesome!,"I love this movie quite possibly more than any other movie made. I loved Madmartigan and Sorsha, the scenery, the plot, basically everything about it. It's just a wonderful movie. It's full of humor and great moments. Plus battle scenes. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. Rent it or something!"
3,Please Update The Product Details information,"I like this movie, but the item information it's not correct. This DVD don't have Subtitles, in Spanish only Subtitles on English. As latin american I've bought this movie because of that. I don't like movies with voices dubbed. I like hear the original audio with subtitles."
5,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,"I'll have to admit I have seen a lot of fantasy movies in my time. Most of them are really corny and stupid, but not Willow. Willow is an awesome movie filled with magic, dragons, trolls, brownies, and fearies as Willow makes his way across a daring adventure to protect a little baby from the evil Queen Bavmorda. Val Kilmer does a superb job as Madmartigan and the scenery in the movie is breathtaking. Not to be missed."
5,Awesome adventure,"I LOVE this movie! I sincerely hope they re-release it, because it will save me SO much money in late fees from the video store! I cannot comprehend how this movie ever got bad reviews, it has everything--humor, action, love, betrayal, magic, and adventure! It is a classic tale of good vs. evil--I have never met someone who did not enjoy it. You must see this! I command you! Go! Now!"
2,Willow,This movie was more than we bargained for. Lots of violence!! Did not care for this movie. We would no recommend to anyone. Poor rating.
2,A Lame Formulated Story,"A seriously lame, formulated story. The entire tale is based on believing its ridiculous beginning. The scenes seem to be very much copied from many moments of the Lord of the Rings, way before those movies were made. It's a professional Hollywood film; it has good acting and decent character interaction and tension. The special effects are decent for its time. But still, by the standards of 2008 movie making, it's not a very good film."
1,AWFULL MOVIE!!!,PLEASE save your money and buy instead any of the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings extended editions and not this piece of garbage!That fact that george Lucas directed this (see my review for Phantom Menace) shoulda warned me but I watched this anyway and boy was it BAD!George Lucas is not a directer of stories characters or actors he just throws BIG special efects on the screen and hopes it all makes sense and that you'll care. WRONG!You gotta have plot character and the mythic element of the hero for fantasy to work and to make great movies on the subject. I wish Peter jackson would remake this cuz it has some cool things in it like the two headed dragons [did they have cgi back then??] and the devil-dog creatures and the guy with the skull face but this is tipical of Lucas who likes to spend money on everything but a good scriptwriters and a good story. Oh well!
5,Great,I would have you refer to the Book review. George Lucas is pure Genius. He took a Novel and turned it into a Classic.
4,"""Good Fantasy!""",Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis star in Ron Howard's 1988 fantasy.A farmer and a swordsman protect a baby princess from an evilqueen. I've always liked this film and this dvd has good pictureand sound plus neat extras. I recommend this good fantasy.
5,Fantasy to the Heights,"Marvelously cast, well scripted, witty and surprising, this fantasy preceded the Ring cycle and included a host of mythic and magical motives excellently. Since fantasy must always contain some grim aspects of the reality it is trying to delineate and the evil it is trying to overcome, there are some horrible things here, some difficult to absorb, such as Sorsha taking part in the destruction of her own mother. But the heart in it is so good, the good wins out delightfully. A great film of its kind, one of the best."
2,Not up to par for Ernest Haycox,"Such an unrealistic story, Tracy Coleman is sent up to Montana or whereever this is, to take over a ranch left to its own devices for 4 long years by an old owner and in the meantime the basin ranchers in particular Dan Stuart owner of the Star Cross who is a mean spirited heartless type has decided that this ranch, the Horsehead is abandoned and they will vent the brands with their own and take over the headquarters and the range, there are two females in the story and they both love the as described homely Tracy Coleman who mismanages about everything he does in defending Horsehead, his entire crew is either shot or hung, there is way too much self anaylyzing among the characters, I have a very hard time believing that Ernest Haycox wrote this story, perhaps it was dug up and published after his death. If you want to read Haycox, don't start with this book."
5,Love this stuff!,"I absolutely love One Minute Manicure. If you haven't tried it before you will not be disappointed. It does a great job exfoliating and softening hands and feet. I play sand volleyball all summer long and one minute manicure is great at at rejuvenating my feet after hours of exposure to rough sand. Definitely worth the price and the 13oz should last a long time as it doesn't take much to make your hands/feet feel smooth, soft and luxurious."
4,Not Bad,"I ordered these not too long ago, they look nice and aren't bad, but they bend really easily. That shouldn't be surprising though, they're thin. I recommend them for anything with a lot of strumming, or a rhythm guitarist."
5,Tartar Treats,"Iams treats are without a doubt my dog's favorites. For some reason, they are not available in many stores, like Pet Smart, so I always order on line. Luvee gets one every night at bed time and goes crazy when she sees me open the bag. In my estimation, based on my dog's obvious preference, they are better than other tartar products."
1,Toro Trimmer? yeah right,"I purchased a Toro reconditioned trimmer. Problem is I received a Ryobi trimmer instead! (I have a Ryobi trimmer that is nearly new- only used 3 times and will not run. I am a mechanic and the parts to fix will cost more that the trimmer is worth)I am in the process of trying to get my money back, but the seller has not contacted me yet.Good luck if you decide to go out on a limb!"
4,The Lowdown on the Earl of Greystoke,"The author once indicated that the title was imposed upon him, but outside of the title, the book is thoroughly enjoyable. As with ""Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street,"" this book is a biography of the title character.In Farmer's case, he had to explain, among other things, how the young Tarzan learned how to speak, when the known great apes don't. Reconciling the history of Tarzan with what was known then, and at the time of the book's writing, was an exercise that took a lot of time and effort, and Mr. Farmer was up to the task.A family tree, linking Tarzan to other famous literary figures, is included."
5,Great way to purchase beading thread. More thread for less $!!,"I like using this size spool. 1) it's less expensive and 2) there is less waste, due to its length you don't have a lot of the end of spool waste."
5,"Consistently great product, arrived very quickly",Whis product is consistently great and arrived to my location within one day of the order. Very happy with the amount for this price. Packaging includes a small insert that demonstrates 2 different knotting techniques recommended for this material.
1,What a disappointment!,"Do not buy this book. It is written in a cold, uncaring manner, completely inappropriate for anyone touched by the disease. Sure it contains facts, but nothing else. It gives a depressing, negative portrayal of the disease. You'd be better off reading nothing at all. On the other hand, ""Living With Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide"" is the best resource out there. It is truly a must-have. Sorry I wasted my money."
5,An unrivalled resource,"About two years ago, when I began working with the Synodical Commission for Worship on a revision of our Church Year and Liturgy, one of the questions we asked was how we would be able to make the best use of the historic collects (opening prayers) of the Church Year in our new scheme.This book made it simple.Collected together for reference and comparison, Dudley's volume made it simple to research the history of the Collect in the usage of the Anglican Liturgy, from the Latin collects of the Sarum usage to the 1979 revisions and even into the late 1980's, this book covers the entire spectrum of opening prayers from throughout the Anglican Communion.At the price this book is offered at, it is almost a sin not to have it on your bookshelf. It is a truly indespensible resource for the Anglican cleric, or any cleric of the Western Rites with an interest in liturgical prayer."
5,Spiritual Disciplines for a Joyous Life,"Much of what J.P. and Klaus have written here derives from some of Dallas Willard's thought on the spiritual disciplines, but J.P. adds a personal touch that is new for him. J.P.'s openness and candor are refreshing. While this book may yet be challenging for some, if you have read J.P. in the past, I would say this is one of his easier reads. Nevertheless, it is well constructed and enlightening and every bit worth reading."
5,This IS the BEST version.,"Lyrically Amazing! Jay was rippin this with stories of the street life with phenomenal visuals and rhythmic wordplay. The b-side is also a cool track featuring Foxy B. However, we all bought this 12 inch for one reason. Reason being... Jay-z at such a raw stage in his rap career. A+++"
3,good view of the soviet side,this book is good on two fact :first he give a good view of the may 1941 soviet plan to strike germany .second he really describe well the chaos of the soviet hight command in the first day of the invasionthe bad thing of this book : he's two short and superficial on the military operations of the firts ten days
4,Under the sweet water rim,"Enjoyable read with a flowing story and high anticipation of what's gonna happen next. It is a classic L'Amour tale of rough men, lovely women, and adventurous travels of the Hero against numerous villians and hardships!"
3,"Great book, cheap copy.","The story is great and worth buying.The book was of the small-cramped-pages-with-cheap-binding variety, and it cost more than the price printed on the back cover."
1,This movie sucked!!!!!,"THe only thing mildly humerous in this atrocity of a video was the funky hair and the pointy shoes. But they even took that too far. If you are into self torture, you may be interested in this bland film, but otherwise, stay away from it like the plague. END"
1,This album is terrible...,"I became a fan of Coldplay back when Parachutes was released, and I have to admit that it took me a while to get into it, but once I did I was amazed at how beautiful it was. AROBTTH came out and though I only liked a couple songs on it, it was definitely so much better than this mainstream garbage.X&Y; is seriously one of the most dull and bland albums I have ever heard. And what shocks me is to see how many people are buying the hype.. X&Y; is far from being a masterpiece, it might as well be elevator music.Where is the Coldplay of old? I forgave them for AROBTTH, but I don't think we will ever get another good album from them. I miss Parachutes, but I guess that's the way it goes when a band is too taken by being the biggest band rather than writing good songs. What a shame."
2,Boring,"In short this CD is bland. The problem is all the songs sound the same! I bought the cd and listen to it throughout and it was just ok. None of the songs seem to stand out. I would get bored of a song before it ended and skip to the next track and continue to be bored. I was very disappointed because I liked there previous CDs. Though if you want a album to relax or sleep too, maybe this cd is for you."
1,Beautiful? Yeah right.,"Coldplay is the most overrated band this earth has ever met. These guys are like the Star Wars of music. Both things are totally overrated yet mindnumbigly dull.This album is terrible. The musicianship is lame. Chris Martin is one of the worst ""singers"" ever. No originality, no hook, no excitement is to be found here. Just a flat out boring Radiohead rip off. Thom Yorke should murder Chris (ala Varg Vikernes and Euronymous). If you want something beautiful check out Damnation by Opeth. They're metal but that album isn't. But it has passion great vocals (Mikael Akerfeldt>Chris Martin) and great musicianship. Unlike this boring pile of horses***."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"Let me premise this review with stating that I am a diehard fan of Coldplay, since the first time I saw them in concert before anybody really knew who they were and the second time I saw them at the Garden on their last tour.I waited patiently for this cd to come out thinking that since Coldplay has been so amazing in the past, topping themselves everytime, that this cd would blow my mind.Instead the first time I listened to it IT PUT ME TO SLEEP. ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME WITH A washed up boring sound and lyrics that are the worst ever!!!!IT WAS PREACHY AND JUST PLAIN BADTo make it worse I had already bought an overpriced ticket to their concert this year. I just hope they don't play too many songs from X&Y.;Overall, IT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE that was created around it.Maybe Coldplay has become just too commercial"
2,What is the BIG DEAL?,"I've heard all this hoopla about Coldplay and finally gave them a listen. I can sum them up in one word: BORING. People sell their children for concert tickets to listen to these guys play?I was expecting some catchy tunes and maybe some energy. Instead, these guys sound like they're sleepwalking through the music - I know I fell asleep listening to them. The funniest thing, is the biggest hit from the new album (Speed of Sound) sounds just like the biggest hit from the last album (Clocks).I'm not saying their music is bad, I just don't understand how they became a huge sensation. I guess its popular to jump on the Coldplay bandwagon right now. I'll gladly sit on the side and watch that wagon crawl by."
1,Poo On Coldplay!,"Coldplay is an overhyped band. They're almost as overhyped as Radiohead, but at least all of Radiohead's songs don't sound the SAME! They don't even give emotion about the music. Why does Chris Martin have to complain? He's knocked up Gwenyth Paltrow, is a freakin' millionaire, has droves of mindless followers, and yet he writes songs about how sad and lonely the HE is? Boo-hoo, I'm Chris Martin and I'm all alone in this unfair world and nobody loves me! What a loser..."
1,Sounds Familiar,"Is there a zero stars option? This CD is the biggest disappointment in music since Nelly. It was as if Coldplay found a song that people liked (aka ""Clocks""), redid that song 12 times and gave them different names."
1,I used to like this band but now...,"they are souless, flat, and repetitive - this CD is very, very disapointing - better to go back to the first two CDs."
3,Pretty Good,I guess I didn't know too much about Coldplay before my purchase. I had heard a couple of their songs on the radio that I liked so I purchased the CD. I found all the songs/music sound the same. Very dull.
5,Believe The Hype,"Folks, this is one time where I can confidently say that the hype is credible. Believe it. It's not fabricated just for your benefit, it's real. This album is authentic, bold, and daring. The quality of this album has been understated. This is a significant improvement over their previous works. Some of the high-brow reviewers have obviously lost touch with the modern universe if they think this album is anything less than a masterpiece. I could just imagine a song like ""Twisted Logic"" playing over the closing credits for a movie like ""War of the Worlds."" It's got such beautiful dark, rich tones. I hope this album marks the beginning of an extraordinary career for Coldplay. They truly deserve it."
2,Disappointing...,"If you liked Rush of Blood, you'll probably enjoy this. However, it would be nice to see the biggest band in the world right now take advantage of it and make somethng besides a carbon copy of their breakthrough album.If you want more of the ""Coldplay sound"", this album is for you. If you want something sonically and lyrically challenging, you'd be better served to look elsewhere.One last thing on the lyrics. While some of them are decent, several of the songs are ""laundry lists of cliches"", to quote another reviewer. The verses to ""Fix You"", for examples, are so cliched and saccharine that they could give you a sugar high."
1,disappointing,"I didn't need Coldplay to reinvent themselves, but this is one long tired album of depressed sounding songs. Chris Martin, doesn't Gwyneth inspire you to write more poetic lyrics? I became such a huge fan after A Rush of Blood to the Head, and songs like Fix You and What If? fail to inspire me as a musician. This band is talented, but this body of work shows little creativity. I'm selling this back ASAP. I feel used for buying into the hype, and for assuming this album would blow me away."
1,The simplest way from x to y is a straight line,How can being so mediocre garner such high praise? Maybe because Coldplay manages to tread a line that is inoffensive as possible to as many people as possible. A bit like most mass market consumer products.
2,The Air Supply of the New Millennium,"If you want to give these guys credit for anything, they certainly deserve credit for taking soft rock all the way to the top again. They should be called Radioplay because they take basic elements of the Radiohead sound (not the experimentation) and set it to easy-on-the-ears melodies, beats, and lyrics. ""Lost in Love"" has nothing on this one. I'm actually eagerly anticipating the Coldplay covers album of Air Supply. ""All Out of Love"" with a brittle beat--that will really be something!"
2,An Adult's Review,"The first two songs are pretty good, but Chris Martin's yodeling really grates on my nerves by about the seventh track. If it weren't for his annoying way of singing (the guy has a great voice - I just don't like what he does with it ALL the time), this would be a better album."
1,Why so much radioplay for radiohead ripoff?,"Ok, so rush of blood to the head was ok, but this album is really sad and it is so over-rated. How can this band be so popular? The singles are annoying after 3 listens. Lets just face it. This band is a really poor radiohead ripoff. Get O.K. Computer instead. Coldplay always sounds like they are trying so hard, but they always fail to make anything more than cliche. Their melodies suck. Their arangments are uncreative. They just sound straight up anoying after a while. Don't buy this unless you want to be a pathetic slave to the mass media music market."
1,The Song Talk Is a Ripoff!,"go get the song ""computer love"" by KRAFTWERK off their 1981 album ""Computer World"". Coldplay Ripped off that song with their song ""Talk"". ITS BULL CRAP!"
1,Their worst album!,"I was utterly disappointed by this album. The lyrics are easy and lazy. There is no tension and there is a lack of lyricism found on their first and second albums. The guitars and percussion parts are beautiful, but the album doesn't push any further boundaries or explore new avenues. I loved ""Parachutes"" and ""A Rush of Blood To the Head"" so much they made me cry with appreciation. ""X & Y"" makes me cringe in embarrassment for these talented people in such a unenthused and idle state."
5,Coldplay did it again!,"This is another wonderful CD by Coldplay, and it's a must have for your collection. I think this is their best CD yet. Go ahead, buy it, you will not be disappointed."
3,Hmmmm....,"Let me put things this way...I bought Coldplay's ""X&Y;"" and Beck's latest album ""Guero"" on the same day.. Since then, I have been listening to Beck at least 4 times as much as I've listened to ""X&Y;""...Explanation: Beck = experimental, ever-changing, kick ass musician...Coldplay = talented band, but...Hmmmmm...Haven't I heard this before??"
1,The final Wimpification of Rock,"My girlfriend loves these guys. She thinks they are SOO SEXY. Not one to dissapoint my girl, I gave them a listen.First off, my ears fell off. Second, my libido diminished and I haven't been in the mood for sex for weeks now. Thirdly, my CD player spit the album out with BILE!WHY, WHY, WHY are these guys famous? They have nothing to offer the rock world, not image, not songs, not lyrics, not talent.Yeah, these guys need to be ""fixed"" all right, fixed as in neutered and spayed. Ted Nugent, please come back and restore manliness to Rock!!!"
3,What's all the fuss about?,"Everyone raved about this cd, and it certainly got plenty of publicity -- particularly about the cover art, but apart from a couple of songs, I wasn't overly impressed with this cd. A lot of the songs sound virtually identical.If you really like specific songs (noise, fix you), buy the songs online and download them to your MP3. Don't waste your money on the whole cd."
2,Deafening Hype,"I've tried to hear through both types of hype for this third Coldplay release. Yet with the media buzz, the band itself touting its (playful) competition with U2, and the full ubiquity of their music everywhere, it's near impossible to hear X&Y on its own merits. So let's say this: the lyrics are hopeless, mostly built on cliches and the ache in Chris Martin's voice (their secret weapon, I say); there is a ballad or two that will definitely light up a Bic (""Fix You"", for sure); the best hook on here is appropriated from Kraftwerk (""Talk"" -- best song, worst lyrics). And I think it was all a bit fresher when it was more unassuming."
2,Definitely Coldplays Least Best,parachutes and rush of blood are fantastic albums. This album is a bad mixture of U2 and Radiohead. No songs really jump out at you. the albums lyrics are shallow and the music is very bland. This was the album that was supposed to take them to the next level. the only reason coldplay will sell more albums and concert tickets because of this record is all because of hype.
1,its a shame,"Coldplay has now completely sold out to the pop music media. I used to like em. Parachutes was good and id recommend that. A Rush of blood to the head was ok but X&Y is contrived bullsh*t for the masses. Don't buy this CD. If your thinking of X&Y as your intro to coldplay you will be disapointed. This is by no means the bands best work. On the other hand, if you enjoy artists like Keane, Howie Day,or Kelly Clarkson then this is ""like totally"" for you....."
3,Best Cut is the bonus track....,"This is a good CD, very much in line with what Coldplay does and they'll no doubt make a bundle on it. It doesn't push any boundaries or advance the band in the way RUSH did compared to PARACHUTES, and maybe it would be too much to expect another huge leap forward at this point. The band has to deal with Gwyneth now and Apple, and that may prove to be its Ono-ization. Hope not, but family tends to distract you. Whatever. Given that they could continue at all is something of a miracle. All the classical CP elements are in service, and most of it fits just where you'd expect. Sometimes that's a noble thing in itself. It is the acoustic bonus track that will grab you, though, as it seems to point to where they'll go next, assuming there isn't another live CD/DVD, or that one of the other lads doesn't hook up with an ubermodel/actress. Remember when rock bands faced crises because the drummer had a brain tumour?"
2,Fan says this isn't as good as the first two,"I am a big Coldplay fan, but I must say that X&Y; doesn't approach the first two albums. If you want a Coldplay album, start with either album before X&Y--Parachutes; or Rush of Blood to the Head.X&Y; does show glimpses of the former greatness, but overall it's a bland and uninspired offering from this talented group. Chris Martin already said this was their last album, so maybe they know they've run out of ideas."
4,Great new album,"Those who are complaining about too much similar material - you are wrong. Except the starting of 'Speed of Sound', very little else is. Infact, most songs are much better than their old counterparts. The previous two albums were very innovative no doubt, but I had to keep skipping while playing some of those, whereas, the whole X&Y is good to listen to. The songs are more mature, more energized, and more thoughtful. My picks, ""Fix You"", ""Square One"", and ""Swallowed by the Sea"". And go blame the media for the media hype, not the artists."
1,I can't stand Coldplay,"What really bugs me about coldplay is people think they're a real band. They sing off these tired sentimental cliches and people think they have substance. To me, they're no different than boybands like Nsync. They're every bit as contrived, preconceived, concocted, and ""for the masses"" produced. Actually, they're 10x worse. Everyone knows what Nsync is - a money making machine - and no one trys to pretend differently. Coldplay tries to pretend like their music is for the good of humanity or some sh*t. That clown Chris Martin and his Make Trade Fair B.S. It's all part of the Coldplay package. And idiots are actually taken in hook, line and sinker and buy their mediocre music. They're just another greedy money making machince. Don't be part of their target market. Don't buy"
2,Disappointed,"I was a coldplay fan since their first album was released,but maybe not anylonger after listening to the new album twice. The only word that can correctly express myself is disappointed. They seem to have lost all their musical ispiration to making any breathtaking ballads.There is NOT a single song in XY can surpass or even meet the height of the first two albums. X&Y; is more like an easylistening album than a rock album with ""depth"". The lyrics are just forgetable. I tried very hard but still can NOT find a highlite in it. DOn't want to say anymore.Disappointed"
2,disapointing,"I'm a big Coldplay fan and absolutely adored the last two albums.I can honestly say that there isn't one song in Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head that I don't like.When I listened to this new album for the first time I had big expectations and was basically hoping for more of the same.Unfortunately my worst fears came true in that Coldplay have basically run out of ideas in this album.I've tried listening to it a few times in the hope that it would grow on me like the previous albums but i'm afraid the majority of this album is just plane boring and completely unentertaining.I see a lot of reviewers on this site obviously enjoy this album, one even going as far as claiming it as the best coldplay album yet.I only hope that as the singles are released and i am bombarded with them every day on radio i too will see what these other people see in this album, unfortunately i doubt it."
3,Disappointingly MOR,"A competent, yet uninspired new disc from Coldplay. They have definitely crossed that creative line into the MOR (""middle of the road"") this time. Hopefully, it is only a temporary swerve than permanent direction...It certainly fits that I heard their song, The Speed of Sound over the PA system as I was picking up a couple items at the local supermarket... URGH!Cheers"
2,"....Actually not illiterate, just well under ten years old.","In my daughter's defence, the new Coldplay CD is hugely disappointing. Muzak, almost. Spurred on by rave reviews in Q magazine and other reputable journals I gave X&Y repeated listens and almost persuaded myself of it's worth. I then played Sea Change (Beck) which I had bought at the same time as the Coldplay album. The contrast blew Chris Martin and his weary, formularic ditties clean out of the water. There is nothing on X&Y which has the power to stop you dead and and force you to listen as Yellow did,for example. This music is not from the heart,if Coldplay are now reduced to Stadium rock and the brandishing of Zippos then their moment has well and truly passed."
2,DISAPPOINTED.....,"I was so excited for the new Coldlay album to come out and when I bought I was very disappointed. A Rush of Blood to The Head was intense, emotional and deep and I don't get any of that from X&Y. I expected it to be better than A Rush of Blood to The Head but I'm disappointed to say that, in my opinion, it is not. The music is very good and it is a different sound for Coldplay but the lyrics sound like they were put together without any thought. They seem shallow to me and like they were put together just so they could get an album out. I would have to say that my favorite songs on the cd are Talk and White Shadows only because of the music...the lyrics on this cd disappointed me greatly."
1,STOP BRAGGING ON ABOUT COLDPLAY! I'M BORED!!,"WHY DO YOU PEOPLE BRAG ABOUT THIS UNTALENTED, OVERRATED STUPID BAND ALL THE TIME!!! I'M SO SICK OF IT!!!! AND ON ABOUT THIS BAND? FINE THEN, SUIT YOURSELVES!"
1,Making music to make money.,Radiohead is about 32 times better than this BS band and they were about 10 years ahead of their time (The Bends came out in 1995). And are still releasing amazing albums today.
1,Music For Sheep That Look Like People,"If you really enjoy lounging in a pair of Dockers on a Sunday afternoon with your girlfriend that won't put out as much as you wish but you smile because you're happy, Coldplay is for you. If you find yourself saying, ""God, my life is just so busy"", this is your album. If the Cure are too depressing and Slayer are ""just too loud"" and Swans are just another pretty bird, this is your soundtrack. If you find your mailbox containing more wedding invitations each year, bring this along for the trip. You will love it, the wedding party will love it and you can all clink your Heinekens together as you laugh and collectively wonder when the next Abercrombie and Fitch catalog is coming out."
2,Please Fix It,"This is an OVER PRODUCED album. I am pretty sure that the four men of Coldplay could have used their money on something a litte more meaningful than this pittiful album. Martin's lyrics are totally annoying and Buckland is trying way too hard to sound cool while playing the guitar. The boys should stick to what they know; and that is piano, acoustic and base."
2,Computer Love,"Coldplay have been decidedly boring since the beginning. I don't really have a problem with any of their music, when it comes on the radio i just sort of tune it out. Until a few days ago when the song 'Talk' came on the radio. At first I thought ""oh, cool someone covered kraftwerk and it's actually getting played on the radio"" but then the vocals started and I said aloud, ""my god, no!"" I'm still outraged that they had the audacity to blatantly rip off the melody from 'computer love'. This goes way beyond simple sampling. I have now lost what little respect i ever had for coldplay. Do yourself a favour and buy Kraftwerk's 'Computer World' instead. It's a much better album, and it's all original."
3,Not the best vinyl pressing,"I bought this in vinyl as it is a recording that I enjoyed as a CD and I've been repurchasing some things in vinyl. While promoted as an audiophile vinyl product, it's a crappy Capitol pressing, punched off center, with poorly finished edges and label. Bad handling and packaging of vinyl by Amazon makes it all worse. FAIL."
5,Don't give up on it,"Those of you who think this album is crap: don't give up on it that easily. It takes a few spins to really come alive. When it does you will be amazed. The most accessible tracks are ""Fix You"" and ""Speed of Sound."" The other songs may not move you until you listen to them several times, then watch out! You'll get a rush of blood to the head :) I think this is Coldplay's best album yet. Bigger brighter and packed with emotion. I've been listening to it nonstop for two weeks now and it gets better and better with each listen."
1,Boring boring boring,All the flap over this overrated band demonstrates the sad sorry state of music today. This extremely derivative band throws in a dash of this and a dollop of that and everyone goes gah gah. Geez. I found this lp extremely pedestrian and homogenized. If you like your music cream puff then you will dig this. Music for cream puffs. yep. that about sums it up.
2,U2 reincarnated,"I love parachutes and the previous EP brothers and sisters. i thought Rush of blood to the head was a bit to hard for what they were going for but still good for some listening. also, i love war and under a blood red sky by U2. i found a copy of achtung baby also by U2 around the same time that i got a copy of X&Y. the similarity in the fall was striking. they both went completely against why they were good. i mean,the insturmentals in this album are really dull and the lyrics arent catchy or intersting. really it all goes downhill from square one (pun intended) the best song on the album, which is sad because it is a definite 3 out of 5.similarly U2 went all...flaky. like parachutes but bad. well, i allready have 2 albums and an EP to be happy with. stick with those. Or make your own band. best of all go read a book. or write a book. the point is i wouldn't advise buying the album."
5,Top notch,"After one disregards all the hyped expectations for the much-anticipated X&Y, it's not hard to appreciate the album's consistent high quality. I don't think anything tops ""Clocks"" or ""The Scientist"", but Coldplay keep their momentum with strong tracks like ""Square One"", ""Talk"", ""Speed of Sound"", ""Low"", and ""Twisted Logic""."
5,The Archetypical Coldplay Album,"What a masterpiece! Combining the sultry emotion of ""Viva La Vida"" the casual beauty of ""Parachutes"" and the melodic complexity of ""A Rush of Blood to the Head,"" Coldplay has crafted a fluid and masterful album in the vein of U2 and even ""The Beatles.""Highly recommended!"
3,Just Ok,I read this was just was different from other books Ihave readof hers. Was a little disappointed not the Fern I am use to
4,Wish List,Great Story.I like all of Fern Michels books. A must read for any one that enjoys Michels.Good reading and relaxing. Hated to put the book down.
2,terrible,This is just like any other law book on the market. It is designed not to help students learn but to keep them somewhat confused throughout the semester. You'll have to buy supplements to really learn the material. Buy it if your prof requires it otherwise don't. Pulling an old outline off the internet is so much more helpful than reading the case book.
3,"Good, but too much unnecessary information","This book does a decent job explaining crim pro concepts....once you get past all the side arguments and irrelevant discussions that is. The 4th Amendment Search and Seizure issue is a large portion of a Crim Pro class. Accordingly, it's a big section in this book. However, I find the 4th Amendment discussion is not only poorly organized, but also contains TOO MUCH information. There are too many side arguments and too much irrelevant discussion. It's almost like reading the textbook. While I understand the 4th Amendment issue is largely unclear and there are not many bright line rules, this book could have gotten that same point across in much less text. I REALLY liked Dressler's Understanding Criminal Law, which partly made me get this one, but this one isn't nearly as good. If you can get past all the unnecessary discussion to find the parts that your professor focused on, it's a decent book."
4,Ever funnier than the first.,"restaurant at the end of the universe is a rare event in literature, or most art for that matter. It is the sequel that surpasses the original. I read Hitchhiker's in fifth grade and I find it hilarious even today. However, Restaurant is even funnier than the first. If you have read Hitchhiker's and maybe didn't find it very enjoyable, I implore you to read its sequel. It will not let you down."
2,Impossible to read,"I found this book impossible to read. I enjoyed the first book, but this book... after one chapter I stopped reading and tossed it aside. Very verbose and just not that interesting or funny or anything...."
5,Excellent one topic book,"I own thousands of cookbooks, and this is one of the better one topic books I have run across. All the recipes are easily prepared with easy to find ingredients, and of the 10-12 I have made so far, all have been very tasty. This book will get you out of the typical beef and bean type nachos and into a new world of taste. A lot of the combinations also make excellent pizzas."
1,Difficult to locate technical specs for this item,"For some reason, the PDF of this product's manual is over 20 megabytes. And once you have downloaded it, Acrobat 5 reader says the file is damaged and unreadable.Other PoGo products have manuals which are approx. 2 meg; I don't understand why this one is so large. I am trying simply to locate the precise information about the different recording qualities offered by this device, not as vague ""good"" or ""high quality"" but as a number of kbps at different settings. So far, I have not been able to locate this information."
2,She could have earned 5 stars BUT...,"My screening test for books on infant and child health is looking up what they have to say on breastfeeding and sleep. Robin Barker is an advocate of controlled crying. I personally am not and find this technique most disagreeable. I do realise that many parents will not agree on me on this one and it certainly is widely advocated amongst paediatricians still.I was most disappointed to see the suggestiong that weaning breastfeeding after 9 months was okay. This goes against the Australian recommendations and I was wondering what Ms Barker would give an infant between the ages of 9-12 months.Otherwise it is a very thorough book. However because of these two areas I won't buy the book and I won't be recommending it.Shame, as she has a lot of good things to say about other things and her book ""Babylove"" is very thorough. I can't remember what it has to say on breastfeeding or sleep though, having only flicked through the book at a friend's place."
2,Could've Been Much Better,"If you're looking for songs like ""Goodies"" ""1,2 Step"" or ""OH,"" you won't find them on Ciara's new CD. This is dance/club music but everything sounded the same to me and not much stood out. Most of the heavy beats on here drown out Ciara's light vocals. ""Promise"" and ""C.R.U.S.H"" are good tracks, but other than that I'm disappointed. Even though Ciara says she has important things to say in her music, ""The Evolution"" isn't helping to get her messages across. Overall, this CD isn't anything you haven't already heard on the radio."
3,coool,i bought my cd form Best Buy popped it into my computer the tracks playfine but the Track Listing is Brian Mcknights 10... whats the deal
1,CD was scratched,I bought this CD as a gift and was upset when I learned that many of the songs were scratched/skipping. Guess it was some type of manufacturer's defect but I wont buy CDs from Amazon again.
3,"Nice, Sweet, Pretty, Yes, Evolution, um, No.","I love playing Ciara's last album in my SUV. It makes everyone in it smile. We know all the lyrics and the beats bounce, so i , like many had high hopes for this one. It definitely feels like a Jazzy Phe Productions, unfortunately, it also sounds like Cherish and a handful of other Jazzy Phe Production... Is this an evolution of the last project. No, its not. Janet, often sourced as an inspiration, actually seems to be regressing, musically, sounding less like Janet and more like ""Produced By"". I think Ciara sounds ""Produced By"" as well. Try Brooke Valentine, she tried, and succeeded in taking a ""Step Up"" and i look forward to her evolution as well"
1,NO EVOLUTION ON THIS ONE.,"IT'S NOWHERE NEAR ""GOODIES"" EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T BUY GOODIES (I HAD A FRIEND MAKE ME A COPY) I WENT OUT TO BUY THIS ONE, AND I WASTED MY MONEY. SHE NEEDS TO STICK TO HER STRONG POINT (DANCE SONGS) CAUSE DA ONLY MID-TEMPO SONG DAT ARE GOOD ARE ""PROMISE"" AND ""C.R.U.S.H."" NOW I SEE WHY SHE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO COMPARE HER TO JANET, CAUSE SHE'S NOT ABLE TO DO MID-TEMPO AND SLOW, BABY MAKING SONGS LIKE MS. JACKSON. I GIVE CIARA ONE MOREALBUM, AND THAT WILL BE ALL WE WILL HER FROM HER AND HER ""MUSIC CAREER"". P.S.- SHE CAN'T ACT EITHER."
1,It doesn't get any worse than this.,"I should not have made this the first shockumentary video that I watched. I came away wondering if all such videos are so poorly edited. Some of the scenes appeared twice in the video. There was little narration, and when the narrator did speak, she provided no details about the time or place of the scenes. The music made the video laughable at times.The back of the video's cover promises all new material, but a lot of it already appeared in _Mondo Magic_--a video that I recommend much more than this one. Also some of the scenes come from World War II and are obviously not new. The only shocking thing about this shockumentary is that people could have made it in good conscience."
3,DO NOT READ NOVEL SYNOPSIS,"Because it does not occur between the covers. Apparently, Bill changed his mind at the last second and do not have Ben Raines and his Rebels heading to Northern Maine. Instead they make it to New York City...meet up with some resistance fighters who are battling punks and thugs...etc and eventually clear the town. Then the Rebels head to the desert southwest to finish off the gangs headed by Ray Brown...who is a killer of animals...children and the elderly. In the end...justice is served...the way it should be in today's society. Two stars for the wrong synopsis...four for the story...equals three. Will continue to follow the Rebels to the end."
1,An Awful Book Masquerading as Wry Wit,"I set this one aside after 50 pages, when it became clear that it wasn't going to get any less tedious.This book is not particularly interesting and not at all informative. Supposedly, it is humorous, but you have to be really British or badly constipated--or, probably, both--to think so. The only reason for its existence seems to be the author's smug academic self-admiration, and his ability to convince a publisher that it's justified.I can't imagine why anyone would read this thing. There's just nothing there."
2,Just fair.,"When you slide it past the edge of the table, the fence drops down. Needs a back rail or a spring. It has way too much adjustment. Too easy to get it misaligned. You must unscrew the fine adjuster to take off then fence. A big minus. The anodized metal isn't bad. It's just far too floppy for my taste. For the price, they should do better."
5,great study aid!,"This was my go-to study aid for my psych rotation. The cases show how the patient would present to you, and then explains the psychopathology, then asks comprehensive questions that often help you differentiate between other things that may be on the differential."
3,STOP Read Review Before Buying,This DVD is only 13 minutes Long (yes I know the magic #13 again) not 60mins even though it's from the TV show 60mins.basically it's short video clips from Taylors Speak Now Tour at Staples and a Quick Interview for that your Paying over $1 a minute to View. and was broadcast for FREE on TV when the show first aired - to me this isn't worth the money
4,Low Port by,"Overall this compilation of stories was very entertaining. The characters are the commoners needed to make things function for the upper crust. Surprisingly, the only story I didn't care for was ""Gonna Boogie with Granny Time"" by Sharon Lee. I found it ""uncomfortable"" to read, if that makes sense.However, I definitely recommend this book."
3,Incognito Bees and flowers and things,"CD came quickly, no problems, but actual CD is a lot of remixes of incognito's old stuff. Wouldn't necessarily say that the remixes are better than the original tracks on my other CDs."
2,"Jack, Knave and Fool","I have read several books in this series but found this installment disappointing.Alexander seems unable to break out of the ""someone's been murdered and the characters must find the culprit"" plot mode -- even within the mystery genre, surely it's possible to be more creative than that. Jack, Knave and Fool is talky and forgettable, with much of the action and drama happening offstage. The characters change little and never seem personally challenged. Jeremy's ""voice"" has developed somewhat, but that's not enough to save this honestly rather boring book. Strange pseudo-archaisms on the order of ""Nicely dressed she was"" add an annoying touch."
3,5 star workout ruined by 2 star trainer,"These workouts are great--intense and focused. 10 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to fit in a workout during nap or before the kid wakes up in the morning. I can commit to 10 minutes, then if I get another one I feel like it's bonus. Pilates is excellent cross-training, especially if you're running or biking. I've never felt sore or tired after yoga, but I always do after pilates.Unfortunately, the trainer is annoying. She's smug. I'd never return to her class if it were in person. She explains things clearly enough to follow and clearly knows what she's doing, but...bleh. I can handle her for 10 minute chunks of time, but can't even imagine an entire hour."
3,I just need more excitement,"I bought this on the recommendation of a co-worker for two reasons; I have so little time between work and dinner time and this has 10 minute segments AND I wanted a good core workout but have never tried Pilates before.That said, I have been a fan of The Firm DVD's because I like moving around. I tried this for a couple of weeks and soon got bored with it. First of all unless I don't know what I'm doing, it got annoying having to reset the segments that I wanted to do each session. There is a break between each session that is way too long for my likes. Sooo...I got rid of it.Guess I'll have to stick the more active type excercise so I just purchased three more of The Firm DVD's which is more my style."
5,Great!,This is a really great DVD! I love how you can choose your own workout or just follow along with hers! This is the perfect DVD for people in a rush!
4,Fabulous workout!!!,"This is a MUST HAVE pilates DVD. The moves are awesome, and while you are doing it, you can feel the fantastic burns, and the stretches release the tension in your body so efficiently. The only thing that I can complain about is the breathing, I feel hard to keep up with it, the fast and forced inhales and exhales are so unnatural, I guess it takes a while to get use to. I especially like the lower body and stretch sections. As for abs, whenever I'm doing ONE HUNDRED or double leg/single leg stretch, I don't feel much around my abs, but very tense on my neck, I guess that's my weakness point. But overall, this DVD is well-structured, very well interpreted and easy to follow (only a few moves are advance for newbies like me)."
5,I like,I'm new to pilates and enjoy doing this video. I feel like my whole body has gotten a workout after finishing the first three segments.
2,OK But not for beginners,"I suppose this workout is okay for someone already in fairly good shape, but for anyone overweight most of the exercises are almost impossible to do. Most of the exercises require that you be able to bend really well and if you are overweight and trying to get in shape you should start with something else that doesn't require this amount of flexibility. It would have helped to nost waste money if they had said this was not meant for overweight people or beginners."
2,Not for beginners,"This workout is not for beginners or, in my opinion, people with bad backs or neck.The instructor suggests starting with the workout for abs if the viewer is new to Pilates and also mentions that she will have modifications throughout. She starts off with some fairly challenging exercises (which is fine) but doesn't really offer any modifications beyond ""bend your knees a little more"" or ""make sure your back doesn't arch"". Towards the end of the ab workout she moves on to very challenging exercises that I found impossible to do without wrenching something important. I'm sure the workout is great for someone more advanced and familiar with Pilates, but it seems just too easy to get hurt as a beginner."
5,This was a very challenging workout.,"I can usually pull off doing two or three exercise DVDs a day, but this DVD wore me out on it's own. I recommend it for anyone who needs more of a challenge in their workouts."
3,Good for beginners!! Expecting Advanced work out,"I read the reviews before buying, however looks like didn't read enough to determine that this is good for beginners!!but not for those who are looking advanced work out."
5,Much harder than the Rapid Results version!,"I previously purchased the 10 Minute Solutions: Rapid Results Pilates which also featured Lara Hudson. I got great results from it. I wanted to change up my routine and purchased this DVD and felt it was challenging. The bunds and thighs segment is pretty much on par with the Rapid Results version as far as level of difficulty, but features different exercises. The ab segment is much more difficult than the Rapid Results version. I could really feel the burn. The exercises are challenging without being confusing. You don't have to already know pilates/yoga in order to be able to attempt these exercises."
3,"Looks nice, but tough to assemble","It's a nice-looking aluminum column, which ships in three long sections which ""snap together"". The instructions say ""Assemble the final interlock by rapping with the heel of the hand, starting at one end of the column"". (Fig. 3). Unless you have hands like The Hulk, this is sheer fantasy. Getting all three sections locked is very hard. I'm taking a break from trying; my hands hurt too much. I'm holding it together with belts until I can get a strap wrench onto the thing. This is not fun.With the right tools, or about three big guys to squeeze along the length of the column, this is probably an easy job."
5,"A charming holiday-themed, full color picture book","Firefighter's Night Before Christmas is a charming holiday-themed, full color picture book story, told in rhyming verse by Kimbra Cutlip (and enhanced with the artwork of James Rice), about a firefighting team who are called away to handle a blaze just moments before a familiar Christmas holiday visitor slips down their chimney and leaves some very special surprises. Firefighter's Night Before Christmas is recommended for any family, school or community library Christmas bookshelf as being a heartwarming and entertaining story celebrating the courage of brave people who serve the public, as well as the manifold joys of the Christmas season."
4,Nothing is perfect,"This is one of the best and most versatile Chorus Pedals i've ever tried. You can go from a warm and clean chorus like Eric Johnson's (well... almost... no one like him and his sound) to a hot and dinamic sound like Kurt Cobain's on Come as you Are just by activating the DEPTH switch. Its controls are very simple... just the ON/OFF button, The RATE control and the DEPTH Switch, but... trust me... you can do a lot of things with this pedal and a nice tube amp"
4,Gentle yet Rushing Sounds of Smashing Pumpkins and Dinosaur Jr.,"I have used this pedal for quite some time. Its a fairly simple phaser pedal with one knob and one switch. You get a really great range of phase though. Listen to ""Plume"" by Smashing Pumpkins to hear it in action on the solo part. I also believe its the phaser used on the Dinosaur Jr song ""Freak Scene""WOOOOOSH!"
1,Great show bad DVD,The quality of this DVD is shocking.Even the titles are Blurred.I tried everything but it's just a poor copy. It's a shame because the concert (what I can see of it)is great.
2,Poor Quality,"The content was good, however the quality of the video was poor. Although recorded live, the sharpness, sound quality and the recording in general could have been much better.The Leningrad Cowboys have better video on You Tube."
2,Not that great of a taste,You need to add plenty of stuff to make this Pesto sauce taste any good. I would suggest you just get real basil and make your own.
2,Very disappointing,"Waited a long time for this book. Not even up to the standard of Mythion Improbable, which I thought was a decent, lightish story in the MYTH series tradition. However, this book was a complete let down. No character development, very little plot development, and a jarring ""let's-wrap-up-this-series-as-fast-as-possible"" ending. Oh well..David"
2,Sweet MYTH-tery of Life part 2,It was the book prior told from another view point that gave close to the previous books cliffhanger ending. Weak. The series that went out with a whimper.
2,Very disappointing,I bought this CD intending to play it as my guests arrived at my home. I imagined soothing angelic harp music wafting amongst the flowers and good wishes just before my husband and I renewed our wedding vows. I never did play this CD. The music was neither peaceful nor inspiring. The songs plodded along like a tired donkey. The only thing plucked was my nerves! What a shame!
2,Not too bad,"Almost 3 stars. Worth its purchase price.It shows the original poem (as it was written by him) on one page, then the typed one on the next. There were a few words that needed translation.I enjoyed many of his poems, they were pretty good. I didn't care for the use of numbers as letters though. No doubt this book will be enjoyed by many in years to come."
5,Very touching,"This book displays the sensitive and deep side of Tupac Shakur, the controversial rapper. God bless his soul... He embraced our lives with only 25 years, i would like to take this opportunity to talk about this book. I advise every single deep thinker in this world to buy this book.. It's very inspiring, especially coming out from tupac... The book title reflects Tupac's life, for he was indeed , a rose that grew from concrete."
5,Tupac's poems wee touching.,"I loved Tupac's book, because they were inspiring. My favorite on was ""I Cry"", because I could really relate to his poem and what he ws trying to say. So I give the book a % stars."
5,Tupac's poem book is a classic and a must for Tupac lovers,This book is a classic poem book sorta like shakspere but better this is a must for a tupac lover it is such good book. It is evry thing you think it would be and so much more. Tupac is the the 90's voice on life
5,ONE OF THE BEST,THIS BOOK SHOWS TUPAC'S MORE SENSITIVE SIDE!!! THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANY TUPAC FAN AND FOR ANYBODY ELSE WHO THOUGHT HE WAS JUST ANOTHER RAPPER MAKING WOMEN LOOK BAD. IN THIS BOOK HE JUST SPEAKS ABOUT REAL SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND REAL FEELINGS COMMON PEOPLE IDENTIFY WITH. IT'S TUPAC'S REAL SIDE...
1,Tom's gotten stale,First it wasn't obvious it was a comic book and my Kindle wouldn't view it in landscape which made it useless. How to Master the Art of Selling changed my life 20+ years ago and for that I'm grateful to Tom.Since then I've been less than impressed with his efforts.
5,THE BEST INVESTMENT ANYONE CAN DO,"I started my own Real State Busines in 1,992 and read this book in 1,996 for the first time. Now I have 19 employes and make 10 times more money than before. My busines still growing.In my name and all family member's: Thank you Mr. Hopkins, your work have made a big difference for us. You still are the only one and really proffesional ""Sales Trainer"". The rest are just ""Motivators"".With my best wishes for you and everyone around you,"
1,Super slow shipping and no tracking,"I ordered this college textbook in the hopes that it would arrive by the start of the Fall Semester (about 10 days before). The seller gave a wide range in their estimate of when it would be delivered Aug 18th through September 2nd. The semester started on Aug 23rd. I don't recall reading in the ad that the book would be shipped in such a way that it cannot be tracked. I have contacted the seller and they tell me that they use DHL but don't use tracking numbers. Although they replied quickly, in their reply they told me that they could do nothing for me. I ordered other college textbooks from other sellers. They all arrived on time and most of them used the US Post Office tracking. I think this seller should announce this fact (that they don't use tracking) in all of their ads. I will not use them again."
1,Sucks,"Don't waste your time. Bad voice over and pathetic ""history"" of Selena by clueless teenage girls. A waste of money."
5,Dune on a smaller scale,"I can't think of a more terrifying world than Pandora, Herbert's world of weird and deadly animals and mutant clones, all created at the whim of Ship, the accidental god-machine from his novel Destination:Void. Again, Herbert places his poor charaters in a constant and dire struggle for survival, only this time it's not just humans who want to stay alive. The whole drama plays out under the watch of the sometimes benevolant, sometimes indifferent, but always inscrutable Ship, who has become man's (and clone's) computer-God of his own creation.What foresight Herbert had to present such a world of biological science and ecological destruction gone mad that foreshadows our own time.A real treat for wild sci-fi fans. Look for it in used book stores. It's worth it!"
4,Not his best but...,"This is not Frank Herbert at his best (I don't think any of his collaborations with other authors work as well as his solo work) but, having said that, it still stands as a great read. Herbert was one of the masters of Science Fiction and, as successful and wonderful as the Dune series is, people should read wider. All of his novels are worth searching out."
3,don't read the last chapter,"I really love this book. Except the last chapter. Ruins a perfectly good book for absolutely no reason except maybe for the author to inject some ""realism"" into it or to get in a personal fantasy. My advice, rip the last chapter off and enjoy a good read."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I was excited to get this book and as I started reading it, I was tempted to start sending free copies to my friends. That was very premature and I'm glad I didn't.From the writing standpoint, the characters are very interesting and moderately well developed. It's a great story. The problem? The ending. When I read the last chapter I was seriously tempted to throw the book across the room. It's the first time I recall being actually pissed off at the way a book ended.Beyond that, I would also warn that the fight sequences are UN-ENDING. They go on forever. I wound up just skimming and skimming, especially towards the end of the book. I mean really... how many (and how long) sword/fight sequences can you read?This was a great book in concept. And it should have been a great book in excecution. But the ending was horrible.Don't waste your time spending hours reading this just so you can get to the end and hate that you did it."
4,"Fun, But Not Everything It Could Be","This is a fun and unusual story. There is; however, a strange sense of dislocation in time as part of the novel takes place at The World Trade Center.The book was written when the author was nineteen years old, and I think that shows. Having said that, the story remains entertaining, and I intend to buy and read the much more recent sequel, Elegy Beach.A road trip set in a post-apocalyptic world that includes such things as unicorns and griffons. S.M Stirling (allegedly a fan) later told this kind of story much more successfully and with more skill.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
5,Characters that live and breathe,"I first read Ariel as a junior or senior in high school (back in 1986 or 1987), when it was given to me as part of a bag full of used books. I have re-read the book through college, graduate school and my working life and still love it. I have loaned it to friends and relatives, all of whom enjoyed it - many of whom loved it as much as I do.It is a touching coming of age story and a wonderful adventure story. The best part of the book, I think, is that the characters feel like real people - it is impossible not to care about them. I'm not easily moved by books, but Ariel affects me every time I read it.I, too, have to wonder why this book is out of print!"
5,Not a Fantasy Fan But This Was Great,"I have to say that I hate fantasy. Hate it, hate it, hate it. Haven't even read any Tolkien because, well, I hate fantasy.That said, I sat down and started reading this because a friend told me this was the book for someone who hates fantasy, but would like a good read. And he was right. The book grabbed me from the start, and held my attention all the way to the end. While I wasn't too happy with the ending, it was consistent and correct for the book.Go ahead. Buy it and read it."
5,real ariel book,"The original book, came in good condition, great book to read, book is fantasy, apocalypse the world stops no cars move time stops creatures only thought of appear like unicorns and griffons great book kept me wanting to read it, one of the only books I really enjoyed and have never forgot."
3,artsy,Artsy movie which gets engaging but at the end leaves you a little hanging. I admire W.A. - he's great and I like his work but I'm not giving this 5* to recommend others to buy it.
1,Sophomoric,"Unbelievable soap opera which Allen tries to elevate to high tragedy. The film sinks under the weight of some trite philosophizing, and all-too obvious symbolism: the morally disturbed hero is an optometrist! Ooh, get it? And there is a rabbi who goes ever so symbolically blind. Ah-hah! God is blind! Ho-hum. There is not a single living character in this stupid self-indulgent flick. They are all selfish bores, and that Woody Allen takes them and their empty stupidity seriously is the most tragic thing about this bomb of a movie."
2,a bit small,its looks exactly like the photo but smaller...didnt know that it was going to be this small... its the size of an adults hand..(maybe even smaller)
3,INTENSE LOVE STORY YET CRUEL,"I read the book looking for something different. It wasn't what I expected. The book describe a beautiful love story, the kind of love we all hope for, although she found it in another female (not my alternative)still it was deep and unique. I guess it doesn't matter as long as you are happy and in love. At the same time it describes a horror story. The contrast, impact of one with the other never matches. It is like oil and vinegar, like heaven and hell, hard to describe. It was good and not good. I did and did not like it. It could have been a beautiful love story, period. It was very real, the kind of realism some of us don't want to know about."
3,"Mediocre, 2 and a half starts","It was a good idea but the actual movie was not that great. For instance, the poachers tried to capture her, she did not seem to try to get away. The acting was not that good, but the story was good."
5,Most important Philosophy of Science work of the decade.,"Kary Mullis captures today's science world as no one else could. While the lay audience will probably enjoy this work as a good read, the scientific community should take special interest in that Mullis has written a book that should cause them to remember why they became scientists in the first place. If I am ever required to teach a Philosophy of Science course at either the undergraduate or graduate school level, this book will certainly be required reading. In my opinion, this might be the most important treatise on the philosophy of science and the scientific method since the writings of Karl Popper several decades ago."
1,Worst book I've read in ages.,"It's completely wretched. It doesn't contain any interesting science, the 'alternative' stuff is pointless, the political views are mis-informed and self-contradicting, the writing gets progessively poorer to where the latter part of the book is hard to read, and I can't imagine that it would be any fun talking to the guy - he seems loud and boring.I did draw one thing interesting from the book: There's no reason to assume that Nobel Prize winners are other than discovers of something that turned out to be really useful. Which leaves me a little disappointed."
2,Rambling of a Nobel prize winner,"If it wasn't for a couple of hilarious anecdotes including the encounter with Swedish king and surfing episode after he got the Nobel prize, this would have been a very boring book with a title ""Rambling of a rummie with a PhD"". Mullis is eager to share his opinion on almost anythng and he should stick to surfing and molecular biology as he is not doing too good with almost anything else. He should have hired a decent ghostwriter as his writing is still ""work in progress"". And it was so easy to notice that his effort dwindled down in last couple of ""chapters"" that it became pathetic at times. Better luck with his next book, but I am definitely not going to read it."
1,Only a couple of chapters in...,"I've only read the first couple of chapters so far, but I find the writing style extremely irritating - I'll read the rest of the book, but I'm dreading what I'll find when (as I've read in these reviews) the writing deteriorates in the later chapters...It strikes me that Mullis is trying to be Richard Feynman, but failing miserably. The same ingredients are there (drumming/surfing, meeting important people and talking about unlikely topics, womanizing, getting into science as a kid, etc.), but whereas they make Feynman seem more human, Mullis comes off as self-centred and arrogant."
2,Surely you're joking,"Very lightweight. There are three proto-books in here: 1) A scientific autobiography a la Feynman. These parts are OK, although they tend to support the thesis that physicists are wittier if not smarter than chemists. Mullins has no self-esteem problems.2) Some adventures in druggy/new-agey states of consciousness (astral projection, etc). These episodes are at least cleanly reported, but the implications are not explored from any particularly new perspective, so why bother?3) An attack on certain big-science viewpoints, in particular the HIV theory of AIDS causation. Mullins advances some interesting views. His accusation that the HIV theory came about because a lot of virus scientists were looking for work is alarming, and somewhat believable. But to make such serious accusation in an offhand manner, interspersed with his other random thoughts, is highly irresponsible.In short, not worth the money. It's a quick read so you won't waste too much time, and it is entertaining."
4,Fun the first time for a 12-month old,"My son liked this at my older daughter's friend's house, but since he got it for his 1st bday (he has an obsession with balls), he hasn't played with it much.....it is hard to inflate and then plug without loosing too much air. That being said, when it isn't inflated to full capacity it allows him to grab it and crawl with it and allows him to hold onto to it better."
1,Waste of Film,"This movie was total waste of time, effort and money.It was dull, gross and full of pathetic characters.There is nothing entertaining about this film."
2,Poor movie,I thought the movie was poorly done and the story line was just alright. The language was bad and all of the provanity was unnecessary.
1,Try again...,Did nothing for me. Her role or anyone's role in the movie. I can't think of a redeming moment for the entire movie though I watched all of it...
5,Excellent album,"I picked this up not knowing what to expect, but it was in the punk section and that was my mood. Anyway, what a great collection! Excellent production with great bands doing great songs, not a loser in the bunch. It's still not old to me after almost 10 years."
2,"waste of money, going to return it","i bought this at a used store for only 13 dollars, but i'm considering returning it because it's pretty useless. the audio cd's are boring as heck to listen to, and the first 3 are like utter basics for someone who has no idea about italian. i really want something that has some listening activities for a beginner that are full sentences and not just words and phrases. the cd roms are boring and stupid. it came with a lonely planet phrase book too. which puts anglicized pronunciation guides next to each word which i detest."
3,THIS MOVIE IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY,I FEEL THAT THIS MOVIE IS AVERAGE. IT DOES START OFF SLOW BUT IT GETS GOOD AND ONCE YOU REALLY GET INTO THE MOVIE YOU ARE DISAPOINTED WITH THE ENDING. OVERALL I GIVE IT 3***.
2,Not as good as old recipe,"New recipe just not as good. They brag about more chocolate, but the filling just doesn't have the same flavor."
5,Great CD!,"This is an excellent CD! I am always looking for new original music and I found Matt Taylor through a search on the web. I plan on ordering his other 2 CD's off of his web site (www.matttaylor.biz). I consider Matt Taylor's sound somewhat of a modern folk sound, similar to the likes of Dave Matthews or John Mayer, but with less pop. I highly recommend this CD for anyone looking for great original music."
2,Big disappointment,"I was so excited when this book came, but after trying my first 3 exercises from this book, I was very disappointed. The authors take for granted that the reader must be a well rounded Photoshop user. I am familiar with the Photoshop basics and have been for some time, but while following their instructions, none of my results resembled those in the book.If you are a beginner in Photoshop, I strongly recommend skipping this one."
1,Do not understand the high ratings,"Because of the high ratings and glowing reviews, I watched this on Netfilx. So, so glad I did not buy it. I found it to be boring, and kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I have watched thousands of movies and loved so many of them, but this was not one of them."
3,Gore-tastic,"Not the best fidelity, but a whole lot of fun. Banjo music, weird trailers, and the sounds of gore. I got mine signed by the man himself, but even without an autograph you get a dose of the godfather's personality through his detailed liner notes.Check out a short interview with Mr. Lewis in The MAD DOG MOVIES Podcast episode 7!"
1,Misinformation,"Ezzo is pastor with no medical experience who wrote books touting his theories on raising children, which included rigorous guidelines about Parent Directed Feeding of infants. Now, Gary Ezzo's system and his books (including the popular ""On Becoming Babywise"") which were once the materials of choice for church-based parenting classes across the country, are being condemned by the medical community and other parenting experts for their dangerous practices. They have led to dehydration and poor weight gain. His proposed strict schedules go against the feeding recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and interfere with the natural milk production of lactating women."
1,Not so good,Ezzo is not trained in childrearing and there have been numerous reports of children becoming sick due to dehydration as a result of their parents using his methods...personally I think his methods are cruel and inhumane!
1,DANGER !!! Burn this book !!!,"Warning to all parents out there ! This book can seriously harm the physical and psychological health of your baby ! Listen to the American Association of Pediatrics rather than the Ezzo's who have no real qualifications ! This book has been strongly condemned by all scientific groups who have reviewed it (except, of course, for the Ezzo's own ""in-house"" pediatricians). Don't just take my word for this, search the web for numerous other articles that criticize this approach ! Above all, DO NOT USE THIS APPROACH ON YOUR BABY !!!"
1,Baby NOT SO WISE can harm your child,"Studies have shown that babywise babies are often ""fail to thrive"" babies who do not gain weight and can have life threatening dehydration. If you love your baby do not read this book. Babies are not minature adults that need discipline but tiny bundles that need loving not rules."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book is an excellent resource for parenting. The poor reviews I have read on this site make it evident that those people never read the book. The references to child abuse in other reviews are ABSURD!This book emphasises fostering a loving relationship with your child, and encourages parents to use the same teachings that Jesus offered us: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" This method teaches children to think about their actions and how they will affect others around them. It in no way implies that your child should be trained like a pet.Please don't listen to the extremists who negatively criticise this book. They clearly never read it."
1,My heart breaks for any child whose parent follows this.,"Sure, you want your child to behave. But this book suggests extreme, cruel methods. There are hundreds of better parenting books out there. Do yourself a favor and do more research before you follow this advice."
1,don't buy this book,"Christianity Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr Jay Gordon and many others havedenouced this book and the authors methods as being dangerous. Babies who are breastfedon the scheduele included in the book, have suffered dehydration, failure to thrive, and severecomplications. Parents using this method have been convicted of child abuse!Please do not buy this book. Try The Baby book by Dr. Sears or You Baby and child byPenelope Leach instead."
4,"Good book, good series","This is a good follow-up to the first book. It's important that you have the first book, as this one references it rather than repeating the information. Everyone comments on how great my child behaves and that she's happy all the time. I attribute that to the techniques I learned in these books. I didn't follow them to the letter, but I did follow the main principles and adjusted to the individual needs of my child. I highly recommend this book (and the first one)."
1,Unqualified,Don't waste your money. This book provides little insight into looking after your baby. The authors are not qualified and use almost no references.
1,Thought it was great and then realized it was not!,Do your research and see why so many people realized BabyWise is a NOT WISE choice for your child or family.
3,Good build on the 1st in the series,"This product gives some good guidance following the first book in the series, but it is not as detailed on how to structure nap times or to transition to a new routine. You still have to refer to the first book, which I would give 5 stars. This one was not great, but I'm glad I got it just to give me the confidence that I was doing everything ""right""."
1,Here's another example of how the USA hates children.,"Here's a quick formulaic approach to detach from one's children and turn them into mistrustful, pliant, hostile little drones. Basically a hateful religious/demagogic rehashing of the old ""children should be seen, not heard"" outlook with generous dollops (or should I say ""wallops""?) of ""spare the rod, spoil the child"" and ""might makes right"". Obviously written by somebody with zero experience outside his own narrow, pseudo-theological ken, it goes against every lesson accrued via observation, research and trial-and-error over most of the 1900s. Parents & guardians using this compendium of abuse deserve what they get - sadly, society will have to deal with the results."
1,Not too helpful,I was hoping to get more info about feeding schedules for my 10 month old as far as when to feed in relation to nap times. This book has information about feeding and has some helpful tips but not what I expected.
1,How to turn your child into a well-behaved pet,"The parents who rave about this ""method"" of child-rearing are obviously more interested in having their children perform, behave, and, ultimately, FEEL like pets rather than cherished and unique individuals. I was shocked, dismayed, and ultimately sickened by the things this book advocates.To those who say, ""It works!"" I say, ""Probably. But at what cost to your child in later life?"" The reason it works is because by ignoring a child's valid and real needs you crush their spirit, until they become so certain that no one will answer them that they simply give up and stop trying, often to the point of Failure to Thrive Syndrome.There are excellent reasons that the American Academy of Pediatrics, La Leche Leauge, and the American Medical Association (among others) have condemned this book and its ""methods"".If you love your children, if you want them to thrive and not just ""obey"" like little robots, please don't follow the ""advice"" in this book."
1,This man is out of his mind!,"Seriously, he has no credentials, none. And a five month old is a pre-toddler? Where does he come up with this stuff!! Oh and don't let your newborn ""manipulate"" you and trick you into nurturing him! Why read a book laced with inaccuracies by a man that has no credentials, no studies, nothing to back up what he says. Oh except all the raving mom's that claim success. What is success? Your baby no longer cries at night, because your 4 week old has learned that you would rather let him throw up in his bed from crying so hard than come comfort him. Hey I bet your husband won't ask for sex anymore if you tell him no every night! Sounds like a great relationship! Wonderful logic!How about reading a book by a PEDIATRICIAN who has EIGHT children?? No, that would be silly. Buy a book that has warnings from the AAP against it. Sounds smart...uggghhOh and give it to all the new moms you know!"
4,I have not finished reading the book but so far so good.,"The only negative thing I have to say about this order is that it took way longer than I expected to arrive. And when I tried to email the shipper for some info, I never got a response. But I eventually got the book."
1,a better rating is no star,it's good to know that this book is out of print and difficult to obtain here on amazon. there's nothing helpful or enriching written in this book that will help you in raising your child. what a shame for anyone to own this book!
1,MORE CHILD ABUSE 2,"Please don't use this book! I just don't believe this stuff! I have a 14 month old baby and he still wakes up occasionally in the night. Not a problem. I hold him or nurse him until he goes back to sleep. I knew coming in that parenting takes some work and maybe a little sacrifice. I comfort my child when he cries. I hold him when possible, or talk gently to him. I have never hit or isolated him. When he does something I don't want him to, I stop him. I say ""no"" and move him away. As often as it takes. Distracting helps, too. We have childproofed many items to reduce battles, because he is too little. He is just now starting to understand a bit that there are things he isn't supposed to do, and we are working with him. I dread to think what children raised in accordance with this book and its predecessor will turn out to be. Cold-blooded, and either very mean or very sad and victimized. Definitely no self-esteem."
5,Triplets Sleeping Through The Night!,"This program works! I have 5-month old triplets, they've been sleeping through the night for over a month now! Technically, they're only 3 months old (adjusted age - they were 2 months premature); I had to readjust the program slightly due to their size/weight, etc. Plain and simple it works."
1,Don't buy it,"Ezzo's philosophy is harmful to babies. If you are looking for a parenting book, try the DR. Sears Baby Book."
1,EZZO.INFO please research before buying,www.ezzo.infoPlease read the info here before buying any books by this author. He has no qualifications in child development to be writing anything. His books are full of medical inaccuracies. Many children have been harmed with his book's methods. The AAP has warned against them. PARENTS BEWARE!!!
4,Helpful,"I recieved the original ""On Becoming BabyWise"" as a gift soon after my son was born and it was a life-saver! It helped me correct my son's schedule (he had his days and nights totally switched) and had him sleeping through the night by 10 wks old! Then, at 6 months old, with the introduction of solids into his diet and possibly some teething discomfort, his schedule got very mixed up again and I got very tired!! I bought this book hoping it would be as helpful as the first Babywise and, while it was helpful, it was far from being as good as the original. The scheduling problem I was having was addressed in the early chapters, and now that my son is back to sleeping throught the night, it was probably worth buying book just for those first 50 pages. I definately don't agree with everything Ezzo recommends, but there is some valueable information and some good tips."
2,Not a fan,"I purchased this book as I thought it was appropriate due to my child's age. However, I realized that I should have bought the very first one. I read this anyway. I found it quite hilarious! While I can appreciate that Ezzo perceives that he is accurate, I find that it is assanine that someone truely believes that in order for a baby to sleep better they need to feel that their parent's marriage is secure! I picked and chose the information that I felt was accurate and went from there. I wouldn't recommend this book alone. I would recommend this book in tandem with Sleeping Through the Night, Revised Edition: How Infants, Toddlers, and Their Parents Can Get a Good Night's Sleep by Jodi A. Mindell who takes a scientific approach versus her experience."
5,From a Devoted BabyWise Mom,"My son is almost 6 months old, and responded very well to the BabyWise schedule. He goes down on his own for naps, and wakes up HAPPY 99% of the time. He started sleeping 9 hours at night by week 9. I purchased the second phase of the BabyWise series, and the transition from bottle to baby food is going well. Maybe it doesn't work for all babies, but me and my three cousins all had babies in the same 3 month period, and all are being successfully raised in this method. I would definately recommend getting the second book, since the first one really doesn't cover this transitional stage between infant and toddler."
2,Better off talking with other parents,"I bought Book I and reviewed that as ok. I reviewed that it seemed like it made you feel as a failure if you followed their methods and it didn't work. But, I did also think that there was enough valuable information in it to buy this second book.I read it and have determined that I got better advice from talking to real people. These books just don't support you as a parent if things don't turn out to their mold of what the child should be doing.They introduce sign language signs at the end of the book, but don't suggest how to introduce those signs. There needs to be more on that than just the signs."
1,Lies and Unwise,"This book is dangerous and full of errors relating from a general ignorance of basic human development. If you want your life not to change when you have children, DO NOT have children.Following this third world orphanage model of raising a child is not the answer to sleepless nights and crying babies. All crying eventually stops, either when the babies needs are met, or when the baby gives up hope."
1,"another book for my ""worst parenting books"" list","Ezzo is at it again with advice that I wouldn't apply to my dog, let alone my baby. This book advocates spanking and other harsh punishments for a baby who merely crawls off a blanket placed on the floor for ""blanket time"" playing. I could go on and on about the insanity of this advice.... I defer instead to gentler books by Dr. William Sears and Marths Sears R.N., such as ""The Baby Book"" and ""The Discipline Book"". If you still think you'd be interested in this book I urge you to browse a copy before spending the money, so you can decide for yourself what you think."
2,"Story was Ok; buy ""First You Have to Row a Little Boat"" instead","A much better book by this author is ""First You Have to Row a Little Boat""; it is clear Richard Bode reworked ""Blue Sloop at Dawn"" some years later to become ""First You Have to Row a Little Boat"" and that rewrite created a marvelous motivational book. This book is an interesting study to see how this author's style changed over those years. Be careful when buying this book used; mine was described as ""very good"", but the condition was ""fair"" at best."
1,Useless,Bought this at bed bath & Beyond but it got rusted after a week because there is no drain to it. It looks disgusting and it is going to the trash can.
3,Uplifting the typical,"3 1/2The album looses a little steam about halfway through, opting for a slower section which the band doesn't dazzle with quite as much as a first side of upbeat numbers, but altogether this is a good example of how a few modifications to a tried and true indie-pop format can breathe urgency back into the compositions."
5,"Kreg's 4 1/2"" Resaw Guide",A quality product as usual from Kreg. I also have the larger version and am pleased with both.
1,Used,This item came to me used and broken. I was highly unsatisfied with it. I Could not understand how something like that was even sent out. How-ever the passenger side mirror came new and I was pleased with it.
3,Only an OK cover,"Got this cover to keep bird droppings off my car. Tha it does but it lets all kinds of dirt thru. Also, the cover has started to tear at the gromet mounts. Not very durable."
2,Not Durable- Disintegrated after a couple months,"Cover is fine- a little on the cheap side. I live in So. Cal so not much weather to deal with, don't know if this would hold up to anything serious. Happily that's not a problem here in paradise! Cover is pretty small, but so is my car (Toyota MR2). Good fit for a two seater, if your car is any bigger you'll want a bigger cover than this.UPDATE: Pretty much disintegrated after a couple months. Giving 2 stars because it was cheap and I did take it on and off my car frequently. If you'll be leaving it on for long stretches it's probably ok, will last a bit longer. Just do't get too attached to it."
3,The BUSINESS END of Storyboarding,"This really isn't a crash course in Storyboarding as much as it's a crash course in how the author got a job Storyboarding.The information on the art of creating storyboards is rather small. ""Teach yourself to draw... Keep practicing.""If you're an artist looking to break into the business of being a professional storyboarder than this book might be for you. If you're looking to learn HOW to storyboard, look elsewhere."
2,"Some good information, but...","This book had some good information, but focused more on career building and Hollywood networking than on actual storyboarding techniques. I'm glad the author was able to develop such a career, but he goes on too much about it and I think the book would have been more useful with more detail on translating script and director's vision into storyboards rather than stories on how lucky the guy was getting to be a director's assistant."
1,Not What You Think - horrible instruction book,"This book is misleading from cover to cover. It is not a tutorial or ""course"" as the title may mis-lead you to believe. It is a personal account of finding a job in Hollywood after leaving film school without a plan. This book does not even discuss the basic nomenclature of the storyboard artist, much less present insights or examples into actual storyboards from sequences in films with which you may be familiar. Have I mentioned that the book title and editor's summary is misleading. Pass on this and find something actually helpful in learning how to prepare storyboards like ""Understanding Comics"" or ""Storyboards: Motion in Art""."
1,Connie Mason could do much better,"I am a very devoted fan of Connie Mason's and could not believe that any book of hers could be written so badly. I was very surprised that it was so bad. This is not a book that I would recommend to anyone. The hero rapes the heroine when their marriage is consummated. I was at a lost then. Never has the hero, in any book of hers, done that before. It was not appealing and the book just went down hill from there.However, Connie Mason is a very good writter and story teller, so if anyone wants to read a delightful Connie Mason book try The Laird of Stonehaven, Lionheart, Pirate, Pure Temptation, A Taste of Paradise or The Lion's Bride."
4,Good pots boiling,"This work is an edited anthology, and as a `potboiler' as they would call it in London, I neither expected to read it through or to particularly enjoy it. I did both - more, it was a wonderful source for further reading, new authors and books I had not found before. I came away from my reading very satisfied to have found this work and even determined that I should reread Boswell and Johnson on London..There was a clue that this might be a rare exception to a normal potboiler - a book only for dipping into - in the book's blurbs was one from Dirk Bogarde, in his author and critic mode, of titivating and admiring sentences, and another from Peter Ackroyd.I shall look out for this author's other works and I recommend this one."
2,Quelle deception! [What a disappointment!],"This author must think all Americans have nothing better to do but read the gossip columns or watch soap operas and want the French vocabulary to go with such behaviors. A major portion of this book covers romance-horoscopes and other vapid matters. The author insults my intelligence with her choice of topics. In addition, Ms. Heminway uses vocabulary in her pieces not defined in the book's glossary or pages of text which further frustrates the reader. A wonderfully, unusable text!"
3,Fast delivery BUT 30 sheets had creases in one corner,"Fast delivery BUT 30 sheets had creases in one corner. Some of the 30 sheets were really folded, which means some of the business cards I will print will have creases & folds."
5,Avery cards,"These are the best brand of print your own cards, perfect edges and they look professional."
1,"""guaranteed"" to work in any inkjet printer? yeah right.","What they really mean is guaranteed that it might work but you have to pay extra to call the tech support #. Some guarantee. The printed cards did not align correctly despite using the correct MSWord template. They recommend their own software which cannot type other languages as Word can. Why should I pay the extra money to call tech support for something ""guaranteed"" to work? I'm not, I'm just going to return them and buy another brand."
4,What I wanted,"This is the product I wanted I found the best price at this vendor, but I still think it was too high a price."
2,Damaged Goods,Cards came bent and do not work in the printer. Plus it took 21 days to get to me. I would never recommend this. Waste of money! Had to go buy new ones!
1,Complete Garbage.,"None of the templates for the 8371 business cards actually print correctly. You would never notice this unless you have a very nice business card, with bleed borders or custom graphics. However, if you are trying to apply for a job that isn't run out of your mom's garage, you need something better. After messing with these garbage files for more than an hour, I finally managed to get half a sheet of useable cards. I am NEVER NEVER *NEVER* buying avery again. EVER."
2,Great product,"When Avery says clean edge- they mean it. The best I've used so far. Easy to separate and no residual pieces of ""hanging chads"". 5 Stars!"
5,Excellent,"There isn't too much to say about these cards except that they are great! The do tear neatly, print well and and simple to use. 5 star product."
4,Anne of Green Gables,If you like to read about a person who hopes and dreams and has romance then you will like this book called Anne of Geen Gables it full of hopes and dreams I know because I have read it Its about a little girl getting adopted by a brother and sister and falls in love with a boy that she grew up with
4,Cute story!,Anne of Green Gables is such a cute story. I loved her spunky personaility and endearing character. Cannot wait to see the DVD series. The book is written with such description that you can imagine sitting on the bridge overlooking the stream and watching Anne's life unfold. The story truly made me smile.
2,DEEPLY FLAWED,"There were a number of technical errors in this book, but it was easily twice as good as the sequel, ""Killer Elite,"" so I gave it twice as many stars! The ""quick kill"" chart for use of the blade was fairly accurate, although the effectiveness of these moves was a tad overrated, and the correct details as to how to make these moves more effective were not disclosed (presumably because Bradley does not know them). The garrotte was overrated as a weapon, and its shortcomings (of which there are many) were barely touched upon. This book does offer a number of illustrations as to the ""best ways"" to snap a man's neck (from behind, when he's not expecting it), although there is absolutely no safe way to practice these moves. Amusing, but far from accurate in many aspects. I gave my copy away."
1,Yuck!,"This stuff was really bad. I bought it because it was cheaper and a new product for me. Vegetarians are always looking for something new and unique. This is not good. Go with the Hains products. Much better there , even if they don`t have turkey flavor. Yuck! I`d give this gravy 0 stars if I could........"
3,Good tape for Beginners.,I found using ankle weights for everything (except the abs workout) helps to make it a bit more challenging.
3,Good for begginers,"This DVD is good in that it breaks down targeted muscle groups into 10 minute segments for those that simply don't have the time to do a full workout, or you can put it all together for an effective total body workout. As an instructor she demontstates the moves well and with just a little practice you should be able to follow along with no problems. I wish she could be just a little more interesting and less repetitive with her dialog. I gave this 3 stars because I think it does have a good layout with the 10 minute intervals and it is easy to follow however it may be a bit boring for the more advanced fitness buffs."
4,"As an exercise novice and non-enthusiast, I like it.","I've only tried the arms workout so far. I'm taking it slowly because I have never been motivated to stick with a weight routine before and I'd like to change that.This workout is good for me simply because it's 10 minutes so I don't have the excuse of ""no time,"" and it requires only hand weights. I don't know if the routine is significiant enough to make an impact on my health but at least I'm finally motivated to do strength training on a regular basis.My only complaint is that the instructor doesn't count the reps out loud, so I have to look at the screen to keep in synch with her which is hard when I'm face down on the floor."
4,Great everyday cologne,I have been wearing this cologne for 3 years now but just bought it on amazon for the first time. It cost half what it does at the luxury retailer I used to buy it from. Its light and fragrant. Its a great everyday cologne if you like a cologne that just hints of what you smell like
1,Undeclared Ingredient: Fragrance!,"This was stated as a 'fragrance-free' but has undeclared fragrance! ""Lightly scented"" is printed on the bottle & added as the last ingredient on the list on the bottle! For those of us with severe, disabling allergies & chemical reactions when exposed to these substances the ADA has now listed this as a disability. Magick Botanicals have some good products, but for those of us who cannot natural or chemical/man-made fragrances it is life threatening."
5,I love this stuff!,"I used to have lots of thick hair, but now in my 60s, it's thinning out on top, and since I've gone gray, that old pink scalp shows through on top just like an old lady's. Well, I guess that's what I am. But this stuff does a nice job, and I use it along with the shampoo for thinning hair. I can really tell the difference. I just have to be careful to get the fragrance free, because they also carry a scented one. Ugh!"
1,DOESN'T WORK,"IT SAYS IT HAS 800 BLOCKS OF MEMORY BUT I CAN ONLY SAVE 1 SEASON OF NFL2K1 ON IT. DON'T BUY IT, I OWN 2 AND BOTH DO THE SAME THING."
2,BAD MEM CARD,I personaly own this mem card and it turned out to be a bad investment. Sure it is good for like jet grind radio and chu chu rocket for saving pics but other than that is worthless. If the switch is in wrong place files become corrupted if card is accidenally dropped files become corrupted I have personally lost 3 pso characters to this card one at 96 one at 28 and one at 14. And that is another thing be careful which games you select to use this card with.
1,"Great price, Bad card!",The card saved on all 4 pages(200 blocks each)for the first month I had it but now it will only act as a normal 200 block memory card.It's a simple as 1 2 3 .Dont buy this product.
1,Warning - Cheaper is not always better,"When I bought this card, I was so happy that it could store 800 blocks for such a low price. When I got it, the fourth slot didn't even work, so I only had 600 blocks. Then a few months later, when I tried to open a file from a different slot, it said the the card was corrupted and I had to reset it. In my experience cards made by Performance (InterAct) are VERY unsafe; don't let the price fool you into buying one. Especially beware those who use multi-slotted cards to keep a lot of Phantasy Star characters, these CAN NOT be backed up and you will lose them forever.I had to learn my lesson the hard way, don't be next!"
2,Vastly overrated,"Ok, I'll be honest. This is a decent set of 2.0 speakers (no subwoofer), and would be a good buy if they sold for $29.95 (or even $49.95). But they don't. And that's the problem.For $100 there are MUCH better products on the market. (I've done A/B comparisons with most of them, so I'm not just blowing smoke). Yes, most of them are 2.1 systems and come with a subwoofer. But a decent 2.1 system is no harder to set up than these speakers, and the sub - which just sits on the floor under the computer desk - is a non-issue.There are plenty of people who are happy to pay what Bose is asking for these speakers, and will never realize they're paying $50 just for the Bose brand. (Which is pretty funny because when you talk to REAL audiophiles, the Bose brand stands for overpriced products, lots of hype, tons of marketing money, and mediocre audio quality - across the board)."
2,If you like gospel music,"I had heard the Ivy League's 3 biggest hits, which I liked very much (and still do). And I got the impression that Ivy League was something in the neighbourhood of merseybeat era Beatles or the Hollies. But it really isn't. When you take a closer listen to this you'll notice that most of the music actually sounds more like gospel music with lots of choirs and a very ""old"" sound. Not what I had in mind.I know some of you might think it's unfair of me to give just 2 stars. Ivy League isn't necessarily a bad group, just because they don't fit my personal taste in music. But be aware that this is not really a 60's POP band if that's what you're after. Their 3 biggest hits just happen to sound that way."
2,Good Effort But.......,"I have been studying Pilates with a certified instructor from New York City. My teacher was trained under Romana, and I have always heard legendary tales about this wonderful woman. That's why I bought this video set.I was kind of disappointed. The video was supposed to feature Romana, and it does in a way, but the videos don't have Romana teaching very much. Some of the archival footage of Romana is terrific, but when they place the name of exercises on the entire screen, which is very distracting.It's strange, too, because the woman who does the voice instruction might as well have been an aerobics instructor. It doesn't sound like the voice cues that my teacher gives me. From the voice instruction I heard, it could have been done by nearly anyone. I don't think this person was a Pilates instructor.I am sure that good intentions went into making this video, but I would recommend others."
3,I expected it to be better,"I have read almost all of Erica Jong's earlier books, & I was looking forward to reading this one. Although in the beginning this novel seemed promising (Sarah's story is very lively & well told) later the book dragged on and on...Jong's central themes (women versus men, spirit versus day to day life) were better explored in her earlier works."
1,Dont buy this,"I really HATED this dvd. I've been practicing yoga for about a year and a half now, and have bought about 20 dvs, mainly power yoga, and vinyhasa flow oriented stuff. This one I got because it was recomended according to my past purchases , but it was a real dissapointment. It's about 4 ""routines"" all like from decades apart (one seems really like an 80's aerobics video)no connection /coherence btw them what so ever, not a decent warm up, nothing worth getting this. The whole point of this one was to supposedly ""creat your own routine"" which in theory sounds great, but this if the routines ACTUALLY worked well together. Also, you can only select 2 sets in a row which means if you want to do more(it has 4 different routines) you have to go back after you're done with those, to the main menu to select another one.If you're into more serious yoga-no matter the type you prefer- I would definitely not recomend this ,.... a waste of money."
3,"Yikes! Not great, but not horrible...","This DVD is certainly not the best yoga DVD that I've used--it seems to be more Pilates than yoga--but it has it's merits. First, the user is able to sample three different types of exercise; yoga, pilates, and tai-chi. The yoga workouts start with sun-salutions or a variation of, the tai-chi starts with slow constrolled movements an then speeds up, and the Pilates starts with slow breathing. I was able to select 1-3 workouts at a time. They vary from 10-20 minutes each.The workouts do not end with any type of relaxation, so it is more exercise than yoga practice, but if you are looking to try something different, this may be the DVD with enough variety to try."
5,Time Sensitive W/O as Only Jari Love Can do it,"2 great time sensitive workouts. Only 30 short minutes. You literally work every muscle in your body from your shoulders to your ankles. Great cues and proper form demonstrated. No fast jerky moves. Some use a step or you don't have to (both ways are demonstrated). I love Jari's workouts, I just couldn't do them because they were too long and I couldn't stay consistent. This is perfect, only 30 min.. No jumping around, it starts with a short warm up with light weights and then total muscle training from start to finish. The abs workout is short (8-min), but you will see results. An overall great workout. This is a full strength training workout not a cardio workout. It does keep your heart rate up, but if you're looking for a cardio workout, this is not for you. Worth every dime."
3,not Jari's best,"This video is a good workout if you are up for the challenge. Jari moves quickly from segment to segment to keep things interesting but I found the actual segments themselves pretty mindless. I also thought that the repetitions were so fast that I didn't think I was doing a full-range of motion exercise. This burns calories but I wonder how much it does for actual strength. It also makes it hard to use anything but light weights.The styling of the video is industrial and not very attractive,. The music is as annoying as ever but Jari's chatter seems to be a bit more than usual.I will use this dvd for a calorie burn when I am short of time but ""slim and lean"" will remain my Jari Love go to workout."
4,workout,i love love love jari....in this video i didn't get what i was hoping to get for the upper body workouts.other than that i'd recommend this video.looking forward to trying the extremely ripped 1000!
2,Terrible,This woman is extremely akward and its like watching a housewife from Orange County or Florida workout. It seems almost like she has no experience doing this. she gives hardly any safety tips. Other than that the workout is pretty typical. Jillian Micheals videos are so much better. dissapointed in this purchase.
2,Will workout to this with the volume off!,"I just received this video and honestly can't stand it. The workout itself is pretty good, not as advanced as I thought it would be. Jari is SO annoying, she is working out in leather pants and as she is working out she says 'whew, I am sweating, I'm not much of a sweater but I know Kristen is' How embarassing for Kristen, the girl who is working out next to her. I found out she is only 45 years old and her face looks 60. She has great arms, but a pot belly, in her leather pants, and no rear end at all. Compared to Karen Voight and Kathy Smith, plus all the Firm videos, this one is way way at the bottom. I wish I would not have gotten it. Don't waste your money, buy Karen Voight or the Firm videos instead. Try the 500 calorie Firm workout. Now that is a great workout!"
4,"Not what I expected, but still awesome","I expected to see the Superbowl in its entirety, but it ended up being highlights of the entire season. While it wasn't what I expected, it was still great. I got a rush watching the the highlights leading up to the Superbowl. What a great season for the Patriots!"
1,this dvd is disappointing,"when i pre-ordered this dvd, i read that it would be the first time that the entire super bowl game would be available on dvd. being that the game itself was amazing, i thought that this would be a great purchase. well the biggest disappointment of the year came when it arrived at my house and all it contains is ""highlights."" its a nice dvd for a hardcore patriots fan, but for someone looking to recapture the greatness of superbowl xxxvi, it is a piece of junk. i hate it"
5,A Truly Outstanding Performance,"This team and this region have waited years to bask in the sun and finally our team is World Champion. The spirit, honor, and pride of New England shined on that day like no other place on earth. We have and are a symbol of the American spirit. An outstanding documentary on a truly exciting team. A must have for any football lover. People said we couldn't do it and we did and that is a great thing. It is a lesson to the doubters, only champions believe and prevail."
5,Super Patriots,"Well what can I say it was the best yes the best moment in Boston Sports History better than Fisk home run in 75 they didnt win the series , Tops Bobby Orr because the Bruins had a 3-0 lead andeven the Celtics back in 86 . The Patriots no one and I mean no predicted what would happen . They were 5-5 hmm sounds like this year too ! They went out and played together and won it all . Gil Santos is the best guy for Pats games . This Video is the best ever ? To Top it off Steve Sabo predicted the Pats would lose badly ! Well woh has the best selling Superbowl video of all time The Pats do ! Were the World Champions !! Say It ST. Louis World Champions ? How bout those Rams ? 5-5 ?"
3,I Still Can't Believe the Pats did it---this video is so-so,"OK you gotta love it because it recaps the amazing season the Pats had BUT they leave a lot of important highlights out. They gloss over parts of the season that were important and the coverage of the Super Bowl is mediocre at best. PLUS the introduction is some ridiculous Lord of the Rings [copy] ""Quest for the Lombardi Trophy."" It's almost comical but I can't laugh when I watch it, it's so bad, skip right over that part. Otherwise, get it for the memories. GO PATS!!! SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!! Now I can die happy."
2,Not The Best DVD,"The best DVD version of Superbowl XXXVI would have been the network video with the radio voices of the Patriots Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti doing the play by play. Unfortunately this was not the case .Having the highlights from the season were great but not to have the entire Superbowl play out at the end was disappointing .The other bonuses were fine but most fans I think would want to watch every heart-wrenching moment from the early Patriot lead to the Rams tying the game late in the 4th, listening to John Madden's ill-advised advice to just kneel on the ball and wait for overtime . This could have been a great DVD but instead it's just an OK one ."
5,Everything I expected,"This costume was everything I expected it to be. My daughter is 19 months and the 1-2 size allowed for me to put a couple of layers of clothing underneath. From the first time I put it on her, she loved it and actually kept the hat on. I would recommend this to anyone who is considering a Raggedy Ann costume for their little one."
1,Piece of junk. Do not waste your money,Purchased this product thinking it was good. Worst mistake. It had engine noise after I installed. Installed a filter. No luck. I was told by the installer to remove it. Engine noise is gone just like the EQ. Pay more for another brand. Not worth the hassle.
5,Pure entertaining writining for an evening or lunch book.,"A good book needs to be serve up for your reading needs to please the mind and pleasure of time. Ms. Neely gives both when a book for pure entertainment is the answer to a good evening of reading or at lunchtime break.Blanche is someone real and down to earth in mind and spirit. Her characther relates to real life and real situations. She is funny and even minded in her thoughts. She is a visual picture in ones mind from the first pages to the last words. This fictional woman is a good read and I am waiting patiencely for the next adventure for this caring, profound and earthly bold domestic"
2,"Crude, with numerous bathroom references","Although the plot and dialogue were okay, I was appalled by numerous references to bathroom activities. The book begins with Blanche sitting on the toilet in a public restroom -- and goes on to describe exactly what she's doing there. (I definitely didn't need to know that.) There are other such references in the book (which I really didn't want to know about), as well as several references to wiping someone's derriere -- expressed much more graphically than ""derriere"". I, myself, found these references offensive. I don't want to read such language in a mystery."
1,SAVE YOUR $$$$,"Save your money.This DVD is a waste of money. It has a bunch of beat up ""Rat Rods"" and really doesn't focus on cars. Rent it if you really want to see it,it's terrible!"
3,probably not worth buying,"I am a very happy BabyWise mom, and On Becoming Babywise was very successful in my home. But this book is pretty useless, I ended up skimming a lot of pages b/c I was not interested in the ramblings of the author. There were a few pages of interest, but overall, I'm not sure I would recommend it. I felt the same way w/the 2nd Babywise book, although in that book I did like the feeding suggestions and timing."
4,Great Practical Book on Toddlers,"I am in the middle of reading this book and love it so far. The first couple of chapters seemed a little slow to me and a bit confusing. Some of the illustrations seemed a bit weird, but I continued on and have loved the rest of the book so far and the practical advice. I will definitely use some of the ideas on structuring your child's day and potty training when we get there."
1,This book is AWFUL! I threw mine away!,"Toddler Wise was awful. I am an educator with a masters degree in Education, Counseling and Guidance and Educational Leadership! No wonder why our kids are out of control. This book in not in the best interest of the child and the book Baby Wise is WORSE!! I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,It is not worth the $12.95 or even $8.,"The authors have a very nice style, unfortunately the book is not useful enough compared to ""What to Expect the Toddler Years"" ISBN : 0894809946."
1,"I HATE These So-Called ""Wise"" Books!","Try Dr. Sears' ""Family Dicipline Book."" It works better than this abusive method of parenting."
3,In the Hills,"This is a modest country story directed by the great cinematographer Karl Brown. It is not quite on a level with the similar classic silent he made called Stark Love, but it does not look down on its characters. They are not treated as ""hillbillies""."
5,GET READY TO ENTER A NEW WORLD OF MUSIC FOR MASSAGE,"I found this cd Detaching the World Vol. 4 at the Canyon Ranch Resort in Tucson. After receiving one of the most cleansing and purifying massages ever (while this music was playing in the background), I couldn't help but think of how wonderful it would be to add this cd to my practice. After my purchase, I listened to it for almost a week strait before returning home and trying it out on clients. As a full time massage therapist, this cd has played during many sessions, providing a peaceful, relaxed setting with the music. As most lmts know, it can be very frustrating finding that happy medium of music that connects clients and therapists. I will tell you that the purifying cleansing deep guitar notes on this cd will not leave you or clients dissapointed. This one's a keeper!"
3,not what expected,This is not one of our favorities--not as soothing as we had hoped.Wish we had been able to hear samples before buying.Will be sure to pick ones that have sample music.
4,"Fun story, great illustrations","Debbie Allen is bringing her amazing stage production of this book, Brothers of the Knight, to our city next month. So our family bought this book in anticipation. It is great fun, but of course, nothing can compare to the terrific music and jaw-dropping choreography of the actual show. I encourage anyone to read the book and see the show."
5,The Crisscross shadow,One of the best hardy boys out there full of fun and solving if your a fan of the hardy read this one
1,"Good Idea, bad product","I purchased this item about 18 months ago and I'm not particularly satisfied with it. It's a great idea - a phone and clock radio all in one - a great space saver. Unfortunately, this is not the model to buy. The display screen is at a difficult angle to see unless you raise your head. The controls are not particularly intuitive to use. The worst aspect of the unit, however, is the volume control. It is very imprecise and the volume can't be set low enough without cutting out completely. Don't waste your money...."
3,Later books are better?,"I started with A Cast of Corbies, which I liked a lot. In contrast, the Lark and the Wren was very slow-going, especially the first half (like other reviewers, I found a clear split between the 1st and 2nd half of the book). I thought the action picked up in the 2nd half (unlike other reviewers) but it didn't gel with the earlier part of the book."
4,"Good, Entertaining book","A very good book for those who play and enjoy music. It has many twists in the storyline, and lots of surprises. I loved the climax!"
4,exactly what i wanted,"this adapter was exactly what i needed for my creative zen vision m. its the perfect solution for those times that you accidentally hit the wire and you cd player/mp3 player falls onto the floor, or you get pulled by your ears when the wire is caught.its reliability is usually pretty good. the one complaint i have however is that it seemed to drop out frequently if the adapter was inside a pocket or compartment, and this didn't happen whenever there was a clear path between them and the headphones. its handy coiled wire makes it easy to hang out a pocket without worry of it getting damaged though."
4,Jabra A120s,"The adapter works well, and connects with everything I've tried. The only downside is that you can't use it while charging. Plugging in the USB charge cable immediately disables the device. On long trips in the car, this is a definite defect."
5,Different and Good Tool,This circle hoe is so different and easy to use. It goes in between the plants to weed and cultivate. Love it.
1,It did not work on my Stylus Color 600,"Despite its low price and its claim of 100% compatibility, it did not function at all on my Stylus Color 600. All it printed were some stains. I tried to call their 800 helpline but simply was asked to leave a message. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
5,Sylvia Browne is a trailblazer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read a lot of books.IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT I SEE is not just another book by Sylvia Browne. It is one of her finest books to date.Sylvia is an authority on everything she writes. Every chapter of this book is a gem. Sylvia writes in a very clear and understandable way. She touches your heart on every page.If you're not sure whether you should get this book, perish the thought. Trust me, this book will open doors in your mind.Armand Auger, M.D., retired"
1,Beginner Beware,"This book is impossible to learn from unless you know c++ like the person who wrote the language. I am using this book for my data structures class I'm in right now and it is useless. Our teacher is constantly finding things that are against normal convention. The code is very incomplete. Don't worry though, cause if you don't know c++ very very very well, you'll never even realize it. I compare his homework problems to teaching someone how to paint a bird house and then asking him how to build a skyscrapper. You should definetly avoid this book at all costs."
1,... poor examples,"This is my second time taking this class. The only reason, and I do mean the only reason why I have to retake this class is because many of the examples in the book are confusing. It just dawned on me today when I couldn't understand the Shell sort on page 256 - this is a simple concept. I had to reference another book in order to understand it and as it turns out, it was a simple concept. A second example of the confusion is the Huffman coding sequence on page 398 - I am having to go onto the internet because I just plain don't understand the example. In my personal opinion I do not feel the book is thorough enough . . . it needs to be written more simply with better diagrams and examples."
2,Academics only!,"This book is the text for the Data Structures course at my university. If your looking for a practical book on algorithms and data structures that you can put to immediate use... THIS IS NOT your book! Half written algorithms and critical parts of a program ""left as an exercise"" make this book a pain to read. This is clearly anacademic book that is not suitable for self-study!"
1,Don't Even Bother..,"I figured, try it what have you got to lose? I mean, who doesn't want to save a few bucks every time they have to replace their printer cartridges. What you ask? I installed it, I printed, I cleaned the heads 6 or 7 times. It leaves black marks all over the paper. Use Epson cartridges. Apparently, based on these reviews, when the Dataproducts cartridges work, they work fine, but they only work SOME of the time.."
5,Thoughtful and Gentle,"Mr. Parkin displays a gentleness, restraint, and romanticism that is too often lacking in interpretations of Poulenc. I've always believed there was a bit more Fauré (I'm thinking of his Ballade for solo piano here) than most interpreters allow. Listen to the Novelette No. 1 and the Nocturne No. 1 as examples. Also, the Mouvements Perpetuels are played with a more gentle touch than I've heard recorded. Yet, when the composer shows his humor, the pianist understands. An altogether satisfying, thoughtful, enduring interpretation of music too often overlooked."
1,More junk from HP,"HP continues to live off their printer reputation by engineering over-priced products that are riddled with bugs and incompatibility issues. I spend most of my time manually unplugging the set from the power supply because the system continually wigs out and locks up, and removing the power cable is the only way to reset it. Their search feature is archaic at best. What they don't tell you is that this device can only read certain bit/sampling rates. If you've copied your CDs using the Windows Media Player's WMA Lossless format the songs will not play on this device. By an XP computer and use the Windows Media Player with a good sound card and you'll be much happier and have a lot more functionality."
2,Glitchy and full of bugs,"I'm not at all happy with this device. While it does have excellent sound quality playing MP3 and WMA files, it is very buggy. It locks up frequently, is very moody, and doesn't play MPG or AVI files.I'm hoping for a firmware upgrade from HP to make it more stable.I would wait for the next model that is more robust and full featured."
3,"Great product, if you have patience","I had no trouble setting it up, the synchronization takes forever though, as does navigating the primitive menus. Not good for extensive music collections for that reason. Wireless works if you position it properly (IE don't put it in a cabinet with everything else in your home theater if it's a wired mess, and make sure you follow standard wireless rules about angles). The sound quality is great on high quality sound files. Good for me, who doesn't expect a miracle for $199 (shop at HP's online store for that price)."
4,"Very good, works great.",I bought this a couple weeks ago and got it hooked up to my Linksys wireless network quickly with no problems.I even have Panasonic 2.4 ghz wireless phones and there appears to be no intereference between the ew5000 and the phones.
4,FM Gold,"This is a nice collection of popular songs from 1972 sure to please even the harshest critic. ""Brandy"" by Looking Glass, America's ""I Need You"" and the ever popular ""Summer Breeze"" by my all time favorite group, Seals & Crofts. This will be a good addition to any CD collection"
4,is spider monkey black?,"This figurine is well made. It's true to description however I think spider monkeys are in black... If it is in darker color, it will be more realistic."
4,Inspiring light,"The author-painter teaches step-by-step the way to make watercolor paintings sparkle. Her own examples are breathtaking. If one really wants to acheive the skill to fill one's paitings with heavenly light, this is the book to start with."
5,Awesome book!,"I am inspired by the beautiful work she does. She gives very good detailed instructions on how to paint using her techinque and style. While I haven't been able to do what she does with layering of colors, this could be due to many other factors such as paint and paper quality. She also gives us helpful information on related topics around being an artist, and the various supplies and techniques. I highly recommend this book for someone who is fascinated by light and luminosity in watercolor as I am."
5,To be a Velveteen Mommy...,"Battered is beautiful - at least if you happen to be a mom! Jenn Doucette does a spectacular job of reminding her readers what a ""real"" mom looks like: worn, weary, and exhilarated by the thrill of raising little ones. May we celebrate our maternal scars so that we, too, can delight in being the Velveteen Mommy."
2,Less scripts more facts.,First of all I didn't know this book was of a religious nature. The book has several good organizational ideas but I felt too much of the book was devoted to silly scripts. Would have liked to see more breakout topics and some testimonials.
4,cute stocking stuffer,"this is a super cute, small toy. great for a stocking stuffer or just a little gift for something special."
2,Very cute,Slinky is one of the most wanted characters from Toy Story. He is cute and unique and our 4 year old was so pleased to receive him. He stretches out and doesn't contract very well but he does complete the character set.
1,broke quickly,It broke already. Also why does it have a string in the mddle of it? We had a slinky dog toy when Toy story frst came out that was well made. This was not.
4,Could be bigger,"I got it for a 3 year old it is cute but really small. I guess I was expecting to get the same one from the Disney store but other than that the quality was ok, the size was just what I didn't really like. Good for little kids."
3,Okay toy,We bought this because my son wanted it. Slinky is so hard to keep untangled and is next to impossible to untangle.
4,Making a refill work,"If your refilled cartridge fails to work, place the print head in a shallow dish of water with one drop of detergent. Let it soak over night, and then wipe the head dry and install. The soak will remove dried ink deposits that cause the failure. Run the ""clean head"" option on the printer after installation."
5,Excellent Films,"I first saw Sharpe's Rifles on PBS and found myself glued to the TV set. I didn't know that the series was on Video until I checked out Amazon. These movies were excellent. The video is not exactly in tune with the books, but frankly I didn't really care. Sean Bean is excellent as Sharpe, good acting overall."
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this shoe, but when I tried it on, it was incredibly narrow. I don't have a wide foot by any means, so it was rather disappointing that it didn't even come close to fitting. The shoe was exactly what I wanted, but just way too narrow. I returned via Amazon and UPS."
2,A Low-burning Flame,"This is a good beach read, when the lethargy of too much sun halts the crirical faculties. There are many holes in motivation, plot, and history. The author can't decide if Lily is Jackie Chan or Florence Nightingale, and when Lily does kill in self-defence ... it goes nowhere. Lily grieves for her Great Lost Love, Rafi (Ralph Landon), for about 5 minutes after learning he died a year earlier, and hastily acquires a new suitor about twice her age. But it's light fun, and zooms past in an hour or so."
4,Excellent book for technical types,"Most people try to avoid fats, attempting to use common sense. However, one's body does require some essential fats. Also fats are added to many processed foods. And restaurant food has lots of fat so that it tastes good.It would be great to find out which fat sources are better than others, from a health point of view. This book goes further than most to give you a readable analysis on choosing the better fats and incorporating them into a lifelong diet.My review is especially for the previous edition pub in 89, now out of print."
