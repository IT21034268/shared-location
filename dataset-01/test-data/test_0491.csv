1,unhappy kitties,"Like many here, after hearing favorable reviews about Soft Paws, I just had to try them out on our 3 cats. They looked adorable and seemed to be a practical idea. Hubby and I applied them correctly. Two of our cats seemed to tolerate them well, while the youngest hated them from the start. I went to work and came home only to find all 3 of their claws mangled and torn to the quick. They were able to bite off all but a few of the Soft Paws. The cats were very unhappy - and hid when I came in the door (not like them at all!) I felt so bad for them, and will never use them again."
4,Great product,"I love these things because they stay on for many many weeks and keep my cat from destroying everything! We can now coexist peacefully and that makes me very happy.As great as they are, you really have to watch out to make sure that the nails eventually shed. I had a problem on a few nails where they started to become ingrown and would have eventually grown to touch the pad of her paw had I not cut them off, and started fresh."
1,Handle fell off ladle after first use.,"While being dried with a dish towel after first use and hand-washing, the handle fell off of one of the ladles. I hope to return for a refund."
3,Funny and kids love them,but kids also imitate silly things Pingu does. Not sure if I want my kids to imitate the silly penguin. Shaun Sheep may be better.
4,Death in the a Shau Valley,Good book. Serves in he same AO during my tour. This brought back many memories....some good...some not so good. Enjoyed reading this book.
2,Not up to par,"I am a Vietnam infantry veteran and served with the 101st Airborne Div during this same time period. Chambers first book, Recondo, was much more interesting and far more accurate. This effort seems to have come from an author who never felt the heat of combat, just heard the stories, I know however, that is not true in this case. His recollections bounce around so much I kept getting lost in the stories. While I was ""only a leg"" my company employed most all of the super sneeky tactics you macho LRRPs seem to have invented. I bought this book based on the author, my mistake."
5,classic,A classic book that your child will love. I read it again and again as a child. Buy this book if you have a thoughtful child.
2,Very disappointed,"I wanted to treat myself to a nice pen but didn't want to spend an extravagant amount of money on it. So after reading the good reviews on the Paper Mate PhD, I decided to buy it.I've been using it for a couple of days now and I just don't like this pen's writing ability. The ""Lubriglide"" system doesn't glide at all. The pen skips a lot and the ink comes out looking a dull grey rather than a sharp black. And when I write, the ballpoint clatters against the edge where it emerges from the pen, giving me this constant rattling sound. Opening the pen and re-seating the ink cartridge within the barrel hasn't helped, so I'm under the impression that either the hole at the end of the barrel is too wide or the cartridge is too narrow.On the positive side, it's a nice looking pen and is very comfortable to write with. The ergonomic grip is soft, but not so soft as to make the pen difficult to control. I just wish the mechanics of ink delivery were better."
5,Great Memory Card,This Memory card was worth getting since i wasn't able to find it in stores like GameStop or Bestbuy. Shipping was great; comes in a Bubble Wrapped envelope and was not harmed by anything. Works on PS2 and works fine. 5/5.
4,The Original,"I ' ll give it to ya streight. It's a memory card. Sure it needs a boot CD but at least you don't have to do it over and over again. Once a game of mine corrupted but that's because I was out of space. And the game doesn't work real great. If you buy a aftermarket card theres more of a risk, less price.I say, dont risk and spend the bucksand yes this card works in all PS2's slim, and fat"
4,Extensive Latin-English and English-Latin dictionary,"This is a great dictionary for students who are past the introductory college level, and are reading Latin prose and poetry; or other readers who need a dictionary more extensive than a pocket edition. Each entry contains pronounciation, numerous examples, usage by Latin authors, and some word etymology."
3,Decent dictionary,"This is a decent dictionary, but not for absolute beginers. It has no grammar and some missing words that are pretty common, still they should be there. Overall it's a good dictionary, considering that it has also an english-latin part."
2,"playful reading: positive fun ways to build the bond between preschoolers, books, and you","This book may be helpful to parents who work one-on-one with children, but not so helpful to caregivers and preschool teachers who work with a group of children at any given time."
3,"Helps, but not as much as I thought","This lens is supposed to double the magnification of any given eyepiece it is used with. I suppose it does, but to me the difference wasn't that obvious. Probably depends a lot on the aperture of your telescope (mine is 114 mm), since magnification can only do so much with limited light. However, the quality of the materials/lens itself seems adequate, and you can't beat the Orion company's customer service."
3,not sure I got what I ordered,"Just got the watch today and I am not sure it is the gold plated one I ordered. It looks more like the gold ""tone"" model and since there was no documentation on the order slip and no markings on the watch, there is no way to be sure which one it is. Also leading me to assume it is the gold tone is that on the inside cover of the watch it has a large metallic type scratch/discoloration. Lastly, the manufacturer is not dutray but ""Luis cardini"", which also makes me wonder what I really got."
2,Not what I expected,"This watch came earlier then expected, however it was suppose to come in a box and did not also the watch is a lot more gold then what the picture represented. It looks cheap. The face is nice and easy to read. No way is this a $100 watch originally. It's a $20 costume jewelry watch. Very disapointed"
5,A must-have!,"This book is a MUST for anyone who teaches in an elementary, middle or high school. Its anecdotal format makes it easy to use as a quick reference guide. I have given at least 10 of these books as gifts over the past few years. It is excellent!"
2,It's ok to solo; but what else?,"As a Naui Divemaster, I looked forward to this book expanding my own horizons and teaching me more about diving. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Instead of learning new techniques and applications for solo diving, I found 2 things: 1) justification upon justification that solo diving was OK, and 2) redundant breathing systems. While I agree that solo diving has somewhat of a taboo status, I would think that anyone who buys this book does not need convincing that solo diving is viable. And while I agree that redundant air systems are important, there are other techniques (such as lift bags and double first stages) that I hoped would be touched on. But what you have is a rather short book, which would have very little body if you removed the two topics I mentioned. Anything in here, a good diver should already be aware of."
4,It can change the way you see solo-diving,"Very good in security in solo diving aspects, and some good hints about solo diving conducing, i found it a good book."
2,Faulty pens?,"I have used these pens for quite a while now, and have always been pleased, until now. I do a lot of word search puzzles so I am very particular about the type of pen I use and I like a bold, smooth writing pen. The last batch that I received(i always order two boxes) a majotity of the pensI used had to be pressed hard and turned to one side or the other to make a mark! I keep changing pens out of the box to find one that works consistently, I have not had this problem before and am not happy to have it now. I have experienced the same problem with both of the boxes I received. Has the manufacturer changed the formula?"
5,No problem,"Green pens that I've used for everything for the last twenty years. Full boxes, okay packaging, shipped on time. Product arrived as advertised, no issues, no problemo."
2,Could be more heat resistant,"Although I thought this product worked well in removing excess fat, it now has several long cracks in it and will have to be replaced in the very near future. This is really annoying since I've only had it for a couple of months. I plan on buying a [upgraded]glass separator."
3,Good Read but too many typos in the code examples,"This book is a good read for someone fairly experienced in HTML and aquianted with Web application development who wants to add XML to his or her skillset. It does a fairly good job of explaining to what I feel is a satisfactory level of depth the various topics covered. Downside: alot of theory and concepts but not enough examples. If you are looking for a workbook, something with exercises to practicaly apply what you have learned, this is NOT it. BEWARE: the code examples in the ""projects"" section is RIFE with typographical errors. Obviously, the proofreader of this book is not a programmer as he/she missed ALL of the typos. This is especially frustrating for beginners as it breaks the pages and causes hours of frustration which could have easily been avoided. Better off to rely on the online examples provided on their download site."
3,its ok..but i was a little disaapointed,i mean the movies isnt that great and its not that bad...its in the middle. I was given the impression that it was gunna show ALL the moves..or maybe just like the hot ones....some of them are hot..but not the ones that you guys have been working on. If u wanna learn how to wave and tick...and just see some dancing then buy it.Why is it that Marques Houston walked in on the freesytle but said he had music....Omari was there. And they prolly live together whyd Omari ask what hes been doing since the movie...man u know..your his brother...just like the movie..it wasnt that well thought out....Chris Stokes if you ever read this You got served 2 better be much better...and for the instructional..give us moves that we wanna learn not those others...ok
5,This movie aint nothin but a thang,"This movie is hot, before I watched it I was always gettin served by the other guys and girls on my block. But now that I know how to dance just like in ""You Got Served"" I am servin them fools up left and write. Whenever I walk down the streets peoples gettin served, 'like wow'. Whenever I order fries at the Burger King peoples gettin served, 'like wow'. Whenever I see my baby's mamma peoples gettin served, 'like wow'. I'm talkin all the time, for real, I served this one fool up so much last week he still served. BAM."
4,Great for the kids,This is a great video for my kids who love to street dance. It keeps them moving and they can learn the steps so easily.
4,Great dance moves,My son is still working on learning these dance moves. So if its got his attention no doubt it's got mine.
3,the main focus of the dvd needs to be adjusted,"I liked the ""You got served"" movie and actually wanted to learn the moves and how they did what they did. I did not want to learn the actual routines of what I saw in the movies due to the fact that I can't use them at the club or to freestyle. The only reason I gave it a three was that during the middle of the DVD the instructor teaches a basic point of ticking, waving, and popping. That actually meant something to a basic person that doesn't have a clue about dancing. To me ... it meant nothing. I think 2 people can get this DVD. A person that wants a session of ticking, waving, and popping that lasted around 3-4 minutes or a person that wants to learn routines done in the movie that you also need a couple other people in sync with you to make it look actually nice."
3,"I love the movies. Only problem is when I got them, the inside that would hole them all together was broken into pieces","I love the movies. Only problem is when I got them, the inside that would hole them all together was broken into pieces. Not too happy"
3,Awesome series...poor DVDs (no widescreen),"In an age where NO ONE can buy an old school 4:3 TV anymore and HDTV has been the norm for almost ten years, I find it ridiculous that the NFL can't put out a widescreen DVD set. Or, even a Blu Ray disk set at 1080P. All of these shows were recorded in and shown on the NFL Network in High Definition....why just full screen DVD's?The content, formatting aside, is incredible and I think these are some of the best Super Bowl documentaries created. Steelers hold the most!"
1,More NFL films drivel,"If you are a long-time Steeler fan, don't waste your money on this re-hash of NFL films clips. Here's what you get: 1) The usual few slow motion clips set to dramatic-sounding orchestral music, 2) Old interviews that have been around for decades and have been sold on other videos. The total package is great for: 1)People who have never seen the many other productions containing this stuff, 2) Hero-worshipping little children. I wish the NFL would realize that there are many longtime football fans who just want to watch the old games (before VCR taping of games was common) in full, rather than this sort of BS. The game really can stand on it's own! The DVD collections ""Steelers Road to XL"" and ""Steelers Road to XLIII"" are both great--nothing but the uncut, uninterrupted playoff games from the 2005 and 2008 seasons. However in the age of DVRs, many fans have these games taped already. The same does not hold true for the great games of the 1970s."
4,Thumbs up for Gigabeat MEG-F60S 60 GB Digital Audio Player.,"This is my first purchase of a high capacity Digital Audio Player.I could not be happier with My Gigabeat. I use it for both audio play back and a portable hard drive. It's so cool to know that I could back up my entire system on to my Audio Player.After trying both the Windows Media Player sync to my Gigabeat 60 GB and Gigabeat Room (the software that comes with the Gigabeat audio player). I settled on the Gigabeat Room for 2 reasons.1) It encrypts the audio files transferred to Gigabeat much faster than Windows Media player.2) When you connect the Gigabeat to a PC. It has to know if you want to talk to Windows Media player or Gigabeat Room. If you choose Windows Media Player, Windows will not assign a drive letter to Gigabeat and you can't use it as a hard drive. If you choose Gigabeat Room it will.I have used the hard drive portion on both Windows XP and 2000, it works flawlessly.Great unit, no complaints. Go get it."
1,HORRIBLE,"Do not buy this item. I spent many hours loading music into it, which all then disappeared. Even though I had saved the music on my hard drive also, I could not load it back in. If you buy a Toshiba Gigabeat, BUYER BEWARE. This is a terrible unit~~!!!!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I saw this movie. There is no diamond dust, nor any ""rebellion"". It's just one angry guy with a grudge against Captain Hitsugaya. Other than that, the movie just kind of showcases some characters. It is not bad - in a ""pretty decent fanfic"" sort of way. But, I felt that the movie looks rushed. Many of the standard Tv episodes are better than this ""feature""."
5,a blonde babe,Probably the prettiest blonde PMOY babe in recent history. A must-see. Too bad her older sister made only a casual appearance.
1,Don't wast your time OR your money!,"I believed another poster in these pages who said that Robert Gant went full frontal in this movie. Not only does he show far less here than he does in Queer as Folk, but ALL the sex is simulated; and half heartedly at that. Cinemax late night gives you more. God, how I wish I could get my money back! I gave it one star because I had to."
5,Life on Mars: UK Style,"I truly enjoyed the American version of LOM. And this second UK LOM season was similar yet had many differences that makes one glad one watched both. Outstanding characters, powerful stories, and wonderful thought-provoking ideas interlaced with enjoyable entertainment. If you like stories about the 1970's, with a sci-fi twist, this will be a real delight."
2,not great,"Unfortunately, the cds skip if the dresser that it's on is even tapped. It seems to go into pause mode and then we press the play button to get it to play again, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. For some reason, the play button does not work, and has to be persistantly pressed.This Spongebob CD player boombox was a gift a few months ago from out of state, so returning it or attempting to contact the manufacturer is probably not worth the trouble."
3,Homeless in Paradise,"I enjoyed this book a lot because it has so much local flavor and taste. I have one major complaint that may or may not be important to you. It is the fact that the Mr. McMillan calls Spam Musubi's Rice Bombs. No one I know ever uses that term and is the first I heard of it. The author uses this reference several time and once he called it Spam Musubi. Maybe that is just a little detail, but it breaks the local feeling. Yes the book is unrealistic in how easy two people with substance abuse problems were able to turn around there lives. But I like happy endings and this had a happy, but unrealistic ending."
3,Interesting but unsatisfying,"The Floating City does a wonderful job of bringing Hawaii in the 1890s to life. Ball's descriptions are so wonderful you can almost smell them. Her writing is lovely and carries the reader along not wanting to stop. But what the books fails at is completing the story. There are far too many unanswered questions - not the least of which is how a woman from Norway (and not a very well schooled one at that) is managing to communicate with the Hawaiians and haoles. There's no explanation for why our heroine, Eva, suddenly decides to play detective despite everything telling her to run. Many of the books I read often leave me feeling that a good editor should have trimmed some of the story, this is the first in which I wish more had been added."
3,"Good raw material, sloppy presentation","If you're a UT football fan, this DVD is probably worth having as a collected reminder of the team's best season (and best player) in the past 30 years. It's too bad that the quality of the presentation is so poor. The highlights in and of themselves are great, and provide all the stars, but proper context is not always provided. In one instance, in a UT touchdown highlight you can see a referee signalling incomplete--was the call overturned? No mention is made in the voiceover. And while I generally am a fan of Verne Lundquist, this is not his best work. He was so flat at times I was surprised to see his name in the credits.Worse, the UT stats bonus feature is so riddled with errors it's embarrassing. At one point Limas Sweed is listed as ""Linas Sweed.""Too bad: a great season deserved better treatment."
5,Correct part for the job,Product was the correct fit and works perfectlyArrived on time as promised.ThanksDan Piett
2,Bad Railing,"The bed looks Ok, but has a dangerous railing with sharp edges (which you cannot see on the picture, because they look smooth on the picture but it does not show that they are not rounded on the edge). My daugher is very active, and often jumps with her head toward the bed, and has already hurt herself on the edge of the railing. So we had to cover the railing with an extra mattress cover, just imagine how ugly that looks and how inconvenient it is to change the sheets."
5,Nice and scary.,"Once it is started, you can tell this is one of the old movies. The movie is probably low budget, but good for that day and time."
1,The howling reborn,"Not an epic failure, but boring. I expected a 2011 movie to be worthy of watching, this movie was not worthy of my time. It had good special effects compare to B movies. However there were times when you could see how cheap it was. In example when school was burning, the fire looked so bad. The werewolf costume looked so cheap actually, especially the legs. When 2 werewolves collapsed, you could well see that there is no life captured in those costumes. There was either one of actors present or none at all. Not until the next scene. I don't think there is really any point in writing more about the movie itself, it was so boring to watch. Not an epic failure, but it's bad. I would NOT consider it to be another Howling movie. Yes, howling is notorious for a few good and most bad movies mixed together in one huge sequel/collection. But why this movie? It's out of place. There is nothing about rebirth and nothing about howling at all. Could give it another name."
4,More than a Dictionary,"This book is very good because it presents you the vocabulary that you're reaaly gonna find in the TOEFL iBT. However, it is important to have a good dictionary following the studies."
4,"Excellent, but feet fall off","I have had this for a while now, and it's probobly the best grater I've used; however, all three feet fell off. It still performed beyond any other grater (and it's still the only box-type grater I've seen with a side that does the ""fancy"" smaller shredding size). I wouldn't hesitate to buy another, even if it was doomed to be footless."
4,"Good Stuff, Quick Shipping",I received this item in two days and it seems to be working great. Highly recommended.
5,HANK IS GOD AND HANK III IS JESUS!,ok in true HONKY PUNK fashion my friend SHELTON WILLIAMS (aka HANK III) has done it again!this is one of the best PUREST country albums EVER!forget what you hear on the radio or on CMT this is real!BUY IT!
2,Mostly garbage,"Although most of the music and lyrics could be written by a third grader, the song ""I want to drive the Zamboni"" expresses the emotions felt by many hockey fans and ice skaters. Not for the average music fan, this CD is directed to the junior high and high school age hockey player/fan."
2,"packaging is a huge downer, otherwise, fine","So the taste is fine. The lime IS unsweetened, okay, fine, and the flavor does come through. No, it doesn't have any real tartness or ""fresh lime"" quality. But it does add lime flavor. But WHY THEY CAN'T offer this in a jar, resealable bag, etc., instead of tiny packets that have so little solid inside that it's actually hard to empty the contents--that, I don't get. Plus it's a lot of little garbage to throw away that surely isn't necessary."
5,It's a WOW!,"The idea of this book was fascinating and does bring back intensity of the 'Silence of the Lambs' interaction - and it is as effective in this wonderful read.Wilson Velez is a prisoner who formed an ultra-violent gang who is in a high security prison and has a given a new court review to moderate his life at the prison - Lisbeth was a popular serial writer, whose subject has gotten worn, and failing sales - She decides to interview Wilson and maybe get herself writing again.The 'dance' between writer Lisbeth and Wilson is mesmerizing - and soon you get so caught up you wonder who is really telling the true story - who is the manipulator - is Wilson a visionary or is he still the ultra-violent gang leader still operating in this high security prison?The ending and its events that proceed it are thought provoking and will haunt you after you close the book.Well worth the hardback price."
5,On my top ten list!,"Oh gosh, I don't even know how to start. I picked up Claws and Effect, a later book in the series, at my school's library last year and within minutes of starting it I was gobbling it up! I mean, murder, southern gentry, small-town gossip, and talking animals!!!! HOW GREAT CAN LIFE GET!? AND the dog is a CORGI *I am a considerably HUGE corgi fan* Written with wit and whimsy, Rita Mae Brown is my third favorite author. I am currently finishing ""Murder She Meowed"" (I read them all out of order) and it is my favorite Mrs. Murphy mystery yet!!! Hilarious! A MUST READ!!!"
4,Good Introduction to ASP,"This book is a great introduction to ASP. Since it's a ""beginner's book"" it's not going to cover everything you need to know, but it's a fantastic start! If you know nothing or very little about ASP, this is an excellent choice for you."
2,GIRLS OF SOUTH BEACH,"THIS IS ONE THE WEAKER PLAYBOY DVD'S, WHILE THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY AND MOST IF NOT ALL GO COMPLETELY NUDE, THE EDITING AND MUSIC ARE TERRIBLE AND I LIKE ""NATURAL"" GIRLS, THESE GIRLS LOOKED PLASTIC TO MERANDY"
5,We LOVE our Track'r Trailer!!!!!,"We LOVE our Track'r Trailer!!! Did I already say that? We bought it so that we can take Briggs and Angus, our two Maltese, along on our bike ride/rollerblades to the Pier - and we also got the Stroller Kit for taking them other places that we may not be able to take them otherwise. It was so easy to assemble, and they jumped right in. They love riding in it!! Briggs, who is 15, sleeps comfortably and Angus looks out the window. There is plenty of room for both of them. My fiance loves pulling them on his bike, attaching and detaching it is simple and the hitch is barely noticable on the bike when the trailer is not attached. Converting from a trailer to a stroller is so easy, as is folding it up to transport it. It fits in the back of my MINI, no problem. We are very impressed with the quality - it is very well made and really nice looking!! We are thrilled with our purchase!!! All of our dog owner friends - and their dogs - are jealous!!!"
4,"Works great, but one hole not drilled properly.","This works great and fits on my bike fine. There was only one problem. A hole was not drilled properly so that the stroller kit (that you buy separately) doesn't work right. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Two 12 pound dogs fit in it fine. One of my dogs barks constantly--but that is not the fault of the manufacturer. I believe it is because he hates to be confined. So if your dog has a problem with being caged, think twice. The other dog likes it just fine, and in fact even the barker will jump in with encouragement, so they don't mind the ride itself. The attachment to the bike is well designed so that it is pretty easy to attach and detach the trailer, and there is a safety strap as well."
2,Strong Plastic Smell,I got this trailer two days ago and I haven't been able to use it yet because the plastic off-gas is so strong. I've left it out in the sun and washed the trailer with soapy water which seemed to help. It looks like a well built trailer and I'm excited to take my dogs for a bike ride. I hope the off-gasing clears soon. I didn't buy the trailer to sit and look at(at a distance). I'm surprised the company would send a product that an animal would ride in that had such a strong plastic odor.
3,Fills in some of the missing spots in the KISSOLOGY series,"When they both came out on VHS in the 90's these were about as good as you could get out of KISS. Now that the KISSOLOGY series has gone through 3 releases, & passed over this time period, It's good to have the ""Konfidential"" part, as a record of the Revenge era tour. Think of this release as a little bit of cement to slap the bricks of the KISSOLOGY series together with. Now if they'd just re-release the Unplugged DVD again."
3,it will do,The book didn't cover a lot of the type of hats I was wanting to try to make. It did provide good information about other types of hats and how to. I was looking for more pattern details and materials for suggested use.
5,Great Book!,Great book! Has everything you need to make a hat!!! It is essential for all hatmakers either beginers or professional!
5,Float them or Lose them,Very impressed with this product. I have 3 keys on mine wight is about a quarter pound and this Magnificent Key Chain still flouts. This is a must have for all you boaters.
5,Great series for little girls,"My 7 year old daughter loves this series! She's read the first 4, can't wait for the next books. Classic story lines and really kept her attention."
4,Wish they were metal like the old days,There is nothing like having a spare part for when you need it. I grabbed a couple of these since my model of Coleman lantern and stove both use the same part. Cheap insurance.
1,Pretty... but very poor quality of play,"Even at the ""hard"" setting your partner is a very poor player, focusing only on earning tricks and not on strategy at all. In a game you are in effect playing against your opponents as well as your partner. That puts it in a ""1"" category in my view."
5,Delightful,"I ordered this machine last week and we surprised how quickly it arrived. I opened the box, followed the instructions, and found my wildest expectations completely exceeded. Making ice cream is so easy that it is not worth going to the store anymore. Besides, the taste is so much better than the ice cream that comes in the paper containers."
3,light read,"As a third year college student, this book was only mildly helpful. I would recommend it as light reading ONLY. If you are about to enter college and want to do some reading before arriving, this book might be helpful. But if you're a student with anxiety and/or depression looking for real help, real answers, and real relief, this book will let you down.The authors address too many issues. The result is that they sacrifice really expanding on any of them. For example, while you may be most interested in depression -- this book covers everything from sexual education to being upset about graduation or some other irrelevant circumstance.There are much better books on this subject -- with much more depth. ."
1,No customer service,I can't say if the speakers meet the claimed specifications since I've experienced problems getting them powered up. Pyle's customer service has ignored all my e-mail requests for advice and assistance.Also beware that the speakers were manufactured in China. I didn't expect that.
5,Insanity! It was what he feared most!,"What the EE has always feared most has happened. He has gone insane! How could it be that a man 2000-3000 years old suddenly goes insane, starts killing his friends and becomes the demented ruller like Caligula whom he had always despised. Riveting historical parallels. Pay attention to the events that plunge the Empire into chaos, and see parallels to what is occuring or has occured in our(human) history before."
4,High Space Adventure in Classic SI-FI Style!!,"I read this book not knowing at the time that it was just one in a series. I Found THAT out pretty quick!! Regardless, it kept me entralled till the end, and I went hunting for the others!! Great High Space Adventure in the truest of the Classic SI-FI form!! Loads of action without bogging down in technical explainations. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes action oriented SI-FI."
5,Excellent to understand this complex country.,"I am currently researching Peru. This is one of the best books I have found. It covers all the key issues. The authors are insightful and discuss key points while being easy to read. After reading this book, the reader will have a much better understanding of what has led to modern Peru. Could not ask for more from a book!"
3,Great quality for the price,"These cables are value for money. You may not compare them to Belkins or Monsters, but if you are looking for something for day to day usage, these cables are great. I am using them for my band's practices- to carry keyboard output to the mixer. I didn't need speciality cables for recording or live sound, so these cables do the job well."
2,Typical for-dummies format,"The book focuses on MySql and is a how-to for the commands and it's sql dialect. If you want to learn the concepts of Objects and Object Orientation, keep looking."
2,this is not what it looks like,"caution... do you know what a 20 or 40 oz mop head is????Do you know this mop wringer is only about 6 inches wide.. which is not really big enough for a regular industrial mop?do you know the seller does not offer refunds? Seller doesnt respond, Amazon had to help me... This could be the mop squeeze wringer you need... it wasnt for me.. the picture is deceiving"
2,Not a great potty-training book,"My toddler loves Caillou, but this book doesn't do much to help facilitate potty training. My son never thought of wearing his potty chair on his head until we read it in this book. Ugh. It also isn't very clear about what Caillou is doing on the potty, and there is too much emphasis on his accidents. I think we read this book twice before I donated it to our library - I figured that way at least a parent could read through it to decide if it would help them before spending money on it."
1,Weird little uptight book,"This book is so tangibily, eerily, uncomfortable with its subject matter, it's bizarre. ""Caillou, use the potty when you have to go,"" says his mother. Elimination is described as ""having to go,"" another six times throughout the story, and that's as specific as it gets. When Caillou's father empties the potty into the toilet, the accompanying illustration shows Caillou standing outside the bathroom door, looking embarrassed. Why? In Caillou's world, potty training is done to please your parents, accomplished without their help, and doesn't involve any of the unseemly details. Pooh pooh."
2,It's all about the sex.,"Forget the title; nothing is happening ""on-line"". It's just a gimmick to have a computer in the vicinity of the 2 sex-starved main characters when the action heats up. The characters are completely interchangeable, uninteresting, and one dimensional. He could be the plumber and she a dog-walker, it just doesn't matter. In each case, he's unbelieveably handsome and well hung, and she's drop-dead gorgeous and built like a brick outhouse. Somehow they've managed to keep their hands off each other for some length of time, but by the time we meet them, the dam has burst. There's nothing left for them to do but get naked and get nasty. Lather, rinse, repeat, ad nauseam. Ms. McCarthy is very thorough in her descriptions of two people in the heat of passion. She gets 2 stars for that. The rest is filler. The moral of each story is that hot sex equals True Love and they all live happily ever after. So if you can swallow all of that, this book is for you."
4,Keeps You Flexible,Very nice DVD. Just the right stretches for a 50+ age viewer. Mirabai is easy to follow and it gives you a nice workout.
5,This is the best character animation book for Maya.,"This is the best training book by far for Maya character animators. Even though the program is now dated, the theories and exercises are excellent and Phil Young's illustrations are very clear and concise. Young is a traditionally trained artist/animator so he knows what he is talking about, and he translates 2D physics to Maya very well.The book is concise and well written and the illustrations are plentiful and simple to understand. The best feature of this book is that the enclosed CD contains the generic animation figure ""Generii"" created by Andrew Silke. Generii is used for the exercises instead of the usual 'realistic' (and often extremely poorly designed)character. The well-planned exercises and explanations work for any CGI program, so it is too bad that the title is going to date the book badly--look past the title and get this book if you are interested in learning character animation in CGI."
1,Stupid and more stupid....,This is garbage pure and simple. You will not want to use your computer after this.
2,not very easy to use,i find it very hard to get the front wheel to turn and it is stiff. i am disapointed in the effort it takes to put the kit on. the tightning bolt broke within a week of getting it. you can not have anything in the trailer to change to stroller
5,Greatest Comic Since Calvin and Hobbes.........,"I have been reading the web version of Sheldon for months now, and I have to say this is one of the funniest, charming, most intelligent comic strips. I can only wait in anticipation of the next volume!Pure Ducky Goodness will not disappoint you!Thanks for the laughs Dave!!"
5,Great comic strip!,"Pure Ducky Goodness is a title that hit's the contents of this book right on the head!A great read for those that have never seen the strip, as well as those fans of the daily web comic version at Comics.ComThe humor spans all ages, and genres. Everything from tech to geek to old folk (i.e. myself) humor is there for the belly laughs.Worth more than the price of admission!"
5,Great little slicer,This is a great slicer for the money. It works very well for everything I have tried so far. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Every kitchen needs one!,This has got to be one of the nicest kitchen tools ever made.. It slices perfectly and it has 4 attachment total! It makes the perfect hasbrown shavings! It's very easy to clean and small enough to fit in a small cuboard! The attachments come on ring so you will never loose them!
3,. . .,I have used my slicer once so far and it did what I expected it to do. I like the fact that you can put it over your pan or bowl and slice right into it.
3,Thickness,"I bought this one as a replacement. It doesn't take out much room. Comfortable to hold. It is super sharp. Not sure how long this sharpness will last since I only got it recently. When use thin slice for potato, lemon, carrot, and ginger, I got 2mm thin slices; but for onion, I got 3mm slices. Won't do good job at slicing tomato at all. The thick slices measured 5mm~6mm. For string cuts, they are size 3mm and 9mm. I gave it 3 stars is because I was expecting the slices would be a little bit thinner, won't say 0.5 mm paper thin but about 1mm~1.5mm."
1,Unsafe!!!,"I bought this on Saturday and was excited to try it out so I could save time in cutting all the vegetables I normally cut each day. For about the first three minutes I was impressed with how fast it cut and how sharp the blade was. Then I got to the celery and was going to town cutting away but I had to hold the celery straight up to get it cut the way I wanted it. I was not paying attention apparently because all of a sudden I saw blood. Lots of blood. I didn't feel a thing but I completely cut off the end of my thumb. I spent five hours in the emergency room before the doctor could get my wound cauterized, cleaned up, and bandaged. I threw this dangerous piece of equipment out Sunday morning before anyone else in my house could get injuried.I suggest spending a little more and getting something safer."
1,Don't even bother,"We bought an Atomix clock very similar to this one ( looks like this one ), a few years back from Walmart for around $30. It was our first atomic clock. It stinks. It won't synchronize most of the time, even though we live in Denver, about 30 miles from the signal source. And even if you set it with the correct time, most of the time it will un-synchronize itself the following night and show the wrong time and date the next day!We're so disgusted with the thing that we won't even give it away to Goodwill, we're actually thinking of taking it out in the sticks and shooting it, to put it out of its misery.Since then someone told us that La Crosse made atomic clocks that work and we bought 2 of theirs. They synchronize flawlessly, every day without fail, for the last 2 years that we've had them. I'd recommend a La Crosse instead."
3,"Easy to use, hard to clean","I bought this because I was SO tired of peeling garlic with a paring knife. It is really easy to use, but a pain to clean.If you are peeling more then 3 cloves it is a pain in the rear. The roller gets too full and you have to rinse it out but then the water makes it not work, so you have to dry it too. There is very little time saved with the roller. I used it for about 3 weeks and then moved to just whacking the clove with the side of the knive and manually peeling."
1,This item is a joke,This item is a joke. It does not work very well. Use a knife blade flat on a garlic clove and hit the blade with you hand. This technique works better than anything. Watch any chef peel garlic and that is what they do. You will never see a chef use this useless device. Save your money
2,this is why iPod costs more,"my first mp3 player. a good learning experience on the cheap, but i found that you get what you pay for. sent it back to Buslink for the second time, recently - first fail was the volume control stopped working - second fail (on a brand-new replacement) was the headphone jack will only play one channel. Buslink customer service is GOOD, with 1-year warranty (past 30-days on first fail, so too late to return to original internet seller). controls and operating system are crude (expected on a cheap-o off-brand), and the display is too tiny - battery indicator must about 1mm in size. Not a bad unit, but i wish it worked more than it was in the shop. I won't send it back a third time - not worth the postage and hassle - i'll just use it as a pen drive. i now think an ipod shuffle would be better, for not much more money, and you would only be giving up the display."
2,Watch Out,"These pens leak way too frequently. Used them on and off for years, but problem persists. Not often catastrophic ink explosions, but have a unique way of getting ink on my hands and clothes without my knowing until it's too late. Overpriced to boot. A better alternative is the Sanford Uni-Ball Micro. Better pen and cheaper."
2,Misleading desc,"desc states is it a .25mm micropoint but these are extra fine point (pen label) which I already had. Buyer beware. Product ID 35335 was on the box, so not an orderfilling error."
1,"Pen is awesome, BUT it is not a pack of 12","Unless they forgot my other 11 pens, this is not a pack of 12. Amazon please fix the description.Other than that these pens are by far the best than any other i have used."
1,UPDATE: This pen is even worse than I'd thought!,"My review dissents, and is brief: I find this pen to write choppy - not a continuous flow of ink - and it feels scratchy on the page. Love the form factor in the hand. After buying many fine-point pens, I favor the Uniball Vision Elite Micro 0.5mm to this pen.UPDATE: 2 years later, and the news gets even worse: my Pilot pens have a 100% explosion rate. Every single one has, at one point, exploded in my pocket or hand, making a mess all over the place. No other pen has done this. And: the Uniball is still fine."
3,ok book,this book was ok but the first half was really boring so if yoou like a good book all the way thorough then you shouldnt read this one.
2,Defeats the purpose of a scale,"While I don't have this exact model (I have a Braun with identical features and design), this type of scale is not practical. Potential for poor technical accuracy aside, even if this model weighed perfectly, the round viewing sruface (dial spins around perimeter of scale), prevents you from obtaining an accurate read, since it is difficult to determine the precise viewing position... I'm buying a new scale right now..."
4,completly engrossing,"i found 'becoming anna' a non-stop read from the moment i picked it up. written between her 16th and 17th birthdays, the main content of her book details her time in two mental insititutions. the horror of what actually happens (she was in them in the early 90's) is hard reading. what she experienced, the failures of the mental health system and how children are treated is heart-breaking. in her epilogue she comments on her relief of finally being 18 as suddenly she had 'rights'. before she had no recourse to rebel against her (wrongful) incarceration, the instituions listen to who pays the bills-not who has to endure it. the falsity and cruelty of the staff at these places and the own terror of her abusive, neglectful family make it strong reading.i found this to be a beautifully written book for someone so young, detailing the pain of her short life."
5,awareness..,"I just want to say , fantastic ,in today society people need to pay attention with what goes on around them especially Woman,this book will help you to learn how to identify the good from the bad, because they are not a dying breed..Thanis to the Author ......"
4,Very good read!!,"The subject of psychopathy and narcissism has been explored in many books, some that I personally read, however this one is the most comprehensive and interesting thus far. Other books were either misleading or devoid of real explanation, at least to the extent the reader would fully apreciate and understand. This author literally goes out of his way to write in a manner conducive for average persons such as myself. I appreciate this book because of its compelling information and the way it is written, which is to say it is a real "" page turner"". I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in psychopathic and or sociopathic behavior. At the very most we might learn how to spot these people and better protect our money, happiness, and general well being. Thank you."
2,Hard information to apply to normal life,"Some good basic information, but clouded by the authors insistence that his checklist is ""the thing to use"". Author pats himself on the back a little too often. He refers repeatedly to a prison population making it hard to relate the information to other environments."
3,Hard on the eyes,"The content is great. The typesetting is not so good. Parts of the book are in a dark shaded background and in a smaller font. These parts are supposed to be asides, or examples. They are great, but the poor contrast and small font make them a bit of a strain to read."
5,helped me,"WE all have people in our lives we have known with this issue.This book makes us finally understand we cant change anything,it is what it is. Kinda like an intervention in your mind. Ittakes the guilt away and gives understanding of YOU CANT CHANGE IT. Saving me alot of pain"
5,GREAT INSIGHT INTO HEARTLESS PEOPLE,"This book is great, it helps reveal the probability why people can be callous and heartless and not blink an eye. It's also important to recognize that ""many"" of the people that live, work around us are prone to have some of these characteristics, the prison population doesn't necessarily reflect ""all"" those that need to be imprisoned, many walk and talk with us throughout our lives. This book will help you to realize and recognize those red flags."
3,Alright,"Interesting topic, good research. The author is quite repetitive, though, which was a bit irritating.Decent book overall. Probably generally used for coursework and not leisurely reading."
5,Read this book before it's too late,"It's hard to add much value to the reviews that are already here, so my suggestion is that you read the rest of the reviews, especially the ones with stories in them. The VAST MAJORITY of psychopaths are NOT violent and will never be in the news. You will probably deal with at least one at least once in your life, and when you do it will drive you to the brink unless you understand what you're dealing with. I wish someone had put this book on my ""required reading"" list years ago, because it would have saved me from years of anxiety and questioning my own sanity. PLEASE for your own sake read this book."
3,"Good product for USB 2.0, not for 1.1","I am sure this is a great product, but unless you have USB 2.0 on your computer, you won't be able to utilize its true speed. On most computers, only USB 1.1 ports are installed. Using a USB 1.1 port like myself, the burning speeds were severely reduced to amlost 4x4x6x speed. The transfer rate using 1.1 USB is much smaller than that of USB 2.0. I am sure this will be a great product once I upgrade to the new technology. Please check your USB capabilities before you buy."
3,Almost the same as the best of jenny mccarthy,"Just a few different scenes than the best of Jenny Mccarthy, so dont buy both. But I say this is a good buy for J.M. fans."
5,Best Book I've Read So Far...,This book captures all the little things in life! I love it!!! :-) It tells a wonderful love story along with a tragic one (or three) mixed in. I enjoyed reading it very much and it kept me on the edge of my seat! I was very emotional while reading it (because of the ending) and strongly recomend this to all readers!
2,A disappointment,"""In a finely written novel of adventure and romance, K.M. Peyton presents an engaging cast of characters who choose not to be bound by convention.""--dust jacket, inside cover. That is what I expected when I started this book. There was adventure and romance, I'll admit. Peyton kept me reading, as I wanted to know the outcome of the novel.However, that was the only thing that kept me going. The characters were rather flat and convienient. Ben, for example, showed up when a big brother character was needed, but disappeared when he wasn't.Another difficulty I have with the book is Part One is told from Charlotte's (the main character) point of view, and Part Two is from a character outside of the group. This device can be engaging, and can cause the reader to consider multiple points of view. In Snowfall, however, it falls flat and is not satisfactory."
4,Snowfall,"Most people say this book is absolute rubbish, but have they ever tried to review it from a different point of view? Okay, so it seems like a waste of time because it foreshadows too much, or the characters aren't 'real', but sometimes people actually WANT to read books like that. Have those people ever thought of that??I read it when I was 11, and I thought it was extremely good, and so did my friends. Okay, so eleven year olds are hardly the best literary critics, but now that I am older I can still find interest in it. I personally think it is in a genre that I like to call 'light reading', meaning that once I finish things like Wild Swans and War and Peace, I can still find time for silly, romantic stories such as this one. I mean, hasn't ANYONE got a book they ALWAYS want to re-read, no matter how silly or stupid it is?I think that people should actually look at it from a NORMAL person's point of view, before jumping their ship suddenly and labelling it as badly written and useless."
2,big disappointment,"We did not like the fact that they introduced several different languages, and it did not keep our baby's attention as other baby einstein DVDs. Although there may be studies that show babies can learn different languages if introduced early, that was not our intention when buying the DVD. It seems to me this just could cause confusion."
1,More English please!!!,"I thought this would be a great DVD for my 5 month old son. He sometimes likes a DVD to entertain him and us.The video spends way too much time on foreign languages, and not enough English. I would like my son to learn a foreign language, but after he masters English.He is not even speaking English yet, I do not need him watching a DVD with more German, French, and Spanish in it."
5,Hank is going to love it,Baby's First Sounds: Discoveries for Little EarsMilo already loves this and Hank is going to love it too
1,Terrible- Don't buy this dvd,"It spends way too much time on foreign languages and not enough time on baby's first sounds. If you are going to do foreign languages, make sure to have a seperate track option. Keep english to english track, spanish to spanish, chinese to chinese track. Do not put them all together!!!"
5,Simply Fun,"My 15 month child who hasn't been exposed to too much TV, loves this. It is simple and well paced for little ones. The visuals are a great mix of puppets, real footage etc...I think that children at different age absorb information at different speeds and this one was perfect for her age. She laughs, tries to sing and repeats sounds."
3,Be Advised These Are Only 1/2 Sheets,"Good sandpaper, but these are not full sheets.These are 1/2 sheets, so they cost me twice as much as I expected."
4,Engaging Anthology Featuring Many Perspectives,"As a high school English teacher, I looked through many anthologies of multicultural American literature for materials to consider for a college-prep American Literature course I teach, particularly for a unit on Contemporary American Voices. This anthology presents a variety of literature featuring a wide array of perspectives and experiences. I found this to be the most useful anthology of those I purchased and reviewed. I ordered a second copy for my student teacher, believing it to be an invaluable tool for a starting English teacher. Well worth the cost."
5,Great Pen,"I've honestly used this pen a bunch of times in the past but I always lost them. I just received my new one and they are consistently great to use. Obviously from the reviews you could tell that its a great pen. All I can say is if you're THINKING about ordering it, then DO IT because you won't be disappointed. They sell refills for it at CVS, walgreens and stop and shop I believe."
5,Stones of Jerusalem,Book arrived quickly and in shape described. I am very satisfied with the seller. Thanks.
2,It was incredibly STUPID!,This book had a really pointless plot. It had a stupid ending and was really worthless. I recommend NOT buying this book. Stine is DEFINETLY not a romance writer.....
3,Corporate cost-cutting causes quality comedown,"Some pennypinching person (or people) at Maxell (or its supplier) ruined a great 5-star product. In the past, these cases were superb and made in the United States. Over time, they were redesigned to be lighter in weight and more flimsy.The cases I received from Amazon in early 2011 were made in China and the material in the hinge area of each case is so thin that I will not be surprised when the first one breaks. I rate the product at 2.5 stars in the 2011 configuration but will round up to 3 stars since no cases have broken yet. However, I will buy a different product when I need new cases."
5,sbordr,Good product. Durable compared to the hard plastic square type of CD holders. Very slim so they don't take up much room.
2,If buying for an induction stovetop ....,"... this does not work. I have two other cast aluminium Biaglitti coffee makers and purchased this for use on an induction stovetop as the aluminium will not work. In spite of this item being labelled with the symbol for induction use, the base is too small to initiate the induction process on my Smeg cooking surface. If this is a reason for purchasing this coffee maker, I do recommend it as it absolutely will not work. I rate it 2 stars because I expect it will work OK on a gas or electric cooktop but otherwise it is not as advertised."
2,Scorched finish,"I bought this because I loved the looks. I have several Bialetti products and they make great espresso. However, the first time I used it the finish on the water container bottom scorched into an ugly yellow brown discoloration. Have a Viking range with normal size gas burners. I have been unable to remove the scorching no matter what I try. I think I will try to return it. Be aware."
3,Not so great,"I've owned several stove top espresso machines. I find this one is hard to screw closed properly and therefore doesn't make a full pop of coffee. The coffee it makes is okay, but not wonderful."
1,venus stove top espesso,Dont waste your time. I bought it and it didnt work from the first pot. The threads never lined up like they should and the rubber seal was to small. Bad espresso pot.
2,Looks nice but handle is fragile,"I bought this stovetop espresso maker because it has a nice look to it. It works well and makes good coffee but the handle is spot welded to the canister. You need to be really careful not to torque any part of the handle when screwing and unscrewing the canister from the base. I got about 2 months of use out of this before the handle broke off.This will probably sound like a complaint but it's just intended to provide information: The 4-cup stovetop espresso maker doesn't make as much espresso as I had hoped, meaning I needed to make 2 batches so there was enough for 2 people. After the handle broke off, I replaced it with aBialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker. This unit is sturdier and makes about 4 shots of espresso - win/win!"
4,A Great Guide to Surfing,"I've only gone surfing a couple of times, but Surf Like a Girl got me totally exctied to get out there more! It's really a fun read with lots of great tips and infor for every level of surfer girl."
4,A Left-hander's perspective,"Overall, these pens are very nice: they provide a bold line and smooth writing without smearing, which is very beneficial. My only complaint is that the grip is not as comfortable as it could be, although this is a very minor problem.I will definitely be repurchasing!"
5,The New Standard for Political Books,"In a previous review, I noted that ""The Boys on the Bus"" set the standard for political books. What It Takes exceeded that standard, and set a new one.In this reporting of the 1988 Presidential election, Richard Ben Cramer presents THE authoritative review and analysis of the candidates, the nominee, and the eventual president.This book is not for the faint of heart. At over 1000 pages, this book makes ""Truman"" seem like a Cliff's Notes review of a presidency.What the length does provide is ubelievable insight into what made the candidates tick, and why they were successful, or unsuccessful, in conveying their story and message to the American people.For those who want to know, this is the one book to read."
5,Best Politcal Book Ever!,"Cramer's research and insights are impeccable. Frequent flashbacks are a bit disconcerting in what amounts essentially to a joint biography of six significant late 20th century political figures and the business of politics. Cramer's literary device of writing through the imagined thoughts of the principals is compelling. I know Mike Dukakis and Cramer has him absolutely cold. The Bush and Dole portrayals also comport with what I have learned about them elsewhere. Ii't fair to assume then that Cramer also ""gets"" Hart and Gephardt and, still significantly, Joe Biden. I am a political history buff. This is the best book I have read on the subject EVER, supplanting (in my eyes) ""The Making of the President - 1960."""
3,Just ok,"I like Lupin so I wouldn't miss a movie. This one has all the basic plot points covered yet again. Nothing new, Lupin's dead yet again, Fujiko rips off the team, yet again.Truthfully if you miss this one you aren't any worse off. Everything felt half hearted, including the ending. There isn't really any fan service in this movie. While never needed for the story, it was still a slight disappointment. Likewise the music, which is normally a highlight for me, was mundane at best.If your looking for a ""off into the sunset"" movie where things get wrapped up, this is not it for the series. I doubt they will ever do that for Lupin.The voice acting itself, (English dub) was on par with recent Funimation Lupin movies, nothing great but ok.If you're a fan, buy it cheap, if not pass it up."
5,Good Song,"I like her voice and the harmony in the song. The song has a very good tune. I only download free songs I really like. They can't be just so, so. This one is very much my music type."
2,Less than moderate,"Very interesting subject, but pretty dull book. Too much irrelevant storytelling. Little or no original research, lots of 'some people say that...' Not very well structured (the last 100 pages seem to contain all sorts of stuff the author didn't know what to do with). Pretty expensive too, for a BW book made of (almost)... paper.After I finished it, I felt this was no good value for my money. A disappointment.On the other hand, for those who do not know anything about crop circles, the book may contain useful information. Still, I would rather recommend a book like ""Vital Signs, A Complete Guide to the Crop Circle Mystery and Why it is NOT a Hoax"" by Andy Thomas."
4,I like this mill a lot,"I have this mill and it works really well. I use it to make pear and apple butter, tomato sauce, jellies, etc. It fits very well on plastic bowls without slipping and sliding much. Even my 3 year old can turn the handle!!However, if you are doing tons of sauces, etc. you will want a heavier duty one, or an electric."
5,GREAT book!,Bryan Rosner created a wonderful resource for those suffering with Lyme Disease. This book is full of great information for using a Rife Machine for the treatment of Lyme.
1,These are NOT 0.2mm!!!,I had bought these twice because the first time I got 0.5mm. The 2nd time I also got 0.5mm. Which lead me to believe it is a typo or maybe I am just very unlucky. Very misleading as I bought these because it said 0.2mm. THESE ARE 0.5mm. If anyone got 0.2mm please let me know. I will call amazon to correct this mistake.
3,"The movie wasnt all that great, this is what i came up with","In this drama set in Ireland in the 1930s, Mark Doran (Matt Keeslar) is a young man who has grown up on a cattle farm and has fallen in love with lovely Annie Mullaney (Nancy St. Alban). However, Annie's father Fergus (Patrick Bergin) regards Mark as a callow youth and insists that he prove his manhood before Mark can ask for his daughter's hand in marriage. Mark sees an opportunity to prove himself and help his family at the same time when he becomes angry with the low prices offered by a local cattle broker; Mark decides that he will instead drive his herd 40 miles to the next available market, where's he's sure that they will bring in more money. Mark sets out to play cowboy with his rough-and-tumble Aunt Maeve (Brenda Fricker) in tow, but they soon run into interference from angry ranchers unhappy with Mark's stunt."
2,Not very sensual.,"Wife and I watched this video together. The actor/actress are very attractive, but very 80's in the way of body style. The love scenes were very short. Many scenes made us laugh, though it was supposed to be serious and not a comedy. Do not waste money on this video in hopes of making spark."
1,Totally Bogus,This is not an 8000+ word article on die design principles. What you get is a one-page general information sheet about a seminar that was put on in back May 2000.I'm sure that Amazon is not aware of what this really is once it is downloaded.Now I just need to figure out how to get my money back.
2,Not great,This is more of a supplement than a true Guide to learning Italian. A good dictionary is required to use this book.
4,Great Text Book!!!!,"This is as good as a text book gets. So why not 5 stars, because you can get a good Italian basics down from a book but you cannot learn the language unless you get immersed in it. You need to take classes or get a rally good audio course like pimsleurs. So get this as one step in our learning but not the only step."
3,NOT ON A KINDLE!,"I purchased this as a kindle book. I think the book is a great resource, but not very workable on the Kindle. It has many tables and they are very difficult to read on the Kindle. Although you can adjust the text size on a kindle, it does not work with the tables in this book. Also, the exercises require you to go to the appendix to check answers. It is very tedious to ""flip"" between the chapter of the book and appendix. I have seen other workbooks which seem to be more interactive and better for the Kindle. Suggest buying this book in hardcopy only."
4,Mystery Solved,"I purchased the tape because I was very courious as to what actually went on in those Funeral Homes. THis tape is very good. It outlines the procedure step by step, and personally, it reminds me of my Anatomy class when they spoke about the veins and arteries. I urge anyone who is courious just as i was to purchase the tape. I wish there were others that would actually go further with the preparation, ie: dressing and the transport of the body after it was embalmed. If anyone know of any other tapes available, please post.. thanks"
3,buy just the espresso maker,"the coffee maker is easy to use and makes delicious espresso. the milk frother, however, leaks milk out every time i shake it."
5,Great Product,Recommend buying the 6 oz pot and frother. Liked it so much decided to purchase another pot so we could make 2 larger cups and more for entertaining. Made two pots using garbage coffee and dumped them. It seasons the pot. Then use for normal drinking. Highly recommend the frother as it works very well. The more you work the frother the creamer it gets. We use coffee mate italian creamer in it and works great.
4,Great for the price,The case on these is pretty crappy and the first thing I had to do was glue the magnetic strips to the case so everything didn't fall out. I also had to run duct tape along the hinge side within a week. That being said the handles and blades in this set are fine so if you can handle the crappy case you get a lot for your money.
5,Well-Designed Space Saving CD Storage System,"I've been using the CD Projects sleeves for a few years. The original sleeves were clear plastic throughout, and did put small scratches on many of my CD's (all of which are still playable, though). I'm in the process of switching to Bubblesleeves, in which the centre part of the sleeve is a softer material with raised bumps, between which tiny dust specks fall so that they aren't scraping against the CD surface. So far, so good. Highly recommended. BTW, the amazon.com price is the same as anywhere else I've seen the Bubblesleeves for sale, and there aren't many places that sell them."
5,Accurate and sensual review of Indian Islamic Architecture,Moving from the Mamluk period through to the nineteenth century this accurate and beautifully illustrated book leads one through the complex history of Islamic architecture in India. I am envious of Frederico Borromeo's camera work for the sites have a freshness about them which is very difficult to capture on film. A little more on the influences of Central Asia and Iran would have been liked in the introduction but this is minor compared to the detail found in the remainder of the book. Some sites are not marked on the map and so more detailed maps would help in a second edition. Well done!
1,Boring for adult cats,This toy seemed like a good idea (and probably is for kittens) but my adult cats thought it was really boring and they refused to play with it at all.
3,cute but won't hold up too long,i thought this was the one with the fishing pole but i was wrong. it is a cute little fish and the cats are enjoying destroying it.
3,Love and Action for a pleasant evening at home,"A movie for an evening at home -- not a great movie, but paced and plotted so that the tape will probably play to the end, with noone being bored -- a predictable end, but one would not expect heavy drama or deep tragedy from this comedy/action/romance film. The cast is talented and do well with their roles; Courtney Vance emits his usual likeable screen personnae and is as convincing when wielding a gun as he is when kissing his girl, well played by Regina King and the chemistry between Vance and King is believable. Jason Alexander and Regina King perform a cute dance scene. The confession in the church is one instance when the humor has an original note. You may not hold your breath at the suspense ending but will probably keep your eyes on the screen. All in all, a good one for a dinner and a movie evening."
4,Great movie,Movie regarding a budding relationship. Regina King tries hard to win him over. Tough guy finally breaks down for love. Courtney trades one lifestyle for a better one.
3,Eva 01,"Good toy,excellent built and great details, good package but the manual is in japanese!!! I will buy all the Eva's soon."
2,67 camaro th400 crossmember,Although this part looks like a direct replacment it does reguire modifications that require some mechanical apptitude. The holes for the frame dont match the x-member and must be redrilled. Also mount must be shimmed up to prevent trans pan from resting on the X-member.
5,"The ""hottest"" Motian trio record","All the albums by this band are good, but this is the most ferocious. Try the title tune and ""The Storyteller""--wow."
3,speakers,"I bought these speakers because I own the 5"" ones. They're just ok because I had to repair one when I first received them, thanks!"
2,I wish I would have read for about the product before I bought it...,"I ordered this for my three and two year old, but didn't do a good enough job reading about the product. It is porcelain and obviously not made for young ones. It's cute looking though, but made for an older girl who can be responsible with type of toy. The basket is nice and can hold more than just the tea set it provides, but if you didn't fill the basket with padded items I would be afraid that the tea set would break when you carried it around. The napkins and table cloth inside are small, but my girls like it and just play with them and the basket."
1,CHEAP QUALITY,"don't buy this. it is too cheap looking. color of the porcelain tea set is DULL, DULL, DULL greyish/blue. Not an attractive looking tea set AT ALL."
1,Waste of time money,"Got the kit, tested it right away by following the instruction, it reads 0ppm iron. Dosed iron liquid fertilizer, the reading still remains 0ppm. Don't waste your time and money on this kit. Gonna throw this garbage away and try Seachem iron test kit."
4,Introduces readers to other multicultural families,"Erica Howard and Nancy Hong are best friends at school. They play and eat together. Nancy invites Erica over to her home for a playdate. Nancy Hing lives in a old townhouse over a laundry/dry cleaning shop (the author's grandparents had a laundry in the DC area many decades ago). Erica is introduced to Nancy's mother, grandmother (PoPo) and grandfather (Gung Gung). ""Ni hao?"", grandfather greets them. PoPo serves them almond cookies and sweet dragon well tea. Nancy shows Erica the family altar and then plays a tune on her Gu Zheng (Chinese zither). Then Gung Gung takes them to the park where they can play under his dozing gaze. The playdate ends with a walk home, but there is a reminder of the afternoon in a brown paper bag."
3,Not great,"Despite the enthusiasm with which High School students appraoch this story about a man turned into a giant bug, it is not a very compelling story. It is, I suppose, of some literary merit, however, it is not very entertaining."
2,Just does not work well.,"I have one of the old Peterson mechanical wheel strobe tuners -- it is absolutely great. But I am very disappointed with this tuner from the same company. The microphone is insensitive. The display is very often ambiguous -- you can't tell whether the marks are drifting up or down. Just plain bad. After putting it away for two years, today I gave it another try -- same thing as two years ago. I'd sell it for a dollar. By the way, I suspect it's not a real strobe tuner. Here's why. With the good old mechanical wheel tuner, the octave bands drift relative to each other because any string has some degree of falseness. But the bands in this electronic version do not -- very suspicious. If you want a strobe tuner and don't need portability, get the mechanical-wheel version from the same company -- it's a gem in the world of tuners, and I have a good collection of them."
3,Peterson VSam,"Seller sent me a VS-II by mistake, so I had to return item and got V-Sam from Musician's Friend. I am pleased with the product and use it often. I liked it so much, I opted to get a 490-ST for studio. Peterson products are excellent...the standard for tuning."
3,"Much more comfortable grip, but the clip is easily bent","I use Pilot G2 disposable pens all the time, and I was excited to try out this new casing for them. It worked quite nicely for a month or so, but then I bumped it against a desk, bending the clip. Unfortunately, I've been unable to bend it cleanly back. For the disposables, breaking the clip is no big deal since they only last a month or so anyway before I run out of ink, but I was hoping to have this one last significantly longer."
2,Basic info on Hoffman,"This biography is not as much a biography as a review of interviews made to Hoffman and reviews of Hoffman's movies (too bad there isn't one single word from critic-guru Pauline Kael). In fact, I didn't see much research here, the author never gets in one single day in Dustin's life with phrases such as ""in 1967 he made this play and this movie and got these reviews"". (And this book ends in 1984, with 'Tootsie'.) Certainly, it must be difficult to get into Hoffman's life, friends and relatives but this book doesn't seem to have tried that at all. The resolution of the pictures is like a xerox copy (this book is a reprint)."
3,Fell apart after a few months,Got this for our kitchen; we do most things fresh so we wanted a grater that could take the abuse.Pro: Large face; able to work fast and it has multiple options. Very sharp.Cons: the black part popped off the top of the grater; we had to glue it back on twice. It appears the plastic around the screw holding it failed.I actually like this grater. I just can’t give a 4 star review because it fell apart so quickly.
3,A little Too Small,"This is a great product except that it was a bit smaller than I expected. I read all of the reviews and tried to measure it, but when I received the soup pot, I realized how close the size was to my other Le Creuset pan. Unfortunately, it just wasn't worth it to pay for the return shipping and fees back to Amazon, so I just kept it. Hopefully I will be able to make some use out of it, but I end up using my Le Creuset 3.5 casserole pan much more since they are so similar in size."
5,A great piece of cookware.,"I just purchased this Soup Pot as my first piece of Le Creuset. I had never used it before, but had adored it for a long time. It is beautiful and cooks very well. I've found it takes a little getting used to the enamel, as I've had a couple things stick a bit, however it cleans up like a dream. Enjoy!"
2,Rad book cover! It covers up the lameness of what's inside!,"Well, I thought the titles of their ""art"" films were totally funny. That, and death by sushi. Otherwise, this book was a phat bore. It suffers from saggy-middle syndrome. I read this on a plane. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for easing me into the warm embrace of sleep!"
1,Reader in San Francisco,"Being a professor at UCLA, I expected a lot more from Richard Walter. The sad truth is this book lacks a lot. There are some funny lines and quirky scenes but in the all I found it almost annoying. There are no characters I like nor any that are believable. The plot is flat and in the end I questioned what the book was even about. Maybe some people do care about the hollywood scene and what it's like to be a ""writer,"" but I think even those folks are going to expect more from this novel than it offers."
1,"Cheap, stamped metal, garbage.","Don't waste your money on this. It's a mesh net, which is fine in itself, but the expanding frame is poorly fabricated cheap aluminum that twists out of level easily and is poorly joined to the basket to begin with. If you're serious in the kitchen this won't last you a month. Look elsewhere."
2,not so good,"OK but took it back after one use. I used it to make mashed potatoes. Even though I had only a small amount of potaotes in the mill, they kept being pushed to the top and spilling over. I had to turn the handle several times back and forth before the food would actually go throught the holes in the plate."
1,Don't bother - this is useless,"This definitely doesn't work as a food mill. The blade pushes the food around and around but not through bottom of the mill. I tried this with tomatoes and with RIPE American persimmons. Anyone who has used tomatoes and American persimmons knows how soft they are and these items should easily push through the holes in the bottom, right? Wrong. Instead of pushing the food through the bottom blade, the ""paddle"" part just pushes the food around. I took this back and bought a Foley here on Amazon."
4,shelf organizer,"Works pretty good. Makes finding things in the cabinet easier. However, make sure to line it up with your cabinet shelves. I put shorter items in the bottom shelf or I cannot clear the shelf. Only improvement I see needed is a little more distance between the shelves allowing for taller items."
4,handy spice rack,Handy item and fits great in my kitchen (bought two of these). The screws that came with them are too small and it's pretty hard to secure the racks to the wall with those screws (I'll be looking for bigger ones in a hardware store). I wish the space between top and bottom tiers was just a tad bit larger because many of my spice bottles would not fit in there. But overall reasonably well made and does what it's supposed to.
2,Disappointed,"Warning -- that hot brunette babe on the cover is in the video, but she never does get naked. Most of the scenes are recycled from Women of South Beach or Women of Color episodes which aired on Playboy TV. Still not bad, but not much new here."
2,"The Duplicate, a Disappointment",I was not impressed by this book at all. Nothing ever seemed to go as planned for main character David. Frustration is produced thoughout this book and only the final two chapters are interesting. It is very unrealistic and not eloquently written. I am not aware of anyone who would duplicate themselves just for a girl with out realizing the future consequenses. This book was an immense disappointment.
2,The Duplicate,"It was so stupid! The author could have made it a great book. Too much detail, the story was bland, people swore. If this book was a movie, it would be PG-13. Who in their right mind would make a clone of themselves. In the action department I would give it a 2, Suspense 1. Overall, a dumb book. I hope this review was helpful. I wouldn't waste my money...."
4,Read this,"David is teenager who thinks his problems are over when he finds a machine on the beach. This machine is different from others because it can create duplicates of living organisms. When David discovers the machine's power, he thinks that his problems are solved. When he makes a duplicate of himself, he can be in two places at once. He can be out on a date, while the duplicate is going to his grandma's house. But the duplicate has a mind of it's own. The duplicate finds a hideout, in an abandoned World War 2 outpost. The real David finds traps hidden inside and thinks that the duplicate is trying to kill him. But the duplicate has duplicated himself, and the duplicates want to get rid of the real David.... This book really gives out a strong message that you should think before you act. Think out all of the consequences before you do something."
5,The Duplicate is the Best Book Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Duplicate is an awesome book. I absolutely loved it. It is full of suspense, which makes it very exciting. I couldn't stop reading it. Every time I want to stop, I can't because I want to find out what's going to happen next.The Duplicate is about a boy who makes a copy of himself, so he can go to two places at once. However, that causes problems because they can't let anyone find out about them. They find a hideout where one of them could stay and the other could go to school. One day, the original finds another duplicate, and that means even more problems. The two duplicates fight, but you have to read the book to find out what happens after the battle.Overall, The Duplicate is an amazing book. I would reccomend this book to people of all ages. I beleive that everyone should enjoy this book.By Tom I."
4,Good deal,"Was just what I was looking for. Had one on my old boat and it worked great. Have keen looking around for one, and was happy to find it."
1,Did not fit CrossPen,"Although it looks like a Cross Pen refill, the threads don't fit so it can not be used."
3,Not reliable enough for my CD and DVDs,"In theory, this should work. Sand out the scratches. It dulls the surface, but since the lasers in players focus past that it shouldn't matter.Except that it doesn't *quite* reach the edge of the disc, and some players have trouble dealing with that. And the dull discs look terrible. And it's cheap plastic, not particularly precisely made.A few of my CDs were repaired, one was rendered unplayable. All looked like I had run sandpaper over them (gee, wonder why!).It's not the worst device ever, but I've decided that a safer, better, and cheaper alternative is to use htpp://www.skippydisc.com, a professional cd resurfacing service."
2,"Works great, if you want to waste time spinning the wheel","Got this product today, tried it out, and it worked fine....instructions state that the cd should make 1 full revolution, and that it moves slowly....that is the biggest understatement ever. It takes about 25 minutes to repair a disc, and that is if you are furiously cranking the lever. The end result does work. Fixed one of my NIN cds, but I sent it back. I'm not exactly a busy man, but paying 30 bux to spend 20 minutes cranking this wheel is not a good deal. Splurge for the Electric version, unless your right arm needs a workout."
1,"Before you spend your money, try this helpful hint.........","PEANUT BUTTER! That's right, folks, I said peanut butter. I have a seven year old son who has managed to scratch up many of the Playstation 1 discs he has inherited from me. Yes, it's messy but it really works. Just rub creamy PB into the disc and buff it off. (you may have to buff 3 or 4 times to eliminate all the residue.) I have tried this on audio cds as well with positive results. P.S. I have not tried this on dvds and I would not suggest it, they are more fragile than the others."
4,Does exactly what the name implies,"I've been using the SkipDoctor products since they were first released. Some CDs are simply too far gone, but the majority of discs can be repaired to a readable state (assuming your player isn't overly sensitive). The biggest problem with the manual product is that it takes quite a while to rotate the disc through the course of the polishing. Your arm will get tired, but the result is usually worth it. I wouldn't use it on a disc that doesn't have any problems, but if you're trying to salvage something (or at least buy yourself enough time to rip or copy it), this product is a great last-ditch effort."
1,Worst Product Ever!!!,"I used this product once and only once...I had a minimally scratched DVD and when I used the Skip Dr. to fix it...it made it much, much worse. I followed the directions perfectly, but the resurfacing wheel, on the first try, left an unremovable film and hundreds of marks of the DVD surface...needless to say it is ruined...I would never, ever buy another product from this company again!"
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK! RUINS YOUR DVD'S AND CD'S","DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... BOUGHT IT FOR 29.99 AND SHOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR A PENNY... TRIED IT ON BOTH CD'S AND DVD'S AND NOT ONLY DOESN'T IT TAKE ANYTHING OUT, BUT THE BUFFING CLOTH LEAVES A FILM ON THE SURFACE WHICH DOESN'T COME OFF.. THE ONLY SUGGESTION I CAN MAKE TO THOSE WHO HAVE AND USE DVD'S AND CD'S, BE MORE CAREFUL, HANDLE BETTER AND HOLD THEM WITH THE WHOLE IN THE MIDDLE. BE MORE CAREFUL PUTTING THE DVD AND CD INTO ITS CASE AND YOU WILL AVOID MOST SCRATCHES. NOW THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS TO GET THE MANUFACTURERS OF THESE DVD AND CD CASES TO MAKE CASES WHERE YOU DON'T NEED SOME PLYER TO GET THE...THING OUT OF THE CASE WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO SOME SCRATCHING..PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY... SKIP DOCTOR MANUAL VERSION OR MOTORIZED IS NOTHING BUT JUNK AND WILL RUIN YOUR ELECTRONIC ACCESSORIES THAT WE ALL SPEND A FORTUNE FOR...WILL BE RETURNING MINE TO THE STORE AS FAST AS I CAN... BUYER BEWARE!!!"
4,Taut thriller,"Through a convoluted but fascinating series of events, the chief editor (Ray Milland) and the publisher (Charles Laughton) of the nation's top crime magazine find themselves on opposite sides of a murder. Both of them have some information about what happened that fateful night, both of them are trying to learn more, and both of them have a great to lose if their part of it becomes public...This is the type of film Hitchcock excelled at--an innocent man trying to clear his name. Director John Farrow doesn't have the master's touch, but he doesn't let his talented cast down. Elsa Lanchester also does great work in a comic supporting role as an eccentric artist. Look for MASH's Harry Morgan in an early role as a heavy."
2,The Big Snooze,"The basic premise of this is a good one, a crime editor racing to solve a murder where the clues all point to him. Too bad this film fails in the execution of this premise. The direction seems stilted, the delivery by the actors is so bland. The only performer who distinguishes themself here is Elsa Lanchester as the eccentric artist. It may be sacrilege, but the remake of this film, ""No Way Out"" is far superior to the original. It was sexually charged (impossible for production code days) and had your heart racing throughout the various plot machinations."
3,More suspense than stylish noir,"If it didn't gain notoriety on its own, mthen a little-known Hollywood noir movie such as this serves its purpose as providing a brilliant plot for a later blockbuster remake. In this case, it's 1987's 'No Way Out.' This version starts out a litle slow as a patient camera saddles the viewer with elements and knowledge needed to stay on the caught-in-the-middle protagonist George Stroud, played by Ray Milland. It's worth it, because the suspense in the latter half is well-executed, although the only noir element is in the film's plot of a man wrongly accused of murder because of details and webs of deceit beyond his control. The cinematography is plain and straightforward -- nothing stylish at all."
5,sharpens even the dullest knives,"After trying several knife sharpeners bought from local Bed Bath store, settled on this sharpener bought from Amazon. I cannot say enough about the quality of the sharpener. After only a dozen swipes, all my knives are sharp enough to slice paper while hand holding.Warning: Your knife will be VERY sharp after using this. My wife had to bleed a few times before realizing how much sharper the old knives were. So, learn from others mistakes and respect this sharpener!"
4,Simple but effective,I am very satisfied with this sharpener which is reasonably priced and simple to use. I would recommend to others.
5,So glad I bought this!,I never knew how much I would appreciate this little sharpener until I started using it. It has become an important part of my kitchen routine in just a few short weeks. Quickly puts a nice edge on all those knives I was thinking needed professional sharpening. Comfortable to grasp and nice enough to leave out on the counter for instant access. I'll think I'll buy one for my daughter--it's such a pleasure to have sharp knives.
5,Works Great,My husband had me get this because our knives were getting dull and the normal sharpener didn't seem to be doing the trick. Works great and super quick and easy.
5,Excellent Knife Sharpener,"This knife sharpener is an excellent product to use, if you use it correctly. I ""HAD"" several old knives that were as dull as dull could be from decades of use. Most required five pulls through #1, and four to fives pulls through #2. Yet when they came out of the sharpener, they are as sharp as I had hoped. Also it literally only took seconds to sharpen each knife. I insert the blade into the sharpener as vertical as I can, and pull the blade through slowly, I get the best results. This seems to resolve all the problems others have reported, at least for me. Are the knives factory sharp? By no means are they. Yet the knives are sharp enough to do what they were designed to do, CUT safely. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who would use it correctly."
5,Sharp Knives,We own a set of J.A. Henckels knives and they had been getting pretty dull over the last 3 years. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! It is easy to work and our knives are back to like new condition!
1,I hate this grater (sorry) but there are better ones here,"This grater looks sturdy and it is. It WILL grate your cheese. But it is clunky, hard to turn and kind of kludgey to put together (the bin on top flaps around as you struggle to insert the grating drum.)While it DOES work, I have to say I prefer the plastic Zyliss. It is a lot more comfortable. And even nicer is a food processor. So skip this one and go on to better things."
4,To an American artist the title appears totally misleading.,"The text is translated from ""Dutch"".... To get to the point, the following words from the preface, ""... the iconographic traditions with which we are concerned here."" reveal the fact that the book is concerned with explaining the stories which can be found in the subject matter of the works. While the individual artists were very much involved with their intuitive as well as learned aesthetic norms, the probably often illiterate viewer took in the biblical or mythological stories portrayed in the works. And to some extent were affected by the aesthetics and impressed by the craftsmanship. There is minimal mention of aesthtics and none of craft, I think.The book is an excellent source of images from a great number of museums and other locations. Images which very few will get to see in the original.In my, M.F.A.d mind ""reading a painting"" involves fathoming its aesthtics."
5,exellent,"Exellent for russian speakers, easy to use, not so many different meaning for one word which sometimes confuse me even more. English speakers have to know kirilic to use this book."
3,It Works,"This works, but the seat can still be lifted a few inches and it seems like a strong toddler might be able to break it by pushing up on the seat really hard."
3,works for now...,This lock was easy to install and works for now for my 18 month old. I will say that it seems extremely flimsy and I'm fully expecting my son to be able to break it eventually. I just hope by then he's old enough not to be fascinated with the toilet!
1,I don't see how it could ever work,My one year old had no trouble figuring it out. It's neither sturdy nor intelligent in its design. I could not recommend it for the purpose it's being sold.
3,Tough to use,"It is effective, but it can be more difficult to use than some other options.Its use isn't intuitive - we had some workmen in our place for a few days and they just muscled the toilet lid up, breaking the adhesive (but not the device or the toilet). I know, they shouldn't have done this, but desperate times called for desperate measures...My wife also thinks its location on the rim near the front edge is ""icky""Safety First has a model that mounts in the rear center top of the toilet lid and pushed against the tank - that one is much better."
1,dont waste your money,My 12 mo old son loves to get into the toilet. This device stopped him from opening the lid all the way but he could still open it up a few inches and get his little arm right into the water!
3,Tall rimmed toilets beware,"This product is easy to use and install although I usually had to use 2 hands to open it. This did not seem to be a big deal and it makes me think that a toddler would be unable to open it- my 18 month old certainly couldn't figure it out. My only major complaint is that the inner latch that secures it to the bowl did not extend far enough for my toilet. I used the larger extender and it would not even lock into the first ""click."" This resulted in that portion falling into the toilet and accidently getting flushed away. It would have been helpful if the information on then latch would have included measurements so that I would have known that it wouldn't fit my ""deep toilet."" If you have a tall rim on the inside of the toilet I would not recommend this lock."
2,Not great,We used this for about a week before the baby figured out if she slides it to the side of the toilet it pops right off. It did not stay in one place and had to be positioned directly on the front of the toilet rather than the side. That made it very inconvenient.
2,Make sure it fits before you buy.,"I purchased this to install on my toilets, but they don't fit.They are designed for toilets that have a square rim. If you have a toilet with a rounded rim, these will not stay on.As soon as the smallest amount of force is applied to open the lid, the lid-lok will fall right off the rim."
1,Piece of garbage!,"I used this steamer, just once, for asparagus. It came out great. However, the inside of the pot was stained after hand washing it with warm soap and water. Worse of all, the knob on the lid broke off! Very poor quality. Do not buy!"
4,Hot Guys- Beautiful girls- magic and fighting,"I started buying this series after my brother got me hooked on it. He's 4 years younger and HATES to read. so i was amazed when he started to want books instead of his usual CD's. Its a great series. Even i buy them..read them, then hand them over to my bro to read. We have some problems finding them all in the stores so its great to find them here. its pretty popular for the type of hype it gets from the kids my bro knows. im in love w/ all the characters. everyone is greatly expressed thru out the story lines. i wish there was a DVD series of it!"
4,The perfect graduation gift for him or her,"The obligatory gift for the student you don't know well but know you must give something nice. You are the aunt or uncle, parent's friend, or perhaps a boss. You don't have a lot of money but if you give this, it is nice enough to really let the student know you care and wish them well in their next adventure. Classy and traditional....the perfect gift for both sexes."
3,BROKEN WHEN RECEIVED....right out of the box,"The light kit that assembles on to the stand, would not work....and I needed it immediately so there was no way to return and get another! Luckily my husband is handy, when he took it apart to try to fix....the wires weren't even connected inside, the screws were missing! Really...an assembly issue all together....the assembly step got skipped!"
5,Good Deal!,"This is perfect for my needs. It gives me great lighting, it's relatively small and compact. It works and it is very inexpensive for what it does. I take pictures of small things and sometimes of food. I get a lot of natural light most of the time, but this gives me the ability to photograph better in dim lighting. For the price point, it's worth giving it a shot to determine whether it works for your needs."
3,"okay, but not enough watts","I wanted something that worked. Something that was inexpensive. Something that would let me experiment with studio lighting techniques. This product is all of that, but there's one big problem: it's not nearly bright enough. 26w fluorescent bulbs are, what, equal to a 100w incandescent bulb? That's not enough. You'll be using the window light and cranking your ISO up higher than you imagined necessary on a supposedly lighted shot.if you're excited about this product, I recommend spending another few bucks to get something with a little higher wattage."
3,Okay for the price,"When I received this item, I wanted to use it right away! It comes with the stand, the ""cheap"" umbrella, and a light bulb. Well, my light bulb did not work. I had to go out and buy an additional light bulb before I could test it out. For the price, it is okay. It takes away the shadows behind the object I am shooting, but I would not consider this if you are looking for a ""real professional umbrella."""
3,Photography studio umbrella,The umbrellas were fine for the price but one of the bulbs did not work. I have not been able to get a replacement yet.
2,Uncomplete,"Ordered two of them. One had an umbrella missing. I felt that was really annoying. Besides that, it is an ok product. Works as advertised. Returned one of them."
2,boo!,"A waste, a total waste. When I got my order the bulb was broken into pieces! Sure maybe it was the UPS fault but the packaging didn't have enough protection, no wonder the bulb broke!I had to drive far just to get another bulb and it even wasn't a 27watts!I won't buy again. I rather spent a little more money and get what I payed for."
1,Can not review,"I can not give a honest review of this item because as 11Oct2009 I have not recieved it.This item was ordered on 09Sep2009. I am told this item was shipped to Tampa, FL and wasundeliverable and was shipped back to the manufacterer. On 10Oct2009 I emailed to cancelthis order and request a refund because I have no idea what is happening now.This particular transaction just is not working for me.Maybe next time."
3,"Great Stand and Umbrella, BUT>>>>>>","I purchased this item and received it yesterday. The stand is far sturdier than a North Light product I purchased a few years ago. The assembly was easy, following the photo instructions. However, when I plugged it in, the ""free"" light bulb came on briefly and went off. When I tried to unscrew it, the top part of the light bulb came off in my hand - loosened from the base! I managed to screw it all back together, but it wouldn't light. I took it off again, and noticed the bottom of the bulb that screws in to the receptacle was badly damaged. It is bent out of shape and there is a huge dent on the contact part which is skewed crookedly inside the silver metal part. Fortunately I had ordered 3 more bulbs from Amazon which work fine! I am told there are no refunds or exchanges from this company. I won't order again from them"
3,"Nice in every way, but one.","This was my first purchased umbrella light. I followed the directions and assembled the light, leaving the light bulb for last. When I screwed in the light bulb there was a scratching sound, so I promptly unscrewed and examined it. Inside, there is a metal connector (or whatever you'd call it) that is bent upward preventing the light bulb to screw in properly. I have been unable to push it back down, and fear it may have to be taken completely apart to be fixed. I'm very disappointed that I will be unable to use this until I figure out if it's fixable or a lost cause. The light seems to be a good quality besides the aforementioned, lightweight, and adjustable in many ways. If it were not damaged, I would have given 5 stars."
4,Great Buy,"I bought this early this year, when I was getting interested in portrait photography. Although I haven't had a use for it in any of my shoots, It makes a great lamp lol. But it's high quality, and durable. So if you're looking for extra lights, then this would be a great fit."
2,Hard to Kill,I dont think this ablum is worth getting. Gucci mane is a hit maker not a abulm creator. this ablum is trash youd be better off buy one of his singles rather that wasting you money on it.
2,Junk,"""My Chain"" is the worst song I have heard in a few years ... Go get Nas ""Hip Hop Is Dead"" instead of this garbage."
4,In Defense if I may...,"ALL comedians 'take' or 'borrow' material and you would know this if you have watched years of stand up comedy! Yes Bill Hicks is certainly one of the best, but get over it! You can watch Bill religiously, remembering all his lines, and still not be able to make people laugh. Denis is a funny guy. His friends are funny guys. The roast is good entertainment for those that aren't offended or precious. It didn't rate it's arse off because everyone thinks Denis stole all his stuff from Hicks. No one cares obviously. Don't fear. Hicks memory is not being stomped on... and lets face it, imitation is the sincerest form of flatery, don't you think? This is a great show, top dvd and I had a good old laugh. Lighten up, have a smoke and knock back a beer. Life isn't to be taken too seriously!"
1,Surprising,"This is the most offensively bad book I have read in recent memory.I wanted to like it. I really did. Some of the fictional science themes hit points decades before their time and some of the asides did not revel in exacting pointlessness. However, the dialogue fails, almost taking pains to avoid any resemblance to actual human speech. Characters behave inconsistently. The science, even for the seventies, is very, painfully, soft. An undercurrent of pretentious political activism -- something akin to the inane mutterings of a burned out, hippie anarchist -- runs through most of the book, making for an unpleasant read.Considering the author's apparent notoriety and the book's apparent popularity, my incredibly negative experience really surprises me. As I am clearly in the minority, you can only trust my opinion so much, but please consider this. No book before or since came so close to convincing me that justification for the burning of books for their content exists."
2,cross refills ?,"Points were scratchy and not of cross quality !Wasted my time and cash !Five more words required, OK."
3,Work,Bought this for work and the product was just fine. Sent it off to a friend to be used for his jobs.
1,Rusted after the very first wash,"Stainless steel is not supposed to rust, but this strainer rusted at least 10% of the area after the first wash."
1,RUSTS TO easy stainless steel isnt supposed to Rust,all i have to say is it rusted out right away what a pile of crap Stainless steel isnt supposed to rust
5,"Buy This CD, NOW!","Absolutely hilarious! How did it take Greg Giraldo this long to get noticed? He's so funny. If you saw him on Dave Attell's ""Insomniac"" tour DVD, you'll love this. Actually you'll love this either way if you're not an idiot. Stop stalling and buy it! ha"
4,Nice video,This is a fun video to watch and dance to. Moves are pretty good and music is decent. The tall brunette is funny to watch too. She can't dance and has the funniest expressions. Overall recommend for a workout or for some unique moves.
1,waste of money,A waste of money! Not for anyone who has ever gone to a club and danced. There is nothing new to be learned from this DVD. Not sure where all the great reviews came from but this is seriously a waste of time and money. Definitely not for anyone from Miami!
3,Original Recording of at Least One Classic,"This disc has the original recording of ""The Little Drummer Boy."" Harry Simeone is even given writing credit for this song. I have fond memories of hearing this on LP when I was a child, as I had my first exposure to several carols and songs through this recording. As a trained musician,I have to conclude that some of the arrangements and orchestrations seem overdone and almost inappropriate for the musical material and text; nevertheless, it does have redeeming qualities. Some of the selections are not found on other readily available recordings. A musician and music collector will appreciate having such things as part of a recording library."
4,Portnoy's Liquid Drums...,"A must for all Dream Theater/Liquid Tension Experiment and of course Mike Portnoy fans. His fill and rhythmic concepts have be highlighted in his other features, but watching him play along songs from recent albums is just fun. The additional footage of concerts and project/band members makes this a 'best buy' for all fans. Sound: excellent although not DVD 5.1 standard. Footage: some VHS footage/bootlegs included, minor editing problems in transitions. Conclusions: If I didn't have a DVD I'd buy the VHS. Price: Could buy three motion pictures with 'real' DVD features worth the same. But if you are a fan...hope it helps."
2,Weak Entertainment and less Educational,"This DVD is okay if you just want to watch Mike Portnoy play the songs on the album, but it does not offer much more than an explanation of a few songs. I personally feel that Portony's playing is dynamically limited, and his bass drum chops are weak.For a great DVD for entertainment and great exercises to improve your chops, control and independence, I recommend Thomas Lang's Creative Control."
4,Grab it whilst you can,"This U.K. import, which took over 6 years to receive a full release, finally hits the States. Originally remixed in '97 it featured Ferry Corsten's Moonman mix. Unfortunately, that mix is absent from this CD, as is Cygnus X's original mix. What we do have, however, is a rather tasty remix from Bervoet & De Goejj, the Rank 1 boys, which sticks very closely to the Moonman mix, and the Solar Stone mix which gallops off into a lush trance soundscape. If you like Cygnus X, try hunting down their astounding remix of Art Of Trance's ""Madagascar"", an anthem here in the U.K. Also, their excellent new single ""Superstring"", also remixed by Rank 1, is well worth a listen."
2,Pretty Cheesy,"Recreating a song composed by a classical music composer (such as Beethoven) into an electronica tune sounds like a good idea in almost every instance, but I have yet to really find an example of this that has really worked. The Orange Theme, which is also the main theme from the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"", is just not very good. Granted, the Solar Stone remix is good trance, with a great build, but the main synth line is just not that good. It really isn't that catchy, and is just plain cheesy. There are better trance anthems out there that are worth owning in this format."
3,Too much whining!,"The book was about a family of women and the problems that they have to overcome- individually and as a family. The problem I had with this book that there was too much whining and not enough good things. I know that doesn't make sense but the characters were downers. They all had great things going for them but they didn't communicate enough with each other and in the end very little was resolved. The only character who I liked completely was Brent, a family friend who might (or might not) have a crush on the 22 year old. To be honest, it seemed like a set up for a sequel."
1,Not the best I've ever seen,"i have been a long time fan of Pamela Morsi and I found this book to be a huge disappointment. Her earlier work, the historical romances she did, were wonderful uplifting stories of people falling in love and coming to terms with who they were. I found this book negative and depressing. I hope Pamela Morsi returns to her usual good work"
2,I'm upset,"When I bought the DVD I thought I was going to see some of the desirable fantasies a man can have. And there are.But after watching it I deduced this movie was made for women instead of men, the fantasies seem made more for lesbians, the movie it's only 50 minutes long and the fantasies are too long. I think there are too many fantasies.I was dosappointed with the appear of Carmen Electra, every time she appears in a movie she looks like an innocent-shy-teen girl. And of course the song and the video are bad.Definitively, this isn't the best movie of Playboy."
2,poor knockoff,Cross refills aren't good anymore. The last three packages I bought either from amazon or from the store lasted me no more than two-weeks per refill. Cross must have moved production to a cheap manufacturing plant somewhere in the fourth world.
5,Used Cross Pens for 40 some years,"Nice permanent ink, no smear - My favorite writing pen and has been for more than 40 years.Does not leak."
4,JAHencels,"I like this product. the blades are very sharp and the handle fits my hand comfortably. The double blades make quick work of my herbs and spices. I would have liked to see the wood ""bowl"" be just a little deeper, but other than that it is working out great."
5,Excellent for herb chopping,"The Henckels 2-piece mincing set works great for fine chopping of herbs. It is the sharpest one I have seen. I agree with some of the reviews that state it is hard at times to distinguish the handle from the blade when you quickly pick it up, so you have to be very aware of this to ensure you don't grabe the sharp cutting blade end instead of the handle. I have been keeping mine in the lightweight cardboard sleeve that it came in. It would be helpful to have a good, strong plastic sleeve to put over the cutting blades. I haven't tried chopping nuts with this cutter, but think it would do a fantastic job."
2,mislabelled handle!,"First of all, the cups are just fine. Polished metal, I mean, they're measuring cups, so no big whoop.BUT: My 1 cup sized cup says 1/2 cup on the handle! The actual 1/2 cup cup also says 1/2 cup. If the cups are all on the ring, then you probably won't think twice, but if you or someone using them doesn't do enough cooking to notice something's fishy, they may mistake the 1 cup size for 1/2 cup. The handles are the same size so my guess is that the wrong handle was attached at the factory; these are not single-piece construction."
5,Lerv it,These work so well! I've always had plastic ones and they kept breaking so I finally upgraded and I don't regret it!
4,New Age with a Native American flair,"Sacred Spirit is a blend of orchestrals, nature sounds, NativeAmerican vocals and chants, all powered by the electronicbackgrounds that fans of Delerium and Enigma will like. It maytake a few listens to appreciate the complexity of this work.While tracks one through five are uplifting and contemplative,the mood becomes increasingly tribal and mystical after thispoint. One could wish for more female vocals with the soaring""wall of sound"" that New Age listeners crave."
3,Not as good as the first,"This cd isnt as good as the first album. To me it just doesnt have the same catch as far as the music goes as the first did. If you have the first album then you may or may not like this one, but if you dont have the first I recommend buying that one first."
5,Sacred Spirit does it again with second album...,"Sacred Spirit II has done it again. As with the first album, it combines traditional chants with modern music arrangments. It is an album that MUST accompany the first Sacred Spirit album. Anyone who loves Yeha-Noha (Wishes of Happiness and Prosperity) should listen to Yane-Heja-Hee, as it comes from the same chant source (Navajo Nation) and sounds similar to the first hit single. Dela Dela is a song that gives a beat and the cello and violin solos cry out for hope and dignity for ancient America. It is a very excellent album. I give it two thumbs up and I rated this cd 5 stars for it's beautiful music."
5,Sacred Spirit Native American Chants and Dances,"This music is incredibly spiritual, soft and soothing, and takes you away to a time and place on another plane. The CD will lighten your load after a particularly hard day. Beautifully done!"
2,Naw.,"I purchased this book together with the Middle East Atlas and would not have otherwise bought it. It has some facts, but more could be found just on the internet. It was okay, but I would not have bought it except it was attached to another book."
4,Fantastic initiation book,"For me that the only thing I almost knew about chess was moving its pieces this book has opened my eyes to a deeper comprehension of the game itself. From four basic principles (force, time, space and pawn structure) and on, the book gives you what I think is a good base to start playing this game in a serious way.You won't become a GreatMaster just reading this book, but as I said before, it is a good start."
3,remix,"I AM A BIG FAN OF SIMPLY RED.I MET HIM LAST NIGHT AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE MADE A REMIX OF ONE SONG OF THIS ALBUM -BLUE-. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND IT? BY THE WAY, GET READY FOR HIS NEW ALBUM...THIS COMING SEPTEMBER!"
3,"Nice to listen to, but a little airy-fairy","This is an album that very much rides on past successes, Mick Hucknall's voice, and absolutely fantastic production. Unfortunately that's about it - the lyrical genius of past albums hardly makes an appearance here, and most songs are airy-fairy love songs. The cover of ""The Air That I Breathe"" is good for what it is, but is not comparable with many better renditions. The only song I really love off this album is ""Night Nurse"" (a cover). As mentioned, the saving grace of this album is the best production I have heard in ages - the sound has depth and width and almost comes out to get you. Overall, a good effort, but not in the same league as Simply Red's other works.If you are new to Simply Red, an 80's and 90's pop band, you may want to check out their ""Best Of"" compilation first and make your move from there."
1,Cross Classic Century Ballpoint Pen is the worst pen I've ever owned!,"I ordered this pen by mistake .. I really meant to order the rolling pen, but bought this without trying it, and I HATE IT! It's truly the worst pen i've ever owned. I've tried the fine refill, the medium and now the broad, and they're all bad as far as I'm concerned.Funny thing is, is that I consider myself a 'pen snob' and this was a big mistake.I ordered a Parker not long afterwards and that is a far superior pen, but I'm stuck with this Cross pen that I'm TRYING to like, just because of the money wasted.I don't know where I've gone wrong other than getting the ball point instead of the roller ball.Please, stay away from the ball points. You can buy cheap stick pens that perform better.Can I give it zero stars?"
2,not good as it used to be,"I intended to purchase these items for two teachers of my daughter as a Christmas gift. After opening the box, I embarrassed to give it to them. I asked myself this is an authentic ""Cross"" pen. It is definitely not on the same quality as they used to be. Cross has moved manufacturing to China and Chinese made version is ....!!! My eldest sister used to give me one set of Cross pen and pencil after my graduation for the past 20 years. Until now, they are still nice in the box and my memory."
2,Not for SD cards,"These media card holders are the size of a compact flash card, which is approximately 1 5/8"" x 1 3/8"". The boxes are NOT the size of an SD card nor do they have the little plastic bits that would hold an SD card in the middle of the case. What I received is NOT the item in the picture. An SD card will rattle around inside these cases. If you have compact flash cards, these boxes are great. For anything smaller you will want another type of container."
2,Disappointed,"I liked my can opener at first, but only had it for about a year before it started being very hard to turn and recently began to slip and not cut the can in spots. I'll not get another one."
3,Absurdly expensive $338 for 328 pages of old book,"Ridiculously expensive dollar per page for this old book. Not worth it. The contents are now looking rather dated, and are readily available elsewhere at a far more reasonable cost."
3,dug deep,"Ursula under is historical and impressive, but I need more than one chapter to get attached to a character ... each story could have been a novel in itself, and it made me less attached to Ursula down the hole, not more. I can't feel characters pumping thru my veins when I've only known them for 50 pages.I was also put off by the amazing language abilities of a child so young! The two year-olds that I know don't talk like that ... but maybe they didn't have such amazing ancestors.Overall an enjoyable read for me but I haven't been able to rescue any long term meaning."
3,"Easy to install, works with Lenovo F40a",It is installed in my Lenovo laptop and the laptop now has some improvement in system responsiveness and the software runs much fluent on the laptop.
5,Easy install on Dell Inspiron 9400,I'm not ready to spring for a new laptop but my old Dell is sluggish with some of the new software so I decided to add this memory. I got the installation instructions online and it took appx 10 minutes. The computer recognized the new memory without any problems. It's still not blazing fast but it is better. It was a pleasant experience.
4,Shipped me a DIMM and not a SO-DIMM,"Received a DIMM and not a SO-DIMM. The label on the package was clearly affixed manually and covered what had been there. Didn't need to open the package as what I could see was clearly much longer than what would fit in the laptop. Sent it back for replacement. Hopefully, I will get the correct one and not another mis-labelled DIMM.Update: Got the right part and it has worked fine."
4,seems fine to me,"delivery in time, goods in perfect condition, no problems with installation, system recognises the upgrade"
1,BEWARE!,"It's probably a great product, but BEWARE this is a 1GBx2 kit NOT a 2GBx1 kit as is implied by the listing and picture. Crucial's website is more accurate, showing a photo of 2 pieces as well as listing the item as 1GBx2.If, like me, you want a single (2GBx1) piece, DO NOT order this item."
2,not the part I needed - this is for a lap top and not desk top,Can't use this had to return it - wasn't for a desk top it was for a lap top so waiting on the credit to order the right part to up grade my desk top memory. Can't really rate it sorry
1,Image in listing is misleading,Yes I wanted a single 2gig piece and was confused and got two 1s. This is certainly not that clear unless you read every word of this listing.The main picture should start with the two item image not the single.This is going back.
5,"Easy install, twice as fast","Got this for my Dell Inspiron 1501. Install was super easy, no issues at all w/ start-up, and now my computer is twice as fast. Very pleased."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH GATEWAY T1616,"This doesn't work correctly with a Gateway T1616. One stick will work on the first RAM Slot, but it will not work in the second RAM slot. However, the ram does work. I tried it on an HP laptop that works succesfull. And, the motherboard of the T1616 works with samsung 1 gig in each slot. But doesn't work when you place crucial's 1 gig in the second slot."
5,Great Product at a Great Price,"What can I say? The memory works as memory should, it was delivered in a timely manner and the price was right. I'm very pleased with it."
5,A five-minute pep-up for your computer,This is a great value to give your laptop a little extra oompf. I was able to double my RAM in less than 5 minutes. I've noticed a considerable difference.
4,Crucial 2GB RAM set,"I installed the modules and at first they didn't work, then by using a lot more force to ensure they were seated correctly, all is well and they work great. I noticed an improvement in speed and performance immediately. I'm very happy with this."
4,Review Crucial 2GB PC2 5300 667Mhz Sodimm DDR2 Ram,I received this item 2 days after I ordered it. I plugged it into my laptop and began using it immediately (took about 10 minutes). It functions just as I expected. I doubled the size of my ram (up to the max my computer can handle) and noticed an increase in my computer speed. What I was interested in was to decrease the wait time for when I open the internet browser until the home page appears. I can't put a number on the time saved but the computer now acts smoother and performs cheerfully instead of begrudgingly opening a web page.
5,Great for the Aspire One,I purchased this kit of two 1GB sticks so that I could upgrade two Acer Aspire One netbooks. They work great. Crucial makes nice memory. I've never had issues with their products.
5,Great for a low RAM laptop upgrade,"I upgraded my old Compaq Presario with this 2GB kit and it was perfect - no problems with it at all.NOTE: As with all RAM, make sure it's the correct type before purchasing or it will not work with your motherboard. A little research goes a long way. Usually a manufacturers website will contain the motherboard specs and list which memory types are compatible with your board"
3,worked,"I doubled up the ram on my old Dell Inspirion e1505 from 1 to 2 gigabytes of ram. My processor is a 1st gen Intel Core Duo 1.6mhz. The computer recognized the upgrade without a hitch. I do a lot of high-end work in Photoshop, but honestly only see a little bit of a difference in stability while running more than one app. But I'm fine with it all, I still use my computer every day..."
5,Great US company ...,I talked with Crucial customer support before purchasing this product and got assurances that the memory would work in my computer.Will buy Crucial again.Jim Winkler
1,Crucial Shipped the Wrong product ... and then messed me around,"I ordered this through Amazon, which passed the correct order onto Crucial. Crucial shipped me DIMM instead of SODIMM. After phoning them and being left on hold for 40 minutes, they:1) refused to acknowledge they had made a mistake (despite the shipping order enclosed with ram providing all the correct order details)2) insisted that I ship the ram back AT MY EXPENSE3) would not ship me the correct ram at the price advertized on Amazon -- they wanted to charge $12 moreAltogether a foul experience. Avoid Crucial!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Does what it's supposed to, but a few problems","I previously had 2 512 MB sticks in my laptop and upgraded to these 2 1 GB sticks. The shipping was super fast. I used the super saver free shipping and got the memory in the mail 2 or 3 days later. My computer operates a little faster, obviously, but I have also gotten the bsod 3 or 4 times in the 3 weeks that I've had the upgrade now and I had never gotten the bsod before upgrading my ram. I've checked to make sure the sticks are installed properly and they are so I am still trying to figure out what is causing the problem."
4,Worth the money,"Adding this 2GB of ram to my laptop with which only came equipped with 1GB was well worth the money. This was the second laptop I upgraded to 2GB from 1GB and loved the performance increase on the laptop running XP Pro,(now running Windows 7) and thought it was a decent upgrade to the laptop running Vista. Boot up time was about the one operation I could really tell a difference in when it came to the laptop running Vista.Overall, I would recommend this upgrade to everyone who has 30 to 40 dollars to spend and wants to give their computer a visible boost.As a side note, if you have the time, I would also recommend creating a pagingFile partition."
5,Works Great!,After installing the additional RAM in my laptop I expected nothing less than a faster PC. I was not disappointed.
2,depressing,"I am an avid romance reader, but this story left me depressed, I like reading a book and when I am done I feel happy, glad, but not sad. This story line was good but NOTHING in this story was upbeat. I normally pass my books on to friends, but this one is going in the trash."
2,Crois Refills -,"I have used only one of the Cross refills and it was dry, scratchy and did not write easily. Unsatisfactory."
1,Yuck,"Although this garlic press looks nice and has a handy cleaning tool attached, it doesn't work at all. It doesn't have a flat surface for pressing the garlic and therefore the garlic doesn't come through. I was very disappointed with this product and would not recommend buying it!"
5,Autograph Football,This football was perfect for what I needed it to be. I had it autographed and it looked great. Quality was perfect in every way.
3,"Not really GRE style, but better than nothing","I can only summarize what other customers have already said about this book. The test problems are really different from those that ETS itself hands out and those of the (unfortunately single) test exam in ""Cracking the GRE Math Subject Test"". Worse is that often the knowledge that is asked is not required for the real test, more intricate and neither covered in the ""review"" nor in the explanation of the correct answer.However it is the only book, that provides a sufficient number of full-length practice exams with a look-and-feel which is similar to that of a GRE subject test, therefore I still give it a 3 out of 5."
1,Bad product from the start,"I wish I read the bad review before I bought this. I may return it, but it took me more than an hour to peel the sticker and cut myself in the process. I have never seen something stuck like that before. I got four items from Amazon this time, and the fact that they keep such an item in stock make me wonder. I haven't had enough experience with it but look like someone else had. And it is not good. Also it is a very simple utensil and sells for a good amount so you expect a good one. All what it takes is one bad experience for me and I don't buy again from the same site."
4,A book for passionate gardeners,"At last, a cottage gardening book for Americans! (Although many of the luscious photos appear to be English.) The most valuable chapter is early on, The Ruling Passion exercise. Please take time out from reading to answer the questions and think about what you really want and need from your garden. You might be surprised by what you discover. I attended a wonderful lecture Rand gave on this topic, which generated more enthusiasm than any talk I can remember. A couple of participants were shocked to discover that what they thought they wanted was, in fact, what their friends or neighbors expected, and not what truly gave them pleasure and satisfaction. The realization was shocking, but also exhilarating and energizing, renewing enthusiasm for the hard work of gardening. This is gardening from the heart and for the soul. It also makes for entertaining reading on a snowy day."
3,This is a book!,"-From Groucho Marx:From the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down, I was convulsed with laughter. Someday I intend reading it!"
5,ARE YOU SERIOUS?,"How can there not be any previous reviews of this classic work? KHAN,WILL LEE,STEVE GADD,BRECKER BROS.DON GROLNICK,DAVID SANBORN !After reading all the praise (well deserved)for all of Steve's current and past work I just couldn't believe no one ever reviewed THE BLUE MAN!You have to hear it to believe it. EYE OVER AUTUMN (for folon) alone is worth the price, if you don't like the CD I'll give you double your money back"
3,Good but wordy.,"A very useful contribution to our understanding of ourselves and our sexuality. But needed editing: could be 1/3 shorter. Read it, and be surprised."
1,haven't received yet!,"It's been 6 weeks since I ordered this product and I have still not received it yet.Because I live in Hawaii purchases take longer to make it here, but I wouldn't have order this item if I knew it was going to be shipped by slow boat from the East Coast."
2,Not for anyone with Mathematics or Computer Science background,"This book is unbelievably tedious and repetitious. There is very little actual content for the length of the book. It takes nearly 200 pages just to define some very basic terms from graph theory. This might have been fine if the space were taken up by some sort of meaningful discussion on the relevance of these graph theory concepts to sociological studies and theory. The book (possibly the field?) has the flavor of ""here's a hammer, now what can we hit with it?"".Would have liked to see a format based on justification of the analytic techniques from sociological principles, or something much much more concise. Nothing much to see here, move on."
1,terrible,"I was so looking forward to these thinking they were going to be like the roll ups I had when I was a kid. These are terrible. They taste like flour and pumpkin with gritty bits in it. Does not taste like apricot at all and is a bright orange in color. Nothing at all like a natural fruit roll up. Don't waste your money on these get the stretch island fruit leather instead. They taste so much better, like actual fruit."
4,Another Constantine classic,"`Freeze's Over' is a great addition to any tpb collection. In this volume, you get not only the four-part title story, but also two others.""...buried"" is a single shot story, illustrated by former Preacher and Hellblazer artist Steve Dillon.""Freeze's Over"" centers on the legend of the `iceman', a killer reputed to have existed for over a hundred years. Outside a small town bar, a man is found impaled on an icicle, and John Constantine fast becomes a suspect. But when a group of strangers arrive, the true killer may be harder to identify.""Lapdogs and Englishmen"", featuring guest artist Guy Davis (of Sandman Mystery Theatre), gives us a glimpse of John's old days as a punk rocker.Overall, this book may not stack up as a great when compared to some of the other Hellblazer trades, but this is still a very worthwhile book. The writing, all by Brian Azzarello, is snappy, and the multiple artists do nothing to distract from these stories."
4,Mono is the place to start (and maybe stop),"This box makes great listening on its own, but if you directly compare it to the Hitsville USA box of mono masters, the differences are quite dramatic. The stereo sound is softer, smoother and more colorful, but the mono tracks have a punch and intensity that the stereo tracks only occasionally match. I don't think anything has been botched here- the stereo mixes (where unaltered) are very similar to my LP box of stereo Motown hits- it's simply the best their equipment could do back then. Some of the remixes appear to have been done with a genuine effort to match the organic power of the mono tracks, and the results are fascinating. But I'd say the Hitsville USA has it where it matters- it swings harder, is more authentic, and costs less. Get over mono-phobia- Hitsville USA is the mandatory purchase."
1,Same DVD as Random Access Memory but different cover.,"This is the same exect DVD as Depeche Mode ""Random Access Memory"". Only thing that was different was the cover picture! I was very disappointed and wasted my money for the same thing I already had."
1,Terrible service,"Amazon has got to revamp its customer service practices. One orders something, Amazon sends you what they interpret you want, you complain, they say the mistake was yours, then they re-send an inferior count of the original merchandise ordered. What a terrible company. The year has not even had a good start and already Amazon and its resellers, have bothced up 96% of my orders. What the rest of the year has in store is frightening, just thinking about it. Fortunately, I will not be doing business with them anymore. Good luck to all of you that enjoy getting the Amazon shaft. It is pittiful; downright pitiful. A real crappy organization. Filled with incompetence; incompetents and more, pitiful just downright pitiful."
2,Audix Fireball-V Harmonica Mic-be very cautious,Ive been playing harp for a long time and ive used a lot of equipment. My primary amps have been a 59 Bassman reissue and a Sonny Jr.- Sonny II. If you're used to a mic with a crystal or ceramic element don't buy this mic! The gain on this thing is pretty poor. A good mic for acoustic style harp or singing/playing through the PA..Sonny Boy style...but not for you if you want a mic with gain or a crunchy sound. Im not in the habit of saying anything negative ever but if you're used to a JT-30 or Green Bullet with a vintage element this thing will disappoint you. On the plus side the size of this mic is cool and the volume control always wins points with me. Im kind of stuck with this thing so im going to try an EQ and maybe try a differnt amp or two. Just a heads up. If you think you'd like to buy this mic id strongly advise you find someone who has one and try it with your harmonica rig set up. Thanks and Happing Harping.
1,A World Of Pain...,"After replacing a failed PT-130 on my Tracker with the identical product i've had nothing but headaches. The replacement worked fine for about 2 months, but eventually shorted and melted my entire wire harness from the trim all the way to the inside of my motor. Based on my experiences with 2 of these products - both with faulty trim motors - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. Now not only do i need to replace the trim again, but im also in the market for a new motor. This is completely unacceptable."
4,Good Product,"Have athletic kids who go thru bottles like ""water"". After living at Dick's getting one per week or month after the straw would break, these are heaven sent. They take a beating, deal with the dishwasher well etc. Great for soccer and even better for lacrosse and hockey where a long straw is great so you dont have to remove your helmet. My kids drag them around by the straw all the time(not recommended and a killer to other bottles) and they cant break them.Go Mueller!"
2,"Looked good, but couldn't see all details. ""Wings"" of the pack, out toward strap, were not accessible. Gave it away.","Looked good, but couldn't see all details in photo. ""Wings"" of the pack, out toward strap, were not accessible (as they were in the pack I owned) so not enough room. Gave it away."
4,The perfect system for my small living room!,"I live in an apartment and am very cramped for space. The Ensemble 4 surround sound speakers are the ideal solution for me. They are small and unobtrusive, yet they sound really great! My friends can't believe that all that sound is coming from those little speakers. The woofer hides under an end table and the small speakers are mounted on the wall. I would highly recommend this system to anyone that is looking for big sound from small speakers...oh yeah, and the price absolutely can not be beat- I know, I shopped around!"
3,dated but good,"The orchestration on these songs is so very dated, some are painful to listen too. BUT Peabo's voice carries it thru, and makes it all worthwhile. Great singer."
5,You WILL like these,I am not a professional reviewer so this is my first but these speakers are SO awesome. You will love them. I hooked them up to my Mac and they are the loudest speakers I have ever had. They are accurate as well. You will like them.
2,Microbiology Reference,"This is a fair microbiology lab manual; however, there are several better, but it was cheap. FDA puts out a BAM manual which has more depth and ther are several others worth looking into."
1,For Bass Drum Lovers,"The Bose engineers added 20db of amplifier boost between 20hz and 100hz. This extremely bass-heavy sound is popular these days. And the speakers and Wave technology can reproduce these low frequencies very well. But I'd rather hear something besides the bass and the bass drum. It's not so bad if you get back about twenty feet because the lows are attenuated by the air and distance. But up close, like on a nightstand next to the bed, the heavy bass and low rumbling will drive you berserk. Turning the talk radio setting to ""on"" for FM listening helps quite a bit. But they didn't include this feature when the radio is set to AUX, which is what I use for CD's and XM radio. The boosted low frequencies make music from these sources unlistenable. You can run the CD or XM signal through a separate mixer or equalizer to cut some of the lows. It's just too bad that Bose didn't include tone controls on a radio this expensive so the sound could be adjusted with a couple of knobs."
4,Expressionist Opera,"I learned of this opera in music class. From the bits I saw in class and online, I had to see the whole opera. It is very good. I really liked how much of it was filmed outdoors and not on a stage. If you like opera, this is one to see."
4,May be enjoyed by Harry Potter fans,"Though it doesn't include the humor that the Potter books have, I see similarites between High House and the Potter books--young man learning magical powers. The plot moves quickly with plenty of action, though sometimes I wondered how Carter could be so naive as to fall for the traps of his evil opponents, e.g., the Child (Order Incarnate). Otherwise, I would have given this book a 5. I greatly appreciated finding an entertaining read sans vulgar language and sex. Kudos to the author for proving it can be done with style! I'm looking forward to the sequel."
3,Not quite The Office,"Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant have tried to turn the success of The Office into another showcase for the talents of Mr. Gervais with limited results. The painful discomfort of watching people behaving badly that was such a joy in The Office does not translate as well to Extras. With a very limited cast of regulars, it is up to Gervais to carry the whole load in this series and he is clearly better as the lead in an ensemble. His character in The Office was reprehensible and that was balanced by the rest of the characters in the show whereas his character in Extras has to be more sympathetic as he can't rely on much support. The comedy is toned down a great deal and does little more than cause a smile, rather than the laughs we became accustomed to in The Office. Not bad but not great."
1,Pardon?,Ricky Gervais is Mr. Unfunny in my opinion. If there was an option to choose zero stars I think that would be more apropriate.
5,Great OPEN-MINDED Recovery video!!,"Really enjoyed the documentary. Gives a very open-minded look of Alcoholics Anonymous. Great tool to have in the ""tool bag"" for Recovery work. If you are BIG into recovery or Spirituality, this a definite MUST-SEE!"
2,STEEL?,"Don't be fooled by the sturdy look of this product. Pieces fit loosly together and rust began appearing after about 12 weeks of use. If I had to do it all over again, I definately wouldn't stop looking here."
4,Good choice for rouch ups or alegies to dyes,"I've used this during the last days before using Henna or after a perm it covers gray very well. (I mix it with plush brown to get an auburn colour,"
2,Wrong answers/no errata,"I purchased this book based solely on the reviews posted here. I immediately noticed some typos and more importantly, a couple of wrong answers in the chapter quizes. The wrong answers are what has really scared me - in one instance, the explanation for the answer they give contradicts the answer given. I stopped studying from the book so that I could obtain the errata sheet - I certainly didn't want to learn incorrect information/techniques. To my surprise, I didn't find any errata sheets on their website, so I e-mailed customer service to obtain one. I was given a one-page errata for the Practice Test only - these were errors I hadn't noticed, but they stopped at the Practice Test - they didn't proceed into the chapters of the book. When I asked Customer Service for a more complete errata, they responded that they didn't have one.I find it difficult to study from a book in which I have no confidence."
5,Comprehensive study guide for the ASVAB,"You'll need this book if you want to go into a specific unit in the Armed Forces. Do well on the ASVAB, and you can get your choice."
4,A History of Walther,"This is a rather well thought out book...IF you're a collector on the vintage pistols.Although the photos could have been of a better brightness and contrast, they do serve to show a fairly comprehensive history of the Walther pistols. It would have been nice to see some movie and TV tie-ins to show how prevalent the Walther name has been on the large and small screens.What I would take exception with is the way the P99 was handled. An updated edition is warranted and would serve to remedy this oversight. The same can be said for the Walther line of airguns, be they pellet or BB pistols.Not a bad book, considering there is nothing else on the market that delves into the history and legacy of the Walther name in firearms."
5,Great speakers GREAT price,"The CSW model 6 speakers are large for book shelf speakers, The sound is great and they have a 8"" woofer, They completed my stereo system and made it sound great! Excellent warranty, No cost shipping when ordered direct from CSW, ordered by phone and talked to someone in Mass (which is nice in this day and age).For the money you can't go wrong!! Break them in , position them carefully and enjoy!! There is a 45 day satisfaction guarantee also,,, But I doubt you'll use it! Carl H"
1,"Ordered 1PC 1GB RAM, what arrived are 2pcs of 512MB",The title justs says it all. I'm just disappointed with the way my order was fulfilled.
5,Fabulous album!,"This CD is incredible...Hertzel has a way of getting into your soul with his lyrics and the amazing music and rhythms. Lay back, close you eyes, and listen. You will love it."
4,"Only way to get ""Silhouettes"" by the Rays anywhere!","The Rays original version of ""Silhouettes"" (A bona-fide must-own doo-wop classic) can't be found anywhere else. (I tried!) Even the boys at Rhino can't seem to license the master. Too bad, because the sound on this CD is definitely original, meaning most of these tracks just beg to be remastered. As for the rest of the tracks, seven of them are songs you probably already own a better-sounding copy of. Harder-to-find stuff includes ""Harper Valley PTA"", ""Teenage Prayer"", ""The Big Hurt"", and ""Teen Beat"". I give it a green light for collectors, but if ""Silhouettes"" is ever released from legal captivity in a better form, this disc is obselete."
1,Boxset never gets completed!!,"Do not buy this product. They stopped releasing these DVDs after Volume 9. So this Vegeta Saga 2 boxset will have one DVD included, and you can buy one more DVD and that's it. There will be about 3 more DVDs that will never be released to complete this set. So people who bought this starter boxset (like me) anticipating more to come got screwed."
3,Magic Eye good. Another Dimension great.,"The ""Magic Eye"" 3D books have been consistent, entertaining and numerous but if you really want to see great 3D check out the 3D of Bohdan Petyhyrcz. In the ""Another Dimension"" line of 3D books, Bohdan takes the art form into a whole new range. Complete with facial features and tremendous detail.This paticular 3D book was created with 88 images to complete with ""Another Dimension"" which has 87 images but the quality as usual cannot compete by a long shot."
4,"Great Music, Crummy Packaging","As the owner of several discs in the Oldies But Goodies series for quite a number of years, I recently ordered an additional six discs to ""fill in the holes"" in my collection. Much to my dismay, all arrived packaged in flimsy, cardboard ""albums"", rather than the substantial jewel cases used for my earlier purchases. In addition, some of the color combinations used on the packages (gold on red/gold on purple) make it nearly impossible to read the artists names without holding the package under a lamp.Try as I might, I was unable to find any information in the product details that mentioned the type of packaging. I intend to handle and play these discs for years, not just rip the songs to mp3's and load them on a hand-held player.In the interest of full-disclosure, and to improve customer satisfaction, I believe Amazon should include product packaging information."
1,8+8 now = 13 1/2,have 16' wood pile ordered 2 6'x8' tarps almost 3' short went to local retailer bought 2 more tarps fit perfect new tarps were thicker stronger came with bungee tie downs and WERE 1/2 PRICE cheaper then return shipping would not recommend unless you believe 11ozs = a pound of coffee
1,Don''t Bother,"This book doesn't speak to the subject of the Papillon breed with any expertise. A cheap attempt to get your money. You can learn more through searching the internet. Find a copy of The Complete Papillon, a much more relevent book."
3,Contents,"Good book for general information about dogs and for Papillon pictures, but is not really good if you are looking for information specific to the Papillon breed. The first half discusses the Papillon history, breed standard, & grooming. The rest of the book covers general information about buying a dog, finding a vet, training, dog laws & more."
5,Good through the years,I have been using about 12 of these for lobster parties over the years when ever I get back to the states and can find Maine Lobster. They are wonderful and still look good with no mechanical failure.
4,Served its purpose,"Yikes.... three days before Christmas noticed that I had the wrong size tablecloth so ran out to the major dept. stores. Much to my chagrin, few stores stock a tablecloth this long. Was pleased to find it on Amazon and, as usual, shipping was most prompt. The ""ivory"" was a little more yellow than I would have liked and, in retrospect, may have considered the white, but it looked nice on the dining room table."
5,Prophecies Denied,"First, to be honest, the bassist, is the son of my brother...and i have never been to one of his performances, since he plays in Sinister,shame on me...and not being a real hardcore Metal fan, of this genre, i hereby give you an objective review,First, sound is excelent,video also, (watched this dvd also on my pc) shots and editing are also very well done,if you're a Metal fan of this genre, you'll play this one over and over again..."
1,JUNK!,"I bought this DVD player about a year ago and have found I'm having the same problems as everyone else here: I tried playing a new DVD disc today and it wouldn't recognise the disc (the screen kept saying ""Disc Loading""). So, I tried another DVD disc and it played ok. Then I tried a regular store-bought music CD and the player froze-up! I couldn't eject the CD unless I turned off the player, turned it back on and then hit eject before it tried to load the disc again. Now, I can't get any music CDs to play (they all lock-up) and only one DVD in my whole collection will play! I got it for a fairly decent price at the time (including a rebate), but now it's a worthless piece of junk. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!!!"
1,Dead dpv855,Dead after exactly 1 year and 1 week. I have a TIVO and 2 vcr's so I barely used it at the most 10 times. A piece of electronics should not die before the cheap batteries that come with it
5,Green Lantern ION TPB,"An excellent read and one hard to find book , if you're a Green Lantern fan this is a must read."
5,Hilarious,I got this as a gift for my husband who is a big Martin fan! He loves it! When he wants to unwind he pops in this dvd and cracks up all night!

4,My favorite season!,I enjoyed every episode from this season. The only thing that I don't like about this DVD in particular is the fact that I have to manually press play for every episode unlike the other seasons.
4,Magical Moment in Television History,I've always enjoyed this production a great deal.Miss Warren is very charming and vulnerable in the lead.Damon sings well.The wicked mother and sisters are very funny.The score is lovely.And the moment in which Cinderella descends the stairs in silence is one of the most beautiful and moving moments in the history of television.
4,rodgers & hammerstein's cinderella,"The film was excellent. The actors did a superb job, and of course the music the best.Thanks,Cym Fogg"
5,Childhood memories,"This is the version that I can remember watching on CBS when I was a child and I have always loved it. Celeste Holm is a stitch as the fairy godmother. Walter Pidgeon and Ginger Rodgers were the perfect choices for the king amd queen. The entire cast was put together well. I had orginally taped it off the Disney Channel on New Year's Eve one year, but the soundtrack wasn't a good quality. Watching this is like visiting my childhood all over again. I also enjoy watching the 1997 version with Brandy."
3,"Excellent content, poor transfer.","My wife had this on VHS when we met, and it has always been one of her favorite movies. When I found it available on DVD, I new I had to buy it for her so we could enjoy the DVD quality sound and image in our home theater. I was very disapointed with the image quality, it looks as though it was transfered from an old VHS to DVD rather than from original master tapes. The songs, story and acting, are still as wonderful as they were on the VHS, I was just not happy with the image and sound quality of this DVD."
2,"Avoid this dated, inferior production","I remember watching this as a kid, and it was one of my favorites. I recently saw it again after about 20 years, and must say I was extremely disappointed. Yes, it had an all-star cast, and Leslie Warren's performance holds up quite well. But compared to the 1997 production (with Brandy and Whitney Houston, etc.,) this version is SO stiff, so wooden, so BORING, and the guest stars all stodgy and way too old for their parts. (Pat Carroll as a step-sister? She must've been at least in her late 40's when this was filmed.) But most importantly, the sets are so unbelievably cheap and tacky, the special effects are so shoddy -- it's really embarrassing to watch stars like Ginger Rogers stooping so low to appear in such a ""stagey"" low-budget production. (Buy the newer (1997) version -- it was directed by Rob Marshall, the same man who directed the Oscar-winning ""Chicago"", and compares almost to the Wizard of Oz when it come to the production quality.)"
1,Impossible!,...for a movie to be this bad!(even for an old movie that was fimed for t.v) The sets were horrible and very fake looking. I could have forgot about the sets if the actor and singing was good or even ok. But the acting was just as bad if not worse! It was very stiff and reminded me of people reading off a telepromter! The stepmother and stepsister were ok and provided brief comic relief. But Leslie Ann Warren was awful! Her acting was very chessy and fake and her singing... She sounded like a contestent on American Idol! (a bad one)She was so out of tune and had horrible diction. The prince's voice was nice though.Well all i have left to say is please don't waste your time watching this movie and go straight to the newer version starring Brandy and Whitney Housten.
3,psychological approach to dog obedience,"Very philosophical and psychological in his approach to dog training. Some good comments and suggestions on positive rewards and training. Believes a dog should never hear ""no"". If a dog is on a couch and you want to teach him not to get on the couch, you first reward the dog for being on the couch and then offer larger rewards for not getting on the couch. If your dog barks, either ignore it or try to distract him. Lots of personal rememberances and stories. Strong believer in holistic medications and home prepared organic dog food. Not indexed. If you want only one training book, this would not my choice"
2,Way to much for the dog and not enough for the trainer,"I let my dog jump around on the bed at night, and he is welcome anywhere in the home. I love my dog, and give him lots of positive attention. However, these techniques are based on the owner not needing a job, so that every second can be given to the dog and the training that needs to be done at all times. Hand making food, and making sure I have new age music for my dog? I don't like much new age music. I think my dog can get by with what I listen to. The idea of playing the music when you go away is to give the dog the appearance of attention so they won't get bored and become mischevious. I however, don't think pandering to every little thing is good. We shouldn't need to play the dog music for the rest of its life when we leave the home. I love my dog, but I think that the dog should work around my schedule a little more than this book implies."
2,This is nothing like Ceaser's book!,"This book, while informative, is nothing like the concepts in Cesear Millan's book, Ceaser's Way, so if you are thinking about getting this one to supplement that other book's purchase THINK AGAIN."
4,A different view of things,"Still reading this book as I write this review, but as far as I am concerned it was well worth the money I spent on it. I have a miniature Beagle who had me at my wits end until I started using the techniques inside. Compassion has worked so much better at reinforcing his good behaviour than throwing my hands up in frustration or yelling ever did!"
5,No other way to train,"As far as I am concerned, there is no other way to raise and train a dog. Hopefully you don't own a shock, choke, pinch or prong collar, but if you do, throw it away and order this book! This gentle, effective training method concerns the whole dog, not just a behaviour issue! I've trained all my dogs this way and I own two obedience (yes obd trials without aversive training!)and agility champions!"
2,Nothing new,"I have been a trainer for many years, and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist - and I can tell you that Paul Owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training. This book is an average (at best) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other (professional) dog trainers/behaviorists. I've read many, many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing. If you're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do - check out any of Stanley Coren's books (he has many). If you're looking for training techniques - take a class. Honestly, there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes (with a respectable and knowledgable trainer) where they can be properly socialized and trained. If your dog is having serious behavior issues - consult a professional animal behaviorist. Your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody. Good luck!"
2,Does not fit the 20GB Color Ipod,"This is the second time I have bought an accessory online for my Color 20GB Ipod only to discover that it is designed for the monochrome 20GB Ipod only, apparently. Very frustrating. No instructions and nothing on the packaging or item description explaining this. Anyway, if you are looking for a case or a belt clip for a color 20GB Ipod, do not buy this case, it simply is not quite thick enough."
5,"Comfy, comfy, comfy","Comfy. Not for joggin around the block but great for a night out or hanging out. I have 3 pairs now and love them. About as close to wearing nothing as I care to get. Only improvement I would make would be for better elastic around the waist. I'll get my wife to replace it with better, softer elastic when it finally gives out."
2,Apple peeler,This item broke on our second use. Either we used it wrong or it just plain broke. But with results like that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
3,"Good Tool, weak blade","The tool is reasonably good. The flaw is that the corer/slicer blade at the end is very weak. It is too thin and bends with any item that offers some resistance. It is okay with apples though you have to keep aligning the blade when it bends. With the only potato I tried it really shows its weakness.The frame, clamp, and turn screw are good. It is easy to clean if you do it before it dries.Except for the blade, it is easy to maintain and works well. I would recommend it. I would like to see if I can get the end-blade replaced."
1,Never got it,"We ordered 2 peelers, one for us and one for a friend. We only received 1 and gave it to the friend. We still haven't received the other one so I can't review it but my friend loves it."
1,Don't go there,This is the second time I purchased this type of peeler. The handle broke on the first apple. I had it repaired and the peeler blade bent constantly.
5,apple peeler and corer,"I love, love, love this item. It is very easy to use and makes peeling and coring an apple a breeze. I findmyself eating more apples because of the ease of using the peeler / corer. Highly recommend it."
3,Bulova watch,"It is a very pretty watch, but the hole on the face that shows the date is too small to show the date properly."
4,Fine Basic Bulova Watch,"This is a fine basic no frills example of Bulova watches. After all, you just want the time and date - really - that's all. I chose this as a Christmas present for a friend who is a Nurse. She has remarked that she has sought an easy-to-read dial, with date feature: as she works night shifts, the easy-read in low lighting is a necessity. This Bulova fills the needs as stated. It will be a nice Christmas for her, and I'll tell her I found it on Amazon where all the best buys are available."
4,Hatteras Hammocks C-CM40 Double Cushioned Linen Swing,"I purchased this swing in early June so that I'd have some nice outdoor seating for family visitors I was expecting at the end of the month. The swing arrived in a timely manner, but when I got the parts out and started to put is together, I discovered that the top bar was the wrong part. That's when the trouble started. I had trouble contacting Hatteras Hammocks Customer Service, (it took them a couple of day to respond by e-mail, and their 800 phone number was not functioning properly), but once I did get a service rep, a replacement part was sent out (it took about a week to arrive). Unfortunately, my visitors had come and gone by that point. However, with the correct part, assembly was fairly easy and fast, and the swing is *very* comfortable as well as attractive. So overall, I would recommend this swing (hopefully the parts error was an isolated incident)."
4,Comfy but not so big,"This porch swing is pretty darn comfortable. It's also attractive. The only problem is the following: it's not really a two person swing. On the other hand, it's not really a one person swing. Instead, it's somewhere in between. Two people can fit on the swing, but would fill it up. One person has lots of room, but can't really lie down for a nap (although a nap sitting up is a definite possibility and, given how comfortable it is, is certainly a viable option.) I don't want to suggest that two people cannot fit on the swing, but don't expect to have lots of room to spread out when two people want to sit on it. That having been said, it's much more comfortable than most wooden swings and is pretty easy to put together."
3,Less Was Not Enough,"I cancelled this order, once I realized that ""Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970-1978"" existed. The same songs on this cd can be found on ""SOTU"", plus 13 more tracks. If you can't take too much ""gloom & doom"", then this would be the perfect Black Sabbath collection for you."
2,love ozzy and sabbath...,"but c'mon why did they edit iron man? did they run out of space (only reasonable answer) but why iron man. why not war pigs, (love that song buthas a VERY long instramental part)and that why i rate 2 stars. could have had5 stars but sabbath, you f%$#ed up REAL bad. :("
2,'BEST OF' is misleading,"The edit/fade of version of IRON MAN makes no sense to me at all. It's one of their best and most beloved and well known songs and should have been included in its full length version, even if it meant leaving off one of their later, lesser songs. Do yourself a favor and skip this disc and try to buy the remastered versions of PARANOID and MASTER OF REALITY from the Amazon UK site. I would recommend you stay away from any Black Sabbath (or Ozzy disc solo for that matter) that list Sharon Osburne anywhere in the credits. She has done nothing but try to rewrite the history the this great band....what a shame!"
5,Black Sabbath Greatest,"Totally awesome but truly incomplete because it's missing great songs from the sabbath bloody sabbath album to fully complete their Geatest,"
4,"As Usual, Very Good (mostly)","The Oldies But Goodies collection on Original Sound are generally good buys, and this one is no exception. Many of the selections are unarguable classics - Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"", ""Come Go With Me"" by the Del(l?) Vikings, Frankie Ford's ""Sea Cruise"". Other items are perhaps not classics in everyone's mind, but still great - Bettie Everett's ""Shoop Shoop Song"", Preston Epps' ""Bongo Rock"" and especially ""Don't You Just Know It"" by Huey ""Piano"" Smith. But, as is usual for this series, there are a few what-th'-heck-is-THIS-doin'-here selections, and as usual, most of them are from the 70's. There are three 70's tracks here, and noting that Tony Orlando & Dawn's ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon"" is the best of the three says volumes. Well, your CD player has a track skip button for a reason. In general, a great collection."
4,it saved me,I was thinking of throwing away my old blender and buying a new one as the original square drive was became unusable after used for a long time but suddenly I came accross this. I replaced the old square drive pin and plate with this nw one and my blender is working like a new one.
2,ISN'T WORTH THE TIME,"I heard this recording because I read positive reviews about this cd on the internet. I am not quite sure how this could possibly have received those kind words. I found this album to be insultingly horrible. If there were ever a professional album that showed how unmusical an ""artist"" can be, this is truely it. One web-site compared her to Rampal and Galway, but it is quite evident that she is nowhere near that level. That same performance can be heard at a mid-level college recital. I am in no way trying to take shots at Mrs. Hanson, especially because I myself am a flutist, but I find it awkward that when I invited some friends over to listen to music, they thought it was a ""cute high school performance"". If you want to listen to ""artist"" check out Thomas Robertello,Galway, Emmanuel Pahud, Carol Wincenc, and Bonita Boyd. Yes, she got every note in the music, but so what, certainly there has to be more to success than that."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought the Simac MX700 PastaMatic Pasta Maker to replace my Cuisinart pasta maker. My Cuisinart was a bull at making pasta. It made 1-1/2 pounds at a time and was never a problem. I do not feel the same way about the Simac. Mine would overheat during extruding. Also, it barely made enough pasta to feed my family of 4. It finally died after 1-1/2 years of use. When I say died I mean it started smoking and making very strange noises. Also, there is no way I was going to send it back to Italy for service. I have resigned myself to purchasing homemade pasta at the store. I wish I could find a better pasta machine. What I really wish is that Cuisinart still made a pasta machine."
2,Great Handheld - Lack of Options,"I purchased this iPAQ for its price and size. Unfortunately, I didn't research the peripheral options. There are no keyboards designed for this iPAQ (the IR port is on the side), there are no mobile bluetooth keyboards on the market, there are no modems that fit the SD slot, there are no wired NIC that fit the SD slot, there is now a wireless network card which retails for $130, etc. I wanted something small that I could take notes in class and get and respond to email on the road. With no modem and no keyboard, this isn't been possible."
2,NO KEYBOARD AVAILABLE,"Great machine overall, but there are NO keyboards out there that work on this machine, therefore it's rather useless for writing or editing Word or Excel documents."
4,Makes it easier,"If you purchase the stand this will make repairs and maintenance easier. Personally, I believe it should be included in the price with the stand but, I'd like a happy healthy world too."
5,Easy and Simple,"Easy to use, and it stops that minor annoyance of the wheel/handlebars turning when you have your bike on a stand."
4,Does the job.,"This does the job, but I wonder if something like this could be better designed. The velcro strap actually pulls the front hooks up off the handle bar under some circumstances. You have to get creative with how it's clamped to the bike when you have a lot of attachments (bell, etc.) on your handle bars. It's just nice not to have the front wheel not flopping around when it's up on the rack."
4,It works but is expensive.,This is good when you need it and have not made something to do the same thing; it must work differently with each bike so I give it a 4 due to limitations and price but Park Tools does make quality it is the different configurations that will make this a useful tool for your habit!Hooty
4,"Another necessary, yet overpriced tool from Park","These types of handlebar holders are essential when working on anything related to the front of the bike. But just like the tool stand, the price is a little high for what you get. Now some may ask me, ""Why would you complain about something that costs less that $20?"" Well my only complaint is that it ought to be either included with the stand, or cost more like $10. Rubber coated mild steel is CHEAP.In the end, though, I would buy it again. Just might complain a little bit too!!"
5,"Big Bruno's review on ""Ashley Marie""","Greetings...I have been listening to country music since 1989 where I saw my first country concert...""The Judds"". I was hooked. Subsequently I've seen and heard just about all the new acts. The other day someone gave me a CD named ""Ashley Marie"". I knew of Ms. Marie as she has quite a following in the MD/WV/VA area but have never heard her perform. I was blown away. This young female artists has a great career ahead of her. Her voice reminds me of Reba's strong voice and country sound. Big Bruno highly recommends this CD."
2,"Diamonds fine, jeweler not so good","The stories included herein are gems, but the weak writing of the compiler Jon Holway doesn't provide the fine setting to display them. The audio version is a big improvement."
3,Listless mediocrity,"It's important to see a mediocre movie from time to time, a story told by an incompetent who barely knows what he's doing, so you can appreciate how many ambiguities creep into performances, cuts, plot meanders, when the director and producer are hacks. From the first, shaky shot to the rather ambiguous chemistry between the two leads, this is one missed opportunity after another, so one watches with an increasingly jaundiced eye as the story follows an utterly predictable path. Slick packaging and reviews far too generous led me to this piece of trash. I made up for it by watching the splendid ""Night train to Munich"" immediately afterward."
2,Yuck!,"This book is a muddled mess compared to the other books of it's series. I loved them! But this book is very confusing, not to mention pointless. Daystar leaves his house and blunders about the enchanted forest like a fool without knowing what he's doing. He is involved in a few confusing incidents, and you have no clue wether the outcome is good or bad. Besides, it is missing my favorite characters. I would have liked to see more of Cimorene, Telemain, and Morwen's cats. Sure Daystar and Shiara are cool, but they're no replacement."
3,"""Window Licker"" single is lost without the video","Never thought I'd say this about ANY Aphex Twin song... but ""Window Licker"" needs the visual to be truly appreciated... a vicious swipe at every current poular music video cliche. By itself the song seems incidental... Not a bad song, but again, you're better off spending the extra couple of bucks and buying the video."
4,GRAVE ONE OF THE BEST OF SWEDISH SCENE NOW IN DVD.....,FINALLY THIS DEATH METAL BAND PUT OUT THEIR DVD VERY NICE SHOTS OF THE GIG WITH AWSOME 5.1 SURROUND SOUND GRAVE ITS ONE OF THE OLDEST DEATH METAL BANDS OF THE SWEDISH SCENE GET IT I RECOMMENDED.-
1,Couldn't get this to work,I used to have a microwave rice cooker that worked great. This one was terrible and I never got the measurements right. Also was a bit on the bulky side. Kept the measuring spoons and got rid of the rest.
1,Save your money!,Product doesn't work very well. Save your money for something else that works. It's definitely not worth the time or money. Pasta cooks faster and tastes a million times better cooking it in a normal pot?
3,Make good rice but doesn't fit in the microwave,"Makes good rice but I think you need a massive microwave for this to fit properly. We have to take out the glass plate that turns underneath. Rice still turns out ok but doesn't turn in microwave, also it boils over almost every time resulting in necessary cleanup after each use. Other than that, great product that makes delicious rice!"
5,Great Product!,"I read a review and new it would be perfect! My boyfriend loves Artichokes and he had spent a lot of money on his last microwave steamer..so when I gave him this,he was so happy he bought one for his Parents! Thank you."
1,worst ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purshased this product to replace a microwave rice cooker by the same company but a smaller version. The smaller one worked extremely well and since i was sure of their reliability i decided to buy the bigger version. I was disappointed - it is made of cheap plastic and the design is flawed . The cooking water overflows and everytime i cook rice i have to clean out the turntable- at least half a cup of water overflows. Good for steaming veggies but not for rice or pasta.
4,Cheap and easy,"Very good set of basic tools for the kitchen. I have used this to cook rice with excellent results. I haven't used it to cook pasta, but I am confident that it would be easy. The set includes everything you need to make several easy dishes in the microwave. It is also dishwasher safe!"
4,Should have appeared on a few short lists,"Epic & astounding; this is a rigourous account of the last of the Wild West. ""The Last Crossing"" is beautifully crafted, well-written, and gripping. It is a fictional account based on actual facts (& fantasies) of the Canadian frontier. Jerry Potts, real-life scoundrel guide, becomes entangled in the complicated lives of some dandy British brothers with various grandios schemes... yet, Potts is the character that really shines & the reader finds most compelling. Despite his true-to-life downfalls, Potts was a character of great proportion & he carries this fantastic story through to its nobel end. Should have seen this book on some short lists last year (definately should have been on the Giller list); can't figure out why it wasn't. A worth-while read."
3,An interesting Mix,"Historical fiction with a modern eye overseeing all. Learned about some new people, but the pacing left a lot to be desired."
3,Sluggish,"This book was packed with historical detail, but I found the narrative sluggish. At times, I felt many of the passages should have been left to the ""backstory"" (i.e., edited out).But, the last battle scene, between the Crow and the Blackfoot Indian tribes, was absolutely riveting.And, though I felt the ending was veering toward high melodrama (on the ""two ships that pass in the night"" variety), I did appreciate knowing that at least one of the brothers was able to extract some meaning from his life . . ."
5,Worth the price,"This machine is well designed and well made. Not only that it does what it is supposed to do - make ice cream. I initially purchased the Cuisinart ICE 50 for less than half the cost and that is what I got less than half the Lello machine. The Cuisinart is badly designed, poorly constructed and limited customer service. An ice cream maker is essentially a refrigerator with a paddle to mix and maintain an even consistency. The refrigeration unit is well ventilated and so you have ice cream in as little as 30 min. Even after repairing my brand new Cuisinart, the ventilation was poor and the mixture came out like soup after 40 minutes. The mixer on the Cuisinart machine is on a long arm that has a tendency to be displaced upwards in the event the mix does become thick. Save yourself the brain damage and spend the extra money on this machine. The stress you save yourself will be worth it."
5,I'm thinking about buying another one,"Call me crazy but I love this gizzmo. I use it so much I'm afraid it's going to croak and I'll have to wait a few days for the replacement. Everyone loves the strawberry sorbet. The recipe calls for simple syrup (1 C water, 1 C sugar). I use 1 C strawberry juice and 1 C superfine sugar, and skip the boiling. The custard recipe is absolutely divine.Beats icecream parlor hands down."
5,Plum Pulping Nightmare,This item solved my plum pulping nightmare. Anyone that makes plum jam has probably tried the old colendar and potato masher trick. This item makes plum pulping easy.
5,I loved it!,"It may seem strange - but this was the perfect Baby Shower gift for a friend of mine. She's very into organic foods, and uses this constantly for baby food - especially some very incredible apple sauce."
5,Finally a Good Pencil Sharpener in the House,"I like to use plain old pencils. We never have a decent sharpener, so I bought this one. I've only used it a couple of times, but it works great. The parts are all metal and it seems to be very solidly built. Thank goodness X-acto is one of those brands that have kept quality high and stayed focused on what they are best at. Never been let down by an x-acto product."
2,pencils are not sharpened evenly,"Most of the time pencils are sharpened unevenly so that the wood on one side of the pencil extends all the way, or almost all the way, to the tip of the point. It seems like the hole and the sharpener blades are not aligned and the pencil sharpens off center."
2,"Same story, different sharpener","I purchased this item for my stepdaughter's new ""learning room"". My wife calls it a playroom, but we agreed that more learning and less playing should take place in it. Anyways, this sharpener looks great and it is exactly what I wanted in that department. Heck, from a functional standpoint it even feels great to use...right up until you slide your pencil out to discover the freshly sharpened tip is only HALF lead. Just as many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the alignment must be off resulting in a very frustrating writing utensil. I've pushed in different directions trying to get a good result with limited success. Even if I had success applying x amount of pressure in some direction y degrees, do I really expect our 6-year-old learner to replicate the process each time. For now I will continue to tinker with it in hopes of a better performing sharpener."
4,great pencil sharpener!,This is an old-school manual sharpener but it works BETTER than electric ones. I first used it in school and had to get one at home. it is inexpensive and i recommend it to anyone
4,Buy somewhere else,"It's a pencil sharper with few moving parts, so it works well. Good product. But the store that sells it charges an enormous shipping fee ($7.50) that is more than twice the cost of the product! What, was it shipped from the North Pole? Buy elsewhere and save yourself some dough."
2,Flawed,"I bought this book for my husband, a high school baseball coach, as a Christmas present. He has ALWAYS had a strong bunting game, so I though that maybe this book would give him some extra tips on how to maybe explain something in a different way or some drills he could run. He calls himself a student of the game, always looking for new things to add to his bag. Well, he was very excited when he got it, however he told me a few days later that after getting into it and reading it he wasn't so impressed. I don't understand a lot of his baseball talk, but from what I made out of it, he felt that the bunting technique that was being taught was old school and flawed."
3,Too many insights,"As a 6th grade teacher, I found this book to be a good reference tool for myself. However, my students were overwhelmed and did not know where to start with it. The text layout is scattered and busy. It does have some beautiful photographs and great illustrations with captions that provide an ample amount of good information. MacDonald's ""How Would You Survive..."" book is much more reader-friendly for those interested in the Aztecs."
4,Great Sound bad hardware,"This system is perfect for filling a large office with sound. It sounds as good as my home stereo system, but it can't be cranked quite as much.I have had these for 3 years now, and the speaker input clamps on the sub are made of plastic, and 2 of 4 have snapped off. Take care when connecting not to let those brittle suckers pop. Pain to fix, so now I just have it rigged to stay connected.They still sound great!!!"
5,High School Musical 2,Not quiet as good as the first movie and soundtrack but daughter loves it and mom doesn't mind listening to it.
3,"good music, but to computerized","The reason I loved the first soundtrack is because all the songs were actually the characters singing. this one there will only be one character singing but you hear background singers that aren't actually in the movie.I just finished watching it on TV and there is one song where Zac is singing by himself in the middle of a golf course, yet some how he has backup singers. The last soundtrack when Vanessa sang there was no one else, just her voice.every song in this movie has some sort of background music or studio mechanics that shouldn't be there. Like echoing. That is not original. In most of the songs, you can't hear a lot of the actual people singing.I was disapointed that they don't let the performer's voices shine through like in the first one."
4,Some filler - but Sharpay Tisdale's songs stand out,"Snagged this disc recently, by now I'm tired of the leadoff track so I skipped to Track 2 which is a Sharpay Tisdale bonanza. The song is called ""Fabulous"" and it is very catchy. However the best track of them all is the Bonus Track ""Humuhumunukunukuapua'a"" and that's definitely classic Sharpay Tisdale there. I know everyone will agree. Such a cute song.Nessa's songs are kinds weird - her vocals are strange in here. I like the closing number however ""All For One"" it's basically just like ""We're All In This Togehter"" but a little better."
2,Sadly not very good,I loved the first one and feel it was incredibly good but what was up with this one? I mean it was horrible and the soundtrack is awful. Buy the first one instead.
3,missing something,yea you provide alot of information but you are still missing something and i think it is the most important. Its not only about teaching your class but talking to them before after and during class please write a book that deals with the voice of an instructor
3,liked it a lot until snap broke,"I loved this bag. It has the roomy diaper bag attached so I no longer had to tote diaper bag too. It is cushy, much more than the cheaper ones look. But about the 15th time out with it, the snap that holds him in broke. I emailed company through their site but got no reply. I was using it without the strap and son almost scambled out so I stopped using it. I am going to sewing store to find replacement clip and hopefully can fix it. I would have given it 5 stars cause it was really nice until it broke and the company ignored my request for help. Can you say ""Buttheads"" on Amazon?"
2,Pleased or Not?,Unfortunately two of the movies were extremely poor quality. Even thought the two movies kept freezing every couple of minutes and then restarting it was very nice to see these flicks once again.
3,I think I'm just stubborn,"The tape is really good, I believe I am just hard to hypnotize. It came within two days! I was shocked to see it in the mail so soon after purchasing. I am going to use it several times so as to fight my determined overweight side!"
5,Great gift for my brothers birthday,"This was my brothers request and where else would I go, I knew Amazon would have the best price and I got free shipping too in the deal!"
5,Cozy and functional!,"The shopping cart cover is great! It is pretty easy to open with one hand, is large enough to fit over any cart, but will still work on small ones and high chairs. It covers every surface they could possibly touch, which is a MUST for me!The fabric is really plush and cozy, my baby often falls asleep in it. I'm not as impressed by the pillow as I thought I would be, it's a little too big to put behind or in front of my 19 pd 6month old but that's really not a problem, as it is detachable.There are all kinds of cool features on this cover, like toy loops, bottle holders, and a place to put not only diaper bag essentials but also your own keys and wallet!"
5,Well padded cart cover!,"Very nice cart cover. Well padded, right down to the attached pillow. Packs up easily when not in use. Nice fabric!!"
4,Great french fries,"I love being able to make my own french fries, but it would be nice if the blades were sharp on one side so I would not be sending french fries flying all over my counter when I cut them. Otherwise, I think it is great."
1,how i rated this .,"for one its to small to slice potatoes , cheaply put together,I would send it back if i did not lose the box it came in."
3,It works with a little strong arm.....,"This product does work and worth the buy but you have to hold it down on a potatoe which is fine because the potatoe is pretty thick but everything else like celery, or carrot sticks, no problem. Worth the buy!"
1,Do not waste your money.,Do not waste your money.It barely went through a piece of a regular potato. While cutting through a potato it was bending and felt like it would break. I ended up using a knife instead.
2,disappointing,Not easy to operateFlimsydisappointingThis product come from one of Amazon's partners.I cannot recommend this product
2,French fries,Does not make fries well. Takes too much power to use. I'll probably never use it again.
4,Practical and affordable,"I waited about a year to review this product because I wanted to see if it would last a year--it did. I want to point out that this is a home sized potato and vegetable cutter. It makes great french fries and is a helpful onion cutter. It is not difficult to clean.However, it is a smaller sized cutter. If you were looking for a french fry maker for a comerical kitchen, I recommend going bigger than this one.If you are cooking for a family of five, this is a good way to go."
3,Strong arm?,This unit works great if you have a strong arm. Trying to pass a medium sized potato through the smaller grater takes quite a bit of force. I thought it was going to break but eventually this little unit did it's job.
1,needs too much muscle,"My daughter and I were not able to use this cutter at all. You've got to have a lot of muscle to push anything through the blades, and we simply couldn't do it at all."
3,light weight,"this product can only cut very small potato's, about 3 inches, And even with a small potato's it was very hard to work. It might be able to cut other vegs. but not good for potato's"
3,not what i thought,"this one is ok but not as good as the one I purchased here a few years ago. I thought I was buying the same one, but no. My other one had suction cups on the bottom that worked really well and it was made better. This one is ok, it does the job. But not sure how long it will last before it breaks. I can't say I would recommend it."
1,Horrible customer service. Unreliable device!,"Pros: The product is great when it works. It has all the awesome functionsw that you can find in a little device like this. It is very user friendly and when you purchase a SD card, you can store music, pictures, and other files that you could use. Not only that, the GPS system works quite well (again, when it works...)Cons: The device failed within a 2 week period. I send it in for ""review"". Came back with a bill for over $300 and said that I dropped the device. Unbelieveable, I did not drop the device, the connector to recharge/sync stopped working. Well...dealing with their customer service was like hell. I would highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product unless you can are technically familiar with these devices. Otherwise don't expect much help from the customer service."
5,Finally for MAC,"This Pocket PC is wonderful. All of the features work well. Especially appreciated is the handwriting recognition - it simply works pretty well - the processor is strong enough so you do not have to struggle with recognition. It takes a bit of getting use to - but once done it is very handy - especially for someone who does not like a lot of paper - keep your thoughts, notes, etc electronic. The recognition software is an update to the Newton - which many Mac users loved but which Apple dropped but with a lot more processing power. If you buy this and are a Mac devotee - I would also recommend PocketMac Pro - which is a Mac front end - including a look and feel of OSX - now you do not have to sacrifice synchronization or OSX."
5,HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you have any sense of humor you'll love it. It was a really good play. I'm not sure why people are only giving the play one star. The play did have one flaw, the plot was everywhere and there wasn't any real main problem there were mini problems that were solved kind of quickly. If you're in love with stageplays and like to see the true beauty of stage performance then this may not be fit for you. But if you're not uptight and love to laugh I'd definately buy if I were you.The play is mainly targeted to the ladies and/or black community, but i gues comedy is a UNIVERSAL laqnguage, anyway I think oyu should get it to see if oyu like it because we all have different views on what's funny, so go out and get you a copy of Shelly Garret's Beauty Shop and see if oyu like it, like i did."
1,Piece of Junk,I can't believe how crappy this was. I never had a problem with quality from Amazon before but this was definitely the exception. I knew it was plastic when I ordered it. When it came it looked like it was discolored. It also had yellow glue in the seams. This was the first time I returned something because of quality. Doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it.
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"I loved this book! It is my favorite Erin McCarthy book. Even though I might not have hot sex when I first meet a hot guy, Erin McCarthy's characters and their emotions are so believeable, it is plausible when they do. This book made me laugh out loud several times, and is one I'll read again and again. I can't give a book a higher recommendation than that."
2,Worst Erin McCarthy book.,I've read a lot of Erin McCarthy's books and this one is by far the worst. The characters know each other for all of two seconds before they start going at it like animals. That is something that normally wouldn't bother me but neither one of them showed a single endearing quality that should make either one of them WANT to sleep with the other one. I got about a quarter of the way through the book before I had to stop reading it. All I heard was WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE WHINE! Shut up already! No one cares! The plot is weak and almost an afterthought- something that was only written in to keep the story going while the two main characters have sex. I'm definitely upset that I spent the money on this one despite the negative reviews I read.
1,Someone thought this was funny??,"The only way the people in this book could get any more stupid is if someone held a hose to their ears and blew.I couldn't even finish this book. I can't believe there are still books where women are this completely, absolutely brainless and I am insulted that it even exsists. I will certainly never read any book by this author again."
1,Another Puerile Read by Ms. McCarthy,"I was really hoping that SMART MOUTH would be better than MOUTH TO MOUTH (my first Erin McCarthy novel). Surprise, surprise...it didn't take me long to see that I would be disappointed--AGAIN! I didn't even get pass Chapter 2 without rolling my eyes at the heroine's silly antics. I found Reese even more obnoxious than Laurel (the female protagonist of MOUTH TO MOUTH). She's a snotty character: selfish, arrogant, annoying, and yes...bitchy. I wouldn't have had the patience that Derek (our hero) so amazingly bestowed upon her. Thus said, this is definitely going to be my last Erin McCarthy read."
4,"Rhodium Plated 925 Sterling Silver Band, Cubic Zirconia","Very nice ring, looks real, good quality too.I am very satisfied."
4,Nice price for a ring,"Shipping was very fast. Ring looks amazing except the center stone is loose in the setting and the prongs look a little wimpy. I still like this ring even though I know it's not the real thing. It makes me feel glamorous, and it shines almost as nicely as my real one. I bought this one for when my real set is getting fixed."
3,So-so,"I tried these because Johnny Chuoke (handyman, hardware store owner and journalist) talked highly of them. I bought one for my son's room which smells like a football locker room and one for the room with the kitty litter box. In both instances it lasted less than a month. I did noice improvement in my son's room, but it didn;t make a dent with the kitty litter room. I'm still looking for a better product."
4,"The ultimate camping system!,","I have the SoundWorks with their carry bag and battery pack and every year I take it and my portable CD player on our annual camping trip. It is a staple! Food, beer and SoundWorks is all we need for a good time in the great outdoors! It sounds like a home stereo system but is so easy to pack up and take along with us. We even lug it down to the beach with us so we can listen to our favorite CDs while we swim!"
1,Don't waste your money!,This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw it at the theater 20 years ago and I still consider it to be the biggest waste of my movie money. I know this doesn't help much without movie details. I just remember expecting mystery and suspense - all I got was gore with no real story.
5,Fantastic!,"Saw this years ago, found it again and enjoyed it. Caine was wondeful, this type of film is very entertaining."
5,Waterman,"If are looking for a perfect gift this is the solution, you don't need wrap it the box is elegant, the relation price / quality is great, I recommend it 100%"
3,kampen,"Wow this sounds frightening in parts. Long 20min plus arrangements with some pretty generic black metal sections, but its the indescribable ambient sections like the first part of ""water"" which are unique. I aint heard parts like this before, Arckanum is keen on portraying the forests and woods sort of thing in its music and it all adds to the chilling atmosphere.Watch out for those hooded axe wielding orcs in a forest near you....."
3,Of minor interest,"This is a movie about The Brasilia, Brazil Dance Seminar and Competition. It is of some interest to ballet afficianodos (who would lose little from skipping this) and of very little interest to someone who is not already deeply interested in ballet."
3,Good book but,"It smells kind of funny. Very plastic-y. Perhaps once we have had it out of the plastic wrapping for longer. My six month old is not super into it, maybe because it smells funny, hopefully he'll like it more in another month or two."
4,My book was about a murder mystery at an acting camp.,I like this book because it keep you on your toes it always surprised you and you never know what's going to happen next. This book is an challenging to read but that's what made it so good!
4,SAD,When I read it I thought it was fun but as we heard about the main charter boyfriend that died it was a really sad sorry. You might wat to read it or not but the main character had been through the horror of her dead bf for years
4,The suspense was thrilling!,"Out of all the books I read by R.L. Stine, this is one the best ever. If you like hair raising, stomach churning action, you'll love this book! I would recomend it to anyone."
1,Keep your receipt - you'll need it!,"I was really excited about getting a new iPAQ 2215 - I'd shopped long and, I thought, carefully. I've been very disappointed with it, though.The large button in the center broke within a week. Then, after I'd had it about two months, it broke completely. I was staring right at it and it shut down, never to turn on again.I'm not generally rough on things - my last handheld was a Palm Vx that I bought around 1999. It still works, so I don't think the breakage was due to me.Keep your recipt! Or, better yet, choose a different handheld."
1,battery is very bad,This product has one BIG flaw. If the battery goes dead everything is lost. The back up battery does not work. There is no way to protect yourself if you remove the battery unless you back up daily. The battery case opens often and the battery falls out. I have lost data so many times that I am replacing this product. I like all the other features. The battery problem is a deal breaker.
2,HP iPAQ 2215 Pocket PC Review,"It looks like a great product, however the stupid shipper (Purple Lady) did not send the owners manual, and I cannot get it to work with Windows 7 Professional. To buy a manual online cost $45.......on top of the price I paid for the original unit. Bad investment all the way around.And, unit and this technology is so old, not much useful information is available on the web."
1,"seems like a great device, but if sync doesn't work","you're in trouble. and for customer service, be prepared to read a hundred screens and waste hours. I got partial sync only, and in the end, my error message wasn't even listed after hours of trying to clear it up. If it doesn't work right off the bat, beware."
3,Good but not perfect,"It works well most of the time, but I have received static and fuzz in reception. Maybe one of the better transmitters, however it is not as good as previously mentioned."
1,Sounds like the ocean,"I bought this because my Chevy Blazer CD player is dying. I thought I could use it with an mp3 Player and it would save me carrying around a bunch of CD's in my car. What a mistake!. It transmits incredibly annoying waves of static every 2-3 seconds on all eight of the preset channels, none of which are in use locally. In a city where there are stations near those frequencies I'm sure it would be worse. Even my best MP3 players (Sansa e260 and Creative Zen) sound terrible unless running at near max volume and with the car stereo turned up to 8. Wasted money."
4,No Tales!,"Customer, listen! This is a book full of wonderful pieces of art, covers in abundance etc. But there are definitely _no_ Tales of Terror, as I foolishly presumed...."
5,Best sub I've ever owned,This thing is a beast. It's got power to spare and the ability to finely tune it to your system. Sound is VERY clean.
1,Just a rehash of Yarnells first book.,"Notice that there is only one other review here besides mine? I like Mark Yarnell but if you already have Your First Year by Yarnell, this book is a waste. Same book different cover. Why the 1 star? Because Yarnell is trying to pass it off as something new and different. Greed is a terrible thing Mark."
1,Weak backing band,If this is the album recorded in Canada in the 70s with a woman singer -besides the interview & a couple of solo Walter #s -the album is pretty weak.
1,Another Faux Lavoe recording,"Ok, I have to admit that the music on this album is of a better quality and that is it, but this is NOT Lavoe! The vocalist here is attempting to imitate Lavoe's voice. I would rather have a singer using his own voice sing any Lavoe songs (example: Cheo Feliciano paid homage to Lavoe singing ""Todo Tiene Su Final""without imitating Lavoe's voice in ""Una Voz Mil Recuerdos"", a great album).Hector Lavoe had a tragic life. There will be many recordings out there that want to pay homage to this great singer. This album is NOT one that does a good job at it.Spend your money wisely and buy the real Lavoe recordings!"
5,For all you Thunders fans...,"...this one is for you. The type of music here is very rock n roll type punk, in the vein of Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers. The songs are varied enough to keep the entire album from feeling too monotonous. Joan Jett even sings a duet on the album. I can't believe nobody has reviewed this album yet. You got tons of attitude, swagger, and the musical chops to back it up."
3,Average Punk,"This album was unimpressive, though admittedly, I'm not a big fan of pure punk. In fact, I only got it because Joan Jett sings on Track 10. Joan Jett is a fantastic performer and does a great job on ""Tearstained Letter""."
2,Meh.,"I don't get all the glowing reviews. Maybe okay for kids, as it's cheap and solid. But I'm not impressed with quality of the point--it makes a really short stubby point like you find on golf pencils that gets dull quickly. Furthermore, no auto-stop, so it's hard to get a perfect point as it wants to keep chewing through the pencil and breaking your new point. Also makes a mess.If you want a quality portable sharpener for a grown-up, go with the Kum long point one:KUM Long Point Pencil Sharpeners"
3,Entertaining,"My 1 year old and his friends could not get enough of this toy for a summer. By the second summer it stopped blowing bubbles and the engine smelled like something burning. oh well, I'm still buying another. It was worth every penny if only for one season."
1,It stopped working after I used it for 2 times,"This product stopped working after I used it for just 2 times. I replaced the batteries as well but of no use. I would not suggest anyone to buy this.In addition to that, this product requires about 10-16 batteries at one time, and eats it up so fast. Please do not buy this."
1,poor quality,"this machine produced an insane amount of bubbles - at first. I took very good care of it, kept it free from dust, cleaned with warm water after each use... but after the 4th use it stopped working. the machine runs, but there are no more bubbles. I think it is a problem with how the pump dribbles the solution over the wands. If I tip it, I might get a little something. I'm very unhappy considering what I paid for it."
3,"Great, short-term fun","I bought this item last summer for my then 1 1/2 year old daughter. She LOVED it, and so did I. I had read the reviews and thought that if I followed the care instructions well ( i.e. cleaning it out after every use, making sure the moter did not get wet, only used the gazillion bubble juice, did not keep it on for more than 15 min at a time) that it would at least last 6 months. I was so wrong. After about 2 1/2 months it just did not work at all anymore. My very handy husband took it apart and found that it is made with a really cheap on/off switch that just gave out. He replaced it with a better switch and it once again worked for about two weeks. After that he found the the wires had just corroded inside the moter from all the bubble juice falling on it from normal use. It is just a poor design and I don't see how anyone will have any better ( or longer ) use out of it than we did."
3,"Good, but needs more couples issues",I thought it was a good devotional but it needs more devotions for couple. I think he focused on a lot of individual issues. I was looking foward to more couples issues.
3,Good watch but poor value now,"I bought one from Amazon 2 years ago at $130+. It has served me well until early this year where the right ""down"" button started to fail due to wear and tear. The audio alert was only working in the initial few months but I could live without it. I wanted to buy another 305 but the price since late 2011 is crazy. I must as well buy a similarly priced 310xt which has a few more useful features like vibration alert and water resistance. Although it is still a good GPS watch, it is not so attractive anymore due to the high price."
4,Track Your Runs,"So far, I have really enjoyed my new Garmin 305. The ability to hold a ""history"" of my runs makes reviewing my training so easy! I would recommend this to anyone in training."
5,Good value and easy to use,"I purchased this for myself to improve my walking/running. It was easy to set up for a non-technical person, and problems I had were clearly addressed in the manual. My elite runner husband was a little jealous that this lower priced-model had features he did not have in an older, more expensive one. Tracking my pace just by looking at the dial has already encouraged me to speed up, so for me it is an ideal tool for a semi-beginner to use to improve."
2,Not Long Term Reliable...,"When it works, it is great.But...Allows water/perspiration incursion through ""speaker"" holes, erodes contacts, watch eventually fails. Do google search on dead Forerunner 305, you'll see. Save your money, don't do it."
4,Garmin forerunner 305,"Very easy to use and the display is easy to view while running. The mapping featuring only shows main streets - I would like it to show all streets. Overall the watch is great, links to the computer easily and is simple to use."
5,Happy with purchase,This is the training and GPS watch that I have been needing to track where I walk. Heart Monitor is just a plus.
5,Love it...,great training tool. I wish I had it when I was training for my marathon. Can't wait to decrease my pace time thanks to the display on the watch.
4,Love It!,"Well, I am recently new to the world of running and am trying to track my continued progress. My coach had one of these watches and I thought I would give it a go. It is so easy to operate and tells me all the stats I am interested such as my pace, elevation, heart rate and total minutes. So happy I bought this product and even happier at the price I paid for it!"
4,Great Device To Help Train For My First Marathon!,I purchased the Garmin 305 to help me train for my first marathon. Its a great device with many very useful features. Users of all skill levels will find something helpful/useful with the 305. I can honestly say that the 305 helped me finish my first marathon. Its a cool device.
5,Must have for runners...,I absolutely love my forerunner 305! I was not a serious runner until I decided that I was going to run the Marine Corp Marathon this year. When I first started training I had to drive my routes to guage my miles. I had no idea how to monitor my heart rate and tracking my runs on paper was time consuming. Now I just push start on my forerunner and run. The forerunner tracks just about everything.I've read some reviews about inconsistencies with satellites but I must say my forerunner locates satellites within seconds of turning it on. It has never lost a signal (even when I run tree lined trails) I can customize my training sessions and track my progress with easy to read software. Just sync the forerunner to your computer and all your run data is downloaded.This item is a must have if you are training for any type of running race.
5,Does the trick,Great watch. Does everything I need. Little more bulky than the newer models but if you can get past that then its a great buy.
2,No Calories indoors??????,"One of my favorite methods of cross-training is spin class. Much to my dismay, I have learned that this monitor will NOT calculate calories if the GPS is not running! So if you want to have a calorie reading on any indoor activity, spin, treadmill, eliptical, you are out of luck. What a major disappointment."
4,Great motivator,I use this to monitor and track my runs. Heart rate and pace are very helpful. I have also used it to find my way back while visiting areas. Great training tool.
4,Does everything I wanted,"I wanted to be able to get my mileage from my trail runs, and also heart rate information from my runs for training purposes. I like the product, it give me everything I wanted. The only drawback is the www.motionbased.com link that you can use free as part of this, only gives you access to the last 10 activities on your list. To see all your activities in this interface is to pay a costly monthly, or yearly fee. I really would like a more in depth software (running log) that incorporates the data from the Garmin, shoe mileage, report capabilities etc. that I only have to pay for one time (I'm a tight scotsman, and hate to pay monthly)."
5,Fantastic training tool - even for a novice runner!!!,"This is an absolutely fantastic product, and well worth the price tag (Amazon does have the best price as of Nov 07). I have recently taken up running (48 yr old male, 200 lbs) and this was my my personal reward for breaking the 4-mile barrier after starting running in Sept 07.It's great because it gives very accurate mileage, tracks heart rate, and the info can be exported to Google Earth so you can visually plot your runs! It has auto settings to give you average pace, it can reset each lap automatically (so you know how fast you've run each mile on a long run), and keeps track of a wealth of info you can export directly into your computer via USB.Whether you buy it or not...keep running!"
2,hrm,"Battery life appears to be too short - while trying to learn to use it just for heart rate, I ended up recharging the battery 2x. Maybe it will be better when I figure out how to use it - however, I have lost the manual that came with it."
5,Garmin Forerunner 305,"I have used the Forerunner 305 a dozen times. A couple 5k runs and the other times indoors on a treadmill and bike trainer. So far it's great. At first it felt a little bulky on my wrist but since it's not a problem. Loading the software to the computer was easy. The transfering of info to the computer is also very easy, just plug in the USB cable to the computer and the 305 into the cradle, it'a all automatic. It's very easy to switch between modes, and also to set up the display to customize what you want to see. I'm very happy I purchased the 305."
5,Great GPS Watch!,"I purchased this GPS watch to track my runs for an upcoming half marathon. Not only is it easy to use, but it has many additional features that have helped me improve my times. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to track their runs accurately and in real-time."
5,Great training aid,Works as promised. It's not as complicated as it looks and is a huge step up from Nike+ and Adidas micoach products.
4,one main flaw,"..is that the heartrate appears in very small font at the right corner which makes it impossible to read when running. There is no disply option that I have found that would allow me to look at the heartrate in a bigger font screen center. I think they tried to fix this in a later model. Bummer!Overall, I like this product."
4,Garmin Forerunner 305,It does the job as advertised for a reasonable price. Good degree of customisation of the indicators that you would see during your activity.The Garmin Training Centre software that it comes with is really basic and may be adequate for some. You would however likely be sourcing for another software that can do some serious analysis of the data that the Forerunner produces.
4,Very nice,Very nice watch. It has a lot of fetures to customize your workout. Only thing I don't like is that it won't use your heart rate to calculate caleries burnt. Other then that i really like it
2,Garmin Forerunner 305 w/Heart Rate,"I purchased this unit primarily for use as a heart rate monitor -- but it seemed to have a lot of ""nice"" features in addition. It is far to complex for my intended use. The unit is heavy, I would hate to have to try and wear it as a runner! The readout for HR was too small and too difficult to set up. I have returned this unit and will purchase a much simpler HR unit from the wide selection on Amazon."
5,Excellent Quality,"I have been a GPS addict for about 10 years now and I have owned about 6 Garmin GPS's. This is another great adition to my collection and an excellent training tool. The ability to set up work outs and schedule them ahead of time is great. If motivation is low, it is great to be able to race an old run or just set a pace to stick with! Secondly, the heart rate strap is the best I have seen, and works well with other indoor machines. It's quality far surpasses that of the polar strap my Dad uses. I highly recomend this product!"
1,Annoying and unreliable,"You have to have an extra hour to let this thing catch a satellite signal. Standing around looking stupid while the bar loads, gets close, then falls back. Totally frustrating. I have had it 2 years and today it just wouldn't pick up any signal at all."
3,Mixed Results,"I've had the Forerunner for over a month now, and have mixed opinions. The features seem fine, and performance (when the GPS finally boots up) is great. Four main criticisms: (1) the GPS will sometimes take several minutes to locate satellites, and sometimes does not at all; (2) battery life not so hot - supposed to be ten hours, but hasn't worked that way for me, even w/ a new unit (and charging on USB does not seem to work); (3) controls are not very intuitive; (4) it's a bulky unit, but I knew that when I bought it.On the other hand, the computer software was easy to install, easy to use, and informative. It's my first GPS trainer, but my high hopes have been let down a bit."
5,Greatest running companion on the market.,"I've had my Garmin forerunner 305 for nearly a week, and can say it's the greatest technological running product on the market. I recieved the forerunner, charged it and began running. No setup required! Very easy to use, software installed in one or two minutes, and I was able to began analyzing my previous run. This thing revealed information about my run, heart rate, elevation, grade, pace, and speed I never new was available.Heart monitor works great and is really quit comfortable. Comes with great software, easy to use, and Motionbased free account, I couldn't ask for more. Stop running blind and go get one of these things, their worth EVERY PENNY."
5,305 GPS Receiver,I love my Garmin. I use it for trail running mostly. It's a great training tool. The data can be used so many ways.
3,Good Watch... Only Wish It Was More Reliable,"I have had the Garmin Forerunner 305 for little over 11 months. Overall I have to say that I am very pleased with the core functionality of the watch, it has proved to be very helpful during training. My disappointment stems from the reliability of the watch. For example, after 6 months of use the original watch suddenly would no longer switch on. I sent it back to Garmin, who by the way were very helpful, and they agreed to send me a replacement. Unfortunately after 4 months of use the replacement no longer appears to have the ability to locate GPS satellites... I currently have an open support ticket with Garmin. In summary I am quite disappointed with the reliability of the Garmin Forerunner 305.Update 07/04/2011Well once again Garmin customer support proved to be outstanding in responding to my issue. They quickly sent me a replacement unit which hopefully will last longer than the previous two units."
2,Consistent Quality Issues,"My wife and I each have a 305, and I have a number of running partners who own them as well, and every one of us have had a malfunction of the units: buttons that stop working, alerts that won't beep, units that stop functioning altogether. The smallest repair out of warranty, at least in Canada, is $94, and you have to pay $40 up front for them to even look at it, and that is not refundable when they tell you that they can't find anything wrong. When they're working they're great, but be ready to buy a new one every other year."
4,Useful gadget to have,This review probably won't be that helpful to other. Just wanted to say I liked the product. Distance seems accurate. Haven't had any lost signal issues. Heart rate monitor also seems accurate. I like knowing how far I ran or biked without having to map out the route first.
4,Garmin 305,"This is a great product, easy to use and enough information to shake a stick at. Provides really useful information on your running and how to improve it."
4,Garmin 305,"The Garmin 305, Does everything it talks about. It has helped me out alot, it has helps me maintain my speed and right heart rate I wanted. Plus it lets me just run or bike anywhere I want without marking it off prior to the run. It has also got my kids into riding their bikes more so they can come and download it to the internet and see on Google Earh right where we was just at. It is within feet of where you was riding in the road/sidewalk.The only down fall: Wooded areas the GPS doesn't work so good as far as speed.Overall: I love the Garmin 305. I have told many people about it and they have bought it for themselves and they too LOVE IT...."
4,Great running tool,"I struggled trying to decide between the 405 & the 305. After reading many reviews & consulting with my runner friends that owned Garmin watches, I opted for the 305. Many others commented that tho the 405 was sleeker, that it was inferior functionally (reviews with which my friends agreed). Ultimately, I opted for superior performance over looks. After all, I was buying it as a training tool, not to wear as a full-time watch. Although I was concerned about the size (I am petite) being a burden, it really is not an issue, tho I admit that I haven't worn it on any runs in excess of 12mi yet.. I would imagine that the additional weight may be a bit more noticeable on longer distance runs. Overall, a great product."
5,"Easy setup, Lots of features","I found this product to be easy to set up, and chock full of features. You can view your running path as a map, or in 3D. And it keepe trackof all your changes in pace, calories. Very customizable, can even change your pace ranges. Very helpful tool!"
5,Excellent choice,"After a month review of the different choices, I couldn't choosen the best option, price vs. technology. Some comment, it's a little big, but it does much more that size it's not an issue. I started running about 4 month, I just did my first 14K race @ 1:29. I worked under heart rate zones and the monitor really did it job, because I never felt tired. Again excellent option. Try wearing it on the inside of the wrist, it's easier to read."
5,Garmin 305 GPS,This was a perfect item that my daughter wanted for Christmas. She is training for the Boston Run and says that every feature on it is exactly perfect. Purchase this item if you are looking for a great watch - heart for someone.
4,Good but needs to go farther,"Not being a computer expert I still have not learned how to use all its functions. I do wish it had a web site to download it's info to, then I could share the info with my coach, and she could make suggestions too. Kinda like Runners World [...] . Also I have not figured out how to install maps from sources other than the Garmin, Like Trimble Outdoors or Map my ride. Over all I like it, it's comfortable on the wrist although I will install it on the bike, as it's just easer to see on the bar. My daughter has a Polar and on our last ride they were very close in distance and elevation."
5,Garmin Forerunner 305,"I use this mainly for biking and I am using it with the bike mount kit. I LOVE it ! I would recommend this product. I use it for running, too and it is great to have a GPS for running and biking. The workouts load great into the Garmin Training Center and provide a great and convenient record of workouts. This version does not give the elevation on the ride, but I pick it up in the download to the Training Center - having the elevation available on the ride is the ONE FEATURE I wish I had with this product."
5,Garmin 305 Forerunner...an Excellent unit!,"The Garmin Forerunner 305 is an excellent product! Let me first say that once I ordered this online, I received my 305 in 2-days, much sooner than the 4 to 7 day projection I was initially given. I couldn't wait to put my 305 to work. Upon receipt, I set it up by installing the software, set up the custom alerts, etc. This unit comes with the heart monitor, so I wanted to ensure I could set and maintain a ""fat-burning"" target during my 2 to 4 mile runs. I'm still learning my 305 but it is indeed a great unit and I would purchase the next upgrade to this Forerunner 305!"
4,Garmin Forerunner,"This watch is easy to use. It pretty much was a no brainer for basics. I have not had a chance to really ""use"" it to it's abilities as of yet but am hoping to soon. I would recommend this to someone who is definately starting out."
2,Garmin Forerunner 305 Highly Innacurate Mapping Software,I tried uploading some of my routes to one of the mapping software websites and got terrible mapping results. Some parts of the route were off by over 1/4 mile. Their routing of the GPS coordinates were nowhere near the roads that I actually ran on. Has anyone else experienced this bad of a result with their mapping of their routes?
4,Great Purchase,"Very good device for those who like free running, but who also like to measure performace. Great Perchase!"
5,Review of Garmin Forerunner 305,This is a great piece of equipment. It has not lost a signal yet where as my old Forerunner 301 (which I loved) lost the signal on certain runs somewhat frequently. The high sensitivity receiver has made a world of difference. It transitions between the run and the bike feature easily. I love this thing!!!!It also arrived before the anticipated time frame.
4,Beginning runner,I had really just decided to get serious about running when I got the Garmin. It has been a great investment. It has really helped me keep track of time and distances. It allows me to see when I have been doing well and when I have been slacking. It is very helpful in designing a training program for myself. I would definitely recommend this.
2,Beware...,"I've had this watch for about 3 years or so and it has performed average-below average for the price. The GPS is very flaky and in wide-open clear skies with a full charge sometimes cannot get to whatever satellite(s) it need(s). About a month ago, the faceplate of the unit completely separated from the base, making the watch completely non-functional. I have never seen a watch split in half. I don't know what was holding it together (not screws), but whatever it was is now completely gone. Took it to a watch repair specialist and he could not fix it. I have a note in to Garmin but am not expecting anything but where they want me to ship it for 3-4 months and how much it will cost. Will not buy another Garmin..."
3,Ok if you don't do any long training or events,"I had a Garmin Forerunner 201. I loved it, but alas I lost it after a paddling session. So with a lot of remorse I ponied up the extra dough to upgrade to the 305. I really like the heart rate monitor, the ability to create courses, the virtual training partner is a neat gimmick, and the training history and data base is much improved. HOWEVER, all of those extra functional elements cost the user battery charge life. I have found the charge to last about 5 hours tops..You would have to stop your work out to plug in somewhere if you are ever to do any long training or events. Also annoying is the fact that if you happened to hit the lap/reset button at the same time as you hit the mode button, a pretty common thing, you will shut of the power and loose all of your data for that workout! Really bad form! Also the display is small so much of the graphics are microscopic."
4,5 stars with better HR display,"A worthwhile upgrade to the 301. Much better reception (I run the trails in Colorado and have yet to drop a signal, even on cloudy days), smaller (Garmin separated the charging feature, bringing it outside the unit), doesn't pop off (the 301 would pop its hinge when my wrist would bend too far, when getting up for example), and the hr strap is more comfortable. On the downside, the hr display is now too small and is very hard to read on the run, an obvious drawback when training. The only other drawback remains the same as the 301. Garmin's training software is nowhere near as good as Polar's. Not even close. You can use third party vendors, but for the cost, the 305 should come with its own high quality software. However, I think the Garmin is superior to the Polar 625x, and better software is not nearly enough to sway me back to Polar."
4,Must have when you are running,"Changed the way I think when I run, able to see how far I have ran real time and the speed i have ran it."
1,Faulty product,"I was really excited about this but after using it for a month, I wouldn't give it a high recommendation. The main issue is that mine spontaneously shuts off while I'm running - multiple times. The user's manual doesn't give a lot of trouble shooting options, nor could I find a solution on Garmin's website, so I emailed the company and got a two-part answer two days later. I've done step one and my Garmin still has the same problem, so I'll undertake step two and see if that provides a solution. If not, I'll either try to return or I guess I'm stuck with a fairly useless product.Since I also value this type of tool for heart rate function, it would be good if I could read my heart rate without glasses, but the heart rate is displayed in approximately 8 point font in the upper right hand of the device.I am really disappointed with this product overall."
5,Love this watch!,"I have recently start running last year. I used to use my phone bodyrunner which was pain in the butt. I got this watch this year as a mother's day gift from my hubby and I have been using it since! it's very easy to use and very accurate, not like the phone gps which constantly lost signal and have to rerecord my distance from the beginning when I'm half way done which really upsets me! this watch worth every penny spent on it! it's just awesome and actually motivates me to get out of the house and go for a 2 miles jog! I can see my speed and it beeps every time I pass one mile. If you are a short or long distance runner or hiker this watch is for you! I recommend it to everyone and I can't wait to use it for my half marathon run!"
5,love this GPS,I 've been using this product for 5 months and I am really happy with this product. i recommend this product
2,Very unreliable,"I bought a Garmin Forerunner to help me train for running a marathon. The unit is great, and it has been a huge help in training. However, the unit keeps malfunctioning--I am currently on my fourth Forerunner. On Forerunner #1, the GPS went out. On Forerunners #2-4, the device just died, and wouldn't turn on. Or if I could turn it on, it would turn itself off after a short period of time. Luckily I bought it at REI and they have been good about exchanging the device.I really like this device, but I would advice against buying it. Also, Garmin's customer service isn't the best. Once you actually get to speak with someone, they are helpful; however, plan to wait on hold for 45 minutes to an hour."
3,"Okay device, could be much better.","I think the Garmin Forerunner 305 has the potential to really help out a runner but i don't thing the heart rate monitor is very accurate. I've done a manual count after a heavy workout and compared it to the garmin and the garmin is way off by as much as 20 to 30 beats. That bothers me that I'm not get accurate data. Sometimes the heart rate monitor won't even pick up my hear beat, so I spend several minutes during a heavy work out adjusting the band to see if that helps. I wish it would also tell my how many calories I am burning even if I'm not outside working out. It's functional but I wish is was a better device."
5,So glad I got this!,"Love the customizable feature on it that complains when you run too slow! Helped me pass my PT test. If I could change one thing, it would be the sounds it makes - reminds me of a 1970s-era video game. But that is such a minor thing. Otherwise, very happy with this purchase!"
3,Great Watch Except for a Little Problem,"I've had my Garmin 305 for about three years, and it died. The interval alarms started to fade away, and then the watch began to collect water from my sweat. I actually saw the water gradually start to take over the screen. I'm a long distance runner. After doing Google searches, I found that the Garmin 305 has a flaw: the holes in the speakers will collect sweat and then corrode the system. That's what happened. Some of my running friends have had 305s for a couple of years, and the same problem is starting to happen to them. Overall, if the watch was on a major sale, I'd buy one to last another three years and plug the speaker holes. Right now, I'm in the market for a new watch."
3,"Great features, but bulky","This GPS watch has every feature that you could imagine. It was really nice to be able to see 4 data fields on the display at the same time and custom choose each one. However, it is even more bulky than I expected. I used it for a few runs and just could not stand the size of it. I returned it and got a smaller, newer, Garming GPS (the 405)."
4,Garmin 305 - very good GPS sports watch priced under $180.,"I first bought this item on 2006 when it first came out. I think at the time I overpaid for it around $350. It lasted for a couple of years. After having gone through the 405CX since that time (not a very good experience), this year, I went back to this old Garmin that I am familiar with. Reliable as far as GPS signal, the functional keys are not easy to press but you don't have to press them during workouts or races so that is not a big disadvantage. There is a good online tool that syncs with it as well for tracking your workouts. Good product overall."
2,Not what I expected it to be...,"I confess I may not understand how this thing completely works. But, the reasons I'm not happy with this product are: the watch doesn't seem to stay charged very long. And, I bought this to use on extended hiking trips (overnights)... and wanted the GPS for my own safety. Secondly,if you are a woman with small wrists... this watch is HUGE. Very clunky. But, in it's defense... most of the GPS watches are too big for small wrists. If I had seen this watch at the store... I would not have bought it."
5,Garmin Review,this is revolutionary for my runs! i can't believe i went so long without it. it is much worth the purchase!
1,Upload Issues,"This watch does everything great except for data uploads which makes it nearly useless. You can eventually get your runs to upload but it typically takes 5-10 attempts (about 15 minutes). The problem has been noted dozens of times on Garmin's home site as well as other blogs accross the internet. In the Garmin Forums, the Garmin reps suggest checking your connections, clearing cache, re-booting, adding Garmin to your secure sites then if you do not give up, they tell you to contacting support. I have never seen the issue resolved and Garmin Support acts like this is the first time they have seen this issue.I thought I got a great deal on this watch on Amazon. You get what you pay for I guess."
4,Great watch,"I really enjoy using the Garmin, it is very easy to see while running. I only wish it was less bulky."
4,garmin forerunner 305 wrist=mounted gps computer with heart rate monitor,WORKS WELL...A LITTLE SLOW FINDING SATELLITES..OVERALL VERY ENJOYABLE ..DOES WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO..GP
4,"I got it for my dad, seems to work well","i got it for my dad who runs marathons annually, sweet price, seems to work well"
5,does the job!,"Help pace me and gave me total distance! After 13 miles, my wrist was a little bruised."
4,What a difference!,"I use to use the Polar RS200 heart rate monitor with the footpod and just recently upgraded to the Garmin Forerunner 305. What a difference! The Forerunner 305 is much more precise, provides much more information on the screen and the heart rate monitor band is much more confortable. Great product even though satellites acquisition could be faster"
4,Excellent,Great product overall. Highly recommend. Purchasing the more expensive watches is not necessary. Forerunner 205 and 305 are excellent. I have experienced two minor issues. 1) Occassionally satelite finder is delayed and slow. When it occurs--Resolve by powering down watch and restart. 2) Rubber wrist strap is a little uncomfortable..may look into a replacement. Garmin Connect service online is a great tool also--Access anywhere following upload of activities on the web. thanks for the great price Amazon...
2,Worked OK for a week,"The Garmin 305 GPS watch provided good service while it worked. After three runs within a week, the watch stopped working. Pressing the power button would not power on the watch. I tried the soft and hard reset procedure that I found on the Garmin site. No luck. When I connected the watch to the charger cradle, the display would show the charging message for about three seconds and then it would display the fully charged message. I tried powering on the watch while it was in the charging cradle. This worked until I took it off the cradle. Then it shutdown again. I even left it powered on overnight in the cradle. Again, once I took it off the cradle, it died. Packed it back up and sent it back to Amazon. Going to try the Garmin 110 now."
3,Calorie counter totally inaccurate,"I wanted a watch that would measure HR, calories burned, distance, pace. Since I'm trying to lose a few pounds having an accurate calorie count is extremely important...this device is WAY, WAY off! Totally useless for that. Other areas measured seem to be ok...but why advertise a feature that doesn't even work correctly?! It's false advertising in my opinion! I won't buy another Garmin device!"
4,Good for the price,"I like my Garmin. It is easy to use. At times I think it lags and I'm not sure I trust the pace as being extremely accurate. I'm sure I'm not running as fast as it says at times but in the end when I download, it seems to be right on. For the price I feel I got a good deal and it is helping my training. It has all the bells and whistles needed."
4,Great gadget,"I found this to be very user friendly. I am not that handy with gadgets but was able to use many of the features of this without help. The pace reading doesn't change as quickly as I as hoping but it is possible that I simply haven't figured out which settings to change for that yet. You can set it to beep at specdific distances, speed ranges, or heart rate choices. You might not be able to hear the beeps if you're listening to music while running (but there may be a volume setting bu there does not seem to be. . It's easy to set up, the menus are clear, and the features are useful. It would be perfect if the heartrate display was 3 to 4 times larger for quick glances and the side buttons were easier to press. It is well worth the money in my opinion."
2,The perfect fitness device for me!,"Originally I gave the watch a five star review, however, after 15 months the watch stopped working. The warranty is only for 12 months... I'd only used the watch for running; and I'd ran less than 50 runs. I loved the watch, but not its lifespan and the warranty."
2,Not for use in the Gym,"Note: I'm writing this for my wife the gym-ratIf you intend to use this only out-doors it's great (if not a bit oddly bulky It records paths and monitors many functions as well as lots of great garmin products. The caveat here is that it has no ability to record how far you have gone if you are running on a treadmill.Had to go back to Polar with the foot pod. Should have researched it's limitations more, sent it back."
5,wonderful product,"The price was right and the item was in perfect condition, just as it said. I had no problems whats so ever with the payment and mailing. Wonderful product. So easy to use. If you have used any of the earlier models it is exactly the same format. the 305 gives you more information and the program that goes along with it is outstanding. Even if you arn't an avid runner, the 305 can help you with other sports and walking. I'm telling you this is an awesome product. I stared with the 201 and I had that for 3 years, I thought I would never need or want anything else. But the difference between the two is huge. trust me on this one, spend the extra money and get the 305."
3,"Good watch, useless heart rate monitor","I just received the Garmin FR 305 device 2 weeks ago and I was really anxious to using it.I love the running related features, it helps me a lot keep the pace, verify the distance, keep the timing so I remember to finally go home. I enjoyed it in the mountains as well, elevation measurements providing relatively accurate information.One major dislike - the Heart Rate Monitor is not working at all, out of the box. I tried with a different battery, I forced the scan a couple of times. Absolutely no luck.One ""good"" news is that the wrist watch detects the HRM from a friend, so I isolated the issue.I hope Amazon/Garmin support will help me solve the issue."
2,"Ok while working, failed after 9 months","The heart monitor reading is too small to read when you really want to control your activities. Distance measurement was OK. BUT, after 9 months it simply failed, the reset recommended by Garmin did not help, and their service offered to try and fix it for 79$! without shipping. This is an overpriced old technology. Buy a simple HRM, and wait for GPS to be more efficient and cheaper on cell phones."
4,This works with Linux too,"So often I wonder when buying a product like this if it will work with Linux. The short answer is yes it does. Install pyTrainer and GPSbable and your good to go.The watch itself is good too. It has more feature than I had time to explore. I use it to chart my run times and distances. When used on a Linux box it will track your path on google maps and keep daily / Monthly / Yearly workouts and allow you to graph your heart rate, distances, times, and elevation change. The only downside is that the watch is a little bulky.A note on the Heart Rate Monitor: It has to be moist to work. This is no problem once you get going and warm up, but it's spotty at best until you heat up."
4,Good product when you get a working model,"The first one that I received was defective. The Enter key kept getting harder and harder to push until it quit working altogether. The heart rate monitor came with a dead battery. Even after replacing the battery, the watch would not pair with heart rate monitor. The Second one I received work wonderfully and I am enjoying its functionality.However I am starting to wonder about Garmin's quality control. I have recently received the cadence sensor and it too is defective. I am awaiting its replacement."
2,meh..,"Not the best crossdressing manga [or manhua] out there, frankly. The artwork is fair, if you're an aestheticist, and the plot is kind of contrived. Entertaining enough [I guess] for a light read, but not too much substance in this one. I haven't bothered with the second volume; it might pick up, I don't know."
4,"Not a blackwing, but still pretty good","The Blackwing 602 is revered as the finest pencil ever made. The Mirado Black Warrior rates near-legendary, and provide a very nice writing experience. The lead is just right, with a smooth action over the paper coupled with a nice, smudge-resistant mark. All in all I'm very happy. If you love wood pencils the way I do, you'll enjoy these."
3,"Great pencil, poor eraser","The design of these pencils makes them superior to the basic yellow pencils I usually buy in large quantities. The lead doesn't break when I sharpen it, which happens too frequently with the yellow ones. But the eraser on these pencils is awful. When I use the eraser sometimes on only the second or third try, very often it crumbles on me. This would be a great pencil except for this very important flaw."
3,Would be five stars if it had an excellent eraser,"I like the color and quality of the pencil but the Pink Pearl eraser is dry, stiff and doesn't erase completely. I can get pencils from the dollar store with better erasers."
5,they are as good as everyone writes,I have loved these pencils for almost 5 years. I missed them when I left my last job. I can't wait to order boxes of them.
1,Awful product,"Frankly, I am astounded that someone can find this adapter usable. I got it today, put it in and had to immediately cover my ears. This was without a doubt the worst sound quality I've ever experienced. The charger does not even come close to fitting my Rio Carbon. All plugs are round and I needed a square one (USB connector). What a disappointment!"
1,This is a bootleg,"Bootleg, and a rotten transfer to boot. Amazon should protect their buyers from these illegal dupes."
4,"Very good mechanical pencil, cheap","These 0.7mm pencils are comfortable to hold and work very well. I got them for wood working as one of the rules I use has small (0.7 to 1mm) marking holes. Its easy to break the lead but that's not a problem with the pencil. I would have given these 5 stars, especially with the low price, but not surprisingly they are cheaply made and tend to be easy to break--particularly the clip.I was bemused by one reviewer who went off about them being a pencil! Well if you don't want/need a pencil don't buy them! Really off topic.Excellant value, recommended!"
3,inconsistent grip on lead,"My first box of these was great -- perfect smooth-writing cheap pencils. However, a second box contains several pencils which do not grip the lead well: the lead slips back in the pencil if you push down to write. The lead is the original lead which came in the pencil. I don't think I will chance buying these again, given there are other similar options. Sorry, BIC!"
3,Makeup,i think this assortment is mostly for tweens-teens. i was actually happy with this order but.....and i got 24 things in the package
2,NOT for beginners,"I purchased the tape with hopes I could get somewhere with AE, but this tape is only for people who have already had some experience with AE. Taz goes on a lightning pace, losing any beginning AE user within the first few minutes."
3,cute pencil grips,"My 8-year old was delighted at first, but quickly discovered that these grips are too large for most of her pencils. The pencils (both the usual yelow #2 and the ones with pictures handed out as party favors everywhere) slipped right through the grip. Too bad! The grips have a nice amount of softness/give/support. I guess if you wrap a pencil in a layer of masking tape the grip will sit more firmly."
2,Not very good...,"I have listened to Christian Music for years. I usually figure that I will have to learn to like some cd's because the talent pool for C music is very small comparitively. I tried to get through the whole disc, but stopped it and didn't try again. Take it for what its worth, I just didn't dig their style."
4,OLDIES,I love oldies. This disc helps to complete my collection. I still need to get a few more. I need to listen to them more though.
5,Amazing,This product is wonderful! It reduces redness and swelling very quickly to improve the health and appearance of your face.
4,A great easy reading book,"I got this book as my ""eat at lunch break"" book... It was perfect for that. When I was done eating, I could just put it away - it didn't have any big hard to keep track of sequences. Light reading.On the other side of the coin, each day at lunch, I got a little smile knowing that I was going back into this book. I was never bored with it - something that happens too often it seems.It has surprises, humor, things to think about, action, and sci-fi. What else can you ask for?"
1,No conflict whatever,"Okay, why do so many like this book? In the first half there is zero conflict. Zero. Finally, after all the false conflict of basic training and pages of sassy, ""funny"" and glib dialog about meals, having sex (imagine that!) and did I mention having sex? And while we're on the subject of sex, it's sex without meaning, sex without eroticism, sex that's just going through the motions (like the rest of the book) then we finally get to the first big battle scene and... and... Pffffffffffft goes the air out of the balloon. No one is in any real danger. It's a turkey shoot. That's where I gave up. When you can read half a book and not care if the main character lives or dies, then it's time to, as Dorothy Parker suggests, hurl the book with great force. If you want an involving SF story, CONFLICT and maybe even a character you will care about, try any earlier Jack Vance orSisters of Glass."
1,Bad Cursing,"There are good Science Fiction writers out there that don't curse Jesus name in vain through their Characters over and over again. I'm a couple hours into the audio book and they rip it pretty good in this book, I'll not buy Scalzi again.Just letting any who care about this know."
1,I thought I was getting a Sci-Fi book!,"Actually, the first chapter had a rather novel premise. A couple pages into the second chapter I threw the book into the trash. I will not stand for subliminally being preached to. Far, far too many references to religion and god. I wanted Sci-Fi not mythical fantasy. Caveat emptor."
4,Heinlein's Heir,"An enjoyable homage to Starship Troopers. Seems strangely dated in some ways, such as its treatment of homosexuality. The focus is definitely on the realities of war and not the fabulous technology of the Colonial Union."
3,Fun,This was fun and almost suitable for my teen sons to read....almost.The protagonist was just too perfect and unbelievable. The concept was fun and I would be willing to read more by this author.
4,"A fun, quick read",Like the title it's a fun book to read and interesting. I found myself reading the whole book within two days as I couldn't put it down. The influences are obvious as others have mentioned but the author manages to keep it fresh and different enough that I never felt like I was reading a Heinlein knock off novel.
3,Nice little read,"This was a nice little read. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Entertaining.Not overly thought-provoking but, on occasion, you just like to have some fun.Well - people dieing right and left and truly horrible aliens but... fun nonetheless.My only real problem was that I wasn't ""disgusted"" enough by those aliens. For some reason, they just didn't scare me enough.Oh well. Liked it so much I ordered the rest of the series.I call this kind of read ""before bedtime books."" I'll have 4 more of them in a few days!DL"
5,A Fast Paced and Colorful Read,"Old Man's War is modern science fiction at its best. In a time where the greatest writers are focusing on pumping out massive space operas with intricate plot lines and thousands of pages of content, John Scalzi gets back to the basics. The protagonist John Perry has nothing more to live for and gets whisked away into an adventure he never thought possible. He goes from an insignificant citizen of Earth to a key figure in the fight for humanity's very existence in a universe full of dangerous aliens and perilous worlds. Scalzi paints an incredible universe that keeps the reader intrigued with a plot that is briskly developed and quick witted dialog. I found myself rooting for Perry the entire story actually feeling for him during certain situations.If you are a fan of science fiction or a fan of adventure at all, give this book a read."
4,A highly entertaining work of sci-fi,"I read this book when John made an early version available online, and it's excellent. Exciting, thought-provoking, even (as once was said of Paula Zahn) a little bit sexy. A great buy for any sci-fi fan."
3,ENTERTAINING,But too short! Scalzi IS always fun to read but I do prefer books that take more than an hour to read...
3,"Fun Read, but not Outstanding","Good book. However, a web review I read said, ""Scalzi's book is lots of fun. But a better recent homage to Starship Troopers is Robert Buettner's new novel, Orphanage, about an angry asocial outcast who joins the military to fight an alien assault on earth. Orphanage is funny, thoughtful, and vastly more intense than Scalzi's book."" I agree, and Orphanage costs ten bucks less."
4,Great Read,"I picked up a copy of ""Old Man's War"" last month and added it to a pile of books I intended to read before Christmas, needless to say one I started this fantastic tale I coudn't put it down. This one one great read, not a classic like Dune or LOTR, but OMW is one of those kinds of books that just grabs you and won't let go. Very well written with great, realistic characters and a story that could be all to real in our future.A great mix of comedy, realism, and combat action, all from the perspective of an old man in a young mans body. I'm not usually sorry to reach the end of a book but with OMW I was left wanting more. Highly recomended."
3,There can be more than one reason for the air to be blue,"This was a very good book. It only got three stars because of the never ending profanity all the way through the book. I mean, it was every couple of pages (every page ???) and the profanity added nothing. It wasn't even like his Momma failed to wash his mouth out with soap when he was growing up. It wasn't shock value. You could take a marker and black out the profanity and the book would improve, not be worse, except for all the little magic marker spots throughout the book. An occasional swear word, appropriately placed, can sometimes add something to the context, or even make you have a good long laugh because of the dialogue and the word fitting so well.A writer should write so the words add something to the book, not detract from it."
4,It was just getting good.,"The book was just getting good when it was rather abruptly over. Scalzi established the characters fairly well, the rules, the universe, etc. and then ended it, that's why I only gave 4 stars. Other than that, GREAT sci-fi military fiction on par with Heinlein and others, and a unique concept of using older people's experience with new bodies. I probably need to crack open the next book in the series."
5,Fantastic!,"I don't read fiction for the most part. It doesn't do much for me, and I can't usually stay with one fiction work (other than the classics) long enough to finish it. I INHALED this one. It's probably the best sci-fi text I've ever read. It's full of interesting scientific concepts, the situations are explained enough to be plausible and thought-provoking, and you quickly become attached to the main character.Even if you don't do fiction, give this one a try. You won't regret it."
4,A good book,"It has been a while since I read something truely interesting. OLD MAN'S WAR fits the bill. This book is a recipe of sorts -- a little bit of STARSHIP TROOPERS, a bunch of ugly aliens with bad tempers, some modern science and green soldiers.The basic idea is the Colonial Defence Forces need bodies, but they don't want just anyone. They're looking for the old, the haggard, the somewhat infirmed. That's right you can't sign up until you're 75. Then it is off the vast reaches of the universe to squash bugs or get killed in some very vicious ways.The best recommendation I can make is that I am working my way through the sequel right now."
4,Another Hit by Scalzi,"After reading Old Mans war, i was highly anticipating this. However I waited a while before reading this because personally I like to take a break between reading multiple novels in a series, lets me feel refreshed towards reading it. Anyway, this book again exceeded my expectations, as I generally don't read much science fiction. Yes, I would agree with most that it doesnt reach the same heights as old mans war, but thats OK, because that book was amazing. This book is as well, It just isn't AS good as old mans war. Once again, Scalzi writes this book at a quick pace which makes it highly entertaining and fits well with the subject matter. A big thing I like about reading Scalzi novels is the humor. Every time i read a scalzi book i know there are going to be some laugh out loud moments, and this is no different. The action is great, the comedy is there and the plot is fun. Pick this up, and don't compare it to old mans war. Just enjoy this book for the fun that it is."
4,great read,"This book was very enjoyable - loved the concept. It's not 'deep fiction' and the protagonist is a little too good to be true and the insights he has during the book (that are crossroads for the character) are ones that surely others before him would have had - so maybe he's made to be too good regarding insights that aren't entirely reaching the epiphany status that you expect to be realistic. But using this character to explore this reality worked well regardless. It seemed to end rather suddenly unfortunately - it could of gone a lot further, but the stage is set. It's a great read and i recommend it. Humour, imagination and the concept give it 4 stars."
4,Good Book,"Entertaining book, I picked this up from a recommendation on Amazon and enjoyed it. You can definitely see the paralells to Haldeman and Heinlein, but this book stand on it's own and doesn't feel forced. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book which is being released in a few weeks."
4,Great Story,I read this book during the summer at the beach and couldnt put it down. It is very interesting if you like science fiction. The theme of the book is very plausable. I high suggest this for a pleasent getaway read.
5,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed the characters, the sense of teamwork, the introduction to new (to me) science fiction concepts, a new universe with continually new aliens and the happy ending."
2,Not for post 1993 fans,"If you got into Pulp with His n' Hers or the subsequent albums, you will not really enjoy this album. All songs are acoustic. Except for Jarvis, none of the current band members are on this album. While by itself it is a decent album, in comparison to the Pulp we know and love, it fizzles. If you want good Pulp, go post '93."
1,...,"(...)These lyrics sound like a 19 year old talking about things he's read about in books, but never experienced. Imagine Spandau Ballet's lyrics being sang by a happy Ian Curtis with The Smiths(minus morrissey and on a heavy dose of sedatives)supplying the music. These are not the quality ramblings of a (...)"
2,Problematic CD,"While no one can deny that these tracks are big hits, it makes little difference when you hear the CD. The sound quality is poor, at times almost distorted, as are many of the ""Oldies But Goodies"" CDs that are available through the label. Get these songs elsewhere and you'll save yourself a big headache, literally."
1,Horrible! I want my money back,"I am a big fan of the Tenjou/Tenjho Tenge anime and was pleased to hear that the manga was coming out. I went out and bought it the same day. I had seen samples from the japanese GN's and was ready for some high-flying action, along with a lot of fanservice. However this version of TenTen was so HORRIBLY MANGLED! Every last nude shot or panty shot has been edited out and the manga has been given a teen rating instead of the mature rating it deserves. A character's rape is oddly downplayed, as is some racial stereotyping (make your own minds about that one). My opinion tends to be the general opinion of the anime community all over the internet. However, Dark Horse has refused to release a statement regarding this travesty and are continuing to release a mature manga to a teen demographic. Do yourself a favour and just watch the anime or buy the original Japanese releases."
4,GREAT SOUND,"I have a small sound production company, and own 3 of these. All 3 are plagued with a volume control that produces static when you turn it up or down. Other than that, the sound is unbelievable. I have used this over seas with a battery to DJ for 50 people, to using for sound for a presentation with an multimedia projector."
4,Great value.,"The sharpener I got works wonderfully. I'm trying to find another for work. It seems like the Seattle reviewer reviewed a different sharpener; because I don't see any of those problems. Mine works well, on the higher quality graphite pencils. It does chew up cheaper ones, because they are cheap! Low quality wood composites... not real wood. Definitely a good value, as far as I am concerned."
5,To The Nines!,"I bought this CD yesterday when it came out and was completely blown away! I have always been a big fan of Good Riddance, and when I heard (Russ) the lead singer was going to be leading this new project I was stoked. Also in the line up is Bill Stevenson, the Descendents drummer, and the guitarist from Bane. These musicians combined give you and awesome combination of melodic hardcore punk. They sound like a cross between Good Riddance with Offspring style backup vocals (they way they are set up) and a completely original sound all in one. If you like any bands on Fat Wreck Chords you should really give this a shot, it's not going to dissapoint!"
2,Not 100% cotton,"Still well cut, thinner, and a cotton/poly blend that doesn't wear well in several ways. Not remotely as good as the old ones. I'm looking for a new brand."
1,Product misrepresented,"Product is advertised as 100% cotton, but the shirt label claims 52% polyester. I don't do polyester. Very disappointed, and returned the shirts."
4,T's for Seniors,"These shirts are a good choice for me, age 78, since they are all cotton, a bit longer which works for outside the trousers, and have a pocket. I have trouble finding them at my normal retailer and Amazon's connections seem to produce results first time. Good shirts at a good price."
1,Russell Athletic Men's Pocket Tee NOT what I expected.....,I've bought this tee in the past and it was a wonderful thick cotten....was shocked when I received these that they were paper thin. I returned.
1,Can't Handle High Volume Output,"Bought a STR-DE885 brand new 4 years ago. Connected it to three Mirage Omnisat speakers (left and right surround and center channel), as well as a Sony 150W powered subwoofer. I learned very quickly that the receiver cannot handle high volume for sustained periods of time...at 75% volume, it will go into ""Protector"" mode after 20 - 30 minutes of sound output. Took it into an authorized Sony Service Center and was informed by their technician that this receiver is highly vulnerable to overheating and easily jumps into Protector mode. So, instead of using it as my home entertainment center receiver, I had to move it into the master bedroom and go buy a Denon receiver that can handle the volume I want. I'll never buy another Sony receiver."
1,The Black Swan,Hard to rate as I could not watch it. But thank you for responding to me my query and refunding my money.
3,A Good Swashbuckler,"THE BLACK SWAN(1942)---Tyrone Power, Maureen O'Hara, Laird Cregar, Thomsa Mitchell, George Sanders, Anthony Quinn, George ZuccoAn ""all out"" swashbuckler starring Tyrone Power ""swashing and buckling"" all over the place. Filmed in beautiful Technicolor. Maureen O'Hara is stunning as the ""love interest"" for Power. Thomas Mitchell plays an incorrigible, but lovable, ""buccaneer"", a la Long John Silver! George Sanders gives a good performance as a ""brigand"", and Laird Cregar and George Zucco play English noblemen/government officials plagued by Power and his band of ""rowdies"". If you like ""swashbucklers"", then this film is one you'll enjoy---it's a lot of fun!"
4,spooky,"a different kind of thriller. creepy, eerie, takes it's time, a European-like horror film. if you're looking for cheap horror, this is not it. it's atmospheric & bizarre. effective, fairly scary portrayal of how things disintegrate little by little into meaninglessness and paranoia when someone is insane. Recommended."
1,Don't spend the money!,It's a good read but they advertise all this free stuff you'll have access to once you go to their Website. The problem is... they don't have a Website! Buyer Beware!
5,DON'T BUY this version of this book. The workbook DOES NOT exist.,"Hi all,Last year I purchased all rights to all versions of The Lazy Man's Way to Riches. I soon discovered that this version does NOT have the corresponding workbook available. IT NO LONGER EXISTS and I am not able to provide it. Sorry for any inconvenience.Thank you,Phil AmmendoliaManagerThe Lazy Man's Way to Riches[...]"
5,"Excellent, a bit quirky",Most of what I have to say has been done in the other reviews. I just hope that there is a volume II someday.
3,Baby Pooh Mobile,"This is a nice item. It is easy to assemble and even easier to attatch to the crib which makes it easy to move around if you wish. Music is okay. I wish it played more than one tune, but Baby likes it just the way it is."
5,Nice shirts!,"Nice polos, 65 poly 35 cotton...very nice feel and at the same time it lets you breath..very comfortable and sizes feel true!"
3,Meh...,"Sure, they are floor mats for less than $20, so I really shouldn't expect much. They seem quite durable, but they don't fit super well in my 2005 Corolla, however. Usable, but they very obviously look like a one-size-fits-all type solution. Oh well, I'll probably go buy another set once these ones get too dirty."
3,Thinner better? Not in this case.,"You may not be able to see through them if held up to a light, but they are significantly thinner than the set that they are replacing. They still offer protection, but because of their light weight they move around more than their thicker ancestors."
3,Good for the price,"I got these for a new Honda Fit because I did not want to plunk down the money for dealer provided mats.They are not a great fit on the driver's side and they do slide a bit, but they get the job done and don't look too bad.They are pretty thin and with only a half year of driving, I'm already noticing a fair amount of wear under my right heel where I use the gas pedal, so I don't now if they'll last, but the price is hard to beat."
5,Impressive,Impressive quality for the price. Much better than going to the local auto parts store and paying 3x more for junk ones.
4,Good value.,"Effective and cheap mats. They do tend to drift around a little, but overall it seems to be a good value."
3,Excellent price,The passenger footwell on my truck is an unusual shape. Custom mats are very expensive so I decided to get these. The fit is far from perfect but they do the job they are intended to do. I would recommend them based on price alone.
4,Universal is spot on.,"i cannot hate on these mats, they were cheap and do what they are meant to do. The only thing i do not like is that i ASSUMED that they would fit to the corners and edges of my cars floor because i did the whole (will this product fit your car) thing and it came up as that it would. Not to be corrected, they definetely ""fit"" the rear is too small and the front are too big. they dont really curve around the foot rest for the driver side. all in all. good product, just know that if u want a nice fit pull out your scissors."
3,Standard Mats,"For the price, you get a decent set of mats. The grippers are a bit small and the mats take some work to get positioned properly. I expect to get only 3 years out of these mats as they are somewhat thin. They do exactly what they are designed to do and that's what matters."
4,car floor mats,these mats are ok for the money----good for a second car--you might want to get better for your main car you drive everyday
3,Great for price,"Bought these for a used car that I got, they are a little cheaper then I expected but they are great for the price!"
1,Just Horrible!!!,This is the baldest Barbie I have brought. Quality is very poor. Lol... My daughter (5) was crying because the doll's hair is so thin and when you comb it the hair just comes out.
1,not what was advertised,"Received this phone and it was not a caller id phone, just a regular trimline phone."
4,"Interesting Review of the Greek, less so for the Roman","Lendon does a credible job of describing and explaining Greek cultural norms and how it affected warfare. I think its effectiveness Lendon's ability to correlate the Homeric epics and with Greek warfare. Since the relationship between the Greeks and their epic is clear, the thesis, I think, holds well.I think that the application of this approach in the Roman era (cultural norms affecting warfare) is less profound. In Greece, the epics actually affected an army's structure and tactics. With Rome, it is more about how the army operated and conducted itself in warfare and the balance between discipline and virtue - less an explaination and more a description.Five stars for the Greek section, three for the Roman, averaging a solid four."
5,My morning tea,"I was recommended to use twig tea to support the acid-alkaline balance in the body. But this tea made its way from the ""have-to"" to ""love-it"" category. I feel especially good when I brew it in the morning and early afternoon - get so much energy from it (also works pretty well before going to the gym).It is very convenient to receive it through mail from amazon - I never run out of it and no need to include it into the shopping list."
4,"Good, but it could have been better","Eclipse: Building Commercial-Quality Plug-ins (2nd Edition) (The Eclipse Series)+ Provides a good overall picture of plug-ins structure, a lot of details.- Contains a lot of methods description that you can find it otherwise in Javadoc, running an eclipse plug-in could have included some more options (in fact for developing I preferred the version from Eclipse help)"
4,Another Great Collection,"This CD continues the tradition of great OBG albums. If anything, the tracks are even better than normal - ""The Letter"", ""Our Day Will Come"", ""One Fine Day"", ""Rescue Me"" and ""Since I Fell For You"" are all fantastic, and most of the rest are maybe half a step behind. As usual, the inclusion of a few 70's tracks makes for some odd listening, but the two selections (""La La Means I Love You"" and ""Reunited"") aren't that bad. A great collection to start out with."
5,"Awesome bass, and a beauty too","I bought this sub for my husband, because I was sick and tired of the huge black box that sat next to our couch. It was an eyesore. I own some of the Cambridge computer speakers and was really impressed with their sound for the money, so I gave this a try. Now we both have what we want. My husband gets a great sounding subwoofer that shakes our walls during fly by scenes of Top Gun, and I get a good looking sub that doesn't make our living room look like am electronics yard sale. My husband especially loves the remote on the subwoofer. Great idea- and adds a cool factor that he shows off to his buddies."
2,It's Made in Mexico!!!,"I want you to notice you that the pencils are made in Mexico. There is no extra bonus in the tin box. I never use the pencils made in USA, so I have no idea whether their quality has gone down. The things I am sure that the product is not made in USA. Amazon doesn't sell things exactly the same as its website said!! I feel really bad about it!"
5,WONDERFUL pencils :),"I absolutely love these pencils. They feel like pastels when I draw with them and they blend almost as well as paint. The colors are bold and rich. The pencils have a wonderful selection of colors. I was also extremely pleased with the seller- the price was far cheaper than anywhere else, and my pencils arrived the very next day after I ordered them."
5,Made a great gift!,Our 16-year-old daughter received these as a gift. She has been drawing every day since then. She loves the vibrancy of the colors and the quality of the pencils.
2,Pretty Boring Book,"The book ""A Year Down Yonder"" was not so good. It told the story of 15 year old Mary Alice who has to leave Chicago to live with Grandma Dowdel in a small town along some train tracks. It has some good parts (like the end) but most of it is boring. I don't recommend this book to anyone because I think there are better books to read."
3,A Year Down Yonder,In A Year Down Yonder a teenager named Mary Alice moves to the country from Chicago. She has to live with her Grandma who is known to like to use guns. At first when she goes to school she has to sit with a girl named Mildred who thinks Mary Alice owes her a buck. Then a girl named Ina-Rae says Mildred is a bully who stole her lunch. A while later a boy named Royce McNabb moves to town. There is one particularly mean girl name Colleen. Also a painter named Arnold moves into Grandma's house. One funny occasion is when Royce comes over to teach Mary Alice math and a woman runs out naked chased by a snake. Arnold says she was posing for a picture. In a christmas paegent instead of a doll for Jesus there was a real baby. It turned out to be Mildred's sister and that is one of the reasons she wasn't at school after the first day. I thought this book was okay.
4,Tyes Review,"My story was about a girl that lived in the big city,and evry year he and her brother had to go to there grandmas house, but this year her brother had to work so she had to go alone and she was sad and didnt want to go with out her brother but her mom made her. She had to ride on a train to get there and when she got there she had to go to school. After a while she had a christmas program and nobody could sing, but the pulled it off. This book was an ok book it was kinda of slow and boring but i got through it."
3,A Mom's Review: White Trash Marilla Cuthbert,"Marilla Cuthbert is one of literature's most memorable characters. Seldom speaking, seldom smiling, seldom approachable. Anne Shirley's experiences with Marilla, especially in the first ""Green Gables"" books, are a mixture of fear, awe, and hope.Richard Peck has captured that element in ""A Year Down Yonder,"" turning Granny Dowdel into a pecan-poaching, DAR-thwarting, cynical redneck Marilla.The book has very funny, memorable moments. It's entertaining, but not worthwhile reading."
4,Favorite pencil,"Started back to school again this semester and decided to stock up on pencils. This particular pencil has been my favorite for years. I've bought more expensive (refillable) pencils but did not like them as much.I have carpal tunnel syndrome so after a lot of writing my hand starts to cramp up. I guess these fit my hands better and unless I'm writing for hours I have no problems with them.Also, I wanted to note that even though I've used other pencils with 0.7mm lead these seem to be sturdier and do not break as often.I did get one bad pencil out of the bunch. The lead would not stay in the pencil no matter what I did. Then without warning the whole thing fell out. But, that is only one out of close to 30 pencils so I won't complain."
2,It's OK,The smell of the candle itself is fantastic however it is not a strong smell. We had ours lit for 3 hours and could barley smell anything.
4,cartoonish but stylish,"Ultra-violent and cartoonish, this is an hommage to some of Tarantino's favorite cult films and directors. Uma Thurman slices and dices her way through tons of bad guys with her trusty Japanese sword, deftly defying gravity to her advantage. At times, this seems like ""Crouching Tiger"" for the MTV generation. The violence is so over the top that it really is funny, especially when limbs and heads get severed and there's geyers of blood spurting forth.Part of the film is animie that explains the origin of the Lucy Liu character. It is highly stylized in its own right and commands your complete attention.Some of the non-action scenes are too long and drawn out, which is this film's biggest flaw.If you're looking for complex plot and thought-provoking dialogue, look elsewhere. If you're looking for mindless action, this is about as stylized and as funny as it gets. Blows away films that take themself too seriously, like the Blade series. Look for part II next year."
2,Brain Dead Cinema,"I think that this movie was poorly put together. It seems that those who think it is the greatest movie ever are more concerned with praising the director because of his past works. My main problem with this film is the swords. What is the purpose? It is not like she and her family were attacked with swords.. they were gunned down but suddenly she picks up a sword, which she has no skill with by the way. The worst scene in this movie is when the bride fights Yakuza and they all have swords and one fights with a ball and chain. I mean really...don't gangsters carry guns? Its set in the 21st century for crying out loud. The plot is horrible, the time frame is wrong and I could understand if it was a comedy..but anything else no. Show yourself some respect and save your money..rent it at best I gave it 2 stars because of its attempt at something unique and at times it was amusing.Uma Thurman : tricks are for-Lucy Lu : - kidswhat the ????????"
1,Are you a Tarantino Fan?,"I can't add anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep this very short and sweet. I avoided watching this movie, because I'm not a Tarantino fan. However, I caved in and watched Vol 1, and (inexplicably) the first 1/3rd of Vol 2.If you aren't a Tarantino fan, you're not going to like these, plain and simple. There isn't some drastically new ground that's going to make you suddenly say, ""OH! Quentin Tarantino, now I like him!""Uma looks gorgeous, and all the ladies are in fantastic shape. It's a comic book of spraying blood, jerky plot progression, and great looking ladies. However, it's Tarantino through and through. I would have survived without. If you're a QT fan, it'll be worth all the stars most other people give it."
1,Don't Waste Money on Domestc Version,"I am giving the movie only 1 star because of the domestic DVD version of this film. BEWARE!! The movie itself is an awesome film. However, the Japanese release and DVD contain far more detail. Not only is the Japanese version 3 minutes longer, but the Yakuza fight scene is filmed entirely in COLOR. Furthermoe, the Japanese version contains the graphic trunk dismemberment scene of Uma cutting off the other arm of the assistant. The Japanese DVD contains all the same features, and much more! Don't be fooled by the domestic release!"
2,What was Tarantino thinking?,"What was Tarantino thinking? He stuffs all his favorite genres into a single movie mixing visuals, music, and styles from scene to scene. A washed out scene like a spaghetti western including the ripped off soundtrack. A campy chopsuey bloody fight scene. A stylish martial arts scene. Japanese anime - yes, Tarantino tosses in animation scenes. Film noir. A dash of campy Charlie's Angels. I'm sure I'm missing some. Add in a near record number of annoying flashbacks and you have a confused film one assumes is meant to be, at some level, satire but lacks any real humor, cleverness, or bite. Terribly sadistic in places, it generally is lacking in humanity. Uma Thurman is completely wasted though she tries awfully hard to breath life into an empty script. Oh, did I mention his fascination with spraying blood that gushes from wounds like an uncapped fire hydrant? Excessive is what this film's all about. This movies is only for Tarantino fans."
5,i loved it,Quentiin Tarantino is fantastic as a director. When searching through the features i found out it was missing his commentarywhich i wanted to hear but the movie was awesome and the making of featurette was cool. i strongly reccomend this movie.
2,Not for me,"The acting is good, but the plot is weak. As a writer, I prefer a movie with a stronger plotline and character development. However, if you're big on action, you may like it."
2,Hard to Kill Bill,"It is never a good sign when the first Quentin Tarrantino film in years borrows its basic plot from a Steven Seagal movie. At least in Hard to Kill, when Seagal emerges from his coma, he has to train to get back into peak condition. Whereas in Kill Bill, all that has to be done to get back into shape after being in a coma for 4 years is the old ""wiggle your big toe"" work out.I guess this is Quentin's homage to old school Kung Fu movies... I feel like he borrowed a little too heavily. Right down to the team of assassins, which may be ""inspired"" by the Five Deadly Venoms.Of course, it's hard to give this film a fair review, since the movie theater asked us to leave after the first half. They told us we could come back in February to see the rest, but we'll have to pay again. That seems fair."
5,Uma me,"This is ok for a b-movie.Half-a-movie at full-price -- it's annoyingly unsatisfying. Also self-indulgent, sadistic, juvenile, pretty to look at, and empty as a beer can on my front porch. Its ok to rent and spank to this movie, but if your looking for a keeper, check into Vivid's line of movies starring Jenna Jameson, Celeste, and Chasey Lain, and Debbie Diamond.Your little guy will thank you"
4,Excellent Tarantino Film,"Those who like Quentin Tarantino films won't be disappointed. Kill Bill certainly has his quirky style. Action enthusiast will also enjoy Kill Bill. Some of the decapitation scenes were a bit much, but give Tarantino credit for showing us something different...I can't recall ever seeing so much blood spraying around! I can't wait to see Kill Bill Volume 2."
5,Fasten your jump suits...,"...it's going to be a bumpy fight! A film that is a high octane, ass kicking, gut wrenching, camp, cute, American/Eastern fusion of glamourous ass whoopings and revenge slaughters. Faint heart never won Fair Lady but Fair Lady rocks here with a blisteringly bitter dialogue and a heart full of hate for her near killers and the killers of her unborn child.Thurman is raw, upfront and utterly brilliant and the style of the movie is weirdly campsy, cutsey, retro with a big sting in the tale. Totally typical, highly original, blood spattered Tarantino, humour/drama.Should have been showered in Oscars from a severed artery of Osacar production in downtown Tokyo!"
2,"Why the B&W? Read on, MacDuff....","Why watch a film that pulls it's punches at the climatic fight scene in order to secure an R rating when you can watch the unrated Ichi The Killer? This will neither please the Extreme Asian crowd nor the Tarantino fanbase who have seen him do all this better before. Likewise, the Sergio Leone/Morricone animated pastiche is accurate but so what? The Ironside music was particularly embarrassing. Be honest, is this any different to the latest Charlie's Angels movie?"
2,Tarantino has lost his touch,"I thought Pulp Fiction was the best film of the 90s, which pains me to say, because the decade contains Goodfellas and Martin Scorcese is my favorite director. When you consider PF along with Reservoir Dogs and the True Romance screenplay, Tarantino emerges as one of the singular voices of the past 35 years. But it seems he has lost it. Yes, there are flashes of brilliance here (Uma's initial meeting with fighting master Pei Mei is mesmerizingly cool and surreal). However, it seems as if more than 50% of this film is spent in having to listen to David Carradine's Bill ramble on about the film's backstory. It's a film Quentin, not a novel."
5,IT DOESNT GET BETTER,Two of my favs in KILL BILL 1 AND 2 made great on blue ray with better music and graphics.. Tarentino at his best.. with all the cast being spot on..
1,Absolute Crap,"Lets see,how can we glorify the severing of limbs,heads,and yes,lets use a garden hose with a sprayer set to wide to show the blood gushing from the above mentioned body parts.What a waste!!!!!!!"
1,Pretentious and pathetic,"Trash is too good a word for this film. A bad copy of some bad Japanese Ronin film, an insult to Samurai, a slap in the face to any Japanese film buff.Call this a very bad spaghetti samurai film.The dialogue was horrible, especially when Uma Thurman is trying to acquire a sword from a Japanese cafe owner. Baaaad!!!!!Gee! This film sucked!!!"
3,"Wanted to like it more, 3 1/2 star movie at best","Big fan of all of Quentins films, this is my 2nd least favourite, with volume 2 being my least. Still his worst films are still much much better than most of the tripe out there. Maybe because I could see where he stole so mucg of the stuff from, or maybe I just prefer real world settings for films. I loved parts of it and I loved the soundtrack. I think there could've been more blood. I'd read so much, I was really expecting them to go to town."
3,How he will be remembered...,"On The Waterfront. The Grapes of Wrath. The Exorcist. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. Goodfellas. Pulp Fiction.Those are movies that will not soon nor never, be forgotten. This one will. It is already being played on craptv. Please, if you're a fan of this movie and the sequel, see this man's other films. They are better. But yay for Quentin. He got all the nerds into him."
5,Love this movie,"We love this movie and have been looking for it everywhere. We found the second Kill Bill but never the first. Finally found it on Amazon, of course, and ordered it right away. It was received in great condition, brand new, and was rec'd very quickly. Thanks again Amazon!!"
2,What is this mess!,"I like movies such as blade and Crouching tiger... and others, but this is out there. For the record this is one of the most ultra violent, bloody,and revengeful movies that I have ever seen. It is Samurai Jack meets Charles Angel and Blade. The blood makes Jason, Halloween, Jeepers Creepers, and Aliens look tame by comparison. This movie is a super ultra-bloody, and violent. This is no way a compliment. Although the fight scene are unbelievably cool and good, I hope no one is stupid enough to let their children watch this mess. This film could have been better. The guts coming out is over the top. I got the point that the guy had to die."
3,KILL BILL VOL 1,Conditions of product were excellent and the delivery process very rapid. Would do business again.
3,Modern Tarantino,If you don't like Quentin Tarantino films you might as well just move on now. This is a modern day movie with old school martial arts. The action shots were well done. You might get a little lost with the time warps but as I said if you don't like Tarantino Films just move on.
1,sucks!,"Ugh, this is one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through. Watching this rancid exercise in self~indulgence is like being trapped in a car on a long road trip with a boring film nerd who just won't shut up. I have been told that a lot of this tripe is ""intentionally bad"", which is apparently a good thing, but nevertheless intentionally bad is still bad. It's evidently based on all the B movies Tarantino has seen, so I guess it's trash stealing from trash. Avoid unless you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone else play video games.Ivan Rorick"
1,Sick,"I saw a few parts of this movie and had to stop. This movie was totally sick and twisted. It was total insult to one's intelligence. Save you time and money and don't watch this movie. If it were possible to give this movie less than one star, I wouldn't hesitate to do so."
1,Over rated,"It was good, to an extent but it was too preditable. Granted the fight scenes were ok but it seemed as though they were redundant and for that matter it felt like it took a while to kill anyone. I thought i was in a bad mood when i saw it the first time, so i watched it again and realized how bad it is. Maybe the second one will redeem it but as for right now i didnt like it at all."
2,Had potential,"KILL BILL has a weak storyline, and next to nothing character development. That in itself is enough to make you steer clear of this film. KILL BILL relies on violence and unusual killings to try and pull you in. The only saving grace of the film is the interesting camera work, but I very much doubt that this film will become a cult classic like earlier films from Quentin Tarantino.The very best part of the film was when it ended. Let's just hope that Volume 2 never sees the light of day."
1,HORRIBLE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This film was so bad that after 5 minutes, even the guys in our group were groaning. We all voted to immediately turn it off and watch something else.A violent version of ""Dumb and Dumber and Dumbest (the director)""."
3,I watched the DVD today and it was...,"OK but not as impressive as the viewers claim. The actors don't even know how to hold a sword properly (not to mention posture) and that's a shame because even I can wield a sword much better than any of them. (I've been practicing Kendo for ""only"" 3 months.) What a shame that this is all they can do after rigorous training. Also the story didn't flow well due to bad editing. This film is all about watching cool stuff and nothing else. I'm aware that this is a post-modern film, exploiting some elements from films made in the past, but this film is not a good movie.P.S. France=England?? You all know that's not true. Then why China (Hong Kong)=Japan?? Tarantino doesn't certainly understand a thing about the differences between two."
2,silly,"Quentin is a self-proclaimed master of dialogue. not with this one. every time someone opens their mouth, they say something overly-dramatic. (the best [or worst] example of this would be when that japaneese girl with the ball and chain is talking to that guy in the bar. ""is it you that has penetrated me, or i that has penetrated you""? or something very similar. that was something that made me dumber just hearing it) dialogue aside, quentin tried to make a good action movie (i think). he didnt do a great job at this either. the gore would be laughable if they tried to be campy about it, but its just lame. cottonmouth cut that one guys head off, and waited at *least* four seconds for the blood to shoot onto the celing. and when black mamba is fighting those japaneese gang members, she cuts their chests and blood shoots about twelve feet in the air. i DID think the knife fight was cool, and thats the only reason im not giving this movie a one."
3,Rambo in a modern female version,"Thats what this picture is, a modern female Rambo, who kills hundreds of guys only witn a knife. Why the didn't use a fire weapon?"
2,Price point will have to compete against filesharing,"Some people are going to buy a 512MB or 1gig memory stick and download movies thru a p2p. Yes you have to encode the movie to mpeg4, but there are encoders available for free for the psp savvy that will bother to find them and they are not hard to find. In fact this downloadable feature could backfire on the umd. Now I am willing to buy the umds because I'm a collector, a fan of the box art and the entire package. But $13-$15 is about right. $20 and up is out of the question considering the unit's main function is games. I can't see paying $30 for a disk that is for me, a secondary function. I'm saving that money for the games."
5,GRETEST FILM BY TARANTINO!,"It has the humor...the gore...the strange dialogue...and a great story by tarantino. i rented it and i thought, ""Wow what a story!"" Uma Therman deserves Best Actress at the Academy Awards! The sword fighting scenes are cool and gory as hell! YEA GORY! BLOOD! BLOODD! LIMBS BEING SLICED!!!HEADS CUT!! GUYS BEING BUTCHERED BY UMA IS GREAT!!!!!!! What and ending and i loved it!!!Watch it!!!!! Its worth buying!!!!!"
3,Save your money for the later editions!!!,"Don't get me wrong: I liked the movie a lot. But this is a skimpy DVD and knowing how Miramax works, just the first of several editions. If you hold off buying this one and put the money aside, I'm sure you'll have opportunities to buy Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together for a lower price - or the rumored Kill Bill: Director's Cut that will show it as one 3-hour movie. Those later editions will likely have all the extras - this one doesn't look like it has much. As someone who's been burned by Miramax's DVD practices before, I just want to offer you a warning. Be patient - and you'll be rewarded later."
4,Tarantino's style,"Amidst the mindless violence that is captured in this film there is a subtle and elegant beauty between the storyline and the way Tarantino portrays it. Tarantino's style of filming is pushed into full throttle when it comes to kill bill; the sound track is great and merged perfectly from scene to scene. Tarantino did a great job of merging animation into the film and also the cut scenes where it goes black and white. Overall I would say this is a solid film, definitly noteworthy for the way it brings Kung fu movies to the 21st century"
5,Killer,"Tarantino is like fine wine...he gets better with age. He is the coolest, hippest, most complete film director of the last 50 years. This film rocks out."
5,Awesome!!!,"Quentin proves his genius in film writing and direction once again...Very violent - but for those who know ahead of time what type of film this is, it's pure enjoyment!!Kill Bill is clearly be one of the years best... May BE the best!!!"
4,This guy needs therapy...,"... but we should le him make some more movies first. I admit anyone who even watches this is probably a little messed up, but oh well. This movie is fantastic, loads of awesome stunts, great action, and interesting plot. Although at times it could be a little boring, or a little too bizarre for me. It was still a wonderful movie! Everyone (provided they're old enough to handle it) should see it! And don't forget volume 2!"
5,"Kill Bill, Volume 1","A fun movie, with lots of action. If you are a fan of these kinds of films, you wont be dissapointed."
2,Not real happy,"I suppose it was my error in judgement but my thinking I was going to get a widescreen presentation of this move. The movie was excellent but it was full screen and I really like lbx movies and have seen this one on tv in lbx and just assumed, which I know you aren't supposed to do, it would be lbx since it was a dvd."
4,Full of great secrets and tips,"This is an excellent set of tapes. They don't teach you how use motion graphic software and are intended for people who are already familiar with the tools. The tapes deal mostly with the Adobe combination of Photoshop, After Effects and Illustrator, but the concepts can be applied to any similar-type programs. And this is what the tapes teach- valuable concepts, not nifty & useless filters, but clever and clearly defined solutions to common and important motion graphic diffuculties.There are sections about field order, alpha channel types and interprations, mixing 3D with 2D and how best to render. Most of the informaiton pretains to broadcast diffuculties. There's little filler; the tapes run through a large range of topics at a steady pace. Definately recommended."
2,Poor quality,"A copy of this DVD+R came with my HP external DVD burner. DVD+R's in general are cheaper than their DVD+RW counterpart, and after trying to make a copy of a DVD, I discovered why. The DVD+RW burned with no problem, but the DVD+R disc did not. Maybe I should try more before I judge them, but based off of first impressions, this DISC gets a D- rating from me!"
4,"Seduction, Cowboy Style by Anne Marie Winston","Description from the book back cover:When Silver Jenssen waltzed into town, Deck Stryker was stunned to learn she was his enemy's sister. But he wanted her with unparalleled intensity and so set out to seduce her. He started with mouth-watering caresses ... Silver had vowed never to be swayed by sweet words and promises again. But this man's lean, hard body and seductive persuasion overwhelmed her resolve. She tumbled into his arms ... and then discovered his betrayal. But she knew what could bind them together forever. She carried his child ..."
3,"Very, Very Small bag",I ordered this bag and I was so disappointed. If you can get a cell phone and the keys to the car in this bag - then consider yourself lucky. I returned the bag. Nice summer colors - but really small
5,Love the Extended Remixes!,Perfect collection for Prince fans! All my favorite Prince songs in one collection! Love the extended remixes! Very excited to have this in my collection! Thank you!
2,Clumsy anthology,"Presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best:Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. (""My Name is Prince""? His take on ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2 compiles 12"" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness ever records.BOTTOM LINE:This is haphazardly thrown together. Middle range fans are better off withThe Hits/The B-Sideswhich compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles)."
5,Ultimate Prince,"Although this is clearly not the ""ULTIMATE"" for Prince, this is a pretty good collection of extended versions of my favorites:1. I Wanna Be Your Lover [Single Version2. Uptown [Single Version]3. Controversy4. 1999 [Edit]5. Delirious [Edit]6. When Doves Cry [Edit LP Version]7. I Would Die 4 U8. Purple Rain9. Sign 'O' The Times [Single Version]10. I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man11. Alphabet St.12. Diamonds And Pearls [Edit]13. Gett Off14. Money Don't Matter 2 Night15. 716. Nothing Compares 2 U17. My Name Is Prince [Single Version]18. Let's Go Crazy [Special Dance Mix]19. Little Red Corvette [Dance Mix]20. Let's Work [Dance Remix]21. Pop Life [Fresh Dance Mix]22. She's Always In My Hair [12"" Version]23. Raspberry Beret [Extended 12"" Version]24. Kiss [Extended Version]25. U Got The Look [Long Look]26. Hot Thing [Extended Remix]27. Thieves In The Temple [Remix Version]28. Cream [N.P.G. Mix]For the price it was well worth it.Prince fans enjoy....."
4,"Nice collection, but not as good as it could be.","I was really dissapointed that all of the songs I love are mediocre extended versions and ""Cream"" is a really crappy remixed version. I like the original version of all the songs better. They really should have just put the original tracks on this collection. It would have gotten 5 stars from me. I had to deduct 1 star because of the lack of the original ""Creme"" and unnecessary extended versions of his songs that I don't care for."
4,the word is 'mellow',"A new record label, a new direction for the Stranglers. ""Feline"" is a much more laid-back album than anything before (or since, for that matter), and as such it stands out with ""The Meninblack"" as sonically the most distinctive. Here, the bass is less grumbly, the guitar is mostly acoustic, and Dave Greenfield's fairground organ has been replaced with a synth sound perhaps more typical of other bands of the time. It's a combination that allows the songs more time to breathe; only the fluttery ""Let's Tango in Paris"", a sort of electronic reprise of ""Golden Brown"" comes in well below four minutes. Overall, this is a much more polished sound than before. Fans of the earlier Stranglers may well say it's dull, but I think mellower is a better term."
3,"OK, but not perfect","I am somewhat dissapointed in this device; but I've not found an oven thermometer anywhere that is 1) easy to read IN the oven, 2) able to remain clean for a long time, and 3) easy to attach or balance on the oven racks. This one has very good accuracy and a large dial, but it will NOT remain where I put it in the oven. The darn thing makes me get down on hands and knees to read it, all the while letting the heat escape from the oven. Save yourself a lot of grief and spring for the exterior thermometer type with the internal probe."
1,Brand name and price isn't always a good indicator of the product,"Taylor is well known for quality oven thermometers. I purchased this one based on their name and it was their higher priced unit. The ""Connoisseur"" in the brand name also swayed me to make the purchase.Although the bracket/stand the thermometer is supposed to be attached with provides for various ways of putting it in the oven... none of them work well at all. If it is clipped to a rack it can't be read. Hang it sideways... can't read it. Hang it facing the door... you can't read it. Lay it on the bottom rack (which I ended up doing) and it's readable but very difficult to read. And, it just gets worse over time as the lens tends to get coated and turns brown.I just ordered the Cuisinart brand of oven thermometer to try instead. It looks like it has an easier to read dial with better color coding."
4,proved me right... and wrong,"I bought this because I had a sneaky suspicion my oven wasn't working the way it should. Sure enough, it beeps to say it's preheated to 350, but it's really still at 250. And all this time I just thought my oven preheated super fast! So, that said, after waiting for a while, I see that my oven really is calibrated just fine (after a while, the temp rises to 350 and stays steady at that temperature). So, I just need to wait before I put stuff in the oven. I would never have known this without this nifty thermometer!My only problem is that I have yet to figure out a way to put the thermometer in there and keep it out of the way and yet still be able to read the face. I think I just need to keep playing with this to find something that works for me. I cook daily and often use both racks, so I am probably in a different place than most people."
1,Impossible to attach to rack,"It may or may not be accurate, but I can't attach it to my over rack because the clip is too wide. I would have to do it sideways, which means I would have to open the oven and let out all of the hot air."
1,It's ok...,"If you are used to American movies, don't be upset with this one. It's a different kind of movie from a culture very different from the one westerners are used to. A lot of this movie was just watching these women, and seeing their sad lives intermingle. If you want to see a good Iranian film, try The Hidden Half or Leila. They were much more interesting."
2,surprising,"Say what you want about the regime in Tehran being a bunch of barbaric nincompoops, but they sometimes give the green light to films that make them look like the repressive idiots they are. This film is a good example.What I mean is that I was struck by the film's suggestion that the woes of women in Iran do not arise out of Islamic teachings or foreign influence, but rather the strictures of Tehran itself. But aren't those the same misogynistic louts who allowed this film to be made?"
3,Pathetic & Miserable. But Changes are on the way!,"Think about the womenfolks in the Middle East and think about us. How lucky we are. Iran is a beautiful country full of wonderful country people. The people in that City are always cold and defensive like any other city in the world. Iran, the islamic fanatics hold hostage of the American Embassy not too long ago, now, women folks could vote, although not to many choices for the candidates, but at least it's a start. Democracy would not and could not be reached and accomplished so quickly, but it's a start. Please get the new movie ""Secret Ballots"" to get a newer version of this. You have to get the real meaning of the word, CIRCLE, to understand the real meaning of Islamic male and female way of thinking, since their lives, especial the female ones, are always a tight circle, getting out is always difficult.For the movie itself, it's an okay movie, watchable but not great enough to give high praises."
2,a coloring book???,"this book needs a hardback counterpart, it seems like a coloring book...with it's b&w pages and pictures...the info is great but keep an eye out for the enclyclopedia update"
5,Bowen's Chritmas '08,I received the item in a timely manner. It was a Christmas gift for my great-nephew and I didn't personally read or watch it.
5,Nice Calm Entertainment,"My five year old son loves this movie! I really like that he is amused by such a calm soothing film. Most of the kids movies tend to hype the kids up, this one has the opposite effect, maybe its the music."
1,Wow - what an awful movie.,"It's hard to say what is the worst part of this movie. Maybe it is the fact that instead of Piglet being the focus of the movie, it is actually Rabbit (the least likeable character in the Pooh series) who dominates the entire show. We are treated (or should I say mistreated) to Rabbit's perpetual complaints and negative attitude, and to a offensive skit involving Rabbit's scheme to rid the forest of Kanga & Roo. Perhaps it is the terrible soundtrack. Don't get me wrong - I like Carly Simon, but these songs are so mindless and chirpy, it is just painful to listen to. Either way, this movie a bust from start to finish."
3,Warning to Non-Baby Boomers,"My two-year old son loves this movie! Unfortunately for me, the horrifically shrill sounds of Carly Simon warbling away on the soundtrack are enough to make me want to slit my wrists. Warning to any parent who is not an aging baby-boomer, who put off having kids until you were ""ready"". DO NOT BUY this movie. Your young children will love it, however, unless you have a cache of earplugs or a vault you can lock yourself in while your child watches it, you will develop irritable bowel syndrome, an aneurysm or possibly lapse into a coma. Do yourself a favor and just take Junior to the park instead."
4,Great Economical Eyepiece,"This eyepiece came with my Apex 127 Makustov-Cassegrain telescope. It showed excellent views of the Orion Nebula, Jupiter's cloud bands, and the craters on the moon. All at 61x! You definately can't ger a better eyepiece for the money! The only reason this lost a star is because of the lack of a captive setscrew recess to keep the eyepiece from falling out, should the should the knob come loose."
1,Why bother?,"I gave my phsyics teacher money for this book becuase i was forced into buying it. Very confusing but it explains what i need to know, i think. What is the point? How will i know if i am right or wrong and if i understand the book unless i have answers? Who would sell a math book without answers? I hear they have an answer book so i went to ask my physics teacher if i could buy it. He laughed and said it is only available for teachers. Well then why doesnt my teacher explain the answers or hand them out. I am also concerned that Prentice hall should distrubiute or sell the answer book to everyone."
2,negative,purchased the raspberry fruit rolls 3 times. the last 2 times (5 months apart) the raspberry rolls were hard as rocks and had a perfume taste to them. All the other flavors were great.
5,A principle entry point for intuitive understanding of topology,Causal physics and transfinite arithmetics have their basis in alegbraic topology where behavior is described by a catagorization of geometric types and associated algebraic germs interacting to cause a behvioral system. The four books by Abraham are the best entry point for a reader's entry into a deep and intuitive understanding of the systematic description of behavior and its evolution.
3,"Too much filler, not enough Killer","This is the Irish REM/Jimmyeatworld alikes second album and while it has some great poppy moments it just isn't consistent enough. This band will always write a great chorus and after the first two songs you think you're in for a great ride. However its all a bit downhill and the only other songs on the album I dont find myself skipping eventually is the title track and the last song. 'Understand' is undoubtedly a classic pop song with delightful Jimmy eat world harmonies and a punchy vocalist Cormac Battle who sounds so much like Michael Stipe it has to be heard to be believed. Overall, if you like bouncy, fun pop music this may well be for you. But, if you're into something more complexed, like me, this may be not quite your cup of tea."
2,disappointed,"Actually, I have to say this is not something worth buying, even if you are a die-hard fan, which I can say without any doubt in my mind, I am. proof? i have drumsticks and picks from countless shows, shirts, cds, posters etc signed by all the ladies, and of course every ladies room cd and ep/demo/yellow tape/itunes recording they have ever put out... and i was truly dissapointed by this DVD, it is advertized as a live show with interviews, and that part is fine, but the only extra feature is you get to watch the interview uncut... no 'maroon foot cream' or DVD-rom features. if you know someone that has it, watch it so that you can say you have seen it. But I wouldn't recomend spending more than five dollars on this BNL item."
3,A Must For Die-Hard BNL Fans,"There's 2 parts: The main video: interview sections & clips from various shows, and the studio interview on it's own. It's very informative, but redundant if you've read the biography by Paul Meyers. In fact, the book goes into more detail about each member & how they join the band.I enjoyed this DVD, I love the band, I just wish it showed more of their live stuff from early in their career. Best to grab it on netflix unless you're a hardcore BNL fan/collector."
3,A classical novel in a Canadian setting,"The Fifth Business describes the life and feelings of Dunstan Ramsey, a schoolmaster and a religious writer whose aim in life is to explore its limits and live a moral life. His friendship with Boy Stauton - a successful businessman, socialite and an amateur politician - presents moral dilemas and opportunities for personal advancement. His association with Paul Dempster, an accomplished magician whose career Dunstan launched, introduces and pursues an element of mystery and deeper meanings in life. Fifth Business is highly readable and presents a broad panorama of life over the span of one's life, in the tradition of European novels such as those written by Thomas Mann or Hermann Hesse. In its broad scope the novel treats its characters as stylized creations that - by design - lack the intensity and vulnerability that one expects from a true-to-life piece of fiction."
4,wonderful tale of growth,"This trilogy allows the reader to enter a fascinating world of personal pathologies, individual growth, and faith. While each charcter is limited in their own way, they come together late in life and make surprizing discoveries about themselves and about love. It is a peculiar mix of cynicism and a sincere tract in favor of psyhotherapy, with one of the best descriptions of a Jungian analysis available in fiction. But you also see the world of staged magic, grammar schools, and provincial Canada. Highly recommended, if a somewhat quirky world with unusual characters. And beautifully written."
3,"some great Motown stuff, some of it very average",Good stuff and some very average stuff. Detroit always has produced great sounds. Better to download favorites and not have the other stuff around.
3,"a decent effort, but nothing amazing","This is probably the weakest album for this great band. I suspect that only hardcore cobra fans are going to enjoy this one. Pass on this one, see them live and grab Mink,Rabbit or Rat and enjoy!!"
5,The Elephant In MY Tree,"I am a PreSchool teacher, and my children love this story. It is definately meant to be read out loud. It has alot of repetition, and many of the kids can ""read"" it on their own after hearing it just a few times. This is one of those books that will get worn and tattered in a classroom because it get's looked at every day by several of the students!"
1,Buy something else!,"Absolute junk. Hasn't sharpened properly since day one. Rough surface left on wood, uneven point and broken tips, plastic size guide won't stay in one place and the shaving catcher won't stay attached.Other than that a fine piece of engineering."
5,Prismacolor Pencils,"Purchased as a gift for a fellow artist, these art pencils are professional quality and this set of 24 for $16.50 is a good buy. I use them too and can vouch for their consistent, creamy color and even hardness throughout each pencil. As a pastelist, I appreciate the softness of these pencils and how blendable and rich the colors are without sacrificing the clean edge of a pencil mark. Highly recommended."
5,Subwoofer with style,"Most subwoofers I've heard just thud along. The Cambridge P500 is really musical, with a clarity I normally don't hear from a woofer. It's small. It looks very cool. And I love the remote control. I don't have to crawl around on all fours to change the bass level. I prefer it to several [more expensive] subwoofers I listened to."
5,Alan Ladd I love you!,"This is my second Alan Ladd movie(I just saw Shane). My goodness he was cute! And very good in the bad-guy-you-feel-sorry-for role. It's a sad movie, though, and the death scene is very good- genuinely sad without being overdone. And yes, Veronica Lake is fabulous."
2,Not as good as the other Ladd/Lake film noir features,"This movie starts out good, but the plot gets chaotic and boring. Veronica Lake is the only real attraction for this movie. The Glass Key and The Blue Dahlia are much better for this genre. Some scenes with Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd used in LA Confidential."
2,Over-rated....Lake and Ladd make up for a tired scenario,"This is the movie that made Alan Ladd a star, and his teaming here with Veronica Lake caused quite a stir back in 1942.Sadly, THIS GUN FOR HIRE is really second-rate noir, a tired melodrama that really doesn't hold up, especially for repeat viewings.Universal's DVD looks very similar to the old Image laserdisc release from a few years back. Not really any improvementThere's a lot of film-noir available on DVD, but this one doesn't live up to the hype. Skip it."
4,Decent but unmemorable noir,"The Bottom Line:Veronica Lake is quite fetching and she and Alan Ladd make a good couple together, but nothing in this film really grabbed me and stayed with me after my viewing: if you want an effective and brief (80 minutes) piece of cinema you'll do fine with This Gun for Hire, but it's really quite forgettable.3/4"
1,Naked vs Naturism,"Too bad I didn't read the other reviews before buying this. It doesn't really say much about naturism, but is supposed to be about one guy's attempt to make a naturist movie, interviews with potential actors, etc. It's very disconnected, and the copy I got kept repeating after scene 11, even though there was a scene 12. Bad value, in my opinion."
1,"Very misleading, didn't like it","This is supposed to be about true nudism. However it's just a bunch of paid actors with a HORRIBLE script. About 1/10 of the movie actually gets into the history of nudism, and interviews the owner of a nudist resort, but that's about it. Everything else if not at all about nudism. If you just want to see a couple of naked people, then go ahead and get this, but if you're actually interested in something that's truly about nudism/naturism, then don't bother with this."
4,Cooler than expected,"This was somewhat of an impulse buy for me, but I was surprised by some of the candid moments in this, some of which were pretty humorous. Also, some of the aspiring actresses, as well as hostess Christine Nguyen, are quite easy on the eyes, especially naked! Recommended."
1,dissapointed,"This product was a one time watch, I was hoping for beach bunnies and some women who peeked my intrest. what ever their idea for thiis fim was I did not watch it twice."
4,I'm a million miles high I'm a piece of the sky!,"It is appropriate that ""Free"" the always missing title track finally make it's mark on this seminal album. This was the cd that cemented my love for this amazing and always re-inventive band. ""Little Wing"" is appropriate as well as a lot of this record is very much influenced by Hendrix era blues/rock. Crunchy, melodic, and sometimes funny. Napolitano, Rushakoff, and Mankey make it brilliant. Hooks abound and Johnette's amazingly powerful voice...Do not overlook this gem from 1989."
5,Great price and clean cd....,I lost my og cd in a divorce. So glad I found this and love it always. It came at a good price too.
3,They are Tweeters,It's okay to replace two speakers with these cheap lil guys if you're lacking some high end. You'll still need some decent speakers in addition since these produce zero bass and very little mid range.
3,tweeter,as one of the comments stated before me these are basicly great for high notes. i run a sub so i dont mind them but if your not running a sub the music wouldnt sound great. there cheep and a good idea if your selling a car and want the speakers you put in.
3,Fencing The Sky,"I thought this was a non-fiction book and it may be based on real life but, with only about 1/4 of it read, it seems a little slow. For someone wanting just a good story, it would probably be good."
2,ink,"I use this ink for my everyday printing needs. Allthough the price is high, I cannot complain. I would recommend this ink to others."
1,No go,Didn't work for me.Don't know why not. So had to return it. Had work to do so went to my back up printer and have been using that.
4,A Dream of a Lifetime,"Heather and Frederick make their trip so real, you really would like to be with them. The idea that a couple can take a year off and travel the world makes other dreams seem possible too. It had to be scarey, exciting and satisfying to do something like this. You have to read it to understand how great it was. I am sure we will hear more from them in the future."
3,I'm glad matt is back with the BJM,"Now I'm a considerable Brian Jonestown Massacre fan and when I heard that Matt Hollywood had anothe rband I was stoked to check it out. So I bought this on amazon and gave it a listen. To start, there are a few interesting songs on this album.It starts with a dub-esque intro to a fairly decent song called ""Little Elf"" and leads into a few pretty decent tunes, but overall this album is nothing special. The production value isn't very high so if you're into more low-fi stuff I guess you'll like it, but the main thing is that the songs themselves aren't all that interesting. Nothing really jumps out at you and grabs your attention. It's really nothing special.If you're into this kind of music I'd recommend sticking with the brian jonestown massacre. Much more interesting group."
3,"Great tunes, meh performance.","If you love the music of F.O.W., you'll enjoy the set list on this performance from the Windy City--good audio, effective camera work, but, boy, do they ever look bored."
4,Great results and long wearing,"The foundation is very smooth and seems to last almost all day for me. Normally, most makeup is gone from my face in a couple of hours or less. I touch my face too much. But this one seems to stay put without feeling like I am wearing a plaster of Paris mask all day. It stays looking fresh significantly longer than I normally expect.I am not entirely sure WHY the spray can. I think the idea is you can try to spray it on so you will have an airbrushed perfect look...but for me I end up with big circles of thick makeup on my face and my hair looks gray from all of the overspray. I spray it onto my finger or a sponge and apply like any other foundation. The bottle seems to last longer when I apply it that way too. Very nice product. Love Dior makeup."
4,Modestly disappointed,"This book is great for beginners (such as me), however, it's lacking a number of songs. Nonetheless, for the price it's really very good."
4,Magnificent Overview,"The contribution of John Maynard Keynes to modern economics is unquestionable. With leading governments across the world still following his advice, it surprised me to find that this was the first book to thoroughly analyze and develop his method of thought from a philosophical point of view.I thought it was a quite brilliant read in almost all aspects. Of course, some chapters were better than others - Sheila Dow's chapter was superb, Rod O'Donnell's didn't match my own thinking, but overall the book is a great introduction to students studying Keynes' thought and an even better read for more mature readers who have perhaps forgotten the importance of the great man!"
5,Touched By a Miracle,Stephen Wagner does a fantastic job recounting a few miracles everday people have encountered. The book brings chills and goosebumps to your spine when you read this. I dare anyone to read this book and not agree that there is another hand working within our lives. The miracles in this book are touching and enlightening. I recommend this book to anyone..especially those of you who need to be uplifted (and often entertained) by these stories.
5,Making a Virtue of Understatement,"This album by Pan-American is a very beautiful, very austere collection of songs. If you like your music stripped down, yet still with enough melodic tooth to keep you subliminally interested you'll surely enjoy this album. Strongly recommended..."
2,Difficult Setup But works OK,"I bought this to listen to books on trips. I found that while the sound quality was good, the set up was not easy. The description sounds pretty simple: ""set the transmitter & a stereo to the same fm frequency"". Problem is there are only 5 or 6 frequencies that it works on. Also, they don't tell you is that in order to set the frequency, you have 3 LITTLE switches on the side. You need the little paper ""manual"" to tell you which switch goes where (up/down) to set it to a specific radio station. Of the frequency choices, there was only 1 that didn't have a station on it. Then as I traveled, I would lose that frequency and have to stop and reprogram the unit.Listening to spoken word the sound is good, I have not used it for music so can't say how the sound quality is.Would I buy it again? Probably not, just because of the hassle of programming it. Was it worth what I paid? I don't think so."
4,Nice item...would buy again.,Bought this for my 16yr old son due to prior reviews. He is very pleased with this. We have used it on a few car trips with no problems. Just had to change radio stations a few times as we traveled. Works well in the house too. I hope to purchase one for me next.
1,Tune Free FM,It didn't work and I can not use it but I don't have the package and I don't usually send anything back so I waste my money
5,DA man CHiznock,"Choclair is the best rapper out of Canada i have heard to date. i first heard his ""21 years"" twelve-inch about two years before ""ice cold"" came out, and i have to admit i was starving for the full album. if you are going to buy a copy of this cd, make sure it has the song with Rahzel on it, i'm not sure why but i have seen several of his cds that didn't have that track."
4,Dope Rhymes from north of the border,"His rhymes are mad tight. Just listen to Let's Ride. He mentions Joe Carter hitting a home run against Philly in the 93 World Series. This guy's on point! And rather than having an album where he is outshined by guests, he actually carries this album all by himself. The joints with Guru and Memph Bleek are hot, but that's because the guests compliment Choclair's skills. After you listen to Let's Ride, Bare Witness, Rubbin, and Young Gunz, the lyrics will be stuck in your head. The next day you'll be yearning to listen to it again. Choclair is a pleasant surprise and a welcomed change."
3,"Good, but could have been better","Choclair has some great rhymes and an almost unmatched flow, but the beats on this album are very simple, as are the insturmentals. I don't know, maybe that's the Canadian style. If it is, this is probably the last Canadian album I am purchasing, as I prefer the sounds of the dirty south which are very different from what Choclair is. But his flow and rhymes are what hold this album down, and if that is what you look for in an album, then this is a must have."
4,"good tea, terrible packaging","I'm trying to maintain a healthy amount of daily caffein-free, sugar-free liquid intake, but plain water gets a bit boring after a while. Rooibos tea is great: fragrant, convenient, and it's even supposed to be anti-oxidant. The only problem is that the packaging of this product is ridiculously annoying. The plastic is very difficult to peel. I had to struggle with it for like 5 minutes, even with the help with my swiss army knife. Had to take one star off."
3,"OK, I'll give it three stars. The first review was one star.",I gave this product one star the first time around but I think I figured it out so I'm now giving it three stars. When I first received the 6-pack of this tea and opened it up it smelled like sewer sludge. The expiration date is over 2 & 1/2 years away so perhaps this is a very fresh shipment. After a day on the countertop the smell subsided quit a bit. I poured the boiling water over a bag and let it set for about five minutes. When I placed my honker over the cup its smell was still very strong but it also started to subside very quickly.The taste reminded me of dirt so I gave it a packet of stevia which made it drinkable unlike the first time I made this tea. I was surprised at the smell and taste after about half way through the cup. It now seems very pleasant and drinkable. I might move it up another star or two after I get use to it.
1,Great Pencil! - Watch Out for Seller...,"I use these pencils daily and was very excited to find what I thought would be a very good purchase. The wording of the listing implies that they are selling a box of 12 pencils, and in conjunction with a picture of the box that would be understandable right? In reality they are selling singular pencils, but one would only know that if they delved all the way into the fine print of the listing. Please exercise CAUTION before finalizing your purchase, unless you feel comfortable paying more than $12 for one (1) pencil..."
1,no one has a vhs any more,i want the cd's no one eveh owns a vsh anymore most everyone has digital media players now a day
1,Ralph Paul,"I thought i was getting the DVD collection, recieved VCR tape. I guess i will be ordering again. You need to be more specific on the details."
2,No Zen...,"I think that studying birth, learning focused relaxation, using biblical imagery like lying down in green pastures, is better than blanking out one's mind."
3,"Great concept, but some poor advice","I bought this book because I was moved by the concept of 'birthing from within', which I interpreted as: getting past one's fears abound birth, and using creative ways of expressing feelings.It was a surprise to find in this book suggestions like having peroxide to put on the cord after a homebirth. When I saw that, I flipped to the front cover to see the publication date, and was amazed to see this is a recent publication (1998)- it's been known for years now that the cord heals best if left alone.More shocking to me was the advice (p.273-5)to introduce a bottle to the baby at 3-4 weeks of age (Contrary to the WHO code!) The authors say they do not recommend exclusively breastfeeding on demand.If you purchase this book, be sure to rely on others for more current and accurate infant care advice. I hope a new edition will contain more appropriate advice. For the time being, I suggest you view this book with caution."
2,Not for me,"If you want a book that gives you many wonderful prompts for artfully exploring your fears and desires regarding an impending birth then GET THIS BOOK. It's probably exactly what you want.That was not what I was looking for. I didn't feel any better prepared after reading it than before. I don't need to explore my fears. I am a worrier by nature and I really don't need any more help confronting all the things that could go wrong. I especially don't need to bring them to life with colored pencils.Ina May's Guide to Childbirthmade me feel empowered and excited about giving birth naturally and I would recommend it before this title.Also, the Kindle version, as of this date, is FULL of typos and text anomalies."
2,birthing from within is a bit biased,"While the first few chapters of this book are amazing (encouraging artistic expression to help with birth and labor), the rest of the book feels like propaganda for anti-hospital/medicated births, often telling frightening stories and sharing scary artwork about hospital/medicated births. I was hoping it would be something that would give me peace of mind rather than attempting to make me feel frightened by doctors, hospitals, medication, nurses, etc ... If you plan to have a birth that involves the safety of a hospital, this book probably isn't right for you, as it uses mild fear tactics to try and lure you out of that decision."
5,Wonderful book,"I just finished the book last night. I have thoroughly enjoyed doing some of the birth art exercises and just thinking about my pregnancy and birth from a different perspective (beyond the physical - i.e. looking at pregnancy, labor, and birth from a spiritual and emotional aspect).If you are looking for a ""what to expect"" type book, this is not for you."
5,Never Stop Seeking Enlightenment!,"A Divine Revelation of Heaven by Mary K. Baxter and, T. L. Lowery is a book that promotes the Gospel and the necessity for all of us to seek salvation. Her visions of Heaven and Hell are inspiring. Her journey into Heaven is thought provoking. She sticks very close to scripture in her work.+ + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Are you a spiritual retard, or are you on the path to ENLIGHTENMENT?+ + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +"
1,A Divine Revelation of Heaven,"I was very disappointed with the book and am returning it. This woman is clearly delusional and she just imagines what heaven would be like based on the biblical quotes in the book. It is very poorly written, repetitious and boring. I think she's just writing down what she says in her preachings. Why would Jesus Christ show her heaven? And if she really did, why didn't see the Virgin Mary, mother of Christ and Queen of heaven? She is obviously a fake."
1,Ridiculous,"This book bored the crap out of me so much I had to stop half way through. I read divine revelation from hell simply because I like horror movies. If this is heaven, how is it possible not to get inspired? Nope, this book is bs...that's why. This is not a genuine story. It reads worse then a childrens fairytale. I had more fun reading Alice in Wonderland. Tears in bottles? You've got to be joking. Is this the best you can come up with Mary."
5,Brooklyn's Finest,"This album is perfect for anyone who has heard some stuff from the boot camp clik and wants more. And how could you not want more if you've ever heard any of these songs? This is basically a compilation of the best joints from Black Moon, OGC, Heltah Skeltah, and the Cocoa Brovaz(Smif N Wessun). The Black Moon tracks are some of the best the rap game has ever produced. The best part is that it includes the remix of I Got Cha Opin, which wasn't on Enta da Stage. I Aint Havin That, Black Trump, and Sound Bwoy Bureill are the best non Black Moon joints. You can't possibly cop this album and not be satisfied."
5,Good Quality,"Bought these for my son as he is into art/shading/drawing/sketching. I wasn't sure if they would hold up with how inexpensive they are, but they do hold up, very high quality lead. He took them to art class in high school and even the art teacher said they were a good quality."
5,Outstanding Parenting Material (Tape Series),"Buntman is an unusual author in the field of ""help for parents."" His material is practical and you can put it into practice immediately when you are through listening to the tapes. He doesn't talk about theory; he talks about specific suggestions that really work. His material is based on his over 25 years of doing counseling and therapy with children and teens. This tape series gives you the basic skills to parent a child and teen. When you are finished with these tapes, you can really put the suggestons into practice. This is material that every parent should have; it is must listening!The skills that Buntman teaches will help build your child's self-esteem, help you communicate better with him and help guide him in the difficult journey through life. This is for parents of 6-year-olds to 19-year-olds."
3,so far so good...but...,"I can say its powing amp, but wire quality is lacking compared to my other 4 guage wire. too mich coating and wire is soft. it works till i can upgrade. worth the price though."
2,Cheap cheap cable,If you want to run 8 gauge wire in 4 gauge casing go for it. I would not recommend this to a friend.
3,"Sturdy Device For Windows 98SE, 2000, ME, XP.","I was disappointed that this device would not let me drag drop files from my MacBook. Thumbs down.The Installation CD for the YP-U1 is designed for Windows 98E/2000/ME/XP REV 5.0However, the build quality is very good.So, it is a good device if you have an old Windows computer to use it with."
4,"Good quality, but no performance increase","Bought these for a Burgman AN400 as replacement to the good-quality OEM filters. If you use them, don't expect some miraculous performance increase. Instead, what you should expect is to avoid changing them out so soon. The filter is high-quality material, and you can skip changing it for one interval. Some anal-retentive burger owners change it every time they change their oil, but these you can keep going for 2 or 3 oil changes. They seem to give your oil a reddish tint, though. I don't think that affects performance at all."
5,One of the best hip-hop albums I've heard in a long time.,"This album is a breath of fresh air from an artform dying from a lack of oxygen.All of the guests do their thing, especially Invincible, Finale, Waajeed, Jay Dee (RIP), Phat Kat, and MF DOOM.Highly recommended for any beatheads or hip-hop fans in general. Don't sleep!!"
3,Steiner's for deployment,"I was deployed do an OEF op and needed a pair of binos. They work great and even came with a case and cleaning cloth. The only problem now is that one side doesn't hold itself up, so even though they are small; it is a two handed operation to look through these. I used to be able to just use these one handed, other than that they work fine."
5,gift,This product was a gift and I have never seen it function. I believe the recipient was happy with the product
1,Huh?,I seemed to try to find a deeper meaning to this book...and maybe I'm paranoid but I think all her friends might have tried to drive Lisa crazy so they could have her boyfriend...atleast maybe Betsy did...anyone else think this at all?
3,It was okay....,"The book was okay, but it wasn't great. I was really interesting on how Lisa acted, but besides that there really wasn't anything else. I didn't like how it was in another character's point of view. I think it would have been better if Lisa told the story. I didn't like the ending either. It was a good read, but I won't read it again..."
2,dim and dim,"While searching for books, I ran into this one, and by the back, it seemed highly interesting. Not to mention, it was recommended by a lover of ""Go Ask Alice"". Anyhow, the basic fact is that is was disappointing and unexciting. I think the most disappointing part is that it was not raw in any sense. You will not read anything you don't already know about madness. It makes you wonder if this author does in fact know anything about it. Which it seems he doesn't. Don't waste your time."
5,Underrated Classic,"This is perhaps one of the best young adult books ever written and it is extremely underrated. You practically never hear about it because it goes more into the reality of mental illness than the fluff of mindless girls dating mindless boys. This book tells the story of Lisa, a girl who is ""losing her mind"" and the only people who seem to notice are her friends. Her parents are basically either in denial or are ignoring it. Her teachers just think she's acting out. Only her friends seem to notice that she's spiraling out of control. They develop a plan to rescue her from herself, but they have to hurry before she does too much damage to herself."
4,Lisa Bright and Dark,"Lisa Bright and Dark is a brilliantly written novel. It goes into the mind and innerworkings of a confused teen girl. She thinks she hears British voices that lead her to insanity and suicidal tendencies. I would suggest this book to teens within the age range of 14-17, or anyone interested in pshycology."
2,Poor Video Quality,"I don't usually review anything unless I feel very strongly about it, one way or the other. In the case of ""Live In Geneva"", while I generally agree with most of the reviews here, I was surprised to see little mention of the video quality of this DVD. It is terrible! Whether deliberate (which I doubt) or not, the image is soft and muddy. It has the appearance of something shot on video back in the 70s. It leaves your eyes fatigued from constantly trying to focus, to no avail. To add insult to injury, they constantly throw in deliberately de-focused shots and grainy black and white clips. Did they think this was ""arty"" or what?The video quality of this DVD was poor enough to significantly impair my ability to enjoy the concert. It would be best to leave the TV off and just listen to the audio through you sound system. What WERE they thinking?!"
1,Cheap junk,"This light is made from the cheapest of light plastic. Mine arrived nonfunctional, with the bulb rattling around loose inside the body of the light. I managed to get it back in the socket and the unit is operating for the moment, but I wonder how long it will last."
1,very high failure rate,"this is an essential item for in-car navigation, however very poor design or quality of manufacturing - the units fail pretty quickly and then you no longer get a charge. also the suction cup doesn't stay stuck, and you end up with your $400 palm falling to the floor of your vehicle - perhaps damaging it or at least distracting you in the middle of driving."
1,There are better books!,"This is a true stinker. The text is riddled with self-justification and the third draft of the included screen play is just a true prize. Buy Ken Dancyger's book ""alternative screenwriting"" instead, 'cause that's brilliant."
1,*I* might as well have written this book,"I am truly amazed that this book is in publication. Berman has literally no credentials to write such a book. In over ten years he has not even managed to *get an agent*! And this guy is supposed to tell *us* how to do it? Wow.Aside from the obvious shortcomings mentioned above, this book requires you to read an entire screenplay by the author - and it is terrible - so he can teach you his methods. Okay. His methods haven't managed to even get him as far as acquiring an agent in ten years. What in God's name could we learn from a script that can't even land a published author an agent in a decade?Under no circumstances should you waste a penny on this book. Its very existence undermines the work of others who actually have a right to author a book on the subject."
4,"Wonderful, sweet - one to remember",This sweet tale of a boy overcoming his fears has been a bedtime favorite of my boys for years. The easy flow of the text and interesting detail in the the illustrations makes it a pleasure for parents and kids alike. I'm ordering 2 hardbacks now to give my boys when they have kids.
1,"great product, deceptive sales practices","The product description shows up as:3x Pentel(R) Sharplet-2(tm) Automatic Pencil, 0.5 mm, BlackSold by: Bargain Basement (seller profile)and the picture shows three pencils but the actual item only includes one pencil. the product specifications refer to only one pencil but it is too easy to believe there would be three coming with this order. very disappointedthe pencil is great, the product description and picture are deceptive"
4,saving grace with tom conti a must see,"I saw this movie years ago and have been waiting ever since for it to be shown again. Tom Conti is wonderful as the Pope who leaves the Vatican to live with the common people. It is a thoroughly heartwarming movie. You'll smile, you'll cry and you'll rejoice. Giancarlo Giannini gives a wonderful performance as a priest who has lost his faith.This really is a must-see movie.Connie"
5,A good company to do business with,"I ordered the movie ""Amazing Grace"" with Tom Conti and Retro Rocket Entertainment has been excellent to deal with. they were prompt in answering my concerns and very good about helping me with my concerns. they are excellent to do business with and I would recommend them highly."
5,Hope For All,This was the most moving book I have read in a very long time. I could not put it down and read it cover to cover in one night. It will give strength and hope to anyone who has to battle a serious medical condition or has to battle the downfall of a relationship.
4,Before Sid's time.,Actually the bass was dubbed on by Glen Matlock years after it was originaly recorded.
2,This case depends on your usage.,"I can see this case being a good purchase if you weren't planning on moving too much with it. I had it for about a week and the first trip that I took it on there were corners of my Mac bent in and obvious frame damage. And it was even in my backpack. It won't even protect from most minor bumps it seems. If you're looking for a good protector, this is not it. Look elsewhere. But a decent around the house case I guess."
4,Greatest moments,Listen Joan Armatrading is for me a great pleasure. The Gold is a especial and admirable moment.
2,"So much potential, but sadly disappointed","I've read a great deal of material on dice setting and controlled throwing. The early books on this same subject, though not as slick looking, address this topic more fully. If you want the real deal on dice setting and rhythmn rolling, stick with the classic books which started it all, Scoblete, Feinberg and Kononenko. Very disappointed."
4,Great case!,"Considering that you cannot find a case whatsoever in any store for the Zen Sleek, I was a little apprehensive about buying this without ever seeing it in person. I was pleasently suprised. The case fits wonerfully and does not in anyway distort the sleekness of this device. The only issue I have, as mentioned in a previous review is the metal screw holder built into the back. It's really not that noticable and after a couple of hours I'm over it. Highly reccomended product!"
2,crayola,The crayola water color pencils are wonderful. The price for them could be lower though. They are a wonderful crayola iteam.
5,Great colored pencils!,The colors are vibrant. They spread as paint nicely when you apply the water. They do a really nice job. They are bargain for what you get.
1,DOES NOT FIT 350 CHEVY V8 (5.7 liter): 2000 Tahoe Z71,"DOES NOT FIT 350 CHEVY V8 (5.7 liter). The AMAZON ""Make Sure it Fits"" is not correct. This kit only comes with 6 short ignition wires. My Chevy Tahoe requires at least 8 plug wires + 1 coil wire. Had to return it."
4,A good mechanical pencil.,"This pencil has a very light feel in the hand and is thinner than a lot of mechanical pencils on the market. The smooth body rests comfortably in the crook of the hand where between the thumb and the first finger joint. Light grooves near the point of the pencil give enough grip for the fingers without being so pronounced as to cause discomfort after extended use. The lead feeds well by clicking down the cap at the top of the pencil. This same metal cap can be removed to expose an eraser. The eraser is narrow but rather long, so should give plenty of use. The clip is sturdy and does not pop off easily."
3,YELLOW OVERKILL,I just purchased the lamp to match the nursery bedding set..and although I think its a bit overpriced...(45 dollars is kinda high for a baby lamp)...i think theres way too much yellow in it...the company should've balanced all the colors into this lamp instead of yellow!!
2,It's OK,"I bought this lamp because it went along with the peek a pooh collection. I hardly use it. It's in my daughters room, but mostly for decoration. I only gave it 2 stars because I haven't used it so I dont know how well it works. I like the other idea about buying a wood lamp and using the excess border. Much cheaper."
1,"R-E-P-E-T-I-T-V-E (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey....!)","I love Manu Chao, but this live CD is not worth your money.From the first track, the listener is bombarded with familiar manu tracks set to a constant backbeat of hey! hey! hey! hey! ad nauseam. Nearly every song features that repetitive background vocal, and, while initially the album strikes one as energetic, upbeat, and fresh, it quickly becomes stale about halfway through the twenty-plus tracks, burying itself in its own droning, repetitive vibes.Energy in a live performance isn't created just by making your audience jump up and down to a ""hey!"" beat.Two hours of this amid a sweaty audience and too much beer in your system might work, but on a CD, it translates to music that annoys.Stay away."
5,A good new album,This was a good CD of David Bowie. I enjoyed every part of this quality album. It was shipped quickly! philboatbike
3,Good But Not Great,"I have to admit, the first time I listened to this album I didn't like it all but after a few spins it's grown on me, though there really are no standout songs. Lightweight pop Bowie with a superficial nod to early works."
1,Very dissapointed.,"I bought this product after reading the reviews. After watching some amateurs do bollywood dancing, I really wanted to try it out, as it looks like an attractive and fun style of dance. I made two attempts at completing this DVD and found that this dance workout did not consist of fun bollywood dance moves, but was mostly made up of boring stretch movements. I wanted to give this product zero stars as I don't plan on using it again, which really highlights the fact that I got nothing out of this DVD. However, amazon seemed to let me give a minimum of one!"
2,"Cute, but not much of a workout","Hemalayaa is beautiful and sultry, as are her ""two sisters"" who assist. Lovely ""eye candy""; the music would be fun if one could actually listen to it while ""dancing""; however, Hemalayaa chatters incessantly through it. It was difficult to get our heart-rates up, and there was a lot of ""down time"" doing the hip shimmy, which could have been utilized illustrating other dance steps. It was fun the first time we tried it, but we haven't used it since."
3,Okay but not great,"I have tried this video a few times. The problem I have is that she jumps right into the steps without either an explanation or slowed down version of what she is doing. It says that it is for all experience levels, but as a novice in this type of dance (I have some bellydance under my belt), I didn't feel that it catered to a beginner. I had a difficult time keeping up and would get frustrated because she would change things up so quickly. I'm going to give it another chance because I'm hoping I will be able to get the hang of it, but it was difficult for me to keep up, except for during the cool down."
3,Fun but problems - Beware,"This is fun and upbeat. A decent workout and loved the music. But they go from a slow pace to show you the move and then jump to a very fast pace. It's doable but will take some time to get up to speed. Beware however one very dangerous move!!! She does a ""jump into deep plie"" move that is down right dangerous and could easily and severely tear groin muscles - a very very bad injury. No one should even try this move unless they are so fit that they can do those ""jump into a full split"" moves like the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. Otherwise it's fun and has decent cardio potential. The music is fantastic ""get you moving"" music. If not for the dangerous move, I would have rated it higher."
1,Wow...Surprisingly bad...,"This product was the worst exercise video I have ever done, and that includes the old vhs Tony Little workouts! The warmup focused more on the neck that large muscle groups, the actual workout was quite fast paced for a beginner, the voice-over instructions didn't alwasys sync with what was on the screen, and the transition from one set to the next was very awkward. I finally stopped when they began doing a squat-type exercise that involved putting your knees all the way over your feet, which as any trainer knows is bad bad bad!All in all, I would save your money!"
2,Surprisingly boring,"I love dance workouts but this is very disappointing. Bad cues. Bad camera work -- too many closeups on face when you need to see what the body is doing. And worse, the routine is boring. Bollywood is fun and exciting, but not this. It would be hard to get a workout if you are in half decent shape. I'd skip it."
1,Boring,"I enjoy dance dvds for something different or for a lighter day if I have already done some cardio or weight training. I like the music and the idea of this, but the cueing was bad, the moves were boring - hip shakes in place, spine stretches, yawn. Face stretches were simply silly.Wasn't for me, but sounds like it's a 50/50 chance as others seem to have enjoyed it."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was hoping for a little more maybe then she gave, while the workout was fun, it was too choppy to keep me engaged, with too many pauses and segments, and it did a lot of jumping moves. I was hoping maybe for something a little more like belly dance, with smoother moves. Kinda hurt my knees and I don't have knee trouble. I would only suggest this to some one who loves Bollywood and knows what it is before they start. I had trouble keeping up with this, maybe start with a basic learn the steps program before doing this. Also, if you have trouble with your computer running programs with pauses this will make you crazy.Don't do it unless you have a smooth stream on your internet connection. But try it you may like it if you like Bollywood."
1,"Good for exercise, but that's it...","I've done a few different Bollywood DVDs and this is basically a typical exercise dvd.. Definitely would not use it to learn Bollywood.The moves that she does are often sloppy, and the facial exercises are pretty silly."
4,Very fun,This was just as much fun as I thought it was going to be and it was a much needed break from my tougher workout videos. It's soft and fun and just flows. If you need something different this is the workout to do.
5,It worked for me,"I thought this book was great. I read it on my way to Vegas, and tripled my money. Yes, it's for beginners, but it teaches you tips and lingo so you don't look, sound, or play like one."
5,Fun way to play Game Boy,"With this port, you could play Game Boy games on your Super Nintendo, so you were not stuck with the small screen of the original Game Boy. You could also play with the colors, making the game stand out with various palettes, and you could even draw on the screen, having fun with various game scenes and characters. It was a real hoot to play with way back when me and my brothers had this and the SNES."
2,Disappointed,"After watching Little Mermaid 2, I was quite excited for this sequel. The story line is a bit depressing. Not only does her mother die (this is Disney afterall) but then the whole story is about how her father is a real downer afterwards. There's not enough time and too many sisters to really get a good handle on who is who. The music is good. If my daughter chooses to watch it again I think it will be for the music. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. I think this one will be a dust collector."
3,A better movie,This movie was interesting as we get to know Ariel's sisters more.I found this movie better than The Little Mermaid 2.The Little Mermaid 2 was the original movie played in reverse as Ariel's daughter wants to be a mermaid.
3,watchable,"i rented this dvd for my 5 year old daughter. and while watching this with her i got caught up in the story line and ended up watching to the end. but after reading the other reviews , i couldnt believe others thought the movie was horrible. i have to admitt that it did not have all of the music from the first movie, but in the end my daughter liked it. its a movie for kids. so i would recommened this movie to people who have small children who enjoyed the first little mermaid."
4,not as good as the original but still adorable,"Everyone has wondered what Ariel's mother had been like. This prequel definietly gives you that insight. I truly enjoyed this movie, yes it wasnt like the original but look at all the Cinderellas they have made, they werent like the original either. Ariel's beginning was in a way like the movie Footloose, no music or dancing is allowed in the city of Atlantis because King Tritain is heartbroken. But as always, the movie has a happy ending that leaves you feeling satisfyed that all is well. As well as being introduced to Ariel's mother you also learn and see more of Ariel's sisters. I felt that Disney did a good job overall and that I was glad I rented it from work. My little sister also watched it with me and came to the same conclusion."
5,My daughter loves this movie,I bought this and the other little mermaid movies for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. This was an awsome movie. LOVE IT. Would definatly buy from this seller again.
3,Not just a made-up sequel,"Actually, this was made into a book around 1999. I work at a library and had come across the book entitled: ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"". I read it, and after seeing the trailers for the movie, I'm positive that Disney has just adapted the book into another sequel movie. So this movie is not just some made up movie sequel."
5,the little mermaid 3: Arial's Beginning,"i don't now about anybody else, but i am really looking forward to this DVD; i have been a huge fan of Disney and The Little Mermaid since i first watched it-besides, i absolutly love anything Disney!"
2,A Footloose remake?,"Is it just me or does this not sound a lot like the movie Footloose? The main female character in that movie was named Ariel and her father was the one who outlawed music in the town. I loved both The Little Mermaid and Footloose movies, but I'm just thinking, ""where is the originality Disney? Come on."""
1,poor quality,"I bought this camera for my many snorkeling trips worldwide. The first trip I took it on was the Maldives and I was really excited to get some great underwater shots. I took it out on the reef in fairly calm conditions and the camera failed and never would turn back on. I was really upset at this but figured that the company would replace it, however when I sent it to them they said the seals were fine so they would not replace it. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
4,Easy to carry and has all the tools for call maintenence,"A must have in your turkey call bag. You could carry chalk, scrub pads, stones etc. but it's a mess. It's all in this compact package. Good design and really handy."
2,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with the new Civ 4. I felt as if the graphics had regressed to pre Civ 3 quality. Also, when reaching the industrial time frame, portions of the graphics (mostly cities) would lose their color and turn black. I eventually uninstalled Civ 4 and reinstalled Civ 3 (a better version of the game)."
4,Awesome!,The download for Mac was awesome. Worked perfectly. only complaint is that the graphics glitch every so often but is usually easily fixed. I love the civ series and once I found out that I could download it straight to my macbook pro I had to give it a try. I was worried that it wouldn't work properly but it's much better than I expected! My experience was easy with a fast download and easy instructions so I suggest that everyone that has a macbook pro and wants to download it to give it a shot.
2,"1.61 patch is much better than the initial release, but still slow","Ignore the system requirements at your own risk, because this thing runs like a fat sow on any machine more than a few months old. On my iMac G5 bought just a year ago, it's effectively unplayable at even the lowest graphics settings -- and that's at only 2000 BC! I won't even attempt to see what it's like with a full, modern world. Very disappointing.UPDATE: Performance is massively improved by the 1.61 patch (released on 31 July 2006), but it still slows down quite a bit after a few thousand years. As before, ignore the system requirements at your own risk."
2,"Great game. Crashes on my new MacBook Pro, though.","I received this game as a gift because I am a fan of the older versions and the playstation version. This game is more robust than the playstation version, which makes it more satisfying and strategic. But it continually crashed, didn't save, and eventually stopped working. I only completed one full game, which was interrupted by crashes. I have a McBook Pro, which was purchased new in 2010. I guess you need one of those made-for-gaming computers to play Civ on the computer."
4,Fun,"I like this game quite a bit. I am thinking about getting at least one of the expansion packs. At this time, the only little critique I have is the diplomacy part, in that it seems to be difficult to demand things from your computer opponents. I like the flexibility of the tech tree, and all the different units available to build. Overall, a very good game!"
1,Would be good if it didn't crash,"Even with the latest patch from Aspyr this game was unplayable for me. It crashed (requiring a reboot) every 10 minutes.During those 10 minutes the game seemed like it would be fun, but it was simply too frustrating to try to play through the crashes."
4,Nice game but you have to be aware that is not for the current OSX Tiger system so you may have some problems,"Sometimes while playing the game, if you have the ibook with OSX Tiger you may experience some problems because this game is not designed for the intel procesor. But dont worry, at least the game has autosaving.The game as usual, is great, you can spend hours playing"
1,"Great game, technical issues","I'm a big fan of the game, but I had some serious technical issues with the download. Whenever I tried to install the game my macbook would crash. I've downloaded several other programs from Amazon and never had a problem, but I couldn't get this game to install without the system crashing. I finally had to download a copy from the Mac App Store, which ran perfectly."
2,NOT compatible with MOUNTIAN LION,I would love to have tried out this game....but it is NOT compatible with MOUNTAIN LION. I'm receiving a refund as we speak. Just wanted to give the heads up. Do NOT purchase this product if you're working with MOUNTAIN LION.
1,Not even worth $4.99,"This game doesn't work properly. I can play it, but the whole time there are streaks of colour across the top 1/4 of the screen that kind of make me want to have a seizure. I don't think it's my computer, but just for completeness, I'm using the newest (2012) Macbook air: 1.8 GHz i5, 4 Gb RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4000 384 MB, OS X.8. I would like my $5 back."
5,A true classic!,"All I can say about this album is that it's a masterpiece. A classic in every way...truly GREAT songs...every single one of them! I love how Neil plays guitar on a bunch of the tracks, as well. Another review was completely right, too...some of his greatest playing can be found here.One of my favorite things about Crazy Horse's ""Crazy Moon"" is that Frank ""Poncho"" Sampedro, Billy Talbot AND Ralph Molina each have a chance to shine on lead vocals. Each one of them has the perfect voice for the music, in my opinion. This album has a magic quality to it for me. It's definitely an album I'll always carry with me forever. I'm 24 now...so I still have plenty of time to treasure this piece of timeless art.If you love Neil's work with Crazy Horse...or any of Crazy Horse's other solo albums, you're bound to find a lot to love about ""Crazy Moon""."
5,Just wonderful,"This is the best book I've read on writer's block, or how to be nicer to yourself when your writing isn't going well. It deals from the inside out, not concentrating as much on techniques (there are lots of books that focus on workmanship around), but instead helps you look on what's going on inside you and what led you to being blocked.I've been reading this book slowly for several months, parcelling out the chapters and stretching the experience. It's helped me a lot with my writing. I simply love this book!"
5,Highly recommended,"Highly recommended CD. A blend Of Rock, Jazz, Indian and diversity of great sound of guitars. As mentioned in the previous review, If you are into Jazz, Joni Mitchell, John McLaughlin, a bit of Zappa; This album is a great start for you to hear Leni in some of her best songwriting"
3,New Tune!,"This is a pretty O.K video. Though it's not the best looney tune cartoon video in the world, it's pretty good.It includes a lot of the classic looney tune cartoons that if you are a big looney tune cartoon fan, you have probably seen 1,000 times. For example: ""Golden Yegs"", ""Stuper Salseman"" and ""Show Biz Bunny"". But it also introducios a relativley new cartoon caled, you guessed it, ""Superior Duck"". Which is another takeoff of superman starring Daffy Duck."
2,She loved it for about 2 hours,We have a small female boxer and she loved this toy. It seemed like it would be very durable. Unfortunately it proved to be much less durable than it appeared. Within two hours of use she had torn one of the ends off and removed the plastic water bottle (the source of the crackle and crunch) from inside. Too bad. I had high hopes for this one.
3,What a piece of fluff.,"After reading the first ten pages, you know the book. I wasn't expecting Tolstoi, but I'll be .. I'm tired of Mary had a little lamb.If you like Harlequin romances, buy this book, if you're looking for substance, move on."
3,Very Blurry Bootleg Copy I purchased,I thought that I was purchasing a valid non bootleg old VHS tape of this movie.I purchased several and they were all the same very blurry degraded vhs copy.
1,I would rather have a toothache....,"...than watch this movie again. Of the three of us who watched it, I was the only one who remained awake. Poor casting, mediocre story line, and just an all around lousy movie."
1,Fedora leashed,This book is not for the person who wants to use Fedora as an OS. It is geared for someone who is into programming and is very complicated. It assumes you have a doctorate in Computer Science. I would never recommend anyone to buy this book. Fedora Core for dummies would be a much better bargain than this book.
2,I don't know about this one . . .,"I'm not too sure about this one. I tried to go into it with an open mind, especially after being warned that it was a ""little strange."" Having enjoyed books such as Ishiguro's ""Unconsoled"" and other Kafka-esque novels, I was ready for anything. However, unfortunately, this book didn't seem to go anywhere. The story was interesting, as was the transformation of Quinn . . . but unfortunately, ""interesting"" doesn't make a good novel. Perhaps if the author had gone a bit deeper in his explanations and descriptions, and didn't limit himself to a mere 200 pages, something would have come of it. Unfortunately, i feel like the nights i spent reading this book were wasted time. I kept telling myself to go on . . . . that in the end it would be worth it. Finally, as I turned the last page, I realized i was wrong . . ."
1,teddibly clever but... not finishable,"very mannered, but where is the substance and ... it just gets very tiresome after awhile... I didn't make it through book 1...it was amusing for awhile but . . . blah"
5,Whutta Wok,"Its a great little wok perfectly sized for my glass top electric stove. It cleans up nice, handle stays cool. Perfect size for making meals for two. I've very happy with it. The price was very reasonable as was shipping charges. It arrived quickly and was packaged very well."
5,Fantastic if incomplete overview of rock,"This series does an admirable job of covering the history of ""rock""--whatever that term really means anymore. As a rabid fan of indie rock, I wish there'd been some attention paid to such bands as The Replacements who embody the term ""rock and roll"" to me at least as much as The Stones do. I understand, however, that there's no way they could cover what ""rock"" is to everyone. I still loved this series, especially the ""Punk"" episode which was revealing, funny, sad, and fascinating."
4,Excellent reference to complement other sources,"The usefulness of this product depends on the purpose for which you buy it. If you simply want a historical review, it is exdcellent, lots of music tracks and interviews with artists. If you are a serious student, this is good to fill in some of the blanks not covered by other sources.The role of the narrator is minimised and the material is presented mainly with comments from artists and the continuity is quite good.In all, a very good addition to those who are interested in rock history and is a fine companion to the 'Dancing in the Street' series."
3,Interesting But Incomplete,"This is a very good documentary on the subject of credit card debt and predatory lending, but doesn't pack the emotional punch of a similar documentary titled Maxed Out that came out roughly at the same time. The documentary shows as a society that the middle and lower classes are drowning in a sea of debt from payday loan places and credit card debt. It offers some good advice and gives a lot of cause for concern, but leaves you with a feeling of unanswered questions and wanting more information. It does however show you that debt is often not caused by stupidity or foolishness but by circumstances that could affect any one of us."
5,Helpful Resource For Christian Counsellors,"The contributors to this volume, which has been re-printed, are conservative and Bible-honoring in their attempt to define and present Biblical ethics. A fact that proves conservative scholars are the best.FAITHFULNESS:'Implies a commitment to certain ideals, relationships, or courses of action, and the ability to continue supporting them even in the face of adverse circumstances.' p 145"
4,Another GREAT Canadian band unnoticed!,"Chilliwack has made some great rock/AOR music yet, sadly, like many bands from Canada never crossed over into the US market. Haven't kept up on what or if they are still active today or in what form but it's the USA's loss they never took notice!"
1,How did this get published?,"This ""author"" has a very hard time with the english language: She can't spell, she can't construct sentences; she can't construct paragraphs. Not to mention she hates men."
5,Long title...quick read for busy Moms,"I like this book for it's practicality, simplicity and the fact that the author, whether intentional or not, made this an easy read that doesn't consume more of your time than necessary. Some of these suggestions are fairly common sense, others are eye-opening suggestions that could certainly make for practical use. Her writing style is not superior or overly-authoritative but more personal and conversational. Like reading a letter from a good friend who's ""been there""."
1,Look Elsewhere,"My shredder also worked well at first, but even with lubrication, it continued to loose cutting power until a max of three sheets was all it could handle. Then it jammed bit time. I disassembled the unit and found that the drive was all plastic gears and the small drive motor gear had worn all the teeth down to nothing. Nothing left to do but trash it and go shopping for a different brand. It was just under a year old and only used for my personal use which was actually pretty light."
4,tears of the moon,"tears of the moon by nroa robertsPart of a trilogy, Ireland, shawn gallagher falls in love, a songwriter.Brnna O'Toole has known Shawn their whole lives and they are friends.Darcy, Aiden and Shawn ran the pub. She is a Jill of all trades and helps her father with construction and repairs. She had fixed the oven at Shawns and then beat on his piano to his song when she saw the ghost Gwen with a hidden message.Shawn tells her he doesn't want her in a sexual way. she jumps him and he takes a sample...She confers with her other girl friends and they tell her to be around him more to see how he's suffering..One of her sisters is having a baby, another is preparing for marriage and she just wants to fix cars and forget about the girly girl things...Burning hot steamy sex add to this book's story...Her sister Mary is also in love with Shawn...She attempts to help with his music career and he doesn't see it as that at all."
1,boring,"I enjoyed Jewels of the Sun, but this one didn't keep my attention. I think I read up to chapter 4 and couldn't continue. The description of Ireland keeps going on and on and the whole ""faerie"" story was boring to say the least. I do recommend Jewels of the Sun, the first book in the trilogy, but stop it there because it doesn't get any better."
4,Nora Roberts,This book was the 2nd in the trilogy & after reading the 1st I had to read all 3 books & I wasn't disappointed. Nora Roberts spinned a tale of magic along with reality. Great read!
4,Great eyepiece!,"This is an excellent eyepiece for viewing planets one I think should have been included with my 6"" dobOrion SkyQuest XT6 Classic Dobsonian TelescopePackaging is excellent, Orion ships the eyepiece with endcaps fitted over both sides to protect the lenses so one can snap them on easily when the eyepiece is not in use."
4,What a Buy!!,"Just wanted you to know what a top quality product this is.We own a small music shop and have ordered this product before,sounds great, easy hook up, we and our customer VERY satisfied.Keep up the good work."
4,Classic Old School for the wrestling collector,"Another great VHS tape by WWF Coliseum Home Video. The main feature of the video being the Macho Man Randy Savage is a plus. Even if you aren't out to collect all the old videos, this one would be worth picking up for any wrestling fan."
3,"Earthy, Urban and Soulful","I am enjoying this CD. The first cut puts you in the mind of Sade, however it is Maysa in all her glory. What a magnificent talent!"
4,Great but Some Songs are Average,"Kill Caustic- 9/10Miss Murder- 10/10Summer Shudder- 8/10The Interview- 8/10Love Like Winter- 7/10Afliction- 9/10The Missing Frame- 8/10Kiss and Control- 6/10The Killing Lights- 9.5/1037mm- 8.5/10Endlessly, She Said- 9/10Rabbits are Roadkill on RT. 37- 9.5/10"
2,Parents Beware,Do not let your children buy this CD. I had to confiscate this from my daughter. Too bad she wasted her money on something that was so extremely inappropriate. Where are the lyric warnings when you need them?
4,Cheers bishes,"I love the hate in this review thread. It's just great. Seriously this is quite a departure from the typical AFI we all skate, grind, olie, and make love too. But on the other hand, This cd is just, well awesome. I've had this cd on rotation pretty much all day, and it's dynamic as hell. I took a chance on the cd, hoping it wouldn't suck, at first the poppy vibes were weird, but it's well constructed, and each song evenly flows into the next.Are AFI a bunch of sellouts? Maybe. Are they creative artists? Hell yes. Well orchestrated CD. If you have an open mind about music, give it a whirl. If you're a die hard, raw militant punk that says OY all day long, this cd will definitely not appeal to you.From one musician to another, rock on AFI, and grats on taking the risk, or selling out or however ya'll wanna put it. This cd effin' rocks!!!!!P.S. Oy Oy Oy Oy!"
2,This band lost it a long time ago,"What a bunch of neutered, over-produced songs tailor-made for MTV. Remember when this band was real? Probably not, the person reading this is probably their new target market group. Go buy Black Sails in the Sunset."
3,"not bad a bad album, but the beginning of the end","this album has its good moments, but its definatly not AFI's best work. I've been listening to AFI since The art of drowning came out. That album was a musical masterpiece. This album is just overproduced techno pop punk with mediocre lyrics, which is very dissapointing because davey havok used to be such a good song writer. AFI used to put on some great live shows, i'm going to see them at the warped tour and i gaurantee i wont even get close to the stage because about a million teenyboppers and preps that would probably look at you like you were stupid if you asked them what they they think of the all hallows ep will be jam packed in there. I'm not trashing this album, but as a long time fan i'm just a little dissapointed at the direction this band is going."
4,a nice progression,"First of all, anyone might have seen this change coming; it is evident on such songs like Death of Seasons on Sing the Sorrow. Davey has been interested in putting electronic beats or whatnot for some time (if anyone went to their website months and months ago, they had Head Like a Hole on there - extremely industrial). Therefore, one could have seen this coming. It's not bad at all, the album is actually very well-written; though it may take some listens before it catches your attention. True, the album is far more poppy than Sing the Sorrow, but does that matter? Don't be musically smug or an elitist when listening to this album (actually, don't be one at all).Nonetheless, the album was a change for AFI to delve into some experimental waters, and they did not do bad at all."
4,"Not my usual Metal, but good music most definitly!","First off I would like to state that AFI is NOT emo. They never have been and they most certainly arent now. And if thats what you classify them as, then you do not have a clue as to how to classify music.Decemberunderground, in my opinion, is much better than Sing the Sorrow. The new album takes on much more of a Alternative Rock influence with true Hardcore-Punk sound and old school 70's Punk Rock guitar riffs. Theres even some good Hardcore-Punk screams in here. To say that this album is bad is just wrong, because it is not. Every track on this album is a good one. Theres even a cool little intro/vocal track thing for those of us who like that kind of stuff. All in all its a great listen, and for me, a change up in my usual tastes. I'll also say that if you were a bigger fan of the stuff before Sing the Sorrow (I'm a fan of their later works) then this album you may not like."
4,First Time Buyer,"This is my first cd of afi and it is a good cd a few real hard songs on it but overall a good cd , i am not usually into this type of music but i listened to the sound samples and thought that it would be a good cd and i wasnt wrong , overall i gave it 4 stars and would recommend this cd to one that likes the hard side of rock , not the best cd i ever owned but definently in the top 10 !"
3,"Kind of cheesy, but OK.","It was rather cheesy, but a good intro for the neophyte. The guy who received it had little to no understanding of football, and it was a good introduction for him."
3,Dark is right!,"I've read more Sandra Brown books than I can recall and each one is different. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the character of Paris was not very well developed. What an empty life she had sentanced herself to. How much quilt does one have to repay? Not only was this DJ allowed to sit in on and contribute to investigative discussions so was the 17 year old Gavin. My what twisted lives those teens lived, imagine them all becoming adults. Watch out world another bunch of twisted offspring. It was indeed suspenseful and kept you guessing on which of the 4 perverts was actually Valentino. They were all guilty of something, some more than others. What a shame those wealthy pampered teens didn't have some good clubs to spend their energies on.Sandra Brown still rates as one of my many read authors."
4,"Hello, Darkness","I love Sandra Brown stories. She never fails to delight. This book was no exception---From front to back, it was all good---"
5,Sandra Brown at her finest!,"Hello Darkness is the 3rd Sandra Brown book Ive read, but definately not the last. Im now a loyal fan and Im looking forward to reading the next one on my list Chill Factor.Hello Darkness will keep you reading nonstop until the last page. I love a book which keeps you guessing about who the killer is and this is the book that does that beautifully.Do yourself a favor and read this book!!!!"
2,I'm glad I didn't buy this book.,"I'm a huge Sandra Brown fan - I've read almost everything she's written, and I usually buy her next book as soon as it is released. I happened upon this book at the library and grabbed it.I was extremely disappointed. There is exactly one compelling theme in this book - the relationship between Dean and the heroine. I did like how their past was revealed little by little, and I found their pain and relationship very realistic.But, the plot surrounding this book is just voyueristic and gross. Rather than finding the mystery interesting, I figured out very quickly that she just kept dragging us in to a suspect, and then throwing fact about another suspect the other direction. I felt jerked around, and not like facts were being revealed naturally. I didn't even care if they ever found the kidnapped girl by the end. There were details in this book that would give any abuse victim flashbacks, and for no real purpose other than to shock and horrify."
5,Excellent,I have read many books by Sandra Brown and I have to say that this book was terrific. The plot was great and from the first page I was hooked. She really knows how to make a great story line with many twists and turns. I recommend this book to everyone. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
3,Bought for a gift,Just ok. No original artista in some cases. Wouldn't recommend. Don't play much. Don't even know where they are at.
2,A bit disappointed !!!,"Sound quality is good compared to other flash based mp3 players. Difficult to manage songs. Whatever you put to it, you have to encrypt by the ""Gigabeat Room"" software provided. I thought it would work like flash drive, just copy from hard drive and run mp3 songs but unfortunately it does not work that way. Every songs is encrypted with .SAT extension so you cannot share your mp3 songs with your friends. Pictures are also encrypted and make double file with *.GBP extension and every file is renamed when encrypted. It took me a lot of time to figure out how to operate this player first time when I received it. I suggest not to buy it if you can spend a few bucks more for iPOD or Creative. Although Toshiba is making improvements in their new line of mp3 players that has video capabilities."
2,stupid toshiba,i bought my gigabeat in may it worked fine til today the screen blacked out on me and now the player will no longer play i dont kno wehter this is because of the recharable battery or toshiba has a faulty product but for all of you planning on using this alot it will last less than a year i would think
1,Toshiba Gigabeat,"Software is very user friendly and pics are ultra clear and supports high resolution pics..BUT.. can't seem to be able to organize my music how I want and that can be a hassle when one has a considerable amount of music stored, considering one can store up to 10,000 songs"
4,Very nice for the money,"So far I am very pleased with my Toshiba Gigabeat, although I don't think I'll ever utilize all of the available space. Using the dock and the Gigabeat software, it is very easy to ""rip"" CD's to the Gigabeat (it takes mere minutes per CD). The remote is a very nice addition.When I first connected my Gigabeat to my pc, my computer would not recognize the hardware. I do run XP, but my version of Media Player was too old (contrary to the published technical requirements). After a bit of a panic, this was easily resolved with a free download and I was in business.My use of it was simply as an audio player. It is simple to create playlists using the Gigabeat software on the PC. I have not explored any of the other more advanced features (ie: photos), but I know it is not compatible with video."
2,the ear,"I bought this excited to put my entire music catalog in a small portable package for car and boat. What's the beef? Well for one, it's not compatible with Windows Media Player 11 which would not recognize it. As a result, it's own software,Gigabite Room, was the only option and Gigabite Room was terrible and full of glitches even after having Toshiba mail me an update disc. Now, after a few months, my Gigabeat 40 doesn't even function and I've thrown it away. No, I'm not electronic devise or computer challenged. No I didn't drop it. Buy at your own risk."
4,Beer for My Horses,too cute. you will laugh for sure. Its no epic movie experience. But certainly enjoyable entertainment. I have watched it twice and reccommended to friends.
4,omg hilarious,"OMG this movie is hilarious and i mean hilarious as in a good comedy. I still dont understand how they got Claire Forlani to play Tobby Keith's love interest. lol Claire is amazing with accents and she pulled of the southern bell accent perfect. Tobby Keith did a nice job as well. You want a good laugh, watch this movie. LOL."
2,What A Waste,"I bought this DVD on a friends recomendation, never listen to him again. The only decent character was Ted Nugent. The acting was week, the story was too predictable and the jokes were all recycled. Might be worth a rental but wasn't a keeper."
1,Huge waste of money!,Movie is a huge waste of money. View for free on CMT TV. Toby Keith should stick to riding horses and Rodney Carrington should stick to telling his potty mouth jokes. Might have had a chance if the script were the least bit interesting. Big yawn and wish I had my money back!
1,Not Redneck Enough I Guess!,I can't tell ya much about the movie because i turned it off after five minutes. Those five minutes were terrible though.
5,Wakeman Does Not Disappoint the Viewer,"Rick Wakeman does not tour very much anymore due to health concerns. I was so hoping they would film this very special show, and yes, they did! 2 shows 5000 seats each show. And that was it.The show is excellent, the sound is good, the dvd is so worth it. Oliver may be touring with YES minus Jon Anderson, but as long as there is a Wakeman in Yes, it's going to be good.Rick wakeman continues to amaze the crowds in his ability to entertain.Buy this dvd. You'll be pleased."
5,I Remember Them...Kind of,"As a black girl growing up in Texas, I was amazed, not so much by Five Star's music video as much as hearing them speak in an interview. Hearing British accents come out of black teenagers mouths, well... I didn't even realize there were black people in England. Perhaps that's why I remember the name of the group but I just can't remember any of their songs. I'm almost tempted to buy the CD just to jog my memory."
2,Not First Choice,The CD is full of good dance music but not by the oringinal artists. (Not for that low price!) I would buy the Eiffel 65 single BLUE first.
3,Love Is Pink is NOT pink,"""Love Is Pink"" turns out to be a peachy color which I didn't want. Otherwise, the gloss seems to stay for a longer period of time. If it were as advertised, I'd give it 4-5 stars."
5,You won't be sorry,"Great CD. Nina Persson is the coolest women in rock! This is one of the better CD that has come out this year, but it's not getting that much press in the USA. If you thinking you might like it, you will so go ahead and buy it."
3,Nina's solo stint,"a good album...very nice songs and some choice cover material. the production is stellar and the crystal clear clarity allows nina's voice to really rest beautifuly upon the music. my only beef is that the album as a whole is too long and the songs begin to dissolve into each other too easily. but the standout tracks are real gems: ""I Can Buy You,"" ""Walking the Cow,"" and ""The Bluest Eyes in Texas."" 3.5 stars"
4,This is a very good record.,"Fans of The Cardigans newer works, Long Gone Before Daylight and Super Extra Gravity, will find lots to like here. Recorded before either of those two albums, it's easy to see where they were going.Stand out tracks include ""Frequent Flyer"", ""I Can Buy You"", and ""The Oddness of the Lord"". The recording is really well done and does well to immerse you in varied textures and moods.Highly recommended!"
3,"Fine quality, but not native speakers","I was under the impression there were native Spanish speakers here, but the kids speak English and it's dubbed Spanish you hear (native Spanish, yes), but the mouths don't match. That's how nearly all DVD's are, but I thought I read this one was just in Spanish, with mouths that match the words. It isn't.Still, it's a cute tape that helps teach numbers, and it's all in Spanish.It's not too long, which is nice because I don't want my kids to watch too much TV."
5,Amazingly great for a Dobermann,"Seems like a perfect balance of value and functionality. Much better than mu old rubber brush, it takes out much more hair. Don't expect it to remove quite as much as Furminator though, but it will not scratch the skin either."
3,Good but not perfect,I've used this a couple of times on my dog that sheds a lot. It takes off a lot of hair but she still sheds a lot. But it doesn't seem to hurt her like other deshedding tool do.
2,Dissappointed,I was encouraged by friends to buy this because they said she was the greatest female singer on Broadway today. I was very disappointed. She is mostly on a Harold arlen kick and she is definitely not the right singer for that material. After hearing Streisand (and only in her early 20's at the time) cover most of this material you will understand why. There is no comparison. While Audra has a great voice on her own - she is not a good pop singer and comes across as emotionless and cold.
1,Disc doesn't play!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! I wanted this disc so bad but when it came in, it did not play in my brand new HDMI Toshiba DVD player. Like the other reviews, the disc freezes. Also, like the other reviewers, I cleaned the disc but nothing improved. The disc plays a few minutes at a time on my brand new Intel iMac then lockes up and crashes the DVD software! My conclusion: The disc is physically fine but the manufacturers screwed up in the quality of the recording/transfer."
5,This guy was hilarious,"Yep, the usual old Don Knott's funniness. Caveat: The Love God's not suitable for a junior high classroom!! Pretty sophisticated adult humor, surprisingly for Don. Anyway, funny stuff."
2,"Nice fit, poor finish","This fits my 4"" shower drain well. The screws were a little big, but it was easy to make them fit in the PVC screw holes. The screws are actually oil rubbed bronze finished.The finish of the drain cover looks like someone painted it with metallic brown paint. The finish is the same as ""bronze"" bathroom accessories at Wal-mart. It's definitely not oil rubbed bronze. I'll probably paint it with some dark brown paint to get a better match with my Delta faucets. The poor finish is probably why I was able to get a returned item from Amazon for $17."
5,Extremely satisfied,This book is a lot better than I expected!Great way for a dynamic but overeasy introduction to Japanese.
5,This book gave me great hope & relief.,"When my 4 1/2yr old was diagnosed in 2002, I was so scared that the fun part of his life was over. I bought 10 books & decided to read this one first. I was so happy & relieved to read about this great woman's calm approach to her boys diabetes. Both of her boys were diagnosed before 7 & continued on to do great things with their lives. This is a must read, it will relieve some of your worries & give you hope that life does go on & your child WILL be just fine."
4,Contemplates the decline of a once mighty empire into a horrible dystopia,"Short's book is probably the best out there about Pol Pot. It describes the rise of this modern day tyrant, his short (but deadly) years in power, and finally his downfall.I read this book shortly after readingGod King of Angkor: A Novel of Tyranny. Where God King portrays Angkor as a mighty, vibrant civilization, Pol Pot: Anatomy of Nightmare depicts a horrific dystopia. It is depressing to contemplate that a society that once achieved such mighty heights descended to the horror and brutality depicted by Short."
1,a tough read,"not for the casual reader - downright boring - overwritten - should be cut in half. I was going to read Short's book on Mao but after this mess, no way. Short should read David McCullough on how to write a historical biography."
3,Lamp of the Century? NO!,"Well, I rec. this lamp as a shower present and though it matches our bedding and is very cute, I am not entirely pleased. The lamp part seems fine, sturdy enough and plenty of light, I like the lamp or nightlight feature. However, I am not crazy about the lampshade. Very flimsy. As I was removing it from the box, I realize it is paper and it bends as I am trying to place it on the lamp. The shade now has several creases in it. Though I do like the lamp, I think the shade may have to be replaced before long."
4,pretty good product,"The shade IS Definitely flimsy, but so far it hasn't needed to be replaced. I like that it can be used as a night light or a regular lamp. (it saves me from occupying another outlet for a nightlight.)"
2,Not worth it at all,"This is actually a pretty worthless EP. I will have to admit that I thought the song ""From the Cradle to Enslave"" was awesome and I convinced myself I needed to own it. I wish I would have just saved the money and bought the MP3 of the song. Don't waste your money on this, it is really bad."
2,Really not worth it,"To be honest, I don't really listen to this EP very much; mainly because I only enjoyed one song on here, the title track. It has a decent music video, if you can find it, but I would recommend see the uncut version, because a lot was edited out. Anyways, I was really disappointed with how the remix of Funeral in Carpathia sound. It is nowhere near as dark sounding as the original on the album ""Dusk and Her Embrace."" The big difference is that Dani doesn't scream on this version like in the original. Some may like it this way, but I feel that it added more atmosphere.Besides the title track, Sleepless is the only other song that was decent. The rest is just not that great..."
1,Blows,Just like the rest of these morons releases.Why anyone likes this mindless noise boggles my mind.
3,Lensbaby for Nikon,"This is more fun than technically useful. The fine tuning takes a lot of work to arrive at a commercially usable product. I had fun taking flower closeups and baby face closeups. It is an expensive toy, in my opinion."
2,An immature Simenon,If one is used to and captivated by Simenon and especially his psychological thrillers this immature work though extremely popular in its day will be diappointing. On the other hand there is so much Simenon out there it is also a poor introduction to the later master and might prevent one from delving deeper or further.
2,Not really Japanese,I had a lot of expectations on this guitar but it is not that good. The sound is not clear or warm and it seems to me that it is because it is actually made in China and not in Japan.
1,Not good in any ways at all,This is a meaningless documentary (?) that should be avoided by any means.There is nothing new.There is nothing shocking.There is not much relevance to it at all.
5,Die Form's Best!,"Die Form's other CDs are all fascinating, moody, artistic, sexually charged -- but somewhat repetitious. Provided that both ""Vicious Circles"" and ""Histories I/II"" are ""best of"" compilations, it is to be expected that the themes from their individual albums would all mesh into cohesive wholes. But ""Confessions"" stands out -- not as eerie, just as charged, but with a danceablity and a rhythm that is missing from so many of their other discs. This isn't the music to seduce by -- it is the one to make you throw back your ragtop and cruise down the highway with the speakers cranked and the wind in your hair. The beat, the charge, the artistry...unbelievable! This is Die Form's most accessible, breathless work. Buy it -- then try to catch your breath!"
4,Insanity,"Rehasher defines themselves as a super-fast punk band, which there aren't to many of anymore. Don't expect this to sound like the millions of other punk bands. There sound is fast and incredibly addictive. If you like Less Than Jake, you might like this band only because Less Than Jake has a more polished sound, were as Rehasher's sound is insanity in musical form. If you like to listen to fast music, This cd is for you"
3,stop and read,"if you DID'T watch the first 48 episodes of this series this is for you, this is the second set for the first 48 episodes, you got a fist set with 6 discs, and a second set with 6 disc, which this is."
4,Revelation,"I am enjoying this story enough to read it slow. With the tales I recall Mr. Penhallow telling us in class, and this story, I feel like I know ""Percy"" all the better. This story shows the essence of growing up different and alone. Plus I too am a Mayo Affectionato.I look forward to finishing the book."
1,don't buy this,This lasted about two months before it ceased to take or hold a charge. Buy one made by Palm.
5,Always trust a Taunton Book!!!,"If you are the least bit interested in constructing your own lingerie, don't waste your time on any other book, this book is the best!!Don't bother with books about nylon tricot. This book tells you about all of your fabric options. There is even information on using bed sheets!While other books stop at camisoles and half slips, Sewing Lingeries that Fits covers the mysterious subject of bra fitting and construction.And if you are into frou-frou and embellishments, there is even a section for you covering dyeing, beading, embroidery, etc.This book has lots of photos and lots of information crammed into it's 144 pages.GET THIS BOOK!!"
1,Junk,"My in-laws have this phone. The sound is full of static, even standing next to the base when on the phone. It also knocks the computers in the house off of the wireless router every time it rings. This undesired effect seems to come and go, regardless of channel."
2,cover won't last but a few days...,"Great original idea, perfect size for starts...however the cover and zipper rips apart immediately and a light wind will tear the cover to shreds quickly....lasted me maybe 2 months.... would love to have given this a better review if they would only make the cover higher quality....Then....you can't find a replacement cover that is heavy duty...so I'll just have to make my own"
3,Top Quality at Rock Bottom Prices,"Great product at the cheapest price I've found anywhere, and I mean ANYWHERE! Friendly and fast service. The seller even sent a little bonus gift. A+ customer service!"
5,Best Pencil I've Ever USed,"These are by far the best and most comfortable pencil's I've ever used. I purchased them mainly for drawing and sketching, but after a while I've noticed I use it for damn near everything.. switching back to wooden pencils or pens make my holding fingers hurt cause they're so hard to grip comfortable. The Eraser last for a long time, I usually loose my pencil before I get to finishing an eraser.. And i REALLY like the long needle nose tip, makes it very easy to see where you drawing. Well designed pencil it's the only one I use.PS. They make a similar version called the Side-FX, don't bother with it, it's no where near as comfortable and feels cheaper.."
4,Great Book!,"This is a great book. The text is entertaining, but also heartwrenching as well due to the fact that CF worked so very hard at their craft, but did not receive the recognition and praise that they so deserved. Tom describes in great detail the ups and downs of trying to keep the band together while trying to increase the band's exposure and success. CF worked unbelievably hard on their music. Because CF's music was unique in that it was heavy, but also had so much more in terms of emotion, thought and purpose, it will forever be one of my favorite metal bands.I highly recommend this book to anyone who was or is into metal. I now have a greater appreciation for all of the time, effort and sacrifice that CF put into their work. The text is well-balanced. Tom relates many funny and crazy incidents that go along with being on the road, but also provides a detailed account of the band's history and development."
1,Junk blender-avoiiiiiid- Manufacturing DEFECT on the blade assembly,"The blade assembly of this blender has manufacturing defect. After sometime of usage, it will start jamming up and you will need to buy another blade assembly. I have personally replaced about 4 blades to learn the hard way that the blender has this manufacturing defect. If you don't trust me, try it for yourself and you will surely regret buying this blender."
2,"cute, in a teeny tiny sort of way...","The metal tin itself is 1 1/2"" X 2"" X 2 1/4"", and each piece of ""toast"" is 1 1/2"" X 1 1/4"".Very, very small! It's cute, and the wooden pieces are likely to last a long time as long as they aren't lost. But, were I to have seen this item in a store, I would not have paid what I did for so little."
3,excellent choice,this is a great collection of 2 games one is lacking in the adventure department you basically have a map and move from dot to dot but both have fantastic stories and battle systems. sense of justice has many differant and unique endings where the other is essentialy the same ending only involving differant characters. there are 3 uniquely differant endings to it that i know of still both have lots of replay value. my favorite thing in sense of justice is that if you are a great player and respond correctly to in certain situations you can actualy play the story as the bad guys. the down side to that is it cuts off alot of game time compared to the normal story but it is considerably more diificult. all in all its a great choice for any rpg fan you will in awe over the revolutionary battle system never seen anything quite like it. its more of a turn based rts in battle youll have to see it
4,"At last, an old school rpg!","This is the latest game released by Working Designs. As usual, we have been waiting too long because they delayed, delayed and delayed again. But here it is, and because you waited for so long, you get 2 games for a very low price. This package includes Growlanser 2:The Sense Of Justice(1999) and Growlanser 3: The Dual Darkness (2002). Both games are lasting about 40 hours each, with a total of nearly 10 hours of voice acting. The voice acting is very good, no lame performances! For those of you who are tired of high-tech rpgs like Final Fantasy games, random dungeons and 3-d stuff, then this game is for you! This is an old school rpg for hardcore fans. Caracters are Sailor-Moonish like, every one of the major caracters have their own voice. The game plays close to Final Fantasy Tactics, but better in my opinion."
2,"Affordable wireless, but........","Very affordable product, and I found it incredibly reliable under Win 95/98...but alas, not support for NT...or worse yet, no support for Win 2000"
5,A Beautiful Ride on the Most Uplifting Railway Ride,"This book is a magnificent night time story for young and old. A celebration of babies and sweetness beyond compare. Each baby pictured is sweeter than the the one before. Particularly perfect for adopted children, as the storyline features and pictures babies of every color, shape and size. The ultimate destination for these sweethearts is the arms of a loving family. My grandchildren squeal to have someone read this family celebration of love. It's my favorite children's bedtime story. Can't recommend it enough."
4,Excellent book for a Linux Newbie,"No doubt, Linux can be intimidating for new users and this book does an excellent job of providing the basics without a lot of the technical jargon that usually accompanies most Linux texts. If you're a total newbie, then this book is a very good place to start. The text is divided into four sections:1.)Installing2.)Connecting to the internet3.)Using various applications to to perform basic file maintenance tasks, use Open Office, and listen to and burn Cds.4.)Understanding the Linux file system and basic networking.The downside is the CDs that are included - give them a miss. Rather than fiddle around with them, purchase the Red Hat 8 personal box set (also available through Amazon) which includes a detailed installation guide and 30 days of support/help for the product."
2,very inadequate,"first of all, this might help you get started with redhat 8.0 and a handful of the popular application packages that come with it, but i haven't found it very helpful at all in increasing my understanding of the linux os. you will get the BARE minimum and for the same price, you might buy the redhat boxed set and get a user manual that might not be as friendly to read, but certainly more helpful. the author doesn't even explain how to mount firewire drives, claiming that most harddrives today are ide or scsi. come on! spend the extray ...and get the redhat bible instead."
5,VROOM- ZOOM!! GOOD STUFF! Great photography,"I really liked this movie! My fiance' who used to be involved with racing and I watched it together AND WE BOTH LIKED IT! The photography was really progressive for it's time and pretty neat by today's standards. The story-line is very ""true to life"" with regards to both the love interests and the racing aspects. There was an intermission about half way through; I couldn't wait to get back into it. See it. Watch it if you don't buy it. You won't be sorry."
4,Never mind the actors watch the cars,"Acting? What acting? James Garner and Toshiro Mifune are perfectly fine in this, but the real attraction is the footage of the racing. Frankenheimer's film is, for all intents and purposes, the source for anyone who films car racing for broadcast. If you enjoy car racing at all, watch the film. There is a technical virtuosity that even an exciting film like Le Mans cannot match. Besides, the F1 cars of the period actually required something other than extremely fast synapses and general physical fitness to drive -- and that makes this film probably more entertaining than half the most recent season.If you want a mental challenge, look elsewhere. This is a visual treat, even if you don't care that much about racing."
3,"movie ""Grand Prix","Since I no longer have my VHS copy, comparisons can be difficult. The sound on the DVD is excellent, but the overall color tone is very washed out-the colors are very faded in appearance. I don't like the color quality one bit, but I feel fortunate to be able to watch it at all!"
3,More Sound than Fury,"I'm an amateur racer and lover of all things retro, but I can only like ""Grand Prix"" so much.Sure, the opening sequences and surreal closeups are interesting and exciting, but they wear thin well before the end of even the first tape (a two-tape set) and can't carry the lurching, plodding story line. What starts off as seemingly bold artistic experimentation starts looking more like ""Hawaii Five-0"" trailers as the film progresses (rapid zoom-ins, etc).If you've got to have it, confine yourself to the first 30-45 minutes (through the Monaco GP race). If you don't, you may find your other viewers evaporating faster than race gas on hot concrete."
1,"Very tough to start, unreliable, needs repair quickly","This trimmer was always difficult to start, even when brand new. The pull cord worked fine to begin with but, after minimal use, the cord wouldn't rewind properly and eventually stopped working entirely. We had the item repaired (to the tune of $40), the pull cord worked for one use and then broke again.We gave it one star because, when we could get the darn thing started, it did do a decent job of trimming greenery. It had plenty of power but was much more work than it was worth. We've had it less than 6 months and it is already worthless. Don't buy this item - it is not well made!"
2,Not recommended for runs of any length,"I installed two of these pass-thru plates: one at the wall near the receiver and one in the ceiling near the projector. The in-wall cable is high-quality HDMI and I got no interference running it directly from the receiver to the projector in the wall. After installing the plate, my projector flickers and cuts in and out. I guess I'll just go with a cheap cable pass-thru plate. Blah."
5,A must have for young children,"This is a great animated book series feating the stories of Maurice Sendak. Most folks know Where The Wild Things Are, and this follows the original. My favorite stories are those sung by Carole King, and Pierre in particular. Her voice is so beautiful and she belts everything with such feeling that it's hard to miss the message. In addition to this being one of my children's favorite DVDs, I use it as a teaching aid in a special education classroom. The kids there love it too and it helps with their reading and memorization skills. I would whole-heartedly recommend this DVD to any parent or teacher looking for beautiful stories and music to share with their children"
3,As much as I want to give this a higher rating...,"kids don't like to watch it! Yes it's a ""classic"" but I enjoy it more than the kids. Which really isn't saying much because animated stories are for them."
3,"Much like the previous volumes in series, very interesting","If you've gotten the first two books in Ms. Gibson's series you'll find this book to be very similar in nature. This time she visits the 5th and 6th seasons giving you a picture and quote from each episode and a paragraph about each. You are also informed of the guest cast and writer/directors and several paragraphs about each episode, this is actually the most informative part about each story.I thought the charactor/ actor profiles at the end of this edition were very interesting (some very nice photos too)as were the chapters about various aspects of producing the series. It's a good bok ofr a fan of the series to own but if you're new to StarGate you'll be sort of lost as it assumes you know what's going on."
1,If your primary focus in SG-1 is the Sam Jack Romance...,"...than this author's approach to a 'series companion' is for you. Otherwise, save your money for something that's more comprehensive and balanced, has some good color illustration, leaves out the self-promotion and fawning and doesn't pander to one faction of a very large viewership. Save your money for a better licensee."
4,Plush oriole,"It met my expectations well. My niece was very happy with her Maryland souvenir. And a bonus, it sings! I would recommend this as a cute gift!"
3,OK book - adequate illustrations,"This book introduces the role and garb of an English longbow warrior. The text is merely there to support the illustrations. For 64 pages, you are not going to get a dissertation. Neither are the illustrations that great."
4,Dungen - self-titled (Subliminal Records),"Looks to be Dungen's first out of (I'm guessing) six CD offerings. You get three lengthy tracks to soak in. The four-part ""Stadsvandringar"" (14:49), the six-part ""Midsommarbongen"" (18:34) which I really liked this song number two better than the other couple of compositions and ""Lilla Vaennen"" (11:37). Personnel: Gila Storm - vocals, Gustav Ejstes - guitar, keyboard, flute & vocals, Alex Wiig - sitar, Marco Lohikari - bass, Linus Gustafsson - saxophone and Fredrik Bjorling - drums. Obviously, real major progressive fans would likely get more out of this CD than I did."
1,check Walmart first!,"After buying this door handle, I saw the exact same item at Walmart for cheaper. They actually had quite a variety of locking knows thast were more attractive and half of the price. I could have avoided shipping cost then too. It was also hard to install and make properly aligned to were a knob had been previously."
3,So So,"No good, not bad. I wanted it to be nicer, higher quality. I would buy it again, just wanted much more for my money. The reason I purchased it was to hide the screws for a designer look, it does that well. I just was looking for thicker and more substantial construction. It is fine, I just wanted more. I would recommend this product."
2,letdown,"beware the enthusiasm regarding this cd marah means well i am sure however the easygoing attitude does not quite cover up their ambition and willingness to acheive it, its ironic they name the new album kids in philly, upon release of it they fired the two kids FROM philly along with long standing management i guess kids from the suburbs didnt have that edge they were looking for yes they do some dead on shots of people whove gone before them i recomend getting the real deals tho, springsteen stones and steve forbert maybe with some aging they'll have real things to talk about and not made up attitudes and stories, i e the song about vietnam, thats really stretching it isnt it? it's like hearing steve earle sing about monagamy or stock investment it just doesnt ring true, talented guys but not all theyre blown up to be, someday they'll shuck off the disguise of who they wish they were for maybe who they really are just an average collection of beer fueled rock i think"
1,Hype anyone?,"Don't believe the hype! This album is bad! First time I heard it, I thought it was a spoof on something, maybe a Weird-Al type album. But no! These dudes are supposed to be real!Marah's sound on this CD is similar to what would be produced by a bunch of embarrassingly drunk frat boys on ''open-mic night'' at the local sports bar. No innovation, no emotion, silly self-important vocals, and it certainly doesn't rock enough to be called ''rock-n-roll''. I've lived in Philly for 18 years, and, trust me, Marah does NOT represent my city musically, nor even literally - many Philly references on this album, names, places, etc, are completely fictional. Save your money, and be wary of corporate hype!"
5,One of the most UNDERATED singers!!!!!!,"Toni Lee Scott...ahh!!! The purity of her voice, timing and phrasing, is unparalleld by any other singer, other than Ella. As I have known Toni, since she was the singer with the Bob Scobey Band in the late '50's, am amazed that she consistently improves. Her version of ""Ten Cents A Dance,"" is the BEST version that I have EVER heard. Yes, even much better than Ruth Etting's recording of this wonderful song. Am so glad that Toni utilized the purity of a wonderful small group, as opposed to, a big band, which would have been a hinderance to her. In my book, Toni, has always been one of the greats!!!!!"
4,hitachi nail guns,The nail guns were received promptly and they are a pleasure to use but in the discription a hex tool was suppose to be included with each gun and none were received.
2,I've seeen better nailers,"OK This is a fairly nice nail gun. Nothing miraculous about making a decent finish nailer. First problem with this nailer is it comes in two firing modes, both of which are dangerous as h__l. If you can still walk around and inadvertently shoot someone if you have the trigger depressed, to me, that's dangerous. OK for pros in some settings. To switch to ""full sequential actuation"" will cost you $60 plus shipping. Seems like that should be the default configuration and then switch to rapid fire modes if you like.The air nozzle is more gimmick than anything, fairly irritating when you hit the button by mistake. You're better of with a $5 spray nozzle."
5,right color,These are absolutely the right color red....NOT and orange red but a deep candy apple red....cute. I absolutely love them! :-)
2,SoHo is So-So,"An attractive set, but very thin, EASILY breakable glass. I'm down to 5 glasses & no bowl. Also, the glasses are irregular-they're all different sizes. bleh."
2,Retitled as: Yaloms Commentary on the History of the Wife,"I was rather dissapointed in this book, since it is not a scholarly account of the history of the wife, but rather Yaloms Commentary on the History of the Wife.Constantly, instead of demonstrating how wives have been treated, she tells us ""they were treated terribly."" As interesting as that is, she does not seem to give facts to support her conclusion. I didn't intend to buy a book of conclusions.Note, I stopped reading in the middle of the 2nd chapter, I was so irritated. Does it get better? Maybe, but I simply don't trust the author after the section I did read.-Stephen"
5,Invaluable Information,"I have been an avid enthusiast of using natural supplements over prescription drugs whenever possible. I have read many books on this topic but this is truly one of the best. It covers a wide variety of topics from Fibrocystic Breast Disease, Varicose Veins, PMS, Menopause and beyond. In my quest to beat Breast Cancer, I found the information on natural supplements invaluable. Although written by a doctor, it is very easy to read."
5,finally someone with a right mind,this book is great! covers allot of topics not usually intended for the masses. its about time the masses found out they are living a lie!
5,fantastic,"This is an awesome book. Not only full of interesting information but spiritually wise and inspiring. Offers a new vision for the future of humanity... Smart, wity and uplifting. A brilliant read..."
4,Felt just a little bit cheated,"This is the kind of book that could have done with more water. Divided into Baby and Bathwater (as in ""Don't Throw The Baby Out WIth The Bathwater""), the Bathwater could have been deeper. A lot deeper. Before examining the Baby (Gnosticism) in the second half, I could have done with a lot more bathwater. To help convince the millions of people out there that the religion they hold so much stock in is sheer madness, there should have been more madness to show them. Of course, then the book would have run as long as one of Stephen King's and been twice as scary, but there you go. I wanted more, and I felt the book needed more. There's just the slightest sense of not expending as much effort as they might have. For this 4 stars. Five stars, though, for the intention."
5,Wife loved it!!,"Boy, she was surprised!! A beautiful watch, many compliments from her coworkers. Lots oooohhhss and aaaahhhsss!"
5,Bulova Watch,"I bought this watch for myself, my birthday and Mother's Day are within the same week so I bought this with my birthday money I had received. I love the watch, it is absolutely beautiful!! Very elegant and classy looking. When I read all the reviews I trusted everyone's comments and I'm so glad I did. I am very happy with it. I have a very small wrist and took it to have it sized, they removed 2 links from both sides and it fits perfectly."
3,Misleading Title,"While intersting, this book is not really geared to persons of average means. The author gives example upon example of individuals who live in NYC part of the year, but enjoy long sojourns to their other homes in rural PA, upstste NY, the Berkshires etc. Hardly the average retiree!"
4,"Good workout, but not my favorite by Emily Welsh","This workout is hard to follow the first time or two you do it. Emily Welsh, who is normally really good at cueing, introduces new moves without enough notice and it's hard to keep up initially. However, it is definitely a good workout once you've done it enough times to remember what moves come next."
5,"Sweet, romantic and sexy, thanks to the goddess with chicken feet","Every full moon, the goddess Lilith, she of the sumptuous body, black wings and chicken feet, descends to earth. Initially, she was drawn to Jack to help him recover from the loss of the woman he loved. But when Jack's friends become concerned by his peculiar behavior (getting naked in the full moonlight, to begin with), Lilith can't resist ""helping"" them with their own love lives. What ensues is sweet and sexy, romantic and hilarious. I can't believe I waited this long to read it!"
2,Not the same as the stick,"I bought this product based on the reviews I read that it was better than the stick version. I was disappointed and now I have 23 tubes of this! It goes on more ""wet"" than the stick which I don't like. I feel like it doesn't absorb into my lips the way the stick does and feel like I have to re-apply more often than the stick. I guess I'll give them out to people and see what they think but for me - I'm going back to the stick version."
3,Another kids love it - Parents hate it video,This is the one DVD our 2.5 year old watches that we cannot stomach at all. The character and the songs to memorize # of sides in different polygons is awful. Perhaps he is learning and he certainly is mesmorized by it but is it worth it?
4,Heart-wrenching Documentary,"I had read quotes from critics who said this ""drama"" [my quotes] was a regrettable adaptation of historic events by amateur film-makers who had slapped together a potentially fine story, with poor editing, music, and technical support. While my wife and I did find some technical rough spots, we soon realized that we were watching a true documentary with here and there a dramatization that made the events more comprehensible. We were amazed at learning the details of a history which we had only vaguely known about. Many of our previous miscopnceptions were set straight, and by the end of the film we found ourselves profoundly moved. A must-see film for Jews (even non-practicing ones like ourselves), and recommended for all others with an interest in human history."
2,"What Happened to these ""Rising Rebels""?","If you loved 7L & Esoteric's old stuff, do not pick up this album. It sounds completely different than ""Dangerous Connections"" or DC2. The beats are much heavier and not catchy what so ever. It's not music you can knod your head to, its music you want to sit in a dark room and cut yourself to. It's very ""pop"" sounding and and Esoteric doesn't bring any fire in his lyrics. What happened to piano beat tracks like ""Rise of the Rebel"" and ""Battlefield"". I don't no what this CD is, but it's not the 7L & Esoteric I know and love. This isn't ""A New Dope"" it's ""A New Nope""."
5,Singin' shake whatcha mama gave ya to a thug,"While this album is obviously not for everyone, it is an AMAZING album. It to me was paying homage to what hip hop once was. Now alot of these kids out here who did not grow up listening to old school hip hop(not like when you hear a 16 year old call Dre's ""The Chronic"" old school) will probably have little respect for an album like this. 7L's beats are always catchy and there is no exception with this album and ESO's flow is non-stop throughout. Great samples too, 7L even samples the Twin Peaks theme on Perfect Person."
1,"US STEALING THEIR Money, I think NOT!","All of the singers are withcing out because we trade music, I have well over one hundred of Kenny Rogers CD's and DVDs, but, as on this one, we only get the same ole regurgitated songs with MAYBE one or two new ones, on this one he didn't even give us one new one.I would say the Singers and Record Companies are the thief's.Im'm 58, and durn well will stop buying ALL music if they don't back off and give us something for the reruns we do buy or trade!"
1,too simplistic for subject matter,"Chick lit is really ruining the book publishing industry. Ms. Berg has usually been able to rise to the top of the genre, giving in-depth presentations that were wise and complex, but with this book she joins the ranks of the paperback mentality of chick lit. Scratch the surface, have someone die, have someone in therapy reliving the sins of childhood. Yikes. Avoid it if you want a good deep read. If you're reading on the bus and just want a movie-of-the-week rendition of a complex issue, by all means, have this twinkie."
2,"Not her best book, by far","I like Elizabeth Berg's novels. Usually, they are emotionally right on target. This one, however, is off base. She's writing about deep issues between a daughter and the mother who abused her. As a psychotherapist I think Berg has over-simplified the issues; and, as a result, the whole book felt flimsy to me.The end seemed unoriginal, and unreal. It didn't fit with all the prior emotional intensity. It was almost as if Berg got tired of the book and decided to wrap things up in a bow.If this had been my first book by Berg I would not read another."
3,"I still love Berg, anyhow","""The Art of Mending"" did not have the same passion Berg usually gives to her books, not the same ""Yea, I get it! I've been there. I understand.""Acually, it is the first book (and I've read all of them) that Berg does not give completely of herself, or at least I felt this.But...even so, I absolutely still love her, still read every page, still enjoyed it.Two sisters coming to terms with abuse in the family...one would think we would blame the mother, but Berg does not turn her into a monster--- instead gives her a face, a history, even a tender soul.Berg's gift is making the reader see through the eyes of somebody we may hate under normal circumstances, but she turns everything around, helps us understand why they did what they did....shows us their sins and weaknesses and we forgive them, we must, in the end.In the last 3 or 4 chapters...Berg is back to her insightful, delicious self...and this is why i give the book 3 and a half stars."
3,Give this book a chance,"I think other reviewers are unnecessarily harsh in their reviews of this book. One of my definitions of a good book is one that makes me think. A quote: ""As for mending, I think it's good to take the time to fix something rather than throw it away. It's an antidote to wastefulness and to the need for immediate gratification. You get to see a whole process through, beginning to end, nothing abstract about it. You'll always notice the fabric scar, of course, but there's an art to mending: If you're careful, the repair can actually add to the beauty of the thing, because it is testimony to its worth."" (14) This book is about a family's decision whether or not to repair (mend) their relationships after there has been a great tear through the fabric of their lives. It makes you think about whether there are relationships in your life that need mending."
2,Unfinished Seams,"The Art of Mending is the first book I have read by Elizabeth Berg. The subject of child abuse among family members demands more fully drawn characters with greater depth. This book is too much of a skeletal rough draft for this subject. As a reader I often felt like I was viewing a Child Abuse 101 tape rather than experiencing the painful exploration of this family's problems. Lois Battle, in Bed and Breakfast, creates believable characters who struggle to be a family. I grew to love those characters through Battle's gentle humor and deep understanding."
1,"The series is great, don't get me wrong.","But this book...it just....how should I put it, sucked! The plot was poor, the ending unbelievable, even for a Replica book. Please don't misunderstand me, I love the Replica books, just not this one. Don't waste your money folks."
1,yeek!!!!!!,"now, I'm not the kind of person that is this mean, but i just had to say: HOW UNREALISTIC CAN YOU GET? after allll those totally great books that marilyn kaye wrote for this series, this is just too bad. really. i loved it so much when the books were realistic. ah, the good old days.. *wistful sigh*but anyway, this really disappointed me. think about it: everything seemed pretty realistic up until about the 19th book, ""dreamcrusher,"" when amy started getting premonitions and reading minds because she was struck by a lightning bolt. now, in this final book, amy gets the ability to FLY (yes, you read that right) because of a genetics company run by the 10-year-old evil genius kid, adrian peele, who first appeared in the 7th book, ""the best of the best."" that was just messed-up. i'm sorry. i was hoping for something halfway believable, but no.. *sigh* i guess not.."
3,Meets needs of target audience (Grade 4 - Grade 10),"Polish Americans is part of a set of tapes on Multicultural Peoples of North America. It is about 30 minutes long. There are about 20 minutes of a light touch on the history of Polish people who came to North America (USA only)and a light touch on the living conditions and outstanding Polish Americans. This is quite adequate for the target audience. There is a strong overtone of awareness of the many cultures that go into the making of peoples in North America. The list of groups on the package miss American Indians and the Southeast Asian contributions. Perhaps in the future the coverage will be expanded. The tone of this one tape seems to indicate a trend in this direction. The three star rating has to do with the lack of depth of the material, the long effort to reenforce the need for accomodation and the tape quality. The tape is not high quality and the color control was less than adequate in a number of instances."
3,Ennh...,"As a huge Dream Theater and Marillion fan, a large Flower Kings fan, and a small Spock's Beard fan, I had high hopes for this combo.After several listens, though, I can't join in the love-fest. This is no better and no worse than Spock's Beard, and therefore, given the performers, a waste.I give the opening track 4 stars -- comparable in quality to SB's ""The Light"", let's say, but incomparable to ""Close to the Edge"", no matter what the other reviewers have said (when was the last time they listened to it? 1977?) This is followed by what seem to be two SB and one FK throwaway tracks.The Procol Harum cover at the end redeems it somewhat.I hear their second album is more collaborative, so maybe it's more promising, but then again there's too much else you could listen to."
5,A Masterpiece...,"this album is! That is pretty much what can sum up Transatlantic's debut album. With members from Spock's Beard, Marillion, Dream Theater and The Flower Kings, this is truly a great album. Every single cut on here is jaw-dropping and unique. Dare I say it is worth the price alone for All of the Above? Well, yes, because that probably one of the greatest epics written for a long time, and no, because you would be missing out on all the other great songs, especially ""My New World."" They even manage to pull off the Procul Harum song ""In Held (Twas) In I"" in their own unique way, yet keeping to the spirit of the original song. This is just such a great album, you really have to buy it for yourself to see. Absolutely recommended - must have!"
1,"Plastic, poppy fodder for the 90's boobery age","This book has the distinct feel of the vapid, glossy magazines that ""synergize"" celebrity profiles, ""art"" features and ""profound"" issues as a new form of disposable pop, the marketing of cool. It looks like a pale imitation of Saul Bellow and other classic writers as told to Soho art gallery promotional copy writer. It belongs in the Bret Easton Ellis universe of soulless prefab chic and dumbed down ""essential reads"" for yuppies, New York media types and professional snobs. Beware, and before you buy the hype, check the originals. Invest your money, and specially your time, in Isaac Bashevis Singer."
4,"Two hairdresser stories, two WWII stories, etc.","I first read ""Twenty-seventh Man"" in ""Story"", and thought it amazing. Then I read ""Tumblers"" in ""American Short Fiction"" and thought that amazing too (but somewhat overplodded, not ""overplotted""). Now I've read the whole book. Only two stories fail, in my opinion, but I'll not say which ones. These unsuccessful stories were considerably ""off"" from all the others, which means Englander can write, and when he's on he's fabulously tight and yet idiosyncratic, perhaps intentionally idiosyncratic, but when he's off, he's like most of the rest of us. The off stories just need some more work."
3,Well-written but lacking substance,"""For the Relief of Unbearable Urges"" is written in a brilliant style comparable to ""The Triumph and the Glory"" and has its moments, but it just doesn't seem to go anywhere."
4,Excellent Reasons for Historical Reliability of the Gospels,"The book is an excellent examination of why evangelicals can intelligently understand what it means to view the Gospels as both theological AND historical works. Dr. Blomberg includes discussions on the use of Midrash, form and redaction criticism, and a chapter discussing miracles. I suggest one take notes while reading the book in order to fully comprehend the solutions that Dr. Blomberg offers to many questions that occur in Gospels research. It is not a soft-brained devotional but a toughminded examination for those who are interested."
4,A calling for all environmental advocates . . .,Voice of the Planet is full of information relevant to any human being who is interested in continuing to use the resources of the Earth. The statistical and scientific information opens the readers eyes to the destruction and rape of the natural world. Each fact strikes at the heart of the reader. This book evokes such strong reactions from its reader than anyone reading it will be empowered to join an environmental cause. This book is an enjoyable and worthwhile read.
2,Too negative,"If you are trying to teach your kids not to talk back, this is not a book you want! My grandson's reply right after the first talk back was...""that's not very nice"" , so I finished reading it with my own editing....then threw the book away!"
2,Basic knowledge but no expertise,"It's obvious Kirby has a superficial knowledge of Jujitsu but even as an introductory book, this lacks depth."
1,Sets the wrong example,"I think this book is setting the wrong example. The very first move, they are standing, he whacks the opponent in the sternum (nothing gentle about that) and then proceeds to throw him over his shoulder. So much for the gentle art of self defense. Typical macho idiot (although I probably would not say that to him in a dark alley).For a MUCH better book get the below:http://www.amazon.com/Jiu-Jitsu-Complete-NAKAE/dp/0806504188The book above.. teaches how a tiny lady can take down a humongoid dude with 1 finger.. . now THAT is the gentle art of self defense.Just no comparison."
2,Boring and Predictable,"After reading the reviews and seeing the ratings that this film received, I had high expectations, but it fell flat...way flat. There really isn't anything positive that I have to say regarding this movie. I hated most of the characters and I would have been happy if they had all just died, so this boring movie would have ended sooner. The storyline is original, unfortunately it is also completely predicatable. Also, I watched this movie because I was expecting a horror/suspense film, but there was no terrifying moments and very little suspense. Overall, this film was boring, the characters were flat and unlikable, it was predictable, and a little stupid in my opinion. I would say don't bother watching it, I wish I hadn't."
4,I LOVE THIS FILM. IT IS NOT FOR THE KIDS.,THIS MOVIE VERY ORIGINAL. THE MOVIE IS VERY DISTURBING IN IT'S SUBJECT MANNER. VERY HARD TO WATCH WHAT HAPPEN TO THE GIRL IN THE FILM BUT WELL WORTH THE JOURNEY. THIS MOVIE NOT FOR THE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 16 NOT UNLESS YOU ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH A ZOMBIE-LIKE-DEADGIRL OK. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE IN EVERY HORROR MOVIE BUFF CATALOG. VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD.
4,Worthwhile watching,I saw this on TV before I bought it. This version does not add much more to the TV version.
1,the best waste of my time since Nascar,"Ok, first of all everyone that wrote previous reviews on this little gem have missed a very crucial point. In the beginning they find this girl chained to a gurney inside a room that has been locked for half a century. What would anyone do, serial killers/rapists included? Hmmm, possibly wonder how this girl got inside and is still alive!? Oh no, not the two heroes in this film, not one single question is ever asked about this naked girl. Their immediate response, ""let's DO her!"". They further destroy any semblance of a believable reaction when the two heroes start pimping her out to the jocks at their highschool. Naturally not a single one of them ask the question ""HOW"". They all just immediately start raping her. Really great writers could take some serious lessons from the script of this movie and I mean that in the most sarcastic way possible. This movie should be burned, every copy."
1,Worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!,How the heck could this movie ever get 4 stars??? I can't even believe I sat through the whole movie. It was semi pornographic and disgusting!! Ugh...I want to vomit. What a complete waste of my time!!!
1,Deplorable,"I have watched horror movies almost my whole life (50+ years) and I have never seen one more deplorable than this one. To have teenager boys raping a girl found in a warehouse that was almost dead is inexcusable. What is this telling the teenage boys of our time, that it's okay to do this? How you could you even sell a movie like this?"
5,Found this discontinued item,"I was so happy to find this product, it has been discontinued in the stores. I got a years supply! Was delivered quickly and the price was reasonable for a discontinued product."
2,Interesting Concept,"Interesting concept, bought the entire series, highly derivative. Kept expecting more out of it."
4,Nice purchase for myself,"Great price for these volumes. I have not read any of Conan Doyle's work before, and I am enjoying these stories."
2,This is a very cheapo photo album.,"I just wanted to point out that this is a very cheapo photo album. It is certainly not a bargain at this price. I barely consider the product acceptable at any price. I noticed the other reviewers paid considerably less than I did. I paid $4 and change, and feel ripped off."
3,Disappointed in quality,"I had bought some of the other pioneer brag books which were nice but these ""mini"" books look cheap and are made of plastic."
2,"Great sharpener, but didn't last long.","I loved this sharpener. It performed exactly as the other reviewers described. I am an artist and used it for sharpening expensive color pencils. It did a great job of creating sharp points without eating up the pencils. However, it stopped working after about a year. I don't think I abused or over-used it. I was very disappointed. I think I'm going to purchase the electric model this time; it received a lot of good reviews, and I hope it will last much longer."
3,arrived spilled,"The product is effective, the little that was left in the bottle after the top loosened and it leaded through the box. I was offered no refund or replacement though I reported this earlier."
3,Hemingway was GREAT.........this documentary was NOT.,This documentary was a good introduction to Hemingway's life and writing but left a lot out. I was expecting a more exciting overview of his life than this. I also didn't like the fact that there was a female voice reading from his work.... it almost felt like I was listening to a female author rather than the beloved Papa. I would recommend this DVD only to hardcore Hemingway readers who want everything.
5,Welcome introduction to the sky,"This is a user's manual to the sky. It is very enjoyable reading, and guides you pleasantly through all the important sights of the night sky. Excellent - one of my favourites"
2,Broken,This was a great product for opening boxes and random things..... until it broke 3 weeks after i had it.
1,Don't judge a book by its title?,"A friend bought me this book as a gift after only reading the title. Since I have studied the ""occult"" for many years why not add a dictionary on the subject to my library? Unfortunately this book was written and published by people who are ignorant of the occult and deem anything not Christian to be ""dangerous"". The publisher boasts: ""More than 700 articles describe the beliefs, practices, people and organizations that form a powerful opposition to the Christian faith."" Let the buyer beware! If you wish to promote ignorance, then this book is for you. If you are looking for a non-biased study, don't waste your money. This book does not know how to differentiate between truly dangerous cults which abuse occult symbolism for its own gain from legitimate and benign pagan religions and occult symbolism. Ironically the people who would enjoy this book are the same ones who should be considering just what makes a religion a cult!"
1,horrible,"this is a horrible phone, never get it! the service is very poor, i had an Verizon lg env right next to my phone once and i fading in and out of service and the env had three bars. also, i've had to get a new one due to keyboard problems (not registering the keys when texting) and lighting of the keyboard has issues too. also the battery quality is very very poor, it lasts less than a day. even when next texting or calling when texting a lot, battery goes dead in about 15 hours. ALSO the camera is not that great. overall phone, never get samsung, ALWAYS GET LG! GET THE ENV! Also, for this review i was forced to put how many stars, so i was forced to pick 1, if it was my choice i would have picked 0 or a negative number."
3,quetion of this highlighter,"Does ""spring-action chisel tip"" mean to knock a head of this highlighter to push out marker-part to mark or highlight?"
2,Wake me up when the dragon comes on stage and devours the band.,"I try not be too harsh when reviewing stuff, but in the case of this album it would be difficult for me to give it anything higher than 2 stars. Luckily I got this CD for a ridiculously low price so I can just tell myself I got what I paid for.The songs aren't very original - they don't tend to go anywhere exciting, and the production is also very flat which doesn't help matters. I won't even get started on the slower, ballad tracks. I've heard these guys being compared to Stratovarius which I think is the equivalent of stepping on Stratovarius' nuts and spitting in their beer. There, I said it.There is a glint of hope on this album that these guys might have what it takes to differentiate themselves in the future and possibly even build on some of their less crappy qualities. But considering how much their other CDs cost, I'm certainly not taking that risk."
5,Seaview,"As a long time Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea fan, I'm very pleased with the availability of this product and hope that other fans will enjoy it equally."
4,Pros and Cons,Pros:1. A good amount of characters to choose from.2. The story mode is pretty long.3. Plenty of mini games.4. The combat is pretty much the same as Budokai 3 except a few things are missing.5. You can customize the power of your character.Cons:1. They replaced the versus mode with arcade mode so you have no control over which characters you fight.2. Loading screens take forever it seems.3. Their is no shortcut from the main menu to let you customize your characters (you have to go into training mode and go through all the loading and other stuff).Overall it was a great game to buy for the PSP the graphics are a little crappy but you cant really expect much from a hand held game. Half the time you don't really recognize the graphics because you are just trying to win the battle you are in. So if you are looking for a great fighting game at a cheap price than this is the game you want to buy.
5,Great Step By Step Handbook for Change,"For anyone who wants an uncomplicated, step-by-step guide to managing change in an organization, this is as good as anything Peter Senge has written. There are many books and publications about how to foster change initiatives. This one turns theory into common sense action. I was able to attend a seminar with my staff four years ago with Ken Miller. We received the book as part of the program. The experience gave us a common language and platform to move forward with a change we were charged with making happen. The book has been an invaluable resource since then. In fact, several people have borrowed my copy so often that I gave it to the most frequent borrower with the understanding that I could use it when I needed to."
4,Used this book for Nursing course in human development,Great texkbook. Easy to read and understand. Excellent information
4,No facts about Jesus are mentioned,"Although the research into the mystery religions that led to Christianity is excellent, it is missing facts about Jesus. If Jesus was a historical figure, no one outside the Bible mentioned him, and the Bible, as we all know, is a lot of myths, many of which are reworked area stories adopted to Jewish culture. I would like to see the book without references to Jesus as a real person, then it'll be truly nonfictional."
3,"Rugged, Sharpens quickly BUT Off-center point","Very nice heavy duty feel - quite rugged, Sharpens very quickly, better than most electric sharpeners AND takes different diameter pencils.BUT, sharpens to an off-center point. That was a very significant disappointment in an otherwise super product.Some pencils sharpen to an unusable state as the point is so off-center. Kids who tend to not keep the pencil perpendicular to the sharpener when inserting the pencil may have a hard time getting a usable point.What a contrast between how rugged it is and how great the sharpening heads are generally with how the pencil actually gets sharpened.I would bet some of these will sharpen off center like mine does & some not - it's a manufacturing consistency issue I would guess."
4,Very sturdy would recommend,"Bought this one because my kids have managed to destroy every other pencil sharpener we have ever bought for them, this one is now going on about 2 or 3 months and is still going strong (that is a major accomplishment when it comes to my kids and these things) it is made of metal all the way around, the only part I would say could be a little stronger (but it has held up to my kids so far though) is the pencil size adjuster (silver thing on the side) that part feels a little flimsy but the rest of the sharpener is very sturdy, the shavings catcher closes and latches just fine, but to keep my youngest (1 1/2 years old) out of it I just put a piece of electrical tape on it (you don't see it blends just fine) and it looks just fine and he can't get into it any longer.. overall I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again if I was in the market..."
1,A total ripoff,This pencil sharpener does not have the proper mechanism inside to sharpen any kind of pencil. It is a total waste and only fit for the garbage. Your product should be evaluated before being offered for sale.
3,Somehow disappointed - Tip off centered - Rotating arm axis loosely centered,"I was expecting to receive something similar to the made-in-usa or made-in-germany sturdy sharpeners I had used in college library 25 years ago and I am little disappointed. Made in China... X-Acto blades are OK but overall construction of this item is somehow disappointing. After sharpening, pencil tip is off centered. Centering of the arm and blade axis are loose. It is not a precision machine. While rotating the arm, you can hear mechanical noise of the shaking parts, parts that have not to shake but shake and touch each other due to loose parts manufacturing. I am now looking into Swordfish Professional Three Point Option Manual Pencil Sharpener or Johann Faber Manual Sharpeners. Sorry X-Acto, I do not know how many people thinking like me are still around but I could pay you twice for a very sturdy mechanical sharpener made in USA or Germany."
2,Kind of functional,"I was excited about buying an old-fashioned pencil sharpener for my homeschooled son, but this one isn't particularly satisfactory. The action is kind of stiff, and it kind of SCRAPES as it sharpens."
