2,Disappointed,"As with the other Gabaldon fans, I could not wait to get her latest book. I had re-read the others in preparation, and boy was I disappointed! Diapers and breastfeeding--page after page after page! I enjoyed her writing style--as always, and I like all the characters, so it was nice to visit them again. But, I just don't see the point of this novel. I truly hope the editing improves, or I will have to say good-bye to Diana. I've seen this problem with other authors--at some point the editors just stop doing their job, resting on the laurels of a ""sure bet bestseller"". What a shame!"
4,Loved it!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It held my interest just like all the previous ones. I know some people thought it dull and boring until the last 150 pages, but if you care about Bree and Roger as well as Jamie and Claire then you want to know what happens to them and will they be able to get back. I enjoyed this book very much. I can't wait for King,farewell."
2,Too much boring detail,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed all of other books in the series (I read them in order), I literally suffered through this one because of all the boring, rambling details. Hopefully, A Breath of Snow and Ashes will be better."
4,The Adventure Slows,"I have read the four previous books and enjoyed them. When this book was published, I bought a copy right away and began reading. I thought the pace was too slow in the first three hundred pages because it dealt primarily with family living. A friend called after the first 300 pages and said she was disappointed. I told her to give it a chance as the excitement picks up in the next 600 pages. The story does come together, in surprising ways. Diana's sixth book is the last in the series and she has set the stage for it. Will Jamie and Claire return to Scotland? Will Brianna, Roger and Jemmy return through the rings? Will Jamie or Roger be successful in killing Stephen Bonnet and win the revenge they so desperately seek?Yes, the pace is slower and the book is not as good as the previous four are, but loose ends needed to be tied together and they are. I eagerly await book six."
2,I second -wait for the paperback,"All good things must end. This book was slow. Characters lacked the humor, warmth & adventure of the first 4 books. Historical background was scarce, intrigue was almost nil. Development of entire plot lacked and the hook for the next one at the end was really lacking. Why did Ian return? Perhaps Ian and his Indian life should be a new focus for the author. I couldn't put the first 4 in the series down. This was hard to pick back up once put down.All they did was slog up and down Fraser's Ridge, speak endearments in Gaelic, change baby diapers and slog up and down the Ridge again. No mystery, no adventure, really no romance."
1,Boring,Hate to say it. Except for about 200 pages NOTHING happened. Loved the other books. Hope the next installment is better!
3,CULTURE OF HONOR,"Frankly, although the title implies this is a book for the reader interested in history and sociology, it is really a book with academic tone, one that might serve for a masters or Phd thesis. It just doesn't flow like a good trade book by James McPherson (a wonderful historian on the Civil War) or Richard Dawkins (an expert on the sciences of biology and evolution) or Oliver Sacks (an expert on psychology and neurology.) These writers-- even one on the history of men in combat-- consider their audience. So apparently did the author of this book, and it appears the audience is not the reader of trade books. Simply put. I do not fault either the writer or the book. It just isn't what I thought it would be."
2,ten worst presidents,It is unfortunate that the author did not wait until 2011 to write this book. I would be curious to know his take on the current administration.
2,Didn't Need,"Ordered these to use with the ""Stack-On DSR-22 Plastic Drawer Parts Storage Organizer Cabinet, Red."" That cabinet was so small I didn't need any dividers. Kept them so that when I give the cabinet away someone else can use them."
1,Not as great as I expected,"I bought this toy because it earned great awards for fun, but my son doesn't show much interest in it. He's 9 months old, and has had the toy for about 3 months. He does play with it for a few minutes, but usually turns quickly to another toy. He also pulls it out of the base very easily, so the base is worthless in my opinion."
3,Too Top Heavy,"I am less than enthusiastic about this particular rattle. My main complaints are 1) The toy is too heavy, which makes it difficult for small hands to manipulate 2) This heaviness also makes it comes out of its base too easily 3)he suction cup is useless, so basically you are stuck with just a heavy, bulky rattle.I know that most everyone raves about how innovative and educational Sassy rattles and toys are, and I own several of them. However, I must confess that I find most of these toys over-rated and find myself using my older second-hand rattles more frequently because they are lighter and easier for babies to handle.Also, if you own a few Sassy toys, then you own them all because they are quite similar in look and feel. Of all my Sassy toys, I'd say our Smiley-face rattle has gotten the most use and this toy has gotten the least."
2,Standard Sandra,Sandra Bullock proves once again that her acting ability is very limited in a roll written for the hopeless romantic. Bill Pullman is as wooden as ever. Would not reccomend the film unless you're into completely improbable romantic films.
1,While You Were Sleeping,"This is one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it. And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people!"
4,: ),"This is a really good movie. I had seen on T.V. once, maybe about 1 or 2 years ago. I had seen it again with my cousin and it was nice to see! Elsie,the grandma in the movie was funny; Sandra Bullock was great for Lucy!"
5,While You Were Sleeping,"Lucy is a happy-go-lucky ticket seller, until one day she finds the man of her dreams and also sees him get mugged. After being mugged the man, known as Peter, goes into a coma. Lucy goes to visit him at the hospital and the nurse tells Peter's family that Lucy is his fiancÃ©e'. Lucy can not get the courage to tell them the truth and his family take her in as a member of their family. While with this family Lucy falls head over heels in love with Peter's brother, Jack. Lucy does not know what to do when Peter comes out of a coma and doesn't remember her. A great romantic comedy that is so pure and well-made that it is near impossible to say anything negative about it. It is not a perfect movie, but it is a very likeable movie that delivers what it promises. Sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy."
3,Trapped by your Phobia,"Young Penny portrayed by Rachel Miner goes on a retreat with her psychologist portrayed by Mimi Rogers. The psychologist plans a trip with the intention to help Penny overcome her phobia, an intense fear of cars. Unexpected events find her in a nightmarish situation where her worst fears come true, as she allows her fears paralyze her. It is an O.K. story of suspense and horror with some blood thrown in."
3,the how to's of pub ownership,"This is not a great book because I think there's too much info here about very tedious things, but its myu opinion and if you the reader want a very detailed inclusive type of book then this is a higher rated guide book for you."
3,Not good even for a corvette fan.,This is not a very good game. Corvettes r one of my favorite cars so i bought this game for five bucks. So i knew it was not going to be very good. The graphics r not good at all and the background is just as the cars. The controls r horrible because the car either spins out or does not turn that good. It is very hard too so i could not even get halfway through the game so i used cheat codes to unlock all cars and i still could not beat it. Now the only reason i keep it is to look at all of the corvettes from the begining. It would be better if the graphics were better and it was not as hard.
1,bad graphics,this just had bad graphics and wasnt a good game at all i only bought it because the price was so low and i like chevy cars...
2,Very Disappointing!,"First of all, thank God that I didn't buy this game before borrowing it from two of my friends, because I was very disappointed in this game. And, of course, like every videogame out there, this game DID have some good parts to it, but, of course, it had some bad parts to it.Pros> pretty good graphics> great cars> great tracksCons> on PS2, you have to press X really hard to get to your top speed> racing gets boring after a couple of races> in multiplayer mode, Player 2 has to race using first person view(which is really stupid!)> the car handling stinks> the menu music can get annoyingIf you want to buy a good racing game, don't buy this game. You should buy NFSU or any other NFS game. Heck, you could buy Ford Racing 2, that's just as good. I recommend that you rent this game before buying it. If you like it, hey, that's your opinion."
5,What is History?,"Quite provactive, and quite interesting. Allows one to see history in a different light."
4,A Classic Series of Essays,I've read a lot of history but this book reminds me that I haven't read enough books ABOUT history. This is a fascinating collection of essays well worth reading. My copy was in the marvelous Penguin classics series in the very cool orange-banded cover design. At AU$10 these little paperbacks are a real gift to the reading public.
3,Lot of work to be done on it.....,"It was becuase of my curiosity I bought this game and I ended up disappointed .It wasn't really what I expected and its not simulated and its not realistic.The graphics is poor poor poor even in the replays.I am a die hard fan of gran turismo and I couldn't believe I selected to purchase this instead of tourist trophy.Well I learned my lesson and I am going to get tourist trophy now and I am sure I wont be disappointed because even in these reviews you mostly hear the words...realistic,simulation which is what I want.The only good tings I appreciate from the game is the official famous motogp riders being used in the game and their bikes....But other than that it ain't fun atold."
2,A definite lack of wit and humor,"I am currently about half way through this book. It's been a struggle for me to get this far. I wish that I could just put it down, but I can't. Now that I've read half of it, I feel obligated to read the rest.I feel that the author is trying way too hard to be funny. And she's being ""obviously"" funny. Her metephors are too much. Her explanations go on too long. She's too predictable. In many instances, I have been reading and thought to myself, ""I bet she's going to say..."" And you know what? I was right.Maybe I'm being hard on the author and the book because I have been used to the witty and sarcastic writing of authors like Augusten Burroughs and David Sedaris. I guess I shouldn't compare apples to oranges. Laurie Notaro is her own kind of writer and some may find her obvious observations amusing. As for me, I'm not likely to purchase one of her books again."
2,My right shoe... sucks.,"I have bought Vans before without problems, but this particular pair have quality and consistency issues.The left shoe is a perfect fit.The right shoe... crushes my little toe. (Toes are the same size...FYI)I tried breaking it in and after a while...the same..it freakin hurts my right little toe.I am now very leery about buying shoes online. Its one of those things you gotta try on in person, I guess."
5,"Sex, Movies & History-The Best Combo","Cawthorne has done it again with his Goddesses book -- putting out a page turner of hot history which any movie or history buff should read...the amount of research he has done is phenomenal and yet his writing is not stilted or didactic at all. Rather, this book, like his others, is so incredibly entertaining, I can't wait for his next one to come out! (And I hope these books are on reading lists for history classes in school--? What better way to learn?)"
3,Where were the cups?,"Not to be a stickler, but the votive cups this product claims to come with were no where to be found. This product came in a timely manner, but without the cups (or pins to put my own candles on it), I have to shell out even more money. Also, two of the stands on the left side are bent and tilt to the right, making candles sit funny on it."
1,"Bland/Ineffective; Try Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear""","No specific advice here, very bland and ineffective. Glossy puff piece, nothing here to help the average investor make $$$. Buy Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"" (which predicted the current bear market a year before it happened and helps one understand the market and its history), then, get Charles Caes' excellent ""Tools of the Bear"" which helps investors make $$$ in both bear and bull markets."
2,Deceptive Picture - Advertising I Believe,"Picture on the web site as viewed when ordering showed OEM box for ink cartridges. What arrived WAS NOT OEM packaged ink cartridges - but generic cartridges. Have not installed yet as present cartridge is not empty or not in need of change-out.Concerned these generic cartridges will present issues when used, such as clogging of print heads, etc. Disappointed but not willing to spend my money to ship back."
2,Poor printing,The printout has on and off white strikes always in the same area. I think the cartridge is defective
1,Says on Amazon that it will work with 842C - not true,"We ordered this ink based on searching on Amazon for 842C DeskJet ink. Using the function on Amazon for compatibility with printers, it said ""Yes, works with the 842C refurbished printer."" Althought not refurbished, our printer is the 842C DeskJet. When we put in this ink, my printer kept flashing (the ink indicator kept blinking) as it was not registering that the proper ink was installed. Very frustrating as I need this ink for a work presentation. Had to run out and buy it from a local store."
3,HP Ink Cartridge,I ordered a new HP ink cartridge for a reasonable price; however the shipping charge jumped from $5 (off to the side of the order window)to more than $10. I could have bought the cartridge at Office Depot for the same price since the shipping was so expensive and saved myself the wait.
1,Bad Merchandise,This product did not work less than poor money wasted what replacement. And have been trying to contact seller with no help.Don
1,Not worth your time!,"I do not understand the numerous positive reviews for this book. I suppose the totalitarian nature is an intriguing story, but there are much better books written on this topic and story line. It was just not that interesting and the ending was a big let down. The writing style was quite annoying as well. The short sharp sentences are a bit arduous to deal with. Just not a fan of this book at all."
5,A lot of fun,"Wanted to wait a couple months before I reviewed these to see how they stood up. They are a great quiet toy for my four year old. They have stood up to being rolled into tiny balls, twisted together and being left all over the house. As said in their description they never dry out or break. I'm very happy with these, hours of fun for her at a low price."
4,Great entertainment for long road trip!,"Both of my kids, ages 3 and 6, really enjoyed playing with these in the car. They were entertaining and great ""toy"" for the car."
4,"not your gran turismo, but takes a diff. perspective on fun","i have to say i'm very pleased with the purchase of this game. although there are many reviewers out there that have given this game pretty mediocre scores, it all depends on what you really want out of the game.if youre looking for a wide variety of cars to tune up, total realism, and racing countless race after another to earn money, then this might not be your game; however, if you are looking for a game with a great storymode, engaging gameplay, and wonderful electronic soundtrack, then this is it. similar to pilot chatter in acecombat 4, this game carries the same elements that made acecombat so intriguing. the graphics are nice as well.if you were a fan of ridge racer, this might not exactly be your game.. but the fun is still definitley there. i have to emphasize again though, it all depends on what sort of fun youre looking for in the game."
4,A pleasant surprise,"While this game has arcade features and eye candy like most other Namco games, fans of driving simulators will find it appealing thanks to a very good physics engine and a solid collection of real-world cars. This game has excellent replays, challenging courses (including 3 real-world courses), and graphics almost as good at Gran Turismo 3. There are hundreds of racing games out there for the PS2, but I was looking for something to supplement Gran Turismo, that also featured real cars, and challenging action without being frustrating. After many hours with Racing Evolution, I can now say that this is that racing game. ""Total Immersion Racing"" and ""Tokyo Extreme Racer 3"" are two other titles that were very appealing, but they didn't have a feel that approached Gran Turismo 3. This one does. So if you are keeping your PS2 or if you have a need for more games in the GT tradition, this is a solid choice."
3,Sonic the Hedgehog's Antithesis,"Have you ever wanted to feel like you have lightning-quick reflexes even though you know dang well that turtles could effortlessly give you the slip then by all means get this. The Ridge Racer series should in no way be associated with this low-speed crash nor should Gran Tourismo(not by any stretch my favorite but perfect for simulation fans)or Sega GT. No, this is in a class of it's own-low class. Namco can and has done better than this. It is a pretty game, nonetheless, just like Dead or Alive 3 but with most of the curves on the tracks and all of the shaking (or dare I say jiggling? Yes, of course I do!)being confined to car chasis and headlights...well, you should get where I'm going with this. If you don't then this game is just your speed if not too blazing fast for you."
5,Great monitor,"Easy to use monitor right out of the box. Appears accurate and well made. The software is somewhat obtuse so still working with it. Overall, probably the best BP monitor on the market for a great price at Amazon. Shipping fast."
4,"Excellent unit, needlessly oppressive software install","My old pressure and pulse meter died and I bought this unit to be able to download the test results so I could forward the full set to my doctor. Good plan, but the software install suggested that Microsoft's .NET Framework was only optional, but my experience was that it was necessary to get the software to work at all. It was also VERY time consuming to install, and immediately needed an update from Microsoft. Arrrgh! An expensive meter, and apparently very capable, but the software install and design needs another look by the developer. I've installed and used lots of software, but this was not user friendly or even particularly easy to use. It's just a download tool - why so awkward, eh? And why require .NET Framework when even Microsoft's major applications don't need it? More software bloat consuming space on my disk, and now this is the only SW application that needs it. Arrrgh again!"
4,A Worthy purchase,"It is a nice product. Though, I have not tested it rigrously, it seems to be gr8 .I'll be sending it to my parent for use. The best thing is connectivity with computer as you can store much more information records.I would suggest you guys to go for it !! A worthy purchase"
2,A little disappointed,"With my blood pressure level pretty high, my Dr. wanted me to keep a daily check on it. I purchased a Omron HEM 790IT monitor. It lookedlike a well built unit, however I had trouble with getting the cuffon my arm. It would twist around my arm as I was trying to wrap thevelcro end together. The readings were always higher than what my Dr.would get. We tested the unit in his office, and aginst his, we got readings that were 10 points higher. I returned the unit, and got asecond one. This one seems to be the same. The readings are alwayshigh."
2,Omron HEM 790IT,"The unit deflates before it can take a reading and I sometimes get frustrated and simply give up, after multiple tries. Even after checking to make sure that the cuff is properly set I still am unable to get a reading, especially when using the average reading option. Just checked Consumer Reports and hope to pick up one of the one's recommended by them."
4,Pretty easy,The unit does what it claims. I haven't calibrated against an office visit mind you (but I will next time I go in).I haven't tried the software yet either - but that's going to happen as the Doc wants to see the data samples.My operational complaints are that:1. There isn't (to me) an obvious way to do a single retest w/o cycling the unit on/off.2. No way (that I can see) to erase a known bad value (i.e. shirt got in the way). I realize the software can do that but I don't intend to download for a while so how do I remember WHICH reading was bad.
1,Dubious Device,"I began using the Omron HEM-790IT with the hope that I would be able to easily keep track of my blood pressure and monitor my work to reduce it. Imagine my disappointment when I went to my doctor's office for a visit and had them check the device twice against their apparatus, and discovered that the Omron was 10-11 pts higher than what the professional device measured. So much for monitoring my blood pressure, especially since the Omron had measured THE SAME AS the doctor's office equipment just before I left home for that same appointment. I just got my request for a refund from Amazon in under the 30 day limit."
5,Couldn't be easier,Unbelievably simple to use and accurate. I was looking for a simple to use device that I could use every morning before I forgot and this has been fantastic. The PC interface is great for tracking long term trends and printing off reports to take to the doctor. Highly recommended.
5,Blood Pressure Monitor,"I love this moniter, it is very easy to use. The software is very easy to use also, I went to my Dr. with a printout of the past month's readings and even he was impressed with the new monitor I bought."
5,Excellent Monitor,"So much better than expected - consistent, accurate and oh-so-easy to use. After being pitched a dozen different indistinguishable-from-the-next monitors at a local retailer, I gave up and walked away. A word of mouth recommendation steered me at the 790 and I wish I'd never bothered to ask for a store employee's recommendation."
4,Omron HEM-790IT,"The unit pretty much functions as advertised/expected. I have found, however,that consistent measurements depend on exact placement of the cuff on the arm."
3,Omron Automatic Blood Pressure Machine,The machine itself is a very nice machine at a good price. Found it to be accurate but sensitive having to retest each time.I don't like there new style arm cuff cause its hard to manage. I called the manufacture to see if i could get there old style cuff for this machine and was told this was the only one that works with this machine. Disappointed.
1,Omron HEM-790IT,"I used this one for almost a year and was very dissapointed.Very inconsistent readings. Requires at least three measurements to get reasonable results. Check three consequtive reading, right down the spread of results and compare to other blood peassure monitors available on the market. Do not believe that you have arythmia or jumps in your blood pressure. It is the cuff design and the method of pressurizing etc that cause all problems. In addition per Omron customer support cuff life is one year max. Cost of replacemnt $35.I have bought Panasonic blood monitor that very slowly and gently pressurizes during measurements and provides very repeatable and accurate readings. You can just use a single measurement method - it so accurate."
2,Wish I hadn't bought,"Only gave 2 stars because the software is helpful in reporting to my doctor. This cuff is so inacurrate, no matter what I do I am getting readings 10-15 points low. I have compared it to my doc's readings at the office and he has verified this. So, went back to doing it the old fashioned way and just manually entering the data into the nifty software."
4,Monitor,Works wells. Like the ability to print report for my doctor. Need to take to your doctor and make sure it is reading correctly.
2,Arm Cuff too small,I purchased this product on recommendation from my doctor. After receiving several miss-leading readings (HIGH) I brought it in to the doctor to see if it is accurate. Doctor told me my arm too big for cuff and I need bigger one. Would love to know if I can purchase a larger cuff to use. Otherwise a wasted purchase
5,"Simple Operation, Works Great!","So far this machine has worked well and is very simple to use. It is nice to have immediate feedback on the bloodpressure effects of my various exercises, food consumption, and relaxation or stress levels."
4,Very Good!,"This blood pressure monitor is very good at what it's designed to do. With such a limited number of buttons, controlling it is a bit confusing if you want to use any of the more advanced features (memory, etc.). Thankfully, linking the unit to the PC using the included software is easy, and most of your advanced tracking features can be done on the PC."
5,Great to keep track of readings,I love it. No longer do I have to keep track of my reading myself. I'll print them off and take to doctor. Works great for me.
2,Blood Pressure Machine,THis BP monitor has lot to offer in terms of technology..... hmmmm sounds great ...WARNING the basic purpose is to check ones blood pressure where the reading goes haywire i did compare the readings with another monitor another brand and had a reading differential on the Systolic side +10 mmhg while the reading on the diastolic is almost samecompared with other brand... This one really made me scary but then i started using both and now take the average. The cuff is too hard to get adjusted on a thin biceps. Though the software is good... but what do i do with the software as my basic purpose of correct reading is not solved.... i think i am gonna become owner of around 4 BP monitors to find my accurate BP ... cheers
3,Had trouble integrating with computer,The product works excellently by itself without being connected to your computer. I had a lot of trouble configuring the connection at first--even their tech support wasn't helpful but for some strange reason it just started interfacing all by itself. I would have given it a 5-star if it hadn't been for the initial computer-configuration problem. Perhaps they've improved it since I bought my several years ago.
5,First Class,Excellent item and price is good. Nearly silent operation and the AHA triple sample is surprisingly effective in being able to see how your BP varies. The software is fairly straight-forward to use but you must be careful to not import the wrong persons data since once imported you cannot delete it. The same holds true for the monitor itself. Once a reading is taken the only way to delete it is to delete all of that users reading. The only drawback we have found is the cuff can be a little difficult to get tight enough to not slip. If it is to loose the monitor will error out and start over.
1,Unreliable,I would not recommend this product to anyone especially someone who is closely monitoring their blood pressure. The readings were very inconsistant. When I took it to my doctors office to compare readings the Omron was not even close. The doctor's reading was 128/74 the Omron was 158/105. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. It should be labled as a health hazard.
4,One fine product,"I've had this monitor for a couple of months and have used all of the features. The only thing I would criticize would be the limitations of the software in regards to printed graphs of blood pressure statistics. You should be able to make them larger. Omron needs to update this software and make it available to current users. Other than that, it is easy to use, (when you put the cuff on correctly), and provides easy to read information about your blood pressure. My favorite feature on this monitor is the ""true read"" mode where you obtain an average of three readings without having to restart the monitor between readings."
5,Omron HEM-790IT: Outstanding quality,"I received the HEM 790-IT blood pressure monitor about a week ago. I cannot find any problem with it. I have also used model HEM-780 for more than a year. Only big difference between 790-IT and 780, is the addition of software and USB port in model 790-IT. If you do not care about transferring data to PC, HEM-780 is good enough.I compared blood pressure readings from this monitor with manual measurement from my doctors office. The difference was within 5 units. That can happen due to normal fluctuation in our blood pressure. The monitor can be operated using battery or AC adopter. The battery lifetime is really long (more than 3 months for HEM-780 model). I have seen negative comments in few reviews here. I believe they received faulty units. That can happen to any product on rare occasions. You can return this product with ease at Amazon.com, so why worry about it. Overall I am very satisfied with this product and strongly recommend it."
3,Old wine in new bottles,"Who needs this CD? This is the 6th Buddy Greco CD with the same numbers as on Cd 'the greatest hits', 'MacArthur park' and 'like young'.I'm still waiting on a CD with his best EPIC numbers like the 2 AL Cohn albums or his Away we go or Big band and ballads albums from the Reprise period. SONY boys wake up!!"
3,An Adequate Level of Fun,"It's not that Sphinx is horribly flawed, it's just not very good. The camera is mediocre, the targetting system was forgotten, and the gameplay just isn't very fun. With great 3D platformers littering the fields, why bother buying one that's just adequate? Ubisoft has released quite a few great games recently, but this isn't one of them."
5,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER!,"If you are a Zelda lover, I show you Sphinx and The Cursed Mummy. Very much like Zelda but in my opinion, it has better graphics, better story, and a better action-adventure game. You can jump(not like in zelda), do sword combos, and switch from sphinx to the mummy(or tut). So if you are a zelda lover or an action-adventure lover, I suggest this game to you."
3,Volleyball Necklace,Smaller than I thought it would be but my little grand daughter loved it so all is well!
3,Could have been better....,"I-ninja looked like an awesome game, and I expected more fighting in it. You basically do the same thing in all the levels. It has good graphics, and is probably more fun for kids. I'd suggest you rent it first."
3,Where Sky Is Born,"I lived in this town. From this perspective I found the book interesting, dotted with truisms about ex-pats in Mexico and locals whom I know personally. Could be a learning lesson for those with limited overseas' living experience who think they want to buy property in a foreign land. The writing is sophomoric which is what prevents the book from being a must read. It's not bad writing, it just lacks something. If I weren't motivated by personal reasons, I don't know that I would have finished it."
2,Pointless Remake,"Love Don't Cost A Thing is a pointless retreat of 1989's Can't Buy Me Love, a far superior, much more entertaining comedy. At first, the idea of a remake bothered me. Then, I saw the trailer and thought it could be a good urban twist on the familiar story, and I decided to give it a chance. Good casting saves the lackluster script, which really brings nothing new to the story, journeying into familiar territory where we have gotten lost countless times before. Christina Millian, Nick Cannon, and Steve Harvey are all terrific, but the film is slow moving and often boring. A rushed ending does nothing to help it and tops the pizza with an unneeded extra slice of cheese. This could be fun for anyone who hasn't seen the original, but take my advice and rent that one instead. I only recommend this to die-hard Christina, Nick, or Steve fans. Others are better spending the evening with Patrick Demsey."
1,Boring and Stupid,"This movie looked good, since Nick Cannon was in it, from Drumline. However, after watching it, I felt I had wasted the time on it. It was too contrived, used too much slang, and just unbelievable. The chemistry between the actors was good, but that was it. I think the people in the movie, especially Steve Harvey, needed a paycheck. Otherwise, they would have stayed away from this drivel. I mean, the Hope Chest just perpetuated the stereotype of oversexed teens, and there was no evidence of proper parenting in the movie.I'm just glad it was borrowed from the library."
2,Review for Love Don't Cost a Thing,"You'll actually wish you were being subjected to the original, which at least was a mildly charming film with some genuine performances -- in it's day. The movie almost plays like an extended infomercial for all things Puffy. Often rowdy and uproarious, the film also has a suprising depth and subtext. The cast is uniformly high spirited and attractive, and Ms.Beyer's direction, apart from a few over-weighted Wellesian camera angles, is functional. I would not recommend seeing this movie."
2,Average,this film was predictable but it did have some cool moments here&there. I was curious how the film would stand up when I had saw the First one back in the day. alot of Cliches but it has it Moments.Hit&Miss Film at best.
5,This manga was great,"I loved the story line for this manga and the art is beautiful. I can not wait to get the next volume. The story is about a girl named Yaya who hangs out with her so called friends. Her friends use her and make fun of her and she does not like it but she does not want to be alone either. She soon starts crushing on a guy, and certain situations seem to bring out another side of Yaya. She starts telling her so called friends off yet Yaya is unaware of this alter ego and her friends don't believe it is really Yaya. She is a really nice girl but when her alter ego shows up she is a whole new person ready to take on the world. The story is really fun. I suggest it to anyone who likes manga."
1,Hungry Caterpillar Toy,The toy was smaller than anything you would get at a circus or carnival. Very poor quality. I bought it for my 1 year old grandson and was afraid to let him have it.
3,Good band,"This is a good album for those of you who like EWF. I have no idea how current versions are pressed but back when I bought this years ago it had an annoying DRM that had to be cracked to burn it to my Mp3 or PC. I imagine now since the revision of the 2010 digital millennium copyright act the DRM has probably been removed, since it is now legal to make personal copies onto all your listening devices."
5,what the heck i ran into a totally awesome game,this is better than wrestlemania x8 i havent played it but i guarrantee it has like dozens of superstars from the next big thing to the big red machine im telling you im getting this game as soon as it comes out but i wish it was out now cause school coming up
1,This game is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,you cant even do the 619 or west coast with rey mysterio. you do angleslam off the turnbuckle. What is revenge mode with throwing police officers around and without any wrestling. Here comes the pain is awsome. it even has a first blood match and elimination chamber. raw 2 is better then wreslemania. At least Raw 2 has a real season mode and not a stupid revenge mode. so wreslemania is the worst wrestling game ever!!!!
1,Good but not Great!!!,Revenge mode prevents WWE Wrestlemainia XIX from being a great game.If you own a Gamecube get this to play as u wait for Day of Reckoning!
2,Wrestling has truly gone to crap.,"I've noticed that wrestling hasn't been very popular as of late and this game won't help. It is a piece. It is one of the worst wrestling games ever. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the create a wrestler mode is beast and so is exhibition. The reason why the game sucks so bad is because of the revenge mode. It's just like that crappy-lil gb game betrayal. It's got absolutely nothing to do w/ wrestling. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a WWE fan. If you're a fan of WWE, it might be worth a rental. I'm a huge fan, but it just wasn't much fun to play and it's a huge step down from Wrestlmania X8."
5,sassy strikes again,Here is another cute cute sassy toy. The top squeaks and the bottom has a mirror. My four month old son is facinated with the noise it makes and its very easy for him to hold.
5,A Must Read,"This book has to be one of the top 15 business books of all time. If you are starting a business or trying to revamp an exisiting one this has to be the first book you pick up. Not only will it help you put things into prespective, create new systems to get more from less in your business but also help you get more from youself during the redevelopment and startup stages.Pete WilliamsAuthor 'How To Turn Your Million Dollar Idea Into a Reality'"
4,"Great approach and theory, poor presentation","You can't avoid hearing about the 80/20 Principle in life, but this book is the first thing that really forced me to sit down and think criticially about how to apply it. I'd highly recommend this book - particularly the first few chapters - to folks working within a business context. In particular, his examples about how to analyze your current product units were insightful and non-trivial. He doesn't just recommend the obvious thing (cut 80% of your work), but integrates 80/20 with future value and market potential analyses.Similar to the other reviewers, I found the example set rather limited, his statistics and tables motivating but unconvincing, and his prose less than compelling. Even given that, though, this book deserves a read and some serious contemplation."
2,Same principle applies also to this book,"The 80/20 principle is a nice rule of thumb for almost everything in business. Surprisingly it also applies to this book itself, as 20% if the pages have 80% of the useful information.."
3,Same but classic,"15 years ago, it could be fresh but now we can find this kind of books anywhere.20 percent of customers account make 80 percent of revenues.Hmm, we can make some words with result data but not for every case.We can make 10/90 principle, 0.1/0.9/99 principle.10% workers : 90% players.0.1% Genius : 0.9% Business men : 99% us. Sum (these) = Real World in history."
5,Change the way you look at your life!!!!,"After reading hundreds of business books.....80/20 is one of the five I recommend. The book is based on the Pareto principle also know as the 80-20 rule. While telling the tale of success in big and small business the reader begins to understand it isn't just a concept....it is a lifestyle. If you are sick of things being the same....chasing your tail in life and business....this is the book for you. In keeping with the principle, after the first few chapters, there isn't much use in finishing the book....but that doesn't denigrate the inherent value of the message. The sequel books are more of the same (don't waste your money)......once you get the concept.....put the book down and apply to your life and business."
3,"OK, But....","I really liked this principal of the 80/20 theory, but found it hard to listen to his voice on CD. A very mundane voice that lacks motivation for me at least."
2,Too superifical in it's explanations.,"Most of the books on Java are either too technical or they are too superficial in their explanations. Unfortunately, although this book does have ""live code"", complete written out programs for examples, it ultimately falls into the 'too superficial' category. For example, the chapter on classes is very brief and the examples are programs that do practically nothing, so it's difficult to get a grasp for how classes actually work. I recommend instead, ""Java How to Program"" by Deitel and Deitel."
4,Great little strap,"Old strap broke. Wasn't sure about this but after a bit of a struggle to put it on (those little pins are a pain) I like it much better than the factory original. Use it for my heart monitor watch - and I can now attach it to much of the equipment at the gym, as well as comfortably on my wrist. recommended."
4,Very good window unit,The window unit cools two rooms of my house very very well. I just let the door open for the second room and both rooms get absolutely chilled inspite of the high humidity and heat outside( temprature 89+ for the past one week.)And I dont mind the manual switch at all.Its a damn good buy for $ 150 each.
5,Best Music Magazine,"I just got Mojo for the first time. I got it because of the Strokes article but loved the whole thing. They cover so much music in one issue, and I especially love that all the ads are for music. A very expensive import, but certainly worth it."
2,Who needs a subscription when...,You can buy this on the newsstand for the same price. And the best part about the newsstand is that you can pick and choose which month one you want. This saves money since every magazine has a few lame issues that only have a few good articles. you can read those at the store and save eleven dollars. I love the magazine but buying a subscription for it is stupid. The only way a subscription would be good is if you live in a midsized to small town and nobody carries it.
4,What a gem!,"I enjoyed this game more than I have enjoyed a game in a long time. The puzzles are fun rather than irritating, it is not a button masher, and the graphics, music and characters were engaging. The game is a bit buggy (froze on me once) and there are not enough save points, particularly in the mummy sections (where a freeze put me back an hour). Also, some of the battles were hampered by bad camera angles. But overall, the experience outstripped most platform games. I am looking for the sequel!"
4,If you read pass the first three pages you might like it...,"The review that had a problem with the TRAINING excercise in the first three pages might want to actually read the book before commenting. I am sure Marcinko stretches the truth in the book a bit, that's why you write an AUTObiography. The things that go on at times seem larger than life, but it sure is a fun read. He's been in combat, been awarded medals, and served our country proud. I just want to thank him for his sacrifices and sharing his stories. I definately recomend this book for a pretty quick fun read."
3,"Fun read, but not one to give to your mother!","This is a fun read about the creator of SEAL team six. Marcinko's in your face style is entertaining, however, lots of bad language and lewd comments. Enjoyable for the travels, tough schools and assignments."
1,I can't believe any of this is true; this guy is an idiot!,"Sorry Richard, but based on reading your book, you are far too stupid to be a military officer, and far too irresponsible and immature to be a SEAL team commander. SOME of the book may be true, but what parts? Certainly the vast majority of the text is pure fiction. So without a litmus test to gauge the truth from adolescent male fantasy, I just have to assume all of it is bogus. I can't help but think about the fact that there are real American military specialists, operatives, soldiers and sailors who get the job done and do it with dignity for the military salary, and then there's the goofball who writes a fantasy and sells it as non-fiction and in the process, cheapens the sacrifices of real American military heroes. Shame on you!"
4,Not too shabby,"Except for writing about cheating on his wife as if it wasn't a big deal and about the animal abuse in Cambodia (eating the brain taken from a live monkey), the book is pretty good."
5,Most Explosive Book I've Ever Read,"This book is not for the faint at heart. This book is a must read for all action lovers. Richard Marcinko has done what most people dream to do, lead a group of SEALs into enemy territory and survive without a scratch. He is the defintion of tough."
3,Exciting but too much macho bragging,"This book is a realistic and exciting look into the Navy SEALS and the life of an exceptional warrior. However, Marcinko has such a large ego that the narrative is laughable and juvenile. A much more intelligent but equally exciting treatment into the specops world is ""Black Hawk Down"" by Mark Bowden."
1,1/2 star is more like it,"I had the misfortune of listening to Mr. Marcinko during a pep-speech the company I worked for hosted for its employees. He showed up drunk and kept drinking at the podium. His stories were quite boring, exaggerated and I'm surprised the company paid this man as a ""professional"" speaker. Needless to say, I took the free books, had the author sign them and promptly put them on a high shelf. Save yourself the hassle and don't buy this rubbish."
1,"what a mess this novel is: too bad, as Bloom can be good","What a mess! Bloom knows how to pace a short story. Not a novel. This is a manuscript in search of an editor. She can't just throw this together and call it a novel. The tenses shift, the point of view is awry...what was she thinking? She's got a great eye and a great ear but this is a failure of a novel. The good reviews show the respect Bloom has in the literary community, and it is well-deserved, but they pulled their punches on this one. So so NOT recommended unless you're obsessed with Bloom and can't do without."
2,ultimate journey ultimate baloney..,its a lot of unadulterated baloney all that is missing is angels with harps...what is his point i dont get it....
5,recommended,i find this book an interesting read and quite possibly a must read if you are interested in the subject of obe.
1,Disappointed,"I thought I had a good deal with the magazine, but since I work with the Army overseas they would not ship to an APO address -- so therefore I could not take advantage of the price -- what a bummer...."
2,tendentious,"Could more impartial as all the journalism should be, but the media in US is already very tendentious and patriotic, which is not good. When we read an article, we have to see both sides and then think about it and have our own judgement of the subject. This magazine does not give a worldwide view of the news, but the American view of something. Criticism is good because people can think more and analyse more deeply the subject. European and Latin magazines are very critical with themselves, with their own politics, economy and everything else, which is good."
3,Improving...,"Recently I've read TIME and found it was getting better and had more articles. It still has the wierdest choice of cover articles. It doesn't have as good writing as Newsweek but it covers more global topics. It covers more topics than any other news magazine, it covers sports, entertainment, arts, and business and science. Sometimes it forgets about the news. TIME still falls behind Newsweek and US News & World Report and waaaay behind The Economist, nor does it live up to the quality of its partners Sports Illustrated and Entetainment Weekly. But it's not a waste of TIME to read it any more. As for the money? Subscribe, dont buy cover price."
1,"Very good photojournalism, but otherwise shoddy.","The best way to describe Time Magazine is that it is a Cliff's notes for the past weeks events. Shallow and poorly done, the articles are uninformative but have pretty pictures and graphs.The problem is that we already have news Cliff's notes in the form of cable news. Unlike cable, Time does not have video or on demand coverage. It is simply obsolete.If you are buying a weekly magazine, do yourself a favor and read something that will really inform you. I suggest The Economist."
3,Good for an overall picture,"I think Time magazine is a good subscription for those just looking for an overall picture of what's been going on with the U.S mostly. Not too many internationally related articals. The past issue of the 100 Most Influential people was really bad in that they picked the most pathetic examples, i.e Brad pitt, Justin Timberlake. I'm beginning to think Time is a sellout. I would recommend U.S News and World Report instead."
3,nice gift,"Bought this as a gift for someone. The price was reasonable, though I have seen it for less on Amazon. Still, nice magazine."
3,Hate color print,"The color print in the magazine is nearly impossible to decipher. I cannot imagine there is any positive feedback about this . I say, enough cuteness, go back to black and white!"
3,Look out for the magazine's bias,"I have been a subscribe to Time magazine for a year. But not because I truly value the magazine: rather, I was given a free subscription due to AOL's ""gift"" to members. Often times the magazine appears to be a mouthpiece to the liberal point of view. There is endless criticism of our current president, George W. Bush, but often times the magazine provides an enormous amount of praise to liberals of all stripes, from Representative Nancy Polosi to Sen. Edward Kennedy. Also, the letters to the editor that they publish come from seminar-writers--people who have been told to write a certain response to a major news magazine. Well, I'm not re-newing my subscription, and the bias that this magazine has in the liberal direction is the major reason."
1,"Shallow, parochial, and thin with too many pictures","It is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head. It skims the surface and is 'pop'.Anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world.Again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world (Newsweek is exactly the same) especially in the United States.TIME magazine is from the same people that gave us CNN and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the U.S. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice.The other irritating thing about TIME is it's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious.Subscribe to the ECONOMIST, there are less pictures !"
3,Time is superficial eye candy but informative if you don't know how to read,"I got this subscription way cheap. I think like $10 for a year or something ridiculous.The magazine itself is pretty worthless. It's good to have on your coffee table if you have stupid or semi-illiterate guests over, ever.I don't have stupid people over much, so the magazine is pretty worthless to me."
2,Subscription snafus,"Just got off the phone with Time customer service. My background is a 30 year continuous subscriber to Time since 1981. After my last renewal, in July, there has been three cancellations of my subscription. Of course, Time says that I called to cancel which is simply not possible. Why would I do that just so I can call back up to start it up again? Calling customer service is not my idea of fun. Naturally, they have no clue. This time they claim to have sent out a refund based on my debit card payment which is also not possible. Office expenses require a paper check. Nonetheless, customer service tells me that they cannot re-instate my subscription for 90 days in order for that check to not clear. When readership is down they turn away a loyal reader. Isn't that lovely. I like TIME, but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired."
5,good,"Getting the subscription started was fairly easy. Also I had the option of not choosing auto renewal, which is what I like for any subscription."
1,A disappointment,"I purchased this book anticipating the same variety of projects the previous 15 books in the series offer. I was disappionted. Most of the projects in this book use beads, ribbon, and candles. There are no cross stitch projects, no papercrafts such as scherenschnitte or paper twist, no child friendly crafts section. I understand that there are trends in crafting, but the appeal of the previous books in the series was the spectrum of projects, and decorating motifs. The decorating ideas in this book are mainly elegant, fancy, victorian. Using similar ideas in different color schemes. None of which I would consider child friendly."
1,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would","Granted, I didn't use these around the ""base boards"" of my home, but elected to run the cable above doorways and on the wall, near the ceiling (though not from the ceiling). They started removing themselves after 12 hours, with some adhesive pulling away from the wall. In other cases, the adhesive remained on the wall, but the plastic clip instead removing itself from the adhesive. Upon pulling off the non-functioning white adhesive from the wall, I discovered that the product amounted to double-sided, low quality scotch tape with a white foam sandwiched between it.Basically, don't bother with this product."
4,Golden Needles,"I seen this picture many many years ago in the theater and I was trying to find it on DVD, and now I have it is a good movie.Thank you.Amazon"
3,Hard to use,"The book was in good condition for its age. But, being old, it was in small size, pocket book format, and cannot be used on a music stand without damaging the binding. Otherwise, the contents are fine. I was able to find a used hardcover version which does lie flat."
3,Cables To Go 25FT COMPONENT VIDEO CABLE ( 27084 ),"OK product, great price for the length but has an intermittent at one end that screws up the color until tweaked using good old fashioned half baked engineering to get it around until such time as I can zero in on and replace the offending section/connector end so no 5's here.If you buy it, test it before snaking through any walls etc and when snaking be very very careful as it seems to be more delicate than it should be considering it's obviously intended use!"
5,Real great read!,"I purchased the book about a month ago and I must say that besides being a real good read this is one of those books that a serious reader will keep coming back to over a long period of time.I speak some Yiddish but I never could think of ever possessing a book of this wonderful format. I mean I read Yiddish alright but I never really knew that there's a very special spirit behind it!I do recommend the book to anyone who's genuinely interested in real Ashkenazi Jewish culture. I'm also looking forward to receiving the Author's ""Just Say Nu"" book! Being Ukrainian I do use the ""nu"" almost every day myself :)By the way ""Born To Kvetch"" will make many readers with Slavic background smile quite a few times since Yiddish does make wonderful use of Slavic vocabulary, much of it common for Ukrainian and Polish.With great thanks and best wishes to Michael Wex from Kiev,Taras"
5,Twisted,"In my opinion, H.R Giger is the most twisted and sick artist that I have ever seen, in a good way though. His work is only something that you would see in your wildest and most horrific nightmares.Giger has been a great inspiration on my artwork and I reccomend all of his books to anyone who has a strong stomach and loves any work having to do with death and HELL.His website is a very good spot to check out his work at www.hrgiger.com or at www.darkworlds.com . Good luck with the Books and hope you like them."
4,Good For Lookin At When You're Takin' a Crap,"Pretty friggen good. I like to bring this into the bathroom with me to look through when I'm on the can. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in the book that I forget all space and time outside of my bathroom exists. I just gaze into the complexity of each of Giger's works like nothing else matters. It's like I'm right there in the world he has imagined. Last time my grandpa started bangin on the door and he was like ""I gotta take a piss in there, ya jerk!"" and I didn't even hear him. I was in there so long the design on our Sesame Street toilet seat got imprinted onto my rear side and I didn't even know it was there until the girls down at the cat house pointed it out to me. Super embarrassing. My little cousin found this and now he has nightmares about robot worms and stuff like that so he always wants to sleep in my bed and I'm like ""no way Jose, you're gonna pee in it."""
5,the meaning of the necronomicon,"i dreamed of these spaces before i ever heard of Giger. there is one of the secrets of the twentieth century embedded in these images. but only one of them. giger ends by repeating himself & this is not a defect. when you tire of this world, you are grateful to return to the other. but part of it never leaves you, & that is its power."
1,Don't Believe It,"I purchased the unit primarily for use on small watercraft. Magellan advertising specifically recommends the GPS 315 for this purpose and claims the unit is waterproof (page 59 of the owner's manual). Seconds after falling into the lake, the unit filled with water and ceased functioning. Magellan refuses to stand by their claims and their best offer is to replace the unit for nearly the purchase price. The unit's transparent face appears to be made from soft plastic and is very easy to scratch during regular use or while being cleaned."
2,Where are the scripts???,"If you release a second edition you need to support a second edition, that includes the publisher's website and the downloadable scripts that go with the book....this book is okay, but who has time to type in all of the sample scripts to learn. For not including the scripts I give it a 2."
5,"A new, valuable introduction to Int'L Law","The 7th edition of this classic among student textbooks builds upon the clarity and stile Michael Akehurst was famous for, and gives an up to date introduction to International Law. The author, Peter Malanczuk, Professor of International Law at the University of Amsterdam, included systematic references which will enable the reader to begin a journey into the advanced subjects of the Law - if he/she so wishes. Malanczuks perspective is broad and serves the needs both of students in International Law and in International Relations."
3,"a little dated, but...","I'll second the previous reviewer's call for an updated edition. Apparently the next edition, the 8th, is due for release in February 2008."
5,A look back at greatness,"This is a great book about a stellar player. There is a nice mix of biographic material, as well as numerous annotated chess games. There is a lot to be learned from playing through the games of Morphy. Even if you begin to emulate this remarkable player in just the slightest degree, your chess will benefit a great deal. Unless you really dislike chess, you will be hard pressed not to be in awe of his remarkable blindfold demonstrations. This man played better chess as a teenager than I may ever play in my entire lifetime. Grab a coffee, grab a chess board, and most definitely grab this book and treat yourself to some truly enjoyable games."
4,Not the product pictured,"I thought I was ordering the regular Boost shown in the picture, but I received a case of Vanilla boost in different bottles marked ""For Institutional Use Only"""
2,protein?,No where on your site do I see where you tell the protein quantity on this. Boost comes in two different protein levels for their 8 oz size. How do I know whether this is a decent price for this product if I don't know what level of protein it contains?
5,Bigfoot mystery,"The title says it all. The author does an excellent job of weaving his tale through the eyes of two young brothers who stumble upon an unusual site while hiking in the redwoods. After their encounter they go searching for answers with their family and find more questions at times than answers. The author keeps the story interesting with a mix of science, natural history, and good characters based in a family atmosphere. Great for young and older readers. Can't wait to explore ""Yeti or Not"""
4,ive watched this from the beginning,"series is good and comical, judge is easy to understand and i like her sense of humor there have been some cases where i think she brazenly overreacts but this is a show..so that is understandable she does tend to go on tangents if you dont want to hear her rant at someone then dont buy it."
4,Interesting Plays,I have read this book and I believe that the plays are rather wel written. These plays are rather simple to perform onstage and some are quite comical. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a current theatre buff.
5,Sturdy and helpful for cosmetics,"The organizer is particularly helpful, in assisting the tubes, or narrow items to stand up. Without this, they all fall down in chaos, and make it difficult to see what you have. The different sizes of the channels works nicely. However, the lipstick compartment openings are too small for square shaped tubes, only narrow round lipsticks will fit in it. So I removed the lipstick subcompartment, and use the open space for other things. Really like it overall, and it's strong enough to last forever. Washable, and clear are very nice qualities too."
5,A very dark comedy for those who enjoy political wit,"I was one of the 3 or so people who actually saw this film in the theatre and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It's an excellent, funny, satirical look into the world of professional boxing where athletes, who risk their physical health and financial future, are treated like commodities for the gain of promoters, who risk nothing and always get the big payoff. The flamboyant promoter (Samuel L. Jackson) deftly uses white America's obsession/anger with African-American dominance in sports to produce a payday as the media plays a willing pawn in the game. All of the performances in this movie are excellent but Peter Berg deserves a special mention."
2,Kinda funny but pretty racist,"There were some funny moments in the movie but if the roles were reversed the black community would be in uproar. If it was making fun of black kids taking the SAT instead of white people boxing it would be deemed racist. I guess it's not even so much the boxing angle but how white people are portrayed. You have Corbin Bernson (whatever) doing his sissy act from Major League 2, Jeff Goldblum as the nerd, the boxer is just a clueless foolio, and Jon Lovitz is well, Jon Lovitz. The thing is I wouldn't even care if there wasn't such a double standard. It's just the fact that racism is okay if it's against whites that bothers me."
3,Had the potential to become a great movie,"After watching Major Payne, I thought I would try another Damon Wayans' movie, but found this one a great disappointment. The cast were all star, and the story line was good, but I think comically it could have done a bit more. Still a good movie, but certainly not anything the actors who starred in it would be boasting about."
3,A disappointment,"Mother Love by L.R.Wright Seal Books 1995I have read several other L.R.Wright mysteries and liked them very much. This one was not up to the high standards set by the others.In this Karl Alberg mystery, a murdered woman had left husband and 13 year old daughter seven years previously with only a smidgen of a note that told hardly anything of why she left. Karl will not rest until he has solved the puzzle relating to her death and disappearance. The story is a bit contrived and moves at a very slow pace.The long standing romance of Karl and Cassandra Mitchel has picked up finally and they have decided to get married and have begun house hunting. As always, L.R.Wright's description of Sechelt is vivid and evocative and adds immeasurably to the story."
4,Another Rickie Lee Jones Great Album,"Rickie Lee is a wonderfully versatile artist. This album allows Rickie Lee to express musically the social conscience of the common people in the Los Angeles. With love of the everyperson coming through, she provides us with more of her folk/jazzy/rock, really rather individual style that has made me true fan for years. This matches nicely with her other artistic music."
4,the Gospel according to Lou Reed,"Rickie Lee Jones' ""The Sermon"" reminds me of Lou Reed's ""New York, New York"" except that it is less negative. It is based on a book called ""The Word"" - a paraphrase of the Gospels, but I can't tell if it glorifies Jesus Christ or criticizes Him. ""Falling Up"" is the best song on the album."
2,WOW!!! WHAT A SLEEPER!!!,"I couldn't finish it!! I have been reading it for two weeks, , ,and, , ,only made it to page 150!!! Not exactly a barn-burner.Yep, I gained some insight about the DUST BOWL plight, , ,but Ialso slept a lot!!! 15 pages----night, night!!!"
5,Oh My God,"My boyfriend is so sick of me reading this book because after every page, I should ""Oh My God, listen to this."" He finally broke down and got the audio version (he travels) so he could catch up and discuss with me.The book is that good. Get it."
4,"Calling it a ""Hard TIme"" doesn't do it justice...","Of course I'd seen the photos - but the intensity of the suffering of those who lived through the dust bowl was still not clear to me until I read this. It is certainly not a light, happy read and I would have appreciated a little broader scope to the reporting, but by concentrating on the Texas & Oklahoma panhandles at the epicenter of the disaster Egan has provided a human-scale description of real life in real hard times. I won't be bored the next time I drive through on I-40. From the Cherokee to the XLT ranch to the wheat boom to the dust bowl in less than 80 years, that country saw change like no other."
3,Good read but could be even better,I found the history of the people who stayed and went through the Dust Bowl expereince to be very interesting.I would like to have read more about the current status of the land and some of the people who remain alive and living in the towns discussed in the book.I think a whole chapter should have been devoted to telling the cuurent story of the land in some detail
3,History lesson,Explains a lot about the dust bowl. very interesting but more like a history lesson than a novel. wish it had spent more time on the actual bios of the people involved.
5,Who was to blame?,"Timothy Egan makes several overt and not so overt references to the High Plains farmers being to blame for the Dust Bowl due to incorrect plowing methods. Of course it's easy to look back in time and say, ""they should have done this"" or ""shouldn't have done that"". These were very poor people to begin with, they saw a market hungry for their output and a government anxious to encourage their production. Contour plowing and turning under the topsoil were not issues they would have been concerned with in the environment they labored. In fact, the solutions from FDR did not reverse the problems which even Egan admits still exist. This is a very well-written, and well-researched book despite Egan's rush to judgement."
5,Compelling history of Dust Bowl,"This is an excellent book about the Dust Bowl and those who stayed behind to survive it. The details are vivid and well-researched, and the book is beautifully written. I've been recommending it to all my friends; for me it's an unforgettable, gripping look at the past with lessons for the present and future."
4,"Dust, poverty, desperation and then you die of dust pneumonia.",I enjoyed this book as it gave a viseral picture of the Dust Bowl as it was experienced by the poor folks who had no choice but to live in desperation.
4,"Wonderful, detailed account","What a well written account! I have always heard little bits and pieces of stories concerning the ""Decade of Dust"" from various sources but never read anything about it. While the author was very detailed in his research and writing, what I found most interesting was the way that the story is put together. He has managed to intertwine various stories from different families throught the region to create a very interesting look at the events that took place not only in the most efected areas but on a national level as well. The story really made me feel the hardship and suffering that these people endured during this time. I highly reccomend the book."
3,Very depressing,It seems there is too much repetition in the story. It gave me a new insight into the trial of the people who experienced this tragedy.
4,An era captured,Egan does a wonderful job of capturing this important trial for so many American people. The research from real people's journals makes for an interesting read. The result is a thought-provoking comparison to how American handled a vast emergency pre-Katrina.
4,Glad I Wasn't There,The writing is quite gripping and really draws the reader into this time period using the reported facts along with horrifying accounts of those who lived through it.
4,Wow,"You read fiction like The Grapes of Wrath and believe that you know what happened, but we dont. Great book great lesson of struggle and triumph."
3,"Good story, strangely written","I concur with most of the previous reviews that Egan tells a powerful story that paints vivid pictures that will stay in your mind forever. But, there is a problem: I had a hard time actually reading this moving story - it read in a jerky manner - I then realized he strings together paragraphs that don't hold together, changings thoughts, characters and locales midparagraph. It was so subtle at first, but when I saw it I was tense reading the book, not knowing what to expect.This may sound so minor considering it was conceptually a terrific book,but it really detracted from my enjoyment. Sorry..."
4,The Worst Hard Times,Not only was it an entertaining book but quite a history lesson. The fact that the charactors in the book were real and the events were true made it more interesting. The descriptions of the living conditions were so graphic that it made me thirsty just reading it.
3,The Worst Hard Time,"I enjoyed this book and learned something, as I had no idea of the extent of the Dust Bowl. The book was a little hard to follow as it jumped around a bit too much and became somewhat repetitive. I would have preferred it concentrate on one or two families and be a bit more descriptive about the geographical areas affected by the Dust Bowl and then link those areas to how they are today both in writing about them and in pictures. After finishing the book my questions were ""So what happened the next year? When did it rain? Did the dust storms stop? Were the land conservation efforts successful enough to save people from the devastation their lives had become? For those that stayed, did the decision pay off in the long run? The pictures that were included were fascinating, as were the descriptions of daily living. It was a very interesting book and I would recommend it to others, but perhaps not as a first book about the Dust Bowl."
5,What government can cause,"This is very well-written book. Can hardly put it down. Gives the history and govenment involvement in the causes of the dust bowl. Can relate to what the government is doing today. There is always more to and event than we realize and anyone involved in government and agriculture as well as history will find this a very informative book. It was recommended to me by a friend who was a teacher and loves reading. As I began reading I expected to find a ""green"" read but not at all. It gives facts in a very good historical novel way. I have really appreciated it as that is the type of book that I love and being so well-written is a huge plus."
5,Never seen anything like it !,This is an exceptional pin and could not have been more perfect if it walked itself to the door. Very impressive and is even better than pictured.
3,"Service great, the watch- not so much.","The service and shipping on this watch were great. It came when expected and all was well. The watch looked new and it works fine. But 3 weeks after I got it, I had aproblem with the rotating numbered bezel around the face of the watch. The numbered inlay fell out!! Needless to say I don't know where it fell out so it is probably gone forever. I have owned other Invicta's and never had a quality issue so I was shocked. The price was so low on the watch I am even wondering if it is worth the hassle of getting it repaired or sending it back in to be replaced. I am really dissapointed in the quality. The watch still works fine but it looks bad without the numbered ring. I used to rave about the quality of Invicta to family and friends but with this watch Invicta hasn't given me anything to rave about."
3,Cute movie,Cute movie but not worth $4 it should be marked down to $2.50 because it is only about 30 minutes long or at least sold in a set with another Christmas movie.
3,IN SEARCH OF SANTA,"At a mere 25 minutes, it's hard to find too much wrong or right with this minor entry in the ICE AGE franchise.All the popular characters are back and a new one added---the reindeer Prancer, aptly voiced by Seann William Scott.It's light holiday fare with Peaches the baby mammoth venturing off to the North Pole to prove Santa's existence. Okay family fun, and maybe someday Scrat will get his nut!!!"
5,"Well, I loved it!","My 2 and a half year old was too preoccupied with the year of his Christmas presents to enjoy, but I'm sure it will be muchly appreciated in years to come."
3,Its OK,"As always, Skrat is the star.I believe the producers have run out of story lines.For me it was a waste of money."
4,"Over priced, but still cute","Our kids love this episode and it has a funny story consistent with previous Ice Age films. The downside is that it is only a 30 minute episode and is over way too quickly for the price. At least with this, you do get the digital copy."
4,nuts,i love this moive though it was short i thiought it was so funny and i could watch it over agian
3,Not well made,"With adult supervision, we had one session with the bug maker before the power switch broke, never to work again. [Broken] the day after Christmas. Extremely disappointing."
5,The single best toy your can buy for your son,"I have a soon to be six-year-old son, and we spent our weekend making countless creepy crawlers. He has had this toy for over two years, and we still have a great time making bugs. It is a great activity that allows us to spend quality time together. We try to see who can make the coolest bugs--he even makes them for his friends. This toy gives children an opportunity to express themselves and be creative. I have never had a problem ordering the 'goop', I can always get it via Amazon.com. The ONLY downside is that we can't find additional trays, and that if they would make trays that contained butterflies, this would be equally entertaining for girls, too. I have purchased this for many children as a gift, and the response is always the same...they love it! It's nice to still have toys that families can enjoy together, that doesn't involve the TV or Nintendo. Pleased Mom in PA"
4,"Nice toy, But buyer beware!","The Toy is nice and fun for kids to make bugs and then play with them. BUT, I was at 'Toys-R-Us' today trying to get extra ""goop"" for this toy and they told me that this toy has been discontinued. They still sell it though without any clearance notice on it. So the only way to get extra ""goop"" and molds is directly from Toymax - and they are very very very slow. I sent them a check a month ago and I am still waiting for the goop - they told me it is in the mail... P.S. Don't forget to get the light bulb for this toy if you give it as a gift."
2,Uninspired and outdated,"I bought this album in Germany based on the strength of the reviews of previous work (and the fact that none of the previous work was available in the stores I visited).I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed, not by the quality of the musicianship, which is generally good (and features Vinnie Appice - he of black Sabbath fame), but more by the the lack of any real dynamism or drive in the tracks.I can only describe the overall feel as if the album were written for a mid-80's audience as the song structures are somewhat uncomplex and the production rather thin. Lana Lane is captured within the genre progressive, however, the description is in my view way off the mark. This is nothing more than poor pop metal.In summary, what we have here is is musical fast food. Pleasing enough during consumption but instantly forgettable."
5,THE BEST BOOK SERRIES EVER,"The Cat Who is the best serries ever full of humor wit and complexity,James Macentosh Qwilerin is a off beat repoter/Billion air with his 2 cats Koko and Yumyum who are no shorter than extra ordinary.This is the best book serries I have ever read and would recomend it to any one over 10.Trevor Oliver12 Years old"
5,"Great book, very helpful","In preparation for our two-week trip to Wyoming, I purchased this book and read as much as I had time for beforehand. During our trip, I found it to be a handy reference for whatever area we were in (mostly Yellowstone/Grand Tetons). The detail is great and some of our lodging choices and attraction choices were made with reference to the book and it was always accurate. I highly recommend it for those heading to Wyoming."
1,Don't bother,"As with so many things, even very small children will ignore the imitation meant to be ""just like Mommy's"" in favor of the real thing. My son has chewed on the tassle a few times at the height of a teething episode (and then decided it wasn't even satisfactory for that), but he has completely ignored the key aspect. I ended up waiting until he was a year old and giving him a set of real blanks on a wrist coil key chain. THEY are one of the first toys he asks for every morning -- and the Sassy keys remained untouched in the toy box. My niece was the same way -- they were actually HER keys first, and we ""inherited"" them because she never played with them. You win some, you lose some. But inexpensive as these are, I wouldn't buy them again."
4,DRIVE AND DROOL KEYS,"AS WE ALL KNOW, BABIES PUT EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN IN THEIR MOUTHS. THE FIRST TIME MY BABY TESTED OUT HER NEW DRIVE AND DROOL KEYS, SHE GAGGED HERSELF. NEW MOTHERS BEWARE!"
5,Great flick,i love this movie. its passionate and not a cheesy love story. i wanted some food after watching this movie! :p
4,Like Water For Chocolate,"In the novel, ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" I found it very interesting that two young people, Tita and Pedro fell deeply in love and they could never marry each other. The best part about the book was that they had to hide their feelings from everyone but they knew they loved each other deep inside their hearts. I liked the fact that they loved each other until the day they died and they died making love to each other. I strongly recommend this book to other people."
4,"Five Stars for content, Four Stars for media","This is a beautiful story that made the transition from novel to cinema quite gracefully. I would not consider not owning this film -- I have to have it. Even the supporting actors are fantastic. My two favorite supporting roles: Gertrudis and Chencha! What gems! The cinematography is gorgeous.I wanted to give this 5 stars because I love this story so much, but the DVD has a lot of artifacts from what appears to be a fairly battered copy of the film. The most salient artifacts are the reel cues (which appear as ragged circles along the right edge, centered vertically.) Except for these problems, the rest of the video transfer is quite well done with minimal compression artifacts. I suppose the sound is as originally mastered: stereo. We all love our surround sound, but this film is carried by the story so it isn't missed much."
1,defective DVDs - beware,"This DVD that Amazon is selling is defective. It won't play past the intro and just freezes in place. I had them replace the 1st one and the 2nd did the exact same thing, My guess is that they have aa defective lot. Amazon really needs to clean this up before they sell any more."
5,great music for anyone,"I think that this CD has a lot of great material. The songs are written well, and the music is enticing. I hope that Kerry keeps making music like this, because I really enjoy listening to it."
5,Soul-found Loving Energy,"It is not only the musical strength of this album but it is even more so the words. The soul searching depths of love and questions and answers, every detail of Kerry's lyrical choices are so powerful that they brought together two people who did not yet know that they were in fact seeking each other out.A lifetime of Thanks to Kerry who not knowing it or me at that time, allowed two gentle people to explore themselves and the potential passions that they held within their core. And who through exploration of Kerry's thoughts and creativity, were allowed to truly love.This album is a must for seekers, lovers, dreamers and folks of earthly peace. You know who you are, seek for yourself this album."
4,The nexus of theory and empirics,"This book is enormously interesting. The study of the presidency has evolved from biographical insights, to cumulative insight, to quantitative and formal modeling. Hargrove provides an interesting middle ground by constructing a foundation for analysis which harkens back to the big questions of politics (from Aristotelian rhetoric onward) and applies them to the study of the American presidency. Some insights are profound, others the stuff of common sense. Regardless, he provides a novel way to think about the presidency and does a great service to all who want to truly further their understanding of the institution."
2,A thin year for the Booker,"Don't read the following if plot spoilers bother you.The one won the Booker Prize in 1975. Must have been a thin year. Fascinating step-grandmother goes to colonial India in the 20s with her husband, meets charming yet mysterious prince, gets knocked up, has an abortion, runs off with him. Not-so-fascinating step-granddaughter goes to independent India in the 70s alone, meets not charming and unmysterious clerk, gets knocked up, doesn't have an abortion, runs off alone. Told in parallel plot lines because, well, I'm not sure. The writing is unexceptional, the characterization even less so. Pat. Very pat.Why sacrifice all drama, suspense, and interest in the plot? To seem more ""literary""? To illustrate how deep the feeling and dilemmas of their characters are? Why characters of such thin merit, so thinly explored? Who knows."
1,Poorly written book,"I learned by myself VisualBasic 6, and C++. When I started reading this book I realized that it was a waste of money. In every chapter it tells you exactly what to do and you do it like a parrot. The explanations are very terrible. I already read half of the book and it sucked. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.It just sucks!!!"
3,Not very deep,"I bought this book because I was looking for a reference to help me use Visual C++ to develop some Windows applications. This book doesn't cover dll development, API calls, or any of the low level things you would want to do in a ""real"" application. It does give you most of the information you would need to develop simple applications but stops there."
4,Better than you are told,"For some reason, Erich Maria Remarque and Somerset Maugham have found themselves ranked in the second tier of 20th Century English Language Novelists. ""The Night in Lisbon,"" which is not his greatest novel, is far better than Hemingway's lesser works. Remarque was a remarkably consistent writer of quality, thought-provoking literature. Two or three of his books should always be required high school and college reading. I highly recommend this book and I can't imagine anyone, who likes quality fiction, who would be disappointed."
4,"A solid, compelling read","Here's an undervalued book, recently reissued by the New York Review of Books. It tells the grim story of an academic who has lived a very unhappy life and had a very ""B"" level career at a midwestern university. There are engaging insights into the pettiness of academic politics and the kind of grudges professors hold against one another, as well as the turf they try to protect. Lucidly written and engaging, especially for those who know a bit about academic life."
2,Maybe I'm missing something,"I was looking forward to reading this book after all the reviews. While it was well written and the characters are well developed, I found it pretty boring and wondering why I had spent the time finishing it by the time I got to the end."
3,Cat lovers,"I am a sucker for cats which is why I originally brought the first book in the series. They are all about a new reporter Mr Q and his two siamese cats YumYum and KoKo. KoKo is a cat who has a habit of solving mysteries and both cats have great personalities.This one didn't contain as much suspence or action as the first book I read, but I never picked up the who done it for the crimes so it keeps your interest.I would recommend for cat lovers, those who want a quick read and those who want a book that you can pick up and put down again when time permits"
2,"Loud, LOUD, very very loud, and ultimately a source of infection!?","I've had this unit for two years now, and while it does cool well and is feature rich (sleep timer, 0-100 fan speed settings, filter cleaning light), it was so loud we had to watch TV with headphones or have phone conversations in the other room. It would wake us up at night when it cycled up to full power to keep the room temp consistent with the thermostat setting.Additionally, it somehow (and I've never had this happen before) became an incubator for some sort of incredibly gross black mold, which has coated the entire interior of the unit (especially the air path), making it a spewing spore dispenser. I currently have a major respiratory infection which began the morning after running this unit for 6 hours overnight for the first time since last summer; my wife had a nasty cough all morning as well.I'm dumping it and getting a Kenmore 76081 - $200, much quieter, same specs, much better review record."
1,Incredibly loud,"Like others have said, this unit is unbelieveably loud, negating other good features it has (ability to cool quickly, not too hard to install, etc). I returned it and purchased a Kenmore, and they are night and day."
1,"Yep, it's loud.",These people aren't lying to you. This thing is unreasonably loud. It's between 10-20 dB louder than its competitors.
1,Wish I had read these reviews...,I'm on my way back to Lowes right now - I wouldn't even dream of trying to sleep with this thing on. I will never buy another Frigidaire product. This is frankly an insult - I can't imagine how any reasonable person working at Frigidaire would listen to this thing for a minute and decide that it was good for the home Market. It makes my bedroom sound like a meat storage facility. I'm going to splurge and buy a Sharp. Live and learn.
4,Bedroom Delight,"I like Frigidaire products. This is the fourth Frigidaire A/C I have purchased. I have replaced all the A/C units in the house. With a hot summer behind us and more to come I am glad I've made the decision to replace my older units. The difference in the electric bill is appreciated. This unit replaced a sears unit that was the same size 8,000BTU. That unit was six years old and still ran but not efficiently. The noise level is about the same but the run times have shortened a lot and it has a better system of directing the air flow."
5,great book for beginners,"Our dermpath attending recommended this book. It is gorgeous with lovely photos. The book has only the most common diagnoses. The left page is all text, and the right page is a super high quality photograph illustrating the features of the diagnosis. Great for the beginner!"
4,Like an extra long arm,"my new car has the windsheild so far away that i had to put the seat all the way foward and strech just to clean the windshield, not anymore."
1,Not as shown!,"These are not the handy drop-in liners as shown in the picture. You must wrap the top over the bottle. The first time I used, it spilled and I lost half a bottle of milk (not ideal as my supply was questionable anyway).In addition, the measurements on the side are extremely inaccurate. I used these with my Playtex 4-oz bottle (the bottomless kind) and it didn't fit correctly! The edges push against the sides so what reads as 3 oz is really only maybe 1.5. This would not be safe for formula feeding.Worst product ever!"
3,Great Gift #1,"Since I purchased this gift for a friend, I can't really comment on its contents. But I know he will just love the book."
1,Waste of Time and Money,Spent your money elsewhere if you are looking for a book to improve your game. You will not find it here.
2,Extremely uneven set for the Shaver fan,"While Shaver completists will no doubt ""need"" this CD in their collection (I did - and I'll keep it), this is not the live album I was hoping for. Shaver's songs, overall well-delivered, are overpowered by Friedman and Company's personality and off-the-wall performances. Familiar only with Friedman by name, I didn't know his music before buying this record and have no desire to hear any more. I felt the pairing ruined any enjoyment to be gleaned from Shaver's contribution.The Friedman fan, however, may really, really like this record - and may even say Shaver drags it down - the two styles really do not complement one another. Should you like both, you're probably in luck.The Shaver fan awaiting another UNSHAVEN should keep waiting and pass this one by. And the Shaver-curious looking for live thrills should grab that record instead of this one - it's a far better example of Shaver's power fronting a live band."
3,very Dissapointed but kid loved it.,"my 2 year old son, loves it, i just got it. but i was so dissapointed of how cheap the plastic is. i mean i wanted to return it but its too much hassle; so i decided to keep it. my son is having a blast!! but they should do the base out of metal NOT PLASTIC, or at least make it more durable.BUT IF YOU HAVE A SON LIKE MINE (GETS TIRED OF TOYS EASILY), THERE IS NO NEED THEN ON SPENDING MORE MONEYTHIS IS A VERY ENJOIABLE TOY.HE LOVED IT. I MEAN HE SPENT LIKE AN HOUR OR MORE PLAYING WITH IT; WHICH IS A RECORD FOR COMPARING TO THE OTHERS TOY HE HAS."
3,OK shopping cart,"This cart definitely is not super durable. The ""metal"" parts do not necessarily create stability. Even though, my 2 year old daughter loves it! It hasn't taken that big of a beating yet so we will see what happens when that day comes!"
3,I wanted to love this,"It's a cute cart and the kids love it and the groceries that come with it, but it's really disappointing durablility-wise. It's always coming apart. It doesn't break, but you have to snap it all back together. When the basket isn't coming apart, it sags. Overall, very weak holding up to normal 2 1/2 year old play. I will look for something much sturdier. Btw, the groceries are pretty cheaply put together as well and are easily crushed, torn, etc."
1,You get what you pay for...,"While our daughter certainly enjoyed playing with it, the lack of quality really detracts from the experience. The cheap plastic wheels tend to jam up and it's not at all sturdy (easily bent out of shape). If you have younger children in the house I'd even say this is a bit dangerous as there's nothing to prevent a toddler from tipping it over. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap..."
4,A Little Disappointed,"I was excited to find this perfect size shopping cart for my 2 1/2 yr old nephew, but was disappointed to find when it arrived that only the bottom part of the frame was metal and the basket plastic. I was under the impression that the whole cart would be metal. I hope it lasts at the hands of my nephew!"
5,The film of the 90's,"If you are going to se one film from the 90's, this is it. Warmth, humor, and friendship like I've never seen before. Jack Nickolson says; ""You make me want to be a better man"". Well this film makes me want to be a better friend. Possibly the most brilliant film ever."
5,My Stubborn Inaccuracy Kept Me Away... ARGH!,I boycotted this film when it first came out because I got so stuck on the May-December romance between the characters and in so doing missed that this movie is about SO MUCH MORE!!!The performances are about as crystal clear as one could imagine.Greg Kinnear was absolutely fantastic as Simon... the artist... he played the perfect connective fiber along with his dog... who was as big a star in the movie as the humans.Nicholson is top notch as is Helen Hunt.....Spotless performances thoughout absolutely require you NOT be as stupid as I was and GO! Watch this DVD now or forever... miss out on an incredible movie with a deeper message than you might initially think.
1,Oscar-worthy? Hell NO!,"Oh, please! Oscars for Nicholson and Hunt for this film...? Shocking! Robert Duvall (remarkable in ""The Apostle"") and Helena Bonham Carter (magnificent in ""The Wings of the Dove"") were robbed at the 1998 Oscar ceremonies. Nicholson played Nicholson. And Hunt...don't get me started on that one...! ""Someone please comb that woman's hair!"", I wanted to scream at the screen (in between glancing at my watch and longing for a cigarette, which I had long before quit). The writing sucked. Hey, James L. Brooks, what was that little roadtrip to Baltimore about? Did it not strain credulity that the gay guy (OK, Greg Kinnear is cute) would hop in the car and drive to Baltimore instead of picking up the phone and calling mom and dad? Answer: Yes. It was not a very clever way of trapping our three leads in a car so they can bond and be adorable. I loathed this movie and will lobby Congress to pass a law banning James L. Brooks from ever making another cutesie-wutesie movie."
5,"As Good As It Gets, No really.","This is one of my favorite movies. I enjoyed it very much. The acting, screenplay, and the directing were teriffic. Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinner are a prime example of a thing called ""character development"". It shows it and I, for on, loved it. I suggest that As Good As It Gets should be viewed. Buy this movie. I promise you will not regret it."
4,well acted,"this is a funny film, with some of the greatest lines ever written for jack nicholson--and he has had some great ones. but helen hunt has started to get on my nerves the more i watch this film. i've not been a big fan of hers and in this movie she just feels abnoxious. still, thankfully it doesnt take too much away from the great acting by both jack nicholson and greg kinnear, who was truly wonderful as the gay neighbor."
4,good film,I wanted to replace my VHS version. It was kinda fun to watch again on DVD. Fun movie great acting.
1,"Awful, I don't know how did it get an oscar!!!","I was shocked when I saw the film, it was really boring. Helen Hunt was o.k., but the others are not. The story is soooo silly, disgusting and I really wasted my time on watching it. It didn't worth any oscar at all!"
5,Excellent!!!!,"Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, an obsessive compulsive, self centered, politically incorrect novelist in Manhattan with serious issues and a loud mouth. But when his neighbor is hospitalized Melvin is forced to babysit his dog, letting someone (or something) into his apartment for the first time EVER. The unexpected act of kindness - along with helping his favorite waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt) - helps put Melivn back in the human race and suddenly people start to like him. This is a great movie! Not just a chick flick! It is a romantic comedy, but guys will love with crude humor and jokes!"
5,Very Funny,"Jack Nicholson gives a great performance in this film and so does Greg Kinnear. Helan Hunt also gave a good performance but not in my opinion an Oscer winning one. Nicholson plays Melvin, a writer with obsesive compulsive disorder. When his normal waitress Carol quits her Job to look after her sick child, melvin decides to pay for their own private doctor. This starts a topsy turvey love story. Melvin tries hard to impress Carol throughout the film but every time he opens his mouth he makes things worse. Nicholson has some very funny lines in this movie which makes it a very funny movie who everyone should enjoy."
4,A nice relaxed romantic-comedy-drama,"A very funny and dramatic film. It's one of those movies that just makes you smile. It's a relaxing film starring Shirly Knight, Harold Ramis, Cuba Gooding Jr., Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson."
3,OK for a M-F pair of bettas or guppies,"This is the one gallon version which is the only size available any more, it seems. I have successfully kept guppies, bettas, and one small goldfish in one of these. The main advantage is large surface area for a one gallon vessel. I wish they would manufacture the 2.5 gallon size again which is much more usable. A round undergravel filter and a live piece of freshwater seaweed is the best way to maintain good water quality without ruining aesthetics."
1,too small,fish are living animals - not toys or playthings for humansget a LARGE tank if you MUST keep fishthen treat them well
5,Marine Fuel Pump,"Great product, with quick shipping. Took about five minutes to install and works flawlessly. Would recommend to anyone with an older outboard. I replaced the factory fuel pump with this one because the old one had a stripped out center bolt hole. This this works great."
3,"Not very user-friendly, too much emphasis on Weka language","This book was used as one of the two textbooks in a graduate school database course. It is hard to follow and places too much emphasis on the Weka data mining language (the authors developed Weka). As a data mining beginner, I had to consult several other data mining references in addition to this book."
3,"very useful academically, but not industry focused","It is a very clear and easy reading 'machine learning' book to read, but its not a 'data mining' book. Everyone in the industry agrees that over 80% of your time and effort is in the data preparation, yet this book has virtually no mention of data transformations or data preparation.It is a good book that describes how algorithsm works, their pros and cons. Very useful for new starters and academics. It won't help a industry practitioner though.Page 360 onwards to 500 are dedicated to using a freeware data mining tool named Weka.The book was worth the buy, but I had hoped for more.- Tim"
2,Dissapointed,"I'm about 1/2 way through the book and do intend to finish it. However, I must say, this is very tough reading. I think the author tries not to use a lot of math and algorithmic speak but ends up using descriptions that aren't very clear or easy to follow.Plus, this book really does require a background in this topic. Perhaps a few books as pre-requisites would make this material easier to understand.The author separates the more math intensive stuff in paragraphs marked as optional but to be honest, these are the sections that I found easier to understand.Anyway, I really wanted to like this book. But unfortunately, I did not."
3,wedding shoes,"I'm giving them a 3. I was fortunate and got them for a lower price than that currently listed, and to be honest I don't think I would have paid the listed price. They are indeed cute shoes, although I was a little disappointed that as the picture makes you think, they go up higher on your feet. It's an awkward place where the end of the shoe falls, almost halfway on the average toe. I didn't care as they were my wedding shoes, as long as I could dance I was happy.The reason I gave them that many stars is that they are comfy, and didn't leave one mark on my foot after a summer wedding night filled with lots of walking, some running, and a lot of dancing."
1,Shipped remanufactured toner :(,"Very Disappointing. The advertisement stated that the toner was an original HP new cartridge, but it's not. Now I have to go through the return process.. :<> great....who pays for this waste of time ?"
5,Great collection,"I bought this back in 1984. Rick James was still bringing the Funk. 17 was the main cut. another classic Rick James Funk Cut. dug the Bass Riffs on this Jam. all of the Classic Rick James Jams are on here. I dug the Vintage chuck Berry phase that Rick was using during that time period. this was the first of many Rick Greatest Hits packages. this one is stil slamming. Rick James was the last King of the Funk and a Musical Genius. His Music touched on so many themes,feeling,stylings and vibes. he was a one of a kind Artist."
4,Amazing synthesis,Not a page turner but a breathtaking work of synthesis. Fresh insights on Atlantic-world history in every chapter.
2,HEADS UP! Only contains Zechariah & Malachi,"Seems like a great commentary but I was looking for Habakkuk and this only contains Zechariah & Malachi. I hate to rate it bad but want to warn people before they purchase a spendy book like this.Fortunately, Amazon allows returns so I'm sending it back."
3,Good for those who want to make a career switch.,"This book addresses its audience well, but everyone else may be disappointed. A thorough list of jobs that writers can apply for is listed, along with informative definitions and income estimates. The book will not help you apply for any of the listed jobs, however, and one has to wonder about the accuracy of Guiley's information. Surely a journalist in Houston will make more money than one in a rural town. If you love to write and do not know what opportunities are out there for writers, however, then this book is a great place to start."
5,Glorious Sounds from the Angel of Music!,"This is my favorite Christmas Album of all time! It makes you see where Crawford gets his reputation as the Angel of Music! I found the album beautiful, uplifting, and throughly elegantly presented. I could not adore it more. This is a Christmas album that will be playing around my house well into the New Year! The best tracks are O Holy Night, Scarlet Ribbons, and Mary did You know?"
1,Gagging on Scarlet Ribbons,"A friend loaned me this CD because she knew I'd liked Phantom of the Opera when I was 16. In absolute honesty, this has to be the worst Xmas album I've ever heard. Every track is utterly saccharine to the point of being unlistenable. I had to hit the ""skip"" button on my remote around the 20-30 second mark on each. Don't take my word for it...listen to the previews and see if you're not slapping yourself on the forehead.Crawford's horrid ""Scarlet Ribbons"" has to have garnered the attention of the guy who hosts NPR's Annoying Music segment by now. I agree with other reviewers who say this song will bring you to tears...but only from laughter or sheer misery, depending on your bent. If this phantom were caterwauling in my basement, I'd call in the exterminator.If you're planning to listen to this album on your MP3 player, feel free--but for the love of pizza, don't subject anyone within speaker range to this torture."
3,Less annoying than most...,"We got this as a gift and I was less than excited. But, it's a decent toy. The biggest plus is that it is QUIET, even on the loudest setting. It's not overly complex (I am not sure if it would hold the attention of older toddlers). The songs aren't awful (they don't pierce your brain). And, it has become a great distraction during diaper changes.Summary: As toys that sing and make noises go, this one isn't that bad. But, I don't think that it would be that interesting to a 3 year old. My daughter is 14 months, and she pretty much has it mastered."
4,Great bargain,"I was first skeptical of this wireless microphone because of the low price. I was surprised with the overall performance of the mic for its price! Though it has a cheap plastic feel, the broadcast quality and range were good for indoor events. There are a few things that I don't like about it though. The wireless mic has only one channel and requires tuning adjustment before every new use. The wireless mic isn't expandable or shareable; you can only use one of these mics at your events. The provided lavalier mic is pretty cheap. It's too sensitive to wind and it gives the transmitter a hiss. Replacing the mic removes the hiss.Overall, this is a good priced set for a wireless mic."
4,Great microphone,"I was looking for a little portable wireless microphone, and when i saw the price and reviews to this one i knew it would be good. It said it was shipping from Ohio so i thought it wont take that long, but i ordered it on May 29 and it got here June 4 3:00! The microphone at first was turning automatically on and off without me doing anything. So i tried to send it back, then i would have to take the battery out of the receiver and transmitter. I did it with the transmitter but the receiver was stuck and the battery case wouldn't close so i just duck taped it on. I left the kit just sitting there on the table for about 5 or 6 hours, and now it works perfectly! RECOMMENDED."
1,Very elementary and outdated,"If you are an adult and interested in state of art computer technology, please DO NOT BUY this video. A grade 5-8 student could have given it a 5 star rating in 1995-97.total run time : 20 Minutes."
4,A great introduction to computers,This video is a wonderful introduction (although a little outdated) to understanding computers. I highly recommend it for a teaching tool in an introductory computer course.
1,Janky,"Not impressed at all. Very bad fit on gun, fits loosely and not uniform. Scratches gun barrel when putting on, which it barely will stay on. Save your $20, avoid!"
5,An all-time-favorite,Antonie Kamerling is GREAT as Chris. Every time I show this film I am told by the people present that they are completely taken by this film. It can be difficult to sit through bacause of the manipulative way Chris is treated... but it is a frightening look into shady characters of the under-world.... It`s daring... it`s haunting... it`s great...
3,"dated, but still good","A little bit dated, but still a good movie with a surprising plot. Found the story interesting untill the end, and that doesn't happen often ... RIP Antonie Kamerling"
4,Street of Dreams...,"I must admit, I wasn't ready for the interpretation(s) that are contained on this album. At first, I was a little disappointed, then I listened to the album again, and again. It was 18 years between ""Every Home should have One"" and ""Street of Dreams"". Ms. Austin still has it (in droves!). I must hand it to her, she handles the material very well! Four stars!!"
4,A S Q U A N I,"THE DARK ISLAND---181 PAGES,NO PICTURES.1995.ROBERT J.CONLEY-CHEROKEE- OKLA.WRITER B-1940.A most cataclysmic era in CHEROKEE history.Book is about ASQUANI a young Indian man --the son of a formerIndian slave who was raped by a Spanish soldier--later the womanmarries a important Cherokee man.Asquani knows he will never be important because of his Spanishheritage-so he leaves his home in search of a Spanish settlement.He finds the SPANISH are a very CREUL PEOPLE. Even their priests.Will he survive this adventure ? Will he ever see his home/familyagain?bbpokc ok63retired"
3,Massively inaccurate,"The interviews are compelling, but you really have to wonder about how accurate even they are considering the glaring errors in this book:Greg Sacks won the Firecracker 500. There has never been a Firecracker 500; it's the Firecracker 400.Gary Bettenhausen injured in a ""spring car"" race. Should be Sprint Car.Gil de Ferran winning 100 Indy Car wins for Penske and Rusty Wallace winning 55 stock car races for him. Poor sentence structure; A number of drivers got Penske to 100 Indy Car wins, and Rusty won 55 races in all, but not all of them with Penske.The list goes on. Amateur mistakes."
5,Excellent book,There are far too many stories from the living that are yet untold. We will hear the stories of the ones who perished when we meet them in heaven. Do not forget. God Bless America.
3,"Compelling narrative, less-than-stellar delivery","Not to undermine the accomplishments and bravery of Ms. Gut, but I found the tone of her memoir a little self-congratulatory in places, yet delivered in a ""What, little old me, a hero?"" voice that didn't feel authentic.I am certainly a cynic, but the story didn't read as though Ms. Gut felt simply compelled to share it, rather, I felt as though she is searching for recognition for all that she has done. She certainly deserves it, but that kind of gratitude shouldn't have to be asked for.I haven't read many holocaust narratives, and it may be that I am more familiar with stories by the ""rescued"" than the ""rescuer"" perspective, but I feel sure that there must be other stories that are equally important, yet more elegantly written."
5,"Excellent and original story, but so, so sad.","Anything involving the Holocaust is extremely heart wrenching, but this story was so original. There was adventure, despair, hope, and courage all surrounding the extraordinary young woman whom we follow throughout. If you're looking for a new story based in WWII and you like a strong female lead, this is for you."
5,It splits wood,"Well made, holds an edge, good weight, and it splits wood. Used it to help ""grind"" down the remains of a stump of a prized tree a freak storm took down (want to be able to plant something there to take its prime-in-the-yard-location). Didn't know how well the other choices would hold up (although I used it in conjunction with another no-name wedge I had that held up fine too). Have to confess I'm a huge Estwing fan, must have about a dozen of their hammers and an ax as well collected over the last forty years, most with the leather grips."
4,Good Movie...BUT,"The movie was good, let's face it Anthony Hopkins don't do bad movies and I think Brad Pitt is gorgous but Pitt's character (Tristan) was a bit too consistent. Come on, everyone on earth is a contradiction of who the are and Tristan should have been as well. But that's what make it a Hollywood movie. Anyway the movie was worthy seeing, go see it."
5,Legends of the Fall,One of my very favorite movies! Brought me back to my high school days. (That's when movie came out) My girlfriends and I swooned over Brad Pitt! :) Super fast shipping!
2,Corn,"Looks promising at first but quickly degenerates into overblown, romance novel style ridiculousness. Brad Pitt's character is especially laughable - a free spirited wildman who ties back his ponytail, enlists to fight in WWI, and cuts the heart out of a dead German soldier."
1,SUCKS!,"I love Brad Pitt & he looks hot in this movie, but itSUCKS! It is so drawn out & the girl in this movieis an idiot!If you want to be bored to tears, then rent thismovie!Zero stars!"
2,did nothing at all for me,"California does have a fascinating history and this book does cover it all. Problem is the writing. The author's not a bad writer but he's not a great one either. I felt my eyes glaze over especially on passages about politics.Given I've enjoyed a number of books on California, it's definitely not me. Maybe someone else can put a finger on it but I just grew weary of the style of writing which came across as too matter of fact and lacking in verve, color, whatever you call it."
3,GROUP PHYSICALS,A glimpse of group male physical examinations during earlier war time periods. Most gay guys would be pleased to see what was going on in those days and how embarassing it was!
1,Nextel is the Problem,"Nextel is the worse company do deal with, no flexibility and all they care about is their contract. I have dealt with Cingular and Verizon both and they both a lot better."
5,Writer? Christian? You'll love it!,"This book is a hidden jewel. The writer takes you on a journey in his life as he finds and applies different written prayers, and tells you the results of praying that certain prayer that week. It is a weekly devotional, and I read it on Saturdays, and it always draws me closer to the Lord."
5,Pot and lids organized,"I got new pots and pans this was a great study, strong way to keep lids and pans organized and easy to reach. I loved that there were more than enough hooks."
3,eh...alright....but...,"Eh, this game was ok. It became a little repetitive in the story mode, what with swarms of covenant attacking you. And yet...the AI was a little buggy....most of the time, they did not even notice that I was there. But, the best thing i have found is the Multi Player. Multi player is probably the best thing from the /entire/ game. But other than that. eh...it needs some work. Halo 2 was suppost to fix this, but it left people still wanting. I would still play Unreal Tournament 2K4 than Halo. Unreal looks better, playes faster on my G4 Al Powerbook (VRAM + RAM maxed), and has faster game play. Overall, it is a good game, but it still needs some fine tuning."
4,One if the Best,"When I heard Halo was coming out for Mac i was syched, this was going to be one of the biggest releases for the Mac ever,and i was right Halo is One of the best Mac titles ever released. Story plot is excellent graphics are great the game is fun the multiplayer is good but there is a lot of lag. I run it on a G4 1.25 GHZ 140 gb HD with a ATI Radeon 9200 and it works fine. And i dont know what some people are talking about with problems with game requirments..i just bought a 1.25GHz PowerPC G4 256MB DDR333 SDRAM 80GB Ultra ATA driveSuperDrive ATI Radeon 9200 i souped it up thought with a 140 GB HD and 1 GB DDR333 SDRAM. I already had halo before i got my computer...i popped that game in before any thing else and it worked smoother that any game before. I'v used about 40 gb of psace on my hd and it still runs like magic. The person with the G5 2 ghz i dont no what the problem is."
5,SWEET!,"This game is amazing! I love the game(especially online multiplayer). They say it is a high end system only game but not always. I turned down the settings to low and some even at medium and I was playing it on a Powerbook G4 800mhz! On my G5( I use macs, windows sucks) I play this game for hours daily due to it's greatness. I love this game so much I just picked up a copy for xbox. I highly reccomend this game, its worth the money."
3,"If You Love Mediocrity, This Game Is For You!!!","Halo for the Mac is an okay game if you like repititious single-player games reminiscent of the very first Doom. The multiplayer is very buggy despite the 1.0.4.1 patch which should have allowed me to play with PC-users...NOT!!! But not all is bad, Halo is a beautiful game, especially if you have a 64Mb or higher graphics card, and the story is decent being flavored by hard science-fiction elements like the halo itself (aka Larry Niven's RINGWORLD) and the in-game physics of running and operating are very realistic!However, if you're looking for heart-pounding, adrenaline-inducing, edge-of-your-seat fragfest multiplayer action, I highly recommend Unreal 2k3 and 2k4, or wait for Doom 3 if you're a purist for single-player shooter games."
2,Meh,"The cover of the book appealed to me, and I love chick lit, but this book was basically just a summary of a few well known chick lit books, and really with no further insight. I think the author had enough good content for a pamphlet, the rest was... meh."
5,Excellant,Excellant commentary. Readable and the proper fit for all types of studies or for preaching. Would highly reccommend to all.
1,Not too smooth,"I had a difficult time reading this book. It didn't inspire me in the least. I am a person who has always enjoyed writing. I chose another profession, which includes writing contracts. I have been thinking about writing fiction for a long time and that is why I purchased this book. The book basically states that if you haven't gone to school for writing then you can't be a writer. Not very encouraging. Too many ""BIG"" words. Not easy to read at all. If I picked up a novel written by this author, I probably wouldn't finish it!"
3,Wordy - not very helpful,"For fans of John Gardner or experienced writers who might enjoy an articulate critique of their craft, this book is fine. But for a ""young writer"" looking for guidance its value is questionable.It reads like a narcissistic tribute from a self-satisfied college professor who likes to hear himself speak. There are plenty of other books available dealing with the fundamentals of writing that should prove far more helpful for beginners."
3,Not for young writers,"This book contained some fascinating insights into the art of writing fiction, but frankly, I thought it was written very poorly(!). I did not flow at all and read much like some of the worst textbooks I've seen. He obviously has read a wide variety of books, but he assumes the reader is familiar with them.I think this may be a good book for English majors or experienced writers, but not for young writers. For us young and inexperienced writers, he talks above our heads.Even the style can scare a person away. He writes in the style of John Smith and others who could fit maybe one paragraph on a page. It's just not conducive to digesting the material.In short, if you're a young writer, go trying ""Writing Fiction Step By Step"" by Josip Novakovich or something like that. But experienced writers, you may enjoy this."
2,One of my favorites ruined by an incredibly poor transfer,"Enchanted April has long been one of my favorite films. I have long anticipated its release on DVD. Unfortunately I am very disappointed by the results.Without any hesitation I can say this is the worst transfer of a film to DVD I have ever seen. Scratches, dust, etc which result from the poor quality of the transfer ruin the viewing experience of this very fine film. It is incredible that a studio would put out such a poor transfer and expect the public to pay for it. Shame on them!Mike"
4,Enjoyable second time round,"Bought this dvd again recently after watching Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and deciding to pick up a couple of past videos that I had enjoyed as much for their scenery as for anything else.I had been years since I watched it and although it took them longer to get to Italy than I was remembering, I loved the ""opening of the windows"" scene the first morning after they arrived ... for the scenery.Good movie with some stellar actresses in it .. happy to watch it again with friends when they want to."
5,The VHS and the audio CD!!!!!,"This is a great film for those dreary western Montana winter days. The sun is shining in Italy. The flowers are blooming. The friendships that evolve for the four women is a joy to watch. And Mr. Wilkins in the bath, well if you don't giggle......"
5,At last! The DVD!,"At last! The DVD will soon be available! We have been waiting so long. I've been making do with a worn out VHS with garbled sound in places. But I still watch it, because this movie is lovely. The setting, the casting, the story...it all comes together and the ultimate result is close to perfection."
2,Of mild interest only,"Cool World is a very disappointing film. While the concept is interesting, the execution leaves much to be desired."
2,one liner,"I only rmember one thing from the entire movie that I just sat thru.One toon calls another ""pencil d##k"". I laughed and laughed. Then I went back into my coma. Not a very good movie at all."
1,Jack Black is the only reason one should watch this,"What a horrible piece of film history. I'm not even a big fan of ""Fantasia"" or this series, but even I felt betrayed. It has nothing to do with the first two despite the appearance of Atreyu (who in this incarnation is played by Jason James Richter - i guess the money was too low for someone the caliber of jonathan brandis) i digress. even the creatures are cheesy. there is no spark of imagination like the first two in the way the creatures act or talk much of it relies only on pathetic one liners. the plot is also sad. like i said, the only reason to watch this is to see jack black, one of the finest comedians of our time. thanks for your time."
1,"So terrible, selling it in stores is criminal","Just look at this, about 10 minutes in you know just how terrible this is. Why even sell this if it does much more harm and absolutely no good? If you ever come across this in a store or flee market, DESTROY IT! Stomp the tape or bend the disk in half. They may demand you to pay for the damage or arrest you, but it's well worth the risk because THIS MOVIE IS CRIMINAL. Just say ""It must be destroyed before it does more damage to other people who are unfortunate enough to fall for this. Anyone who just watched the first movie and moved on to this, it can drive them mentally insane enough to be strapped to a chair in a mental institution (which is where those directors and producers belong)."
3,We all get a little nasty,All in all if we all use our imagination this movie is pretty colerful. Unlike the the first 2 stories it is not based off the book. This movies however has a message and one scene really got me to realize it. We all get a little nasty sometimes and you got to learn to fight the nasty so you dont get so upset at everything. I liked the movie and would watch it again.
1,Beating a dead horse!,"After seeing this movie, I said...""why?"" I personally think that the incredible debut should have been laid to rest...nothing like it will ever be made again. There are some movies that are so incredible that should be left alone, and Neverending Story was one of these. Yes, even though it's named ""Neverending.""Instead of accurately continuing with such a great story and making sequels that follow the 80's culture and movie making style, they decided to make this doorstop. (Which is pretty much all it's good for)."
1,Not even remotely like the original two,"OK, I own all three of these movies, and this is a poor attempt at the magic of the original. While the original was both a cool acchievment in special FX and story telling, this reduces the entire story to junk. Where is Atrayu? When did the Rockbiter become Russian! And where did the empress's mystique go? Now she is just some teen in a Princess Leia dress with a silver necklace in her hair. And I didn't know that the Orin gave you a credit card! What tripe! I hope that the Hasting's Bad Movie group adds this to the worst films ever list."
3,I Want The Orin,"I let my children watch this because it's still got that adventure. It also has many fun characters and a morale to the story.It was great to see Jack Black early in his career as an actor. He's as awesome an actor as he was back then, only healthier. I recommend it for the kiddies."
5,Deeply moving imagery,"Here is poetry that is spare yet incredibly rich and fulfilling. I found myself going back for more and more, with every reading revealing new morsals to savor. Yet there's not an extra or weak word to be found: each poem is crafted to deliver just enough. There are poems here that lovers should read to each other; others need to be savored in a quiet space, alone. This volume needs to be by everyone's bedside and in everyone's backpack when communing with nature."
2,Israel History,"As a student of Israel's history and that of World Wars I & II, I found this less beneficial than most of the books I have read in the past year."
3,exhaust tips,"These are very nice tips but the only thing I found wrong with them is the screws to tighten them on to the tail pipe are not very long or sturdy enough.When I tried to tighten the screw to tighten it on, it stripped out.Having bigger and thicker screws would help."
5,Whole new mind transforms a college,"Be very, very careful with whom you share this video because it can change how people view the work place and their lives. This is an excellent introduction to Dan Pink's ideas about what will be valued in the near future and why it is important to grasp the concepts now.Also, a word of warning - make certain that the local library has a copy because once folks know that you have it, they'll want to view it and share it with their peers."
4,An integral and concrete visiÃ³n about the new competences,"Sincerly, i was expecting more, how ever, I had almost one hour really focus on his concepts and reflecting about it.It present a hipotesis about the new competences that the new markets will demand. Their concepts are simple, with basis (in some way bias)and innovative.If you want to think about your actual competences, your thinking style and probabilities about what the world will demand, it is a very good sesion"
2,Doesn't always work,"We have a 2-year old who can open all doors with ease. We put on these covers to stop her from wandering outside without our knowledge and she promptly openned the door with the protective cover on it.It does slow her down in opening the door, but she can still do it rather consistently."
4,pretty well satisfied,"i bought a bunch of these when my son starting waking up before us and wandering downstairs. that was over 2 years ago. although on occassion he has managed to open one of these, it was NEVER a regular occurance. We now have a daughter, almost 2, and have just moved into a new house. These have been one of the first things unpacked and put to use. Too bad they don't work on the newer lever door handles, as we have them too.if you have problems with your child opening the door with one of these on, try to make sure that the gripping bit are parallel to the floor. this should make it harder for little hands AND easier for you!"
2,Something to consider,"While these do make it a little bit trickier for a toddler to turn the door knob, there is a large hole in front so that you can still access the door lock. The problem is that children can also access the lock...We have one on the door that goes out to our garage, and when I stepped out to take out the trash, my son pushed the button and locked me out of the house! Fortunately we have a spare key outside, but thought I would pass this along as something to consider if you have a child that is fascinated with buttons. There is another style available through One Step Ahead that completely covers the door knob and locking mechanism."
2,Elevator music,"I understand where everybody else is coming from when they say that Soulive has good musicianship and songwriting skills but this album is completely devoid of emotion. All the little unison sax/keys licks seem to be floating around in the songs for no reason. It sounds like the kind of stuff that you hear on an elevator when you go to work. Also, I like Dave Mathews, but on Joyful Girl, he's terrible, probably because it's was a terrible song to begin with(it's an Ani DiFranco cover). The other lyrics just don't seem to cut it either(sorry Black Thought) because they don't fit in with this style of jazz. My sugestion is if you want good groovy organ jazz, stick to Medeski, Martin, and Wood, it's miles better than this."
1,Did not last 1 month,"Purchased this fast-wrap band as a replacement. The band looked amazing and was a great fit....but within a month, the rubber pull-tab's stitching separated from the nylon backed velcro. It is now useless. I have since purchased a simple, black fast-wrap one from Wal-mart for $8 and it works great."
5,Soulful Falsetto,"The Invincibles never had a lot of records released, probably because the mimiced the Impressions and Curtis Mayfield. This record (with overdubbed strings etc)represents the bulk of the output of a soulful group and lead singer who sang high notes with strong delivery in the realm of Curtis Mayfield, Eddie Kendricks and Eddie Holman. The songs are strong as doo wop goes. There are only 7 or 8 songs but they are worth hearing to a doo wop fan. Rollo."
1,Pemsleur's Russian II Audio Cassette,You have a serious problem with the Pemsleur Russian II Audio Cassette. You have the author as mary carroll. The mary carroll book is a romance novel and you have sent it tpo me three times and I have sent it back or was told to not return the book. Get a grip on this situation. The catalog number is a mess. Please correct this inefficiency.
4,Good but only short version of another,"As everyone will agree, this is a good book in valuation tools. With different version of the DCF models, this book is one of the ideal desk reference of security analysis. However, if you also look at the book ""Investment Valuation"" by Professor Damodaran, you will agree that this one is only a short version of ""Investment Valuation"". Almost every topic is covered (or copied) from ""Investment Valuation"".I gave ""Investment Valuation"" a 5-star rating. So, for its short version, I give 4-star."
5,a dark retelling,"Matthew Maguire's modern update of the Racine tale of forbidden love is a titillating and powerful language driven piece. Maguire's heroes now inhabit the dark canyons of Wall Street, using junk bonds and sexual power plays as their weapons of choice. The piece loses none of the grandeur of the original material while making it accessible to modern sensibilities."
3,The larger etch a sketch is better,"It is difficult to see the lines and to erase the lines. While easy to carry around and nice for a small child, it really does not work as well as the large one."
1,S**t Sandwich,Shri Durga is an exploration into the ego of Dj Cheb i Crappathat serves a dieuretic for the mind. The ragas are marvelous but theelectronics are half baked and offensive to the Pakistani communities who have seen a pure traditional art perversed. YUK!
3,Not just groovalicious,"I was relieved to hear that the 4/4 club rhythms have been applied very selectively on this album. In fact, it's much closer to a listening album than a proper dance album. In most cases, the original performances are enhanced (as the Amazon reviewer says, ""prismatically"") by the electronics. Each track is intended to portray a ""divine pastime"" as well as a mood or emotion; Cheb i Sabbah's third goal is to unite Hindu and Muslim traditions within the umbrella of Hindustani music. Samples of ritual chanting and holy festivals help achieve this aim and also provide ambiance. This disc is an apt overview of North Indian vocal styles in a postmodern context, and its feeling is more erotic and meditative as opposed to simply groovalicious."
1,Stupid as it gets,"This is the most idiotic movie based on a great movie, Avatar, I've yet seen. The trailers made it seem better than it actually was. I only watched about 20 min then turned it off. It was so crappy, I could not stand to watch any more. This goes back to the stupid alien movies of the 50's but at least they had some substance. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone and it should be removed from your inventory. . . . . especially having to PAY for it."
1,Aliens vs Avatars,This movie is a piece of junk....had to stop every 15-20 minutes and take a break...only think worth watching is 4 of 5 hot women in the movie....can't wait to trade this POS in.
3,Unimpressive,"A well told story but that somehow left me with a feelingof emptyness. Rather unsatisfying.Yes, I found it in the fantasy section of my localbookstore and yes, it is written by Gene Wolfe, butI did not find much of the classical elements of thefantasy genre in the book. It is in fact quiterealistic.A little village is torn apart between a ruthlessbandit and the king's men, but a good point of the storyis that it keeps teasing thereader into wondering who really are the good guys and who arethe bad guys of the story. Is this a romantic,Robin Hood-like type of outlaw? This situation is resolved atthe end."
2,"SAME OLD, SAME OLD","If you own many CD's by Judy Collins you may be very disappointed in this one. It is just more of the same old music. There is nothing fresh and new about this CD. Judy sings more Bob Dylan, traditional folk music, MORNING HAS BROKEN, AMAZING GRACE, and CATS IN THE CRADLE once again. Judy tries something new with combining John Denvers LEAVING ON A JET PLANE with COUNTRY ROADS in a medley, which was a bit different. The band on this album plays very well but has a tendency to hold out the last notes of each song expecting Judy to hold her last note longer; but she never does. Judy also growls a few notes on this one. My suggestion is stick to the old Judy Collins recordings."
5,sunscreen,This is the only sunscreen product I have been able to get my husband to wear. He complained the other ones would drip in his eyes when he sweat. This goes on dry and stays on.
5,great,they are great this make so wonderful candy and other things love them so so somuch they will work great
4,Moves right along.....,"The venue is post war Germany. There's lots of action and you don't want to put the book down. Reich does really develop the 2 main characters and you get to look through the eyes of both rather than just the good guy's. The bad guy is shown to be a cat of 9 lives with incredible survival skills. I would have given it 5 stars but the ""flash back"" device was a little over-used, IMHO. I read this on Kindle and there were only a couple of typo's .Very well prepared for Kindle reading. I'm on my way now to order another Christopher Reich book."
2,Read better.,"The story is Okay. At times predictable and the last few pages are peppered with spelling mistakes which i find very unprofesional. Slow at times. If the time period interests you and you are not looking for a fast paced read, go for it."
2,The Trashing of an American Hero,"Mr. Reich could have written an excellent story concerning the immediate aftermath of the war in Europe, however he spends most of the book making Gen. Patton a traitor and common murderer. His attempt to take Patton's warnings about the intent of the Soviets and the need to push them out of Eastern Europe (we might ask some of those left behind the iron curtin if Patton was correct) have been converted to his being a traitor, this is going to far, unfortunatly the courts have ruled that you cannot slander the dead."
2,steamy fluff,"This is a fluffy tale of immature lust disguised as love. The plot is a shallow excuse for steam and heat. Lance was a dud as a love interest and the females were stereotyped and one-dimensional. All the interactions were adolescent. I didn't see the humor others mentioned in their reviews. I downloaded this because of the great reviews and was reminded why I usually avoid this type of novel. If you like Harlequin romances and sex scenes, you'll like this. If you're looking for a romance or realistic love story, keep looking."
2,Sleeping in Wixom,"I'm sorry everyone, this book didn't do it for me. You have a strong independent woman in lust with a wimpy man. Wimpy because he doesn't want to be with Sophia (strong lady) because he doesn't want to get married??? There was no hint that Sophia wanted marriage. But then somewhere in the middle of the book he wants to be with Sophia and is Mr. Romantic. I just wasn't into it. I like those books where the funny strong lady banters with the funny strong man and there was none of that in this story. Definitely no humor. Hence why I gave it only 2 stars."
2,"Whine, whine, whine","Yeah, there is a lot wrong in America; the powerful do take advantage of the weak. I would have liked some perspective though rather than just a whining account.Bob Herbert can do better than this. It sounds like a disgruntled Co-op board. Since the issues are much more serious an attempt at integrating the problem or recounting it with what should happen in America would be in order. The question begs, ""Is America all in our minds?"""
4,finally,"This is probably my favorite troubleshooters book yet. I think because we already know Sam & Alyssa so well and have been rooting for them for so long. I absolutely loved the backstory on Sam. I already loved Sam, but this book helped me know and love Ringo and Roger too. As always, Jules was great. The Gina/Max story is very compelling. The anxiety level was high, but it was as a little difficult to believe that Sam's head could be anywhere other than 150% on finding his child. I accidentally skipped the previous book and went back and read it after the fact. Skipping that book actually amped up the suspense of this one. Had I read them in order, I dont know that I would have liked it quite as much. All in all a good read. The WW2 story doesnt add much."
4,Gone Too Far,"This is the first book of Suzanne Brockmann that I came across at. The beginning was a little boring, but afterwards, the story got more and more exciting. I like the way the story is written - the suspense was great, the characters are fabulous, and overall, I'm very plesantly surprised w/ the impressive way this book was written. Of course this is my first encounter w/ the NAVY SEALS so everything felt so new and original. I'll definitely go check out her other books, and see if there is originality in every book that's written."
3,After a long wait...disappointed,"I have been waiting for the story of Sam and Alyssa for 2 years! The glimpses of their relationship have been some of the best parts of SB's other books and finally, she wrote their story. I was so disappointed. Sam's character suddenly turned so sensitive that he wasn't recognizable and the ""Ringo"" storyline was boring. I would have been happy to wait longer for this book to be published, in return for a solid story. Every loose end was so conveniently tied up, it became tedious! Right down to Mary Lou gushing ""I'm getting married too!"".I am a big Suzanne Brockmann fan. My favorites are Over The Edge and Into the Night - probably because of the foreplay to Sam and Alyssa's relationship! I wish that SB had taken more time to write this book - it had the potential to be fantastic."
1,Finally I finished it!!,"I have to congratulate the rest of the reviewers that have ploughed their way through this entire series. I read one before this ""Defiant Hero"" and that's enough for me, thank you. It is hard to believe a writer could drag out a story that takes place in 1 week folks, check the dates, but the way she did this was to sandwich in all the childhood trauma of Roger/Sam and the letter writing between Dot and Walt. She not only filled us in on all the background but kept beating us over the head with it. And talk about sexual hangups these characters had them all. At least any more in this series will have a change of pace you can hope since there are some career changes taking place, and maybe everyone will get lucky and Max will go off to Kenya and do some real adjusting."
2,Yuchhh!!!,"Last one I'll read by her.I didn't like the last book. But, I had to read this book after living with Sam and Alyssa for years.I liked MarylouI didn't care about Tom and Kelly.Needless to say, I was ready to throw the book before the first 100 pages."
4,Use to be great but not so anymore,This socks use to be the best quality. The sock feel comfortable and fit well. My issue is that this sock don't last long. I am wearing a pair of socks that are less then 3 months old which with socks have big holes in them. They will be going in the trash. These socks are $$$ so they should last longer. They use to last long but I they changed something. I am very disappointed as this were my favorite.
3,great sound,"This cd has great sound. However, I listened to it once and the desire to hear it again is minimal."
5,A Family Favorite,"My husband saw this while we were Christmas shopping for our boys. He commented that he played it at a friend's house when he was a kid and he had loved it. So, I went back later and bought it for him for Christmas. It has quickly become the family favorite. We got a stack of board games for Christmas but this is the one everyone keeps coming back to. It is simple but fun. It requires thought and strategy. My boys absolutely love it."
4,Kendo And Iaido Vol. 2 Review,This dvd was much better than Vol. 1 which suffered from audio difficulties. I found the demonstrations to be very well executed and explained in great detail.This dvd would be an excellent aid to augment regular instruction and training
5,I Have A Poisonous Asp!,"If the above title has you chuckling, this is the movie for you! A spoof of Anthony & Cleopatra done in the inimitable Carry On style. Jim Dale & Kenneth Connor as the heroic Ancient Brits, Sid James as the asp-chomping Mark Anthony, and Bernard Bresslaw as Agrippa the bodyguard are all classic characters. My personal favourite Carry On. They don't make 'em like this any more!"
3,"""I'm Gonna Hire a Wino"" alone is worth the price of the CD","This CD is a pretty good hodgepodge of 80s country hits, but it gains points because it contains a few songs that are difficult to find elsewhere - ""Party Time"" and especially ""I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home."" The latter has been MIA for much of the CD era, at least the original recording. The David Frizzell hits collections out there today unfortunately include only a later re-recording that just can't match the original. So if you are looking for this classic honky-tonker, this CD will do just fine."
3,I&#65533;m up for a free lunch,"An essay by Philippe Van Parijs begins this book, in which he proposes that all citizens above the age of 16 be given a Universal Basic Income unconditionally. I must say that I've found this idea very fascinating for the past few years, but never thought seriously about it. The fifteen replies to Van Parijs' essay provide various perspectives on the political and economic feasibility of the plan, as well as on issues of justice and fairness.The problem of this book lies in its very virtue of being a short, easy read that introduces the reader to what is considered a radical policy proposal. And this is that it doesn't provide much in the way of analysis beyond what one might read in a newspaper. Of course, there is a problem in being too academic: few people might read it, and the idea may not spread (though I doubt it will spread far anyway). Still, it's a fun concept to think about."
3,"Cheap, but functional","These have cheaply made all over them, but they seem to do the job, and cost little. I do appreciate their simple design. Sometimes they have opened up on me, especially when they drop on a table, and I've had to re-thread them with the cords of the blind. Thus the 3 stars."
3,deja vu !!,"Listen to this disk a time or two, and you'll find yourself thinking- ""where have I heard this before??"" I don't know if it was done intentionally or not, but this guy sounds just like George Benson. If that's the case, then I have to say- get your own style!! While most of the album is good, I tired of it quickly, probably because it irritates me to think he had the idea- ""well, if it worked for George Benson, then maybe it will for me."""
3,Under a New Title,"SEE: Chronic Illness and the Twelve Steps: A Practical Approach to Spiritual Resilience by Martha Cleveland, PH.D."
3,A Well-Written Story,"""Alone at the Summit"" is an enjoyable read. The first 1/3 is a little slow, but I was totally drawn in as Venables and his team mates move up the mountain. Venables includes a history of Himalayan climbing at the back. The history is interesting and provides good perspective for understanding both the philosophy behind this 1988 expedition and its historical context.If you like to read climbing expedition books, I recommend that you read ""Alone at the Summit."""
1,Big disappointment,I want the return of my money. Amazon should review what the sellers are selling through Amazon. First the audio was bad and the contents are boring. I didn't even finish the video. It's a waste.
4,Grew our personal relationship with God,We did this as a 6 week summer Bible Study (two chapters a week). We met in the evening at different public locations and prayed and discussed the study guide questions. All of us REALLY enjoyed the study! It has made us want to have a more intimate relationship with our Lord. We feel convicted and rejuvenated.
3,Mistaken Identity,I ordered the wrong book by mistake for a women's bible study group. They wanted another book by the same author. I now have several copies of this book. :)
2,Trying to Get Into It: Redundant,I bought this book at a retreat because the title spoke to me. I am a full-time engineer who struggles to find a way to carry God into each work day while still focusing on the hard work at hand. It's been very hard to get into this book because the author repeats herself again and again. There are just too many rehashings of the same thought about Martha's frustration with Mary. I try not to jump ahead in books but with this one I've started skimming to get to the ideas to apply to my own life. I will continue to try this book and come back with a final review.
3,"An Important Message, but Redundant","The author has addressed a subject that targets real-life character issues and is important for our growth in Christ-likeness. I am glad that so many women find this book helpful (based on the other reviews). However, I thought the writing was very redundant and found myself skimming a lot of the text."
4,Very good book:,Would recommend this to any small ladies group or bible study. Thisreally teaches you about Martha and Mary and puts you in their shoes.
3,Good but not the best.,"We see this book in a group Bible Study. We had already done a few other women's Bible Studies, some we liked and others we did not. This was better than ""Bad Girls of the Bible"" but not as good a ""Lineage of Grace"". I found several times that I just did not think the questions were relevant. It seemed like we could not relate to the authors point of view in some cases. It was however, well written and there was nothing that I found to be incorrect.We did consider going on to the next book. However, in the end concluded that the style was not for our group. This has the feel of a self-help or improvement book. That is a good thing but what our group is looking for is a deeper knowledge of scripture. If you want self improvement then I highly recommend these books. However, if your group is more focused on study for the sake of knowledge and understanding alone then you will not feel like these books apply."
5,A Great Reminder,"This book is a fresh and welcome reminder that the Lord desires us to be at His feet so that we might hear what it is that He is teaching us. In a ""Martha"" stewart world, we can ""get in trouble"" if we spend all of our time in service and not enough time resting at the instruction of the Lord. She chose the better of the two. We need to choose to make ourselves still before Him, and this book is wonderfully set up to help us do just that! Thank you, Joanna!Kelly J. TownsendAuthorChrist Centered Childbirth"
1,American Knitter's Round Knitting Loom Instructional How to Knit DVD,"It was not what I was expecting. I got more information on loom knitting by watching YouTube videos made by people like myself. I was also annoyed about the fact they wasted the time to add a section on regular knitting. If I wanted to know about regular knitting, I would have bought a DVD on regular knitting. It seemed clear to me that based on what they demonstrated and the lame projects they showed, they really didn't have much of a grasp of what the loom can do. Overall, I was very disappointed."
3,"Confused, got better",I was not happy when I got the first one as it didn't work. I never heard back from anyone till one day I received another one. That one does work. I was very happy to finally get one that did work. I was just wondering why I never heard anything from the seller. But it all work out just fine.
5,One of Yellowman's last great albums.,"This 1987 release from Yellowman was very good. Whereas Yellowman had literally ruled the Jamaican dancehall music scene during the early 1980s he was now facing serious competition from others who were finding fame and success in the dancehall genre. The opening track (""Budget"") is both a lamentation of Jamaica's then-current economic problems and a sobering example of relevant social commentary. While it is true that Yellowman's popularity would ,by the late 1980s, decline considerably it is also true that his 1981-1987 recordings were extremely popular and influential and their influence is still felt today."
5,Outstanding film,Do not believe Tom Keough's somewhat negative review given with this DVD. He watched on VHS: maybe that was the problem.In my opinion this is Zhang Yimou' best work -- certainly the most memorable and most exciting. Gong Li is brilliant. Compares well with Godfather I as among the best in the gangster genre. The old triad leader is the scariest on film.
4,Great games in a great book,"This book is terrific! It has so many card games in it and it provides many hours of fun! Some of the games included on how to play are Pinochle, Euchre, Canasta, Bridge, Poker, Rummy, Hearts, and many, many more! There is also a section on Family and Children card games. The instructions are clear and concise. Buy this book, it's so worth the money!"
2,Overrated,"I don't understand all the acclaim for this book. It raises a few interesting issues and provides a little information on race and gender relations in the pre-Civil War south, but that's all. As far as the story of Celia herself goes, the author provides remarkably little detail. In fact, I have never read any ""history"" with so many admissions that the author doesn't know the facts. Instead, he repeatedly speculates on what likely happened after admitting there is no evidence on the point. And as far as the broader picture of slavery goes, most of it is pretty cusory and often it is simplistic. Still, I give it two stars instead of one for the few interesting points and because the underlying story of Celia is both important and interesting."
3,Celia deserved to have her story grip you from beginning to end.,"This story should have been one that grips you from beginning to end instead of a chore to wade through. Many names and dates and events could easily have been left out. I love history and usually appreciate a picture of what's going on on all fronts throughout the story, but I'm sorry to say here it seemed tedious and unnecessary."
4,Great little speaker system,"I love this little speaker set. It fits great anywhere in my office and is mobile enough for me to take to the office. As far as the sound is concerned, it is a little ""tinny."" But, for the price, I get exactly what I need. The extras are great and include a car adapter and the ability to charge your shuffle while it's hooked into the system. And the folks who bought this present for me had not troubles with delivery of the product."
1,Does not charge iPod Shuffle,"I bought this product to play ""white noise"" on my iPod Shuffle while sleeping at night.Contrary to what's mentioned in some other reviews, the speakers I received did not charge my iPod Shuffle. I could only play the Shuffle as long as its battery lasted - only a few hours, not the entire night.I've written to the seller to understand whether I received a defective unit or not, but haven't heard back.So, if you'd like to play music for several hours on your Shuffle, you might want to look for other products. I'm considering the ""Creative TravelSound i50 Speaker Dock for iPod shuffle"", also sold on Amazon."
3,Not bad,"It's not easy to find accessories for the Shuffle so I was glad to find this. The sound quality is so-so. It's OK at lower volume, but there is distortion at higher volume levels. Still, for the money it's not bad."
1,cheap sound.,"I didn't expect much range from the system, but sound was cheaper than expected. 0 mid-range. Size of box allows bigger & better speakers than they put in. Looks neat, since it's made for the mini, but if you want even mildly passable sound, get any of the quality systems that are made to play from any source"
2,Wow! Not much good here!,"If you know the great song ""If"", don't be looking for any other songs nearly as good here!!!! ""Let Your Love Go"" is a good song, and ""Make It With You"" is at least listenable. The rest is pure horrid unlistenable fluff. I thought this band was capable of more.At least it was only 50 cents brand new!"
4,works for me,"Bought it to try a 460cc. Feels great, works even better. Added distance and accuracy to my game. Great club for the money."
4,Affinity Cube driver,"I am a fairly high handicap recreational golfer. I had been using a Calloway X460 before I bought the cube. I had some reservations because Affinity is not a ""big name"" manufacturer. However, I am pleased with my purchase. My analysis is this:Will it dramatically improve your game and add 30 yards to your drive? NoWill it fix a terrible slice? Nohowever, what is will do is improve your accuracy, a lot, on a reasonably well hit shot. For me, it hits about the same distance as my Calloway; however, it is MUCH more forgiving for a off-center shot. I haven't played it yet, but based on my driving range experience, I'm thinking it could be good for 2 or 3 strokes. I'm not convinced it would do a lot of good for a low handicapper who rarely hits the ball 25 yards left or right of where they are aiming, but for us mere mortals, its a pretty good club."
4,big bang for buck!!,"When i purchased this i knew it wasn't the best driver out there, so my expectations weren't that high, however, i was surprised as too the quality of this ""cheap"" driver. I don't play enought golf to justify a $400-$500 driver,This one will put it down the fare way just fine"
1,One's trash is another's treasure,"I suppose the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this is ""Am I a fan of Kurt's legacy, or a fan of Nirvana and the music?"" If you are a fan of the music, you will be appauled and disgusted by this poor excuse for a documentary. If you are simply a fan of Kurt's, and have no respect or regard for the other members of the band, then I suppose I can almost understand why you may enjoy this. In my opinion, I can't even say it was about Nirvana. I can't say much about it except waste of time and money. But others may like it."
2,A disapointment of a movie!,"I was very angry that this pathetic movie could be even associated with a great musician (and person) Kurt Donald Cobain! The people being interviewed did not know what they are talking about! One person said that words to live by were ""I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep WHEN I'm stoned."" Those aren't the even the correct lyrics, it's AND I'm stoned. Another person, instead of saying it correctly: Smells Like Teen Spirit, they said Smells Like TEAM Spirit. It contained nothing about the band or their music, and only showed footage of Aberdeen, WA. The photographer who thought he was god's gift to the world didn't even have a clue what he was talking about! I am extremely disapointed in this movie! END"
1,Not a good way to learn about Nirvana,"For as influential a band as Nirvana was, this film does not seem worthy of their greatness. Many major aspects of Nirvana are not covered, including Kurt's drug problems, the post-Nevermind relationship of the band, and his relationship with Courtney. Furthermore, the documentary contains no actual Nirvana songs. It insults Nirvana fans by having other groups performing their music during the film. If you are just learning about Nirvana, this is not an accurate depiction. Instead I would reccomend ""Live, Tonight, Sold Out"" which is not on DVD yet but seems to capture Kurt's vision. ""Heavier than Heaven"" by Charles Cross is also an excellent resource to really learn about the man behind the music. Overall this DVD is a brief glimpse of some random Nirvana facts that really big fans may find somewhat amusing. Other than that I can think of no appropriate audience for this terrible documentary."
4,The book was interesting but not great,"It was interesting because it included different stories from many different people. It was not great because it was composed of different short stories so I could not get into the book as I would have been able to if I were reading a novel. It had an interesting and fun writing style because it was narrated by a person, and in the narration he told the stories of people he met. Every other chapter is a story, and the ones in between are the narrators reflection on the story and what happens next in the narrators life, before he meets the next person whose story is told in the book. Overall it was a very good book, especially for one assigned for my english class."
1,River Sutra,"As hard as I tried, I could not get into this book. It's just not what I was expecting. It was like something written for a child, maybe it is. JMHO."
1,Propaganda,"This is pretty much the worst book ever written. It is, however, good for kindling for a fire in the winter time. Or, it can be used as fuel for a bon fire in your backyard. This book is filled with propaganda and hate-speech. Just look at the publisher. That should give you an idea of how bad it is."
2,Thank Goodness...,"Thank goodness Christian music is a lot better nowadays than it was in the 90's! It's hard to imagine a time before there was David Crowder, Chris Tomlin, Delirious, Jeremy Camp, Mercy Me, Relient K, Toby Mac, Leeland, Shawn McDonald, and Jars of Clay made the Wow Worship CD's."
1,spyware doctor's customer support is nonexistant,"I purchased the spyware doctor software and the registery mechanic software last week. the charge showed up on my credit card but i have never received a registration number email. when i used their system to send them my problem, i heard nothing. there is no phone number to call when the web report doesn't work. so i am here with a product on my computer i cannot use because it is not registered and i do not know how to reach a real person at this company.A product is only as good as its support system. This one is not good."
1,Version 5 unusable,"As of March 25 I'm having the same experience as others here: SD does catch problems other scanners miss, and can successfully remove some infestations other products do not. However while Ver 4 worked properly, with the real-time protection enabled Ver 5 slowed all three of my fully patched XP SP2 systems to the point where they are unusable, then eventually freezes the system. My advice is that if you MUST use this product to removed a specific infection you enable it for that specific purpose than immediately disable it afterwards."
4,My five year old loves this!,"Jim Weiss's stories are well paced and interesting. Obviously abridged it has provided a good introduction to these stories to my five year old who now has me online looking for more! Mr. Weiss has, in some cases, simplified the language and concepts to ones that my five year old understand. A great tape for car rides, my three year old even loves to listen along."
2,The Three Muskateers for kids? Really?,"If you must get this, get this for Robin Hood. I can explain this to a child. Good vs. Evil very clear.Can apply it to real life situations like politics/government. But The Three Muskateers was a poor choice for this reading. Covering up infidelity of the queen and defending her honor (what honor)? This gets confusing for a child. This is confusing to me! Another story would have been appropriate. We believe that there are consequences for personal actions. Stories can be powerful...we should be more discerning.I speak of myself as well...I was not familiar with this story...I should have checked out what The 3 Muskateers was going to be about before allowing my children to listen."
2,too small for the freezer,I bought it for chest freezer storage. It was much too small. The width didn't make the span. I used it for cleaner storage.
4,a good card reader with bonus USB ports,"I have an old Sandisk card reader which has been working great but just a little bit of slow because it's a USB 1.1. I came across this IOgear one with a reasonable price plus some extra USB ports. I have been using it for about 2 months without any problem. It comes with a power adapter to power the USB ports. Most of the time, I just use the card reader to transfer data. I don't even need to plug-in the power adapter and it works just fine."
1,"Piece of garbage, rarely works.","I've used this both with a PC, and an iMac. It works wonderfully well... SOMETIMES. But most the time, it does not work at all. I can get it work by plugging and unplugging the USB and power cable until something magical happens and it works. It's too bad because it is nice looking and has a lot of features. Mine is going into the garbage tonight though..."
1,Not ready for Vista,"Despite claims on the iogear site to support Vista, this hub and card reader periodically stopped working -- the card reader especially usually required a restart after every use. Repeated e-mails to support have gone unanswered."
1,minus five stars,"This is the first review I have ever done, so here goes.First of all, the title of this movie is all wrong. The movie should be called ""Rednecks Meet Wolfman"".The only redeeming quality of the movie is the Leading Man. He was perfect for the role, the only thing he had to do was brush his body and back hair up over his head, chuck a pair of fangs into his mouth and bingo, Wolfman. Wow, think of all the money they saved by hiring this guy.The person that bought the video camera at Christmas time to make this movie, return it, get a refund, buy something useful, maybe a pair of binoculars. You could search the Skies for shining objects. You could write a book about aliens or little green men meeting the Wolfman.I hope some of this advice is useful to you. I strongly suggest, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE, DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE, DON'T BORROW THIS MOVIE FROM SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT WASTED MONEY ON IT.Here's Your Sign"
1,I expected more for the money....,"From a book of this size and price, I expected more. Cervin Robinson's paperback book ""Skyscraper Style"" has better pictures of many same buildings. Too bad there isn't more info about terra-cotta across the country. Some of the best is out here in the Southwest. Just because most books are published in New York, do they mostly have to be about New York?"
4,Soft is important,I'm in the contruction field and have to take pictures from time to time. I bought a Sony T9 digital because of it's size and it's 6 magapix. It cost alot of money and needed to be protected and the Sony LCS-CSG soft case was the right move. It covers the whole camera and has a soft lining to protect the large viewing screen. I wish it had a spare pocket for an extra battery or storage.
2,"""Soft Genuine Leather""? LOL!","This case is obviously NOT made of leather, let alone ""soft genuine leather."" It is clearly made of some kind of very stiff PVC vinyl. You can tell by lifting and examining the stitched covering that is folded over inside the flap. There is no evidence of any cowhide even though the tag inside says, ""Made in China"" and ""Material: 100% piel bovino."" I believe that translates to ""skin of cow"" but I repeat, this product is widely and FALSELY ADVERTISED as leather. The result is, you're paying as much as thirty dollars for a case that looks and feels like it's made from rare Chinese Vinyl Cows. Could this explain its recent price drop? Incidentally, this case does happen to fit the Sony DSC-T50 quite well, hence my promotion to 2 stars."
5,Great value,We wanted a case for our camera that was light weight and would protect the camera. Very easy business transaction and delivered fast.
2,Not what I wanted,"The case is much too large for the small camera. The idea of the SMALL camera is SMALL. The large case is bulky, hard and very inconvenient.I am very dissappointed and don't know what to do or how to return. Please help."
5,Camera Case,"I like this case because it is so small, it is exactly the size of the camera (I have the sony t200). You really have to make the choice of whether you want a bulky case that has a pocket for an extra battery pack or flash drive, or that has a clip....if that is what you are looking for this is not it. This is merely to protect your camera from damage with simple velcro access."
3,colorful but complicated!,"Book of Kaffe Fassett designs for men's, women's and kids' knitwear, creatively photographed in such places as Morocco and Key West. There's lots of full page spreads illustrating the jumpers which are pretty ambitious in terms of working with many colors simultaneously (intarsia cables for example!) but they certainly are attractive and I completed one (after a lot of tangles!)"
1,Pretty boring!,I didn't get beyond the first few pages. This book was pretty boring to me and very vanilla in content.
5,A Mexican-American's view.,El Norte gives an in depth look at the struggles immigrants must undergo to obtain a better life. The film is richly poignant and cuts to the heart of the matter. It gives us all a new understanding of what our ancestors had to over come in order for us to have the freedom that we now have grown so accustomed to. I applaude Gregory Nava for bringing this everyday reality to life.
5,A Classic Film I Use In My Classroom,"This is a classic American film which I have been using in my high school and college English and Spanish classes for twenty years. Although it is an 80's film, the content and the themes are as timely today as they were 20 years ago. Although the film is mostly in English, Spanish and Quiche (one of the major indian languages spoken in Guatemala) are also used adeptly in the film. This is probably the best film ever made about the immigrant experience in America. It puts the viewer in the place of the illegal immigrant and allows her/him to experience some of the same emotions as the characters, while they struggle to survive in very difficult circumstances. This is an important film, both from a historical and from a sociological perspective, and I highly recommend it for use in the classroom."
5,The book was very cool.,We think the book is very cool because she does a lot of funny things. One of the funny things is when she makes a jellyroll.One other funny thing is when she strings the beans.
4,A great book that neads proofreading...,"As a previous reviewer stated, if edited correctly, this book would have gotten the highest rating possible, and even more. The author successfully shows how GW is an oil-addicted, old-time republican, sort of a fox let loose in the chicken coop. Anyone who doubts that this administration is corrupt should this book. Anybody who does will see through the evil Bush Empire."
1,If you are not British - dont bother!,"Ok, I saw Peter Kay on Alan Carr who I find a scream and after looking at reviews of how fab Peter is I thort why not purchase this dvd. For one I had to rewind a few times as his accent is strong, I am from Australia (and yes we have a VERY stong accent and we are VERY close to the Brits - but I watched it twice and did not get his humour and did not laugh once and yes maybe it is his accent. If you are british - maybe go for it! but otherwise forget it! Not for me."
1,Fragile Cheap Plastic Seat,"I have owned 3 of these commodes and each of the seats cracked, in the exact same spot, after just a month or two. (See Pix) The unit is rated for 300 pounds and I weight 125. I purchased the Guardian G30211-4H which has a far stronger seat which, I estimate, will last a life-time."
3,A simple device to detect carbon monoxide,"I use this in my two-car garage which has good ventilation. I never had any problem with carbon monoxide in my basement or garage in the last 12 years, and this gadget has been working fine for the last two weeks. This is a simple plug in device with battery backup that provides power for continual monitoring of carbon monoxide. It also comes complete with an ""Alarm Action"" chart that instructs you on what to do if the alarm sounds.There are several detectors available in the market some of which can detect very low levels of carbon monoxide. If detection sensitivity is important to you, I suggest you do more research before you buy this. In the meantime, if any issue comes up with this devise, I will update this review with my observation.1.BRK SC7010B Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Combination Alarms with Photoelectric and Battery Back Up2.Kn-cosm-xrt-b Combination Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Detector"
5,Product as expected,The ink is a perfect match with my Dell Photo All-in-One printer 966. I will buy again
1,Terrible. Absolutely terrible.,"Terrible writing, terrible directing, terrible acting. I could go on, but this movie doesn't deserve that much effort. There are many gems to be found in the genre of independent horror. This, however, is not one of them - it's a strictly Z-grade production in every regard. Don't waste your time."
5,Not your typical Viking Romance,"If you think that this is one of the typical, silly romance novels featuring a hunky Viking and a California chick disguised in a tunic and a tartan, you are wrong!This is a very well written novel about survival in the Dark Ages. The atmosphere in the novel is perfect: It is as dark as it should be, brutal and depressing at times. Thorsten and Doireann are true medieval characters who reflect the cruelty and the superstitious character of the period without making us dislike them.Still, The Winter Serpent is an enjoyable read. Maggie Davis knew how to enter the elements of hope, compassion and love in this novel without taking the easy course for creating too likeable, too modern characters.In short I can guarentee you a satisfying read, you will not be disappointed if you buy this book."
4,Great Tripod,I love the ease of use of this tripod and the build quality is top notch. Tehre is virtually no slack in the unit. The one complaint that I have is that the vibration transfer in the tripod is still not what I needed it to be when shooting in a good wind but I guess that is to be expected at this price point. Final thoughts: great tripod thats easy to setup and manipulate with some weight to it.
2,Worked Well for a While,"This tripod worked well for about a year and then the small levers inserted at the top of the legs (the ones you press to allow the legs to spread wider than the standard width) corroded and became unusable. The tripod can still be used in a limited way. I will end up replacing the unit pretty soon. It appears to me that the metal used in this area is of substantially poorer qualtiy than the rest of the unit. This isn't a $900 carbon fiber tripod and I didn't expect it to last as long (forever). It isn't a cheapee either, though, and it should have lasted longer."
5,Vic perfection,"I have always like Victorinox tools, especially their SAKs. I recently ordered two of them after not having any for a long time: the Climber, and the Huntsman. Both of these are superb: excellent fit and finish, the right tools, lightweight. The Climber is is my pants pocket always, and the Huntsman with its saw is in my hiking pack. I almost forgot how good these are!!"
5,Nice Kit,"This great kit for kids age 10 to 14, that like to draw. It gives they a storeage place too"
4,Portable Sketch Folio Drawing Kit,I bought this folio for my husband who likes drawing. What's really nice about this product is the size. It is compact and easy to take with him whereever he goes.
2,"Not impressed, at least for a quick reference for a cover band.",The song selections were not great. There are some real obvious songs that are not in here. Most of the ones included wouldn't be worth the time for a cover band to learn which is why I bought the book. The chords structures are also a bit problematic. The book seems to be tailored more towards keyboard players. I wouldn't use it as a reference for guitar.
2,PRINT TOO SMALL,"July 8 2006I am fifty eight and have just started to play piano via thechord method and I have perhaps a dozen fake books.The print in this fake book is entirely too small and difficultto read, making it a chore to use it. I should haveknown better - it has 500 plus pages and oftentimes two songsper page.For those of you who have difficulty reading small print - Iwear reading glasses - stick with the Hal Leonard fake books which have approximately 200 pages and 100 songs. My favorites are: Easy Fake Book, Broadway Fake Book, First Fake Book, Simplified Fake Book, Easy 60s Fake Book, Classical Fake Book (new edition). They are easy to read and enjoyable. An improvement I would suggest would be a spiral binding.The bigger the book, the more songs, the smaller the print.I understand that this book is for all audiences, but I suggest that about 70% of the songs were minor hits.Katherine BrownWayne, NJ"
3,Not your first choice. . .,Although this book did have some good information - I did not find anything completly invaluable. As a mother with Asperger's who is homeschooling my son who also has Asperger's I found her conclusions to her son's behavior misguided. I would not advice purchasing this book as your first guide to homeschooling your child with Asperger's.
3,Nostalgia trip to past futures,"After the irritatingly anti-feminist, anti-environmentalist Rushing to Paradise, it was certainly pleasing to read Cocaine Nights. Although certainly not a masterpiece, nor even a particularly compelling mystery novel, Cocaine Nights is Ballard`s most readable novel in a few years. Compared to Ballard`s most exciting work, that written in the 1960s and 1970s, it will inevitably disappoint, but Cocaine Nights, in returning to many of Ballard`s earlier themes from books such as High Rise or Vermilion Sands does at least have the virtue of bringing the reader into a familiar world--sort of a nostalgia trip into past futures. If you like Ballard, or if you`re unfamiliar with his work, this is certainly a novel worth reading. Just don`t expect too much."
5,I want more...,"Great lens cap. Easy to use even in cold / bulky/ awkward situations. Holds a good grip (unlike other ""generics""). I highly recommend. Sounds silly to say that about a lens cap, but it's true."
1,NOT HAPPY,"This is a very nice looking clock and functions very well as stated in the product discription, except for me I CAN'T SEE IT AT NIGHT OR ANY OTHER TIME. The light is almost non existant, so forget trying to see it at night, which is why I bought it in the first place. The design is such that a bedside lamp doesn't shine light on it. The only way I can actually see what time it is, is to physically pick up the clock and look at it straight on I wish someone would manufacture a bedside clock that would have the day, date, month, indoor temp, and stay lit all night without pushing a button. THIS, IS NOT THAT CLOCK."
3,"Smells great, but doesn't last long","We have a high-efficiency furnace that we spray this on the filters for. For a day or two, they make the house smell great! However, after, at most, 2-3 days, if you want the house to keep smelling great, you have to go back down and spray more on it. And we're talking @8 pumps of the spray each time. YMMV."
5,"Dark, Twisted, and Simply Amazing","Not since I was a 10 year old child watching Dragon Ball Z on Toonami had I been so glued to my television. Initially, I reluctantly watched the first episode, five minutes into it, I was hooked. Simply one of the most amazing pieces of work I have ever seen - however, this is not for the close-minded or weak-stomached."
4,Yep,"I liked the anime so therefore I liked the dvd set. Thankfully they weren't some grainy quality. Overall, it's a good buy."
5,"Violent, but extremely entertaining","I have seen a lot of anime and this one was ""wow"". Twists, sub-stories, extreme violence, cute, funny, scary, sad, happy -- an emotional roller-coaster ride that kept me wanting more. Extremely good character and story design. Definitely for adults because of the violence and adult situations. This is a must have for any serious anime fan. SPOILER: First couple minutes of series consists of a horned girl killing many people in her escape from a secret research center."
1,Insubstantial and disgusting anime,"Elfen Lied pretends to be profound but it is an implausible story with annoying characters (properly speaking: catgirls and imbeciles), superficial symbolism and an unsatisfactory ending. Take a good look at the allegedly heavy with meaning elements and you will conclude that the creators have not used their heads at all - you will feel as if taken for a fool."
4,Awesome camera for the price,"I love this camera. The trick to the battery usage is rechargable batteries. They work and I can use the batteries for the whole day. It also takes great pictures. I carried this camera around Europe with me for a month and have fantastic pictures and had no problems at all. Also, Samsung is great with their customer service. I spilled a beer on my camera after the warranty expired and they still replaced the camera (not all the buttons were working) for no charge. Great purchase!"
5,A Very Excellent Film by Possibly America's Greatest Film-Maker,"Michael Moore has confirmed much of my views of the American society from America's position as the ""leader of the free world"" to the way 'black' characters are easily eliminated in some mainstream movies to the way people are easily influenced by what they see on TV. This is a great film. It is very well made, and timeless. All the actors and actresses were amazing. Michael's cameo was brief, but unforgettable. The songs are relevant and wonderful. I hope he makes more movies. R.I.P John Candy."
1,Does not play on US DVD players,Very disapointed. Did not get to enjoy the movie due to it being limited to only play out of the country.
3,LOST INSIDE OF BARBRA,"I have been a lifelong fan of Barbra's since her first appearance on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW but if she's ever made a misstep in her illustrious career, it's her remake of A STAR IS BORN. Her voice is remarkable as always, but pairing her with the vocally challenged Kris Kristofferson doomed the project from the start. His contributions to this soundtrack are merely annoying to me.Babs' numbers are expectedly very good, especially Leon Russell's sultry LOST INSIDE OF YOU and the plaintive WITH ONE MORE LOOK AT YOU.It's not a bad album, but not one of her best."
5,Excellent,"Loved the moview when it first came out. LOVE both artist and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the CD!Excellent!"
5,A Star is Born,"This will be my 3rd purchase of this CD - I have worn the others out one after the other! My first time purchased was before there were CDs, it was a cassette! But I love the music and the excellent voices of Barbara and Chris!"
3,Excellent scholarship but is it Christian?,"The NOAB demonstrates excellent scholarship in all its features such as book introductions, annotations, articles etc. The quality of the leather editions is excellent with sewn binding and large font. I recommend this Bible for christians and non-christians who want to look at some of the literary aspects of the biblical text although the annotations contain some speculation in this area. My main concern with this Bible is that the notes make little or no attempt to discuss historic christian teachings and interpretations. These should at least be represented along with more liberal views. There is nothing in this Bible's features (except the text) that will help those searching for a closer relationship with God or for those who are hurting; lonely or struggling with some life issue. This Bible is great for the University setting but offers little where ""the rubber meets the road"". I guess that wasn't it's intent....unfortunately."
4,"""Excellent, But not Perfect""","The NOAB third edition has been a good scholarly resource to research and personal study. The annotation on the Bible verses and the introductory information of each Bible book are well written with good scholarship. Maps are clearly printed and location are well indicated. Concordance is catered to the needs of the reader, and only if more details are required, a comprehensive concordance may be used. The fonts are excellent for reading. Generally, the NOAB third edition is an indispensable resource for scholars, professors, and pastors. The only discrepancy of this Bible is that it is a hugh material to carry around. It would be perfected by having the size trim to the size of NIV Study Bible Personal Size. Otherwise, it is a perfect resource for serious biblical study."
5,You should buy this album,Hello I strongly suggest you buy this item. Also I lived right buy there house. Any way you should buy this item.
3,"Great for 2 weeks, until it was dropped on a carpeted floor","My kids used this more or less daily for 2 weeks straight, as a car toy. The regular size Etch a Sketch was a bit too big to cram into my purse when we went to restaurants, so I purchased this one. It seemed like a good value until my kid dropped it (about 3 feet drop) unto a carpeted floor. One of the knobs popped off and because the plastic broke, I could not get it back on. Being able to control only one direction of etching gets old after about 20 seconds. We tried to superglue the part back on, but it still did not work. Off to the landfill. Too bad - if the manufacturer had just invested a few more pennies to make this more durable, it could have been a terrific travel toy. Would not recommend - stick with the larger size if you can."
3,Good Storyline pitty it has Kevin Costner,"A lot of people have wondered why Kevin Costners films have all been big flops since the bodyguard. Its because he can't play different characters, Billy Chapel(Kevin Costner) is exactly the same character as Kevin Plays in all his movies, Body Guard, Robin Hood and Message in a bottle. To stay at the top in hollywood you need variation, different characters. The storline of the movie is good, the story of a veteran baseball player who is on his last season thinking about his life as he plays a vital game, buy taking his mind off the game he starts to step up his game and is very close to the pitchers ""perfect game"" - which is no body makes it to home plate for the whole game a shut out. There is not much chemistry between Kevin and Kelly at all and Kevins portrayal of his typical character, being upset is laughable! On the upside, the DVD has lots of special features so if you like baseball then buy it, if your after a love story then stay away."
5,Focus and Committment,"For the ""Love of the Game"" is a great entertaining movie. The story is full of what one would expect in conflict, intrigue and perseverance. However, what I enjoyed most was the fact that it is a study of focus, intent and commitment. It is an education on how to block out the negative and travel a path of positive thought followed by action and belief in oneself. A must view for all high school and college students.Capt. Ron Eslinger, United States Navy retired"
5,"I love, ""For Love Of the Game!""","If you love Baseball, you can't miss this movie. Like ""Field of Dreams,"" it is a must see/own. I would highly recommend you add this movie to your collection. We have to have our wonderful Baseball movies to get us through till next Summer!"
3,For the Love of the Game,"For the love of the game. I have one question, why? For the Love of the Game is just an average baseball movie. If you really want to see Kevin Costner in a baseball movie, go get ""Field of Dreams or Bull Durham.""For the love of the game, is a fine movie for killing two hours if you have nothing else to do, or if you are a fan of Kevin Costner or Kelly Preston. if you like a director Sam Rami,(aka Jockser the Mighty). The dvd is packed with triva that would the frustrate the non-baseball fan."
3,AMERICAN CRAP,"Obviously made to redeem KEVIN COSTNER's career at the box office after a few failures,FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME is not half as good as was his previous baseball movies:BULL DURNHAM AND FIELD OF DREAMS.If you want to watch a good movie about baseball, you should view PRIDE OF THE YANKEES OR EIGHT MEN OUT.I hate the way the narrative switch here;this does not convince me at all.Everything turns around BILLY CHAPPEL's perfect game and his relation with a girl he met while playing on the road.There is something phoney about this film that turned me off.The fact that this was not a true baseball story did not help.I have a message for movie producers.How about a film on MARK FRIEDRICH who used to play for the TIGERS.This guy for those who remember,used to talk to his ball."
1,Does not play on PS3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought it would play om my PS3, it only plays on HD DVD, Sony's competition to Blu-ray. Already opened and tried to play it, so now I am stuck with it. Amazon should explain this before you buy it!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Baseball lovers movie,I like sport / baseball movies and this is a good one. I like the interaction between the pitcher and the batter.I gave it 3 stars because there is not enough of it!
1,Could've been made in the 40s starring Ronald Reagan,"Boring, maudlin, mawkish, charmless, depressing, contrived, unrealistic, shallow, awkward, embarrassing, plodding, confusing, slow...am I leaving anything out? My favorite scene: Costner's on the mound, a former teammate somes up to bat. Costner wonders aloud ""Are we really that old?"" This is the work of a talented director in over his head and eager to please, and an over-the-hill overpaid actor who needs to get back to his roots."
3,"A poor introduction, a mediocre supplement, three stars.","Typical deignful art critic mumbo jumbo. Above all else, the colors are black and white, robbing them of one of the most important elements. Sometimes I think they tried really hard, but in the end I believe it is an inferior product given the options you have as a consumer. Buy Tracey's book and then buy this one and let me know what you think.Bravo."
4,Does the Job...,"A nice looking cottonball/cotton swab holder. The knob on top is small making it a little hard to get a good grasp in order to lift the lid off, but it's a minor issue."
2,Look what the cat dragged in!,"Lonesome and frustrated wallflower Maryam D'Abo (hipergorgeous as usual) is some sorta female Dr Frankenstein who makes a tomcat out of a gym rat (Grieco) in order to have a lover.CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? Then this your kinda picture. Me, I prefer my sci-fi with a little common sense!Nevertheless, don't miss the first scenes!"
3,Don't know if I'd buy again.,"Item was inexpensive, arrived very quickly, and just as described, but picture was quite snowy using it. We eventually went with a converter instead."
2,Poor S-Video To Composite,"I got this particular adapter since it claims good S-Video to Composite conversion. This is still a very cheap and simple conversion that leads to a very annoying checkerboard pattern on everything. I am aware that the quality will be lower than S-Video, but the picture quality is pretty much unbearably bad. You get what you pay for."
4,Good item,I have a svideo-rca cable but my Dell 700M doesn't reconize the TV input. So I tried this one and it works great! I will give it 5 stars if they can charge a more reasonable shipping. $11 bucks for a simple adaptor is too expensive in my opinion.
5,How home network setup should have been all along.,"I struggled off and on for two months to get a DSL modem and a router to work together (tried two different name-brand routers). I spent late nights on Tech Support calls, pushing re-set buttons, re-running install CD's, fiddling with IP addresses, etc. Finally, I gave up in disgust.I got the 2Wire unit, plugged it in and connected the cables, and I was up & running in 8 minutes. Fast access on the desktop and great wireless speed all around the house. The DSL modem is now where it belongs - in the trash.If you want to go wireless without getting an ulcer, this is your unit."
2,Wireless Modem,"With Verizon this unit could not be used. I waisted my money. My tech guy said it was an older generation unit, don't be fooled unless you know. Caution!!"
3,Eddie's worst show,"Let me start by saying that I love Eddie Izzard. I flew to Chicago from the South just to see this show. it was not that good. I mean yes there are some funny parts because its Eddie, but over all not good. But I told myself that maybe it was because it was early in the tour. then I got my hands on the video and even tho it was a COMPLETELY different show. still his worst one by far. on a brighter note I just saw his new tour ""Stripped"" last night and it was GREAT."
5,For biology lovers,"Rare, from Professor Menees, California State College, Long Beach. Tinted photos and very detailed drawings.Hole punches for easy placement in binder. Great deal, recommended."
4,Amazing Keyboards by Mark Mercier,"This Cd is excellent, although I have heard them Play much better, live in concert. The Sping Water Cd i feel has a little more quality beats, but Windows is still a rockin' album. My only somewhat negitive comment is that I will always see your face has a stange chours , with Marks keyboard, I really love the way you play the song now. Great Record!!!"
2,Practice golf balls,"Many broke when I hit them, cracked right in two! I thought I had been out of the golf loop for years and needed practice, but when I hit these balls and destroyed them, I thought, Look out Links, here I come!! Well, my fantasy is over. It's just that the practice balls are inferior, like my golf game. I'll keep practicing but maybe not with these balls."
3,The C.D. was defective,"The package appeared ok but in fact the diskSaturn In Opposition ( Saturno contro ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Italy] was defective. i was promised a replacement by Priority Mail, and I'm still waiting"
5,"Great fit, perfect design",A must have for your Jeep. Looks great fits amazing many uses but very well designed and a plus for any attachments.
5,"not quick, but really helpful","As a new Tablet PC user, I heartily recommend this book. Using a new technology effectively isn't usually ""quick"" for most of us, and we waste valuable time learning by trial and error. For the time and frustration it's saved me, this book has been well worth its cost. The explanations and illustrations are clear, material is introduced in the proper order, and it's easy to find what what you're looking for when you go back to refresh your memory about a procedure."
3,3 Cups does not equal 3 measuring cups,"It really equals 3 tea cups. I found the name of the product on Amazon completely misleading. No where on the packaging does it say ""3-cup."" As a prior review says, it is much smaller. This is enough coffee for one person (barely). I recommend the larger size."
2,Broken french press = no caffeine = BAD!,"I purchased this particular french press two months ago. I was delighted, as it stated that it was 'top rack dishwasher safe'. However, despite diligently following those precious directions, the press came apart without any hope of salvation as I went to press my coffee. The beaker was fine, but the broken press left me with a nice cup of sludge. Something that feeds such a vital addiction as the morning cup of coffee should not fall apart when one needs it the most!"
1,Missing,The item arrived broken and my daughter says she never received the replacement that the company sent.
4,BonJour 3-Cup Review,"This coffee press works great. I keep the 8-cup at work and use the smaller 3-cup at home or to take on trips. I would definitely recommend this product mainly because of its durability, but I would go with the 8-cup and not the 3-cup (it is too small)."
3,Cotton ball & swab holders,"This item would have been a whole lot better if it had thicker plastic or glass. Either way, it is still very conveinent to have. It sure beats a cup & looks pretty good on our bathroom countertop."
2,"Original artist, but not the original recordings!! Check out ""At Their Best"" instead.","Unfortunately, and inexplicably, this seems to be the only readily available CD of Chalice's music, and so it is valuable for that reason. On the other hand, for those familiar with the originals, these are woefully inferior re-recordings of the hits they had in Jamaica in the 1980's. Chalice had several albums and several hits and I don't undersand why the originals are not available on CD. Compared to the originals, these recordings sound rushed and soulless. I was happy when I saw the tracks included, but was sorely disappointed as I listened to them. Please, please, if anyone who can do anything about it is reading this, please find a way to give us the originals of these songs and albums!! ......and Robbie Peart is missing from ""I'm Trying""!Update: The original Chalice cuts are now available on the ""At Their Best"" compilation, which Amazon now has for mp3 download. Click this link:At Their Best"
5,Great Product for a Great Price,"I was reluctant to purchase due to some of the reviews but I thought for the price, it would be worth the risk. It works exactly as described. Does everything it is supposed to and the price cannot be beat."
2,Not needed,I was trying to go with a calendar based device that would work with my new Windows 7 but the Tungsten E2 and all the hardware I purchased to support it was useless.
1,Does not work as advertised,It is really not worth the time to order because even if it is 3.00 inc shipping you are still without a cable to sync your data.....and maybe ruin your pda because part of the cable gets stuck and will not come off.
2,A compilation of the rejected ones,I was so dissapointed with this Fania DJ Series: Gilles Peterson . I like Gilles choices on previous comp. and also mhis BBC radio show is outstanding. But this album really sucks. I`m a big fan of FANIA records and I had never heard most of this tracks before. I think that they were rejected in the past by fans and it was cheap to license them for use in this Compilation. Buy it used if you can
2,spotty instructional quality,"From a designers perspective, what a great book-looks fabulous. From an instructors point of view, well it can be frustrating to use. The editor didn't catch many ambigous sentences and the editor needs to hire an instructor with strong teaching skills to review and revamp the instructions in this book. For example, if a task requires 5 steps, the book will often only mention 1,2,5. An example of a ambigous sentence: ""Duplicate the layer you are working before starting the extraction process as the extraction process removes rather than hides the pixels surplus to requirements"". What in the world does ""..surplus to requirements"" mean?"
4,the date of the book arrival,the date of arrival should be make it more clearly coz last time I thought the book will arrive on 21st Aug but it actually comes on 8th Aug it make me feel nervous coz last time I need to use the book quite urgent.
2,not impressed,"this item is ok if you've never used these kinds of things before and for the price not too bad to start with i guess... i was just very disappointed everything in it was cheaply made and even worse my kit was missing items, oh and the dua tone balls are huge!"
3,Decent at best,"It was missing items, but we got what we really wanted, which was the vibrator. It works great and we haven't had any issues with it. THe coupons and dice are a lot of fun for changing things up, but overall, everything besides the vibrator does feel pretty cheap. still glad we bought it though. A good starters kit."
2,"An ok short story, but a waste for a novel","I'm a Joe Haldeman fan (his Hugo and Nebula winners are excellent) but this book reads more like a verbose short story then a full novel. A third of the way through I gave up and began scanning and eventually skipped to the end and ho-hummed the book closed. Perhaps I missed something, but I doubt it. Save your money and time and buy another novel instead."
1,This is SF? Extremely disappointed,"Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this book, since I threw it out after reading less than a third. Mr. Haldeman had always been able to tell a great story without resorting to explicit descriptions of sexual acts and repeated crude profanity. I guess he had to use these tactics to disguise the fact that he didn't have any concepts to stimulate scientific speculation. I kept hanging on, hoping it would improve, but it only got worse. If I wanted this kind of drivel, I would just buy the latest best-selling technothriller at Costco. I repeat - I'm very disappointed."
1,Waste of Time,"This highly derivative work which reeks of Sagan-rip-off shows that Joe Haldeman can only write sci-fi war stories. He tries to here, but the fails miserably. Only the ending is seemingly interesting, but it too is derivative."
2,"nice original format, but very short on science","I gave the book a couple of stars because the presentation is very original -- we get to hop around between various persons and their points of view as the alien visitation is approaching. It creates a dynamic flow that keeps you with the story. However, the story itself is lacking. It's bigger on sex and blackmail than it is on science. I was hoping for something that discussed more of the characters feelings towards the alien arrival, but what you get is just a bunch of uninteresting personal side-stories about who's had affairs with who. The book also loses a star for having the characters speak a dialog that is a mixture of spanish and english. The author probably has a point here -- English will continue to absorb spanish words, but the effect is distracting and just didn't work for me. Lastly, the ending seemed rushed and poorly thought out."
1,This isn't my American Heritage,"A great new age, globalization attempt to wipe out words such as: United States of America, United States Army, United States Navy, United States Marines, and United States Air Force. Also all the mythological figures are pictured from Apollo to Zeus, so us ignorant ""picture only"" Americans can view them. I like my 1970 Webster's, even though its old, it still has the United States of America as a word."
3,The American Heritage Dictionary,El el libro esta en buenas condiciones no esta nuevo pero resuelve.... muy bueno me gusto mucho.... el precio ni se diga.... el tiempo en que se tardo tambien ... fue muy bueno... tienen B en calificacion...
2,not good for a high arch,"If you have a high arch, good luck getting these babies on...bought my usual size and can't get my foot past the turn of the shaft.Too bad, because they're a great looking boot."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"This is a disappointing follow-up to her wonderful debut album ""Words"". Austin's songwriting doesn't quite match her potentially powerful voice. Lively but bland set of country tunes."
2,Really Tiny,This product appeared to be much bigger than it was. I was disappointed with this order.
4,Pacino is good,"Al Pacino makes one hell of a comeback as a N.Y. cop tracking a killer. He's definitely my favorite actor, save Deniro. This movie gets docked a star only because of Ellen Barkin... not exactly my favorite actress."
5,Always Entertaining,"Al Pacino, Ellen Barkin and John Goodman are all so entertaining to watch that I've always enjoyed this film no matter how many times I've seen it.The suspense is what this film is all about, but I am fascinated with these actors, including supporting performances by Michael Rooker and William Hickey. Although her looks are a little hard and her mouth way too profane, Barkin never looked better and sexier. That Pacino's character, ""Detective Frank Keller"" would fall for her is understandable.However, adultery, once again is excused in this film along with other not-so-moral acts so this isn't a film you want to show to your church group. All three of the leads are very weak, ethically-speaking.The fact that this film can go on for almost two hours with very little action and still keep you riveted to your seat speaks highly of its entertainment value. Why national critics knocked it so much, I don't know. Hey, it's good entertainment. What more do you want?"
3,Not really noticing a big difference...,"I have been using this product for quite a while now, several months. I put it on every day before I apply my make-up, and on occasion I will put it on before I go to sleep. I have some freckles under my eyes, and on my upper lip from the sun, and it seem like this product may have lightened it some, but not anything really THAT noticeable. I keep hoping that if I keep sticking to the routine my freckles will eventually fade, but it's really discouraging. At least the product is cheap, but I probably wont buy it again after I run out."
4,Fresh from the garden to your plate,"This book is great for beginner raw foodist. I love introdution into the books on how straight foward it is and how it gives you a basic list of what you'll need from appliances, knives, bowls to groceries and raw knowledge. Also, what I love most about the book are the wonderful side notes on each recipe on what you'll need to create you dish."
4,Great Simple Start to Raw Food,This is a terrific little book if you like to make simple dishes quickly and dive right into the raw food way of eating. The recipes are for one or two people so they are very convenient for making something just for yourself or multiplying the quantities for a family.The recipes may be too simple for those who have already been eating raw for some time but are perfect for the newbie.
1,Overpriced book,This is filled with uninteresting recipes. Can't find one that I want to make. Save your money and watch her videos instead. Instead of provided the materials needed she should provide the nutritional information.
2,not really very good at all,"I didn't find this book helpful at all. I've been raw for about a month now, and need help w some of the difficult things like eating raw on the go, and how to soak and dehydrate. She addresses neither of these things. This is basically a book that describes most of the tools you need (but not all), and then has some recipes. Very disappointing."
5,Very helpful book.,"I am new to raw foods and this book makes it easy to learn about raw foods, i.e., veggies, nuts, fruits without cooking the enzymes out of them. Recipes are easy to follow. Book is informative for those who are just learning about raw foods. And the recipes are good!"
5,Best Raw Food Starter Book,"As a raw food chef, Jenny's book is always the one I recommend to my friends who want to try raw foods for themselves. There are lots of pictures and the recipes are simple and well written. The recipes are all delicious and her brownies are worth the price of admission alone!"
2,Ah man!,"Ok...I was really disappointed. This is not what I had anticipated, but it is just what it says in other reviews a newbie guide to raw. But I expected so much more info on foods and combinations as well as simple but interesting ideas. Not stuff like Grape juice: bunch of grapes, then juice! I mean really now. If any one can tell me where to find a great raw food book that has 1-4 ingredient recipes that are fun, realistic and interesting, please let me know."
3,Half of recipes unnecessary,"I should have listened to the other reviewers! I don't think the recipes on making juice needed to be in here. I did like some of her salad dressing/dip recipes, though. Would be great if there were more pictures to make the recipes more appealing."
2,Disappointing,"Although I do not cook much, I have read and browsed countless cookbooks since a young age. If I had the chance to thumb through this book at a bookstore before buying it, I definately would have put it back on the shelf. Actually, I probably wouldn't have even picked it up as it just looks like a cheaply produced book by an amateur. Its dull, few pictures and many recipes require that you refer to other recipes in the book in order to make your selected recipe. I really hate starting a recipe and then finding out that I need to flip to some other section in the book and prepare another recipe in order to complete the recipe I started."
4,"Pretty good, but not great","I've had this book for about a month, and I've made many of the recipes. They were all very good. But, as someone who does not only eat raw food, I find myself drawn to the recipes for things like guacamole and olive tapenade, which I could find in a lot of other books.I was also really disappointed that so much of the book is devoted to useless recipes for smoothies and salads. Who actually needs to follow a recipe for a garden salad? And the recipe for the cantaloupe smoothie can be boiled down to ""cut up some cantaloupe and stick in it a blender"". Duh.Still, I'm going to give the book 4 stars. There are a fair amount of creative recipes in here, and they are all pretty easy. I really like the fact that all the necessary equipment and ingredients can be found at my local grocery store."
4,Very Entertaining / Great Kung-fu action,I loved this movie from beginning to end. Great fighting scenes and a better than ok story line. I really enjoyed this movie a lot. You wont be disappointed.
2,I bought this because of other reviews,"I bought this book because the other reviews were wonderful, and I was so disappointed. I don't understand how people thought this book was romantic. They meet and marry within 1 day, after having no more than 15 words with each other. Then in the first 50 pages, they lie to each other, one is accused of murder, and then they run away together to avoid the situation. The hero seems more like a boy than a man, while the heroine is par to say the least. Also, the dialogue between the characters is boring. The only good dialogue is when the heroine stands up for herself to another woman. I've read many many romance novels, and this one did not deserve a 5 star rating in my book."
3,Definetly awesome for beginner 3d collectors,"This product is a good starter for a beginning 3d collector. The movies are older so I don't really see the 3d effect. However, the system will play any shutter movie. These graphics are amazing for home theater systems. The only downfall is that it eats batteries.. I recommend to buy rechargeable batteries or buy a system that you can plug into the wall."
3,Size doens't fit,"I bought this 15.4' for my Toshiba, and it doesn't fit. It would be wonderful if the seller add the deptb of the sleeve in the description. I returned it as it can't fit my laptop at all."
1,an unfortunate waste of plastic,"this release somehow became hip amongst about 10 people...a clear sign that some affected coolsters will embrace anything to be thought of as being on the cutting edge. don't fall prey to believing this is wild, free, experimental rock music b/c its not."
5,An opportunity to learn how to choose happiness,"This book shows you how you build your own prison walls that prevent you from experiencing happiness and love. It then explains how you can create a more joyful reality by changing your mind and attitude and making different choices in your life. Everyone with whom I have shared the book has benefitted from it, and I recommend it highly to anyone and everyone."
1,big disappointment,"i pruchased the 3 computer product. I installed and have been in email tag with norton support ever since. My computer will not shutdown after installation. They have no idea why. I have been through the same protocols over and over again for over three weeks. I was finally told that installing version 7.02 would fix it for sure. I did and it did not.I was also told that unlike other products such as webroot, when you buy a three ciomputer pack, then expiration date is tied to installation on the first computer. If the three computers do not have the same installation date-like mine -i had 2006 installed on three computers which were put on at different times-you can lose the value of the subscription. When I called Norton customer service -i get the reply that what can you expect we gave you a bargain-about 70 on a three computer deal. The service was rude and not helpful. I asked why it did not say anthing on the box or in the manual and was told that was my proble,."
5,good book straight to the point and fast service!!,this a great spellbook and it lets you look at the tarot in a whole differnt way if you never use magic with the tarot before!! also the spell are easy so you should not have any trouble! the service was fast and on time i will use this company again if and when needed!!thanks
5,This book is sublime,"I am thrilled with the content of this book, because it contains the most meaningful lyrics of lou reed along with much of his college work that would be otherwise difficult to find. The book is inspirational for anyone who likes writing, and entertaining for everyone else."
2,Interesting recipes......,I found this book to have interesting recipes but I was disappointed with the lack of pictures in the book.
3,Nice shape shame about the stand.,"The Executor Super Star destroyer certainly looks nice and evil, sadly the attachment point for the stand is too far to the rear of the model, so it never sits properly on the stand. The attached Star destroyer (which shows the scale of the model) is plastic and poorly detailed. Fortunately, thirty seconds work with a screw driver had it removed. Would have worked much better if the model would sit on its stand properly."
2,Not so healthy!,"Yes this is a book of raw vegan, multi-ethnic recipes but that does not necessarily mean the recipes are healthy! Quite to the contrary, even though the editorial reviewers tout how ""healthy"" this collection of recipes is, I was personally shocked to see how very high fat practically every recipe is! True, many of these recipes are interesting and different, some are standard and usual, but all seemed to be based on an inordinate amount of nuts, seeds and oil and also represent very poor food combining. This is not healthy daily fare but very rich raw foods which should be enjoyed in moderation and on special occasions only, if at all.To its credit I have to say that it is a nice, organized, well written book with a few pretty and appealing pictures but overall I do not find it to be a very useful book or one I would want to keep in my collection."
5,"Fantastic for Western gardeners, but leaves out rest of USA","When I lived in California, this book was fantastic! So thorough and easy to read. I used it all the time. But since I live in Indiana now, I wish it had info about Midwestern climate zones, soil types, and recommended plants."
4,This is a great filter wallet,"Not much to say here, but this is a great filter wallet, compact, lightweight and well-built."
3,A Haunted House,"Jill and her family inherit Uncle Solly's house. He was a famous magician. There is one catch; the house is on Fear Street!At first, Jill loves the house, but then she starts seeing weird, nasty creatures. Are they poltergeists?The Ghost of Fear Street series was not written by R.L. Stine, but by ghostwriters. I do not know if he gave them the actual ideas for the books, or did the ghostwriter created it. House of a Thousand Screams is your typical haunted house tale, but with a clever twist at the end."
1,Not just horrible but dangerous!!,"So it worked for the first 2 weeks, then it stopped working so I ordered another card reader. The second card reader didnt work at all! I've tried using the second card reader on three different computers and used multiple card types and nothing worked! Then today I tried using the first card reader again and the chord got super super hot then a piece of plastic shot off and it smoked and there was a little flame!!!! A FLAME!! So yeah not just horrible but DANGEROUS! Avoid at ALL costs! Its worth the extra money NOT to buy this product!!"
2,does not work,"This product does not work. There is no driver disc with it and it is not a plug, or it is defective. There is no disc to insert and it does not work from there even after inserting a memory card. You get what you pay for and I have gotten several products here that did not work now. Disappointed."
3,a good magazine piece turned into a so so book,"A mildly interesting narrative of a few Jews taking a field trip to India. But I didn't learn as much about Buddhism as I thought I would; perhaps Kamenetz should have discussed the basic ideas of Buddhism in more detail. For example, sometimes he suggests that Buddhism doesn't really take a position on deities, their existence etc. (which is what I had always thought, and which explains how you can be both Jewish and Buddhist) and at other times he refers in passing to Buddhist ""deities"" (implying that Buddhism is somehow polytheistic). So which is true? Kamenetz doesn't explain."
5,typing is a breeze,"I had this keyboard for years for my desktop computer. I have carpel tunnel and this works much better. All I needed was the UBS connector, but I found buying this product was cheaper than just the connector."
3,Not spill resitant,"If you spill any amount of liquid on this keyboard whatosoever, individual keys will stop responding within minutes and you'll need a replacement. I'm on my 3rd or 4th replacement within a few years now due to minor coffee splashes and it's starting to become a burden on my wallet. Given the age of the product and the typical price of competing keyboards, it's really about time for a new spill-resistant design or a substantial price drop.Unfortunately, I've grown to love this bizarrely spaced key layout and find it to be very comfortable, so I guess I'm stuck replacing it once a year or so. Either that, or give up my coffee habit."
3,satisfied except for the arrow key arrangement,"This is a good ergo keyboard for the price. The only aspect that is really, really annoying is the arrangement of the 4 arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN)-- the separate arrow keys that are not embedded in the number pad. The arrow keys are unusually small, and the arrangement is weired. It's very hard to get used to them. I think MS made it that way because there's not much space. The arrow key arrangement sometimes makes me regret the purchase although I like its ergo feature very much. I'd pay for extra $ to improve this key arrangement or have the usual arrow key arrangement at the expense of the separate number pad. Maybe it's just me. Try those keys first before buying this. If you don't get bothered by that, it's a good keyboard to buy."
4,Pleased with keyboard (Compatible with Macintosh),"First time I have owned an ergonomic keyboard and I am pleased with the results. My right wrist feels significantly better. It actually feels a little weird now to type on a straight keyboard. Also, I believe my words per minute has increased with less errors so I don't have to hit the backspace button as much, which, along with the angled keyboard, helps in not straining my wrists as much. Although not load, the keyboard isn't exactly quiet either. Especially the space bar, which others have complained about. For me it is quiet enough. And the awkward arrow keys are annoying, but manageable. Overall I am pleased with the keyboard and it was a plug and play with my MacBook Pro running OSX leapord. No compatibility issues except for the special keys which I don't use anyway."
2,Fine ergonomics but stiff unresponsive keys,"I appreciate the effort that went into designing this keyboard. The layout is optimized for lengthy sessions without causing typical fatigue associated with standard keyboard layouts. Unfortunately, my unit has poor tactile response. They feel sticky and require considerable effort to press which makes typing a chose. I've had others that felt fine, but this one, for whatever reason has not delivered the expected level of quality. I gave it away to someone else who types much less than I and he hasn't complained."
2,6 months then would not work,"This keyboard was great for 6 months, then the letter B stopped working. The keyboard was not abused, nothing was spilled on it, and it was not banged on or mistreated. It worked well the night before then after sitting by itself undisturbed on the desk overnight(I don't have children and my wife has her own computer) I used it the next morning and the letter B was nonfunctional. Tried everything and it would not work. If you think the price is fair for a good 6 months of use then this keyboard is for you."
5,I love this keyboard!,"I am a medical transcriptionist, and this is the only keyboard I can use. I only wish it came in black. I have tried the 4000 model, but the keys are not ""clickey"". I can't get used to the soft touch of the 4000 or similar models. I came here to order a ""back up"" keyboard just in case my current keyboard goes out. I love this keyboard. If I try to use a standard keyboard it feels like my hands are on top of each other. I am in the market for a lap top and will have to get one that I can use with my Microsoft Natural Elite. It sure would look better if the Microsoft Natural Elite were black though."
4,microsoft natural keyboard elite,I have owned several of these. Pretty reliable but can double key if any liquid or dirt enters the upper keyboard key region. I tend to mess up keyboards this way. Would love to see some sort of shield made similar to my old IBM keyboard which had an internal formed plastic sheet which was up inside each key and kept anything from reaching the board inside. I keep buying them as they are one of the only ones I find comforatble to use due to the slant of the two sides of keys.
4,Solid Keyboard,"Nice Keyboard. A bit simple and the delete key is a small and it's easy to hit the wrong key over there in the cluster of home, page up, page down, end, delete and insert.Besides that, the keys are very comfortable to hit and not to loud either.It's working fine so far and a good deal.I'd buy it again."
4,MS Ergonomic Keyboard is great,"My product arrived in a timely manner, and although it wasn't the newest version of this keyboard, I was quite happy with it. It was in new condition as advertised, and I was able to plug it in and start using it without any problems. My fingers and wrists are very happy!"
2,Instructions would be nice,"I remember when researching the products that there was one with very specific instructions about how to use the product. When this product showed up there were no instructions, nothing, not a hint as to what to do with them. As of this moment, I haven't used them because I'm not sure how to use them."
2,Not much help if this is the first time you are using them,"The Zip lock bag the Peat Soil Pellets came in has no full name on it, no description of the product, and no instructions on how to use the product. It only has a sticker label with a bar code and part of the name with ""..."" replacing the middle words. I can't even find good instructions on the internet. How much water do I use? Do I add the water to it or soak it? Do I need to keep adding water every few days while they are growing? Do they have to be in a green house thing or can I just put it on my sunny windowsill until it's ready to be planted since it stands by itself?I was really excited to use them to get my seeds going; now I'm just frustrated..."
4,Getting to Know Italy,This book is an excellent introduction to Italy for primary school aged children. It needs to be updated so that variable statistics such as population are current and not 17 years out of date
1,"Very Poor ""Documentary""","Don't waste your money. One critic is too ""cool"" to like the Moodies, so why is he on this DVD? The other critic is ambivalent. The interviews on the stereo mix are often buried below the music. Other than some insights into the early days, a few comments by Derek Varnals and their publicist, there is nothing worthwhile here. After ""In Search of the Lost Chord,"" subsequent albums are basically covered in 1 sentence. There is footage of Patrick Moraz, but no mention that Mike Pinder left the group! And there is nothing about the Moodies after ""Octave."""
1,abysmal,"It's rare that I don't finish a book, but after two-thirds of this disaster, after it became clear that it was getting worse, not better, I finally gave up. I even considered sending it back to Mr Dillon. Ghastly. Awful characters, silly plot, contrived scenarios and -- oh, what's the on floor? -- ANOTHER NAME. RUN, DON'T HIDE FROM THIS!"
3,Not much of a mystery,I recommend this story to someone who likes silly stories - it starts out as a mystery but turns into nothing.
5,Riveting,"""Righteous Revenge"" by Beverly J Scott was a really good book. I enjoyed her characters and the fact that she kept me guessing clear to the end. If you like mystery and romance you will like this book."
4,La Strada Del' Amore,"I Love This Song And I Search For Any Artist That Record This Song//I Have Loved This Song Ever Since I Heard Caterina ValenteSing This On A RCA 45 Record/What A Performance//Roberto Cardinali Does A Very Nice Performance/Stanley CooperJupiter,Floida"
3,Refund of Purchase,"Tally Counter w/ Finger Ring, SilverEven though I did not receive this product. The company is doing everything to refund me my money."
2,Didn't Really Like IT!,"I ordered two of these. One was broken by the time it was opened (cracked on top). My daughter still uses it but it's too small to hold movies, etc. Too expensive - not worth the $. Breaks easy."
2,"no, not painful...but far too anesthetic","I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band. All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception. Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I. A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band. If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total. If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like ""Painful."" But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia."
4,Initial D,"i could not possibly give the 'Tokyo Pop' versions of initial D a five star rating due to the differences from the original show in japan v/s the 'Tokyo Pop' version. I've noticed that their are scenes that are cut out from the 'Tokyo Pop' version, but understandibly maybe bot suitable for kids and some of weak composure.then again, i truly love the show, and must support it."
2,Not what I expected at all,"The questions were very superficial and not at all what I expected. I wanted to get into the guts of a relationship but this was not the book for that.It came in good time, the transaction was great, but the book was not."
1,Disappointing - Nothing New,I started to read the book and decided to return it.I found that the ideas presented nothing really new.I did not like the examples.I bought this book because it got excellent reviews on Amazon.com and found out that it did not match my expectations.
3,some good points but very out of date,"The author has much of value to say regarding the need to encourage children rather than criticize them, the benefit of avoiding power struggles and the egotistical need to be obeyed, and the increasing democratization of the family. However, his promotion of the dicredited, antiquated, and harmful techniques of schedule feeding infants and leaving them alone to cry betray the great age of this book and the incompleteness of the author's approach. In addition, passages in the book such as, ""A child's purpose in life is to attend school just as a father's is to go to work and a mother's is to maintain the home.."" and, ""the current social crises of the integration of the negro into modern society"" make it difficult to take this book seriously. The publisher should consider revising the contents of the book and not just the cover."
5,This book outlines a logical and easy to follow approach to raising children,"Children the Challenge deals with logical consequences. It outlines a great approach for dealing with children of all ages, even adult children. It is a great book."
5,Great item!,"Other than it's a tad long for the area I wanted it for, it's a great organizer, and makes it very easy to flip through the CD's. I'm using the slim cases, and they fit beautifully."
3,Love what happens...just wish for better writing.,"I am an animal lover, a huge reader, and a well-educated person. This is a book I should have loved, and I was touched by the actual story itself...but the writing left something to be desired. Lots of repetition. I appreciate Phillip's attempts at writing, but the publisher should have helped a little before releasing this book."
4,Cute.,Not a super exciting read by any means but a cute story. I have a dog that loves cats so I can relate. The world needs more people willing to help animals like this man.
4,This is a good mix.....Summer heat to last a while.,"The songs on this album is all good. It has to be. When u have people like mary J., K-ci and jojo, etc. Some songs like ""You"", Beatuiful,etc. u have heard already. Others are either comingout soon or just never made it big. Overall I would get this for just chilling out doing some work or just if u have someone over for dinner or something. It could have been better in some of the remixes which is why I rated it a 4..but it's good overall.get it!"
3,Risky business,"The book was very good. Always like Nora,s books. Fast easy read. Risky Business. Can't wait for a new trilogy."
5,OF COURSE i LOVE IT,"Its always nice to get your favorite author instantly and now I can read it on all my devices so much easier, Very good book,"
4,Good reading,Enjoyed evey twist and turn in this book. Can't wait for it to be made into a movie. Love Nora Roberts
4,Great book,Another great story by nora roberts.It was a fun read that i could not put down.Can't wait for the next
3,Predictable,"Once again Ms Roberts has done her research and sets the scene well, but once again boy meets girl and right away you can predict the out come."
4,Very good,Good Book but high points needed to be little more detailed would of made more exciting. I would tell others to read.
5,Great,"Their isn't a book that Nora writes that I don't like. Have a real problem, because I read then to fast and then I have to wait such a long time before another one comes out. I do read other writers but not as fast. They just don't hold my interest as long. Love Nora's books an have been reading her books since 1985.Thanks"
4,Risky business,I enjoyed the book of kept my interest clear through the book. I would highly recommended it to friends. I give it 4 stars.
3,Average.,Not compelling in plot or characterization. A bit of mystery and mundane romance. Warm setting for New England blizzard season.
5,Nora Roberts,I think Nora Roberts is a very good writer. I have no idea how she puts out so many books though. It is amazing to me and I have enjoyed everyone I have read.
2,roundabout,"Here we go again,, same old same old sorry I bought would like to return it.. I will not recommend this to a friend"
4,Always love Nora Roberts,"Nora Roberts, what else needs to be said? Great characters and descriptions, and as always the guy gets the girl."
4,Creative,Quite the creative story.Enjoyable with all the twists and turns in the story line.A sequel would be great..what happened next.
2,Doesn't meet specs,The specifications say the door chime kit has a transmission range of 150 feet. We can get no more than 25 feet. This was only done after swapping out the transmitter and changing the battery. Poor product.
4,Great Door Chime,I was looking for a lazy way to install a new door chime. This was the answer. A very good product.
3,"Good reading, but.....","A very passionate, painful look at alternative lifestyles in the 50's. I wish the author could've explored more about this ""love"" that Joss and Millicent had. No words on how they loved or why Millie was so willing to carry on their love affair after realizing who Joss really was. I think there is a message to be given in their relationship of love having no boundaries and the author could've explored that. Love, pain, misery, joy and relief all in this well written story of alternative lovestyles."
5,A powerful story of love and identity,"Clearly based on the life of Billy Tipton, Kay's first novel is a beautiful story exploring the ideas of identity, parenthood, and love in much the same manners as Emma Donoghue, Keith Ridgway, and Colm TÃ³ibÃ­n. Joss Moody, the celebrated African-Scottish jazz trumpeter, dies, and his widow retreats to their remote Scottish cottage to mourn. Their adopted son Colman, and the rest of the world, are shocked to discover that Joss was biologically female. Colman spirals into anger and falls victim to a tabloid journalist intent on a gossipy bio of Joss Moody, but he ultimately comes to terms with his father and himself. What resonated the most with me was the focus on Colman coming to a new realization of his relationship with his father. Kay's style is wonderful, and justifies the Lambda Literary Award it won."
4,Excellent!,"Terrific book, mesmerizing. I could not put it down. Beautifully written, exciting story.Well done, Ms Kaye!"
5,sign of greatness,This is a great christian film. I love to see the christians win in the end. Even though were killed by Nero they refuse to denounce Jesus and Fredic March charather went to be with the woman he loved.
2,Surprisingly dreary for De Mille,"Obviously intended as a pretty blatant ripoff of earlier movie versions of Quo Vadis (although the play it is based on was first performed in 1895, the year Sienkewicz's novel was first published), it's hard to believe just how monotonous and relentlessly static De Mille manages to make The Sign of the Cross. Claudette Colbert and Charles Laughton are fun as Poppea and Nero, but they're hardly in the picture, far too much time being taken up with Frederic March hamming it up as Marcus Superbus (no, really) as he falls for Elissa Landi's Christian gal Mercia (no relation to the county). It's restrained to the point of being inert at times, with far too much of the dreary Christians, although it does perk up for the arena finale which features dwarfs battling Amazon women, elephants crushing Christians and gorillas menacing naked women. The last 15 minutes aside, Dreary with a capital D.No extras but a decent black and white transfer."
3,"Only 1 song ""Bells""- not the 6 listed","I bought this LP thinking there were 6 songs on it like it was advertised, but when I opened the vinyl I come to find that there is only 1 song, and the vinyl is clear and not black, which isn't a big deal but also isn't advertised. For $9.99 new I guess one song is mildly satisfying, but certainly not what I expected. I don't know why or how this LP posting lists 6 songs when another Bells vinyl LP lists only 1 song ""Bells"", which is actually as it is. For the 1 song, it plays well, but come on Amazon or whoever else is at fault, list it correct!Here's the other ""Bells"" LP link to show it correctly listed:http://www.amazon.com/Bells-Vinyl-Albert-Ayler/dp/B002DT14YC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1335275842&sr;=8-2"
3,Being Greedy,"This book is a book about a kid named randy and his friends.When his mother makes cookies he didnt want to share and eats the leftovers.After that he throws a fit and his friends leave because of the way he acts.Later in the day he sees his friends under the tree Eating candy .They offer to let him have some the split them up evenly and he says""Ill never begreedy again.""That was a really good book written by Joy Berry.his is just of of many books she writes for little kids.It helps them learn how do be have and act right."
5,A Blast From the Past!,"Connie Francis was one of my favorites from my younger days. This CD was perfect for recapturing some of the fond memories from those days. Until recently, I knew very little about the ""ups & down"" in her personal life and career. I plan to buy her autobiography, ""Who's Sorry Now"" to help me understand, on a more personal level, why such a wonderful singer seemed to lose her happiness in life. If you like her music, buy this CD--I don't think you will be disappointed!"
1,Great Book!!!! Easy to Read and Understand,I bought this book for a motor development class along with another one and this book is definitely the better one of the two. The other book is too slow to read and the authors do a bit too much self advertising in the book.
2,Whats the big deal ????,"I dont see how people can call this epic or one of the best releases of the year. I find the album to be boring. The overdubbing of the vocals just ruins the music; not that the music is anything to rave about. I would say that this album, and the newest Nile album, Annihilation of the Wicked are the two most over-hyped death metal albums of 2005Instead of picking this up, I would get older Morbid Angel or Severe Torture."
5,Thought Provocking and Incredible,"Willy Porter takes on life's issues in Dog Eared Dream. From ex-loves to current loves are all told beautifely and simply. Watercolors is one of my all time favorite songs, everytime I listen to it I visualize the song. Also listen to the irony in Jesus on the Grill. If I could I'd give this album 10 stars on the 5 star scale!"
2,Dissapointed,"I got this album having never heard Willy Porter before, but having heard him compared to G Love and Jack Johnson. While I like the latter two, I was dissapointed in Willy Porter. It was a bit slower, not as funky as the other two with a bit of a religious overtone. Just not my cup of tea."
3,One plane swing or Rotary Swing?,"First let me say I am a fan of both rotary and the Hardy one plane swing. In this DVD chuck Quinton, creator of rotary swing, is advocating more of the traditional hardy one plane swing. But my ok rating is that this is only a thirty minute video and if you are looking for an indepth analysis of one plane swinging this is not for you. It gives a ""cliffs note"" if you will take one plane swing and three drills to help the beginner well, begin. My advice would be to take the money for this DVD and put it towards Chuck Quinton's website or Hardy's website it will serve you better. I think Chuck Quinton is an awesome teacher and his website is great but this DVD is not for rotary swing. This is the RS1 swing not the RST, this was Quinton first swing theory."
4,Great Fun,"Bought this for my 2 year old son. Him and his little buddies have such a blast chasing each other through tunnels and sitting in the hut. It's definitely not made to last forever, especially with the way my little fella shakes its and drags it around, but so far it's stood up to his rough handling, so we're happy and I would certainly recommend this playhut...on my ""Birthday gift ideas"" list :)"
2,That's not an Abrams.,"The Box on the image specifically says ""Type 90"". How will people buy this if they don't know if they'll get an actual Abrams tank. they better rename the product or change the image if they want to sell."
5,So Much Better,"These kids are just awesome, all the songs are really really good, my favorites are I Just Came to Dance and Day you came. they're more disco than before, and it's just great!!! I love this Cd, I'm always listening to it. Buy it and you won't regret."
1,Can everyone stop calling each other freaks,"Everyone has their own opinion, and mine is that these guys stink, but dont call people freaks because they like this stuff."
5,Pukka little book,"I was recommended this book by Tim Ferris (in his book 4 hour work week).. I made a not of it in my wish list, and finally 2 years later I bought it..I thought it was a really good book and inspiring. Its a short book so easy to get through. Ive made a note to re-read it again in 6 months time because I really think the material is worth reading.Most of all, I got his 'attitude' to time getting wasted by other people and distractions and realise you have to stand up to protect your time.Good read"
4,The take no prisoners guide to improving your productivity,"This is the tough love, take no prisoners guide to improving your productivity. A hilarious read in parts especially ""Meetingitis"" and Mr-have-you-got-a-minute the Time Vampire.One thing I didn't understand is Mr Kennedy's dislike for people who enjoy doing their own gardening. Sure you could pay someone to do it but then you would need to pay for a gym to get exercise, and some kind of therapy to help you relax, when you could have just had fun by pottering around your garden.Overall this book is bound to get you fired up one way or another."
3,"Silly, but fun","Nursery Crime Squad detective Jack Spratt, constable Mary Mary, and alien constable Ashley (who speaks in binary) are at it again in this light pun filled satirical mash-up of nursery rhymes and detective fiction. Goldilocks has been found dead and presumably murdered after fleeing the house of the three bears. Spratt is on the case, investigating that crime along with the Gingerbread Man's murderous killing spree and the possibility that massive explosions are being caused by... cucumbers. If you enjoy deadpan punning and can have fun with a light read that skewers everything, this is a fun book."
4,Underrated Yo la Tengo,"I agree with most of the reviewers here in that this album has got to be one of their most underrated. I personally think it's superior to I can hear the heart beating as one. Not that the latter is bad. It's just that I feel that this album is more concise musically.By the way, I've always wondered why some of the tracks lenght times are all screwed up, like Blue Line Swinger at 3:15? Was this premeditated by the band or was it just a printing error? If anyone knows, please let me know."
1,A sonic mess...,"What an amazing album! Unfortunately, the sound on this release is horribly mastered. Too much digital hiss removal and heavy handed EQ spoils some brilliant music. I highly suggest the recently re-released Idle Race EMI CD set. It has problems of its own but is enjoyable nonetheless."
5,Max :(,"I could NOT believe ho this triology ended. I loved the books, they were great, i couldnt put them down, i read all three in one day, i felt like Max and Bev were people i knew, i felt like iw as apart of their love story. I saw a whole nother ending coming from things that were said earlier in the book, i did not see this ending coming at all, i had not been warned i wasnt ready for it, and it was like a punch in the stomach. I would love to have a 4th bokk written, i think that Nan left alot of open ends to write a 4th book with, i want to know waht happens to Bev. All three books are great, but dont buy one without all three at the same time, you will want to sit down and read all three. And be warned, the ending is extremly sad. But still good, done very tastefully."
2,Horrible ending,"This book almost ruined a good trilogy. It wasnt even the book, it was the ending. There is nothing wrong having a tragic ending, although i think too many romantically inclined books feel the need to end on a downer. It seemed like it was thrown in there as an after thought, 'and he flies to chicago where his true love is waiting..oh, and then the plane crashes, The End. Thats not a twist in the plot or a jarring ending, its bad writing."
5,Delicious!!!,These are delicious! Truly raw and truly good :). Highly recommended. I like many of their other flavors as well. Great company.
1,"Imene Tapa, Music of the Cook Islands.","If you order this c.d. expecting to hear on it the beautiful joyous traditional dance music of The Cook Islands (similar to Tahitian tamure), you will be very dissapointed!. Instead of the enthusiastic forceful voices of the Cook Island Moari, all singing lovely traditional native songs accompanied by loud rythmic drumming and howls of sheer joy. Be warned, you will instead hear a female church choir singing Christian hymms. Recorded at an outdoor performance by one individual with a portable cassette recorder."
4,Yoga of Heart by Mark Whitwell,"Mark Whitwell is a brilliant yoga instructor! In the ""Yoga of Heart"" heaptly explains what is missing from some of the current yoga systems and their modern trendiness. Although a bit long-winded, the ideas he addresses are the necessary next steps for those who would like to LIVE their yoga practice."
1,Too Small for 58mm Filters,The pockets vary in size and some are too small for 58mm filters. My cir-pl will only fit in one out of the six pockets. Two of the pockets won't even fit a ND filter. Some are ok if I really force it but I don't want to have to do that all the time.
2,"Adorama Slinger Filter Wallet ""A-6",very tight fit for the stated 58mm size lens/ filter. would better fit a 52mm and smaller. you will really mark up you filters when pulling them out of the pockets.
5,Overcoming Odds,"Davina McKie is the only daughter of Jamie and Leana McKie (the subjects of Thorn in My Heart, Tender is the Rose, and Whence Came a Prince.) Davina has not been able to speak since she was younger, but has found ways of communicating, one way throw a fiddle.Her younger brothers are sent away to school, and as they have always protected Davina Jamie is worried about her. Then he sends her to a cousins house on the Isle of Arran for the summer. Davina has the time of her life getting to know her cousins who are just about her age, when a request was made to play for the Duke of Hamilton.While there she meets Summerland McDonald who takes a shine to her. Unfortunately this leads to several tragedies that befall her while on the Island.While there are some cheerless parts of the book, the way that the book ends makes up for it."
3,"Murphy's Law - a good disc, but I expected more","This disc is just an average rap cd, nothing spectacular. It just shows that most superstars proteges have a hard time doing it on their own. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really wanted more from Murphy Lee. However, he's young and I'm sure there will be more to come from him. A good disc for a true hip hop fan, but not for the average fan."
1,You've gotta be kidding.,"If you bought this, I suggest in the future if you have money to burn then donate it to the needy."
1,20 year old rap fan who likes rappers,"aight just to talk to you bout dis thang it was off tha hook, knaw wha um sayin. Dogg, hook yourself up with this and youll be illin an thangs. If ya'll peoples in tha shizel dont like it, do one thang get back cuz you know we be talkin bout thangs. where i'm form we aint got know thangs. Knaw wha um sayin. y'all feel me. so ah buy dis and play it in on your tv an thangs, peace yo."
3,"More original emotion, less filler please!","I've been a Mindy McCready fan since her outstanding debut, ""Ten Thousand Angels"". Her last album, ""IF I Don't Stay The Night"", was better than this collection by far. Although, both are blatently commercial. This slick collection has no staying power at all. Even jukeboxes will be puking this one up. No lyrics are included, not so strange considering simple simon songs like ""Lucky Me"". I almost feel guilty giving my honest opinion on this one since I really loved ""Ten Thousand Angels"". Do yourself a favor save your money or pick up her debut."
3,Second best Mindy CD,"Her debut is still the best, but there are some very intimate and fun songs on here. ""Dream On"" is dreamy, and ""Hold Me"" is a ballad with thoughtful romantic lyrics. ""All I Want Is Everything"" is a fine rockabilly type, and ""Tumble And Roll"" will also get you moving. ""I've Got A Feeling"" completes those good harder songs with its uniqueness. ""Lucky Me,"" with its violins, is a guilty pleasure. ""Thunder And Roses"" and ""Take Me Apart"" are also worth checking out."
5,Awesome album!,"Mindy's new album is superb; she has a great voice, and her song ""Over and Over"" is one of the greatest songs on the album. She gets better w/ each album. This album was absolutely worth the money!"
3,"Period piece yes, but too predictable","Mark Rylance is very good in his role, Kristin Scott Thomas too. But the movie in general is only good (there is the book). A lot of the story suffers because of Patsy Kensit. I remember that she was ""HOT"" at the time so she probably was given this role for that reason. An extremely unattractive woman and even more so here. You learn to dislike her character but never as much as disliking her in the role. Too much commentary from me could spoil the movie, but you will figure it out yourself at least by the time they are at the ball."
5,PART NOT FOR CHILDREN,"THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE THERE IS FULL FRONTAL NUDITY, BOTH MALE AND FEMALE. YOU MIGHT NOT WANT YOUNG CHILDREN TO WATCH THOSE PARTS. GORGEOUS PERIOD PIECE."
3,Great Movie - Horrible Disk,"I will let others comment on the movie, and I agree with most of the positive comments it is receiving. HOWEVER - I am a big DVD buff, and picture quality is very important to me. This is probably the single WORST transfer of a movie from film to digital media that I have EVER seen (Save RAN). The quality wavers from mediocre to downright horrible throughout the movie, and it was so distracting, I really could not get into the film. C'mon MGM, couldn't you have spent a LITTLE more time and attention to get this right??? It is such a visually stunning movie, and to see it this way really disappointed me..."
2,This Beast lacks bite,"This book is the forth on Benchley's that I have read, and it just seemed like a re-right of the others. Creature was much more exciting and suspenseful. I liked the character of Whip Darling, but thought he and his mate, Mike, could have been fleshed out better. Most of the plot was predictable and seemed to follow Jaws closely. I also thought the ending was weak and just did not have that ""got to read"" to find out what is going to happen. The story would have been much better if the secondary characters were more exciting. I recommend skipping this one and reading The Deep instead; both stories take place in Bermuda and The Deep is much better. However, if you are a Benchley fan, I would give it a go. Luckily, the book was much better than the TV movie that was out a few years ago."
5,Big things come in small packages,"The small size of the Bible makes this a wonderful, convienient book. I keep it in my purse for reference at any time. I have given copies away as gifts. What a wonderful way to keep ""The WORD"" with you at all times. Small enough for your glove compartment, vest pocket, or night stand at home. I highly recommend it!"
5,The Smallest Bible (NKJV),"PROS:The Smallest Bible (NKJV) is perfect for carrying with me everywhere. It is small enough to fit in my pocket or to carry in my backpack. The snap closure is a nice touch, seeing as I keep it in some small places where it could get torn easily. The print is small, but it comes with a magnifying card.CONS:The paper is thin so when I highlight passages the ink bleeds through sometimes. Also, for people with bad eyesight or focusing problems the print is very small, but after all it is the Smallest Bible. If this bothers you, you may want to use a bit bigger pocket sized Bible."
2,Binding comes apart,The binding is coming apart and the pages near the end of the Bible are on th brink of falling out. The glue work is shabby as well. Not a very durable Bible...
5,This was a great gift,"I cannot tell you how excited my daughter was to receive this along with the first season. That made the gift just that much more wonderful, and she was delighted. It is in great shape, and it was very reasonably priced, so this was a winning choice all around."
4,A Good buy,Enjoyed the creepie crawlies it gave me-the footage was surpisingly clear. It was all I anticipated and more -Just was one thrill ride after another! Don't know what I can follow up with after watching this.
3,"Eh, it's enjoyable enough",Lost Tapes is an okay show about mythical creatures. I know a lot of people don't like it and I haven't given a damn what another person has thought in years. I like it because it tells a story about a person who has come face to face with the targeted creature. Who the hell cares if it's real or not! It's frekin reenactment so yes that is a prop. Get over the fact that it looks fake. It is fake. All the show is here for is to try to scare you and keep you entertained for an hour. Give you a couple of fun facts and history on the creature. Another reason I like it. It doesn't focus on the same god damned creatures. How many times have you heard about vampires and Bigfoot? Just enjoy the show or go do something else.
1,Silly! Silly! Silly!,"When I bought this item, I thought I was buying a real-time, scientific study of cryptozoology. What I got was a series of stupid, fictionalized, very badly-acted accounts of what may or may not have been attacks by various mythological beasts. It was like watching episode after episode of the inane Blair Witch Project with different monsters in guest-starring roles. My favorite laughable moment was towards the end of the section on the Chupacabra when a thermal camera picks up three people being chased through the desert by an image who looks to be about the size and romping friskiness of a German Shepherd puppy.In my opinion, this series was a total waste of money. My advice? Anyone who is in search of a good education about cryptozoology as well as a well-done, technology-based search for said creatures should opt instead for Destination: Truth."
2,Poorly Done,"Some of what is claims are ""lost tapes"" are actually fictionalized recreations....and poorly done ones at that. I don't recommend."
3,Yu-gi-og cards,I like these boosters packs and also good promo cards inside. I will order more in the future from them.
2,Disappointment,"Overall, the story had a good plot, but I have to honestly say that I was disappointed with this book. The main character's, Nora Blackbird, thoughts became incomplete towards the end. It seemed as though the author was just tired of writing and ended the book. Without giving anything away, I will say that at least two of the conclusions reached by Nora were pulled from thin air. There was no mention of even how the character came up with the solutions. It just did not make any sense. Also, the book seemed unfinished. There was an issue that seemed unresolved. I just feel as though the author left the audience hanging on more than one occasion."
3,It's ok...,"My elementary P.E students enjoyed this video during our fitness unit. I however, thought it was low budget. The sound quality was not good, the instructor talks to the children in the video but you can not hear their reply."
3,Like Barrett not enough music,"Sadly, not enough tracks. For the completist. Barrett is an example of a rocker who didn't die young and evaporated. But his brief spark before he burnt out is a life lesson and enjoyable but gripping music."
4,"Mixed Review - 4 stars, but really a 2","I have mixed feelings about this movie. I really thought when I bought it it was just going to be that first episode which started the tv series. I loved that first episode. But what I found was that it was a compilation of several episodes. It flowed smoothly, but I am really not a Linda Hamilton fan. I had only watched the show for Vincent - certainly not for Katherine who I might have liked if the character was played by someone other than Linda. Linda Hamilton played the role too crybaby dramatic and she always got on my nerves even back when I was watching the series. I just wish there was more Vincent in the movie instead of it being mostly her."
5,Amazing.,Brutal and fast with killer vocals =entombed--finest work and not evne a bit dissapointing! If you don't like this and yet you call yourself a metalhead then you should get beat down for being retarted. Best songs? Drowned & suppost to rot two great songs if you into this album by sepultura's early albums not the new albums!
3,It's ok,This movie is ok if you want to see the grungy side of street life so I got what I ordered but more than I wanted to see. The movie is what it says it is. I just did not like it.
3,Huh?,Why does the photograph depict a Battlestar Galactica Raptor on a Star Wars stand? Have the Cylons joined forces with the Evil Empire? Did I miss that movie?
2,Candlemaking for fun & profit,"This book is vague at best. There is not alot of specific info on making candles or running a business. This is an OK book if you find it used and cheap, but your money is better spent on a different book if you want specific technical info on how to make candles."
4,Interesting,Many of the information on profits are obviously according with US Renevue service and financial topics in that country
1,Awful! Should be recalled!,"I would have rated this book zero stars, but that isn't an option, so I had to rate it one star. It doesn't deserve that. I bought the book and started to work through the projects. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book. There were compile errors in their code and nothing ran! That's the case in two out of two projects. I've e-mailed the authors to see if there are corrections for the book, but overall I am very unimpressed."
1,Grounds for child abuse,"This is the perfect CD to play to a child as punishment! My sister gave me this recording for my little one (he's 2) and he cried when I played it. I told her that next time I see her, I'm gonna jam that CD up her wazoo!"
3,Western TV Series,"This is a 1957 serial that shows the adventures of Captain Tom Rynning (Tris Coffin) and his team of 26 rangers. Volume 1 includes episodes 1-4, and an appearance by Robert Blake. Stories are 'so-so.' Main reason for watching this was that the series was filmed in Arizona, and the main set was about two miles away from where we live. (Nothing remains - burned down in 1967, though housing development across the street is named 'Cudia Estates' after the name of the former studio.) Some local settings were recognizable, though hard to be certain given that the films focused on action and not scenery."
1,"Unwatchable, Boring Film","Every time I've tried to sit and watch this, I just can't get into it at all. It's slow, boring, and not at all scary. This film seems to answer the question of who really directed ""Poltergeist"". Tobe Hooper should consider himself very lucky to have been given credit for directing that which the ""master"" obviously did, Steven Spielberg. Much better ways to waste an hour and a half than this film. Avoid it."
3,"Great scare, just OK DVD","One of Hooper's last great films but a disappointment to those expecting more from the director of CHAIN SAW, FUNHOUSE is still one of the better horror movies you're ever going to see...it looks and sounds great on DVD and builds slowly to a knockout climax, but I understand Universal has no interest in putting this on DVD the way it's meant to be, with the original poster art and tag line (the monster's drooling mouth and the words ""Something is ALIVE in the Funhouse!"", interviews with the cast and director of the reportedly troubled production, and the original theatrical trailer...and I could've sworn I saw added/different footage on a recent cable airing. Still highly recommended."
4,Good sealing,"I use lots of padded envelopes for a small on line business. These are the best. Better than U-Line or Jiffy padded envelopes. Better because their glue seal better and stonger. Once these seal, there is no way to open them without cutting them open. Also, the kraft paper under the seal is nice and thick so the product can noit rip thru the bag at the seal."
1,Terrible book conditions,I paid $58.00 for a used version and the condition of the book was terrible. I have bought used books before this is the first time I received such a terrible quality book for the $ I paid. I will never buy from them again.
5,GREAT BOOK FOR PARTNERS OF SURVIVORS,"As a partner of a survivor, I have found that this book is one of the best written for Partners of surivivors of Sexual Abuse. Ms Gil writes in a clear, concise manner for everyone to understand. Each chapter is laid out with guidelines, exercises and tips on how to help your partner through one of the most difficult journeys of anyones life: recovering of Sexual Abuse."
3,Helpful information on Activities.,"My focus on this book was Level 2 with a focus on Software Subcontractor Management. It clarified some of the Activities, and tied them into their related goals, but there was no information on Measurement and Analysis, or Verification. The book is liberally sprinkled with graphics which are poorly drawn and, at least to me, not at all helpful. I finally just ignored them, and used only the written part. Overall, it was helpful, but I hope to find something with more specific information on how to actually implement the steps needed for CMM Level 2."
3,Problems,"This is my first DVD player; I bought it about 2 years ago without knowing much about my options. When I got it, I didn't have an AV receiver, so I didn't notice the lack of an optical audio connection. The first thing I did notice is that my universal remote didn't have a listed code, and it didn't find one by searching.Currently, the player is connected to a Yamaha HTR-5450 receiver. I've noticed some audio synch problems for a while, which really bug me, but don't seem to bother my girlfriend. Recently, I've also had a lot of trouble with discs freezing or skipping. This occurs with both brand new and old discs, and is rarely helped by cleaning. I haven't gone to the trouble to test the discs on other players to determine for sure where the fault is, but I'm pretty sure it's the KLH. I've read that both the skipping and the audio synch problems are related to an ill-defined set of standards for DVD, and many older players have been reported to have trouble with newer discs."
1,ONE riser!,"The picture clearly shows six risers and the price would reflect that but I received one, packaged in a taped plastic baggy."
5,Very nice,As someone who logs over 20 hours a week on a soldering iron this my favorite.-The tips longevity is great just like the Weller brand. (Have never had good luck with Hakko tips except for the Hakko 808 but thats not a iron)-Iron lacks advanced features like auto-shutoff but for the price I wouldn't expect it.-I think this is the best iron in this price range for beginners to professionals. I would like to use it more but my work uses Hakko. The iron does not fit that well in the stand (old version) but is way better than the spring ones that Hakko and Weller uses on lower end models. If you plan on soldering 0402 parts or 8 gauge wire this is a pretty good iron to do it.Irons I use regularly....-Weller WESD51 ->logged about 400 hrs-Hakko 928 ----->logged 1000+ hrs-Hakko 936 ----->logged 1000+ hrs-Hakko 808 ----->logged 1000+ hrs-Aoyue 937+ ---->logged about 300 hrs
3,GREAT when it doesn't break.,"I used this iron a lot during a project I was working on. It work with no problems till about a two months after having it the iron broke were the plastic screws it all together. I think it is partially the fault of the holder. That is were the break happened. I think the weight of the cord and the back side of the iron might have been too much weight for the plastic to handle. It was hard to find a replacement iron, but I eventually did find one. I still use this thing, and I still do like it, but with it was built just a little better. Another thing is that the sponge when wet is way to big for the holder. It's not that big a deal, but it's worth mentioning I believe."
1,Terrible design,"Had this soldering iron over two years now. Hate almost everything about it. It doesn't seem to make temperature, ir thermometer sets it at about 50 degrees less than the digital read out shows. The iron itself is a two piece design which allows for the ceramic heating element to be changed. This would be a nice feature however, the nut that holds the two pieces together expands when it gets hot (its on an soldering iron). When it expands it slips and the iron become crooked and unusable. You then have to wait for it to cool (or burn your fingers) and replace the nut, only to start the process over again.Do yourself a favor, spend the extra 20 dollars and just buy a weller. I regret my purchase."
1,Pencil Iron Does Not Fit the Holder - Unusable,"Well - - THAT was a waste of time. It got GREAT reviews, so I bought one. Tried putting it together - and the Pencil Iron DOES NOT FIT into the Holder! Not Even Close! It's supposed to slide into the angled holder so the tip won't touch anything - but the ribbed ferule is TOO BIG to fit into the hole! So the thing just kind of flops around, which is NOT what you want it to do when the tip is at 800 degrees!.This is an obvious Manufacturing Defect - OR - they changed the iron or the holder and put the pieces in the wrong box (what I received certainly does match the picture on Amazon though). I will take a couple of photos showing the problem & post..I did NOT even turn the thing on - so can't post a functional review. Back in the Box it goes - RMA has already been processed and labels printed. Just gotta LOVE Amazon for their pain-free return policy! I would much rather have bought a properly designed soldering station!"
1,Not what I had hoped for...,"Upon receiving the book, the first thing I noticed was the cover as advertised on the internet is different from the actual book. OK, I can live with that. However, as I read the book, I found that It just doesn't live up to its subtitle; ""A Complete Look At The Use, Care & Repair The 1911 Pistol"". In my opinion, it speaks more to Gunsmiths, and people already in the know, so to speak, than it does to someone interested in learning about the 1911-A1 pistol.Unlike many other gun publication that educate the reader through words and pictures, on a step by step basis, this book jumps right into techical jargon that was very difficult to follow and for someone new to the 1911, I found this very frustrating. Perhaps, for the reader interested in modifing their own 1911-A1 pistol, this book will be of some interest. This is not to say the book doesn't provide some useful information. Perhaps volume 1 might be more helpful."
3,1911 vol2 review,"This book is somewhat interesting reading for anyone that has a 1911. It doesn't contain much info. on the care & cleaning (exploded views, etc.)"
4,Love the Oil....Not the Bottle,"Great oil, moisturizing and I love the smell; no nasty fillers!! However, this needs to be in a glass bottle. The oil hardens in colder temperatures and needs to be reheated...which is fine, but you can't microwave the plastic bottle. I had purchased some of this oil when I went to Tahiti several years ago and it was in a glass bottle, which is much better to microwave and helps the product last longer. The oil gets a 5 stars....the bottle gets no stars. I would definitley buy again, but I will try to find it in a glass bottle."
2,Oil or solid?,"I am unsure if this is the way it was intended, but this product is more of a solid than a lotion. Therefore, it is so difficult to get the product out of the bottle. The fragrance is very, very strong."
2,Black spoon rest,This is a nice spoon rest but has a wobble to it and really doesn't set flat. Not a major problem though.
1,Don't buy irish music group version,There is painful hissing in between almost every track and the last track is cut completely off. Waste of money.
3,Better than others - but embedded tacks may break teeth,"It's the best chewable habitat I've seen. We had a different model our gerbil demolished -- but that model was painted bright colors. I suspect it was somewhat toxic to chew on, though our gerbil survived.This is unpainted and seems as safe a habitat as one could buy. Only 3 issues:1. The label was a nuisance to remove.2. It's tacked together, so hope the gerbil can figure that out.3. It's made in China, so we can only cross fingers and hope it really is relatively non-toxic.Update: Well, four issues. Our gerbil is a manic chewer, and he chewed into a tack on a similar structure. He broke a tooth, which the abscessed. He's now the 150 dollar gerbil, recovering post-op. This wood hut has similar tacks holding it together. If Kangaroo recovers fully, we'll cut this structure apart and build him something held together by string."
5,Glad I paid for this,"Highly recommended.Previously I used cardboard boxes with sections cut out for entry and windows. My pig loved those and would immediately start to nibble on them. They were free and lasted about three months. I ensured that there was no ink, tape or labels on the boxes.I purchased this recently, and my pig loves it, of course. He's already sticks his head out the top and the side window. I think that this is better for him, because it will help his teeth wear down better than a cardboard box. I don't see any dangers in my guinea pig using this.The construction is very good, no loose pieces. It's also size appropriate. Great product, fast shipping and arrived in good condition."
3,nostalgic dessert glasses,"Beautiful dessert glasses, look like old ice cream waffle cone. Arrived with 2 broken in original box & on free 2nd shipment to replace(Thanks, Amazon) same problem. Original sender should double wrap each glass in 2 or more layers of bubblewrap."
3,"Shoddy cd case, but several musical gems...","My brother had originally bought the 12"" vinyl single way back in the early 80's, and even today (2008) I still wanted to go back and hear ""Revolutionary Spirit"" and ""God Forbid."" I knew the expense would be worth it for only a couple songs. These two are that wonderful.For me, though, most of this is 80's pop drivel--it's amazing how so many of the 80's ""alternative"" bands have that pretty-boy-romantic sound--but there are a few more treats to hear--like ""Revolutionary Spirit"" (live), ""No Bleeding"", and ""Northern England."" At least their hearts are in it, and they strived to make the songs somewhat interesting, like early Modern English and Psychedelic Furs did.One other mention is the cd case itself manufactured by Renascent UK crumbles in my hands, it's one of the worst I've every purchased, even worse than Led Zeppelin's BBC Sessions case manufactured by Atlantic. Quality means a lot to me, so I took off a star for this foolishness."
1,Acrylic Earring Keeper - Holds 37 Pair,Very Disappointed! The item was Not well pack and therefore causes the product with some damaged. i feel it is not as useful as i thought. Quantity of the product also pretty lbad. Not worth the money at all!!! I will not recommend it to anyone!
3,I love/hate it!,"I have this sitting on top of the 7 drawer acrylic unit. Together they look amazing and the display of my jewelry is wonderful. However, as someone else noted, it is NOT easy to attach the earrings to holders. I have to use hemostats to hold them into place and if I drop part or all of it I then have to fish it out, thankfully the hemostats are long. There is one other very disappointing problem...the door is hinged by tiny screws on either end. After a month of very little use, the door is now falling off because the one side is split where the screw was driven into it. I should have returned it instantly but I was so excited about getting it and loading my earrings into it that I thought I could live with the problem."
5,A++,"Excelente, buen item, llego perfecto y en buen estado, empaque fÃ¡cil de abrir, 100% satisfecho, lo recomiendo a toda la comunidad"
4,Cool,"Not quite what I expected, but still pretty good. I thought the rhymes had been rewritten with an Addams twist, but its the usual rhymes with Addams pictures. :)"
5,Worth every penny for this import...,"I have remained a fan of A-ha's for many years, but only recently learned of Morten's solo albums. This is the first one I was able to get my hands on, and wow! There is a depth both to his vocalizations and the music itself, and a wonderful variety of sound. This is not a cookie cutter album, and Morten makes excellent use of the flexibility that comes with recording solo. Terrific and insightful lyrics as well. These songs grab you and won't let go. My next acquisition will be his Norwegian recording. I can't wait. :-)"
2,too small,"the actual compartment for this was too small and I did return it. For the outside dimensions, little inside functionality. I know it is for your lunch, but it takes up too much space. I prefer the sack that you can attach that is large and roomy"
4,Delightful return to Harmony,"Pastor Sam Gardner is back with his quirky Quaker flock. As usual Dale Hinshaw is full of schemes to spread the Gospel. This time he has given up on Scripture eggs and is now sending Salvation Balloons which are strategically aimed at liberals and unsaved people. Sam encounters problems in his own household when he and his wife can't agree on a vacation spot and the parishioners argue over everything from putting in a new furnace to who to include in the ladies' celebrity quilt. With his usual gentle humor, Philip Gulley brings to life the colorful and quirky characters of Harmony, Indiana, much to the readers' delight!"
1,Denslow was a Illistrator?,As we all know Mr. Denslow illistrated the original WIZARD OF OZ book. I looked forward to this one until I found out that there are no illistrations. There is a discription of what should be but it's just not the same. Story probably would have been better with illistartions.
4,"Good, but not as good as Kitchen by the same author","I have read all of Banana's books in English and found this one a little disapointing. Kitchen is probably her best book. I would recommend it over this one. I enjoy Banana's poetic style of writing and also the glimpses she provides of life in modern Japan. This is a good book, but read Kitchen first."
2,Dull,"Someone said this story of Banana was poetic. Wait a munite. Noone makes that type of comments in Japan. Japanese is very differentfrom English and how can English speakers know whether writers havecreative power of their own.Banana is not the best writer from our country. Charactors she writes are so shallow that stories are almost pointless. I have read other work of hers since my best friend recommended to me, but I did not like any of them..."
3,Not a Bad Deal But There Are Far Better Deals On Far Better Prisms Available,You only get one prism with this purchase.My experience in purchasing 7 prisms through Amazon (6 different types and two of the same kind through different vendors) is that larger prisms with larger facets and the same lead content produce longer and wider rainbows as well as far more vivid colors.This is listed as a 30mm ball yet right underneath that it says in the Product Description that it's 40mm. That's a significant size difference. Mine arrived as a 30mm ball prism. Other prisms I purchased are significantly larger and cost no more when one takes shipping into account.You can get a far better prism here:76mm Teardrop Crystal Prisms #873-76.
5,What the USA is STILL all about,"Having been born out of the USA and worked and lived in France, Germany, UK (England/Scotland) and here in the USA the past 24 years (am only in my mid 40'), I have done much: I recognize true quality. This movie is a very good thank you to Daniel Ruettiger who in real life did that dream come true.Even now, in 2008 and to come, on 148 countries, how many really are true democracies? Certainly not yet in many East EU countries, a lot of China, a dozen of countries in Africa etc...America still has got the ""you can do it"" and ""dreams can come true attitude"": not bad wisdom considering that the USA is only 222 years old (since the American constitution) and not about 2500 to 3500 years old as most other countries.So, Rudy? Oui, watch it again and again if you ever doubt that dreams can come true."
3,Rudy,"Rudy (Special Edition)Rudy was an inspiring movie based upon a true story that is an example of determination and perserverence. Truly a classic.However, I truly believe that this wonderful story fell from a perfect 10 to a lower number due to some of the phrases that defame the God who made life and accomplishment possible."
1,Disappointed with service,"I'm sure we would have enoyed the movie if we had received it. We received the wrong movie and have to pay S&H to return. We feel that is Amazon's responisbility, seeing they put the wrong movie in the mailer."
3,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable the first time, might have given 4 stars but every time I see it I don't know why I liked it so much the first time around. My advice- watch it once"
4,DELUXE EDITION?,"I was waiting for a true deluxe edition that has a commentary of the making of the movie. Most of the time I won't buy a DVD unless it has a commentary on the movie. This is one of my all time favorite movie and what made me love Sean Astin as an actor. If you are looking for an inspirational, uplifting movie for you or someone else, this is it. I give the movie 5 stars but this DVD edition 4 stars."
5,"Beginners to intermediate, for dance instruction and workout.","Good for beginners to intermediate, for dance instruction and workout.I like how she demostrates/practices each move slowly, then does it fast, then combines the individual moves together into a dance sequence. She does a good job cueing the next move.This ""Bollydance"" video has a variety of cute moves, with lots of arm/hand gestures. There are many feminine moves so I would not recommend this for men."
1,"""The absence of method is the method""","""The absence of method is the method"", finally on page 246 Loporto reveals the truth. He wrote a book to make you feel good. It says absolutley nothing - but that is his method."
3,Unforgettable Fragrance,"Michael Kors by Michael Kors is a beautiful unforgettable fragrance for women. It is rich, with deep floral scents, and I think it is a somewhat sensuous scent. It is powerful without being overwhelming, when you first spray it on. But, unfortunately the fragrance that does not last long. I love the fragrance, no staying power that is why I gave it 3 stars."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!,"I ordered the small version of this simply because I was unsure if it would smell like the magazine sample I fell in love with. Now I want a huge bottle! I went to Ulta wanting to sample it, but they were out of the sample bottle. So I took a huge chance on this one.I am not normally a fan of floral scents, until now. I had no idea (until I looked it up) that there were floral scents n this. I read a few reviews and am amazed at anyone who doesn't love this. To each their own I guess. :-)My husband said it smells like soap to him. That's fine, I was worried he wouldn't like it. I don't buy perfume for him, I buy it for me. But I do want him to like how I smell. So this was a successful purchase.To me it reminds me of when I was a kid and sampled some of a family members fancy perfume. So it also has great memories attached to it.This is a great size and price to try if you are unsure, as I was."
5,Hooked,"My new scent. Fabulous. This perfume is for the elegant, confident sexy woman. When I wear this, my presence is paramount. Love it!"
2,Michael Kors for women,I remember smelling this in an ad and loving it but never got around to buying it because it is so expensive. So I decided to try it. I don't love it. I like it much better after a couple of hours when it seems to not be as flowery and even then the scent doesn't last very long. I will not be buying Michael Kors again. I would recommend going to a department store and spraying some on you and wearing it for a day or two before spending the money to own it. I was pretty disappointed. I did receive it quickly so that was nice.
4,"Looks good, but not for me.","I was looking for a program that requires only dumb-bells, but this one uses dumb-bells, bar-bells, a few kinds of benches, and other equipment. Since I don't have a home gym or access to a commercial gym, this book has not been useful for me. But it looks very good for someone who has the proper equipment and wants to use very heavy weights."
3,The Power Bar has a unique taste -- ...,"The Power Bar has a unique taste -- not too sweet or too bland. It was a bit chewy and dry. I liked that it was all-natural and didn't have anything artificial in it. I'd recommend it to my friends, who are very active and could use something like the Power Bar."
3,"This bar definitely gave me more energy. However, ...","This bar definitely gave me more energy. However, the taste was not good. I'm glad real chocolate chips were added. The product was very dry and had a powder consistency to it. But overall, I'd recommend it for its energy purposes."
4,This was my first experience of a Power ...,"This was my first experience of a Power Bar product. I have to say they tasted quite good! I expected them to be less palatable. They are moist and """"chocolatey"""" and taste very similar to brownies, but much more nutritious! I found myself choosing a Power Bar for a snack and then was rather pleased with myself because I was eating something good for me. I recommend them highly!"
2,little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in the taste, I felt it had an aftertaste. I love some of the other ones just not this one."
4,The Power Bar made me feel full and ...,"The Power Bar made me feel full and I had plenty of energy. The taste of the bar was not that great. All in all, I will probably buy more."
2,okay,"The IMAX Horses was probably great in the IMAX, but I wasn't that impressed as a movie played on a regular TV screen. It was nice and all, but nothing that great, and I LOVE horses."
4,"Good choice of events , easy reading",easy reading and well done. Good choice of events and good information.a little more precice would havve made things even clearer.
2,Rather Bland,"Buchwald's ""Beating Around the Bush"" takes jabs at politicians, corporations, and the media. It is comprised of a number of Buchwald's newspapers columns on current events.The humor is there, but not nearly as strong as with fellow satirists Al Franken and Bill Maher. Topics addressed include Iraq (it's the only war we've got, so we have to support it), Compassionate Conservatives (someone who wants to help the working poor, the undeducated, and the unemployed - not with money, but with prayers and tax cuts), Wal-Mart (solving one of America's biggest problems - sending jobs overseas, by keeping cleaning jobs here and bringing foreigners here to do them), and Zell Miller (had a heart transplant after giving keynote speech for Clinton in '92 - this allowed him to bash Democrats at Republican '04 Convention).I'd go with Franken or Maher instead."
5,DVD - Claudette Colbert & Don Ameche in Midnight,"""Midnight"" is a typical ""30's"" movie. Some were good, some great, and some not so good.I saw a lot of movies then as my uncle was a projectionist at the theaters here. I often watched from the projection booth, or if it was'nt too busy the loge. Of course on Saturdays a lot of the kids went to the Saturday matinee, for 10 cents. I do not remember missing many of those. I do not recall seeing ""Midnight,""probably because there were 3 theaters in town and I missed a few. This movie was made when I was 7 years old. I really enjoyed ""Midnight"" as it was funny and entertaining, and a lot of the photography in a lot of old black and white movies was very well done. Claudette Colbert was always one of my favorites, not only because she was a great actress, but because she and my mother resembled one another."
2,NOT FOR THE BEGINNER,"THIS BOOK IS MORE FOR THE SHIP HISTORIAN, NOT THE MODELER WHO IS LOOKING FOR HELP AND GUIDANCE WITH KITS. BUT NOT ALL IS LOST. THE RIGGING INFORMATION IS SOMEWHAT HELPFULL."
3,use for reference,"This is very detailed, jargon-filled discussion of the fine art of ship model building using descriptions of how ""real"" ships were built and rigged. It's not a book I'd read cover-to-cover, but use to make sure your have authentically duplicated a real ship's configurations. I'd say it's a book mostly for ""from scratch"" builders even though it's also educational for us beginners. Written in a kind of archaic style which for me meant re-reading some suntences over two or three times. The author assumes at least a fundamental knowledge of ship terminology. By studying this book's content very seriously I think you'd come away with a very complete knowledge of authentic ship-building and rigging techniques."
4,Inspiring!,These intriguing stories for singles demonstrate that people of all backgrounds and with differing personalities can find loving partners if they address the issues which keep them from finding the person who is right for them. The advice offered is sound and helpful.
5,"Finally, a book with Answers!","If you've ever been curious why some people are `lucky' in love... If you've ever wondered why some of your relationships `worked' and some didn't... If you're looking for a book that will lead you to ask the `right' questions...this is it!Here, in one little book, are ten real life examples from real people of how they faced relationship issues and solved them. Ms. Owens has a `straight-to-the-point' way of explaining an issue and then giving practical examples on how to address it.`You can't solve a problem that you can't name'. After reading this book, I felt that relationships should be fun, that `problems' were a doorway to being closer, and that there are answers for the most perplexing relationship issues.A very worthwhile read!"
2,Just ok,This not a strong scent. I mean you can barely smell it. I would like more if the scent lasted longer than 5 mins.
4,very happy with the spice drawer rack,I was looking for something that was inexpensive and easy to work with and this spice drawer insert fit the bill.
2,Misleading Capababilities Advertised,"I'm not a graphics professional, just looking for a modest editing and image browsing program for my new Mac, something comparable to ACDSee and Photoshop I used in Windows. Elements is not it. It does reasonable editing, and at about the same level of technical detail I need, but the software denies access to the bridge browsing program, saying I have to have other Adobe programs installed! Duhhh. . so now I can't even browse thumbnails of my image files with it!"
5,Excellent Product for the price...,"Although I own Photoshop 7.0 for the Mac, I use it so rarely that it takes too much time for me to re-learn the functions. Photoshop Elements brings a host of the most used features from the full version, into a streamlined easy to use application. It works very well on my Mac and does everything I need a photo editing application to do....without clutter and confusion."
1,"lousy manual, system doesn't work","Manual useless on getting pix into system. From Camera or scanner goes to i photo. No instructions to get pix from HD or CD rom into system. Open file but can't access i photo. By various drag and drop operations got pix into system. Tried to modisfy clor of specific are via Magic Wand. Outlines area but enhance>adjust color>select color, click OK but no chnage to image. Try save but refuses to do. If I can't get help, I need to return the product.John Schaffer"
5,Excellent tool for manipulating and massaging images.,Elements brings the tools of Photoshop into the hands of average users. It has nearly all the power of Photoshop with a much more intuitive and usable interface.
3,Former MMPR Geeks Will Be Amused,"I rented this movie simply because it starred Karan Ashley and Johnny Yong Bosch. I knew going in it would be cheesy and low-budget. I knew it starred two former Power Rangers and was directed (and action-choreographed) by Koichi Sakamoto, who also worked on the show, so I figured there would be some influence. So long as you go in knowing that, you're fine. For a slasher flick, there is comparatively little sex or graphic death depicted. It does, however, have a lot of the usual horror movie conventions, both in story and characters. Whether those are meant in parody or earnest, it's hard to tell. Overall, the quality of the story, acting, and production give it the feel of a student project. Though it's a bad movie, I was strangely amused by it, enough that I might consider watching it again. . . maybe at a cheesy Hallowe'en party or something. . ."
4,A fiendishly clever plot with very few errors,"I discovered Jill McGown through an Amazon recommendation and am I ever glad I found her! Her detectives, Lloyd and Hill, are by turns witty and brilliant and always very likable; her plots are deviously cunning.McGown uses an unusual style for this tale. After giving the reader five corpses in the first 50 pages, she then takes one back eleven weeks earlier and begins to unearth the secrets of the Esterbrooks, an extremely wealthy, extremely dystunctional family. Additionally, McGown structures the book like a play, with multiple acts and scenes.This is not a straightforward story; it requires that the reader pay attention. Despite all the misdirection, McGown never cheats; she even has one of the characters warn ""Never trust anything an Esterbrook says.""McGown has become one of my favorite mystery writers, and ""Plots and Errors"" is one of her best."
2,Disappointing entry in a usually enjoyable series,"The most recent entry in the Hill and Lloyd series is disappointing. The ""whodunnit"" aspect of the plot is so convoluted that you need a scorecard to keep the players, motives, and alibis straight. And, if you can keep it all straight, by the end of this maze-like mystery, you don't much care.Unfortunately, the books features very little of the relationship and chemistry between the long-time lovers Hill and Lloyd that devotees of this series have come to expect and enjoy.There's more plot in ""Plots and Errors"" than necessary and the error is in the author thinking that these endless plot twists and turns makes for a better story."
2,Not one of his best,This book was one of his early books and not very noteworthyas a piece of literature. Purchase one of his newer books.
3,I have this,"I think I paid 30 bucks for this at KMart. The magazine rack doesn't work, all the magazines fall out the bottom. The over the toilet thing has an open design, so stuff falls through all the time. The white metal gets dirty and dusty fast, I am here looking for a replacement. I have had mine for 5 years, so it is resilant."
5,This book is a must read for all Garth fans!,"This book grabbed my attention and held on from beginning to end every time I read it! This isn't your run-of-the-mill, facts-everybody-already- knows kind of books. Matt O'Meilia does an outstanding job of describing the trials, troubles, and times of a young, struggling Garth Brooks just as he and their former band-mates remember them from their lives back in Eastern Oklahoma. Weather you think you know everything about Mr. Brooks or if you know absolutly nothing about this legend, this book is sure to leave you with a smile and many interesting stories you will not find anywhere else. You may also find yourself with a new sense of hope and determination for your own goals as O'Meilia shows the hopes and dreams of five young men, one in particular, come alive."
4,workable good tour book,This was a very informative book. Though it did not give the info I needed for hotels otherwise a helpful book.
2,Are they really Taiyo Yuden ???,I know that Taiyo Yuden manufactures quality professional blank media but these are from from it. There is no proof on the CD hub that identifies them as Taiyo Yuden. Already I have had 2 out of 10 CDs that did'nt record any data during a live church service although the Tascam pro unit we use showed that recording was in process. Buyers beware!
4,Microwaves best?...............,"As far as microwave popcorn is concerned, it's at least at or very near the top. It would be nice if it had more butter!! And it will never be as good as DIY old-fashioned stove top popped!! But, I'd still buy it again!"
1,Where's the power cord?,"I sure would like to be using my new HP ZB3000 expansion base. Unfortunately, there was no AC adapter in the box."
4,Mark VII Viper,"One of the only items you can get representing this BSG fighter. Quality is not bad as well, considering it's scale."
3,Loving Jack,Lovely novel. You couldn't help falling in love with Jack and wondering why it took our steamy architect so long!
5,Fascinating dark fantasy,"I'm glad to see that someone has finally picked up the gauntlet thrown down by Robert Holdstock in Mythago Wood. Tom Piccirilli manages to weave a fascinating spell of ghosts, guilt, humanoid woodling creatures, and dark magic upon a highly stylized, literary landscape. Like Holdstock, Piccirilli writes about human fears and foibles no matter how inhuman the fantastical characters might be. Ghosts are troubles, angry, loving, gentle, etc., and play off well with the minimal cast to show just how much the past is a part of the living and the dead. A tour de force of fantasy. Highly recommended."
2,Ugh - I dragged this piece of crap 500 miles to the beach,Avoid this book! I don't think the book is 'deep' as other reviewers have stated; it's just a confusing mess of uninteresting characters. The main character is dull - and his dead family who keep showing up are barely more interesting. The agent character has no reason to exist and the two female characters (living) seem to be tacked on. And what's with the muses in the woods? I give it two stars instead of one because it was cheap and the print was LARGE. I was praying for the end of this one.
5,A great read,"This is one of the most shocking and bizarre books I've ever read. Shocking not only in the horrific sense, but also in the fact that Mr. Piccirilli writes with an originality rarely seen before. The ""horror aspects"" of the novel are only one particular level to a much larger story that's filled with threads concerning the destruction of the family, fear of death, the act of creating something of artistic value, and a belief system that's more complex than all the canons of Catholocism. Mr. Piccirilli has delivered an outrageous story that far surpasses common horror fiction, and I praise him for his efforts. Everybody not looking for the same old thing ought to give this one a shot."
5,RMD,"This coverlet is great. Good quality, nice color. I bought this for our second home and wish that it would be available again for our main residence."
2,Avate Wash Cloth,"I am comparing this cloth with one I've recently used. I had previously purchased this type of Avate wash cloth from Athena's Products. It lasted well over a year for me and stretched out when it was wet, shrunk when it was dry. The Avate wash cloth I recently purchased here is ok. It shrunk when wet and the ends roll, which sometimes makes it hard to hold onto while washing. It still feels good in that it feels like it exfoliates as described, but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. It was the opposite of the one I was used to, shrinking when wet and curling. But then again, I also paid about 1/2 the price for it, so I can't really complain. The old saying goes 'you get what you pay for' so next time, I will spend the extra few $$ for a better product."
2,Great cast-poor movie,Very poor script with a great cast--I love Jeff Goldblum and Alicia Silverstone but what are they doing in such a stupid movie? The effects are so fake that it is insulting--the storyline starts out good but becomes very stupid as the movie goes on. Jeff plays a father with a head trip-he died and came back-saw his deceased daughter on the way. Jeff is very good in these roles but this is a little far fetched. The serial killer part is cool but the connection is a little off. The ending is very predictable and you wonder why you watched the movie in the first place. Avoid this one Jeff Goldblum fans!!!
1,complete crap,"hmm... this may have been the worst martial arts movie ive ever seen..lol, they use a gamecube, christmas tree lights and a bike helmet for there cool ""virtual reality system"".. fight scenes are very pathetic, If your interested in a real martial artist, watch some of tony jaa's stuff, hes good, maybe even close to Bruce lee's level."
5,Not Just For Kids!,"I haven't used crayons in at least 20 years, being an adult and supposedly past all that kid stuff. I don't know what made me do it, but on a whim I bought this box of 120 crayons, as well as a mandala coloring book, and I've been having a blast. Just reading the names of all those colors is fun, and the coloring itself is so relaxing after a long day at work. I put on some music, lay on the floor with all those crayons spread out around me, and I just lose myself in play for an hour. It's great."
3,don't go this way if you want to save $,"too costly...i was able to buy just about as many crayons in several separate boxes at local Walmart for 1/4 the price, i'm sad to say, so while this may be a convenient way to purchase a box of crayons not the most cost efficient!"
2,I did not like this much!,"I have read many Autism books and I am always looking to find out more info about this. I picked this book up at the library and I mainly skimmed the book. It was very boring. Chapter 11 Learning and forgetting at school was the only chapter in the whole book that was informative. It explained my son to a tee. The school system does not understand children with autism . They don't understand they learn different, Their behavior is not always them acting defiant. There are many other books on this subject that are much better such as Autism for dummies.."
4,Love and Humanity,"Chuck Snowden has done an excellent job of relating his own life experiences to the central theme of this book: that all men (well most) are inherently good. Snowden, who came from a fatherless boyhood, grew up under the direction of many teachers and coaches, most of whom were white, and all of whom treated him fairly. Indeed, some were highly inspirational, namely his high school football coach Roy Lester. From the perspective of a African American, Snowden provides many insights about several different historical figures that may have gone unnoticed to those of us who are not black or otherwise sensitive to race relations and inclusiveness.All in all, a very good book to read to better understand and appreciate love and humanity, attributes which most people have and practice in their daily lives regardless of who they are dealing with."
5,"BLATANTLY HONEST, SERIOUSLY DIRECT","Chuck has captured the imagination and practicality of history and historic figures unlike anyone has ever done before. Be prepared to laugh out loud, shed a tear and be taught something you may have not known. It provides a different dose of reality that many people need, especially during this current period of greed and selfishness in the USA."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this because it was a huge 10 pounder. I did my research but i missed the serving size. 4 huge (i think they use the word ""heaping"") scoops. thats a lot of scoops and makes the servings per container really low for the tub they sent me. Next time i will find a smaller package with one scoop serving size. Tastes great though."
3,Not as funny as expected,"I'm not done watching this season yet but so far I must admit I haven't found the episods as the former ones... But I keep holding my breathe until I finally discover who gets to be Ted's spouse ! ;-) (PS : Sorry if my english ain't perfect, I'm from France)"
3,WARNING! Might have major binding error.,"The 2002 McBooks Press version (paperbook) that I bought at Borders has pages 145 through 192 printed twice, and then pages 198 to 241 are missing altogether! I can't imagine how such a mistake could get by. One minute they are setting up in the trenches, the next they are sailing wearily out of the the bay. So...I have no idea what happened and I'm taking it back tomorrow for a refund.So check it out before you buy it.Otherwise, great book."
2,A waste of money,I have two cats. The two year old male is terrified of these balls and will run if anyone rolls in one in his direction. The 9 month old female ignores them. My children use them for tossing into containers for ball toss games otherwise I would have given it one star instead of two.
5,3 Awesome Movies brought to HD,"3 Awesome movies brought to hd all we need now is a Mallrats,Dogma,Clerks 2 BluRay combo pack!!!! Highly recommended to all you ViewAskew Universe fanatics .The actors are awesome and the movies a great time !!"
1,THIS IS UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCT! DON'T BUY IT!,"This DVD is unauthorized product; not an ""official"" mariah carey video. Music Box is licensed to Columbia Records/Sony Music, but this DVD is being released by a random 3rd party. This explains why there are no videos from the album.Also notice the cover photography looks nothing like her font/style. Do not order this, its a waste of money...just interviews with some critics and a verbal chronicle of the album's chart history."
1,Don't waste your money,It looks like amatures put this together. The quality is very poor. I know it says An unauthorized documentary film on it but most of the time they are usually at least good. This one is very very very bad. I'm a big Mariah Carey fan and I couldn't watch more than a few mintues of this documentary.
3,Smif-N-Wessun is BACK!!!!!,"It may be true, but the proof inn't in the pudding. Honestly, the stand out cuts were all featured on their mix-tape ""Still Shinin"" and were all taken from their shelved Rawkus LP.This album was a good effort, but could have been WAY better. Look at ""Monkey Bars"" and ""Chemistry,"" these two LPs blew me away after years of doubt from the BCC. The ""Reloaded"" LP and the 3rd instalment of the triple threat releases left me thinking the same things I did when the BCC fell off.Please don't read this the wrong way; because I am very excited with the new and improved BCC and look forward toward their next releases. I'm just dissapointed with this latest instalment from Smif-N-Wessun."
1,GIVES DOGS SEIZURES!! DONT FEED,This treat has given my 120 pound doberman seizures and diarrhea badly. He is shaking all over and can barely walk as his hind legs are not wanting to stand. The muscles keep contracting. He finally vomited a lot of the bone.I fed him one small busy bone. How can a company allow this to be sold?????????????The chemicals and colors in this treat are off the chart. PLEASE DO NOT FEED THIS TO YOUR DOG. I HAVE REPORTED IT TO PURINA AND THE FDA
5,A very underrated gem,"I think this album has been unfairly maligned both by fans and the artist himself over the years. Sure, there are a few stabs at pop here, and the back up band seems a bit ""canned"" (pun intended) at times, but overall the songwriting is excellent and the performances are top-notch. ""Big Fat Zero"", ""Another Grey Area"" and ""You Hit The Spot"" are classic GP, and ""Temporary Beauty"", ""Crying For Attention"", and ""Fear Not"" are loaded with hooks. I wouldn't say this is Graham's best album, or even that someone who is new to GP should buy this one first, but its definately worth buying and is better than just about anything that was released by other artists at the time......"
4,Good Book,"I bought this book for a Christmas gift, and it was well-received and well-read during the holidays."
2,Nothing New,"I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this book is getting such rave reviews. I found it to be a major disappointment, mostly because the reviews led me to expect much more. This book is for the TOTALLY clueless, ie., those who don't know that rosemary goes with lamb and chicken, apples with pork, beans with bacon, etc. I can see how it could help jumpstart a kitchen novice, but if a professional chef needs this book he/she is in the wrong profession. There's absolutely nothing new here. To make matters worse, it's in boring black and white with not one image (color or otherwise) to inspire or break the monotony. I've tried again and again to find a reason to keep this book but can't come up with one. It's up for sale. Sorry folks, I just can't agree on this one."
5,Excellent reference for culinary students,"I used this book as a reference for my hot foods classes in culinary school. It is well written and gives you many, many hints on how fully cultivate your talents in the kitchen. This book is a must buy for any culinary student. I also used the following for my baking classes in culinary school:Study Guide for Baking: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Melissa HeilmanStudy Guide for Advanced Baking: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Melissa HeilmanThese last two books helped me to prepare for the types of questions seen on my baking and advanced baking classes. With the help of these two books, I got a 94 average. Some of my friends in other culinary schools told me about these last two books and how it helped them to reduce their study time and get excellent grades. The first book Culinary Artistry is an awesome book no culinary student should be without. I recommend these 3 books as must buys."
5,Very Sporty,"If you like a modern twist to 60's rock, then this is the album for you. Huey Lewis has a great oice, and every single song on this soundtrack is good. You can't miss with this CD if you like 80's Top 40."
4,Hey remember that guy from Fame?,"It's at least worth seeing. Tawney Kitaen and the guy from Fame. Story line is a little ""out there"" but when Rock n Roll binds love you get the best of both worlds,"
5,Panasonic Irrigator,"I am delighted that the Panasonic ""water pick"" is small and portable. It is convenient, nicely shaped, efficient and very easy to use with the nozzle being stored in the unit itself. It is very efficient in removing food from the most difficult places. I am well pleased with all of my purchases using Amazon.com."
3,Sharon Tate wasn't just a pretty face.,"This is the first book on the murders that I have read that really let you know the real Sharon Tate. She seemed to be a sweet, caring person and it is really a shame that with her beauty and charm that she didn't have more self confidence in herself. Maybe if she did, she would still be alive today. By that I mean she may have chosen a different path to follow, one that wouldn't have crossed the path of a sick group of people who had no regard for human life. The book was well written, the pictures weren't that great, but there were a few things in the book that I had never known about before. It is worth the time it takes to read it, and for me that was just one afternoon. I hope the killers, any of them, never see the other side of the chain link fences that separate them from the other innocent people they may come in contact with. Reformed? I don't think so."
3,"No new insight, but still a good book","I read Helter Skelter and that for me will always be one of the scariest true crime books ever written. So when I heard about this book I decided to read it. I have seen in the past, Sharon Tate's mother and sister help keep the animals that killed the lovely actress, her friends, and the LaBianca's behind bars. The book makes you even sadder for these victims because it shows the really human side of Ms. Tate not just the glamourous side you've read about. The creepiest part of the book, that will send chills up your spine was - four months before the murders, a strange looking character walked up to the house looking for someone, Ms. Tate and her friend asked the creepy little fellow what he wanted. That creepy little man was Charles Manson."
3,Entertaining ReHash,"You've got to give King credit for taking the focus off manson & co and giving Tate and friends the attention they finally deserve. King's patient and sensitive recreation of the days leading up the murders is clearly the highlight here; the small ordinary details of Tate's last days giving the reader a sense of impending dread.The problem with this book though is that it feels like a patchwork. Its as though King just pasted together this book from the same sources that I and many others have read. There are some new bits of info for sure (Michelle Phillips has some interesting observations) but there is not enough for it to be considered groundbreaking or illuminating. An entertaining read, but doesn't have nearly the impact of Helter Skelter."
3,Does not fit Slik Sprint Pro EZ Tripod,"I couldn't find anything that explicitly mentioned my tripod model, but this one looked like the right one... and I keyed in on ""EZ"". Unfortunately, B0000BZYS8 does not fit my tripod. I've ordered the DQ-20--hopefully, it will fit.I first searched Slik's website, hoping it would list accessories and product identifiers for particular tripods. If the information is there, it eluded me.)My three stars are middling because I think the description should do a better job of indicating which shoes fit which tripods."
5,One of his very best. And still powerful,"The boy is becoming a man. Punk energy, anger still generate anthems, but urgency eases out steadiness; toughness increases, but so does uncertainty; demands increase as hope falters. Bitterness peeks through for first time, but GP's giant heart continues to pour over everything. Quintessential GP + Rumour. Tough, tight, soulful, passionate anthems. Towers over anything being made today. Almost all tracks are classics. Stand-out: tr 10--(Can't have) Love without greed."
3,Napalm Death - 'Fear Emptiness Despair' (Earache),"'Fear...' is their fifth album.As Napalm Death has never exactly been one of my favorite thrash bands,I can't deny they've held their fan's interest all these years in keeping true to their roots.Which is,playing ear-splitting reckless grindcore.I've seen them play live,twice now.The second time was recent as they were support band for Cannibal Corpse.More people seemed to have been there for Napalm than Cannibal.Go figure.As for the tunes,I thought ""Twist The Knife Slowly"",""Hung"",""Armageddon x 7"" and maybe ""Primed Time"" were so-so.Should appeal to the same crowd that supports bands like Cannibal Corpse,Death,Entombed,Carcass and Sepultura.Mosh and enjoy."
3,Not what I had hoped,"A very complete book for the muzzle loader, but not much data for the black cartridge shooter. It should be up-dated to reflect the other types of black powder substitutes available today as well as Pyrodex."
4,(+),"It is evident with this particular book, that long and hard hours were spent to detail a topic that few really believe is true. The author works to bring fact (old rail lines, old rail towns) and fiction (headless lampmen, ghost passengers) together into a form of entertainment suitable for reading. Any person who spent even the slightest time as a child walking along a rail line, or as a ticket holding guest will enjoy the mixture of realism and folklore. If you don't care too much for the ghost part of it, fine ... the historical documentation is rich. And if you want to hear about campfire 'lore, Mr. Reevy supplies not only the stories, but sometimes the people who tell them."
3,good story spoiled by too many flashbacks,"J. A. Jance pays homage to Native American culture in this thriller set in the Arizona desert. Each chapter starts with an excerpt from Indian folklore, which ties together the character development and the story. I found the excessive number of flashbacks easy to follow, but annoying. This book is not up to the standard of the Joanna Brady series."
2,Carcass on valium,"After Necroticism, Carcass just lost it. This is a pale shadow of what Carcass was. No Deep Vocals !!!! Without the dual vocal attack, their music just doesnt have the same effect.I would only recommend this to the die hard Carcass fan who needs every album they released.Symphonies of Sickness destroys this CD."
3,fiesta trivet,Quality is consistent with fiesta ware products. disappointent with size and stabilty. can only use for decorative purposes only not functionable.
3,Great Pictures but little information,"This is an outstanding book if you are looking for pictures of vintage volkswagens but don't look for much more than that. Although the pictures are great there is no indication of what you are looking at unless you jump back and forth from the ""Description"" section in the rear of the book. Lastly you will not get every year of the vintage volkswagens so don't look for anything beyond 1961, and some of the years prior to '61 are missing as well. If you are just looking for some great pictures prior to '61 this book is for you. If you are looking for something more substantial such as changes from model year to model year, and a larger range of years, then keep looking."
2,Average book with not much information,"This book does have some very nice photographs of Beetles in their original form; however, it contains no written information and the photos are not even marked. The only way to tell what you are looking at is to check with a legend at the back of the book.I'm sure that any true vintage nut would not have to check with this legend to confirm the model they are looking at and I thought the way this book was designed was very poor.Nice pics with not much else. Average book in my opinion.There are certainly other VW books out there that are much better than this one!"
5,Brilliant rock personality/brillaint rock album,"Little Steven, or ""Miami"" Steve Van Zant, or whatever you wanna call him, is the coolest man of the millenium. This clever, intense album truly rocks, while never insulting you with boring, tired lyrics. Every influence is worn like a badge of honor, and never rehashed or trite. Little Steven, quite frankly, should be bigger than he is, but it's nice to have him around anyway. Little's only a nickname. Steve's the biggest guy in the world."
5,Second lens for my Canon Digital Rebel XT,"I am not a professional photographer, but I had a need to shoot some close ups for my daughters basketball games. I've not had a chance to use it for this yet, but I took it to a Cubs/Brewers game, and sitting in the stands, I got some amazing shots of the hitters, pitchers, etc. I could stop a 100MPH fastball on the way to the plate, the clarity was amazing.The lens is quite large, so I need a new camera bag, but I am very pleased with the quality, and how easily it snaps onto my existing camera."
2,Not as expected,"I was very excited to receive this lens after reading the reviews here at Amazon. However, my disappointment was big as I didn't notice better image quality compared to my beloved Canon 28-135 lens. Also, the 200mm zoom is barely better than the 135 zoom. And I'm not able to shoot any people that are standing close to me. This requires a constant change of lenses, which is a real hassle. For this price this lens doesn't deliver much satisfaction. The 28-135 lens is way better, comes with an Image Stabilizer, awesome sharp pictures and is much shorter, therefore easier to carry around. I'll return the L lens...."
5,Don't need is,If your shooting outside in daylight you dont need IS. This lens is sharp and at ISO 400 with my 40D hand held with shutter at 1/160 I've gotten sharp and true color images. This Lens is really not as heavy as I thought it would be Long yes but not heavy.
4,Almost Perfect,"So I'm starting to get more serious about my photography. I went out and bought this as my entry to the ""L"" class of lenses. I mounted it on my 40D at home and I didn't really see what the big deal was. It wasn't until we went out for an Engagement shoot that I found the magic of this lens. The Bokeh was wonderful for my portrait shots. Absolutely wonderful. Very crisp pictures.Almost perfect because of the f4 - it didn't do so well in the shade. But, I can't really complain since the 2.8 is almost twice as much and the 2.8L IS which is almost unreachable for the amateur. But one day it will be mine, oh yes, it will be mine.I don't mind the white paint either, makes it look ""professional"". We were out on location and as soon as we took it out bystanders got out of the way of our shoot.So in summation, it's a great price to try out the ""L"" lenses. This and the 17-40L. But remember that it's an f4 and that it's white if that makes a big deal to you."
4,Worth the price,"I hummed and hawwed for quite a while before buying this. My 75-300mm f4-5.6 was was too soft at 200+ and using a CP was nearly impossible. Would this lens be worth all the extra though?I think it is, my photo's haven't magically leaped forward overnight but out of the 500 photos i took over the past 2 weeks (the majority with this lens) I'm happy with most of them something which never would have happened before. Those i'm not are mainly due to fast moving birds.The build quality is very good as you'd expect. The constant f4 and internal focusing almost justifying the lens on their own in my opinion. I've also obtained much sharper images then i would have before, even <1/200 at full zoom.I'm really glad i bought this, and am not even missing the IS at present."
1,Trash,"Simply put, Psuedo-Historical nonsense that was written by a hack LINGUIST. Honestly I really dont know how any SANE individual could stomach the opening. One good thing about it though is that it sure warms you up on a cold night and did provide surprising illiumanation so I could read something worthwhile."
1,Not worth much!,This product was not worth the money I spent. The figures legs don't bend and he looks cheap.This product is just cheesy looking.
4,Chandelier Cleaner a fair go,"My husband purchased this spray for our chandelier that hadn't been cleaned in years! We felt that it did a decent job. We will probably hand wash the exterior crystals on the chandelier as they still seem a bit spotty, but the interior is fine, and no one sees that too closely anyways."
1,This product is not genuine,"This product is not genuine, not original, not the original smell. Please return the money.I buy one at CVS and is really different.Please return the money. asp"
4,criminally underrated lost death metal classic,these guys are from the death metal capital of florida and two of these members are from the ledgendary band death.this cd seams to have gotten lost in the basement of earache records during the lose of interest in metal of the 90 but a solid cd release.
4,Lovely art!,"This unabriged editon of the 100 year old story is WONDERFUL. Denslow's art was made for the story---you can't seperate 'em, but this artist did and rather critizing it like the other artist's picutres, I really enjoyed it! Charles illustrates like you are really there. HIGHLY recommended."
1,*** Defective motor ***,"The [American DJ M-HDAC8 Three RPM Mirror Ball Motor] that I received was defective. I opened the package and plugged it in immediately, with no objects attached to it. I could tell the motor was running, but the stem that holds the disco ball did not turn at all. It seemed like it might not be properly attached to the motor.I would never buy this item if I were you. Additionally, this item was labelled as ""Made in China"".Amazon allowed me to return the item as defective, at no charge to me via UPS. Amazon provided the return label online for me to print out. I did return the item in its original packaging exactly as I received it.I plan to try a different manufacturer."

3,"Great show, but the video/color quality is lousy and changes from one episode to another.","I wish they had remastered the originals before putting them out. I like the series, but it's hard to even figure out what color Hazel's hair is because it changes constantly in each show."
4,Great Battery,"This is the ideal battery: lightweight, and compact. It charges quickly and is easy to pop in and out of the Minolta X50 or X60. It has a long battery life, but I recommend buying a second battery for the camera just in case you are caught with a great photo opt and no battery."
4,Futile sacrifice!,"Werner Girbig shows us how the sheer overwhelming numeric superiority of the allies led to the tragic deaths of many young German fighter pilots in useless acts of bravery and courage. It's a good book, although sometimes it seems to have been written in a hurry and leave some conclusions to the reader find what hapenned!"
3,Solid starting machine... just add RAM!,"This is a solid starter computer.Note the two different cosmetic faces this computer can have.All you need to do is add ram. I added a 512mb PC2100 chip ($99 05/04) to this machine and it flies. I can play Madden 2004 just fine. Regularly, I will have opera full of windows, adobe photoshop, macromedia dreamweaver, winamp, seti@home, antivirus, two messenger programs running... and the computer is well under control. I can flip back and forth to windows with ease without any problems. If you want to play the latest games, then ofcourse, you're to need a better machine with a dedicated video card, but otherwise this is a great machine for 95% of tasks. The case has a small footprint, which I like. Note that I didn't use the modem, but the onboard network card is fine and I threw a second hard drive in with ease.The front USB ports are handy."
2,Don't bother wasting your money.,"$800.00 for a little computer? That's crazy! Especially when you can buy a lowend laptop for about the same price and have alot more functionality. Forget the small size. The Small size can't compensate for the lack of compatibility with all Microsoft Office Products. This product is over-priced, incompatible, and a big waste of time. Grab a Palm Pilot for 1/3 the price of this and you get the same functionality as this product and less headache. By the way, if you want color, wait for the Palm IIIc due out later this month."
4,A little far fetched but,A good story with a lot of loop holes in it but it will keep your attention for the entire movie.
1,Take It Out With The Trash,"Like Jason, we gave this one 45 minutes then couldn't take it any more. The plot is full of holes and the lame dialogue isn't helped by terrible acting. I would much rather sit alone in a room with the lights out than have to watch one more second of this fourth rate mess. Leonard Pinth Garnell would have loved this one--""Dreadful!! Simply awful!!"""
4,Simply well done,"I don't wan't to spoil anythng by reveling the plot, but wanted to give my thoughts about this movie. I saw this movie while staying at a hotel. I truly enjoyed it. The actors had great chemistry & didn't overact the scenes. The movie moves smoothly (almost slow), but keeps you locked into the story. The scenery in the movie is beautiful. I would love to see these actors together in another movie."
4,Good story. Has potential,"This was written, and directed by the male lead character. The romantic female lead is his wife, and it kind of feels like it. I kept thinking it was a great story but it could have really been better directed. The premise is good (I won't go through that here, you've probably already read it in the description if you are interested to read people's reviews), the acting is good, and--for a lower budget film--the production is quite good. It just seems to fall flat in areas you would expect to fall on the shoulders of the director. For example some scenes tend to slow the momentum and other scenes might as well have been shortened, or deleted altogether. Overall it wasn't a bad movie at all. I liked it, and thought it was better than a ""just okay"" three-star rating. If you like romantic comedy/dramas you probably won't be disappointed. They aren't my favorite. However, my wife--a big fan--did liked it."
4,Different and I Like That,So I'm reviewing this months after viewing it and honestly can't remember the plot. I only recall the feeling it left me with -- satisfied to have seen something different enough to be refreshing.
5,A movie that I hope people find -- great fun,Take me home was a movie that I only happened to find by chance -- it stars and is written/directed/produced by Parenthood star Sam Jaegar and this is just a fun ride. They actually took a cab across country. It's better than most romantic dramas and Sam Jaegar is just terrific. Well written and a must see.
5,Excellent Discs!,"Our family uses these Fuji DVD-RW discs for ""daily"" TV recording (time-shifting), and we're completely satisfied with them.We bought our first five-pack of Fuji discs when we purchased our first DVD recorder, using them as you might use VHS tapes to record various network TV shows and watch them at our convenience.Fuji Film stands behind their product's warranty 100%, no questions asked. They replaced two discs that were damaged by being in close proximity to the heat generated by a satellite receiver, something which was really our fault and not theirs. (We had placed the receiver underneath the DVD recorder, and the heat rising from the receiver was doing really screwy things to the discs as they were being recorded.)Providing that you don't expose these discs to too much heat, they work perfectly. We are very pleased with their performance and have purchased a second five-pack.Bottom line: Recommended without hesitation."
4,Great Start,This was a helpful book for a beginner. I learned enough to want to tackle a test project.
2,Strange and Wonderful,"Damn! as a Civil Engineer I've worked with concrete as a structural material for the last ten years, now I'm building jy own kitchen and thought I had an original idea. The book is not bad on ideas but poor in specifications and technical details. Moreover, the authors don't seem to know much about things like the effect of vibrating the poured mix, the qualities of different type of concrete, different aggregate and, last but not least, admixtures."
1,Mother bird is a bad role model for adoptive families,"I simply don't understand why this book gets such great reviews. The artwork is good, but the ""role model"" that the mother bird represents is awful.She tells the baby bat that if she doesn't act like everyone else in her family, she can't live with them anymore. What a horrible thing to say to an adopted child! The mother bird gets credit for nourishing the baby bat, but nearly destroys the bat's identity in the process.The other baby birds are accepting of Stellaluna, so they also earn points, and I suppose the story has a happy ending in that Stellaluna and mother bat are reunited in the end, but being an adoptive parent, I have to take strong issue with the message presented by the mother bird.If you are an adoptive parent, beware of this book and its message."
5,School Book Review,"Did you ever live with birds? I read a book about a bat that did. It was called Stellaluna by Janell Cannon. This book is about how a bat named Stellaluna gets separated from her mother. Stellaluna has to live with birds. She tried to teach the baby birds how to fly. Eventually they learned from their mother. I like this book because it was funny when Stellaluna and the birds were hanging upside down from their nest. I also like this book because it has adventure. I think the author's message was that you should have hope that everything will turn out fine in the end, meaning Stellaluna will find her mother. You should read this book to find out if Stellaluna will ever see her mother and home again."
3,Too sad,"While I was able to appreciate the story and the art, the theme was a little upsetting for my sensitve child. She just felt so sad that Stellaluna was separated from her Mom. I don't think that's the best place to start a childrens' story."
2,OUCH........... BAD EFFORT FROM CARCASS,"Carcass is such an amazing band but for some reason, they all of a sudden just didn't do to well in this album. the only good song from this album is corporal jigsore quandary so I suggest you should just burn that song in a cd. if you expect good stuff from carcass then buy Heartwork or wake up and smell the carcass. this album is awfully boring."
4,The only place were smelling like putrid flesh is good,"While this is not in my opinion their finest moment, ""necroticism"" is a truly great death\grind album. The guitars cut like chainsaws, the drums hammer down our brain like err... a hammer, and Billy growls like he's the autopsy victim. In their own words: ""...delicious...""."
4,Keen Newport Sandal,"They may not be the most elegant shoe on the rack but they are so comfortable, practical and I love them. Great for hiking as your toe is protected yet there is plenty of airflow to prevent your feet sweating. They are washable and very quick to dry, I have very flat feet and wear orthotics in other shoes, but these sandals are so supportive I don't need orthotics. Great quality they are made to last."
5,An Exorcist Tells His Story,A unique and critically important book for Catholic bishops and priests who are the ordinary ministers of persons under diabolical influence.
5,Great Buy!,I bought this book based on the reviews it recieved and it was the right choice! Awesome book!
3,pretty informative,i got this book hopin to hear some good stories about demons runnin' around possessin' people and other cool stuff like that but it was mostly preachy stuff and info about churches stance on exorcism. i wish there was a cop or something in the book that would challenge the demon to a fist fight. that would have made this a 5 star book.
4,Joe's Book Review,Book was well written and shed a lot of light on how the church (Catholic) views exorcisms. It really was more of an apeal by the author to the church to take possession seriously. I liked the book.
4,Sorry to see it end,"Great show that lost it's way for a stretch in season 3 and then more or less returned to form. It seems like they resorted to a bit too much raunchy humor in these last two seasons but the heart of the show was still there.I'd like to see an hour reunion show where they wrap things up. Also, there wasn't enough Pigsquatch."
5,Great Earl!,"The Final Season! ...sigh... One of the most-consistently-funny shows on TV. Darnell revealed! Imprisoned by Patty's mom! Who's yer daddy?! Chaz Dalton's Space Academy! All this, and more! Deleted scenes, bloopers, Earl's Fan Mail extras are hilarious. It comes in a nice, sturdy box with a picture of underpants on a clothesline. Subtitulados en espaÃ±ol por los amigos de Garcia!"
5,Best One Yet,"I really hated to see this very funny series go !! I think season four was one of the best ones out there !! Season 1 was a great starter, but the prison and coma segments in season 2 and 3 were not super entertaining. Season 4 went back to the roots of 1, but much more refined. You can finally find out why Crabman went into witness protection !! None of the folks I work with enjoyed the show, so I had no one to talk to about the shows. I just enjoyed them myself."
4,Nice authentic Prada bag...,"Fast shipping and arrived with authenticity card and dust bag. It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be but I'm very happy with it. I thought I had ordered the Rosso color but I mistakenly ordered the Lillia. I was going to return it but I actually ended up liking the color (it's lighter than it looks in the picture.) I was able to fit a paperback book, a can of hairspray, my small make-up bag, my keys, my cell and a few other odds and ends."
2,Expected more from Prada,"I ordered this bag and was thrilled with the fast delivery and overall appearence of the bag. After a few weeks the bag began to unravel at the seams, and I am very disappointed with the quality, and expected more from Prada. Also there was no dust bag included."
3,Little bit oild one,It is a little bit old one. The quality of video looks old one. This video is not a region free format. However this video does not said about the region.
3,Rudimentary Read,"This book highlights some very inspirational and relevant stories, however it is lacking in theoretical underpinnings. Some it felt like rhetoric. Leadership is such a complex domain that it really requires much more than these anecdotal recollections to gain traction in the field."
4,Where has this been hiding?,"I've researched Jackson and peers for over 30 years and I'm just now finding this book? It's disorganized, makes preposterous claims, but is chock full of things you won't find anywhere else. Agrarian, politician, and statesman from Georgia, Watson did personal research on this back in 1912; though somewhat regarded badly for his sectarian views on civil rights he was in his time well-respected and compared to William Jennings Bryan by some. There are stories here that a couple of them will make you cringe, so be able to handle the different times or don't do it. I don't know how much is true nor do I care, it is simply another man's opinion of history and I like it."
1,NO SERVICE/NO SMILE,"I purchased a 15 GB ipod for a bday gift for my husband in August. He didn't want it so instead of returning it we put in the safe until Xmas to give to our son at that time. Unfortunately, you only have 90 days for free technical support. We didn't even turn it on until after Xmas and 3 1/2 months had passed. We had problems immediately. I called tech support. No help there. They want to sign you up for a service contract for 59.00. They won't answer the most basic of questions. I asked for an address to send it to. This guy told me to look online and it would cost another 35.00 to mail it back. When spending 400.00 plus converter etc, I thought they would be more helpful.It is extra for everything on an already expensive toy. I found the customer service to be rude and not helpful at all. This was an expensive mistake. Buy another brand."
1,Ipod Stinks,"Got one for Christmas. Tried for a week to get the software installed and configured correctly. After many reconfigures and downloading of updates, the best the Ipod would do was skip like a three legged dog. Went online to Apple and found others with similar problems. Called Apple customer service and afer being on hold for 45 mins, the call was droped by Apple's answering service. After that the Ipod was on it's way back to the store and good ridance."
5,Best there is.,"I can't say enough good things about my iPod. I use my 40gb iPod to store my music collection and as a external HD for my powerbook. This slick setup is more than functional. If you dont want to use the extra space as an external HD you can probably save the money and and get a smaller iPod.Functionally, the iPod is easy to use right out of the box. You wont find anything easier. Add ons finish the case for buying an iPod: Numerous third party products make this the player you have to have. Check out the custom FM players available for an iPod --no dongles anymore! consider the iTunes Music store, 99 cent songs and its legal. Numerous options for cases, boom boxes, home audio, remote controllers, the list goes on.One last thing about using the extra space for a HD. It is easy to setup this extra space as a backup drive to copy critical information and documents."
3,See the light?,"The iPod is well designed and very well made and this is where the good stuff about it ends. I find it one of the most anti-intuitive devices I have ever used, with software that must have been engineered by only the most crass of merchants. Flexibility is not the ipod, and it is unlike the Mac in every way. Its clear after having used one for a few years that Fashion over Function is the secret to its success.The question is, who will I sell mine to?"
5,An excellent overview of this subject.,"I first purchased this book when it was first published, and to give you an idea how much I enjoyed it I also purchased the new edition. While I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Kenny's review it should be noted that to the small royal citadel of only 5 or so acres described in the first editon there should be added a lower fortified town encompassing a further 45 acres. These new finds, showing Troy to be significantly larger in scale than even Mycenae and thus a major Anatolian citadel even more in keeping with Homer's descriptions are addressed in the new edition."
2,"One Ok Movie, One Crazy Movie.","The movie came with two movies, the one with Michael Ontkean in it is good.but the other movie was terrible, and it dosn't even have Michael Ontkean it."
3,Heavy but not that heavy...,"Although I'm personally a huge fan of Entombed, I would rate this album the same as the chronology of its release, third amongst their full length releases. Unlike others, it would seem that Entombed's aggressiveness and their ability to captivate the listener has decreased with every album, starting with the classic Left Hand Path. Having said that, Wolverine Blues is still and exceptional album compared to most other bands releases of the same year. It still posesses a raw heaviness, and at parts displays the boys' exceptional musicianship. Songs like Demon, Heavens Die, Wolverine Blues, and Hollowman are all good, aggressive, catchy songs. If you like heavy groove metal, this is the album for you. If you're looking for something more earth shaking in originality and in brutality, then be sure to check out their previous two albums and hear the band that started the Swedish sound.dune666"
4,Helpful book.!,"Our grandson has cerebral palsy. Our daughter tells me that, despite all of the service providers he sees, she had not known how important it is to stretch him daily. Each of his service providers had thought that one of the others had mentioned that. She says that they (therapists, etc.) all think that this is one of the best c.p. how-to books around. Thank you."
3,Great recorder but don't lose your software CD!,"We've had this recorder for over a year now. It works great. I only have one complaint. We have recently moved houses and the software CD got lost in the move. I'm sure it's somewhere but you know how that is... I called tech support for Olympus to see about a replacement. I was told I could not download one but that I could purchase a replacement. They charge $50 for a replacement CD - FOR A PRODUCT I'VE ALREADY PURCHASED! This is ridiculous!So, word to the wise. Don't lose your CD or you'll be sorry!"
5,voicerecorder,"overall- I have not had any problem with this voice recorder. I think it's a great product. It's small, it's portable & the feature that I really like is that you can transfer your folders from your recorder to your PC"
1,I would not purchase anything from Cardella87,"This product did not come with instructions, it did not work from the start. After jiggling new batteries around, I got it to work for a little bit then it started beeping and shut down. Tried returning but was told to put new batteries in and sorry all sales are final."
1,Mind died after a few months,"I got one of these, used it about 3 dozen times over the course of a year, then it started acting strange.First, I couldn't delete files. Later, I just couldn't turn the power on. Its a dud now.This is my first time ever to write a negative review, and looking at all the positive reviews I feel I must have just had bad luck.Anyway, beware that it can just die on you with no understandable reason. Getting help from Olympus is just not that easy. Next time I'm going to get one from a store (like Sam's Club) that backs up the products they sell with their own warranty. Amazon is great but obviously can't help in this situation.My other experience with Olympus products (one other voice recorder and an underwater camera) has been positive. I've never had to communicate with them directly though, so now the bad feelings come out."
1,Not for dictation!!,"This unit apparently replaced the DS-330. The DS-330 allowed you to: record, pause, back-up, review what you just dictated and either 1) continue dictating from the end; 2) edit the middle; 3) insert a recording into the middle of a previously recorded clip.The DS-2 does NOT allow you to do that. In fact, everytime you stop, back up to review what you just dictated and start again, it creates a new file. My first letter had 60 voice recording files!!! This is not what you want if you are trying to get the benefits of digital dictation without losing the ease of tape. This might be great if all you intend to use it for is recording concerts or conferences. Otherwise, keep looking.I repeat this is not dictation equipment."
1,Poor product design,I bought this for dictation. The sound quality in SP is poor. I need the the DSS format for dictation so I can't use the higher quality formats.The recorder creates a new file each time you start recording so you can't start and stop in the middle of a dictation. This product is very user unfriendly.I returned this product and got a Phillips 9360 recorder for $260. The sound quality and design of this product is well worth paying over twice the price of the Olympus DS-2. I would not recommend this Olympus recorder for dictation use.
4,Very good after glitch fixed,"I used this recorder to record speakers in a large lecture hall. The first time I used it, a bug in the device caused it to have only 4 minutes of recording time instead of 4 hours! I changed the setting to 10 hours of recording time, and all it gave me was 10 minutes. Removing the batteries did not solve the problem. I finally had to go through the manual and learn how to erase all settings. This solved the problem, and ever since it has worked very well. I used it with an external mike."
2,No Rewind Feature,"This recorder does not allow the user to rewind, listen to recorded dictation and record over if a change is needed. We returned this item because it was not functional for long, complex dictations."
1,McDuff books,"I bought this book not knowing that it was the same as one I already had, with only the title changed. Big disappointment, but the book itself, in its previous incarnation, was lovely."
3,Hey,Would someone please write a reveiw on this camcorder. I would Love a camcorder and this is a great price but I know nothing about. How many pictures does it hold? How much camera space does it have? are the batteries rechargable?
1,Horrible Cam,"This product is horrible, I brought this cam thinking the digital pictures would be great, they were horrible, NO FLASH, not many functions of selecting picture quality such as contrast. The cam is horrible both inside and outside. I wanted to take pictures of items that I made, but I spent over 30 minutes to take one picture that was clear. You have to supply your own batteries vs other cams it comes with a battery that you can recharge, so that was another waste of money. I will never buy a cam from this company again."
1,Street Atlas USA 2008,"The product is confusing and hard to use. Very cluttered interface. While this was the 2008 version of the product, some major highway updates in Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 where not in this product. I thought this product was suppose to have new map updates? GPS interface also isn't very good compared to the GPS control panel in Sreets and Trips.One thing unique in this product is you can draw a new road on your maps. This is helpful if those highway updates never get made.I have used both this product and Streets and Trips. In my opinion, no comparison. Go with Streets and Trips."
2,Burning prisma,"A compilation of two EP releases, this 33-minute album is an item for completists. Originally issued in 1992, it features second guitarist Robert Hampson, who would also play on the subsequent album ""Pure"". ""S/CW"" rather leans towards the industrial sounds of ""Slavestate"", with dominating machine drums (similar to Front 242 or Nitzer Ebb). Unfortunately, the guitar work often sounds like a bunch of uninspired noise and the melodies are weak. The time between ""Streetcleaner"" and the third album ""Pure"" was something of a career low in GF's history. ""S/CW"" is edgy, noisy industrial rock, but taken as part of the largely brilliant GF oeuvre, this item is a disappointment."
4,Still holds up well over time deserved to be heard.,One of the more articulate writers of the 70's and 80's. I find the songs still hold up after all these years. Could never understand why he never achieved more recognition. Much better writer than a lot of junk that did get airplay. If you like Springsteen and/or Dylan you sholud like Elliot (or were these the comparisons that doomed him to relative obscurity).
4,Interesting Account of the Texas Plains of the 1870's,"Although lengthy, descriptive paragraphs describe setting and plot, I found this book interesting and informative concerning the fading out of the once powerful Comanche Indian nation in Texas during the l870's. I enjoyed the poetic prose thoughout his narrative.Evelyn Horan - authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"
4,A very good book for rogues,"I had been anticipating this book, and my antipation was due. This book does a much better job giving rogues things to do than ""Songs & Silence"". Concepts fill the bill for the novice rogue. The prestige classes are OK, but nothing to write home about. WHat is good about the book is tips on traps and on how to run a thieves' guild.If you are playing rogues, go get it."
2,TV Great VCR Not,"I purchased this tv/vcr combo in February and in June the VCR, during fast forward and rewind would stop, shut off the TV, and eject the tape. Took it in for repair and a microprocessor/voltage problem is too expensive to fix. So now I just have a TV with a VCR that can only PLAY. I would not recommend this set."
5,The greatest book I have ever read...period.,"Good Gravy!!! I read this book just after I had turned 17, andwas blown away by the outstanding skill Card uses to conveyhis characters' humanness - their trials, tribulations,victories and defeats. The book touched me, moved me in a waybooks don't normally do - I read it in one sitting, from 2til 5:30 in the morning - I just could NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!Read this book, you will _not_ regret it.BRAD ROHRER"
5,One of my favorite series of books,"I love the ender series. I read it when I was young and I really identified with ender. I have re-read the series a number of times and I love it more now than I did then, especially the first 6 books."
5,great read,"The moment I picked up this book I couldn't stop reading, this is by far one of the best books I've ever read."
1,KILL!...KILL!...KILL!,"This was like taking that one bad Harry Potter book and making it 100 times worse. Nothing but sadness, grief, depression, anguish and killing. Sounds like a kid's book? I personally think not."
5,ender's game,"I am a twelve year old and I am a sci-fi-/fantasy nut. Ender's game was handed to me by a forty-year-old freind of mine. Anything sci-fi is interesting to me, so i read it, and was hooked. Since then i have read it towo or three times and each time it is just as good. Orson Scott card it GREAT!!!!!!!!!! This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. Its just so incredibly overflowing with emotion and sensitivity that is impossible to explain. If i try to write down(or type in this case) all of it my mind just boggles. Wonderful read for philosopical Sci-fi fans over 20. This is a book that can be contemplated, discussed and read over and over. Good job mr. card Warning: Xenocide is the only decent sequel but won't make sense unless you read the other stinky ones."
2,Overrated,"Perhaps I've let my feelings about the author, who is a bigot, cloud my judgment, but though this novel has some good sections, it hardly deserves it's critical accolades and its sequels were unnecessary."
5,A classic read and gift,"Ender's Game was one of my favorite books when I first read it and I have enjoyed all of it's sequels, sisters books, etc.I actually purchased this copy for my new boyfriend - since he gave me one of his favs, I returned the favor. :)"
4,Interesting Read,Had several people tell me it was very interesting. They were correct. If you like sci-fi then you'll like this.
4,Great Book,"This is a very good book. I had read it once as a child, and decided to read it again. I read it in one day, so obviously I enjoyed it. I have two qualms with it, though. I think a more in-depth description of the buggers should have been supplied, as well as more history of the bugger wars. And i also felt that the end was fairly anti-climactic. Aside from that, it was a great book."
3,Sci-Fi Near Flop,"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a regular story that was packaged with a science fiction backdrop to make it more appealing. Ender's game does reflect problems in society by outlining the pressure that we put on the young to be number one. Ender's Game fails with grabbing the attention of an adult. The relationship between Ender and his sibling, Peter and Valentine, along with Enders internal stuggle to be the best or do what is right are the most important relationships and conflicts in the novel. Ender's game is a book for youth aged 10-16. My imaginiation wouldn't allow me the opportunity to enjoy this novel. I love science fiction but I think that Ender's Game fails at entertaining adult readers."
4,Great book,Excellent story that was unique and very interesting. I recommend this book but do not recommend the following books in the series.
5,Great!,Being only thirteen you may think that my review is pointless... Well screw you! I think this book captivates many emotions along with an exciting plot. I could never seem to put this book down. The way Ender changes throughout the book is ingenious! I can't say enough good things about this book. Anyone who likes a good read... BUY IT!!!
5,"I think this book is great, please email me if you liked it","I thought this book was so great that I even could not put it down, I just kept on reading,because there is so many exiting parts in it, like when you are about to put it down but you cant because right when you are another exciting part will happen and you will forget that you ever thought to put it down, it is so intence that any sifi reader would like it, any action or war reader would like it, and any person who likes will love it(because it talks about and expresses who Ender is and states how he feals about things) it is not just an all out war book, but the part that touched me was at the end, well i'll just let you read the end for yourself, and email me if you liked it, thanks for reading my statement and bye!!!!"
5,The storyline was invigorating and the author spectacular,"As fans we greatly appreciate the opportunity to express gratitude for such talent as Orson Scott Card. However, I wish that some who choose to express their opinion here would leave the loving in peace instead of berating us for our choice in science fiction, namely you, Houston. If you feel the need to belittle people as a 'public' in a place where we come together to celebrate, you have shared more about your character than you intended. As for Ender's Game, keep the torch alive! There are still many avid fans who appreciate all of Ender's adventures and Card's brilliant story telling. This is a series that will make you an Orson Scott Card fan for life."
2,Most overrated SF of all time.,"My father, a big SF reader, and my wife both absolutely raved about this book. I've also read a lot of scifi and thought I'd check it out. Well, the beginning was mildly intriguing. The middle was modestly interesting. I knew there had to be a fantastic twist and/or ending coming up. Nope. Kind of like a prime time TV show: midly entertaining gristle for your mind to chew on if there's not something truly insired around.So why all the hype? To this day I really can't tell you. Bad taste? Not having read anything better? A love of all things mediocre?"
2,Nowhere near as deserving of the esteem in-which it's held,"It's not a terrible book, but it left me wholly uninspired. The book's short length happened to be the only result of my bother to achieve the all-too-obvious ending which i had predicted not even half way in. A child prodigy chess-player is just as lame in a futuristic (video-game) setting as it is in real life."
3,Good writer. Less than meets the eye in the story.,"I read this ages ago as a short story. This author can writeso well you don't know you are reading, a bit like breathing.But, I must agree, this is not the best SF ever. Yes, tryFire on the Deep for more things to think about. This isimplausible and shallow. I do like well written drivelhowever, hence I'd score this more than 5."
5,The Best,"This is my absolute favorite book. Never before have I been able to recommend a book to all my friends and also have them all thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did. I adore books and reading altogether, but Ender's Game is the best book I have EVER read."
5,Ender's Game is a masterpiece.,"Ender's Game is Card's most popular book. I've read many of them and I believe this and it's sequel may be Card's crowning achievements. This one will keep you up late with stinging eyes, and you will not be able to put it down. This is a must read; it's good the second and third time too. You'll love this book."
3,Just as described,"I gave this item 3 stars entirely because of the shape that it was in. The company sent me the product in an extremely quick manner. They described the item as used but in good shape. I'd say it was used all right, but not in the best of shape. But then again, it was VERY inexpensive, so I'm a happy camper. :o)"
3,"An enjoyable read, but over-rated.","I've been hearing rave reviews about Enders Game for years. I read it last weekend and I did enjoy it, however, I do think some people adorned this story with too much praise. I'm not saying it was bad, it's just not the Sci-Fi genius I've been hearing (nor does it deserve a ""5 star"" rating). It kept me interested throughout, but I predicted the ending two chapters prior.For a decent Sci-Fi story, Ender's Game will do. If you desire more depth, read ""Battlefield Earth""."
5,Thoughtful and unique,"Ender's Game is a book that emblazons itself upon your psyche. The reader is immediately immersed in the adult-child war game realm of the characters and as pages turn you cannot help but to accept that human survival may depend on the creative thinking of a child. Of course, as the reader follows Ender's maturation as warrior and person there is the subltle recognition that children become adults two ways, gradually and then suddenly."
3,Okay.,"If you are wanting an action packed book this is not it. However, it is a great book that gets you thinking. Liked it a lot just had slow parts."
5,Great First Sci-Fi Book,"This was the first real Science Fiction book that I read and *really* liked. If you haven't read much Science Fiction, try this book, It's great."
4,I liked this book!!!!!!,"I liked the book, it was interesting. At times it was kind of boring at times, but than sometimes I could not put the book down because I could not wait to find out what would happen. The best part I thought was when he outsmarted the teachers and knew what they were doing. (Well, most of what they were doing) I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and has imagination and likes kids. I hope that everyone gets the chance to read this book. At first glance you think you don't want to read that book it is too long. But once you get into it, you are happy that you chose to read the book.Jackie"
4,Enjoyed to the End,very engaging book - good for teens and adults. I will probably pick up some of the sequels at some point...
5,Excellent book.,"Great book for children and adults. Anyone, even those who are not fans of science fiction, will find this book absolutely impossible to put down."
2,Just Okay,"In retrospect, this was a good story due to the superior last two chapters. The first thirteen chapters barely kept my interest. Through out those chapters, I found it very hard to relate to a bunch of seven and eight-year-olds who had the responsibility and intellect of grown men. I was also disturbed by what almost seemed like a deep seeded sexual interest between Ender and his sister. In the end, I almost didn't want to enjoy the last seventy pages because by that time I had so much resentment for the book--but those pages were just so good."
1,Meh. Take it or leave it,"I first read this book as an angst-ridden teen, and I thought it was great. That was a long time ago and I recently re-read it as an adult, hoping for the same great experience. Not so much.What seemed so deep and relevant to my 15 year old self was a little shallow to an adult. Not well written, the plot movement is glacial, the characters are very 2 dimensional. If you're still smarting over being picked on in school, you might find this interesting. If you've grown up and become an adult, probably less interesting. And, seriously, I'm waiting to stumble across Ender's Lunch, Ender's Afternoon Nap, Ender's Trip To The Grocery Store. Doesn't this author have any other ideas?"
5,Great read!,"I had not read any scifi in many years, but stumbled across a reference to Enders Game, so gave it a try. Very well written, in contrast to most scifi I remember, with interesting character development. An enjoyable read!"
5,My new obsession...,"...is taking the different strategy parallels Ender employs and transcribing it to my business model. A must read for any science fiction fan or business ""Art of War"" strategist."
5,Leadership Basics,"Not only is this one of the greatest sci-fi novels of all time, it is also a primer on leadership, its concepts, and application. This gift version is beautifully executed and worth the 12 and change it costs on Amazon. A worthy addition to any library, home, corporate, or otherwise."
1,Should NOT be on the reading list for children,"This book was on my daughter's middle school reading list. I have strongly objected with the school due to the profanity, depictions of women/girls as inferior, graphic sexual description, use of racial slurs, and acceptance of ""murder by the oppressed."" We should absolutely hold up the ideal to our kids and let them see good literature that is good reading, and enjoyable without all the profanity and objectionable themes. Ender's Game is not appropriate for this age, in my opinion. Ender's Game is not good literature."
5,Pure entertainment from start to finish.,"Excellent, excellent book. Scott Card really knows how to grab hold of your imagination and maintain a strong grip on it. Very interesting ideas used in addition to the great suspense. There wasn't a single chapter I found myself unsatisfied with. An all around powerful novel, and I would recommend it to anyone with a thirst for action."
5,My only Sci-fi,"I am by no means a sci-fi fan, but this book is enough to convert me. It sat on my book shelf for ages, finally I picked it up, and couldn't put it down. Ender is an advanced child groomed to be a leader, taken through a battery of physical and mental anguish, that we can all in someway relate to. From start to finish this book flys by."
1,"Sould be a ""Pop-Up Book.""","Who are the people that are writing stellar reviews on this book? Five year olds? At best, this is a children's book for simpletons."
2,Really dumb...,"This is a totally forgettable book... the plot is ludicrous, the characters lack depth, and, well, it just bored me to tears. Ender, the Boy-Napoleon, who trains to command vast star fleets by playing the future's version of a zero-gravity paint-ball game... and his brother who gains control of the world by starting-out as an anonymous adolescent blogger. PLEASE!"
4,Short encourage SCI FI and psychological romp.,"Walking into the readably acclaimed ""Ender's Game"", I was preparing myself for disappointment. Not unlike tasting a dish at a restaurant that has rave reviews, one sets themselves up for the expected disappointment. Your imagination and expectations oft times lead yourself to anticipate a greater delight than delivered.I am happy to say that this book did not deliver. It completely failed and I loved it for it. It did not pander to my expectations, did not leave me predicting each new development of the plot. In its places, this story delivered a rich and thorough accounting of Ender and his own internal dilemma's. A fresh (ironically) and rewarding journey.I would, and do, happily recommend this to not only avid science fiction readers, but anyone in need of a break from reality.In short, Ender's Game, while brief, is a rich and rewarding read. 4/5."
5,Can't wait to read the rest of the books,"I think the foreword by Card made it even more helpful to approach his style of writing. Talking to others who have already read his books, Card describes his approach well, and it was god preparation for what I was about to read and allowed me to relate to the author as I flipped the pages. I could not put this book down, and could resonate with the theme of feeling like the misunderstood youngster who can't seem to find a niche in life without feeling isolated from all the other niches. Can't wait to get to the next book!"
5,Ender's Game: A review,"Ender's Game: A review, by Jay of LondonEnder is a 6-year-old genius at the beginning of our book, when he gets the Moniter removed. Ender believes that he can go back to a ""normal"" life, after having the goverment retract their Moniter, and Peter, his brother who (to put it nicly) is a future Exterminator (not really, power-hungrey Peter gets what he wants, and deserves, in the end), anyways, Peter will start having a ""brotherly"" relationship with him.Then Colenel Graff comes and whisks Ender off to Battle School. There Ender learns to be a good soilder through isolation, games, ""Fairyland"", and using his own creativity.Valentine, the only one who loves him, (his parents do, but it gets complicated), ends up siding with Peter, in a plot to take over the world.I'll leave it at that, but just know that this is one of the best books I've ever read."
1,Don't buy the Kindle edition!,"Great book, but the Kindle edition is a huge rip off. It's obvious the publisher just tossed a copy in a scanner and didn't even bother to read through what came out on the other side. Ail instead of all, tmst instead of trust, etc. Many pages have more than one typo per page. Wish we could get our money back."
5,This is the best book ever!,This is my favorite book ever. If u like sci-fi read it! Anyone who doesn't like it is stupid cuz they don't get it so read it
3,It was an interesting read.,"I was new to sci-fi books when I picked up Ender's Game. It came highly recommended by friends who had also recommended books like the Rama series by Aurther C Clarke.Ender's Game was fair. The ending was unpredictable but also a big let down. I won't spoil it for you, but the entire book prepares you for this big battle with the aliens and never quite delivers."
5,Ender's Game,Loved this book. One of my favorites. Wonderful main character and unusual setting. I think a teenage boy would like this as much as an adult.
3,Does not deserve it's vaunted status.,"""Ender's Game"" is a rather amateurishly written book that partially redeems itself in the last twenty or so pages. Some intriguing (but half-baked) ideas and a couple of interesting pontifications on the nature of information/power/education are undermined by silly & unbelievable dialog, sketchy characterizations, and some truly head-shakingly awful writing. The only thing that saves this book from well-deserved placement on my Ten Most Overrated Books list is the plot twist that leads to a satisfying conclusion. Still, I can think of a considerable number of books that are more deserving of hype that surrounds this overrated tome.I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but I guess I'll round it up to 3; I think this book would go over better with someone under the age of 16."
3,Enjoyable Genre Piece,Will appeal to alienated nerds who will rightly or wrongly identify with the protagonist. The enthusiasm and sheer number of reviewers of the book is notable.Somewhat troubling ambivalence and rationalization of genocide.
5,"Not a Sci-Fi Fan, but loved this book","What a great book. Interesting, literate, and just wonderful. I finished it then started to buy more Orson Scott Card books. Ender is a fascinating Character. The book is great for adults and children. I totally recommend it."
4,"Yall, I'm Orson Scott Card Fan for real now","This is a brilliantly written book. Pure Sci-fi and with a twister at the end. I won't blow the surprise for yall, you have to read it. I'm onto Enders Shadow now!"
4,This book reverberates for days. But....,"This is a book I really enjoyed reading. Quick-paced, visceral yet sparse in detail. Full of humanity and spirit. I'd love to share it with my young nephew but...There are two passages in this book that would prohibit it from being part of any school-sponsered reading list. And both passages do nothing to enhance the story, The ""N"" word and the word ""kike"" even spoken in jest by a character just doesn't sit well with most people nowadays. I know from Orson Scott Card's Foreward that he is not against revisions. I suggest he removes these two racial slurs. It would turn my 4 star into a 5."
5,Simply the best book ever written.,Enders Game is the best book ever written. The plot was incredible. After the first few pages I couldn't put the book down.
5,Phenomenal,"I have read a lot (a lot) of science fiction in my lifetime, and only two books have forced me to read them straight through without stopping, skipping classes and sleep. The other is Heinlen's Starship Troopers. Phenomenal book."
5,Well written book,I couldn't put this book down. Every chapter got better and better. I want to read all of Orson Scott Card's books after this one.
1,Written for a 12 yr old video gaming audience,I don't think I've been more bored by any other book (Except perhaps Anna Karenina). But at least Anna Karenina was well written. This book is not.
5,This will become a sci-fi classic after generations.,The actual point is 9.9. The only thing that keep me from giving it 10 is because my belief that nobody is perfect.But what OSC did is close to perfection. My sincere congratulation to him
5,The BEST!!,"Earth has been attacked twice, and no one wants to see it happen again. And so the fate of the world falls onto the shoulders of the greatest military genius ever--a six-year-old boy named Andrew Wiggen, known as Ender. ""Ender's Game"" is the best book that I have ever read, and I recommend it wholeheartedly"
5,Why can't you negatories judge a story on its own merits?,"It's actually a 9.99999, but hey, who's counting? it lack's that .00001 of a point only in the hopes and knowledge that there will always be another excellent story down the road that can stand next to this one.People who search for THE sci-fi book crack me up. Even those who ridicule the others and give EG a 1 or 6, because they're doing the same thing--looking at EG in RELATION to all the others. Just read it andSTOP COMPARING--read it and judge it on its own merits"
4,Join the Game...,"Welcome to the world of Ender, an oppressed genius of a boy who find himself recruited for the space army at the age of six. The boy surpassed the greatest expectations of the system, and is promoted...to what? Pck up Ender's game, and read it cover to cover like i did, and you will be sure to find out, and have a philosophical, entertained time of it while you're at it. And don't let his genius brother and sister slip through your fingers, as they plot to take over the world through diplomacy, with methods never before used. not really a childrens book, and optimal for young adults with a taste for deep science fiction with a somewhat sophisticated touch."
4,Good Read.,"I had to read this book for my English 250 class. At first I was not so excited to read a science fiction novel. However, Card does a great job with this, and this book really impressed me. It was well written, easy to read, and carried a good story that left you wondering ""what next"" until the very last page."
5,Orson Scott Card greatest work and one of my favorites,"It has been a couple of years since I've humbly bought and read the revised hardcover edition of Ender's Game from Amazon and still I waiting for a moment to pick it up again. I was simply amazed at the character of Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin and how smart and vigilante he was when it came to his surroundings, let alone the science fiction space element. Ender's Game while reading you feel connected with the characters and their lives and almost makes you feel like your with them in deep space. Orson Scott Card did a fabulous job when it came to writing this novel. It's so good that I compare it's excellence to my other favorite Sci-Fi novel: Dune by Frank Herbert, which is basically a favorite of mine I can't seem to put in words. Anyway go buy Ender's Game if your interested in a not only intelligent scifi read but a great romp through space as well.Enjoy!"
3,Space Football,This is not really science fiction and it's a mystery how it won the Hugo award. Card himself says that he doesn't know much about science so he's written a story about a bunch of jocks preparing for a 3D football game. If that's interesting then I suppose that this book is O.K.
5,Amazing Card can write like that.,"A long book. Slow in some parts, but kept my intrest.A kid when he enters the academy, taken away from all of his family, a leader and a man when he comes out after a long and very real battle."
4,Fantastic Sci-Fi Literature,"Ok, i know my review may be a bit biased, since i am a huge fantasy and sci-fi buff, but i still think this is a truly awesome book. Ender is a very complex character to figure out, as he has many, many different sides to him, and the intricate weaving of the plot is phenomenal. I can also relate to Ender, because i am also different from most kids my age (they consider me very bright, kind of like Ender, but i dont wanna brag), and I think he did a good job of coping with things the way he did.The reason i only give it four stars is because i dont think it is necessary to have such crude language in this story (or some of the crude images of the goings-on in the barrackses). Overall, however, i think this is a very good story that every sci-fi fan should read."
5,All Time Favorite Book,"I have returned to this book time and time again over the last decade. It is my all time favorite book. Not only is it easy to read, but it's a quick read with a great story."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it.,"Something different, kept me reading and thinking.I'd give it 4.5 if I could and would recommend it to anyone whom likes thinking!"
3,"Worth reading, but doesn't live up to the hype","Everyone raves about this book, so I was eager with anticipation when I began to read it. I struggled to get into the story from the inital few pages. The style is average, the characters are relatively flat and undeveloped, and the action is nothing special. The ending is very good and redemptive, but even this doesn't warrant a higher review. I know this borders on sacrilege for some, as this book won both the Hugo and the Nebula (something 17 other books have done, by the way!), but this book just didn't deliver as promised. That being said, it is worth reading; just temper your expectations."
1,Not for kids. Horrible.,"This book left me feeling awful. How the kids were treated was sickening-even the adult characters in the book thought it was sickening. I wanted so badly to see the character grow with his age but it never happens. No morals, virtues or honor to be gained from this story! The story lacks direction and climax. Drones on and on in some parts...in other parts as quickly as it gains your attention, it extinguishes it. Horrible book for kids to read-especially considering all the crap going on with the shootings in Connecticut! I would ban this book from kids if I could."
1,"Another Boring Mega-Series, Or Life inside a Video Game","If you like shallow characters and a story that reads like a video game, dig in. I got suckered into this one and dutifully plodded along until the main character became 'one with the ants' (after destroying their entire civilization)! I can't beleive the author had the nerve to write sequels (do I hear a k-ching k-ching?). And such a symbolic name for a guy that destroys worlds - Ender!SF has become a pile of criminal garbage - stuff like this just adds to the heap.So Look up Sheep and stop buying this junk. Ask for real SF!If I could give this one a zero I would."
5,I found it extremely difficult to put this book down.,I found it extremely difficult to put this book down. From the onset this book is a gripping taleof a boy who is forced into manhood by circumstances. Ender is truly somebody who hasshown that he can handle adversity and come outon top.
3,100 Words or Less,"This is supposedly a Sci-Fi Classic, and Card almost made the grade. Is it good? Absolutely. And sometimes surprising. Yet, the plot seems repetitive and the main character doesn't evolve much. So does it belong with the greats of that genre? Hmmm. I don't think so. Oh, I still highly recommend it, but only because it sets up a much greater book, its sequel ""Speaker for the Dead"". Combine these 2 together, and then you do have a true classic, a truly great unfolding of a unique character."
4,The best action science fiction since Starship Troopers,An excellent book - well written and zippy with nice character development and an interesting plot twist. Some in my book group thought the main characters unbelievable because their skill and age levels were incompatible; science fiction does require some imagination. I would have given Ender's Game all the stars if i hadn't seen the conclusion coming. Perhaps i was receiving telepathic signals from another civilization...
5,Ender's Game is going to be influential Sci-fi novel!,"My birthday is coming up soon, and, this is a book I want. Not only do I like Sci-fi/Fantasy novels, but this one has been recomended to me countless times.It'll be very disturbing and disapointing if this novel doesn't juxtapose with my reading intrests."
3,worth reading,"I read this book about my senior year in High School and was very impressed. I think it is probably worth your reading if you are heavy into Sci-Fi. Card has an amazing mind and Ender is one of the most original characters in fiction. I haven't read the sequels, but given the free time I might. I give the book 3.5 out of 5, but I favor more Asimov style Sci-Fi. If your into the whole political/military-future thing you might rate it higher. On the down side; This book will tend to wear you out at times."
5,A literary masterpiece,"Full of friendship, hate, suspense and suprise enders game turns unenthusiastic readers into a lovers of literature. A unique story of a child twisted and manipulated into war general to face intergalactic enemies. I recomend it to all ages above 12 do to vulgar and profane attributes of the book."
3,African Nights by Kuki Gallmann,"This book was very interesting, descriptive, mystical and provocative. I enjoyed reading the details that painted a picture of Kenya in my head. The short stories were often touching, tragic, joyful, and sometimes unbelievable. I thought this was definitly worth reading, but you should borrow it from a friend, the library or buy it used because it isn't nearly as good as Kuki's first book I Dreamed of Africa."
5,Amazing book....really,"honestly, this book is amazing. It covers all the usual claims, and debunks them top to bottom. Its alot of information, but its really easy to read. I totally recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves debating!"
1,shooting fish in a barrel,"When I got this book I told my mom, open it to 3 randon pages and let me have it. 1. pg 183 ANWR, easy I live in Alaska. ""Scientists estimate there are between 6 and 16 billions of recoveravable oil in ANWR-an amount that would dramatically reduce our dependence of foreign oil."" Well the US uses 6.6 billion barrels of oil per year. Do the math or find ex Secretary Gail Nortons press conference explaining same. That was funny.2. pg 49 impies founders put In God We Trust on US money, Well In God We Trust was put on paper money during the 50s, I think 1957 during the McCarthey commie scares. The coin in very late 1800,s. Little past the framers lifetime, yes?.pg 218. There have been no terrorist attacks on US soil since 9/11. Really, tell that to the people who died by the anthrax mail attacks FOLLOWING 9/11. Did we ever catch those responsible?, did we look?""you can have your own opinions, but not your own facts. Wake up, Sheople."
3,The truth hurts but has to be addressed.,common sense is so hard to come by in the political world of DC but this book puts it where the common people live. Although a little too far right in my opinion but I highly recommend this book.
2,Do you really need this book?,"Although I've only read excerpts, I'm not impressed with this book as it doesn't strive to create a more informed public; but rather acts as a resource for people who consider themselves to be conservative but don't truly know why. Any informed conservative of average intelligence needs no help in formulating a response to issues with which they disagree. I'm left with the impression that this book differs very little from the tactics commonly employed by the very people the book is designed to debunk."
1,Waste of money,this is a waste of money without anything new to add. I wish I wouldn't have spent my stretch money.
1,Pure Trash,Don't waste your time. Total garbage. Totally lacking in truth or facts. I wish I would have known that it was pure propoganda before I read it.Ideas found here are a threat to our democracy. We are drowning in propoganda and this book is pure propoganda. It serves the interests of the plutocracy.Full of falsehoods which promote corporate interests.
1,Waste of my time,"Way too much negative commenting for me. if you like getting angry for no apparent reason, or because it""is the thing to do"" go ahead with this. If you are looking for educated and solid ways to back your opinions, get another book."
1,Light reading to put you to sleep,"A sad piece of prose, that rehashes lame responses for a debate with someone you disagree with. Rodney Dangerfield the author is not."
1,More propagnda & lies,A guide book for idiots who cannot think on their own. Typical for the brianwashed right in America. Nothing new here don't waste your money.
1,Great comebacks...If you want to lose!,Just a terrible book. Who writes this kind of drivel? It might as well be a handbook to bringing fascism to America.
1,Junk propaganda,More of the same lame propaganda churned out every election year geared to those unable to think critically and those ignorant of history.
1,Moronic,"Moronic. Save your time and money. This is badly reasoned fodder for morons who can't reason critically or present their own thoughts coherently. It's unlikely this book would help them. Then again, holding conservative beliefs has never been about facts, so offering help to argue conservative beliefs is an oxymoron."
4,How thw swans came to the lake,"I've been interested in the history of Buddhism and zen in the west for a number of years and was fortunate to pick out ""How the Swans Came to the Lake"" from the library at Mt. Baldy Zen Center in March.I found the work to be a well told story. The detail of the common threads and relationships is fascinating. I really think this book is an important piece for anyone interested in how this wonderful flowering of the Dharma in the West was planted and fed."
2,napalm burns,"On this album, Napalm Death creates something a bit more experimental than many of their earlier works. I would say that I am chiefly a fan of their earlier (1987-1989) work, but I also like much of their early 90's stuff as well. This is definitely not something that those with similar tastes (for more of the speed metal and grind core) will appeal to. Bravo ND for creating the grindcore genre, but shouldn't songs rannge anywhere from 4 seconds to a minute and a half tops? I suppose that I do find a few songs on this album appealing, but what are their titles?"
1,Buyer Beware,"Note that the photo used for this product shows HP's most current packaging. The cartridge I received was in older packaging, and the cartridge performed exactly as you'd expect from a five- or more-year-old toner cartridge: printing was very faint and streaked--worse than the output from the nearly depleted cartridge I wanted to replace. The cartridge was unusable, in other words. Note also that nearly all the more recent reviews posted here mention the same problem. Amazon took the cartridge back and refunded my money, but I'm disappointed to see that they continue to sell via this supplier. In my experience, what you see is not what you get. Also, the $126.25 list price given for this cartridge is deceptively inflated--HP itself sells the cartridge for $87.99 with free next day shipping."
2,c3903a,"I referred to ""c3903a"".However, c3906a was also displayed.I have chosen the different thing c3906a.I am regretful."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Like Computers That Crash,"One month after switching from a PC, the hard drive or OS crashed, causing me to lose all my data when I had to reload the OS. Apple refused to send a new iMac or give a refund. And that was after a month of enduring all sorts of application crashes. The so-called easy-to-use interface is completely counterintuitive, too. So, if you like hard-to-use computers that are completely unreliable, this is the buggy hardware for you!"
5,A solid compilation,"VERY different from other Hed Kandi type albums - winter chill provides an eclectic mix of downbeat but involved songs. Some are very new (Sugababes 'stronger'), while others have been around for nearly a decade (Mazzy Star 'flowers in December') - but all strong tracks that together make a great soundtrack for what (I think) would be a fabulous movie. Best surprise track for fans of ""Six Feet Under"" is on disc 1 Sia, ""Breathe Me"" this was the song played in the very end of the last episode - it's a cryer.Other highlights, Goldfrap, Lamb, Frou Frou, Eventide, and Snow Patrol - chances are if you love one of those artists, you'll like, or love, the others too.Not so great - the instrumentals (disc 1; tracks 8, 9 - which are... well boring).I reccomend this album to those who loved the Garden State soundtrack - but I would go so far as to say this is better... yes better."
1,"Cheap product, no longevity.","I have gone through 3 Pur water filters over the past two years. I will not buy their products any longer. All their faucet filters seem to be prone to leaks within a few months of usage. This product in particular is coated with a chrome colored film that chips away and looks bad, even if the seals were to hold out for more than a few months. If these filters had any longevity they would be great, they are good while they last. But they don't last long enough to be worth the money. I'm going to research the market and make a purchase based upon the units longevity, even if the filters aren't available locally it will be worth it to get them on line rather than replacing the hole filtration unit every 4 to 8 months."
1,Used to be good...now they're JUNK.,"Just like everyone else has said, the old Pur filters were great. Unfortunately, when I moved from TN to FL I left my old one and had to buy a new unit. I purchased one for my mom at the same time. They are both squirting water in different directions all over our kitchens and it's been less than 9 months. These are NOT the same filtration units that used to be made by Pur....these are junk. Not sure what I'm going to do now. Maybe see how awful tap water really is without filtration?"
1,Check out the publisher's website,"First, I must share I have not read this book...I do not want to add to the publisher's coffers. The publisher states about this book: ""I am the editor, publisher, and contributor of the book....That is my statement,"" speaking about the publisher's mission, which includes defaming many Christian authors and church leaders. I would encourage anyone who is interested in this book to FIRST check out the publisher's website [...] and read through some of the material there. I have done so and found that the quotes I researched were taken out of context and twisted to change the meaning of what the author originally intended. If you really want to read about the validity of contemplative Christianity and spiritual formation, there are MANY periodical articles, easily found on the internet, which provide unbiased reporting on both sides of the issue for your consideration."
1,Religion has always and will always change and evolve,"It's hard for some to believe, but it is what it is. Christianity is not what it was 50 years ago, which is not what it was 150, and so on. It is not the same religion it was during the crusades, nor the inquisitions. It changes with the times. It is a creation of man and controlled by man. Christianity itself is an evolution of judaism.People should be content with people who are kind and caring and good hearted, despite any religion or lack there of they may have."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is very useful to identify the false teaching and apostasy that is going on in the church today. This is my 4th copy, I have given three away. I recommend it highly. For more information you can also use the Light House Trails Research website for a resource."
4,Mystery and not yucky love story.,I throughly enjoyable book with a heroine that you can't help but want to read more of. This is the first of her books that I have read. Today I ordered four or five more!!
1,BEWARE of 'Library Binding',"This is nothing but the paperback except worse: smaller print, newsprint paper. you're paying $16.99 for a pasteboard cover and the worst paper possible. Normal 'Library Binding' means even heavier construction than the regular hardback edition. BEWARE! Great story."
4,"Okay, but...","When package arrived, one item had obviously been previously opened and haphazdarly repackaged. Items were all there, but the packaging was very messy."
5,Beautiful,This is a wonderful addition to any Christmas decor. Beautifully made and made to last. Helps to remind of us the true meaning of Chrsitmas.
5,Willow tree set,"This was a gift to my daughtewe and she was thrilled to have such a timeless nativity set, at a reasonable price . She plans to add to it yearly."
5,Willow Tree Nativity,"My husband purchased the creche and the starter nativity set for me for Christmas and told me I could go ahead and get the other pieces on line because the local merchant didn't have the extra pieces. I have just received the three wiseman and I am awaiting the arrival of two stars, the shepherd and animals and the song of life angel. I marvel everytime I add a piece to my set. I look at it and my heart is filled with joy at the birth of our Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ. I am anxious to get the other pieces to complete my set. I will leave this out all year long as a reminder of what Christmas, and everyday, is really all about, and because I just love looking at it!"
5,Beautiful!,"I only have the basic set (Mary & baby, Joseph, shepherd boy, etc) so I was thrilled when my husband gave the stars to me for my birthday! They look beautiful and add a specialness to my little set. Such a simple addition, but big impact :)The stars have a heavier base than I anticipated, but it makes it very stable. A nice, solid piece!"
5,Great company,Arrived even before the arrival date and everything that I expected! Pieces were all packed well and no broken parts.
2,willow tree creche,My reason for rating this product with two stars is that the base of it is warped (unlevel). I expected quality workmanship for the price that I paid for the item.
3,Missing piece,The creche is missing the star which attaches to the roof.The Navity set is beautiful ; more than I expected!
4,a real thoughtfull character movie.honest and down to earth.,this is a rare film.i think james mangold is a good director.his style differs from the norm.pruitt taylor vince as a downtrodden overwheight chef in hopeless love is more than excellent.liv tyler is not only good looking but a great actress with a very sincere style of her own(watch the airfield scene).it would be a shame if her talent becomes overlooked.what i like most is the characters all have a stubborn reluctance that does not give away to quick happy changes like the usual hollywood stereotypes.vince is so endearing he is hard to forget long after the movie is over.i encourage more of this type of film.
3,This book is now obsolete.,"Well, I bought this bought and quickly discovered that I was wasting my time and money. Microsoft has now introduced Visual Basic 2005 Express. You can download it free from Microsoft, along with some good documentation on learning.At this point, there is no point in working on VB.Net. Go right to the newest (free) product for programming.If you want a good book on Visual Basic 2005, try Michael Halvorson's Microsoft VisualBasic 2005 Step by Step.But don't waste you money on this book...as I did."
2,Worked perfectly ... for 5 months,"I purchased this cable on November 12th, 2010. 3 days ago (April 10th, 2011) it started shorting out. It hasn't been moved since purchase. It is attached firmly to my DVR and my receiver. I tested my DVR with a separate digital optical cable and it worked fine. I then tested my blu-ray player with this digital optical cable and, as with my DVR, the sound went in and out. The problem is definitely the cable.Prior to April 10th, I would have given this cable a 5 out of 5. It sounds great when it's working and it's sold at a great price. But even at this low price, a cable should last more than 5 months. Maybe I just ended up getting a dud. Either way, it worked for 5 months and then it didn't, and that's disappointing."
3,Good quality cables BUT...,"The cable is of good quality and the wires are well shielded... BUT here's the catch and why it lost a coupe of stars.The connectors on both ends are just about a millimeter too thick, so they did not snap into my Samsung TV and my sound system but just fine on my other TV. It just depends on what you are connecting it too.The fix is easy though - just shave off the top (grey) part of the connector a little with a knife and the cable snaps right in. I have no complaints with it otherwise. Just needed a couple of minutes of extra work on it."
3,It works but...,"The only problem I had with this optical wire was that typically when connecting this type of wire into a socket it will ""click"" in, though I have tried testing it in my personal sound system, my xbox 360, and my living room home theater system and it seems to have a very loose fit, maybe I got the wrong size? Though I assumed all optical wires had the same shape and size etc.Other than that it still transfers perfectly fine. I would have just liked a little more stabilization in the ends."
5,Works good for intended purpose. Not for my purposes.,"Works very well as an optical audio cable, nice length and whatnot. BUT it melted when I took a blowtorch to it so it's not really what I am looking for."
3,Below Par,The behind the scenes action of this software slows downloads. It also crashes Netscape V 8.2 when I attempt to open a message on the Yahoo Finance message Board for UTX! Good thing I did not get rid of Netscape 7.2.
3,Not for old computers,"After installing the program, my computer crawled so slow it was impossible to use. I installed more memory and it helped, but I finally uninstalled it. Now my computer is back to normal."
1,poorly written and difficult to remove,"This is one of the worst name brand software products I've seen. I have been using Norton for years, and this one had completely diabled my mom's machine (it slowed down the machine incredibly and disabled several programs, including MS Office). We've spent hours working through the problems with tech support. They refunded her money, but it still took me several additional hours to remove the program (in a few months I'll have a PhD in computer science).If you do an appropriate internet search (ex norton 2007 problem) you'll find I'm not the only one with problems."
1,Preceed with Extreme Caution,"I had 2006 and got tired of the nagging messages for 2 months from Norton to upgrade. So I got Norton Internet Security 2007. When I tried to install it tried to unintall Norton 2006 and couldn't do it sucessfully. In fact it caused a fatal error that almost destroyed my OS.So I had to call HP for support cause it would only boot to a blue screen, pull memory cards and cables, use Registry Mechanic and The Ultimate Troubleshooter to pull some more Norton out manually and remove some startup files.Today I downloaded a Norton Removal tool from their site, and hopefull this will actually remove their bugware, and 2007 will install. If not, I'm going to Macafee if that will even install without Norton completely removed. Thanks a million, Symantec. 1 Star."
2,Not user friendly,"Norton has come a long way since this version. This one was just not friendly to the user. Most PC users don't want to work with the Internet Security software. To be honest, I don't think the security parameters that I set changed anything."
5,Easy to use and setup,"I'mnot a computer guy - I'm an outdoor guy but I do not like to have my computers screwed up with viruses and the like. This software was so easy to install, setup and run. A child could do it...ok a grandmother could do it. I have not had any problems with any of my computers since this software was installed."
2,2007 Software Should Be Vista Compatible,"As of September 2007, Vista has been the default Windows platform for one year. As a result I feel that all 2007 software should be Vista compatible. While the Norton Internet Security package is usuable for my wife's XP laptop, it is useless for my new Vista desktop. That one must purchase 2008 software in the last quarter of 2007 is a travesty. This only shows the greed of software manufacturers like Norton to boost their sales by requiring more money spent to use the next year's software in order to accomodate a platform that has been on the market for an entire year. For this reason I give Norton and all other 2007 software packages that are not Vista compatible no higher than a ""2"" out of ""5."""
3,"Does the job, but resource hog","Seems to have protected my systems, but some (not all) of them have much slower boot times after installation."
4,Internet Security,"I think this is one of the better Security suites Symantec has produced.The only downfall is the 3 user license. They go quickly. If you need to re-load for example on the same machine as I did when upgrading to Windows Vista, that counted as 2, and had it loaded on my laptop. If you encounter a problem and need to re-load again. Your out of luck. This info is kept in your personal user account at their website. So each time you load the software it registers the usage."
4,Norton Internet Security 2007,Please with the program and operation.A little different from the 2005 version I was using
1,A remedy worse than the disease?,"Various professional reviews give Norton high marks for worm and spyware detection and the like, and I have no reason to dispute them. But I suspect Norton is as bad as what it guards against in terms of its effect on computer performance. A quick startup to check on weather, say, or check on e-mail, no longer is possible: the hard drive buzzes, time goes by, the hard drive buzzes some more. Microsoft's Task Manager makes it clear that Norton is the culprit. And whenever Norton decides, as it often does, to update, or check for updates, Internet performance drops well into the SERIOUS frustration zone. Can Norton be temporarily disabled? Elements of the program can be turned off, but then Norton finds other things to do, and the frustration in unabated. My sincere, heartfelt recommendation: find better security software."
3,Norton I Suite 2007,Slows my computer down considerably. I will more than likely use different software such as Zone Alarm Pro along with AVG free edition. Bothr of those programs run smoothly and do not slow my machine down.
1,Couldn't get it to work on either of my laptops,I couldn't detect a USB memory drive on either of my laptops - a dell latitude 620 (New) and Thinkpad T20 (old). Sending it back as non-functional. Waste of time for me.
1,Don't bother,"I bought this in early March, hoping I could use it to download video off of an old camcorder on to an external hard drive. The USB ports worked for a while with a scanner, but never seemed to recognize the external drives. I came back to the video project this week, attempted to plug in the power cable and heard a SNAP inside the casing. Prying it off, i found the plug in for the power cable had broken off the circuit board, rendering the card useless. Amazon says it's beyond the return time so in to the trash it goes."
2,Buy a different brand--this thing is junk,"I've owned this for several years. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes devices attached are recognized, sometimes they're not. Also, it's not Linux compatible (if you care about such things.)UPDATE: I bought a D-Link DUB-C2 USB PCMCIA Card 2 x USB 2.0 to replace this, and it works great for me. A lot of people on Amazon gave it poor reviews though, so perhaps this sort of device is kind of hit-and-miss depending on what model of computer and/or software it's used with."
1,Don't waste your time,"This card is the biggest piece of crap ever made. It doesn't even really work right. the USB works.... sort of. after installing all the special drivers to trick your system into thinking that this is a real USB 2.0 card, it only works with certain devices. regardless of the use of the optional DC plug-in power. and don't even get me strarted on the firewire. another ""intermittent"" and selective device. Works when you're using realy old devices, but forget using anything new with it."
1,Worthless - does not work with Treo 600,"This headset does not ""disable"" the speakerphone and consequently: 1) people have to hear your thru the phone not the headset 2) mute does not work properly."
1,does not work with handspring treo 600,I have an old treo 600 (in fact is a handspring not a palmone)the headset does not work. Maybe it will work with a palmone treo 600
3,An old video,"Note the date in the title (i.e. 1991). I didn't see that and bought the DVD thinking it was a new release with updated concepts. It turned out to be an old VHS tape (that I bought 10 years ago) simply put onto DVD with some new cover packaging. The ability to go to specific chapters is a nice feature of DVD, but you can probably buy the old VHS (Short Game) for a lot less."
4,La Complicada Futilidad de la Ignorancia,"Alex Newport ha plasmado en Complicated Futility of Ignorance, trabajo final de este britanico power trio la mezcla de un trash con la densidad del Death y el grind pero con un concepto pensante y existencialista lo cual todo puesto junto conforma un album fascinante y por demas eclectico, el aspero sonido de los riffs alcanza niveles atmosfericos, como en ""random acts of cruelty"" o ""circle of friends,circle of trends"" el intro para ""cover up"" es realmente cautivador y excitante la ruidosa estatica de las cuerdas de Newport tocada alreves con notable distorsion y voces fraseando cosas nada entendibles lo que da una sensacion de estar descendiendo al mismisimo infierno todo en unos cuantos segundos y entonces el estallido de dicho track rodea el ambiente, este es un album basico si te gusta Fudge Tunnel junto con Creep Diets.HM"
5,Great colors,"Used them on white fabric, followed the directions, dried it, put in dryer for an hour, washed and dried again. Looks as good as beginning."
5,One of his best shows ever,"Usually Eddie Izzard takes a little while to get into his act, but in Glorious he gets right into it. Starting with the Old Testament, he works his way up through history, including the Trojan War, and Finishing with the New Testament. It definitely is one of his best shows ever."
4,Correction to previous review,"Actually, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood was Hassan al-Banna, in 1928. Sayyid Qutb was one of the Brotherhood's most widely known thinkers in the 50's and 60's, but he was not the founder."
1,Extremist ideologue's bankrupt,"Qutb's elevation of offensive jihad to and above the five pillars of Islam, his impossible idea of banishing the 'kingdom of man' (even in an Islamic society, people ultimately have to make decisions), and his rabid anti-Semitism make it no wonder that radicals and terrorists found inspiration in his intolerant views. This book is the work of a sad man, wallowing in prison, unable to cope with the modern world, and longing for some golden age of purity which never existed."
5,Great for Entrepreneurs,"I love this magazine. It isn't covered in ads, and the articles are varied enough to keep it interesting every time. I like reading about start-ups, franchise owners, small business owners, and wage-slave-turned-millionaire stories. It's also tech-savvy and geared toward a younger (20-40) audience, not to people who ran businesses thirty years ago."
1,Skip this book,"Infantile, cardboard cutout characters reduce this novel to wondering what a good writer could do this this storyline. Also there could have been move of a technical explanation of what happened to allow SIRAT to ""think"". All in all this theme has been done better."
3,Great Product but...,"Since we have birds and cannot use sprays,we use Fly Strips. TAT works better than most in that flies seem to be attracted to it. However I thought the 98% savings on the price sounded too good to be true but decided to give it a shot. The $87.89 price listed is for a case of 24 packages. For a $1.75, plus $6.++ shipping, you get one package. If you have a True Value or Ace Hardware anywhere close, you can get the same thing for less than $3.The product is good, the ad is deceptive."
1,It doesn't work !,This is the worst fly season I have ever seen in central Calif. I got an 8 pack of Tat. I see 10 to 12 flies flying in circles in the kitchen and bathroom most of the time. It's horrible. I put out one strip in each room for 2 weeks. I got 3 flies. The strips are about 2 feet from the circling flies. This stuff couldn't work any worse if you put fly repelent on it.
4,A perfect little treasure chest,"I bought this for my granddaughter and also one for a neighbor girl. I filled the box with small trinkets, hair ties, string bracelets, lip gloss, a few dollars and candy gold coins and treated it as a treasure chest. I saw my granddaughter's interest and excitement while going through the tiny compartments and she's only 3. Since she has shown an interest recently in treasure chests, I thought she would like this and she definitely did!"
3,ok stuff,"Katrina Kaif is again brilliant and natural here after ""Zindagi na milegi dobara"" .Her scooter stint with Imran may remind you of Roman Holiday starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck.She is quite like a little girl in some scenes truly enjoying herself seem very spontaneous rather than flat acting.Camera seems to love her.In the starting she may not be as good but as the movie progresses her character too blooms.Her first scene is quite funny where she serves tea to Imran who first stares blankly at her then gets really freaked out and shocked and drops tea on his pants.Film is quite well written not stupid like recent movies.Songs just come and go..At PVR Phoenix a strange thing happened like in Harry Potter they had regurgitating toilets.Whole Washroom overflowing.Really weird how did that happen?"
3,Great Material; Cheesy Book!,"Passmore did a fine job of collecting many pieces of information about Jan and Dean, and then putting those pieces together to form a cohesive and interesting book. Speaking of ""the book,"" the quality is Neanderthal, what with it being paperback and containing ONLY black and white photographs. Come on, folks. For 26 bucks, one would at least expect a nice collection of color photos! The reading material is a must for Jan and Dean fans, but the esoteric quality of the book, itself, leaves much to be desired."
2,Not extremely helpful to the artist.,"The pictures and listing of anatomical features is not a big help for artists. A better choice would be Hogarth's other book, ""Dynamic Figure Drawing"""
4,Great Book,Very detailed sketches and information. Always good to have several anatomy books on hand and this should be one of them. Great book for any artist. Certainly worth the cost.
3,"Great book with lots of reference, but some views not shown","I've referred to this book time and time again for details when drawing a figure to get correct muscle position. It comes in very handy. My only complaint is that some positions just aren't shown. Most drawings are drawn from an angled position so you still can't get a good idea of the depth of the muscle. Also at times, I'll refer to the book to see what a region looks like only to find that the piece I'm interested in is obscured in every rendering, the underside/back of the arm being one such place."
3,Great content but terrible proof-reading,"The number of typos and other errors in this book is astounding. I love all of these stories and am happy to have them all in one volume, but the incredibly bad editing is unforgivable -- Clarke deserves better."
4,Great Archival Collection,"This is one of the best single-author collections that I've ever read, and it's great for the Clarke fan. I particularly enjoyed the ""White Hart"" stories, some of Clarke's earliest works, taking place in a pub and told by engineers and scientists coming in for a pint. The collection in which they were published, Tales From the White Hart, is fairly hard to find.If there are any problems with it, though, this is it: it's printed on fairly ratty paper and lacks that, I don't know, immutable heft or something. Although the state of the proofreading isn't as bad as is sometimes said, it does contain a few more errors per hundred pages than are usually found.In conclusion, this is great. I heartily recommend it."
1,TOUCHA TOUCHA TOUCH herself,"YIKES! Terrible editing, monotone acting, awful lighting, holes in the plot, and the music is way louder then voices. Just call your local HS theatre kids and ask them to write, cast, film, and edit their best soft porn movie with $0 in three hours. It more then likely will be bettter then this. I was forced to give it one star. Only watched it because I found out someone I knew was in it. LOL"
4,Superviallian strikes again...,"As a big fan of KMD and Zeb Love X, I can't believe it took me so long to check out MF Doom, but I love the""bad"" guy persona like super villians cartoon. It's great to have a fresh approach instead half the rappers that all sound the same...In this album the supervillian (aka metal fingers) takes on the persona of Vic Vaughn, which is another twist.."
5,Doomsday part two,"Vaudeville Villain is a great followup to 'Operation Doomsday'.Mf Doom, as versatile as he is (which is proved in Madvillain or King Geedorah) , returns as a focused MC (most tracks are not produced by doom)who builts up storylines and vision to make you laugh,smile and giggle.Compare Doom to Kool Keith only with flow.A metalfaced masterpiece!"
2,Song bird,The sound quality is not good and two songs on disk 4 don't play. The picture on the box cover appears to have been cut out with scissors and glued to the box. Does not look original.
2,Older model seems to be better.,"I bought this to replace my older model Melitta one:one, which I've used happily for two years. Lucky I didn't get rid of it yet because I may go back to using that one. The wider spout on this model doesn't go down far enough and causes too much splashing, although I haven't tried using it to fill two cups yet.Also, for some reason my coffee tastes burnt. I'm using the same pods I've always used so I think maybe the temperature is too hot on this brewer. Overall, I like my older Melitta better."
5,Excellent Scout Knife,My son hardly put this down after getting it for his 11th birthday--just in time to start using it in boyscouts. He loves it. It's durable and well designed. Should serve him well.
4,Good choice for my boy,My son is not in boy scouts but recently started asking for a pocket knife. Well I ordered this one and so far so good. Some of the attachments are a little harder to pull-out than others but for what we wanted it works. I'm having to instruct him on knife safety etc. but this is a good start for a first time pocket knife. He thinks all the little additionals will come in handy.
1,Missing Footage,"I have been waiting and waiting for this release. My excitement at seeing this finally for sale was that of a 5-year old when the first streaks of dawn hit the window pains on Christmas morning. As soon as I saw this was by Warner Brothers, my excitement dwindled to despair. And yes, in checking IMDB, this miniseries is missing 10 minutes of footage.How can it be that movies are being released and there is no note that they are not complete? Shouldn't this be (dare I say it) ILLEGAL. Why does Warner Brothers keep doing this to beloved miniseries that we wait and wait for? The prices are set high enought that they shouldn't have to scrimp. Does everyone realize that the cost is less than $1 per DVD?How is is that the UK can receive complete discs but we can't in the US? It just doesn't seem right."
4,Napoleon and Josephine,Armand Assante played this role very well. Anything with Napoleon and Josephine I love. It is a true romantic story. I loved the movie and the story was alright. It is true love between the both of them that has lasted in history since their deaths.
5,Great product,"I've suffered from uti's in the past and someone recommended cleartract to me so I gave it a try. I've been using it for quite some time now and it really works, I haven't had a uti since I started using it. Very happy with product."
3,Might work for others,"I frequently get UTIs for the same reasons every woman does. I purchased this to attempt to ward off one just to see. While I'll still give this product another try, it actually exacerbated the UTI I attempted to treat it with. I had been taking cranberry supplements and drinking cranberry juice and my symptoms were lessening by day 3. I popped three of them like the dosage recommended and woke up the next day with the worst symptoms I'd ever experienced! I wonder if this sugar actually gave the bacteria something to ""munch"" on since they weren't all gone. It's probably very effective for preventing one, but not so much once you have one. Guess it's back to the doctor for more antibiotics."
1,false advertisment,the bottle shown is not what you receive. I paid 25.00 for this shampoo thinking i was getting a great deal because of the super size bottle. I could have gotten the shampoo for 19.00 for the size they sent me. Shame on you. I didn't see any thing about 33oz. on the ad when I ordered.
4,"If your a lefty, your in luck","Great for all the same things a right handed spoon would be used for, but designed for the 'lefty'. I bought it to roast coffee beans, as the holes allow you to move the beans just enough to get an even roast. Not the standard looking kitchen tool, but it is nice to hold a wooden spoon with a perfect grip.....for a change. Only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is because of the packaging. It comes needlessly wrapped in a fancy bag, adding to the cost, I guess. But, if you are buying this as a gift for your left handed friend, definitely 5 stars."
4,Good swimsuit for the price,"Got this swimsuit on deal of the day sale, so I can't complain about it. I have a longer torso, so this isn't the best suit for me. Thought with the halter that I might be able to adjust some slack in it, but it is still a little short. Wish it had a lining to it, or a thicker material, so it would be a little more flattering when wet (material of this shows your tummy flaws ladies!). Overall, this is a decent suit to lounge out in the sun, but maybe not so much for the pool."
4,Very complete and informative but a bit dry.,"Wow, this is the first review I've written that I'm almost certain will never be read - but just in case, I would like to recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of medicine. The text reads just a bit dated and very positivist, this is still an excellent resource on all aspects of the history of medicine.Guthrie follows the trends and institutions that sustained medicine throughout history rather than following the typical biographical format. The chapters on Islamic medicine, military medicine and tropic diseases were especially interesting since these topics are generally given little space in other works.This book is ideal for someone looking to deepen a knowledge of medical history or for a very dedicated newcomer to the topic. For more general introductions to the history of medicine, I'd recommend Sherwin Nuland'sDoctors: The Biography of Medicineor F. Gonzalez-Crussi'sA Short History of Medicine (Modern Library Chronicles)."
2,"Not really all that great, this one.","If you liked Vicious Circle or managed to find a copy of Make It Stop, you won't like this. Yes, 3/4 of the VC line-up plays on it, but it's too of the time (early 1990s) and it really doesn't sound like the Zero Boys you know and love. It's out of print, and for a good reason. it's too experimental, so if you're expecting Paul Z and the rest of the band covering Lisa Germano, you might enjoy it. Me, I wanted ""Civilization's Dying II"" and didn't get it. I love the band, but this album was a misstep they've recovered from judging from recent shows. Still, if you're a completist, check it out.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
5,"great knife for hiking, small survival kit","I wanted a small, quality knife that also had a saw, and this turned out to be perfect. It takes a razor edge, the saw is decent size, and the whole thing will fit lengthwise in an Altoids can, making it perfect for a small survival kit. It's a quality knife over all, the alox ribbed handle is durable, and there are a number of useful tools for a relatively small package. I wish the blade were lockback, but that's my only complaint."
3,"a useful resource for applique, embroidery, or even beadwork","while this book is not as fabulous as the author's first, _quilitng patterns from native american designs_, it is a wide-ranging group of line drawings based on the beadwork of many north, central and south american tribes.this isn't a picture or pattern book, it is a design resource for the quilter who wants to produce something out-of-the-ordinary--combining the designs in this book with those in the first would result in beautiful, unusual quilts.the designs could also be embroidered, extending the usefulness of the book."
5,Still Making House Calls,"With the aneroid sphygmomanometer, you can rest assure your blood pressure reading is accurate as the primary care physician's clinic. The quality is excellent, built to last and will long outlast all the battery operated self inflating home machines out there. When word gets out you own one, you will be out there, like me, still making house calls for family and friends."
3,"Accurate, hard to use",The unit is moderately priced and seems to be accurate in measuring blood pressure. The only difficulty is in putting it on----very difficult to do for one person. Other units I have used had a metal loop that would keep the cuff stabilized while securing it with the velcro. This one requires two hands to put the cuff on securely.
2,sphygmomanameter,"This may be an adult sphygmomanometer, but it is for a small person. This does not fit my husband, for which it was bought for. He needs a large. This does us no good."
5,its a very good product,I am really satisfied with your product and I hope you will continue to sell the products which will satisfy all the customers.
2,Will NOT work with Macintosh OS X and headset,"THE GOOD:I was able to easily connect my Palm Tungsten E2 & Sony Ericsson T637 to my various Macintosh computers. So, for roughly $10 (after rebate) I really can't complain too much about this adapter.THE BAD:However, I was NOT able to make a connection with any of my bluetooth headsets which was the main reason for buying this device. The bluetooth system preference (OS X 10.4.4) was able to recognize the headsets and even get the manufacturer and model numbers, but would then say that the bluetooth hardware would not support headsets. If anyone knows of a work-around for this I would LOVE to hear about it. Otherwise it looks like I am going to have to pony up for the D-Link adapter if I want to use my extra bluetooth headset to use with Skype."
2,Terrible,"I mean i got it to work somehow but definitely NOT satisfied. it is not Windows digitally signed so it gives you problems. For example when the device is plugged i can't use my usb keyboard. i have to unplug it (not only shut off, it has to be physically disconnected)...i emailed the tech support about it and unless they solve the problem by tomorrow, i am returning it and getting a windows compatible one. i mean it works with windows (i have XP pro SP2) but not good... spent the entire day with this problems...pay $15 more and get a good one!!! i hope tech support will solve it but i doubt it cuz i think if they could they would have done it already..."
1,This adapter sucks!,"To put it mildly, this highly unstable product caused too much aggravation. I'm using XP, SP2, on a Toshiba laptop, M45-S331. First of all, the CD-ROM instruction manual doesn't tell you that the device manager window will pop up continuously while the software is installing. It also doesn't indicate that the Found New Hardware Wizard will come on. Finally, it won't connect/pair the device properly. Never could get my bluetooth mouse to work. I'm returning this immediately. Do not buy this product!"
5,Does what it's supposed to do.,"I'm afraid this is going to be an incredibly dull review; what makes a review interesting are the odd problems, idiosyncrasies, and difficulties you experience with a product.The TrendNet USB adapter doesn't have any.I bought this for my G3 iBook, to sync my Address Book with my cell phone. I plugged it in, and it worked. No drivers to install. No software CD to load. You just plug it in, run the Bluetooth setup wiz, and You've Got Bluetooth.In fact, it was more reliable than the built-in Bluetooth in my iBook G4, which, until the most recent OS 10.4.7 patch, would randomly disappear and require a reboot.What more could you ask for?"
3,Helpful Guide to Pre-Columbian Voyages but a bit over the top,"I got this book because I am interested in what the scant records can tell us about possible voyages from Europe to the American continents before 1492. The book is useful in summarizing some of the mythical and legendary background as well as possible Scandinavian voyages. However Holand is a staunch supporter of the authenticity of the alleged rune stone finds in Minnesota, which have been debunked as a hoax---however cleverly and elaborately concocted. It is interesting though to examine the considerable efforts of true believers to patch together some kind of archaeological verification. Ultimately, I have to side with the doubters. Too much of Holand's alleged substantiation is shaky and has since been picked apart."
2,Natural Continents not worth the $$$,"I was really disappointed in this necklace when I opened it. I ordered the ""natural continents"" version. The continents are obviously computer printed stickers that are stuck onto the marble. You could see all the pixels, and even see wrinkles where the sticker had overlapped. There was a big gob of glue on the top where the chain had been glued on. I had expected the chain to be a little heavier and of better quality. Instead it felt like one of those light fake childrens necklaces you buy out of the quarter machines. I cannot speak for the gold continent version of this necklace, but the natural continents are definately not worth the money, however, a portion of the proceeds do go towards environmental foundations and the marble is made from recycled glass."
2,BORING!,"This book is written in a non-entertaining, clinical format (reads like a medical journal). Wasn't the heartwarming, feel-good book I thought it would be. Also has a lot of repetition, after the first few chapters, you've basically read the whole book..."
3,When the obvious is scientifically proven.,"Dr Sheldrake proves what we've always known, that animals use a mechanism of communication from any distance that does not involve sight or sound. His anecdotal descriptions are fun and how the suppositions are proven scientifically are fascinating. I have now ordered his other book on the sense of being stared at and am looking forward to broadening my interest in this, to animals, obvious ability."
5,Excellent Book!,"Very insightful and having experienced the innate intelligence and behaviors of dogs, it is well worth reading!"
2,Short and easy to read primer,"This is a nice, short, easy-to-read primer on Contracts from an expert in the field. Not too technical and written for law students or for someone interested in Contract law alone."
5,Hilaroiusly funny,"A must-read for any Scandinavian, wanting to know what others think about them. I had quite a number of belly-laughs readign this one!"
1,you've got to be kidding,"I watched this movie and didn't much like it. Based on the reviews here, I watched it again. I'm Japanese and proud of it, but I've got to say this is just not a good movie. It's not as good as the Matrix (sci fi); nor is it as good as Shrek (animation). It is for anime geeks, which until I saw this movie, I thought I might be one. But for you anime geeks, can you honestly tell us this movie -- which most claim to be the standard in anime -- has better animation than the Incredibles? better effects than Spiderman 2? better story line than Terminator? Not even close. With all due respect to the work put into this film, the animation is reminiscent of the Speed Racer cartoon, and it makes the ""adult plot"" hard to appreciate."
3,"its okay, but no AKIRA","this was an okay anime flick. i'm a huge anime fan so of coarse i had to see this. its got an intresting plot but not enough emotion from the characters. plus it could use a bit more faster moving scenes. the whole dark future city thing looks allot like AKIRA does. if your an anime fan go and take a stab at this movie but if your not and anime fan, dont even bother watching it. you'll just be lost."
4,Great to add to your collection,"Animation and sound quality is really good, one of the best and most detailed I have ever seen. It can hold its own with ""Akira"". Plot and story is alright, makes you ponder a little. If you don't get it at first, you can always watch it again. I am giving this 4 stars, coz the ""nudity"" in certain action scenes seemed out of place to me. I mean, do you fight a battle with armor/camoflage or totally without any clothes? Buy this, its really good to add to your collection. Definitely not for kids of all ages."
5,"Amazingly, a thoughtful action flick","This anime adaptation of Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell manga is somewhat slow for the genre, but it gives a look into man's drive for new knowledge and technology and the possibility of synthetic intelligence. This movie hooked me into Anime. END"
2,"Over-hyped, over-rated.","It tries to be too profound and complex, really. The art and animation are definitely sophisticated though. I liked the way they merged cel animation with computer graphics to give the visuals a realistic look and feel. Still, I've seen a lot of better anime."
5,Awsome,If you haven't seen any Ghost in the Shell material watch this movie before anything. It was very good.
2,Ghost In The Shell,"I bought this movie expecting awesome animation, great action scenes, and the coolness of anime characters. This was a major letdown. The plot is interesting, but the horrendous English dubbing spoiled the movie for me."
4,confusing sometimes but good,"I pick out this movie because i wanted to have a good anime movie, but i didnt know what to buy so i pick up one at random. The first time I saw this movie I didnt understand a few things(like what a ""ghost"" was). But then i checked out the definitions of everthing that they mention in the movie from the DVD extras. Then i figured out that a ghost is suppose to be the thing that makes you human no madder what.So the movie is kind of confusing if your not smart(which im not)but other than that the movie is a good one. The animation is one of the best I have ever seen. I especialy like how the blood squirts all over the place when someone gets shot and how when someone shoots a gun whatever the bullets hit it makes craters in it and the object just gets blown away.This is definitly the movie to buy if your looking for a good anime movie and i think this is one you will watch over and over again."
4,One of my favorite movies,"Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite movies. Whether anime or not. The plot is rich and complex, the action rather intense, etc. Some people might be offended by the occasional nudity, just as some people might not like the 'deepness' of the plot. To each his own. This one makes you think. Unlike many movies, whether anime or not."
4,"Candy for the eyes, ears, and brain.","Just watched the video and am now buying the DVD.Not for the intellectually challenged who *only* want to see things blown up.In the next few decades there will be revolutionary advances in the sciences of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. This film is about the new form some of humankind's oldest and most significant questions will take as a result of these technologies. What is thought? What is consciousness? What defines an individual? Is it memory? What if those memories are altered? Can consciousness exist in or arise in a non-biological entity? Should the rights currently only granted to humans be extended to all sentient beings? Can any person ever know for sure if anyone else is conscious?This movie is right on target for the year 2029.Shades of Blade Runner and The Matrix."
2,Mildly Interesting.,"A few memorable scenes, lots of dialog that tries to examine some deep subjects but fails. Not miserably, but fails. Had I seen this when it came out, it might have had a bigger impact on me, but the characters were wooden and the ending unsatisfying.If a human could have an artificial heart and still be human, what if the whole human was artificial? When is someone no longer human and does it matter anyway? Mildly interesting story that can stand on its own, it just doesn't stand very tall.Unfortunately, reviewers on Amazon give out 5 star ratings like they are candy for dying kids. Every teenager (mental or otherwise) rushes off to plug their latest fad. At least I liked it well enough to finish it..."
3,Too much ghost drama in one shell.,"Ghost in the shell was a good movie however it was kind of a disapointment.It seemed like the guys who made the movie tried to put in too much of ""the meaning of life"" and ""do i have a soul?"" drama in too little of a film.The movie had a couple okay action scenes and a cool plot and the story had a style similiar to sci-fi/cyberpunk authors like william gibson and neil stephenson.Id say the only reasdon i gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is because the main character was so cool and just kicked so much rear.She was alot like Max from the series Dark Angel.Overall this is the kind of anime where you rent it once and dont have much ambition to watch it again(in my opinion that is.)"
4,Loved the extra features,"First of all I just want to say if you have a surround sound system, this is one of the movies to watch it on. It has all of the action that will catch you from the very begining and the sound too keep you hostage. The Bonus featues is just icing on the cake to show all of the great work to but this great movie together."
2,"Great animation, story lacking","The animation is great, some of the best I've ever seen. Fluent movement. The plot, however, came together towards the end and in the beginning was not understandable. The anime was a dissapointment compared to the manga by my favorite artist Masamune Shirow. I suggest the manga. I don't see where the anime ties in."
4,Wonderful,"Fantastic cyberpunk anime. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I read the manga, which is much more complex. But for approximately 90 minutes, this is a wonderful movie."
3,"Love Sci-Fi, but this is difficult to follow... Dissapointed","As a major sci-fi lover, I found this to be a dissapointment after all the rave reviews. I was debating whether to give this 2 or 3 stars, and ended up with 3 only because the Audio and Video quality was very good. The plot is difficult to follow and I can hang with even the best technobabble filled plots. In this case, the conmstant meaningless technobabble and plot were hard to follow leading to a poor experience. It was if way too much of the movie was an 'inside joke' type of experience. I did not gain anything pleasurable or meaningful from this 'Anime'. Unless you are a proven Anime fan, I'd rent this DVD (at best). Usually I am very enthusiatic when it comes to anything sci-fi, but this did nothing for me."
3,Ghost in the Shell,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but I was still skeptical because I had no idea what to expect, so I rented it. Most people said it was good and hard to understand so you had to watch it at least 3 times to fully get it. I disagree it was a fairly decent movie (I'm kind of glad I didn't buy it) but it's not all that great (it's okay), plus I understood exactly what was going on the first time. I would suggest renting this movie before buying it because you might love it and you might hate it. But what's really cool about this movie is that you can see that The Matrix got a lot of ideas out of it. But anyway, I suggest renting it."
5,When CGI and Philosophy Merge,"Ghost in the Shell is groundbreaking in its seamless use of CGI; this combined with its extreme visual detail makes for an impressive film, especially when seen on a large screen. Based upon the manga (Japanese comic) by Masamune Shirow, the main character, Major Kusinagi, is a government agent tracking the ellusive Puppet Master, who ghost-hacks cyborgs in 2029 A.D. and has them commit his crimes. The ubiquitous nature of technology melds with the technophobic aspects of life in the future as deep philosophical questions asked by Humans since the beginning of time are treated in a novel manner via these ""given"" SF characters.Note that the subtitled version is FAR superior to the dubbed version."
3,The World of the late fifties Religions,"This is not a bad overview of some of the World's religions, but the reader should take care. Although I originally considered the book as a text for a survey course I am teaching on the subject, after reading some of the selections more closely, I was unsure that the book would work. It is well-written and interesting to read, to be sure, but smacks of a certain condescension or has a patronizing tone that came off as a little biased. I might still use the text to demonstrate a point of view, but have concerns that some of the students in the class whose own traditions were discussed by the author might take exception at how he portrays or writes about them. The book is a product of its time -- pre civil rights, pre feminist, pre alot of things. Yet, like a number of sort of ""classics"", it has its merits."
5,Great book,This is a great synopsis of world religions. Widely accepted by many educated as one of the finest works of its kind.
3,i can consider,i go used one and it was ok from outlook but i got the oldest edition of 1990 so i have problem with that but other things are good..
5,Focused on Meaning,"As a religion scholar, this is one of the best introductions to the field of human faith that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Dr. Smith writes with enthusiasm and concentrates his exploration on the essence of each partiular tradition. While he does not include every holy day, festival, law, etc., of the particular religions he does communicate that which is far more important: the meaning as a whole, the spirit embodied within each path."
5,Thr Worlds Religions:,An excellent overview that promotes greater understanding of the worlds divergent religions.A good investment of time.
3,A Good Start,"This text gives a good overview of many of the World's major religions. If you don't really know what you're interested in, this is a good place to start. Its doesn't give as much detail as I would like, but you can only fit so much into one book!"
4,good overview,"_The World's Religions_ (published in its first editions as _The Religions of Man_) makes good reading for those of us who want to know a little bit about a lot of faiths. There is something here about just about every organized spiritual tradition I could think of, plus many that were new to me.Smith explains each religion with a clear, nonjudgmental style. His aim is to give a broad survey, rather than defend a thesis. Beginning readers of comparative religion will find this book a great introduction and an invaluable resource."
1,I fotgot to mentuon.,\do you know how dumb is A.C.? One of their song titles are everyone in A.C. is dumb. Yep thatz right.
1,Disgrace to grind in generall...,"...And music too. I can't stand ac's music because its just horrible and to think people that love grind could enjoy this crap is beyond me. Its sad tho cause there is so much other better bands out there... Examples ? Prosthetic cu nt,gorelord,deadfordays,anally raped by satan,entorturement,cripple basterd,,bound & gagged, and do make sure you check out ""deadfordays"" drummer he is unhuman. Now that you guys know good grind bands ? Don't look under ac but do over look them! Those other bands make ac look like nsync...Trust me. Keep it undeground and unknownnn!!!"
5,A Demented Masterpiece,"I love AxCx. Seth Putnam has the balls to say what's on his mind and fight anyone who messed with him! Don't listen to the easily offended idiots that hate AxCx. AxCx are SUPPOSED to offend, and Seth doesn't give a rat's ass about what you think! They probably listen to MTV crap. **coughcoughcough**C.Conrad**coughcoughcough** Oops!I guess I named someone while I was coughing!He likes Coldplay and Fall Out Boy, need I say more? AxCx are way better than those fags combined! To improvise one of their songs...COLDPLAY SUCKS, COLDPLAY SUCKS, COLDPLAY SUCKS, AND FALL OUT BOY SUCKS TOOMetalheads are calling you C.Conrad, and they're calling you gay.For the easily offended, steer clear. For everyone else, buy!"
2,Astronaut Costume: Boy's Size 12-14,"The material is fine for indoor use. The teeth of the zipper, however, came apart the first time the suit was zipped, and continues to do the same. Unfortunately, the plastic wrapping the suit came in was discarded, so I can not return it for exchange. At this point, the suit is useless."
3,"Nice, but no helmet and pricey","I bought this because my son wanted to be an astronaut for halloween, and this looked like it would fit over warm underclothes as we live in a colder climate where it is not unexpected to go trick or treating in the first snow of the season. I was extremely disappointed when the costume showed up and there was no helmet included like in the picture advertizing this costume. I misunderstood the ""official NASA cap"" as the helmet being included because that is what the picture shows. I believe I would NOT have purchased this outfit knowing this prior to purchase because $50 to me is way more than I wanted to spend anyway. I thought of the convenience of getting the entire outfit in one purchase so that is how I justified it in my head. It does fit over warmer clothes, and if that were not the case, I would definitely be returning it. As of now, I am just chalking this up to my gullibility to thinking a picture of the product includes everything in it."
2,Disappointed.,The basket did not come with Velcro fasteners. I gave it to a charitable organization and bought one locally.
1,Little help for login scripts,Everyone of these script examples start out with the ADsPath of the object to be queried or changed. No mention that I can find of how to come up with the ADsPath in the first place.Thanks for nothing MS!
1,"FRAUD , DONT EVEN BOTHER !",I ordered two bottles of from Jacob Karczag . The first ran out in ( it was not full ) a month and upon opening the second IT WAS TOTALLY EMPTY. Don't even bother buying from this crook. The rating is for this fraud and not for the product. Avoid this seller.
4,Works Well,"Wasn't sure if this would harm other clothes in my washer but so far it has worked well. I have used it 4 or 5 times and it works just fine. Hoping this one will hold up better than my last one I bought at an Hanes, Bali, etc outlet."
5,"Love, Love this movie...","This movie was soooo funny. If you are a fan of Bette Midler, this one you must see. It will have you laughing until you can't laugh anymore. This movie along with Ruthless People. A rainy day, some baked cookies, and a nice blanket. Yessss!"
5,Beyond MSF,"Beyond MSF courses, there's nothing much available but track school or 'Twist of the Wrist""... nice to see something advanced focused on street sport riding."
1,"Ditziness, Dough and Dithering","If you like a book where the heroine spends 98% of the book dithering, running away and being totally illogical this one is for you! It wasn't for me!"
1,Boring...certainly not a page turner I,"This was a book club selection. Out of the seven discussing the book, two somewhat liked the book, one didn't finish it and three didn't like it at all."
1,"plodding & boring, full of irrelevant details","I gave up at page 284. A decent writer could have set the scene, introduced the characters and told everything important that happened so far in about ummm... say four pages. Life is too short for such waste of time."
3,"Gets boged down, by page #'s","This is not a bad book for what it was, but it suffers from a typical flaw of this author--too long. Also I found the plot to resemble almost an Acid Trip with no liniear set pattern that I could figure out.When I brought this book I was under the impression that it would be a rousing adventure tale about heroes trapped in a VR universe. Ok, i'm sure it is however I slugged by way through up to page 300 and nothing of any consequence had happened as yet. Now I became a Tad Willams fan after reading his Merrory, Sorrow, Torn trilogy and while those book were just as long at least they kept you interested.Overall-I'm sure it would have been good had I stuck with it, however I just didn't have the time, so if you want a book you can really be interested in don't buy this book."
4,Intriguing & Desultary,"I picked this book up because I enjoyed Tad Williams fantasy books (the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series). That was another weighty four-volume series but moved along at a better pace.The concept and the premise of the book pulled me in. The characters are interesting and there are some philosophical questions that arise in the book that are thought-provoking. The book succeeds in raising these issues and remaining entertaining at the same time. If you are interested in Sci-Fi, Virtual Reality, and the nature of man's existence, I would recommend the book to you.However, I had a hard time moving through this book and the next (just started the third). I normally read at 60-100 pages per hour depending on the writer, but I found I went much slower with this book. The plot is intricate enough that you need to keep it fresh to follow along. If you are a slow reader, I might suggest you pass on this one until you have significant amounts of time."
2,Rip-off,"Does every author think they are Tolkien? No way does this story deserve 2500 pages. ""Lengthy"" and ""epic"" are not synonyms. ""Trilogy"" refers to three self contained stories, NOT one book just cut up into three volumes. Even George Lucas understood that! I have about had it with authors who turn one idea into a career instead of being creative. I will not buy Mr. Williams works again."
4,wonderful,"Great book! This book starts out a little shakey. I was a bit confused at first about this ""Paul Jonas"" guy, but I think that's what I was supposed to be. It all pulls together very nicely at the end as this first book closes off. And the next three books are all 5/5 as far as I'm concerned.This series is the best of Tad Williams."
4,Bloody good book!,"Yeah, it was a good one. The story was so wonderfully complicated and intricate that I did find it, excuse the tremendously overused cliche, literally hard to put down and I'm looking forward to its sequels. Do yourself a favor, BUY THIS BOOK! Its set on Earth in the near future but don't worry, that doesn't mean its another ""America saves the world plot"". In fact, far from it. Much of the story is set in South Africa with only a couple of major characters living in the US. And, good news if your a proud Aussie like myself, some of it is even set in our wonderful Sydney and one of the book's most interesting characters lives there. In short, Otherland is another excellent novel from the genius behind Memory, Sorrow and Thorn. Its plot is brillianty complex and spans the globe with a diverse set of believable and most importantly likeable [and hateable] characters.So, read the book and next time any of you see Tad say G'day for me. Bye."
2,A deceptive ending,"I was furious to discover that this was only the first of a series of books. While at times it was entertaining, at others it was ridiculous. Some of the story threads were so disjointed and convoluted that it was difficult to keep them straight during the several weeks that it took me to slog my way through it. Many of the storylines were imaginative and creative, however I can't get out of my mouth the bad taste created when I got to the last page only to discover that it was ""to be continued"". What a cheap marketing tool. At least be honest and put on the front cover that it is the first book in an ongoing series. I will not buy the sequel!"
