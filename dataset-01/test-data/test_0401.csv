3,needed for class,This book was useful in class and an easy read. It was easy to understand. I still keep it on-hand in my own classroom now for reference.
3,"solid case, but odd closure","The case is solid and looks good w/o being one of those big, leather affairs from the 80s.The closure is odd, dual zippers that don't meet, a rubber ""seal"" at the top. Why did Sony do this?"
4,The case travels well,"I am reviewing this camera case after several years of ownership. The case has protected my camera through a lot of adventures. I have a Harley and this case has gone through close to 50,000 miles riding in the saddlebags and photographing my travels. It is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to someone who likes to keep their camera with them but can't always guarantee it will not get bumped around a little on the road of life."
1,"Buy it to support the cause, but not to listen to.","I bought this CD because I support Greg Mortensen's cause, after reading Three Cups of Tea. This CD is nowhere near as compelling as the book. It's amateurish at best.I have no regrets over buying it, but one listen is enough."
4,Essential Charlemagne,"Rather than a linear narrative, this book is more of a thematic analysis of Charlemagne and his times. Chapters correspond to different subjects, such as military (administration, recruitment, army size...), church (church-state relations, the deep integration between the 2 spheres), economy, and so on. The first few chapters function as a brief narrative history, although within the thematic arrangement, the author skips about considerably. Each topic is intended to buttress Barbero's convincing argument that Charlemagne's rule was fundamental to all of European history that followed. Unlike Ozymandias disappearing into the depths of history, Charlemagne's works endure to this day.The book is well-written and well-researched. Within the second or third chapters, either the translation or the original wording was awkward, but it did not affect the overall conveyance of the subject matter."
4,perfect gift,If you love silver then you should love these earrings. The texture gives them an exotic effect. The earrings were smaller than I expected but my daughter still loves them and wears them often.
5,A Good Primer,Our current educational system is absolutely rampant with revisionist history. This gives a great overview of the history of the Catholic Church; an ACCURATE history. Definitely a perfect place to start one's journey of discovering historical Truth.
5,Worth A Try,"See your doctor first. This is an easy to read book, with real practical suggestions. It will not work for everyone, but it is surely worth a try. In fact, I lost weight (that's good) on this diet by eliminating all of the junk carbs from my diet. Turns out I do not have IBD/IBS, but this diet can do no harm, and it may do you some good."
2,common sense,I kept hearing about this SCD diet and how wonderful it is. This is common sense to figure out what foods bother you . All it does is cut out ALL foods and slowly introduces foods one by one . Well I don't need a book to tell me that.
4,Very Well Written...,"Very informative and an invaluable resource in your journey for healing. It takes discipline to eat this way but let's face it some of us are already on a restrictive diet by nature of what we must avoid. So this wonderful book opens the way for finding joy and delight in your food again. Not to mention feeling soooooo much better. There are a number of cookbooks on the market that are great companions to this one. Just look for the ""SCD""... Give it a try I don't believe you will regret it."
4,Thank You,"Wanted to read and try the recipes.Have issues with SIBO, on antibiotic therapy, and yogurt.Diet in book has been very helpful and I am having fun tryingout the recipes in the back.TYVM : )"
5,Proven naturally healthy diet.,"I was introduced to this diet 7 years ago. Began the diet with my physicians knowledge and was able to go prescription drug free within a year. The diet really works and the book not only gives the how to and recipes, it gives the scientific information to back up the evidence. I highly recommend this book/guide to all that suffer from intestinal disorders."
5,Have Questions? Need Support? Join the SCD Listserv!,"There's a very active listserv (e-mail support group) for followers of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (""Breaking the Vicious Cycle""). Feel free to join, meet other SCDers, share support, get your questions answered, and swap recipes.

3,Poor Binding,The book is full of good content but I literally came apart at the binding on the first day of reading.
2,The Battle for Digestive Amnesia,Breaking the Vicious cycle is probably a book that will assist the person suffering from chronic diarrhea but not a book suffering from chronic constipation. It may be possible that the dietary recommendations could assist both conditions but I have found it not so in that each person presents complex individuality. A more helpful book for me is Deepak Chopra's book: Perfect Digestion... the key to balanced living (ISBN 0-517-79975-8 1995 Harmony Books).
3,Good but tough,This book does offer you an alternative to what most doctors won't suggest i.e. a diet rather than buckets of medication. I would say that this book is necessary if you are going to start the SCDiet.If the question you wanted answered is how good the SCDiet is? I can't answer that yet. It is an incredibly restrictive diet that takes a lot of committment. I want to see what else I can do before I have to go down the SCDiet road.T
4,Great Value / Solid Reputation !,"Just received this Trimmer, never used one before and was excited to use it ...... Built well and looks sleek and innovative ! Price paid was simply a deal ....... Seems to work okay, the rotary blade tip seems small to me, takes a while to cut ? Maybe it is me, but it is worth giving this a try ....."
2,D. Harris,"The trimmer wouldn't run untill I sharply banged on my counter top. Then when I used it,it felt like is was ripping the hair out instead of cutting it.It was painfull. Fine ear hair is no problem. Coarse nose hair get ready for some pain!"
3,The book is for kids with a great imagination,Hi!I hope you read A Wrinkle In Time... Only if you have a great Imagination though! I thought the book was for little kids....like kids in 4th or 5th grade.
4,Getting over the Old Testament,"All my good intentions of getting through the reading of the Bible are being met. It has been my intent for years to have a reference of the history of the Old Testament with the ""begats"" being a stumbling block. But I am doing it and have a better understanding of it's importance. Thank you!"
1,Get Free Software,"This could have been done much better! This is simply a Bible divided into sections by adding numbering to the top of the pages. Some readings even end mid verse. Here is a link to a free software program that will allow you to create your own Bible reading schedule. You can choose which books of the Bible to read or include the entire Bible. You also choose which days of the week that you will read. And, you then choose a start and stop date. From this information, a personal reading plan is generated. It is very flexible, and I have used this, in the past, to create a 90 day read through the Bible plan. With this program, you choose how long you will take to read through the Bible. And the output has a very good verse balance! In other words, it will not cut you off mid verse, and you will be reading roughly the same amount of text each day. The plan can also be printed out. [...]."
3,good but disappointing,just another attempt to leave you hanging. I am the only one that thinks it shouldn't take three years to put the DVD out?
3,Not sure why they broke season 3 into 2 parts...,"It is still not clear to me why they broke season 3 into 2 parts...but I can tell you that the first part was AMAZING, and the second part was not up to par. I was thoroughly disappointed in the fact that there were only 8 episodes in this part, and it did not even come close to matching up with the previous seasons.Obviously, Entourage fans should buy and watch this episode, but you should buy it with the season 3 part 1, or the season 4 so that you do not end up feeling empty at the end of this short season."
4,i love me some elvis,"well let me just start by sayin i love elvis so this review is one sided. this is his trust album it's not his best in my opinion but i still think its good. i got a copy of this album on vinyl before i got the CD and i enjoyed it enough to buy the CD. with tracks like ""Clubland"", ""New Lace Sleeves"", ""From A Whisper To A Scream"" and my favorite off the album ""Shot With His Own Gun"" this album is worth the 10 bucks. the rest of the tracks are good to the range from a country sound on ""Different Finger"" to a rockabilly sound on ""Luxembourg"" and all the classic elvis sound that i love. over all its a good album. if you like elvis add this one to your collection."
4,Well built,"It has not cycled on yet, but when I compared this to the old Basement WD pump I had, this is far and away a better product. I have 3 pumps in my sump including this one, submersible, pedestal and Battery, so I had to create a shelf for the Wayne unit to rest on. Seems to be fine, and I hope it never has to get used."
1,Great customer service -- Lousy Unit,"Was upgraded to the ESP25 from the ESP15 when they ran out which was sweet.When I finally installed it, seemed to have trouble with the float switch.They took care of it and then some, fast and easy.Hope I never have to use the sump!ps. I got a deep cycle battery from solar-electric, they had good information on their site so I bought from them.UPDATE: Changing my review from 5 stars to 1.... I figured I would test this baby (I know I know, it's been a year) and nothing happened... tried two other float switches and tested the battery with a multimeter (seems fine).... one float switch appears to work -- it makes a sound as though the pump would turn on... IF the pump were working.I think this baby kicked on one time in the past year... that's lousy if the pump itself is broken... I'm going to carefully open up the control box and look around... the fuse looks OK. Glad I tested this grrrrrr."
2,Not impressed,"I'm a newbie to PHP and MySQL. I was hoping to find a good tutorial based book on the subject, but this was not it. I guess I should've known better than to get a Dummies book as these are really only reference books. However, this isn't even good for a reference. The examples are very short and do not explain what's going on very well. For example, table joins. This is the point I'm stuck on now, which is a very important part of using a database, yet the author glossed over it in less than two pages. Now I'm just frustrated because I'm in the middle of a web project and am left hanging. I should've listened to other reviewers and got PHP & MySQL Web Development. If you're a complete beginner as I am, skip this one or you'll be lost and frustrated."
2,Inaccessible,"One word: Boring! It's a great and important subject, but the author is so dry that his content is lost in his delivery. I've read more complex pieces written far more accessibly. What's worse is his conclusion, which seems like he just ran out of time and came up with a platitude. I would looking at some alternative authors."
2,angelo alright,"I read this book for the first time when I had been studying philosphy for about six months. at the time I liked it, with my limited knowledge of the subject. rereading it now Im not so sure. Ok, Scruton writes good, and has a lot of points to make, and I agree on many of them. What annoys me greatly, and not just about Scruton, but also with very many of the anglo-american philosophers are their understanding of so-called continental philosophy. His short account of Foucault in this book shows almost no understanding at all of Foucaults ideas. Its plain dumb, like many other ""anglo-american"" readings of ""continental"" philosophy. spare me the self-referentially inconsistent arguments...sorry the outburst but its way off the point that Foucault, Derrida and others are trying to make.To get back to the book, I still think its ok in many ways, but it needs to be read along with another book as counterpoint."
4,Great KU season footage,"This DVD is a must for any KU fan. It is great season highlights, clips of great KU shots, interviews, behind the scenes. What it doesn't have is the complete KU/ North Carolina Semi Final game. For this game it only has some highlights."
2,OK.,"I was looking for a copy of the entire final game. Although I knew up front this was not the whole game I was a bit disappointed in the video. It lacked and did not convey the magic any excitement of that final. It is not a bad video, but not something I've watched more than once."
2,Not what i expected...,"I bought this CD in hopes that it would have the radio/video version of ""Love at First Sight"", but it doesn't. I already have ""Fever,"" and it's the same one that's on the album. I don't really like that version, the new one just has more to it, and is a bit dancier. However, ""Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head"" is pretty good...interesting, to say the least."
3,"The ""Week of Dinners"" is overstated","These recipes are interesting, and managing food this way would allow leftovers to ""morph"" well. However, each night is still a night of cooking--it isn't ""assemble and heat""--it's fully cooking each night, using a few reserved ingredients from the Sunday dinner. The Sunday dinner gives you a head start--but it doesn't really look as if it cuts down on the cooking every night."
3,Does the job,"Wish there were some slightly bigger holders for the tow truck and custom cars.The only drawback to the product is the edges and top corner roll inward. Maybe my son has too many cars, but with all the slots filled they weight pulls the sides inward.Nevertheless, the product does as it is suppose to and the edge rolling is very minor to grand scheme of things."
1,This book sucks. Don't buy it (honest),"Well all I can say, every now and then you get a bad apple in the bunch. If your a beginner to Delphi start with something *Lite*. Best book i've found so far is called ""Beginning Delphi 2.0: Instant Windows Programming, by Wrox publishing. But iterate once again- SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T PURCHASE ""Nathan Wallace's Delphi 3 Example Book...."" !!!"
1,"Poor, lacking in content, CD worthless","I bought this book on spec. More fool me. The CD contains *nothing* in the way of source code, apart from many projects comprising of one form, and one button - which links to a duff web-site.Do yourself a favour and skip this book."
2,The Author knows his stuff but the CD is trash.,Do not buy the book for the CD .. its not there and probably will not be there .. Under Construction! Worldware Publishing is no help .. You get the book and the CD as is .. the code does not run.
3,Where's the book?,"I (we) have been waiting for the publisher to release this book! What's the hold-up? Is this possibly the book that will answer all those little programming questions? Is this the one worth waiting for? Who knows! Well, maybe there is a better book available now! I think I'll continue to shop ...."
5,One of the BEST BLUES Concerts on BLUE RAY,"I have been listening to this concert in cd form for many years and I just love most of the songs. Buddy wittington is a GREAT Guitar player and show his Texas Stuff on this Blue Ray DVD. This concert, a long with Joe Cocker's German Live concert are 2 of my most favorite Live concerts. Many Memories....."
3,ENTERTAINING!,In the Company of My Sistahs Book Club members thought the book was entertaining. Some members didn't like the book at all. Thought it was an In between reading type of book. This author has written beter books
3,Time Killer,"Kinfolks was a good book,UNTIL, I reached the last chapter. There was not enough tension between the women who conceived these children and the man who help create them and then left them. At the end of the novel, everything seemed to be placed in a tight tiny package and 'the end'. That's it. No more. The emotional level could have been explored a little deeper. All in all, a quaint read."
1,I can't believe how bad this game is,I am a major fan of Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe. A predecessor to this game and I can't beleive they are in anyway related. This game is pure arcade. It has all of the realism of the old 1942 game for Nintendo. In fact it plays much like After Burner for Sega. This is definately a game that has been rushed out for the holiday season to trick people into thinking it is a true WW2 flight simulator which couldnt be farther from the truth.I was truly excited when I first read about this game coming out and agin unfortunately I have been let down.
4,NOT A SIM! IT'S AN ACTION GAME!,"HEY! All you SIM-Heads! This is not a sim. ""SWON is an air combat action game following in the tradition of the X-Wing and TIE Fighter and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe series. Like those titles,SWON is strongly focused on action.""- from the LucasArts Secret Weapons over Normandy official web site.If you're a heavy sim player, you probably will not like this GAME. I've seen a couple of poor reviews citing poor realism or flight dynamics. IT'S A GAME! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE REALISM! LucasArts focused on historic accuracy AND fun. If you like action games without bothersome ""flight models"" and reality (I turn reality off in CFS1,3 and other of my sims)then you may like this game.Hey sim-heads, lighten up."
2,Made In China,I don't know how Cuisnart can say these knives retail for $200.00.They looked and felt cheap. I returned them without using. I felt they were hyped beyond what they really were.
1,Not Recommended,"I have only had mine for just over 3 weeks, and already the nubs are falling out like crazy. They're all over the house. Very poor quality. Adidas has gone downhill."
2,Quality has gone downhill,"Very comfortable, feet love the massage from the nubs. Quality has gone south. The massaging nubs break off at an unreasonable rate. Be prepared to buy replacements often once you get addicted to these."
5,this game rocks.,"This game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It rocks! It is about Mr Burns buying the bus transit system and you have to earn 1,000,000,000 dollars to buy it back. It is almost like crazy taxi. Except waaay more violent. My friend thinks this game sucks because he is reeeeeeeeealllllly picky about video games. Buy this game!"
3,Reasonable shotgun cleaning box,"The exterior is nice looking with some blemishes. The drawer is a bit fragile and the interior tool style box is very fragile and the seperators do not stay all the way on the bottom to avoid parts shifting into other compartments. It is not a great box, but it does work and if you are not too rough with it, it appears as though it would function well over time. To get a high quality box, you are looking at four or five hundred dollars, so this really is quite a bargain. I have not seen anything in this price range as nice."
1,Terrible Service,"I bought this dvd recorder around a year-and-a-half ago. 8 months ago the device began to malfunction and so i sent it in to classic for a warranty repair. as it turns out the device is on back-order and they will no longer be making repairs or replacements. therefore i have been in lidigation with classic for the past 8 months and they have been less than helpfull. i citanly donot recomend buying this, or any other classic product."
3,After the Storm,"My first book by this author, but I'm not impressed. Usually I find I agree with a lot of the other reviewers but not this time. I find it very slow reading, I'm almost finished.I think the adults in this story had more problems than Wade. And the language they used around him was disgusting, not to mention the horror stories he was entertained with. The stuff that came out of Wade's mouth at age 10 should never have been dismissed.It's too bad alcohol is made so available in such a remote village. It just ruined those young teens."
1,"TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR...","""Girl You Know It's True"" was a magnificent album. The musicians who made it, made one of the greatest pop albums of the late 80s/early 90s. You're reading this because you would expect a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation to include those songs that you remember, namely ""Baby, Don't Forget My Number"" and ""Girl You Know It's True."" For some reason, this album has been marketed in the same fraudulent way that the music was. Specifically, the two above mentioned songs are ""remix"" versions on this album, and they naturally lose all of the magic of the original versions. They aren't even close to the originals. Now, having just received this CD in the mail, I will be sending it back. Save yourself the pain that I just went through, and just buy a used copy of ""Girl You Know It's True,"" as I realize that copies for it new are ridiculously high."
2,A Simple Recipe Journal,"This is a very bare bones way of organizing recipes; it is simply a lined journal with lines to organize the title/kitchen/serving amount of each recipe at the top of the page. There are no other sections (like appetizer, soups or entree) so if you are looking for a more thorough journal, this one is not for you. I love Ina Garten (the Barefoot Contessa) but wish that I had saved the $12 and used one of the spiral bound lined journals in my home (you can find cute ones for $3-6 at Target, TJ Maxx or any hobby store). I will continue to use this book, but it does live up to the price tag."
1,Weird...blah....dumb,i dont' like this book...it was so dumb...it gave me a headache...blah blah blah is all i saw when i read this book...i went to sleep with a headache because of this dumb book...why is this book so dumb? the author should really think about others and not to give them headaches...
5,"An involving, dramatic story of friendships and illness","Melinda dreams of being a great ballerina and her talents take her well on the way to her goals - until leukemia steps in. Now she's battling for her life, and her story appears here in the form of letters between 3 friends affected by her struggles. A Rose For Melinda is a strongly recommended as an involving, dramatic story of friendships and illness."
4,technical aspects of traditional hand drawn animation,"The Animation Book seems geared for professional animation students or the serious amateur, not the casual viewer of Saturday morning fare. The book explores many techniques such as flip books, cutouts, clay, drawing directly on film, and a host of ""experimental"" gadgets. However, the emphasis is on cel animation, and, in particular, the equipment required to produce it. I especially enjoyed Laybourne's suggestions for homemade animation stands, and inexpensive choices for cameras, editing equipment, and production planning. The author devotes almost no space to artistic concerns but there are plenty of other books for that. Much of the content of this book has been made obsolete by computer graphics which plays an ever-increasing role in the industry. However, if you would like to take a stab at making your own cartoons the old fashioned way, this book will provide much of the technical information you will need."
2,I think I missed something,"Although Ok to read,I didn't particularly connect, I think. I agree with another reader who said these men were not cowboys, just everyday losers. I think the women who say, gee, gee, whiz, I just can't get a man to commit, must take a look inward and see if it is herself lacking committment of some sort."
4,A collection of stories or a circular self-portrait?,"I liked this book, because of its realism. It is a painfully real portrayal of women who hurt themselves by being with men who treat them badly. I most liked the parts about her dogs, and about her girlfriend, better than the parts about the men, because I got tired of hearing about the same frustrating behaviors. However even in its repetitiveness it remained real, because it was like therapy. She had to keep telling herself the same story, to pound it into her head. In this way the end was satisfying, because she got herself out of the rut and got deeper, more creative, and the life-meanings fleshed out."
2,another opinion,"Although I can understand why this book is so popular, as it is well written, I found it depressing and somewhat disappointing. This book came highly recommended to me and promised to be an insightful and witty commentary about relationships between men and women. Each of the stories were well written and a smooth and interesting read, but I found that they were all very similar in tone and character. The women, I found, were portrayed universally as outdoorsy and physically strong, but emotionally wishy- washy and victimized. It just seemed to me to be a typical portrayal of women's weaknesses, but that is what the title says..."
4,Easy to read print,"This is a great Bible for those with trouble seeing well. It is a wonderful size print, and you can buy the Old Testament seperately."
2,Not that great but dog is good,Not to exciting. Dog does some great things in the film but has this dark quality. I would stick with Tim Conway in Carol Burnett Tv shows
4,I thought it was funny,"I thought this movie was funny especially with the way the economy is in the crapper. Ok so maybe it was a bit on the unrealistic side but who really cares. It wasn't so unrealistic that it took me out of the movie. I loved the friendship aspect of the show and I liked the ""happy ending"" aspect as well. The characters were funny and I like that it was a ""feel good"" movie. We need a few of those. It had a decent plot and none of the characters were overly annoying. Its not going to win any awards but who says every movie has to be a contender? Mad Money tells a good story and gives a few good laughs in the process, and even made me think a few times. Hey, I liked it.Best line, ""Hot damn, we're finally organized crime."""
4,Mad Money,I really enjoyed this show and am glad I bought it. Is worth watching again and again... I don't wanna say too much as I don't want to ruin it for others. (a girlie flick for sure)
3,Mad Money,"I love Diane Keaton, this movie was lighthearted and entertaining. If your looking for something that won't make you cry or scare you, this is the film to get."
3,Relax and prepare to Laugh,This movie is so far fetched that it is funny. The cast of women couldn't have been any better. They are so personable that you can see some of yourself in each character.
3,star power barely carries weak plot,"This movie just didn't keep me. The star power alone carried the weak, difficult to believe plot. IMO the purpose of a ""heist movie"" (like ocean's 11) is to make you think that you really could do something like that and get away with it, this movie didn't pull that off. I never got used to seeing Diane Lane in a janitor's jumpsuit. Katie Holmes was plays a looney tune, probably the only type of character that she would be good at nowadays. There is no moral to the story. No ""come to Jesus"" moment at the end. Instead you're left with the feeling that if you can steal from the government, everything's gravy. Not terrible, but worth a little less than face value."
4,Cash at First Sight,"This Movie is Enormously fun. Just on a personal level I have always liked Diane Keaton and Ted Danson ( Especially in NESSIE ), and Queen Latifah is always a good cast member in a movie like this , or basically any, and I could care less about Katie since anyone can do her role.Superficially its a very basic film, but apparently it took 5 years to put together. The Directors Commentary is very informative and states some key details that some film critics should learnh by heart. The Bonus ""making of"" film is short but very nice to watch. Essentially what you have is a great fun film experience that works superbly in 5.1 sound, and the bonus directors commentary informs the events. It was based loosely on a British event, but this is its own film and works very well. Not perfect, but well worth a buy as a film to take out and watchwhenever you need a laugh.And, as the Director says, Its a crime film with no Bullets being fired."
2,Mad? Barely miffed,"When Danny DeVito, Edward Norton, Robin Williams, and Rob Reiner came acropper with the monumental disaster ""Death to Smoochie"", it was noted that only truly talented people could fail so spectacularly. How though to explain ""Mad Money""? Callie Khouri is the writer of ""Thelma & Louise"". We all know the fine work of Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah. Even Katie Holmes has a track record far better than most of her generation. Not to mention Ted Danson. If these estimable folk had produced another ""Smoochie"", it would have been one thing. But they didn't even do that! Whatever else was true of Reiner's film it was never so plain & simply uninteresting and dull. The sad fact is, there's nothing really wrong with ""Mad Money"". There's nothing really right with it. It's just there. And to quote Gertrude Stein in a different context; ""There's no `there', there""."
3,Obus Forme Gel Seat,"I ordered this seat for my Victory Vegas motorcycle, but it was too large for it, so I had to return it. You would really need a wide cruiser-style seat for it to fit and not hang over. Nothing wrong with the seat itself. Good for a car or chair too. The price was right and it was delivered promptly."
1,Don't waste your time with this one!,"I read this book several years ago (before the movie), and it still sticks in my mind as one of the worst books I've ever read. The entire story line is unlikely at best, and parts (notably the end) are so conveniently contrived, it becomes silly and pathetically comical. Rent the movie if you're curious. It was universally panned, but it couldn't be any worse than the book."
2,Missing accents,"This book leaves out accents. For examples, take the verb abitare. In the pres. ind. this verb is accented as such: Abito, Abiti, Abita, abitiAmo, abitAte, Abitano. Unlike some of the other Romance languages, typically Italian only accents words having a stress on the last syllable, e.g., società. Therefore, the authors of this book should have used some means to indicate where the stress falls in various verbs deviating from the rule that the word is stressed on the penult. This is a serious fault with this type of work!"
5,Just what I needed.,"This is really helpful. Obviously depending on your level of playing but if you want to get going with learning blues, this is a great start. The video is a bit old, but Kieth was already a great teacher so it doesn't matter."
4,Bilstein Shock for 1994 - 1997 JAGUAR XJ-R (BE5-6725-M0 - HD),well it was time for new rear shocks for my 95 XJRI started looking but when it came down to it I had already replaced all the shocks on my wife's 07 Jeep GC and was over the moon with the difference so decided to go with them for my 95 Jag XJR only thing they are matte black not yellow like the Bilstiens on the front which where replaced by the previous owner they are not the original green colour like the factory Bilstiens but that does not worry me pity they did not match the yellow on the front but in my mind I know they are bilstiens so that's all that matters
4,Good reference book,"While I have no plans to be a reading teacher, (I teach math) this book was the text for a required course. It is a very informative book and has many useful strategies that teachers in all content areas can utilize to help those students who struggle with reading. Some of the strategies are just good teaching strategies, others are fun strategies that might make class a little more enjoyable."
2,Not worth ten bucks,"I've read all of the other Dorothy Sayers mystereiews and enjoyed them, but this was a disappointment to me. .The stories were very short and frivolous, not her better work.I would skip this one, given how expensive it is."
2,CH-LDV1010RS vs. CH-LDV1010B,Some merchants on Amazon are advertising the silver Portable DVD Player CH-LDV1010B ( as pictured ) but shipping instead a black CH-LDV1010RS.The CH-LDV1010RS is a slightly cheaper model. It is thinner but with a wider profile because the battery is located on the back of the unit instead of underneath the unit.

1,Looking for heartwarming Christmas? Forget this book,"I love romantic Christmas stories. I look forward to the Christmas anthologies published each year and save my favorites. This one is going in the garbage. These stories are soft porn wrapped up in a flimsy Christmas ribbon. Don't get me wrong, I love a good, sexy story as much as anyone. But there's sexy and then there's just plain sex with no characterization, no real story line and no real emotion. I read one story, and since I wasn't familiar with the author thought it might just be hers. I quickly flipped through two others and realized they were all the same--a thin Christmas premise to justify being part of the anthology and then raunchy sex scenes. I didn't find it sexy or romantic, just trashy. This book reminded me of the ""personal stories"" in the old Playgirl magazine we read in college. The first one was fun, but by the second of third one, you were bored. Don't waste your money!!!"
3,OK For Beginning Mac Users,"This is a quick reference book, small and compact. It would be excellent for the first time Mac user. Something to quickly review and get started right away on the Mac. I would even reccomend it for age 12 and up.For the first time adult Mac OS X user I would suggest something else like Max OS X by David Pogue."
4,Mac OS X Tiger: Pocket Guide,"This book accomplishes it's task - that is to be a quick guide to the Mac OS X. It has many tips and keyboard shortcuts. It touches on a lot of subjects, but it doesn't go into any detail; for that, you'll have to look elsewhere. I found the book easy to read and helpful. I'm keeping it in my laptop bag, right next to my macBook. But I'm also purchasing an additional book to get a more in-depth understanding of Mac OS X."
5,An important work of history and political theory,"This book is not for the fainthearted or for those who need to be told repeatedly what it is they are supposed to be learning. Hence, I suspect, the reaction of some readers to the text. Herzog spells out his purpose rather clearly in the preface, and he assumes that readers will be intelligent enough not to need to be retold over and over again. He then proceeds to demonstrate his point with an astonishing and fascinating collection of evidence from the period. It is a perfectly wonderful read, particularly for readers who are tired of abstract theory. What makes this work so powerful is its focus on and attention to details, which make the theoretical points much more powerfully by fully contextualizing them. The evidence is what makes this work worthwhile--as well as a fun read."
4,Step by step learning,"I like the step by step approach. Because of this, I also bought ""Teach yourself French"""
4,Our Marlins Shock the World - Again! [2003 & 1997],Very fine MLB films disk of the Marlinssurprise run to the World Series win forthe second time in six years. Great jobespecially for Manager Jack McKeon! Alsoavailable on VHS for old schoolers!
3,Clothesline doesn't stay tight,"I was looking forward to my retractable clothesline, set it up, tightened it, using the wraparound hook, and hung clothes. BUT, it slowly loosens up, getting lower and lower. I fixed the problem, using a clothesline prop, but shouldn't have to do that. They should stay tight like the manufacturer says. Otherwise, it's very handy on my back porch, because I'm unable to walk around on the ground at my yard clothesline."
1,Not Impressed,"After I hung this up, I only put a couple items of clothing on the line before it started sagging. The line will not stay tight no matter what I try. I rated this item a 1 because it does me absolutely no good if I can't hang more than two or three t-shirts on it. Complete waste of my money."
1,Shorter in length than description states,"Although the description from Amazon claims this product is 15 feet in length, it is actually only 13.8 ft (as per my measurements, and those stated on the box). Unfortunately, this was not long enough as our walls were exactly 15 feet apart."
4,need to use the entire length,"You have to use the entire length or it will not be tight, but as long as you rig something up to use up the extra length, it works great. I love it."
2,Not self-locking,I'm disappointed that this line doesn't have an automatic locking device. You must stretch the line and pull it as tight as you can with your own strength & then fasten it off around the hook. This does not provide a taught line across a 40 ft. distance.
1,Two failed in two weeks,"Purchased two. Hung both. Used once. Went to use them again in two weeks and spings on both had failed, even though fully retracted.I do not recommend this product."
5,Easy to install and very durable.,"I had to replace my outdoor clotheslines after a recent micro-burst storm sheered my 2 large steel pole clothes line trees in half. (AZ storms can be pretty darn powerful) Instead of replacing the steel poles and line, I decided to research and see other options, and came across the SecureLine. I ordered 3, and am happy to report, that the lines are much more durable than I thought they would be, and very easy to adjust to desire tension. I've hung out both linens and clothes on my new lines, and with the line pulled snug to a taught tension, the line stayed tight with very little sag. Very pleased with product.Natural Cures: 200 ALL NATURAL Fruit and Veggie Remedies for Weight Loss, Health, and Beauty (Health, Fitness & Dieting - Alternative Medicine)"
2,"Okay, with adjustments","The basic clothesline works fine, but the hook for the line broke after the second time using it. It just wasn't strong enough to hold up the clothes on the line. We found a stronger hook, longer screws and so far everything is working fine. The unit should really come with fasteners that will actually support a line full of wet clothes!"
4,Review for 20-ft retractable clothes line.,"The service and the product were fine. I had just ordered the incorrect item; I actually needed a 40-ft line. So, Amazon.com allowed me to return this one for a refund. I have now received and are using the 40-ft clothes line. I've had one of these for years and the cord finally wore out; and I wanted another immediately!"
5,Perfect indoor use,I live in an apartment and I wanted to save money on my power bill. I stoped useing my dishwasher and dryer. Those two are MAJOR power pigs. This indoor clothes line is perfect for my small space because it is retractable and can hide away when not in use. Very simple set up and easy to use. My clothes dried much faster then if I hung them in the bathroom and I was able to hang more up at once.
1,Plastic Junk,This product is all made of cheap plastic and the bracket broke after using for less than 6 months. Don't expect this product to withstand any normal usage.
5,Great convenience in a small package,I love the convenience of this small retractable clothesline. It is easy to use and works wonderfully. Better than I expected. I love it.
2,Doesn't work for anything under 40 feet.,"We purchased this clothesline for a space under 40 feet. When the line is out for any length under 40 feet it is not taut, so when you put the clothes on it it falls to the ground. We are returning this clothesline."
4,good quality,I haven't installed this outside yet - anxious to use it. It looks like it of very good quality though.
1,Not white!,"Ok - I can't comment on the functionality of this clothesline because I returned it without even taking it out of the plastic packaging. I bought this because I have white porch columns and wanted something that would blend in. However, the plastic casing (at least on the 20-foot version, which I bought) is NOT white as it appears on Amazon. It's a horrible 1950s pastel robins-egg blue. Unless you're 60 and live in Florida (I actually live in Florida but am not 60). So don't get the 20-foot version unless you love that color."
1,Unhappy - wrong color was sent,"The picture displayed was white and I was delivered a grey unit, which does not match the room, so I cannot use this product unless I paint it white (which seems more trouble than it would be worth)."
4,Tried and True,"Had an older version for almost 8 years. When the blades finally dulled, I bought this one and I'm very happy with it also. The optional Borner oval plastic bowl/platform that is made for this mandoline makes it even easier to use."
1,It is not this model. They've sent me Power V-7000 model,"I don't believe that they will send anybody Pro Model. As I've read already, it is not first time. They probably don't have Pro model, and send another model."
5,nothing much to say but incredible,"To see tons of Picasso works in one book is nothing short of breathtaking. This is easily the best Picasso book that focuses on his paintings. What's incredible is to see the prolific amount of work he was capable of, and just what a inventive genius he was. Without a doubt the greatest Artist of the 20th century. Not all the works make sense, or are even recognizable as anything, but that was Picasso; his art was how he viewed the world, and how his own heart felt inside:confused, and out of place. His Cubism is nearly mathmatical, and very intriguing. IF you're interested in Picasso as more than that weird guy who made all those paintings i just don't get, come and check out this book to see all of what he was made of. You'll be amazed and inspired."
1,Didn't arrive from the seller,"This was a Christmas gift so when my Credit Card got charged and i hadn't received it yet I began to contact the seller. They would respond to me immediately, even giving me a bogus tracking number that didn't track on the mail carrier site at all, then i called the postal service that was delivering it and was suppose to be their tracking number and they said that it wasn't their number. I paniced and got ahold of the seller and asked for my money back. Amazon immediately credited my account and i bought this book from a bookstore back east !! it is my son's book, he said it's the best book about Picasso ever, too bad it is now out of print because when you see this book you'll wonder why there are not more books around like it."
5,Realy Great book! Twists in the Plot are Knaak at his best!,"This is one of several books that I have read by Knaak, and I will tell you that he is one of the better writes I have discovered in his genre. He caries of his twisted plot and fasinateing characters with a realisim that is dificult to find in fanasy books, where most characters sound as though they have steped in from a bygone era, and tend to be a little streotyped. When Viktor discovers that he wears another mans body, the reaer will feel the shock along with him, and feel the sickening feeling when he tries to cast spells with too little magic. Not to spoil the plot, but just immagne when you find out what REALT happened to Viktors body."
3,"Started off funny, got ""pompous"" really fast","He says to shorten ""To satisfy her hunger for nutrition, she ate the bread,"" to, basically, Shwaz hungry, shhad sum. Hilarious real world example to start the book.But through the rest of the book, examples are drawn from politics and history. Politics really annoys me. Race, Gay and les, nationalism. And then theres stuff I don't know anything about, like Machiavelli and Shakespeare and Buddhism.I prefer topics and quotes from personal experiences, such as when you claimed to be borrowing your roommates groceries (bread) when you actually stole; friends and what friends talk about when they meet at the dining hall (bread). Easy-to-understand stuff."
3,Could be better,"This product looks all tough in pictures but it's really just as simple as the 3 dollar ones you can get at your sporting store. There's no variable resistance, and after a while mine started to squeak. And it's a pain because its the plastic that's squeaking, not the metal, which makes it difficult to grease.Don't buy this one if you want a hand strengthener, just get one of the cheapy regular ones."
1,Dont buy this grip,I bought one of these and after a month it broke.I bought another thinking this company wont sell a crap and guess what? That one broke the exact same way the other one did close to the month mark.I used it evry other day not much just in the office for a bit.So I tried one more because they did feel comfortable. But that one broke also. I wrote to he company and didnt get any kind of response. Dont buy this one.
4,Effective,"This will burn fat on your legs for sure. There are some ballet moves and regular style aerobic exercises to tone your legs. The ballet moves are plies, releves, and chases etc to get legs long and lean. But, Leisa makes it easy-to-follow by introducing new moves at half-tempo and using straight-forward cuing. You can choose whether or not to do additional hops etc for extra burn. The toning section is all standing barre work (you may need a good sturdy chair). She also makes this fun and interesting so you hardly know (till the next day) that you were working out so hard. Be warned! - you will be sore."
5,Highly Recommended,"This is a very enjoyable video, I enjoyed the way Leisa put the moves together and the pace of the teaching. The ballet moves are effective and make the legs feel it for days, in a way in which I want to do it again and again. I highly recommend this video, it will make your butt feel, your thighs and hips, it is a wonderfully inspired video that makes me smile and sweat, a neat combo."
3,Disappointing,"This was not a great Little Feat performance. They seem a little off compared to the last live show I saw. While they are tight and strong as always, the spark that would ignite a truly explosive set is missing. The crowd is having fun, but they're not over the top excited, like the crowd I saw go nuts when they performed in my area a couple of years ago. Then there is the botched sound job. You can hear the instruments sharp and clear in the surround sound mix, but the vocals are pushed way to the back. If you listen to the stereo mix, the vocals move forward but the instumentation does not sound crisp. Be advised that (on the copy I rented at least) the Audio Setup menu has the DTS and stereo mix entries reversed; ie, if you ask for the DTS mix you get stereo and vice versa. Personally, I prefer just listening to ""Under the Radar""."
3,Please release AUSTIN CITY LIMITS performance!!,The performance on that show was so much better than this. Let's hope it makes it on DVD soon.
3,Casting Crowns Sophmore Effort Falls Very Short of Good,"The sophmore effort of Casting Crowns seems to fall short of their self-titled debut album. Where the first album was a complete grabber on the first listen, this album seems to take on the form of background music at best. Lifesong, the title track seems to be ripped from U2's ""Where The Streets Have No Name"" and the music slows down from that point forward. There are no real upbeat songs like ""What If His People Prayed"", ""Voice Of Truth"" or ""Praise You With the Dance.""Maybe the album is deeper, more mature and has more spiritual meaning, but in my opinion, it was boring and worth only a listen or two before I tossed it into pile of cd's I'll give my mom."
5,What Sophomore Slump?,"This is Casting Crowns' second album, and it just might surpass the first for me in playing time and enjoyment. This is just about the best Christian rock you can find! Gritty vocals from Mark Hall combined with telling, right-on lyrics. Doesn't get much better than that. The best songs on this album are the title track, Lifesong, the pounding Set Me Free, Praise You In This Storm...well, actually, the entire cd is awesome! Go buy this!"
4,Broken Case,I was let down that this 'new' product arrived with a broken case. The CD itself was okay but I have to look at it from all angles.
2,Don't Buy!,"I rented this game from Blockbuster, thank goodness. The idea was alright, graphics average but the controls were awful and sluggish! It didn't seem to matter which car you picked because they all drove the same."
1,HOTWHEELS ?,Graphic is not nice at all ! The pictures are not well design and the colors are very dull. I didn't like it !Hot Wheels: Beat That
4,great game,it is action pack and there are plenty of levels and cars to unlock to keep the game fun for a long time.
3,My 6 year old loves this game,The game is great for my kid since its not too complicated. Some of the cars look similar to actual cars he has in his collection. He loves seeing them on the TV set.This game will be too repetitive for teen or adult gamers.Steering can be annoying. I think the intention was that you are able to tilt the controller to help with steering but my kid simply likes to hold the controller flat and only steer with the D-pad. Players should also note that there is a difference between DRIFT and DRAFT in goals.There are a few bugs too. Sometimes the game will freeze or stop playing background music and you have to reset the Wii to play.
2,Hot Wheels... Beat That,"The game is very good, nice graphics and lots of noise. I bought it for my 6 year old grandson and he likes it, but we cannot get to the point to figure out how to unlock the two other levels, so we are frustrated to say the least."
5,Complete Mute,"This mute is inexpensive and extremely effective. I have another, more expensive, mute that does not work anywhere near as thoroughly."
5,Great product!,Perfect for the conscientious beginner that doesn't want to necessarily drive everyone out of the house! Easy to use but it really would have been nice if it came with directions! I didn't have a clue how to use it until I watched the Online Piano and Violin Tutor on YouTube!!! It slips over your bridge on your violin. You can still hear your playing fine but it does somewhat mute it so that it's not quite so loud. I love it....and so does my family.
3,Practice Mute,"This product decreases the volume of the violin. This is the first one I ever tried so I have nothing to compare it to. I took a little getting used to, but it really works quite well. You can practice in another room without bothering anyone in another room. The intonation is about the same as it normally is. Works well."
3,3 stars only for Colin.,"Who told Mariel Hemmingway and Mike Binder they could act? This is a gawd awful movie with those two mannequins moving thru their respective scenes. Irene Jacob, Colin Firth and Stephen Fry give excellent performances with what they are given to work with. One would probably only buy this movie if a fan of the last three."
2,Basically a rehash of Magic Eye I and II,Nothing new for the 3-D afficienado here. First timers will be amazed. Doesn't have the artistic advances of a 3-D Book of Angels or Henry's Gift.
4,Flang-tastic,"I've always been impressed by the mini Effects Dano has to offer, but this one is my oldest/favorite. It's not top of the line by any means, but it's got a unique sound that people aren't expecting to come out of it. Easy and fun to experiment with in combination of other Dano pedals, and a DAMN fine bargain. Most Bang for your Buck, I must say. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Superb, detailed exposition of overcalls & responses thereto","This book presents a superb, complete, and clear explanation of principles of overcalling and responding to overcalls. Lawrence provides many tabulations of slightly different hands and shows how to distinguish them to partner. Thorough discussion of differences between match-point and IMP strategy is included. Responsive doubles are explained clearly, and examples clarify the inferences available from NOT making a negative double. Complete explanations of when, why, how, and how high to preempt are provided. This book is addressed to players already competent, and will help raise their competitive bidding to expert level. Buy 2 copies and give your partner one. DON'T LET YOUR OPPONENTS READ IT!"
1,Nothing impressive,What happened to Thalia? This was a disappointment compared to her previous work.
3,"Terrific, While It Stays On","These are a bit big and bulky, sort of like a shaved jujubee. Once you get it in place it really does work at keeping down the pain. That is, until it falls off when you eat anything."
2,Not what I expected,"I applied this at nite to a canker sore located between lower lip and teeth. The next morning I had a blob of gel that did not quickly dissipate nor could I remove it. As it dissolved, it created a gross liquid in mouth and throat. As I drank morning coffee, I swished it around hoping to help it dissolve quicker (took about an hour). The canker sore was definitely reduced in size, but I had irritation on the healthy part of area where patch was located. I have had good luck rinsing mouth with saline solution and using Campho Phenique Gel, applying with a q-tip. I think I will stick with those."
3,Single layer shim,This is the single layer shim that sticks on with adhesive after you remove the paper backing that protects the adhesive. You get four shims and the price is good compared with the $40 you will pay for the factory ones.
5,Good oscilating fan for small spaces,Good quality fan that can be adjusted for about any angle or surface. Love it and will use Holmes again in the future.
4,Used in a small greenhouse,"I specifically purchased this oscillating fan for a small greenhouse to keep my plants moving and air circulating through the chamber, and not as an office cool-me-down fan. For this it works absolutely fantastic, I leave it on the high setting while oscillating hung upside down in the growing areas - so far for several months, 24/7 and have had no issues.* On HIGH this fan moves air pretty decently* The clip is very strong, although big. It seems to grip on anything I clip it to, but keep in mind the entire assembly is rather large and you may have a hard time fitting it into a tight space.* The fan has a wide range of motion and angles it can be securely fixed atThis fan met all of my expectations and then some, and is a powerful little fan for the price and does the job well."
4,Insightful and left me wanting more,"I enjoyed this book, and would have liked to have gotten even more content from in. Having developed a good basis from this about who Jefferson really was, I feel compelled to read a great deal more."
3,Hood Surgeon Mixtape,"I bought this mixtape after going to his myspace website.The tracks he had on his website and this album are bangin.The music is good, but he's not his dad.....yet.The sound/voulme on the cd is kinda low on some songs, and on others it's just perfect. The lyrics are tight with good artists that can rap.Overall I would suggest you buy his mixtape, it's worth your money."
1,ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!?!??!,"Unless you are high on narcotics, no one in their right MIND would spend 200.00 on a damned!!!!"
1,Very poor product,Virtually impossible to open and rear hinge seperated from base while lid was propped open. Worthless in my opinion.
1,Think Twice Before Ordering This File Safe,"After wrestling this 70+ lb monster into my home (I'm thankful that I don't live in a walkup apartment), and unboxed the thing, I couldn't open it!!!! I've had friends try and it simply won't open. So now I have to ship this piece of crap back to the source. So don't bother is my recommendation."
4,Return of the Mills Brothers w/ a little Whispering Jack Smith,"A delightful and silly album, at times playful, at others sardonic (the French and English versions of ""The Ugly and the Beautiful"" / ""La Bete et la belle"" are filled with shrewd, ironic, and cuttingly clever remarks of insecure resentment!). Musically, the most fun is the ""Bathtime"" number. The 1930s samples sound to me primarily drawn from the original Mills Brothers--their early work as syncopated, scat/vocalese experimenters, done in the early 30s. His own breathy, close-mic vocals are reminiscent of Whispering Jack Smith (though he claims Al Bowlly was his hero). Great then, great now. Coates' follow-up album, Return of the Clerkenwell Kid, is also witty and weird, old jazz, pop, electronica, but this has more variety and daring. I hate to see them going for remainder-prices, but it's a good time to buy them both."
1,Very Very Bad Book,I thought this book Was so boring! There wasn't even to solve.If you read this book prepared to be bored.
1,Not so great. At all.,These books really have no meaning. There isn't any depth to the characters or plot. I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone.
3,Putnam Camp Memories,"I purchased ""Putnam Camp"" for quite a different reason than most. In the early 1940s & 50s I spent joyous vacations with my family, Aunts, Uncles & Cousins at Putnam Camp. The details described are all there - the stoop where we spent our evenings, dining room with the selecting of napkin rings, singing THE SONG to the tardy diners, lady's pool & shrieks from the cold water, and last but not least the singing of THE SONG to departing guests.Of course every day was devoted to climbing mountains.Wonderful memories - thank you George Prochnik.Patricia Ehle Goodall, Darien, CT"
2,disappointed,I was really disappointed with it's performance (or lack there of). It doesn't suck anything up at all (not even dust).
1,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk,"First this item came in a plastic bag. No info, no instructions. Second, it doesn't work at all. You might as well turn your keyboard upside down to get rid of the debris that would work a million times better. The vacuum has no suction wahtsoever. Very disappointed. Returning it shortly."
4,Supplement,"This book is a strategic step in my campaign to be able to read EGA. Namely, I bought ""The Geometry of Schemes"" in order to get a better intuition for schemes (which, sadly, Hartshorne failed to provide). So far so good. There are pictures and the Eisenbud clarity I so like. I still don't get schemes, but since I haven't really read too much of the text that is to be expected."
5,More than just a fire box...,"Approx. exterior measurements: 15w x 14-1/2d x 8h(Item was bigger than I expected from online pic)Can hold 8x11 papers without folding, just barely big enough for a 9x12 envelope.No shipping problems, item in perfect condition.Some similar items were listed as being made with plastic that scissors could cut through. This is not the case with this item. It appears very solid. Hinges are not visible and lock appears solid.When I purchased this item, I was just looking for something to protect documents against fire and water damage. I wasn't counting on something that looked like a mini-safe. I am pleasantly surpised."
1,Hinge disintegrates over time,"Beware. of this product. The hinges are made of a flimsy, unstable composite material (It looks like sawdust and glue). I have had this safe for a couple of years. I keep it on the floor because it is too heavy to leave on a table. I just use it to store papers and open it only occasionally. Recently the top right hinge disintegrated for no known reason. The bars that act as a hinge for the top cover appear to made of some composite material. One of the bars recently turned into a powder in a normal household environment. I would have thought the hinge would have been made from a stronger material such as metal. I need to replace the safe and I definitely won't buy from Sentry again. I notified their customer service but they didn't respond with an explanation as to why they used this material."
2,Faulty,"Hinky open/shut mechanism. It takes persistence to get the latch to click correctly and open. If it weren't so heavy, I would've returned it long ago."
1,Absolutely Terrible,Barely ever opened and closed the box and the left lid hinge has completely and inexplicably disintegrated into a powder. This thing shouldn't be allowed to be sold.
1,NO HANDLE AND A STRUGGLE TO CLOSE,"I BOUGHT THE HONEYWELL 2017 MODEL TO REPLACE AN OLD SENTRY PRODUCT THAT WASN'T WATERPROOF, AND IT WAS A GREAT DECISION. THE HONEYWELL IS LARGER AND THE SEAL CLOSES WITHOUT STRUGGLING. I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I WENT INTO STAPLES TO VIEW THE SIMILIAR SENTRY FIREPROOF/WATERPROOF SAFE, AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO CLOSE AND THERE WAS NO HANDLE, WHICH IS REALLY STUPID. THE HONEYWELL OUTSHINES THE SENTRY PRODUCT BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I LIVE IN NYC AND IT WAS DELIVED 2 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE. $34.99 AND FREE SHIPPING IS LIKE STEALING SOMETHING FROM AMAZON.COM."
4,Satisfactory purchase,"I wanted a small, fireproof chest in which to store some keepsakes and the Sentry chest ""filled the bill"". Entire purchase experience was very good."
1,"Hinge already disintegrated on arrival, as other reviews warned.","As described in other reviews, the hinge was already disintegrated into powder when it arrived. I'm not sure if it affects the fire/water safety, but it makes me question the quality of the rest of the product."
3,Not inspiring,"I appreciate the effort in bringing Kannada CD. It teaches A Aa E Ee ...However, its not as inspiting as the Nursury Rhymes here. It has more similarity to clasical music which is good when the child is sleeping.I guess my expectation was to have a fun way of learning the Kannada alphabet."
2,lcd tv,The tv came with one inactive pixle and had to me returned. The exchanged tv if fime now. The speakers in the tv are low quality but the pictue is good.
2,Had some of the same problems with TV picture going out,"TV worked ok for about 9 months. It's in my home office, so I barely use it. Picture quality was not that good, even when playing HD channels through a Motorola hi-def box. In fact, I ended up taking the hi-def box out and just connecting the coax to the monitor, because the picture wasn't that good - especially compared to a similiar Samsung monitor I have in my kitchen. Anyway, just fired it up, and I am experiencing similiar problems as some of the other posts - vertical lines appearing on the picture, the entire picture starts to shift down the screen, and for the few secons the picture locks in, it's purple. I thought it might be the cable signal, but it's the same signal that is powering my Samsung DLP, which is not having any problems. Unfortunately, it has the same problem when I tried to play a DVD to it, so I think it is toast. You get what you pay for..."
4,coffeehouse mystery series,I am working my way through the coffeehouse mysteries. I like them all and have not read in correct order but have had no problem with following the stories. I am a bit of a recipe collector so was thrilled to see some listed at the end of the book.
2,Needs an Editor,"This book rambles, has description and asides where they are not needed, and is so poorly written that it is difficult to read. I can't believe that a publshing house let this book get into print in the state that it is in. It reads like a rough draft.I'm amazed that I made it 2/3rds of the way through before I gave up on it. For that reason alone I give it two stars instead of one."
2,Less Gourmet Brew than Folgers,"For me this was a pretty standard blend of cute: good-looking independent woman becomes embroiled in puzzling murder, with the hook of having coffee tips interspersed between clues. I've read the same formula with both bakers and caterers, so far.The characters were likable, but not extremely interesting. Ditto for the locale and the mystery itself. A good way to pass a couple of hours and the writing was pleasant, but the book itself was pretty forgettable."
3,still can move the joint,I had hoped this would stabilize the joint better than it did. I was still able to abduct the joint and so wearing it for anything but sleep did not work. I think maybe my expectations were too high and I need to get a fixed splint.
2,"Stiff, uncomfortable, smaller than identical one from my dr's office","It hurts now just to wear this, so I gave up on it. The first one was from my dr and a small was ok. I bought two smalls online and they so much smaller, the strap doesn't reach the velcro to hold it on. I have a small leather one from my dr that is WAY more comfortable and worth the $60 since I'll actually wear it!"
2,Not Carroll's best,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who said this felt unedited. There's too much going on in this story for the 60 or so pages. Many of the familiar Carroll themes are there and the two main characters are engaging, but the ""aha"" moment felt rushed and incomplete. It probably should have been a longer novel, or at least one of the many twists should have come out to streamline the story. Nice illustrations and cover art by Dave McKean."
3,A bit infuriating...,"Too often in this book, there isn't sufficient explanation of strategy in spite of it's supposedly being a teaching book.Example: While listing scenarios, the answers say No comment if standard or routine play. Well, perhaps you should explain standard or routine play? After all, this book is supposed to TEACH exactly that! Frustrating!Beginners will get some value, but not as much as I would have hoped... Just too much left unsaid, in my opinion...."
3,"useful, but with with serious drawbacks","I have very mixed feelings about this tape: In general the format is good, but the presentation presents some serious difficulties. The moves require the viewer to mirror the instructor which leads to a great deal of confusion. The pace is extremely uneven and for a beginner it is not possible to repeat a move effectively. If one sticks with it, however, it is possible to learn this short form."
3,"Good quality video, but misses the boat on real Tai Chi Quan","Mr. Dunn does a good job of explaining the Chang Min Cheng form; unfortunately this is not real Tai Chi Chu'uan. The Yang Chen-Fu Tai Chi Quan long form is what the beginner needs to learn to really understand what Tai Chi is about. Following this video will result in mechanical hand and foot movements that will cause the practioner to miss out on many of the subtle and wonderful benefits of real Tai Chi Chu'uan. If you lack a real teacher, this video is better than nothing, and has excellent production values. Be aware however, that there is much more to Tai Chi than Mr. Dunn demonstrates."
3,Horrors!,"My warning to Doctor Who fans is--don't watch this if you ever want to look at #10 the same way again! Tennant was coldly terrifying, and I'm such a wuss that I couldn't look my screensaver in the eye for the next few days. He was demonic and menacing--all smiles and empty eyes--which were brown, ""but there was nobody at home,"" only an in-dwelling spirit of total malice. I do agree with other commentators about the weakness of the plot--why would everybody in a tightly knit family suddenly lose their good judgment over a complete stranger who has moved into--literally and figuratively--their lives? It's a long slide into hell for the heroine and a real nail biter all the way. Scary, but as I viewed it, I also had the queer feeling I was submitting to a kind of emotional abuse which I'd willingly taken on by continuing to watch. Can't actually say I enjoyed the experience."
5,Very good,"Made me look at David Tennant (Dr. Who) a very different way, he made me very nervous!! I Loved it!!"
1,Storm Warning,"Another product that was supposedly shipped on Feb 4th, but I have not yet received it."
2,"Sleek appearance, spotty performance.","Pros:o Sleek styling, slim, attractive profileo Reasonable costo Rechargeable batteryCons:o Profoundly out of focus using ""AiAE"" Exposure Meter; improved drastically with ""Center Weight.""o Noisy zoomo Poor low light performance, better with flasho Poor battery life (rechargeable), about 3 hourso Delayed shutter/flash makes it hard to capture fast motiono Poor GE product support"
1,terrible,This was something that was picked for our book club. I found it to be awful. Didn't read the whole thing.
3,Get what you pay for!,"This is by no means a quality set. However, it was not expensive at all. Some of the hangers are installed by pounding them in like a nail, which I did not expect. I thought that they would all be screwed in. I got the 20 pack for $10 and saw that they were still selling the 10 pack for $10. I would have been much more disappointed if I didn't get twice as much for the same price."
3,it's lacking something.,"i enjoyed the first fruits book very much. this one wasn't as good as i anticipated it to be, however, the clothing and geeky poses are still fun. i'd still reccomend this book to see the styles and if you just like japanese style in general. maybe the way people are dressed in the last book caught my eye more. if you have neither book, i'd get the first one over this one."
5,Excellent,"This is a great general reference for MS's TCP/IP. The writing is normally straight forward, and not as bland as the MS Press books. There are lots of useful diagrams and figures. For those studying for their MCSE, it'll help to flesh out any areas that those study guides just gloss over. It even includes sections on RRAS, PPTP, IIS, Exchange, and Proxy. At almost 900 pages, filled with excellent content, the price is more than worth it."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of both the series X:WP and Ru Emerson, I naturally looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, my expectations were disappointed.Not only does Go Quest Young Man prominently feature the series' least effective and most unpopular character (the ratings fall for episodes featuring him, which should have told someone something) but its most powerful draw, the friendship between the two leading characters, is virtually ignored.In fact the novel seems designed to be as unappealing to dyed-in-the-wool Xenites as possible. The wretched Joxer's name appears virtually everywhere, while Xena and Gabrielle are kept apart for all but 28 pages - and Gabrielle is presented for much of the time as a bitchy brat with pms!I hope the next book shows a closer acquaintance with the series and some appreciation of its true strengths. It has a devoted, long-term audience, but this offering is not likely to satisfy many of them.Inga"
3,We need some help here...,"As a fellow Xenite here, I read this book, and I was not convinced on a few topics. First off, Ru should have put down a better fitting title for the book, because halfway through the book, Xena heads for another misson that isn't made mention of at all. Mr. Emerson spent the first half of the book talking about a magic spell, which all in all made the story confusing. Ru did not make any mention of Argo whatsoever, and hey, if he really did watch all those Xena eps, and learned all about the show(like true Xenites would) then it would've been a more accurate book. The book was okay, but the wording and other things could've been better."
2,Had to stop reading,"The plot is great, as well as the setting but there is something that turns me off about this style of writing, there is more telling than showing."
2,Not worth saving a few bucks and buying from unknown seller,"Pleasures Exotic by Estee Lauder for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum SprayThe one i received from the seller seems to be fake. It has a yellowish color and the scent seem off and doesn't last long. I just ordered this online because i have a gift card to use and the one i currently have is about to run out. I haven't use it then and guess returning it back is an issue because you have to pay restocking fee. If i just bought it from Macy's, there wont be a problem returning it back. I would like to get my money back and return the merchandise."
1,Great symphony- Low quality CD,"An absolutely gorgeous symphony- especially if you like Mahler and Bruckner. I even had some suspicions that Mahler had ""borrowed"" a few themes from his mentally deranged friend Rott! Aside from the music itself, however, I was extremely disappointed by the CD recording from Arte Nova Classics (a subsidiary of BMG)The first disc was imperfect and skipped in several sections. Amazon was quite efficient in allowing me to return the damaged disc but the replacement they quickly sent, was no better. Still skipped in sections and had ""dead"" sections... I decided it was too much trouble to return it again. Maybe the recording session was flawed? I'll probably try to get this symphony on another label."
5,Zebrahead,"This Punk Funk album with a twist of rap is my favorite album with the rap then singing its something you don't hear everyday you might say limp bizkit is the same but they are not zebrahead has 14 tracks of shear delightness and to finish off the punk with a dance hit""bootylicious vinyl"" every punk listener everywhere should buy this great cd."
4,Excellent symbiotic mix of different musical genres,Excellent album. Songs take a mix of different genres and create unique compilations. Excellent sound quality. Most of the songs are fairly happy and upbeat. Overall very enjoyable.
4,"Great for educating kids on Greek life, costumes, and ideas","I showed this to my 5 and 7 year old after we'd studied Ancient Greece for 5 weeks. They both liked it a lot as it brought to life stuff they'd read. There's not a lot out there like this. And we find it really helpful to watch something at the end of a unit to cement the kids' learning. The 5 year old needed a fair bit of explaining. But still was fascinated by a guy choosing death because of his beliefs. Really well worth it. Bit of a shame all the actors had American accents! But a great and thoughtful production, nice and simple from the 50's I think without today's ridiculous emphasis on special effects which would have ruined the simplicity of such a production if it were made today.s"
3,Fun!,I actually only bought this for the magnets on the left half of the package. The pink one is sort of faded and not really as shockingly fun and outrageous as the others. I know those clever folks could have come up with something better...
2,disappointment,"This heater is either on or off and with only two levels of heat - hot or hotter. This is not at all what we were looking for - we wanted something that would come off and on to climate control, and have a fan for dispursement of the heat. We didn't read the specifics completely. Be careful that this is really what you are looking for before buying. On the plus side - it is totally quiet."
2,Broke down so easily,"After using it daily for about 2 months, it no longer works for no clear reason.Next time I will spend a little more money and buy a better product."
4,"Nice item, but has limitations","I purchased two of these heaters for very specific uses. It heats up very quickly and will raise the temperature of a small room quite dramatically in a short time. It also has an automatic shut-off if it's tipped over, which is handy if you have pets, especially cats. I wouldn't recommend it to heat a large area or to heat an entire room evenly, nor would I want to simply turn it on and go to sleep, since it doesn't have a thermostat. However, to heat a limited area of a small cold room very quickly, it's ideal and very inexpensive."
1,Quit after 4 months,"I bought this heater new on November 7, 2011. While it does not heat the whole room, it warms if placed 4-5 feet from your work space. It ran approximately 4-5 hours per day. However, it quit working March 7, 2012, 4 months to the day I purchased it. Taking into account the shipping time, it worked less than that. Before purchasing, I researched several space heaters. I decided on an infrared rather than one with a fan because the fan on my last ""milkhouse"" type space heater quit suddenly, and the heater casing heated so fast it nearly burned my fingers when I tried to turn the setting to ""OFF."" The experience was a good reminder never to leave a space heater unattended.This Optimus H-5210 heater cost $28.00, so while not a terrible loss, I can't recommend it. The previous space heater was the least expensive brand I bought at Wal-mart in 2004 and lasted 7 years.The one positive thing I can say about the Optimus H-5210? It did not start a fire."
3,OK for the Money.,I purchased this heater just to heat one small room so that I would not have to rely on the central heat.It worked fine for the 12 x 14 area and kept me warm all night. I would not recommend it for families with small children.
1,Did not work,"I couldn't get this to heat at all . Orange glow would kick on for about 1 minute, then kick off and not come back on. Waste of money. There are better options (Lasko)"
2,the one glitch,"This is for the folks on which the unit just quit. I had the same experience, but when I took the thing apart I found that one of the wires was faulty. With a bit of confidence it is easy to cut the bad wire out and replace it with a new one- a few bucks all told. Testing can be done with the unit UNPLUGGED, using a 'continuity' tester or a DIY tester using the wire in question connecting a flashlight battery to its light bulb, taping the wires in place. The repair required a single conductor wire with standard insulation coating. Make sure the amp rating is for 15 amps or better. The wire can be spliced on or soldered. It does in fact mysteriously quit working when this problem occurs, but otherwise this is a great unit for the price and power. I echo the other high star reviews."
5,freaking fantastiic,i love this little heater monster. my cat sleeps in front of it. it's instant heat gratification if you need that kind of thing. i do.
1,Flimsy and not very good,"This heater gave off quite a bit of heat, but was of flimsy quality and was very sensitive. It needed to sit ""just so"" in order to work at all...and it would cut out often. After only a few months it simply stopped working all together."
1,Dont Buy This. You will regret if u want a Heater,It heats really little even in a small room. This heater provides two choices of heating up. 400 w and 800w. The problem is The heater will automatially shut off if you turn of the 800w in every 10 minutes. I think it always overheat and shut down. Everytime I need to let it cool off and restart which takes loads of time. I really want to return this junk to amazon.
1,Terrible,These were terrible heaters. The heat did not radiate more than 2 feet in front of the heater. Total waste of money.
5,cost-effective product,"It's super quiet and warm enough for a 10'X12' room.The only problem is that it's burning within 1', but it should be the case for all heaters."
5,Best Purchase I've Made in a Long Time,"This is a wonderful, quiet, very efficient, easy to use, and safe heater. It was a great buy for the money. I am delighted with this purchase."
4,Very light...,Infact I thought that there was a mistake because the box it was shipped in was so light.This is a great assisting heater... great for the bedrrom at night if you're like me and don't want to heat the whole house at night.It stands very solid on the floor and you won't have to worry about it dumping over too easy.Don't expect it to save you skin if there's a snow storm outside and it's the only thing you have but all in all I am very happy with it for what I use it for.
1,Would NOT Recommend,If it hadn't been trash day (I threw out the box that it came in ) I would have returned both of these heaters. They are cheaply manufactured and do not heat well.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a sad heater. Very cheesy construction, but the worst is if I turn it on high, it turns itself off after only a few minutes. I have to unplug it, let it cool off and then plug it back in to get it going again. Who wants to do this every ten minutes? I don't."
3,Disappointed,The heater puts out plenty of heat but it's only useful if you stand or sit right in front of it.Doesn't help much to heat even a small room.
2,GOOG HEAT BUT NO THERMOSTAT!,HEATER WORKS FINE BUT THERE IS NO THERMOSTAT SO YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT ON CAUSE IT WON'T TURN OFF AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE.
5,Small but mighty radiant heater,"I actually bought two of these little heaters last year. One for myself and one for my daughter who lives next door. I wanted a quiet, small and efficient heater. I read the reviews, which were what convinced me. It has proven to be what I wanted, so I bought two more this year for us."
4,Great portable heater without the noise of a fan.,I have owned two of these Optimus heaters. I love them as they are radiant quartz heaters with no fan. Perfect for personal comfort in a big room or heating a small room. Has two settings of 400W or 800W so it does not run up your electric bill.
4,Great little heater so far,"I purchased this heater about 5 months ago and waited to post a review until I saw how it performed.I can say it is definitely worth the money,seemed to not increase my power bill at all.It has to be used in a small area to appreciate.It is dead quiet and light weight.I do not like how it is non-serviceable and would have to basically be discarded and purchase a new one oppose to shipping it for service.I would recommend the heater,a good value."
1,Short but sweet,"I bought this January '09, this year. It just died a couple of hours ago. Deader than a hammer. I got half a season out of it. It was really good heater while it lasted."
5,quiet and comfortable,"One of the quietest instant heater. 10 seconds after you plug it in, it warms you up. No fan noise at all. Great for office/library use."
5,Good product,Works well. Heats area just in front of heater. Not for heating entire room. Seems to be durable. Used sparingly for one winter season. Would purchase again.
3,Nothing's perfect,"Good little heater for warmth, and inexpensive. However, it's biggest flaw is lack of a thermostatic control. It's either on (with one or two quartz rods glowing), or it's off -- which means you have to keep fiddling with the on-off control, to keep from getting roasted .... a nuisance."
5,Great little heater!,"I've owned this and used it for about 3 months now, and it works very well indeed. Description states exactly what it is - a 1 room heater that will heat up your room if you shut the door and leave it on for a few hours. We use this every day and it's a great buy. We also have a different heater (Lasko) which is very good but trips my fuses, being twice the rated wattage of this Optimus."
2,Its small....,"I am disappointed with this heater. The size and shape is perfect for a small space, but the heat it generates is very very weak. I need to put my feet right in front of this heater to just feel the very very low heat it generates. I was thinking, when I bought this, that it will be similar or at least close to the Presto infrared heaters sold in CostCo. I have one of those and they are very powerful. I just don't like their shape, their very bulky... But when it get cold here in San Francisco, I dont have much choice but to take out the Presto Dish heater, it keep me and the whole room warm. As of the Optimus Radian Heater, their in the store room now, no use at all. :("
4,Works great!,"It probably puts out about the same heat per watt as my oil filled heater, but if you are in the same room as the heater it feels warmer because of the infrared rays. I would of given it 5 stars if the dial setting was easier to see."
4,"Toasty feeling, 400w & 800w, but gets hot easily on 800w","This heater provides a very toasty, direct heat. It has a safety feature that turn the heater off if it tips over. It has an additional safety feature that turn the unit off if it overheats (even without tipping over).The heater has two settings: 400w and 800w. On 400w, only the top rod heats up. On 800w, both rods heat up. On 400w, I would prefer the option to select which rod heats up depending on where I want the heat to be focused. Also, I find that on 800w, my carpet gets really warm so I'm placing my unit on top the box in which it came. That gives it ample distance from the ground and I feel safer this way.The overheat safety function kicks in quickly when on 800w - I would say it turn off in 30mins and then turns back on when its cooled. This is disappointing - I would prefer it be on at least an hour on 800w. On 400w, it lasts a little over 2 hours before turning off to cool."
3,Buyer Beware! Not original recordings.,"The online description says ""original recordings reissued,"" but the CD clearly says ""original songs re-recorded."" These are not the original songs that Charlie Rich is known for."
2,This book is fiction.,"This is a work of fiction about Law's Mississippi Scheme. Essentially, this book is a defense of John Law. Any non-fiction book about Law's Mississippi Scheme would likely be more informative and more interesting."
2,Too much UFO comments,Decently written but it has too many speculative comments about Bigfoot and UFOs. As if a foul-smelling naked ape that sleeps on the ground and eats raw flesh from deer and squirrels is going to get into an other-worldly high-tech UFO aircraft and fly to another planet or better yet - another dimension.It would be much better if they just reported the sightings and left their wacky metaphysical ideas out of the book.
4,An encouraging resource to add creativity to your dogs life.,Fisher and Delzio's book is very encouraging and helpful to those of us who wish to add more creativity and interest to our dogs' lives. The book is full of stimulating and fun activities for your canine and you or just your dog alone while you are away. Most dogs enjoy creative stimuli and this is just the book on how to train the owner. I found it most encouraging and resourceful as a loving and concerned owner of an energetic border collie.
1,Security camera with no cable or power supply,I have been buying security cameras for our businesses for 12 years. This is the first time the cameras did not come with cable and power supply. An e-mail to ANTonline returned an auto-reply that implied that they didn't know anything about what they sell. It's easy to be cheap when you only ship half a product.
5,So Great!,I just loved it. It really taught me how to appreciate my family. I hope Lurlene comes up for a sequel for this story. It'll be a bestseller!
5,the girl death left behind,this book is about a girl that lives with her family. and one day she stayed home that day because she was sick when her family left they got in a car crash the police came to her house and told her that her parents got in a car crash and they died. she had to go live with her sonitty cusin and her ant she went and that moth she went to a baebquie her step sister ask her to because if she didnt she couldnt go then she meet a girl at school and she took her to her house and she stayed the night over winter break. she went and saw her friends and at the end she desided to stay with her ant and her cusin.the end
3,"Great Content, Poor Binding","I have no complaints about the content of this book. It's pretty comprehensive and you have to get into pretty obscure vocabulary to find verbs that it doesn't include. Unfortunately I found the binding to be very fragile. I'm pretty gentile on my books, but even so, within the first week I was losing pages all over the place. Be aware of that and exercise extreme caution when turning pages."
2,Book is not very well bound,"This is a great resource. It's very helpful and well organized but unfortunately, the binding is poor. My copy has been used only a couple of months and it's literally falling apart."
4,Pretty good but a few problems,"On the whole, this is a good reference for beginning or intermediate students of Russian to have. However, in keeping with Beyer's teaching methods (he's a professor at my college), it often ignores complexities of the language for fear of confusing the reader. In most cases, this is not a problem, but there is at least one exception. There are russian imperfective verbs which have multiple perfective forms, and he only lists one, which might make you think it was the only one. People in one of my classes tried to use it to say that they'd cut themselves shaving and burnt their tongues drinking coffee, and instead ended up saying that they'd completely chopped themselves up while shaving and burnt their tongues to a crisp. So there are problems with the book. But it is certainly a useful reference."
4,Bravo for King's College!!!,"Great video and sound. Having been there many years ago, it makes me want to return--especially during the Christmas season!"
3,The Loves of Charles II: The Stuart Saga,I have read and enjoyed many of Jean Plaidy's novels and this is the one I liked least of all. It was frequently repetitious and at times quite boring.
1,Ten Little Indians (1989),Copared to the other versions of this movie this one stinks. It looks low budget and unravles to slow ant some parts and to fast at others. The best books Can be ruined.
3,"Great Movies, Poor Quality","These are two of my favorite romantic comedies, and it's wonderful having them together at a great price. However, the video quality of both movies is extremely poor. If you want to show off your home theater, this is not for you, but if you are just looking to pick up a couple of great movies at a very reasonable price, this I would certainly recommend this set."
4,the americanpresident /dave,"like the movie american president, dave was a bonus , dave is a funny movie the american president is showing a private side of the president we normally see in a movie"
3,Contraposed Features,"These two movies, The American President and Dave, are dyametrically opposite of each other, let the buyer be aware. Dave the movie, is both humorous, witty, and romantic, while The American President is serious, not funny, and very political, and when referring to political, it is meant so to say ""Political over embellishment"", as it might as well be for a political party or a political movement, that the movie was created. If someone wants innocense and fun, Dave would be it, although one would have to be prepared for The American President, depending on what Political Party they are a part of and what social underpinnings they came from and feel comfortable with."
1,What a mistake!,The Table of Contents of this book is completely erroneous (and it appears in the Butterworth-Heinemann Web). This is the real one: Chapter 1. Heat Exchange Equipment. Chapter 2. Evaporative Cooling Equipment. Chapter 3. Evaporating and Drying Equipment. Chapter 4. Distillation Equipment. Chapter 5. Mass Separation Equipment. Chapter 6. Mechanical Separation Equipment. Chapter 7. Mixing Equipment. Chapter 8. Calculations for Select Operations.
2,Uncomfortable boots,Boots were not very comfortable. I like the original foot clamp better on the board. Perhaps the boots work better on a bar set up.
4,One size fits most,"A more comfortable way to do the Batman upside-down thing on your teeter-hangup. Try the standard foot bar system first, and you'll love these. They take some minor fussing about to get into, but just about as much hassle as putting on shoes. The former gymnast/ballet-dancer of the house finds them to be perfect, but I have the legs and calves of a retired downhill ski racer (The life histories will tell you why we both needed the Teeter-hangup in the first place). I only get one or two ""clicks"" into the tightening strap around my tree-stump legs, but it's the same quality system that is used in ski boots- so I have no actual concerns. Can't do without them. Highly recommended."
4,Good Overall Introduction,"This book is easy to read and a good intro. to using Unix on the Mac, and the Terminal. It has enough information for most command line work, and will overwhelm you with some stuff that you are unlikely to use in other areas."
3,Great Musical,"Ok, the Musical itself is great - it's one of my favorites. Art Direction, Color, Costumes, Actors, Music, Cinematography, Singing, Dancing... everything is perfect.Only the DVD is the problem. I hate how Warner bringing out those classics movies on DVD: DVD-R, not restored, no subtitles (for hard / deaf hearing people or for foreign speaking people), no chapter menu, - the DVD-R its to expensive for NOTHING.Otherside: its good to have it now on DVD. I hope Warner will RE-RElease it one time in a better condition.Picture-Quality: its not restored but not bad.A plus: the DVD Cover."
4,Great little table.,"I bought this desk because I wanted a simple desk that matched the color of my kitchen table. It really is what it is, simple. The design is simple, the assembly is simple. That's not a hit against it because if that's not what you're looking for obviously you wouldn't be looking at this desk.Anyway, there isn't much to say about it, it's put together well, and it's solid after it's assembled.As far as the packaging goes, the other people that have reviewed this are spot on correct. The packaging looks like something you'd get from a table you bought at Wal-Mart. This is fine when all you have to do is run it from the store to your house, but it's really inadequate for cross country shipping. There isn't enough give in the packaging to be very forgiving of any mishandling. Luckily mine showed up just fine, but keep that in mind when you order one of these."
3,It's OK,"I have a small space to set up a laptop. The dimensions of this computer desk are perfect for a laptop. I use a wireless keyboard and mouse, so the keyboard drawer was a big plus. The height of the desk is great. The assembly was easy - the good stops there.The top is made of laminated wood and the wood colors are markedly different with dovetails showing. The pre-assembled drawer does not align properly and the width of the drawer is too small and the slide-out drawer wants to drop - so I am going to have to shim the sides of the slide-out drawer track. Installing the shims is fairly easy. For the price, it's ok."
3,Arrogance Pays,"Harold Clurman's memoir of the Group Theatre is enlightening and inspiring. It's also a bit dry. As far as showing me what a little fervency and passion can accomplish Clurman gets a gold star. However, their endless self-criticism and refusal to accept any script/production/praise as good seem to me to be a large part of their inability to continue. I believe I understand why the Group Theatre is a fundamentally huge building block of modern American theatre, but I think that we can learn as much from their failures as we can from their successes. If nothing else, we can take from ""The Fervent Years"" the notion that wishing we could have done things differently is worthless; instead we should learn from the past and apply those lessons to the present."
3,"Snapshot dvd star, Sigrid Thornton.","This edition is widescreen NOT full screen that I had thought. In comparing it to the ""Night after Halloween"" VHS version of this film. It does show all the top and bottom so it is not overmasked like other dvds are. However, there are parts on the vhs that show more on the ""side"" than the dvd! Especially durring the photo shoot.The dvd has her all the way to the left side of the screen cutting off part of her right side at times.The vhs has her centered, Much closer up and shows her entire right side. Very Strange, usually it is the vhs that has the side missing. Quality....Although the vhs is grainy at times, it has much more contrast and brightness. The dvd looks washed out and blurry in comparison. In short, not the greatest version of this movie. If you already have a vhs version, keep it and forget the dvd. mes."
4,Leslie Sansone--Walk Away the Pounds-Power Mile,"While I still prefer Walk Away the Pounds The One and Two Mile DVD, this one is good enough to use occasionally. I like using the weights and it's a good one mile walk. I do wish that Leslie would make a 1.5 mile."
2,save your money,"I have the older walk away the pounds from 2001. I feel like the originals had a better set & were more entertaining. I liked that leslie talked to the group as they walked.I'm currently 7-1/2 months preganant & I thought this would add some variety to my daily walking. This series is different from the other series, although I prefer the older series."
3,Leaves A Little To Be Desired!,"Marginal Records are to be commended for releasing STEREO recordings by the Crystals produced by Phil Spector. I have both the Ronettes and Crystals original phonograph record albums. I have the Ronettes in STEREO but this CD provided me with my first time to ever hear any of the Crystals stuff in STEREO. It is a joy to hear the stereo mixes but the sound is not that good and the bulk of the recordings are MONO. The MONO mixes do not sound as good as the ABKO, Phil Spector mixes. I urge Marginal Records to keep the re releases coming and to smooth out some of the rough edges of their remixes."
3,Ended up being a joke with my daughter,"So my 7-year-old daughter found this book so awkward, it ended up being a joke with us, yelling ""No! It's MY body!"" anytime we were within 3 feet of each other. BUT I think it did get the point across, even if she rolled her eyes. I'm glad I bought it, because even if she didn't take it seriously, it opened up a conversation for us to say it's important for her to speak up when something makes her uncomfortable. Might have been better if she was younger, like 3 or 4."
4,Good Book,It's a really good book and my 3 year old likes to practice with me what the book teaches. I think it's good. give it a try.
3,Read for the Story Arc,"Bruce Wayne: Murdered and Fugitive series is a good story arc. Nothing exceptional either in the story or the art. For some reason though, I do like the interaction of the other characters with Batman as the question his innocence.I do recommend it. I have read it a couple of times, so it is good enough to read more than once."
3,Great writing overshadowed by some very lacking art,"Don't let the eye popping cover art fool you, the art contained in Elektra: The Scorpion Key is very lacking to say the least. Chuck Austen (current writer of Uncanny X-Men, and writer/artist for U.S. War Machine) has never been anywhere near solid as an artist before he became an exclusive writer, and it shows here in this book collecting the first few issues of Elektra relaunched under the Marvel Knights banner. Brian Michael Bendis (Daredevil, Alias, Ultimate Spider-Man) has a very well crafted story here, but the disfigured art drags it down. Were it not for Bendis' stellar (as usual) writing, this book wouldn't be worth reading, but if you can get past Austen's art, this is worth reading for Elektra and Daredevil readers."
2,Over-promised and under-delivered,"Having spent a couple years now as a venture investor, I was looking for a book I could point entrepreneurs to, so they could get a better perspective on the venture investment process: what do they need to have in place, what's most important, how does the process work, etc. ""Inside Secrets to Venture Capital"" would take someone maybe 75% of the way there. Unfortunately, that's not good enough, as the lack of that last 25% would likely mean that the reader would head off in some unproductive directions. So I can't recommend this book to entrepreneurs I counsel, or to anyone else."
2,Quick Note,It is an interesting book for whomever knows little or nothing about Venture Capital.However it is completely outdated. It reports back to the year 2000. One can surely find more recent books on this topic.
4,This is no fluffy ambience,"Saul Stokes is a unique musician/composer in the truest sense. Aside from building/programing his own instruments his compositions are so sublime. He veers from melodic to experimental. This particular release is on the melodic side. There is a wonderful flow to the tracks which never becomes tedious. A lot of the music in this genera doesn't have much in the way of substance, where the music really has no development and makes no statement. Vast is multi layered and intelligently crafted. Highly recommended for fans of electronic music. You can get all of Stokes' releases directly from his website ([...]) for near half the price that commercial stores like Amazon sells them."
1,"Unfortunately, this is not a panacea","I was hoping to avoid antibiotics for my UTI. I took the entire container of the Crisis Intervention Formula, as instructed. And I'm lying here with a heating pad, begging for morning so I can visit a doctor!"
5,Awesome Knife!,"My wife loves this knife! It is used almost twice a day and performs ""extra Duty"" on the weekends, helping prepare all sorts of good things to eat!It has a very sharp blade that lasts. My wife used to cut her fingers when using her old steel knives. Now, she cuts exactly the way she wants to, without any effort at all (and no injuries!). This knife makes prep work in the kitchen fast and easy. I also bought her a Kyocera paring knife for Christmas - she already pulled it out and said she could't wait till then!!This past Sunday we cleaned, cut and prepped 16 bags of apple slices for pies in less than an hour and a half using a applepeeler and the paring knife. These knives are a ""must"" for the kitchen."
1,It's green!,"No where in the description or picture does it show a green knife. It says white blade, which is true, but it's misleading. If you want to sell a green knife you should say it is green. I hate when the photo doesn't match the product"
5,LRRP TEAM LEADER,"I have read John's book twice over and to tell you the truth, I lost a lots of sleep while reading the book I would not be able to put it down.I have read books by Ken Miller, Gary Linderer, Rey Martinez, Michael L Manning& Kreg Jorgenson. I rate this book with the others. John thank you for writting this book. Having been with Echo company LRRP/RANGER I can tell you knew what you were writting about. Roadrunner 6 out"
5,fianna is 'so cute',"i have 4 hair flair babyz(roxxi,cloe,yasmin, and dana)but i need 4 more to complete the hair flairs(fianna,jade,meygan, sasha.) fianna is absolutely adorable when i was little i had regular baby fianna and she was my favorite toy to play with."
2,A missed opportunity,"Ken Burns doing Frank Lloyd Wright. Expectations among fans of Wright's work were very high. But Burns fell woefully short in capturing the essence of the man and in explaining what makes his architecture great (and what makes the ideas behind it still relevant today). Instead, he spent too much time delving into personal scandals, as if the docu. was being made for the commercial networks rather than PBS! A mediocre effort."
2,This Is Not a Movie Picture Book,"I bought this dvd thinking that I wanted to see homes that Frank Lloyd Wright built, but this dvd does that no justice. This is a documentary of Frank Lloyd Wrights life, not a movie about his work. I do not suggest buying this unless you want to know about the man, not his work."
4,"Not a TOY, but a beautiful gift none-the-less","These lights are just awesome. Our daughters each have a set up in their room and they are absolutely in love with them. If something happened to these, I would gladly buy another set for them; they accent the room very well"
1,What a waste!,I bought these at the end of February and have only used them a couple of times.It is now the end of March and they are dead. I didn't save the packaging or I would have sent them back. They must be complete garbage because I have strings of Christmas lights that are YEARS old and still working just fine. My granddaughter is crushed that her butterflies won't light up. Thanks for breaking her heart with your poorly made lights. More garbage for the landfill!
4,Pretty butterflies,"The light of them are cute, fibers are along the wings and shining on the edges of wings. Butterflies are bigger than expected. It arrived in good condition. The only drawback may be that butterflies are in different colors but light is same yellow for all."
2,Bad Movie,The inside of the ship is completely wrong they used film clips of the queen mary to show the ship leaving port.This movie is not a good Titanic pic.
1,Simply the worst Titanic film ever produced.,"Are you looking for a good narrative of the events leading to the Titanic disaster? Are you looking for an accurate depiction? Avoid this film at all costs. Everything about it is horrible: the acting, the directing, the effects, the plot, and even the accuracy. One of the captions of the Titanic's tragic date is wrong! Watch A Night to Remember instead. END"
5,LOVE this book!,"I've loved the fairy tale _Beauty & the Beast_ since a young age, so when I found this book, I knew it was (IS!) a must-have. It doesn't disappoint. Griswold covers many (if not most) of the positive and negative aspects of this fairytale and how it can be ""translated"" into modern usage. _Beauty & the Beast_ is a fascinating story for many readers, and Griswold proves that it is the never-ending artichoke (a person can keep peeling back more and more layers to find further meaning) that he says it is.Highly recommended for anyone who loves fairy tales and their underlying meanings and history."
2,Not what its supposed to be,This product is not what it proports itself to be. How often do you need to take 12 tablets on an empty stomach???
3,"Sorry, Dolphina","Mostly, my low review comes from not being huge fan of the ""arabesque"" move. I was disappointed that it was relied on so heavily for this video. I've always preferred layering moves(think drum solo focus on belly/hips) to travelling steps. I would have preferred if she had used more layering moves. Theres a shimmy section (which gets you're heart rate up for a few mintues), and a hip section and an abs section (which are okay), but then a lot of travelling steps. If you are another dancer who prefers layering over travelling steps, don't get this video.Do to the lack of layering (sorry, bitter) you don't get a great workout.Also,I don't like the way it is broken up into sections: can't we mix it up!!"
4,Great book...worth reading,"Robert R. McCammon is one of my favorite authors and Usher's Passing kept me up all night reading. I could not put this book down. The characters are interesting, the plot is excellent, and next to Swan's Song, this is one of my favorites of his. You'll never guess the ending! :)"
4,A correction for the editors,With due respect I just wanted to bring to the editors' attention that not all the pieces on this recording are by Mexican composers. Oslvaldo Golijov hails form Argentina.
5,Works Great!,I have not used other products of this kind but I know that when we cleaned our reserve for the porta potty there was NO smell and all of the tissue had been broken down. I see no need to even try another product.
4,exelente!!!,es una excelente prenda de vestir. muchas gracias al vendedor por tan buen trato y rapidez.perdona por ponerte un feedback aqui pero me equivoque antes y ya no tuve otra oportunidad.de nuevo muchisimas gracias por su rapidez y atencion.
4,Great read!!,"Brilliant characters, great plot. Well researched and therefore ""unputdownable"" Must read more from this author. Flowed smoothly and kept the interest up."
4,good read,"good read, except have to purchase additional books. not available on amazon prime lending library. need 4 more words to submit review...done!"
5,Great read!,The characters were believable and the story line held my interest throughout the book. I look forward to reading more of Dee's books.
2,"Dee Henderson's ""The Negotiator""","I did not enjoy this book. Though the inspirational romance subplot was touching and well-written, the main storyline was confusing and overpopulated with only tangentially relevant characters. It was virtually impossible to follow Kate O'Malley's thinking as she completed her investigation, because I could not keep the multiple characters separated in my mind. It did not help at all that Henderson referred to many of the characters by name only. Without the chance to meet the ""suspects"", they remained simply indistinct names; the plot got lost in a sea of forgettable suspects. Also, though Ms. Henderson writes authentic sounding dialogue, the rest of the text is flat. All in all, a regrettably frustrating read."
3,"Good, but a bit too detailed for me","I really enjoyed this book, and read it in three days. I expected better, however, after reading high-star reviews of it. It was exciting in parts, and romantic, too. I like Kelly and Dave and the whole O'Malley family (though I haven't read the other books in the series yet). The main thing that I didn't like so much was how detailed it got into how they were trying to figure out the mystery. I wanted more action, less speculation and figuring. Dee Henderson seems to know a lot about police work, and I give her credit for that, but wish she didn't have to impart so many details that I didn't always undestand. I guess I'm a little picky. Overall, though, I liked it a lot, and wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,"Nice case and crime solving, too much preaching","I was pretty far into reading before I realized that this book was tagged Christian fiction. I usually stay away from that, but was too absorbed in the case and Kate and Dave to stop reading. The case was thought provoking and kept spinning in different directions. It was fun to work the case with them, at least that's what it felt like as I read. Will I pick up more in this genre, probably not. Good story though."
1,This is Love?,"I also thought this book was going to be a mystery, and where those elements applied it was well written. however when one really can't stand the ""Hero"", it kind of removes all traces of romance, this guy wants to change her from day 1. he doesn't tolerate her lack of belief, is constantly praying to God to help him suffer her till he can convert her. this to me isn't love, if he loved her he wouldn't keep trying to change her. i couldn't even finish this book as i knew she would be converted, this didn't fit her character as she had gone all her life not believing for a reason and seemed too sensible to me to fall for a guy so obviously lacking in understanding or consideration of her views.for myself i am Christian, and i still couldn't read this book so unless you like Christian books don't bother."
1,story or attempt to convert?,The plot of this book seemed interesting in the reviews. I was not aware that the purpose of the book was to espouse a religious belief. This blatant religious fervor was insulting and destroyed any flow in the narrative. I hope this review will alert others to the true purpose of this writing. Save your money.
5,I am impressed!,"In general I am not a fan of fiction books, but at the insistance of my mother I read this one and I am hooked! I have awaiting me books 2 and 3 and I plan to read the entire series - so be prepared to love Dee Henderson's work! The book is fast paced enough to be exciting without losing character development, yet leaves enough space for the rest of the series to fully delve into each unique member of the O'Malley family. There is a beautiful mix of mystery, drama, exctiement and romance without losing balance and tipping more toward one or another. A thoroughly enjoyable read!"
3,Pretty good,"Not as good as Danger in the Shadows, but it was still a nice light afternoon read. I am curious about the other members of the O'Malley family as it did give brief intro's to each so will probably end up buying the rest of the series eventually."
2,stupid christian action love story,"Boring story, could do without the accept christ angle, stupid plot.....author should start smoking pot and then might become more creative"
2,Good plot however,"I felt the book was ruined by the religious sub plot. The main plot was good, just IMHO didn't need the hijacking."
2,poor choice by author,"This author started off on the right foot with an interesting character and premise then decided to make it a religious crusade, which turned me off completely and distracted from an otherwise pretty good tale. I would not purchase another book by this writer in fear of hearing more of her religous beliefs via one of her characters."
2,The Negotiator,"This book was trying to involve too many stories at a time. I did not like it. Will not read another book by her,"
1,"Somewhat engaging, but awkward plot","I purchased The Negotiator thinking it was a mystery novel, which it is to some extent. I was not aware of the religious overtones of the book, and found their introduction into the story somewhat disruptive.The mystery elements of the book are engaging, and the overall writing is better than average. The plot line is relatively strong, and there is enough action to be engaging.However, the discussions of Christianity were rather forced. When Dave, the lead character, is reflecting on his religious beliefs, the text is consistent with his character. The discussions about God are awkward, and Kate's sudden conversion to being a ""believer"" based on a deal she constructs with via prayer is not a good fit with her characterization in the novel.Anyone who wants a G-rated read will enjoy this book, or if you can move past the over management of parts of the storyline, you may enjoy it overall."
3,"Interesting, but too religious for me","I really enjoyed the character development, particularly of the two main characters. I found all of the O'Malley's, and their story of coming together to form a family, very compelling. Then various characters began their attempts to help Kate ""find God"" and I almost gave up on the book all together, it was just too much. I persevered and continued to like the book overall, but every time the subject of religion was raised (which happened over and over and over) I was completely turned off by how the subject was approached, it was far too preachy and prolonged."
2,Its Cranks.. but disappointing,I have had two of the other Cranks cook books that I bought in England a few years ago. They are absolute treasures. This one.... doubt that I will use it much. Nothing really creative or inventive and the way it is organized is cumbersome.
2,Very Odd Little Clock,"I purchased this clock on clearance at Office Max. So glad I didn't pay full price! It is an attractive clock, and keeps the time well once set, but when Congress decided in all their infinite wisdom to change the daylight savings time beginning and ending dates this poor little clock got majorly confused and couldn't set itself. Very disappointing. I love clocks and have more than a dozen in my home (I hate to be late), but when one is off it really gets annoying."
2,Fix for 2007 daylight savings time,"I called Sharp Electronics (about the failure of the clock to detect the new 2007 daylight savings time), and it turns out Sharp Electronics is a different company then Sharp who sell/support the atomic clock. I got the number for this company and these are the instructions for updating the clock's time (should work in any time zone).1) Pull the batteries and wait a few minutes.2) Put batteries back in - time will set to 8:00 (or possibly something different).3) Press the ""leverage button"" (just above an to the left of the time zone buttons) and the clock hands will spin.4) Release the leverage button when the correct time is reached.5) Supposedly, this new time will track correctly and keep accurate time.I asked what would happen next fall, and they said if if didn't track correct, steps 1 and 2 above should be sufficient.Hope this helps - not the greatest time piece to be sure."
1,Do not buy this clock unless you are positive the NIST radio signal is strong in your area,"I bought this clock because it has a simple and attractive design. Both the packaging and the user manual claim that you don't need to be within range of the NIST radio signal to use the clock. Supposedly you can set the clock manually and instruct it to keep time with its internal quartz based timer. As far as I can tell, that claim is false.After following the manual setup instructions precisely, the clock will immediately begin searching for the NIST radio signal again, which it inconveniently indicates by spinning the hands of the clock fairly rapidly. (Don't ask me why it can't just keep time while searching for the signal.)"
5,A great album.,"....P>This was one of the best albums of 2002. It is definatley something different as to my knowledge i havent heard prog rock mixed with emo much before. Either way, the end product is quality and if you're curious, listen to a song or 2. If you like it, buy this album. I like it alot."
3,Interesting Debut Album; but you can tell it is a debut album,"Coheed and Cambria is an absolutely amazing band, and 'Second Stage' only proves that they have grown alot since this album came out. It starts out strong with an instrumental track leading into one of the cd's strongest tracks, ""Time Consumer"", a slow-burner by coheed standards. The lyrics, while a little harder to decipher are, as always, beautifully poetic. There is also a little more prog in this album than In Keeping Secrets, but that is the downfall of Second Stage. Some of these songs seem to have been written for pretty regular play, but they added another 2-3 minutes on it to kill the momentum. There is also more screaming on this record than the new one, which is good or bad, depending on how you look at it.All in all, it would have been more impressive if a different band put it out; I just expected more out of C&C;."
4,Prepare to be pumped,"If you like action all the timeAnd yawn at endless blatherSit way forward in your chairOr stand up if you'd ratherInjected with a Chinese drugHis ticker's barely tickingThe adrenaline has got to flowOr else he'll take a lickingHe's forced to find so many waysTo keep his mojo pumpingCocaine, brawling, epinephrineAnd very public hump1ngDefibrillators, nasal spraysShock treatment, boosters, pillsHe has to do it all you seeSo we can share the thrillsHe has to find the guy whose needlePut him in this messAnd if there is no antidoteHe'll be in worse distressThis one is for all Statham fansWho don't care much for plotIt's action, non-stop, all the timeAnd Statham's really hotAmanda Richards, October 28, 2006"
3,Needs More Hand-To-Hand Fighting,"This is good action movie, but there is a lot of chasing and when there is fighting, it's mostly guns. I was hoping there's more stunts of clever hand-to-hand combat, like Transporter. I don't like it when Jason runs around in a hospital gown, because you just can't look tough in that kind of get-up. I also think it's bad taste, when there's a scene of Jason and Amy Smart having sex in public. I would prefer it in a bedroom with Amy showing more skin, but I guess the scene that ended up in the movie was suppose to be funny, but I found it awkward. I bought this movie because I like Amy Smart, but her character seems useless. The movie could've been the same without the girlfriend."
3,It was OK,"It was an okay movie. I love Jason Statham but this wasn't his best movie. I wouldn't by it brand new, I say wait til it's on sale at wal-mart for $7.50."
1,Emerald33,"If I had seen this in the movies, I would have walked out and asked for a refund. It was indescribably terrible. I returned this DVD because I really, really didn't like what I saw."
5,CRANK ROCKS.,I just wanna know what the correct aspect ratio is? The box says 2:35:1Once it plays it's reduced to 1:85:1Anyone know? I'm thinking it's a misprint.Crank rocks!
2,Stupid and annoying,"A man spends the entire film on an adrenaline high smashing and killing everything in sight in order to keep his pulse up so he won't succumb to some mysterious ""Chinese"" poison. There is almost no dialogue here. The only relief is the man's dumb blond girlfriend who doesn't notice all the violence all around her until it hits her in the head. This was made by a couple of camera operators more into the angles and weird stop action than the actual plot, script, soundtrack and storyline. There, it's lacking."
5,A real blast!,"Jason Statham is on top form here. This is great entertainment, full of surprises, great (& some very funny) scenes as well as a lot of surprising ideas, for when Statham's hitman has to keep his pulse well up to prevent himself from dying of poison.A surprisingly enjoyable film - top stuff!Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Terrible,"I like Jason Statham, but this movie was terrible. I almost had motion sickness by the end of the movie. The sex scene in chinatown was beyond stupid. The blood was overdone, the action was too much. All in all, I'm sad to say I did watch this movie. Don't watch it, unless you like cheesey action films."
3,"it is what it is...cheesey, campy and over the top","My friend who has an odd fixation toward cheesey movies brought over Crank and Crank 2...so we got to see a double feature. He loved them both for the campfest they were. I'm not big into action flicks but I did find some parts absurdly funny. They were so absurd I couldn't help but laugh. I loved the character of the Doc who kept giving him advice along with his receptionist/hooker friend Chocolate. I also found Chev's character amusing...poor guy....just when he thought things would be almost resolved something goes wrong and you end up having to have sex with your girlfriend in the middle of Chinatown, while a bus full of students watch and give commentaries on. The only complaint I had was with Amy Smart's character...her character was a bit too dingy..although I found it funny she refused to get a cell phone."
2,Under average for sure,"Really bad acting.Poor story.Bad musically.Unprofesional making.Lot of clichés""I want to make a film as Tarantino"". But certenly unsuccesful.Don't buy it for sure, rent it just if you're sooo boring"
2,"Good blu-ray, boring movie",I though the blu-ray was very good but I found the movie predictable and very boring. I bought it because of the raves of the HD quality and it is very good in that respect. I hate the movie itself though.
2,Dorky,"It's a constant stream of scummy teenager-like, foul-mouthed dorkiness. Some intelligence would have been helpful. Nothing even remotely praiseworthy."
2,pretty dull,"Any influence in jazz is *extremely* overrated. Don't let that first line in the review trick you.A Great Divide includes your typically cheesy heavy metal guitar riffs, with small doses of Japanese-influenced jamming (such as in ""The Singer"") to elevate the experience to a level only *slightly* above average.This entire album simply screams of generic heavy metal such as what you'd hear in any given Castlevania video game, but without the melodic quality or the originality to really make this kind of music stand apart from the rest.The orchestration drowns out the generic guitar riffs *just* enough to make this kind of metal not unbearably heavy though.The fact this kind of heavy metal has been done so many times for several years now really shows how important the original masters of heavy metal are (such as Metallica) so we should value the originators and ignore the poor imitations."
5,JUST A GREAT READ!!,"Right from the first story, about a nuclear holocaust, the book catches you..we see a pretty realistic view of what would happen thru the eyes of a superhero. COnsidering I was expecting all fun, this was totally out of left field and very interesting. NO happy ending in this story-everybody just dies. Wow! Otherwise, very imaginative and fun stories all the way thru. I love this stuff and these were chosen well. Im not huge on Jimmy Olsen but this is a very fun story..Also the kids of superman story has a very interesting psychological element adding some actual depth/richness to the characters in the story. Overrall, a great compilation much more varied than you'd expect.So lighten up from deep angst, gritty violence and huge veiny muscles (and tiny heads)of the current stories. Consider whimsy.."
1,This doesn't work on showers at all,I tried this material twice and it didn't work at all and to pay over $5.00 a tube is stealing from consumers. I hope you plan to remove or change your marketing program because this stuff just stinks.
2,It was boring to me,"The moves were not challenging, and the whole time you're repeating movements with Dolphina keeps on saying ""beautiful!!"" a million times ... I bought this VHS because I wanted to try a new workout, however, I don't find it effective ..."
3,"Big Size, Looks Cute, But not the Best Quality!!!!","The product was shipped quick (although i had express saver shipping) and i received it in less than 4days of ordering it.I gave it to my gf who has it by her pillow on the bed and is big enough to be used as a pillow. the problem is that the stitching on this item is not the best / the quality is not the best. we have restitched torn threads twice in the past month of buying it, but I saw another small hole on the stitch and the beads started coming out ......it is good if it is just for display, else be very careful in using it."
4,"Promise Ring's new album promising, but a lot different!","After hearing The Promise Ring's latest release Wood/Water, I gotta say I was somewhat disapointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a great album, but it's lacking something that was there in their previous releases. The new album is more refined, smoother, and lacking the raw agression that attracted me to Promise Ring in the first place. Like I said though, it is a great album, just not what you'd expect!"
4,Rings arround the rest.,"Great disc. I have no idea what the complaints are about. Bands change, and for some reason some people don't. This album shows us the same raw yet warm sound as before, with a little better composition. Don't get me wrong, the old material is great, but with songs like 'Stop Playing Guitar' this band has really found a compfortable unique sound that is quite easily listenable. Sold out is a term we shouldn't throw arround. Reserve it for bands who release albums on money not music. Progression: it happens. The Promise Ring have matured, and it sounds like some need to follow suit. The Promise Ring are still in my eyes everything a sell out isn't and Wood/Water remains one of my favourite discs."
3,Missing parts on half of binders ordered,"Binder does what we need, we have used 7 of these per fiscal year for several years. Ordered now through amazon due to a slightly cheaper price. 3 of 7 arrived missing 1 of the 2 plastic / nylon posts. No rips or anything in plastic, must have come that way to Amazon from acco. Ironically, there is a sticker on each sawing ""Now comes with nylon posts."" Ended up returning 2 of them, being able to complete the third with a post from the second.So trying to save money, ended up wasting a man-hour doing the return paperwork."
3,Smaller than expected.,"The product did arrive in a timely manner and there were no deffects with it. However, the book was small enough to fit in a shirt pocket easily. I was expedting a more comprehensive guide to the Portuguese language. The words in this one were what any near-fluent speaker would know and I couldn't get much out of it. It would be great for beginners, but if you lived in Brazil or Portugal for more than a few years and spoke the language, it may be too simple for you. Langenscheidt's are the best foreign language to English dictionaries out there."
3,Saint or Heretic?,Takes place in France 500 years ago. God had chosen Joan to save Orleans. The English believed Joan to be a witch. She was condemned as a heretic and sentenced to death by burning. An O.K. children's adaption of the Arc legend.
5,A+,My daughter's 6th grade english class read this but had no extra copies to bring home. Having a copy here at home allowed her to read at her own pace and really understand the material. The Iliad is pretty heavy stuff for a 6th grader!
3,this story was alright,"This was a story that we had to read in class. I didn't like it at first but after a while I grew interested. This story was filled with a lot of action and had much detail, I would recommend it to a middle school-high school audience. I give it 3 stars!"
1,Not as advertised...,"I read the reviews and took my chances. As advertised two movies, The Little Princess and The Secret Garden. I had my heart set on The Secret Garden since my children have seen a Little Princess. It was not on the DVD. Like two previous posts I have tried everything and no Secret Garden! Not happy about that and the inconvienence it will take to return the DVD."
1,duplicate cd's,"Very dissapointed, how do I get ""A little Princess"", I love both movies, but when I opened the cd after weeks of arrival, to my surprise there was two cds for ""The Secret Garden"". Secret Garden was great, but that's not what I wanted I ordered the family double feature, instead I received the famiy singel feature two cd's with the same title, I don't need two ""Secret Garden"" cds. How can I get back my ""A Little Pricness"", I don't want to pay again, and I had already thrown out the packaging slip, and the cd has been opened?"
1,Fullscreen Only,"Despite the claims on the packaging that this includes both widescreen and fullscreen versions of each film, it only includes the fullscreen versions.With as visual of a director as Cuaron, ""A Little Princess"" should only be seen in its original unmodified presentation. Seek out the individual releases for each of these instead, to get them in their proper aspect ratio."
1,"Not as picture shows, Not a Double Feature",I got this thinking I would get both the Little Princess movie and the Secret Garden movie. But all I got was one DVD with a two sided Little Princess. I was very disappointed seeing as I really only bought it for the Secret Garden movie.
5,Great quality movies for young girls,Two wonderful movies for young girls. My daughter watched these movies repeatedly and always wanted to share them with her friends who had never seen them before. These movies are timeless and make nice presents to give!
4,Suspensfull and well written,"I've been a fan of the resident evil video game series since the release of RE2 in 1998. Amazingly, i've played every resident evil game EXCEPT the first. that includes the shootout game and versiona for playstation, dreamcast and gamecube. Needless to say, this was a great read and i fininshed it rather quickly. i here it follows the game quite well, so i think i might go out and buy the game. I have the 3rd and 5th book too (they're based of the RE2 and NEMISIS video games) but haven't read them yet, be cause after reading the first one, i think i want to read them in order. if the otheres are anything like the first, i'm sure i will be more than pleased."
4,best book ever written!,"I highly reccommend this book to older readers because of the graphic descriptions and swearing. The problem is-S.D. Perry id not so well at describing the areas that the characters are in. And everybody sighs inwardly, therefore I would rate it 4 S.T.A.R.S....,lol."
2,R.E. the Book---WHY?,"When I first saw the book I thought it would be a new perspective on the events at the mansion, maybe from a new character or two (a couple hikers) that entered the mansion the day before. Instead, we are taken through the same story-line as the video game, which came across as a little redundant. Perry relies too much on the idea that the reader has already played the game, and expects the reader to know the enviroment and mood of the book. She does not do a good job of describing the mansion, or the origin of the creatures. I would have liked a story of the mansion itself before its downfall. The idea of what went on in the building and how it became over-run sounds more interesting then reliving the video game scene by scene. But, it is the only R.E. book out there, so I will suggest you read it based soley on that. But, again, it follows the game so closely that you can always predict what happens in the next paragraph."
2,Ameteur writer!,I've read all of the Resident novels by S.D. Perry and I think they are more funny then horrifying. The silly lines Perry has her characters reciting had me rolling on the floor in mock hummor. I don't think Perry is a good writer and I don't think she will go far as a matter of fact I'm dissapointed in Capcom for allowing Perry to have the privliage of writting a Resident Evil novel.
1,GARBAGE,"I can't believe I wasted money on this junk. After impatiently waiting to read this series of books, I was terribly disappointed. I have read the first four books in this series and wasted my money on every one. DON'T BUY THESE BOOKS! The author doesn't know anything about the Resident Evil games and insults people who have played them. They read like they are written by a small child who is failing beginner English. Trust me; don't waste your money."
1,A Mediocre Novel on a really silly game.,"S.D. Perry is a decent writer but her best work seems to be only the Aliens paperback series. Resident Evil never had a good story to begin with. Heck, Resident Evil wasn't even an original game at all. It's a big rip off of the old PC game Alone in the Dark by Capcom, a stupid software developer who makes crappy titles. And the book, while a bit better, doesn't help Resident Evil much. If you want good some good novels or stories, do yourself some good and check out authors like William Gibson, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, or Kevin J. Anderson."
4,So far so good.....,"I haven't read the whole book yet (they've just now entered the mansion) but so far it's pretty cool. I liked the additional news-paper clippings in the prologue, and I LOVED how it described what the characters were doing that led up to the events in the game. However, I do not like how Jill swears so smegging much. Yes, it makes it more life-like, but she didn't swear in the game and her swearing in the book seems WAY out of character (this is why I give it 4 *s). I really LOVE the way the author goes into more detail with the introduction than the game provided. I am most decidedly looking forward to finish reading the book and the following books."
3,An excellent author with a tedious book,"Dr. Lu has many excellent books available on this subject. This is not the best choice. He has another book by the same title that is absolutely beautiful. The information is presented differently in that book, with more clarity and accessibility. This edition is very cumbersome. It does has some excellent information on treatment therapies for specific Chinese Diagnosis', as well as ingredients to some herbal formulas. The formula that Dr. Lu presents to reach a diagnosis is difficult to understand, his positive/negative number scheme is not easily comprehendable. There are many other books that require less time commitment and concentration to arrive at the same understanding."
2,Very confusing,"I bought this video based on other reviews, I am sorry that I did. He is very confusing. He is constantly saying step with right leg turn 45 degrees. But when you watch the video it looks as if he turns half way around. Everything is mirror image and you need a lot of space for the movements. I think the beginning part is okay but the second is more frustrating than relaxing. I have not moved on to the third part as I get frustrated with the second and turn it off. The camera angles are terrible and he should maybe do things opposite so that we at home do not have to keep reminding ourselves..opposite, Opposite!!!! (I am a mom of 4 and have limited workout time and I can not spare the time for this frustrating video) I bought another at the same time by Dominic Stefano and it is alot better. I will look for more of his videos and avoid Mr. Terence Dunn's work. Perhaps when I retire and have time I will take a class."
4,A Great Supplement to Class Training,"First, I want to answer those who said they were confused by the video. Tai Chi,like other martial arts is not something that you can or should attempt to learn on your own from a video. You need a teacher. You will never fully learn the art unless you have a teacher. There are no exceptions.Having said that, this DVD is an excellent supplement to class training. Yes, it can be a bit confusing if you're constantly looking at Terry, but then since the Tai Chi form is constantly changing directions, this confusion would be difficult to eliminate. A bird's eye view would have been most helpful, and had the DVD had such a view, I would have given it five star.So, do not watch Terry, since you can't anyway without distorting your movments, but rather just listen carefully to what he's saying, which is very clear and nicely done. This in combination with regular class attendance will advance your art quickly."
4,Very Encouraging for Beginners,"The reason I am buying this tape is that the one that I have been using from our library is completely worn out. This tape presents tai chi in a very non-threatening way and although Mr. Dunn does explain some of the spiritual aspects of the forms, one does not feel the need to convert to a new religion to enjoy the benefits of Tai Chi."
3,Price Guide lacking current collectable prices(1998),"If you're buying this book as a priceguide to old or collectable frisbees, you should know this. Since the advent of online auctioning after 1998, many more frisbees have come out of the closet. Therefore, the priceguide part of the book is woefully out of date. Most collectable Frisbee prices as stated in the book are overvalued by 30-60%. I hope a revision of this book is printed soon."
4,So I admit I'm a fanatic.,"Having hated the regular D&D; magic system since I first learned about it, this book offers a wonderful alternative. Wizards don't just forget their spells when they use them once, and none of the magic relies on the basic assumption that your mythology is correct.Better yet - noone can abuse the system to have a completely broken character before even taking their class levels, and dragons aren't color coded for your convienence. No elves, no orcs, no dragonkin, no easily available flaming swords.It even contains a feat to break that spiked chain strategy.Sadly, as everyone else has mentioned, the editing could definately have been improved. However, that can be overlooked since it really does capture the low-magic grit of the setting in the series.Gotta love it."
4,Great little rice cooker!,"Terrific little rice cooker. I was tired of the mediocre rice I made in a pot on the stove. After being served delicious rice made from a rice cooker, I decided to purchase one. Online research showed that the Zojirushi products were well-recommended. I'm very pleased with the quality of the rice I now make in my rice cooker. I'm experimenting with lentils in the cooker, and pleased with the results. One caution though -- moisture collects in the rice cooker and it does not dry out in a day. After removing and washing all the removable parts (cooking pot and inner lid) and letting them dry for over 24 hours, if I reassemble everything and close it up to store, the next time I get it out I find water in the cooking pot. I now store the rice cooker open with the inner lid left out. It takes up more room in my cupboard this way, but now there is no chance of bacteria growing in a moist environment."
4,Compact and Stylish,When this arrived I realised that I'd ordered the wrong one! I meant to buy the larger model. I couldn't be bothered returning it and have found it to be great. It has more than enough capacity for three rice servings and we are fairly happy with it. It does take far longer than boiling a pot of rice but the rice comes out perfectly and does make a difference to the meal.
4,15 months and going strong,"Have had product now for a year and three months, having ordered it after reviewing a number of rice cooker reviews.Cooks rice well and reliably. Easy cleanup. No mechanical problems thus far. Timed start works well.It has folded itself into the mainstream of our cooking and seems to stay on the counter more than beneath it. We have no regrets so far with this machine.Main beef is the instruction manual. It kinda stinks. Organization is confusing and, doctorate education notwithstanding, I found myself scratching my head a few times, wondering what was meant. Poor language translation is probably part of the problem.Music tones are a little dorky, but we sing along anyway!"
4,Awesome Rice Cooker,"After reading several reviews, I purchased one so that I wouldn't have to watch over rice cooking. My mom came to visit, tasted the brown rice & loved it. I bought a second one as a gift for her."
5,Excellent,Even Martha Stewart recommended this item on her show. I can only agree it's the Cadillac of rice cookers. Excellent!
3,Only adequate for the money,I purchased this rice cooker based on the reviews that I had read and honestly it only does an adequate job considering the cost.I have yet to produce Batsami rice that doesn't come out like mush from it. I have used two different brands of rice and have the same problem each time. White rice and some of the other brown rices come out perfect but not the Batsami. I have read that other less expensive cookers perform just as adequatly without the high dollar tag.It sure does look good sitting on my counter though...
5,Excellent rice cooker,You can't beat Zojirushi quality. This rice cooker is excellent at making rice and hot cereals. The 3 cup size is just right for up to 4 people. And takes very little counter space. Set it and forget it!
1,Not stainless steel,I bought this rice cooker thinking it was stainless steel - it is Not stainless steel. The cooking surface is a non stick coating (probably teflon). I returned the item.
5,Love it.,"For many years, I considered a rice maker as I enjoy rice a few times a week but felt I did fine cooking it on the stovetop. It was easy. But eventually I decided to try one. This one had good ratings so I went for it. It's an amazing little appliance. Set it to go and relax. Your rice may take a little more time to cook than on the stove but it doesn't need your constant attention. It will be perfectly cooked, warm and waiting for you. I like this cooker so much I just bought a second one for my daughter to take back to school with her. I highly recommend this one."
3,Fitting review for a fitting,It's a fitting. The fitting fits the hole it is threaded into. Color was a bit more purple than blue. Does not match the rest of the blue Earls stuff I have on the motor. Oh well it still works better than an ugly steel fitting that was straight. The angle was what was key.

3,"great handle, OK tool","This tool would work best in soil with no rocks. If you have to trench into dry, gravel or compacted soil buy a real pick. Nice handle not commonly found on mass produced tools of today. Light tool as well of you not too physically strong."
2,2 months.............,this thing lasted two months exact...... i was careful with my computer and only charged it when it needed to be charged and one day out of the blue DONE ........ no more will it work... extremely dissapointed and when i tried to look at returning it......... i find out that i am a month late......... great..........
4,Great Adapter for an Excellent Price,"This HP adapter is well worth the money. The adapter tip fits a little loosely into my laptop, but once I twist the cord it stays in just fine. Great value for the money!"
4,It works!,Its appearance was disconcerting. It does not look like an original power supply. The vendor provided an adaptor and had installed it before I got it. Very nice. It has been in service a few weeks and seems to be doing fine.
2,"Kindle Version: Give Us Something Better, Please","This review relates only to the Kindle version.All of the book's content is included. But the publisher did a poor job of converting the text for the Kindle format. The images scale weird. And the side-bar content is randomly inserted in bizarre locations (they don't align with the print book nor do they align with the content for which they support).This poor treatment (by the publisher) seems unacceptable to me. Especially when you consider that the price for the Kindle version is nearly identical to the print book.--Using a Kindle 3G Wireless with the 6"" Display (3rd generation)"
2,to weak,"I wanted this to read by in an area we had not gotten overhead light to yet.Not enough light to read by, Not focused enough. Probably good for low level light in a tent."
4,"Decent reading, especially for a movie tie-in project","Sure, it is a movie tie-in, and I suspect its release was timed to build the hyper for the Blair Witch sequel, but The Secret Confession of Rustin Parr is actually a satisfying, quick mystery/horror novel. I admire the author for keeping it short and sweet, for not overextending the material.It's a pretty basic plot: Rustin Parr admitted to the murder of seven children in Burkittsville, Maryland in 1941. He was a hermit, anyway. Sentenced to be hanged, he confessed a shocking truth to a priest named Dominick Cazale on the night before his execution. Cazale doesn't reveal the truth until he is own his own deathbed, 60 years later, as a result of a tragic house fire.As with the Blair Witch movies, the twists and the ending of this novel tie-in are ambiguous and open to interpretation. Recommended to any horror fan."
3,real work,The first thing is that this book only gives hours so you have to come up with a rate and ship builders are reluctent to give you that. you will still need rs means to get a complete estimate. It does cover repairs that nobody else has. it is not great but it is useful.
5,Great Product,"I being hard of hearing and evean with hearing aids I need the TV to loud for the comfornt of others in the room, These sloved the problem, Not only do they give me the level of sound i need they also have great clarity I can understant the dialog even with a loud back ground music in the movie, the frequency range is fabulouis, the soft cussion earpiece reduces the room noise nicely."
2,Decent sound but too fragile - breaks way to easily,"So the first set I bought sounded great and I loved them. Unfortunately, as noted by other reviewers, they break easily, right at the swivel that joins the cans to the headband. I tried (like any man would) to fix them with duct tape, but then the broken can would no longer completely cover the ear. So I finally bit the bullet and bough a second pair. Two months later, and I am now the proud owner of TWO broken headsets. I take care not to treat pricey headphones roughly, but these don't survive normal usage. Not for me or a lot of the other reviewers."
1,Poor Choice-stay away,"I purchased these and they worked very well . . . but the headset broke within 2 months. I replaced it with another and those broke exactly the same way as the first set after only a few weeks. I am very careful and treat my equipment with great care, but this headset is shoddily made . . . very poorly constructed.I'm definitely not going for a third set . . . throwing good money after bad. Steer clear of these cheapie, badly-designed, poorly constructed waste of money."
1,Bad product,"I got those for my bday, had several issues before the transmitter unit finally stopped working.1- blocked my wireless connection in the house, which meant if I am watching a movie, no one can use the wireless Internet , this occurred with 2 different broadband routers and the latest one was a dual band. Tried LTB tech support but no answer2- the bass came out choppy with high def content3- base is not working any more4- the only good thing is battery life, but I will not give LTB any credit for that"
5,MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL BLACK GREEKS!!! A++++++,"I really enjoyed this movie! It was like an old time fable that my gran used to tell me back in the day. Just how the story unfolded. Although it is a touchy subject of sorority hazing, I STILL GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP even though it resembled the real life alpha kappa alpha sorority but the box stated a true story or inspired by a true story. I went to an HBCU and this movie is dead on! Especially in the era that it was set. My review is objective, I can be subjective and get upset because I am in a black greek org as well but that does not take away that BIG WALT is the man! His black greek books are over the top and I love them and I love this movie too! Finally, my recommendation greatly! YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! I have not ever seen a black sorority or even fraternity movie that can even come close to the real life nature of this movie. Much Props!"
1,boring and lazy,"I became a fan of Palahniuk when I read, Choke, one of the funniest books I've ever come across. Then reading ""Survivor"" furthered my affection for this author, however after reading the synopsis' of most of his other works I just couldn't find myself willing or interested enough to pick up said other works.Stranger than Fiction did spark my interested and I was dupped into reading the majority of this trash, oddly enough, none of which is stranger than fiction."
3,Mixed bag - worth reading selectively,"I'd have to agree with other reviewers who have commented that this is uneven. There are 5-8 good stories here, which makes it worth reading. Most of the others are easy enough to ditch quickly that you know within a page or two whether or not to continue. And, the better stories are in the ""people together"" section which is the first part of the book. It mostly goes downhill after that.The same ones other reviewers here have called out as good I'll mention: demolition derby, amateur wrestling, castle building were the highlights. Juliette Lewis and Marylinn Manson (excuse me if I haven't taken the time to learn to spell that name right) are the memorable lowlights. There were other more boring stories but those two stood out as bad.BTW, if you have any aversion to porn or obscenity, skip the first story but don't pass on the whole book because of it."
3,Interesting,"What I like about this book is the boldness, which is pretty much true for all of Palahniuk's work.It's fascinating knowing these are true events and really makes you see some of what has influenced his storytelling."
2,"""after fight club, the volume gets tuned down(...)""","...Well, the same could be said of Mr Palahniuk's inspiration lately.Here is a compilation of his writing which reads more like articles than essays : demolition, castles, marilyn manson, hollywood, ghosts, etc... it's more of a bazaar. Gonzo journalism somehow...I skipped a lot of chapters just like i pick the juicy parts in my newspaper.I enjoy very much Mr Palahniuk novels, but it's not because you have talent and you sell, that you must publish everything you write.If you're a fan, you'll buy it anyway.Otherwise, wait until it's in paperback or get it at your local library. The price is defenitly not worth it. His Portland, Oregon guide is at least much more fun to read."
2,Rather Dry,"I have a problem getting into books if they dont grab me right away. Call me simplistic, but Harry Potter books catch my attention right away.This book, is probably the worst of his so far. I was expecting short stories...not what was the length of a newspaper story. When I saw the book I noticed three distinct sections. I thought to myself, nice..three short stories. I read the first ""chapter"" and then started the second. I was like..wait. Was that a story? What happened?When I think of short stories I think of Poe. Shorter than a whole book but enough to get you involved. I have read the first 3 or so ""chapters so far and I am about to give up on it. There is not enough meat and bones to this one.Like others said..this is no Lullabye, Fight Club, or the like. If you are interested in this book...ask me, I'll sell you my copy."
4,A good book,"A composite of real world odditities, experiences and interviews. Different than his novels, but interesting."
5,5100 stickers!,"I thought these seemed a bit expensive when I ordered them, but when I got them I was really surprised by how many stickers came in the package. It's 51 sheets of stickers, with 100 stickers per sheet. This may be a lifetime supply for our house. You get 3-4 sheets of each theme and there are several different stickers for each theme on a sheet."
4,A good start,"Those readers who dare not venture into the thicket of controversial rhetoric blanketing the Arab-Israeli Conflict had best start with this slim pamphlet, which serves as thumbnail history of post-Ottoman/post-colonial Middle East, Zionism, and four generations of strife and state creation.Meanwhile, the authors pause occasionally to note disagreement among their sources, highlighting forks in the socially constructed path of Arab-Israeli history.This book is best used to help you decide what book you should read next on this difficult but important topic. But if you don't know much about the Arab-Israeli Conflict and have questions about current crises, reading this book alone will provide a quick and valuable lesson, up to but not including the 2006 Summer Lebanon War."
5,Wonderful resource!,I love this book! As a new mom there are lots of things that are not intuitive for me yet. This book really helped!
5,Our first grill,"Choosing our first grill really was a simple decision. We knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while. Weber was the only way to go in our minds. Now that we own this grill I can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we don't use it!I'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer. This grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy. And for the two of us, this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained. Highly recommended!"
2,Texas,Was not as promoted (very good condition--and I even asked if it was suitable for a gift)--yellowing pages and frayed a little
2,Should be edited again,"I found numerous typos and redundancies that proved to be quite distracting.While the overall premise of the book was interested and worth exploring, the lack of quantitative data was disappointing. The personal stories have some currency, it was difficult to extrapolate these to create greater meaning."
2,The Author is not childless,"You can't possibly know what it means to be childless today when you are not childless today. The author describes in the book, a nightmare she had in which she dreams she has no children and awakes in a panic and runs down the hall to find her child sleeping. HUH!? The author has no credibility and nothing to offer."
5,"Fun topic, great book","If you have any interest in reliving your gaming past on Apple ][s, or old Nintendos or Ataris, you will love this book. The book has recipes for emulating all of those consoles and even building and hacking your own hardware. I really enjoyed reading this book."
4,"7744, an excercise in spazzcore.","Apparently, the common misconception is that As The Sun Sets is a grindcore band, which, they are most certainly not. Some people even seem to feel that ATSS is a metalcore band. They do resemble the metalcore sound, so this album will satisfy the tastes of metalcore fans as well, but in actuality they are a spazzcore band in it's truest form. If you purchase this album under the impression that it will deliver what Discordance Axis or Pig Destroyer will, you'll be dissapointed. However, for fans of Converge and other spazzcore, 7744 is an album which gives the listener unbelievably heavy moments of intense screaming and pounding drumwork, but does not fail to bring melody and creativty to a sound which could otherwise be considered tiring. All in all a praiseworthy and unique album, definately a must for fans of a heavy and unique sound, not for fans of pure grindcore. For a more polished sound, check out ATSSs sophmore effort, Each Individual Voice Is Dead."
4,WAY GOOFY HITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Perhaps, my favorite song on this CD would have to be the Monster Mash!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just love listening to it anytime:Here's how I would rate this:1. Monster mash- 5 stars- positively the best song!!!!2. Tip Toe Thru the Tulips With Me- 3 stars- very corny and fun!!3. Long Tall Texan- 4 stars4. Lil Red Riding Hood- 4 stars5. Troglodyte- 4 stars6. Junk food junky- 4 stars7. Ahab, the arab- 3 stars8. Surfin Bird- 4 stars9. Splish Splash- 5 stars- another fun song!!!!10. Let it out- 3 stars11. The Jolly green Giant- 4 stars12. Leader of the pack- 5 stars- fun for driving!!"
5,Works well,"What can I say, it's a flash card. But it seems to be fast and holds a ton of shots. I'm happy with it."
5,For my dad's dog,"My father absolutely loves this for his dog. His dog has a heated doghouse, but couldn't put the water bowl in, because she would turn it over. Now my father doesn't have to worry about the water being frozen. Also bought a temperature controlled outlet so the water isn't heated unless it needs to be."
3,"Nice, but water freezes when down to the single digits.",I like the bowl. Using it for birds in the winter. It is not good down to 20 below. Not even close. How could it be at only 25 watts. Water freezes when below around 12 degrees. Other than that it seems good.
2,not what it shows,"I order this produt but didnt recived all of what it shows in the picture, the wall to camcorder adaptor. did not come with. ( the one on the upper left corner)"
5,great album,"this is a great album. go out and buy it now. Here are my song ratings:1) Downfall: first single off the album. starting to get tired of listening to it 9/102) Falling Apart: great gong, but not the best 9/103) Hover: my favorite song off the album 10/104) Running From Me: second single off the album 9/105) Slipping Away: great verses 9/106) Figure 8: didnt like it at first, but now i love it 10/107) The Fear: third single from the album; a little softer than the rest of the songs 10/108) Deeper Into You: my 2nd favorite song on the album 10/109) Drop to Zero: decent song 9/1010) Finally: my least favorite song, but still ok 8/1011) Take It All: a lot like Downfall 10/10"
3,Buy if you like Linkin Park,The first thing you will notice is that these guys sound like Chester Bennington of Linkin Park. So whether you will want to buy this CD is dependent on whether you like that soound. Also I think that the best two and most distinguishable tracks are the first two (Downfall and Falling Apart). It was very hard for me to distinguish the rest of the songs from one another. Not enough variety and range I am afraid.
3,"eh, not that great but it is worth a listen or 2.","im not a huge trust co fan but they do have potential to be huge, just not on this record. i like to listen to this every now and then because i rarely ever listen to this cd. the only worth while thing about the band is there bass player. the singer isnt bad but he sounds like a school girl in some of the songs and the band is lacking creativity. they were big for awhile but then it seemed like they just disappeared off the face of the earth. however im looking forward to there sophomore cd TRUE PARELLELS which sounds like its going to be very good , but who knows it could end up like this cd. i just really wish i could get into them but as for now ill stick to more new bands like 3 days grace, 3doors down, chevelle, incubus, queens of the stone age, crossfade etc..."
5,Not the hardest cd out..but one of the best!,"I heard ""Downfall"" on the radio and loved it. I never buy a cd unless I heard at least two songs off of it...but I took a chance and ""The Lonely Position of Neutral"" is an awesome cd!!.""Running From You"", ""Hover"", ""Drop to Zero"" and ""Finally"" and the best songs on the cd. I listen to these songs ever time I put it in my cd player and then I listen to the whole cd. It is one of the best cds I have!! I am a hard rock guy and this is just a rock cd...but a great rock...put it up today!!!!!!!!!"
1,Terrible!,"This portable DVD has a poor quality, I bought it one year ago and right now is not working. One day stop to work. I used it in my car for my baby, I never move it from my car and right know I need to expend more money to buy another one.As an advice: buy the less expensive portable DVD they will stop to work in one or two years. These are disposable electronics."
1,Gloria is a boring spoiled brat,"I wanted to like this book. I put off reading it for a couple weeks in anticipation. I was extremely disappointed. Other reviewers have made a big deal about the fact the author is male (details to clothing etc). No one has said anything about Gloria having little more personality than a plastic doll. She is extremely selfish. We never find out the root of her roommates religion, or why Gloria suddenly decides they are friends. We never find out what happened to her friend from her writing class. The book flips back and forth between time periods and different characters' points of view; I think it would've been much more effective to stick with Gloria. I wish she was more sympathetic. It was impossible for me to root for her, or feel any emotion about anything that happened to her. Many parts were overly descriptive, and I found myself skimmimg paragraph after paragraph. A big disappointment."
1,Weakling!,"After reading so many positive reviews here, I got this to replace a Cuisinart knife that had popped its clogs after years of heavy use. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a real lightweight. The blades are flimsy and have trouble with the simplest tasks, like slicing bread. I'm going back to this one:Cuisinart CEK-40 Electric Knife."
4,Impressed!,"For those of you that are looking for an inexpensive electric knife, well...look no further!I just received my knife this past weekend, and it looked really nice. I haven't used it yet, but it seems like it will do a really good job in carving my future prime rib roasts. I plugged it in, let it and ran it a couple of times, and it was smooth. (However, when I do use the knife, I might lubricate in between the blades with a drop or two of cooking oil.) The blades were sharp, and I didn't see any of the ""gap"" between the blades that most of the reviewers wrote about. (They must have received a bad batch or something.)I would definitely recommend this item to my family and friends, it's a very useful, and for the price, it can't be beat."
1,Broke immediately,"This is a piece of junk. There's a little plastic piece in there that broke as soon as we tried to use it. I noticed other reviews complaining about the same thing, but there don't seem to be ANY good electric knives (judging by the reviews) sold on Amazon! Save your money and go buy one locally. At least that way it will be easier to return it if it breaks."
2,Poorly-Designed Trigger Mechanism,"The first time my wife used this knife we discovered that to turn it on takes two hands: one hand to hold the knife and trigger and the other to press the safety lock. This safety mechanism makes the knife awkward to use because if you want to stop between slices (e.g., to position the meat or remove slices), you have to use both hands to restart the knife. While the knife slices well, this knife is over-designed for safety (like a lot of things in our over-litigious society)!"
4,Worked great for cutting foam,"Used this for cutting memory foam and cushion foam. This cuts through those like crazy easy!HOWEVER the trigger lock is a PITA. It's difficult to activate and makes me want to remove it. But it's a safety feature, so uh... don't want to remove it. So the trigger is quite annoying to use. Once you get it going though it's awesome.The blades are REALLY sharp already, and then it's electric! I'm going to try and get a second set of blades so I can use it on the Thanksgiving turkey! hah.Overall satisfied, but the trigger safety design sucks!"
2,It's not battery operated and it's not very powerful,"Somehow, when I purchased this, I thought it was battery operated, which is what I was looking for. It's not very powerful, but it is small and easy to clean."
1,It is Junk,"I bought this knife at Christmas, opened it to carve a roast beef on Easter Sunday... it worked for about 1.5 minutes then stopped working. Don't waste your money on this lousy product."
3,Hard to Use,"This knife did effectively cut a turkey, but it vibrates enough that it is very hard to control safely. I also found that it was unable to cut through anything much tougher than a turkey."
1,junk.,"I bought this knife less than 6 months ago. I used it mainly to slice homemade loaves of bread. Yesterday it started smoking, got very hot and quit working. I loved it while it worked, but it just didn't last. Sad. Now I am on the hunt for another one. Won't buy this brand again."
1,Easier to use a manual knife,I bought this to replace a Cusinart knife that died after 10 years. I use it to slice homemade bread but it has difficulty getting through the loaf. It requires some much pressure to cut that I usually just give up and switch to my Henkel bread knife because it is less tiring
2,Quality it's not,"Seems its all about the money you can get, and pride in a quality product is no longer a business practice. I would much prefer to pay more for a product from a company that believed in quality control, and not only mass production of a cheap product."
2,WAY too noisy!,"I bought this knife to replace a roughly 20 year old model which is the same design as this one. The blades lost their plastic blade guards, the blades weren't as sharp and I couldn't get new blades.This new knife is very noisy and not as easy to control as the old one. I like the offset blades but that is about the only thing I like about it. The old knife came with short blades as well as the normal long ones. The new EK700 only has long blades.Even though the little plastic blade guards have fallen off the old knife blades, I've gone back to using that knife. This purchase was not a success."
3,Not quite what I expected after reading reviews,"After reading all of these reviews, I expected wonderful things out of this item. I purchased it to slice cured bacon. It does not slice cured bacon at all. So if you want to cut 'tough' food items, find another way."
1,not good,"I own a 10 year old black & decker electric knife that I really like. When I saw these at such a good price I ordered two. One for me and one for my brother in law for Christmas. I tried to carve our turkey with mine but could nog get knive to stay turned on. You have to push a small, spring loaded, pin that blocks trigger from being pushed in to turn on. You need to almost look at small pin to push it across then before you can start cutting it snapps back and turns off. To get my turkey carved, I had to take a knife and cut the safety pin off. Then the knife works great with no safety pin. I just have to remember to unplug it before trying to remove blades. I will have to update my brother in law about his gift."
5,Best Foam Cutter ever.,"I'm an Audio Engineer. I deal with lots of Anvil style ATA rated flight cases. These cases occasionally come with foam glued inside them. Sometimes that foam doesn't fit what I need to put in the case. Enter ""EK700"".This thing cuts foam like a dream. The rounded tip doesn't jab into the wood case, and the knives slice clean. My cuts look like they came right from the factory.Probably works for food as well, but I give it 5 stars a a foam cutter."
1,not what I expected,Was very excited to at last have an electric knife. When product arrived it looked as if it had been preused. During the first use the blade quit. What a disappointment. Would not buy again.
1,The Wrong Greg Long!!!,This is NOT the Contemporary-Christian artist Greg Long. This is NOT the Greg Long that sings with the group Avalon. This is obviously a musician and not a singer!! Be sure not to confuse the two.
5,Very High Quality,I purchased this bag for a large tripod. The material is thick and appears durable with a high quality zipper. I fold the internal padding down making one large compartment with extra padding on the bottom. I have no idea of how well it would work as a mount and telescope case - though I'd be hesitant to put such items together in one bag.
4,Good for those not used to exercise,"I would give this 4.5 stars if that were an option. This workout would be great for people not used to working out. I got it because I was looking for something to supplement my other cardio and weight training workouts. It is a little too basic for me, but if you get a tape that is supposed to be just walking/jogging, what do you expect? The instructor is not annoying and cues well. The background is nice and soothing. My only real problem with the workout is that there is NO warm up or cool down stretching. Besides that, I recommend the workout. I will keep it in the mix on days I don't have much energy to do my other workouts or may even put it on while watching TV."
2,Very dissapointed,"I have other workouts from Leslie Sansone. I have recommended them to my friends. This one in particular I thought was challenging. Not challenging at all. I didn't even sweat. Very short, not good."
2,Could be better!,"Although the workout itself is pretty good on this DVD...I was disappointed that Leslie chose to use the same members (with the mix-matched outfits) that she used on her Walk and Kick DVD in that same dark, dreary setting. It really makes it hard to get into the workout when the scenery is so bad. And the quality of the DVD is terrible. At certain times the faces are blurred. I don't know if I just got a bad copy or this is actually the way it is. I made the decision to buy this DVD and the Walk and Kick DVD based on the wonderful reviews I had read. I wish some of the reviews had mentioned the quality of the DVD, the setting and the way the members are dressed. I doubt I will do this workout again...so that's yet another item for the next yard sale."
3,"Good solid workout, but nothing new","As far as the work out itself goes- it is a solid well rounded Leslie Walk, and I really like the ""boosting"" which is just jogging, but I wouldn't consider this a must have in your Leslie collection. The production quality isn't that great, and she doesn't give the cue's to move into the next move as well. You can still follow this easily- you just really have to be watching her.It is just one work out so you do not get the value some of her other DVD's have where you have a few different complete options to choose from.Bottom line- if you are looking to fill out your Leslie collection and just want to add this, it is not a bad workout. But if you are starting out and might want a more limited # of her videos, and want more value with more than one workout on a disc, skip it."
3,Leslie Sansone Walk Away Ponds,"For the price, the DVD was too short. Only had one 30 minute exercise session. I have purchased several DVD's by Leslie, this is the only one that dissapoints."
4,Walk away the pounds walk and jog,This is quite a good workout it takes about 30 minutes and it is the equivelant of a 2.5 mile walk which is not bad. This workout is great if you have limited time to exercise as it really gets your heart rate up and gets you sweating you really feel as if you have had a workout. I would definitely recommend this one.
3,"Good quality, misleading size","I bought this grate to use as a cooking grate for a different brand of grill which really needed a 16.75 inch grate but this one is the closest I could find and will ""work"". Although it is designed as a charcoal grate I seasoned it with oil as I would season a cast iron pot and I expect it will hold up well for many years.That said I think both Weber and Amazon need to provide better size information. While it is manufactured for the Weber series the size listed on the item and the size listed in Amazon are just plain wrong. The actual size of the grate is 17 inches diameter, not 16.5 as Amazon states and not 22.5 as Weber states. It would be nice if the details provided in the description were accurate."
3,It's a Brush,"Two problems present themselves with this brush.1- The small round groove on the tip of the brush is ineffective on the square grill grates on my grill which is also a Weber grill. It's a pretty wimpy little scraper if you ask me.2- Most grill brushes I have ever used are curved at the end so you can fully utilize all of it's brass bristles. This grill brush has a slight curve at the brush end but not enough of a curve to make a difference to use it effectively, especially at the back side of the grill."
4,strudy and reliable,The grill brush is not only well made but made to last. It is a practical gift for the man of the BBQ.
3,BE CAREFUL!,"Weber grill brushes are great. Their brass bristles are softer than stainless steel and do not scratch. BUT, make sure you are buying the ""original"" Weber brush. I ordered this from ANTonline, but they pulled a bait-and-switch; shipping an inferior substitution to me, and I'm having trouble getting a 100% refund that includes shipping cost. Buyer beware! Only buy from a known, reputable retailer! And, only buy authentic Weber brushes."
5,Retro 70 s,"Retro 70 s various artists, 16 songs on this one! all original recordings !! good tunes /good price.. I am very pleased w/this buy!"
2,Baby Alive Doll Food,Overall I really love this product. I even had a Baby Alive doll myself when they first came out in the seventies. They are much nicer now. The only reason I would not give this item great ratings accross the board is because buying the food can get really expensive. The doll is really fun to play with so kids like to feed it several times a day. That can get really pricey. I know some people use food coloring and water as a substitute but that does not have the baby food consistency that the kids love. The best recipe I have found so far uses a health food item. [...]
3,Messy and not needed,We bought this thinking it would be great and it wasn't not at all and I was disappointed. The doll spit it out and it was everywhere. I have three kids and do not need a freaking doll to clean up after too.
2,Broke...,"I got this item for my husband for Christmas, 2006. By March the scroll wheel had broken (does not work in any computers), and by May the entire mouse died. Not recommended."
4,"It's a lovely mouse, but it's not made 4 Vista.","i like this mouse, & i use it now. It was weird that when i got it, Vista told me it was unfit, but i found an update at MS website & it's working ok on vista."
1,Worst Mouse I've Ever Used,"This mouse never worked right. It was sluggish compared to even older microsoft intellipoints. It sticks all of the time in Counter Strike, the mod for half life. And if it sticks in Counter Strike, you can only imagine what kind of problems it has with Warcraft III, UT23K and other high end games. On my particular model, the left click button stopped working. The mouse wheel is easily jammed. Not worth the trouble. Go for a logitech"
4,This Mouse is good but has no balls,I like the Microsoft Optical Blue Mouse. The only negative is that the mouse buttons make an audible click. Took me a couple of days to get used to that. Overall a very nice mouse.
4,A good solid no frills mouse,"I like this mouse. It replaced my factory Dell mouse that kept screwing up. It feels pretty nice, the buttons have a nice feel to them and the scroll wheel has a got a nice movement to it. It also has an attractive appearance. Most importantly, the mouse moves the pointer where I want it to go without any hassle. Probably not the absolute best mouse out there, but if you just want a good solid reliable mouse for a reasonable price and that's a little nicer looking than appliance white I'd get this one."
5,Works perfectly!,"This grill is exactly what I'd hoped it would be. Hosted a BBQ for 30 people on this thing and it performed wonderfully. Good tight seal on the lid. Had to the close the vents and lid on a flare-up and it successfully trapped the smoke inside and suffocated the flame quite nicely.The pan wasn't as much of a problem as I had feared, the ash wasn't blowing around like crazy (although I imagine it could on a very windy day) and the pan sits very securely in position using the clips provided. I definitely recommend this."
5,A Classic,"Weber is the classic. This is my 4th or 5th 22.5"" One-Touch and it appears that each time they're slightly better. While the wooden handles are missed, the plastic/rubber (aka: nylon) handles work fine and don't crack and rot. The Weber does cost more but my abused kettle generally lasts us about a decade - the first thing that `dies' is the One-Touch ash cleaner - it just rusts (if you don't use a grill cover). Other than that, it's a solid product and after years and years of use, the grill and coal tray can be easily replaced. Don't settle for an imposter and do buy a cover!"
2,nuthin' to write home about,"As for being a Weber product the construction could have been sturdier. The legs are light, wheels are cheap so you have to be careful when moving the grill, it can be a bit top heavy if you have anything in it. The charcoal grate grid spacing is a bit wide so I had to put another one on top to prevent unspent coals from dropping through. Weber could have just put in the hinged cooking grate instead of the flat one. Also, you have to jury-rig the ash catcher. For the money, Weber could have done better. I am disappointed in this product just because it's a Weber and I don't feel that they lived up to their reputation. I'm glad I didn't go for the gold."
5,"Weber silver the large model, I love it","Great grill it burns hot, cook quick,good buy I'm thoughly please with mine."
5,Great quality,It's a good buy and the same price as I've seen anywhere else. It also shipped for free... Works for me without having to go to the store : )
3,Why is Amazon selling all these good items through Pro-Max Supply?,"Having already been burned by Pro-Max, I wish that Amazon would at least give us the option of purchasing products from a more reliable seller. Formerly called ""Crazy Dave's Toolshed,"" and now operating under the name of ""Pro-Max,"" those bozos can't even handle a simple order like a box of staples. I'll be darned if I'm going to trust them to ship something like this fine Weber grill. Guess I'll have to buy elsewhere unless Amazon wises up and gives ""Pro-Max"" the boot."
5,Weber Kettle Grill,"I love my Weber Kettle Grill. I had a large butane grill, but it just didn't give the food the good charcoal flavor that my Weber does. My Weber is a lot easier to store and keep clean than that large monster of a grill I used to have. I purchased it from Amazon and got the best price around! It was at my front door in 2 days! I am so happy with it and with Amazon! I even got free shipping and that made it cheaper than if I had bought it at a store like WalMart."
5,Great Grill,Easy to put together and cooks very well. Also has a nice ash disposal system for cleaning out the ashes. I liked the idea of being able to close it up after cooking and saving the briquets for the next cookout.
5,Wish i bought gas,Great grill but we are just lazy and it doesn't get as much use as if we would've bought a gas one.
1,DON'T BUY THIS DOLLHOUSE!,"I am 13 and i still play with dolls but what i haven't done in a long time is cry yah that's right i cried hystarically when i received this for christmas last year.i was so dissappointed because THE ROOMS ARE SO INCREDIBLY SMALL there is no room in them.why would you want to waist your money on a dollhouse where the rooms are so small you cant put any furniture in them except for the babie's cribs?i know that this house is called twin time but it's literally called that because its only for twins and nobody else in your childs pretend family.why waste your money on a house thats only for babies? thats totally pointless!if i were you i wouldnt buy this dollhouse,i reccomend buying the sweet edition townhous,and if you buy it you wont have to suffer watching your child cry because she wasnt expecting a dollhouse only fo babies!"
4,Thermodynamics,"I agree that the book, Thermodynamics by J.P. Holman is anexcellent book to study the aspects of Thermodynamics. I amemployed with an aircraft company and I am tasked to provideinstructions to certain employees to study Thermodynamics. Itwould be much easier if the book was published with answers tothe homework questions. The book deserves a five star ratingbut it is compromised, in my opinion to four stars."
5,Look no further!,"This is a must have for all fair skinned ladies out there. I am extremely pale, though the medium is perfect. My friends were shocked that I didnt have any orange streaks even using the medium. It really does simply look like I have been tanning. LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and will never look to another product."
1,Can you say Oompa-Loompa,"I have orange, somewhat streaked legs after using this one time. I LOVE Dove energy glow, but they stopped making it and now you can only find it at outrageous prices. I am on the hunt to find the next best thing and this is not it."
3,Want something darker,"I bought this because reviewers liked it. Actually, I think I got confused and thought I was getting the bronzer, which supposedly gives a darker color, but also leaves a little glitter. I wondered about the glitter. So when this arrived, I was surprised (& glad) it had no glitter, and then I saw the bronzer in a store and realized I ordered the wrong one. This seems to have a tad more color than the face version, which I also purchased and am very disappointed in. I use it nearly every day and while I think it is keeping my arms, neck and chest somewhat with color, I am waiting to use it up so I can purchase the bronzer."
3,Seems like a good idea,"Admittedly I don't do indirect grilling much at all, but I do like to add soaked wood chips on top of my charcoal just before grilling and though this might be an easy solution to removing the very hot grate. Honestly the hinge openings aren't big enough to do much of anything and became more of a pain than anything else. If you do indirect grilling this might be worth the money, but I would probably figure out another way to add more charcoal."
1,What a joke,"How can anyone like this stuff, it is absolutely trite and boring. C'mon folks lets go the distance with music and stop placing our heels in the sand"
4,Really Good Rap/Rock Album,"I Think Devil Without A Cause Was A Really Good Album And If You Get The Clean Version You Can Play It In The Car With Your Kids And It Makes Random Noises Whenever He Cusses Not A ""Bleep"" Because That Would Be Boring Not My Favorite Kid Rock Album I Lean Towards His Southern Rap Country My Favorite Is Cocky But Devil Without A Cause Is My Favorite All Rap Album By Him My Personal Favorites Would Have To Be On The Album ""Bawitdaba"" And ""Cowboy"" And I Also Enjoyed The Title Track And ""I Am The Bullgod"" The Shipping Was Great I Ordered It Late February And It Came Really Early I Mean Really Early In March And I Got What I Paid For So Overall I Highly Recommend This Album To My Friends And Family And The Kids So I Think You Should Buy ""Devil Without A Cause"""
3,Not too bad,"I like this product, but after I purchase,it told me No. 70014 ACCO Compressor for use with these fastener bases (sold separately). Next time, plz tell us before we purchase it."
1,This is not a Philip Pullman's trilogy!!!,"After reading all the previous reviews, I was very excited to buy the Pullman's trilogy in one book for my son. What I received was a dramatization BASED ON Philip Pullman's trilogy. The cover of the book has two lines on a bottom saying: BASED ON THE NOVELS BY PHILLIP PULLMAN, ADAPTED BY NICHOLAS WRIGHT, which are missing from the image on this page.I am really confused. Are we talking about the same book? Mine looks exactly like the one on the top of this page."
3,'Just Us Girls' Book Review,"The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed this book in February '04. The group felt that the book started out slow but it was an easy read.The group identified `serpents' (pg. 43 & 253) - Al Majors, Sebastian and Reynolds. The group discussed if Hennessy could be considered a `serpent'. But a `serpent' was defined in the book as someone who is close to you and intentionally trying to hurt you. The group agreed that Hennessy did not intentionally try to hurt Tristan and once she got to know him she fell in love with him.The group did feel that Hennessy was not a believable FBI agent. She did not portray or demonstrate the strength as a trained agent. The group did not feel the author did a sufficient amount of research on what the actually FBI training entails.The group also felt the ending was a disappointment. What will the future hold for Tristan and Hennessy?? Will there be room for a sequel?"
2,Disappointing,"Far from being a definitive collection of illustrations of the ancient world as it was, this is a vastly overpriced volume filled with mediocre reconstruction's {some computer created, some not} supported by adequate text. You will find the average National Geographic archaeological article featuring far richer reconstruction's of the past than this work. Only for the most dedicated builder of an archaeological library."
3,Compelled to compile,3 1/2Pleasant refresher course in older Metheny isn't a must-own compilation but can still be a revelation for fans ignorant of earlier acoustic success.
1,Melted in a matter of minutes,"I was so excited to receive my Smokey Joe, the positive reviews also guaranteed that the Smokey Joe would be a great buy. We assembled and realized that all of the washers (seals) were missing, but it assembled well nonetheless. We lit the coals and to my horror, after burning a few minutes, the bottom cover melted and fell out! It proved useless for smoking the food as there were open holes in the grill. It seems I got a defective product."
3,Handle gets way too hot because it is located almost on top of the top vent,"First of all let me say that I WOULD BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN and that I do recommend it.Here is the big butt ...The dome lid is so small that in order to find somewhere to place the top air vent, it was installed almost directly under the handle.Also since the lid is not all that high, it is very close to the flames.Bottom line is that the lid handle can NOT be used unless you have a hot pad or hot glove.A better design would have been to have TWO SMALLER VENTS equivalent to the ONE LARGE vent.Also note that the lid is not able to rest onto the side of the grill ... better find a place to safely lay it down.The price is right at $29, but I should have considered the 18 inch weber before buying this one.I placed 30 coals on the grate which just did cover the grate 100 %.The temperature maxed out at 450 on the surface of the top grill.I left the coals burn down and it filled to the top the ash tray catcher."
4,"""Great grill""",I chose this rating because this grill is absolutely top of the line for its size! I love the way it cooks the food & had no dislikes! I would highly recomend this grill to anyone! Great product at a great price!
2,"Looks pretty, but small and hard to use","I love how it looks, but now too small for my 10 month old. Only 2 1-oz cubes of baby food fit in each compartment. Also, the lid is very hard to take off. You have to be very careful not to spill the food because it takes lots of pulling to take the lid off. The spoon is easy to use. I will not recommend this lunch box, but will buy more spoons."
2,Paul Gilbert can write better material than this.,"The reviews that are shunning this album do not surprise me. Paul Gilbert always seems to be trying something different once in a while and then coming well off the rails. His solo albums were never a real hit with the Racer X faithful, except a few, but this album again is a diversification away from what the ardent fans really want to hear. I would love Racer X to return to their Eighties heyday and release a blistering album like Second heat again. Energy shred with monster riffs is what Paul Gilbert was always famous for and whilst the previous 2 albums aren't bad, I feel the original magic that made Racer-X one of the best live bands in their heyday just isn't there anymore. I only hope they could get it back. Perhaps Paul Gilbert should look for an additional shredder to join the band because that may be whats missing."
2,Average CD,"First of all I just want to say that Racer X is one of my favorite bands of all time.I have all of their albums and all of them rock.Personally my favorites are Technical Difficulties,SuperHeroes and Second Heat. Even though Getting Heavier doesn't rank up there with the classics,it's far from being a bad album. Songs like Heaven in 74,Dr. X,and Lucifers Hammer just rock.The album in general ain't that bad but nothing really stands out.Most of the songs on the CD are B-sides songs.They're okay but in general the album fails to grab the listener by the throat."
2,Pretty boring game,"I have to admit, being a huge fan of the game show, I was pretty disappointed with the DVD game. Question rounds are ok but take forever to go through. During the game you never know who's in the lead cause the game dosen't show you the leading board. And, we can't really say that you STOP the board when you play.. it's basically pressing enter telling the DVD to go randomly select a prize which might not even be on the board when you pressed the button. Only cool thing, the brand new created whammies animation."
4,Why they hate us,On my journey to determine why America is so hated world wide this was a helpful addition. Walter LaFabers The Inevitable Revoltion is better with the subject of why they hate us but The New Empire gives a good starting foundation for the study of the subject
2,Not the Kindle version,"This is the first ""How To Do It"" Kindle book I have tried. I like that you can enlarge the photos to see details clearly. The thing that is the hang up is that I can NOT see the measurements or the project pieces with measurements well enough to read the numbers or other details. Those parts cannot be enlarged or copied. I tried to copy to MS Word and enlarge. The regular text would enlarge, but the other parts would not. Suggest you not buy the Kindle version until the publisher fixes the formatting."
3,Ok book,Good pics and detailed instructions. Lots of stuff that every workshop needs and you make it all yourself. Makes your shop really become yours
3,Back when Madonna had dark hair,"... and a surname. These photos were taken when she was just 20. She still had some youthful roundness in her face back then, and made the most of that youthfulness in a few ""girl with her kitty"" picturs here. (I'll assume the visual pun was intended.)Some pictures, like the cover shot of M in her longjohns, don't do much for me. (These pictures were taken in New York in February. The longies and conspicuous space heater in a few shots make sense, even if they're not esthetic.) Many of the other poses tend toward the standard. But, when a healthy young woman is involved, even standard poses serve to emphasize the unique features of her face and figure. A few shots close in on her breasts and - well, I've had a girlfriend like that. It's just a way some ladies are.As figure photo, this isn't anything special. Only Madonna's later fame keeps this book in print thirty years after the pictures were taken.-- wiredweird"
5,Fill Er' Up...Duke's Style!,"Tastes like Whiskey, kicks like a mule-- must be moonshine! In this classic Dukes of Hazzard, Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle) has gone against his word and fired up a new a new batch of sipping whiskey. But looks can be downright decieving. What Jesse, Bo (John Schneider) and Luke (Tom Wopat) are cooking up is a substitue for fossil fuels.The Dukes are applying the secret family recipe and distilling a kick-tail ""gasoline"" in order to solve the nation's energy crisis. Of course, that only brings trouble for the Dukes. A federal revenue agent (Carlene Watkins) is doing her best to catch the Duke boys breaking their word and making moonshine. And Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) figures he can collect royalties on the fuel if the Dukes are given a government-funded stay in an iron-bar hotel. With all the heat on can Jesse and the boys make it in time to win the $20000 prize money? Find out and buy this hilarious GAS of an episode!"
5,Great Read!,I thoroughly enjoyed The Other Twin by Hunter Morgan. It kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat. It's the kind of book that makes you keep looking over your shoulder to make sure no one is following you. I can't wait for another book from this author.
4,A very reasonable replacement,"I had the same experience as The Guru. My chrome handle just spun around in a circle, yet I could not remove the set screw to save my life. I ended out destroying the handle and the cartridge to get it off.I chose this H71 handle for my replacement and I am glad that I did. The screw is protected (in the front).If you want to keep it simple and inexpensive, this is a good choice for the 1300/1400 Delta unit."
3,"Great songs, but not the version you're used to","These are good songs and the original singers, but not the version you are used to hearing. But for $5, not bad for the number of songs on the album."
5,GREAT MUSIC,"this album had a lot of songs that were great and I hadn't heard for a while, good mix and well worth the price I paid for it."
3,This not the same grill as the floor model on your deck,"Used for its intended purpose (carried to a picnic table, roadside campsite, or island getaway) this grill is fine. It is not terribly rugged and it takes some fussing to be sure it is stable and level. Nonetheless it allows you to direct cook things in places that your primary grill could never go."
4,portable grill,"Delivered quickly, great price, easy to assemble.But I have not used it yet, plan on using it at the beach house soon."
4,Handy little grill,"This is a great little grill. It is easy to use, easy to clean and cooks enough meat for a family of six. It can be thrown in the back of the car and taken on picnics or for tailgating. Using the small propane bottles makes it easy and hassle-free. It is a great value for the money!"
4,Weber tabletop portable gas grill,"This is our second Weber portable grill.We use this grill in the winter on our patio when our big grill is put away...It works very well on food that we like including chicken breast, steak, and fish fillets. The only fault I have is that the V heat plate wears out rather quickly and it's expensive to replace in the context with the price of the grill. Free Shipping was the determining factor in my purchase."
4,Good Grill - Really Hard to clean,"This grill is really nice and does a job cooking items evenly. My one problem with the grill is the difficulty in cleaning it. I live in an apt. and have nowhere to put this grill except inside my apt. Obviously, this grill is going to smell like meat after grilling so it needs to be thoroughly cleaned unless you have an outside location to leave this grill (I do not). It took me a solid 25-30 minutes to clean this grill so it doesn't smell up my entire apt. Also, the self lighter does not work and you need to put a lighter in the grill itself to light it. These never work I have heard from friends. So to sum up, really good grill, pain in the rear-end to clean if you can't keep the grill outside."
1,weber gas go anywhere grill going back in the box!,"This ""grill"" is an oven in disguise. The first time we used it we left the enclosed large metal insert in place and ruined (baked)$25 worth of T-Bones. On our second attempt to grill on it we removed the large metal insert but the flames were so low that it was still ineffectual as a flamebroiling grill.There went another $20 bucks worth of beef! Not at all the happy grilling experience I remember from years ago with my original weber portable grill."
1,very poor,This product is too small it does not heat up to a properlevel and takes for ever to cook any thing. I would notrecomend it. In fact if I could get my money back I wouldbe glad to return it.
2,Weber Go any where Grill Fails to light,The size and structure of the Weber go anywhere grill was great. But the element did not flicker properly and it would not lite without using a manual lighter therefore I returned it..Amazon was great about the return as long as you returned it within two days you get your money back
1,An Insult to Poetry,"My best advice to you (the prospective reader) would be to consult the complete New York Times Review before even thinking about buying this so-called translation. Mr. Hofstadter has wide-ranging interests, and his enthusiasm is laudable, but it is sadly not married to a disciplined or artistic sensibility. He has no ear for language; he thinks that poetry is merely a matter of sing-song rhythm and relentless rhyme; he has no sense of the magical qualities of certain words in certain combinations. This is an amateur's hack-job of a translation, made more egregious by the arrogance of the translator."
1,A truly misguided translation of a great work,"Hofstadter is a brilliant man, with no ear for poetry. One aspect of human intelligence that computers have some hope of matching is pattern recognition. This, perhaps, has led computer scientist Hofstadter to value pattern (rhyme, meter) in poetry at the expense of sense and, above all, tone. Both in this translation and in his fascinating and infuriating ""Le Ton Beau de Marot"" he shows a near-complete obliviousness to the nuances of tone that words bring with them. Try the Falen translation instead."
3,The 2010 edition,There is no doubt that the contents of the book are as described by several reviews above for the 1993 edition. The 2010 edition is on poor quality paper and the printing is smudged affecting the kind of information you can get from the black and white photos
3,"Bit of a slog, some gems","Just finishing this now, the running narrative is a welcome distraction from the material, which is hit and miss. The second half (more proscriptive) is better in general than the first, which is a pretty tortuous journey though non-Gaussian probability. It is a strange book, the math makes it unapproachable to the layperson, but the colloquial prose makes it a bit tedious as a technical read. Still, there are some good parts, enough that I will likely hang on to it for a while in case I need to refer to them."
4,not as good,"Not as heavy or as good as the 16yr old Weber Gold grill I'm replacing. The lid does not fit as tightly, allowing a lot of smoke\heat loss, no thermometer or tool hook handles as described. Still a weber fan but not the grill it used to be.Why would Amazon have two 22 1/2in gold grills for the same price. Looked at model with thermometer on their website, but accidentally ordered model without a couple of days later, sort of feel taken."
1,Cover does not fit well.,"Cover is about 1/2"" too large for kettle. Because cover does not fit; when you shut off air, all the remaining coals still burn up."
5,Excellent Grill!,"I just picked one up today. I got the floor model from a local store since it was 1/2 price. I already had a basic, beat-up Weber 18.5"" kettle grill that I used occasionally. I got that one for free but always wanted to upgrade to something nicer. I also own a Weber gas grill which I like, but there is nothing like cooking over charcoal or hardwood. My gas grill hasn't been used much lately.This Gold model is such a step above the basic one I had. The hinged grates are wonderful! The ash collection is also great, especially for when it's windy so you don't have hot sparks/ash blowing around and missing the ash ""plate"" on the silver model.I HIGHLY recomend buying this grill or the Platinum model which costs more but offers more extra features, the largest of which is the work surface."
5,Weber One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill - Outstanding,"We had our other Weber 22.5 charcoal grill - for at least 10 years. Now, that we have the Weber 7751001, I can't believe we went so long without it. Cleanup is a breeze. Grill well worth the investment."
5,"works great, a little hard to plug in","no problems with this, except that it was kind of a tight fit for the outlets we used (in France). A little hard to get in and out, but other than that worked perfectly."
5,It's Timeless!,"We first discovered The Green Chili Jam Band in 1996. I played it over & over & over again for my kids (now 14 & 15) W/OUT tiring of the lyrics. It's a lot of fun. Toothless was my personal favorite. When my kids started loosing their teeth, I would tease & sing little bits from the song to them! I have 3 other kids whom I've ""raised"" on the Starfishing Album. The younger ones are now 9, 8 & 4. I have gifted this album to my nieces & have reccommended it to my firends who have young children. Similar to classic children's bedtime stories, this is a timeless album. Although no longer their preferrd choice in music, my teenagers never complain when I put the cd on in the car for the younger ones & I will sometimes catch them singing along! It's original, creative & so much more enjoyable to sing along to than the typical nursery rhymes (row row row ur boat, old mcdonald, twinkle twinkle....)"
4,A Microsoft mouse on an Apple computer?,"Yes, the little blue mouse works perfectly on an iMac running OS X - just plug and play. No need for drivers or special software, just plug it in. I like this over the Apple mouse for several reasons: it's easier to drag and drop files because it's easier to keep the mouse ""clicked"", it has a scroll wheel, it has no cables, and despite with Apple die-hards might have you believe, the second button is sometimes very useful!This mouse works well, and is sensibly priced. Keep your Apple one for when friends are ooh-ing and aah-ing at your new iMac, and keep this one for when you have work to do. Microsoft should seriously think of making a slightly more Apple-styled mouse!"
2,Don't waste your money,"Looks good, but performance leaves a lot to be desired.From the start, the tracking was poor, about on the level of a traditional mouse which needs its trackball cleaning -- jerky and eratic cursor movements.Over time, the left button started to not register a click -- which seems really like a driver problem, because holding the button down does register as a ""button down"", but a click would not work all the time. Very frustrating.Now it had just stopped working altogether, which is sort of good, because now I don't feel so bad about throwing it in the trash and doing what I should have done from the start - buy a Logitech wireless mouse..."
1,really poor performance - don't buy it,"Click switch is too deep and isn't adjustable in any way. On top of all, response to a click is slow. It seemed to work well at first, but after a week the click response took even a second sometimes. I'm returning the product. I SUGGEST YOU NOT TO BUY THIS."
2,you get what you pay for,"This mouse is designed for both right and left handers. That means your left handed friend can use it without lots of pain, but that also means the other 99% of the time you use it with some pain. Its not worth it. If you are right handed go for the asymmetrically designed Intellimouse Explorer. Also, mine would skip, lag, and had other serious technical problems. It got returned..."
5,My favourite album,"This album is even better than the regular release as it has EXTRA TRACKS!!! always a bonus. The extra tracks alone make buying this album worthwhile - written earlier on in their career the bonus tracks are reminiscent of a time when Dan Brown played with the band. The heavy sound of ""At Ease"" and the unusual rendition of ""Sleepwalker"" (you may recognise this one!) along with ""VIP Fast"" (apparently there were two recordings of the song VIP and the word fast should not really be there!) and ""Coolest Kid"" turn this into an awesome album that any Fiction Plane fan just HAS to have in their music collection. It is a major bonus to get the 2 Sisters video included on the album. Of all the releases so far this one is the most versatile musically speaking. Only released in France it is another album that can be hard to get a hold of so grab it while you can!"
1,Careful What You Wish For...,"Definately not as advertised by the manufacturer. Eliminates glare yes but the effect is not unlike frosted glass or blurred vision. Thankfully it comes off with a razor blade and a dry brush -- messy, messy. Serious about glare, invest in anti-glare glass instead, this product is no substitute."
4,A Unique Talent,"""Music for Speeding"" is an instrumental album by the American guitarist Marty Friedman. It was produced by Marty in 2003, and he wrote all the songs. It continues the exploration of progressive rock and Japanese pop music Marty started experimenting with on previous releases. Zero to sixty in three seconds. Marty shifts into high metal gear and never lets up. This album is a great introduction to Marty Friedman, as it successfully displays his influences and is much more rock based than some of his other work, but still clearly shows his soloing style from the 90s. Marty proves once again that he's a unique guitar talent and more than just a metal shredder."
4,empties really fast,"This empties really fast--the whole thing in just a few seconds. Cool. I would probably buy a bigger one next time, just because it's a little smaller than I expected and it does empty so fast. You just start watering and it's done!"
3,Just OK,"This is a merely OK watering can. Nothing phenomenal here. The sprinkler head attaches by friction ... you have to put your own screw into an existing hole. Ideally you will have a correctly sized small screw handy. This is NOT made in Switzerland, but is indicated on the product as being ""Made in USA"". As such, the product description is misleading. Not in a good way. I'm all for the Stars and Stripes, but kind of figured a European product of this sort would have been superior. Again, not a bad product so far, just a plain old plastic watering can."
3,takes getting use to,"Not having briquettes for the gas grill takes some getting use to....flavor bars now.....the jury is still out on, at least in our house.....hope to get use to them....... the grill is a beautiful piece of ""furniture"""
4,grillin,"I have been using small weber grills for years and have never had any problems with any of them. This unit is capable of grilling a couple of courses say meat and corn or potatoes for maybe upto three people at once. Or say maybe a dozen 1/2 lb hamburgers, yet is no larger than a couple of shoe boxes. Nice product, nice price, go for it."
4,Durable grill.,"I bought this grill to replace a Smokey Joe as a traveller. The Joe is very awkward to efficiently pack with its kettle design, and protruding legs. My expectations were that the G-A grill would be comparable to the Joe performance-wise, and provide storage efficiency. Although the G-A grill does consume less space, I don't think it offers a huge advantage over the Joe (I've also travelled with the Joe). I believe the Joe to provide cooking advantages due to it's kettle design, and different air flow, venting, structure. So I give this one four stars because I expected better performance, and more advantages over its cousin... I still really like this grill, and think it'll last forever--something I really value!Hey Weber,Bring back the wood handles!Happy grilling!"
4,Works good but...,"This little grill is well-made and it should last a long time. The vents work well and it's possible to have good control on temperature. I've used it in windy conditions with no problems. The small size Weber drip pan fits ok if you want to use one. But...I wish the ""legs"" were a little longer. I'm a little uncomfortable with how hot the table underneath the grill gets when using the grill for several hours. If it's a wet picnic table, it'll make it steam!"
4,Great Grilling!,"A little go-anywhere grill, great for camping, or even small get-togethers on the back patio. Not too small, so you can grill more than one item at a time. Folds up great to fit in the back for the on-the-go people who like good food."
5,Green Iguana; The Ultimate Owner's Manual,Great reading!!A must for all Iguana owners.The author really did his homework and it's all in there. I give it five stars!
5,Music to take you awayyyyy!!,This is just remarkable music... unforgettable!! Takes you away... and why ever come back.
5,Tal with Oscar Pettiford and Barry Galbraith,"Superb and intimate-feeling album with great playing by all involved. Barry Galbraith accompanies fantastically, gets a solo on ""Blues in the Closet,"" and Pettiford and Tal play wonderfully throughout. A lovely album from Tal's peak Verve period."
4,DeWalt HVAC guide,Good product for the price. I was looking for a way to start training my technicians for NATE certification and this DeWalt publication is getting us off to a good start. The test taking tips are very useful.
2,You know....,"Everyone says this is a classic,but it does not hold up for me. Its dated. And overated. I find others have done this kind of free-avant jazz better."
4,"Different, but good!","Have enjoyed Michelle Shocked for years. Just had the opportunity to see her in concert for the first time, and bought ""Deep Natural"" just before going to the show. It is an interesting mixture of all kinds of music, but I am still partial to her older fiddle stuff."
4,A Good Basic VCR,"As far as I can tell, this is the last of a dying breed. It does not have all the bells and whistles of previous Sony VCR's, but I consider myself lucky to have found a company that still sells the old fashioned type of VCR. It performs as advertised and has given no problems."
3,Not the Best,"I bought this VCR to replace my old Sony VCR, an SLV-AX10, which I purchased in 2000. This Full Chassis model is very fast in rewinding but a little noisy in its recording and unloading operations. In playing a tape it has recorded, it seems that at the beginning of the tape it had a problem in tracking its own recordings while there were no problems at all in playing old commercially-produced tapes. This machine was very easy to operate, similar to my old VCR and I thought it was worth the price since it was refurbished. Wrong!!! Things got worse and worse and it has been taken to the recycling center."
1,Enjoy Directv Tivo on good old black and white...,"Buyer Beware. The N750 will not record off the Directv Tivo hard drive in color. Why? Who knows. Certainly not Sony, who denies a problem exists, despite post after post from affected owners of the N750 and N700 on various websites (eg, Tivo community) that all complain of the identical issue. Even after I proved I could record in color using a borrowed 8yr old Zenith VCR and the identical cables/hook-up and tape, Sony refuses to acknowledge a compatability issue with Tivo. They did make me the generous offer of shipping me an identical, ""refurbished"" model for $45-$80 dollars (depending on warranty status)...that also won't work. If you enjoy color, and you own a Directv Tivo, buy another brand! If you want to spend quality time with Sony's head in the sand, technical support gurus, then the N750 is the unit for you."
1,FOILED (FOOLED) AGAIN,After reading all of the good reviews about this VCR I decided to buy it. It had all of the features I wanted. It worked fine for about three hours and then failed to record. I dont think any of the VCR's made today are any good. I have determined that any thing made in CHINA is JUNK.
5,Love this bowl!,"Great for pasta! Great for salad! I am very pleased with this bowl! The 20 ounce bowl is light in weight, stacks in the cabinet easily plus it is easy to clean! This bowl is a good size for watching portion sizes if on any type of diet."
5,Grill grates,These were replacement grates for my grill. These are original replacement parts. They are great.
2,A Tedious Read,"I found this book hard to read as it is so tedious, especially the first half. She belabors so many points. It might work well as a textbook, but as a book for the layperson to read, it wouldn't be my best recommendation.One gets the impression from reading the jacket that you are going to get a lot of help from this book, especially in finding your calling. She tells you what happens when you do, but no concrete answers about how to get there. Her whole idea is you have to grow. As you grow you will find better ways to cope with the workplace. I don't need her to tell me that. To me this is a cop-out after she promises so much help.There is some straightforward advice about how to handle bullies and how to negotiate a better situation for yourself at work.Ms. Jaeger may be good at personal counseling, seminars and workshops, but as far as I'm concerned, writing books is not HER CALLING."
5,Weber Makes a Real Performer,"Weber's Smokey Joe Grill is a real performer. We are so pleased we purchased one of these. We cook a lot on the grill weather permitting. The Smokey Joe Grill fires up quick. The Smokey Joe Grill also cooks up burgers, hotdogs and steaks evenly and in short order to perfection. I really mean it. We love it. The food is ready in no time. The Smokey Joe Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance. It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage. It is actually quite amazing. We have noticed that we use less charcoal, lighter fluid, save time, get better tasting food and save time on cleanup. We own two depending on how much we are going to cook. The smaller units are perfect for two people or a third or even a forth if somebody happens to stop by."
2,NO HOLES ON BOTTOM,"I just got this grill, I DO NOT Like it, it needs air holes on the bottom. It doesn't seem like the coals stay hot enough, not enough air circulating...ok as a small back up grill, but I wish I had purchased the original one with holes and plate on bottom. The locking lid is the only part i like on this Gold model apart from the other one. I DO NOT recommend buying this grill. I think I'll order the bigger 22.5 inch one next. More room for briquets."
2,more info,your desciption of the grill is great. i was wondering if it would allow me to cook a 12-14 lb turkey. maybe weber should pick up on this consideration when they sell a product.
2,No bottom vents,"Unlike the Smokey Joe silver, the gold model does not have vents on the bottom under the coals. The vents on the gold model are on the sides above the coals and are held in place by the carry handle frame. This location does not allow for proper air circulation as in other Weber charcoal grills and I had trouble getting the coals hot enough to cook even after letting them burn for a half hour. I had to transfer the food to my gas grill to cook 4 chicken breasts. Placing the cover on the grill seems to extinguish the coals. The coals were a brand new bag of Kingsford and they were dry."
4,Maintain a questioning attitude,"Perception changes whenever you change position. Likewise, perception changes as time passes. These are basic ideas to which none would disagree. In this book, Meeks shows us that the way we perceive Christ has gone through the changes also.Most of the chapters of the book were lectures given at Emory University. As such, the language of the text has an academic quality that is not always easy flowing for the lay reader. It requires a bit more focus to follow what the author is saying. Further, students of literature, history, and theology will follow more easily as they have probably heard of the scholars mentioned and will be familiar with the work.However, the gist of the book is not to ""muddy"" the proverbial waters in understanding Christ. By illustrating the change in academic perception, Meeks is showing us that Jesus is not intended to be taken for granted. We should always continue to study and discuss Jesus and what he means to us.I would recommend the book."
5,Must Have Book,From both an artistic and historical perspective this book is worth while having. The images follow the pictorialist tradition. The poses are elegant.
3,Dry Baby!,My granddaughter loved her new diapers! She loves to play with her babies and dress them and undress them!I also got her a cradle for the baby
2,Don't fit,We have the original baby alive doll which seems to be bigger than the other one & these diapers do not fit. They constantly fall off.
3,Great Diapers but expensive,We love the diapers of course...but at $1 a piece...just go buy newborn pampers or off brand. They provide the same service to a baby that won't even get a diaper rash and needs one diaper for every time you feed it
4,I love these shoes,"These are my favorite shoes. When I find something I like, I like to keep em. Unfortunately with shoes, you use em, you lose em. The leather on these last forever, easily cleaned and handle many situations well. Unfortunately for the makers of this shoe, they skimped on the sole and insole.Before I explain why I say that, let me say I wear these shoes almost every day. The insole of these shoes come loose. Happened with both pairs I have. The outsole (or bottom of the show) wears easy. I have walked a hole in one pair and the tread is almost gone on my 2nd pair. They are definately not built for heavy use.Does not matter to me because these shoes are comfortable and breathe really well. I will definately be buying another pair soon."
2,Not for Us,"I have been with my fiance for 2 1/2 yrs and we have been engaged for almost 2. This book seems to be for the older couple and it asks some questions I don't want to remember(about both of our past relationships and shaky times we had in the beginning...ie:people who tried to break us up etc. I havent been able to fill in much of this as we are ""new"" in our relationship, but I did read that in the reviews-so it's my own fault."
2,Blah.,"Too simple, I could have eventually asked all these questions myself, and wrote an answer on a peice of paper. Basically the same thing as "" doing "" the book. lame. wish i could return it."
3,Sweet,"I like the questions, but it doesnt have enough space. Each question is on one page and it doesnt give enough room for both partners to write about their experience or funny tid bit or whatever. I wish they would make one for younger starting out couples with more space and all for funny or special moment."
4,Weber grate review,These grates were purchased as a Christmas present and the recipient was pleased with them.
1,Shou Wu Pian rip off,"Of course, complete rip off. Buy for $2 each in any of SF China Town drugstores. Effectiveness also more than doubtful. As far as hair is concerned only two products MAY achieve anything at all: Propecia and Regain. I recommend the first but a prescription is needed and it's pricey. But I have kept my hair in great condition!"
1,Was not what I thought the game was.,"A waste of money that's all I have to say about this game. This game has no right to be called Romance of the Three Kingdoms, what a waste of time and money I WANT MY MONEY BACK!! Hahaha just kidding."
1,Returned - Humor outdated,A lot of the references were out of date mid-90's. It was more of a humourous book to flip through than an off the wall book to coincide with our baby.
3,Great gag gift,"This is not a book that you actually fill out, it is however a great gag gift, a must need for any baby shower gift bag."
1,This book is so bad....,"we'd return it if we still had the packing slip! There was nothing humorous or interesting about anything in this book. If we were not ""modern"" enough to appreciate this book, the parents that would find it interesting would scare the heck out of us. Don't waste your money. Want a great book to read about babies...read ""The Grandfather Thing"". Excellent."
4,It's not a book,"Don't think this is a scholarly treatise on the engineering and construction of the Bavarian dream palace. It's a hard paper cut-out, fold and glue miniature (under two feet) of the castle. Well done, if that's what you're looking for. Best for 12 years old and up model builders and as a father-son project. Would also be a swell home for some of your model soldier knights."
5,Excellent Asian Dub,"I picked this one up after a brief listen at Wild Oats listening station. It was marketed as a Yoga CD, but honestly it doesn't seem that suited to a serious Yoga session - which is a good thing. Really good yoga music shouldn't be interesting enough to distract you. And this one is quite interesting.I've tried various Asian Dub CD's before like Talvin Singh, Tabla Beat Science, etc and frankly I like this one best. More trippy sounding, no annoyingly strident vocals, lots of variety, interesting instrumentals and it doesn't kill you with repetition.This DJ is quite deft, and I'm surprised there aren't more big time releases from him. This is great stuff and I'll definitely keep my eyes open for new works by Pathaan in the future.Highly Recommended for Indian electronica but not necessarily Yoga music (at least not for me)."
1,Great idea but mine rusted,"While I have to applaud the idea, I am very disappointed with how this product stands up over time. Mine rusted within one or two months of buying them. They were outside protected by my grill so its not like they weren't protected."
5,it's not wise to cross a witch,"I only got a chance to flip through this book. But I thought it was brilliant. Some folks need to be put in thier place and words don't always do the trick. Cat callers need to learn that it's not cool to harrass us chicks on the street. Folks shouldn't borrow stuff without returning it. Not all folks follow the codes of common courtesy. I'm beginning to see hexes as a means for protecting one's self. Setting psychic boundaries, is a more PC way to phrase it. I found this book both fun and amusing, I'd recommend it for a witch who's in tune with her dark side but who's more intent on teaching someone a lesson than causing one to suffer. Whether or not you actually use these spells, I think that just reading this book would be theraputic if you feel wronged. It's written with a sense of humor...and should cheer you up."
3,You can build a better mouse trap...,"And they have. But this old design still works.It has been so long since I set one of these that I had forgotten how to do so. There was part that was nailed to the base and I had trouble figuring out why and how is it going to work if I can't use it.Bottom line is that Victor needs to print on a small piece of paper some instructions. Why force everyone to go to the Victor web site for a link to a YouTube video that is not very well made in the first place. Believe it or not, there are still people out there that can and still do live without the web.Three stars for Victor for not including instructions."
1,I wouldn't buy them if I were you,"I think that imation 2HD IBM diskettes are the WORST storage devices on the planet! A couple of other schoolmates and I were attracted by these colorful diskettes and we have come to realize that they are not durable. If you want to protect the integrity of your term papers and projects or have access to them, please do not use preformatted imation 2HD IBM diskettes, as you will be very disappointed. Moreover, you know what? Their customer support is so unprofessional ...I called them about the diskettes and they were rude. Oh! I am so upset that they position themselves as the best and actually have such terrible equipment out there...I hope that students will stop wasting their money on these diskettes.Disappointed end user"
1,Will not play on my brand new Samsung Blue Ray,"All other standard dvds work fine with the blue ray player. I believe this to be a manufacturing error. When I realized that season 2 does not play, I tried season one with the same result. Great show, but can't watch it. :("
3,Eh its ok,i ordered this for my aunt who was a huge fan of this show and she was happy to see the show again
1,Weber Rotisserie,This does not fit my Weber Genesis as the description inicated it would.I am currently waiting for a reply from Weber as to which model will fit my Weber E-310. I may have to exchange this for another.
2,Streaming Multimedia has never been more confusing,"I found this book to be much too wordy. I do not feel the need to learn the history of the internet and streaming audio and video. I just want to learn the basic concepts and how to create streaming multimedia. This book was extreme lengthy with useless info. It did, however, give me a rough overview of streaming multimedia (which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1) but now I must purchase another book to catch up. I would not recommend this book. There were maybe 6 chapters out of the 22 chapters that were slightly helpful."
4,"Good, some technical errors, but still worth the $$.","This is a good test simulator, but it has some technical errors, and some of the questions read: ""Select the best answer."" When you look at the correct answer, you find 2-3 are marked, even though it tells you to select the 'best' answer! This is very annoying. One of the better test preparation utilities. It closely mimics the real thing in the way it is presented to you, and the way it allows you to mark questions and review them. Overall, a good product, flawed, but still worth the price. Good luck on the test."
2,Very uncomfortable,These are cute shoes but very uncomfortable. I have normal width feet but the front strapes and ring detail dig into your skin.
2,child interest?,"After reading the other reviews, I couldn't wait to share this book with my 7 year old daughter, who loves books. She was confused by the story, particularly when the first-person voice changes from one character to the next. The language is very flowery, and drags a bit. She got bored and asked for another book, but we did finish it. Although I thought it was lovely, I don't think it really has child appeal."
5,What a picture book should be,"Sea Chest is a beautiful book. The writing is exquisite, and holds the reader spellbound. The art is breathtaking. The story is haunting enough to draw the reader back for another telling. Great job! A wonderful addition to any school or home library."
5,A reveiw on Ragnar's Claw.,"Although i am a Tyranid collector (Giant bugs) i found this tale of the young blood claw , Ragnar Blackmane , extremly exciting and quite easy to read.One of the extremely few negative aspects about it is that if you don't know a lot about Warhammer or Games Workshop products then you cannot understand the book.It is very good fun to see the plot unravel as they release the Demon and one of the inquisitors reveals his Chaos tendencies and is promoted to the status of Demon Prince in honor of Nurgle (The Chaos god of disease and pestilance).In conclusion i think that this book is very , very good book."
2,Bleggh,"Very poorly written, I couldn't get past page 50 or so. For example, in opening pages each paragraph uses the word ""superhuman"" to describe space marines. Action sequences are similarly redundant. Nothing comes to life in this book. Re-read the Warhammer rulebooks, they're better written and far more entertaining."
2,The Local Racoon Love's These Drip Trays,"These trays make great serving dishes for the local racoon that visits my house every evening. He LOVES those drippings, and almost ripped the whole bottom pan of the grill off to get to them."
3,PICTURE IN THE BASEMENT!!!!,"IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE SAME BRAD JOHNSON THAT PLAYED THE DEPUTY SHERIFF IN THE TV SERIES ""ANNIE OAKLEY"" WITH GAIL DAVIS.... UNBELIEVABLE!!!!"
4,Very pleased,"In addition to being a Dean and an Economics Professor, Professor Malkiel is also a finance professor and an excellent writer. I am a finance professor too, but I have never met Professor Malkiel. This book summarizes the most important findings of investment researchers in an easy-to-read manner. I dont see any negative aspects to this book."
1,This is not Klein's best work,"Unfair and Unbalanced is Robert Klein's 2010 HBO stand-up special. Klein is no HBO rookie - he actually filmed the first HBO special 35 years ago. The film left me wanting more. Klein opens with a song compelling President Obama to not follow in former President Clinton's footsteps and to ""keep it in his pants."" This is weird. Its like the joke is lost on me because there hasn't been any Lewinsky-esque rumors about the current President. The stand-up offers a few giggles and then more musical interludes. An ode to medical marijuana falls flat also. I'm sure Klein has some good work out there, so I recommend seeing that. Only a die-hard can appreciate this one."
5,good for a girl too!,"I got this for my daughter because it is neautral colors and because I didn't want her room to look like a pink paintball exploded, so this is very adorable and cozy!"
4,Disservice to Dennis,"Five Stars for Dennis whose singing is exemplary with beauty and understanding and excellent Italian and French. HOWEVER, 2 stars for Roger Vignoles, piano accompanist, for prosaic, dull, bored accompianments that sound like he was sight reading. Two stars for the pamphlet which, while it carries the full texts in the language of the song, just summarize the English translations, even skipping many of the lines! Two stars for the tempos which speed along when Tosti's songs mostly are very reflective and poignent and require attention to detail and to emotion. Finally 3 stars to the choice of selections, 3/4 of which are choice Tosti with 1/4 being less than his best. All in all a great disservice to Dennis' lovely voice and a lost opportunity to hear Tosti's songs being given proper and tender renditions."
1,"Don't ever buy K-Tel stuff, it's never the original artists!","I am not writing this because I work or represent a competitor of K-Tel, I'm just writing this because I've spent too much money on their albums that were advertised as being the original tracks from the original artists and found out later I wasted my money. NONE of the albums I've found on Amazon.com with the K-Tel logo on them have the original artists performances of the songs. None. They must be making a lot of money ripping people off."
1,Watered Down,"I received a sample of this for Christmas and when it ran out I ordered it from Amazon. I got many compliments while using the sample. The bottle I got from Amazon is nowhere as fragrant as the sample bottle. Not even close. I use twice as much and can barely smell it. No comments since using this product. I am not a fragrance expert, this is only my opinion, based on my experience."
5,Awesome!,"I cannot think of an easier way to start a fire, be it charcoal on the Performer grill instead of using expensive propane bottles, or a wood fire in the fireplace. These things light instantly and burn forever."
2,item arrived broken,The collar is made of plastic and the item arrived broken in two places where the arms attach to the collar. I am returning the item and will not reorder the same one. I question the durability.
1,Lehigh Large Capacity Outdoor Aluminum Clothes Dryer,"Though very happy with the product at first - the plastic 'joints' or brakets broke on the fourth use - do not know why since I was setting the dryer up and there was no undue pressure, just going about things normally. By the way Home Depot is selling these for $30."
4,Nice dryer,"This is a really nice dryer. It is easy to install and adjust, and does what it needs to do. I am absolutely hooked on drying clothes outside -- I can get about 4 loads done in a morning -- it is much more convenient and quicker than using the clothes dryer.Do heed the weight restrictions, though. I overloaded mine with some heavy blankets. That was kind of a bummer -- but not the clothesline's fault!"
2,not so great,this one a one season item for me... once i had the thing up i couldnt get it to unlatch to come down ... neither can my husband so it cant stand up to any weather without the hardware becoming unusable ..
1,Very weak; ours broke.,"Base of the pole snapped, sending the pole full of clothes tumbling over. Very weak material. Do not recommend."
1,Forget it!,"I have had the same experience as others: the plastic hinges break almost immediately, rendering the product useless. One of these hinges was already cracked when I unpacked the item, but I elected to plunge ahead anyway; five more were broken within a month. Look elsewhere!"
5,Great humane trap,It took a while to find the right location but once I did the trap has been catching mice daily.I got tired of pulling little bodies out of my cupboards and with a toddler in the house I was always worried she would get hurt by one of the conventional snap traps if I put in a more open location. I baited it with dry dog food and presto we have mice!It's a little more pricy than the snap traps but in the long term it will be cheaper and this is the same type trap the experts use.
2,Didn't work.,"Last year I bought the trap and used as bait the exact same food s/he had been nibbling in the pantry. I put the food towards the far end of the trap, so it would be harder to sneak in and out. I figured out how to set the thing, and secured it closed with a rubber band because the door seemed to open pretty easily.I set it down in the corner of the pantry shelves and waited. A few days went by. A week went by. Moved it to a different position. Tried different baits. More weeks went by. No mouse. The trap had been seemingly untouched. I'm glad you other people had luck with this, because I didn't.(I give it two stars because I appreciate that it has plenty of ventilation.)"
2,"Always in, too often out!",It's no problem enticing mice into the Tin Cat with almost any kind of bait. The problem is they manage to escape through the entrance openings over 50% on the time. Obviously mice are more clever than the technology on the device.
5,This is a better mousetrap,"Many years ago Victor only made the spring loaded traps everyone used. I remember as a kid someone stepping on one and screaming in pain when it snapped on their bare foot.The old style traps are much more cost effective than the Victor Tin Cat but not more effective in any other way. The Tin Cat works great, does not present a hazard to people or pets and does not yield a messy dead crushed rodent.The traps need to be checked every day if you want to release the captured mice alive, otherwise they die from stress or dehydration."
1,Fighting scenes too slow. Same Storyline as other movies.,I bought this movie because Donnie Yen is listed as one of the actors. What a disappointment it is. The fighting scenes are so slow that it looks like the fighterS are rehearsing not fighting.The color is faded. The storyline is the same old as others.It is a waste of time and money. I will never buy any action movies produced before 1990 any more.
3,Nice,"This book was of course very nice, but not excellent. The photographic printing seemed a bit dated and it somehow didn't give a real impression of what the villas were really like...a little impersonal. Only Frank Lloyd Wright's house at the end seemed to have enough photos that you got a real feel for it. That said, it is a nice book and I'm sure very interesting for some."
3,Nothing to write home about...,"Rocking Horse Winner's sophomore record is stuffed with all-too-familiar melodic pop, yet unfortunately, the kind that is instantly forgettable. Jolie Lindholm does have a fairly impressive voice, though it always seems to lack any kind of soulfullness, which doesn't fail the songs any since they don't seem to carry a lot of emotional content anyway. In the end, it feels as though you're watching a commercial for teenage complexion cream. Rocking Horse Winner is fine for first dates, or while eating bowls of sugary cereal, or penning lamentful poems about the girl in the front row who moved away, but don't expect to be blown away by a record full of emotion, artistry, and caliber that so many other bands deliver with room to spare. This record is alright to own, just don't pay full price for it."
2,Not so good after a couple of years of use,"I've had this hole punch for a couple years now and have recently replaced it. There is no way this punch will punch through twelve sheets of paper! To prove my point, I just tried it, again, and it did not work. As usual the metal bracket that holds the push lever in place bent away from the body of the hole punch and the punch did not work. I've had to bend it back so many times, I'm certain it's only going to take a few more before the metal bracket breaks. The action is fairly smooth but this punch does take up a lot of storage space. Again, I know you cannot actually punch twelve sheets of 20 pound paper - at least not with the one I have. One nice feature is the sliding bottom tray. You don't have to remove the whole bottom to empty it."
4,Looks great...doesn't stick,"This border looks really good...we painted the top half blue and the bottom green. I read the other reviews stating it didn't stick well but wanted it anyway. Needless to say, it doesn't stick good...we had to go buy paste to get it to stay. But I love the way it looks and am glad that I got it."
1,It's not easy being green,"Yep. I just bought this thing last night & will be returning it today because:A. The headsets that came with it are so cheap, one broke within the first 5 minutes of me trying to get it on my ear.B. The video is always green. Not a nice subtle green either. At first I thought it was night vision or something because it was at night, but today it's still showing a dark green preview. I've fiddled with the options & it's not helping. (I'm a webmaster, so it's not like I'm a computer-tard or anything).Seriously, if they were selling these things for $5 a pop I'd still turn it down. Save yourself some time & money because you WILL want to return it."
3,Misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set,"This trap is effective. It misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set. The Victor 0631 works well if you are willing to take 5-10 minutes to clearance the blade slots in the soil yourself and then set the trap ""just right"". It may go off on you the first few times after you set it in the ground, so be prepared to set it multiple times. It has a safety catch so it won't alarm you too much if it goes off when you place it in the ground.The Wire Tek 1001 is double the money but is set by simple foot operation which expands the blades, thus self-clearancing the soil blade slots. The Victor 0631 is made in China which does not please me. The Wire Tek 1001 is made in the USA and is more rugged. Its clamping force is double as it has two springs which allows it to close very quickly and with authority. Grass and roots will not interfere with the Wire Tek's effectiveness."
1,Dissatisfied,"The trap is difficult to set. It requires a lot of physical exertion, and it is very awkward to set. The trigger mechanism goes from hard to spring to a hair trigger. Thumbs down on this one!"
1,Total lack of response from Northern Tool & Equipment,"After placing an order for items noted as in stock, not receiving any notification from the supplier of the order:- The estimated ship by date passed without any action- First Email to supplier went without acknowledgement- Second Email to supplier went without acknowledgement- Final date to expect the order passed- Email sent to cancel order with all info provided and no acknowledgement- Still awaiting the confirmation of the cancellation as of this writing.This could be isolated but was enough to prevent me from ever doing business with Northern Tool & Equipment in the futre.Ended up going with BIC Superstore and placed the order on a Monday and received the order on Thursday of the same week!!!! Life is good again unless I get caught in limbo with the apparent open order that caused all of this grief....."
1,not useful in CA,"I tried using this product for about a year with no success. I'm sure this works great in loamy lawns but I have plants, not grass, and live in suburban California, which means lots of clay! It is extremely difficult to find mole runs except in winter when the rain softens the clay. For my particular situation, i've found the Cinch mole traps to be extremely effective - they worked in a week. I did modify my method to try to match what other reviewers and youtube videos show, but if you don't have a nice soft lawn, there are better tools to catch moles with."
2,Can't get it set...,"I bought two of the traps last month. I tried to get them set and in the ground. I spent about an hour trying to get the trap set, but it would not stick. I haven't taken the time to try and get them to work since then b/c the Grubex I put down seems to have slowed down the mole activity in my yard.I'll definately try to get them set again if the mole activity picks back up, but right now they are just collecting dust in my shed."
1,defective device,"no instructions provided. Trap would not open. when trying to set the trap, cut my finger. It appears that the device was not bent. not sure since no instructions"
1,The Moles will be safe with this piece of junk,Don't waste your time buying this piece of junk. The instructions must have been done by a three year old and trap cannot be set as shown. Customer service people do not even repond to my inquiries.
3,Mole Trap,The trap itself seems to be great. The instructions are not very clear but you can find videos on youtube for help.
3,It is hard to set,"I found it very hard to set and to keep set. The springs are quite strong an hard to hold with one hand and the trigger doesn't stay shut very well. I have allways used the loop type traps such as the Nash ""Choker Loop"" mole trap that were easier and safer to use. However, these are very well made and cost alot less than the loop types."
2,Victor Mole trap,I can open the trap (it takes strength) but I can not set the safety.The safety seems to be short.Therefore I have not been able to use it.I was disapointed.
4,Oh my,"solid, well made product.works and works well if placed well.the only beef i have is that it is difficult for me to set.Read my full review on my blog [...]"
4,The Mole is DEAD!!!,"Title pretty much tells it all. Read the review by Geoffrey Klos and follow his instructions exactly...I set up the trap exactly as he said and less than 24 hours later, the mole was dead!!! Thanks Mr. Klos, your great review has saved my lawn.15 Aug update: Second mole is dead and I haven't seen another one since. I did have one of the arms on the trap break--not sure how it happened since I noticed it when the trap was not in use. Amazon replaced within days."
1,Impossible to assemble,"I don't know who could assemble this mole trap but it would take a strong hand and a persistent helper.If we could put it together and we did catch a mole, I guess it would mean going through the process all over again.We sent it back."
4,"For older preschoolers, school-aged kids","I liked the idea of this book, but there aren't many pictures of horses in the book. I got this for our 2 year old son because there aren't many horse books out there, especially for boys as well as girls. He liked it, but is still too young to trace the patterns or I guess understand the abstract idea that the horse made the pattern. If you're looking for a really good horse book for boys or girls all about horses, I suggest the Sesame Subjects book. Although that's also for an older age level, our 2 year old loves it."
3,Not What It Seems,"The wording on the front ""A Children's Book of Horses"" misleads the buyer because it seems like it is about the different types of horses when, in fact, the book is about Happy Horse and only makes mention of Happy Horses' friends, such as Runny Horse. Another disappointing aspect about the book is that it somewhat takes the reader through a horses' typical day, but gets lost in the middle with trying to teach shapes. It seems that the shapes idea was tossed in there like a bad ingredient in a great casserole. However, for 2-3 year olds the book is okay."
3,Wrong product,This product was not what I expected. The size of the product was not what I thought it would be. I think it was my mistake.
2,No wonder this album was not released in America!!!,"I was curious to find out why this album was not realized in America after WhiteSnake had such a smash with their previous album. Now I know! This album is flat out terrible. Being a huge David Coverdale fan, it pains me to say that, but it's true. It has none of the bluesy sound from the early Whitesnake albums or the pizazz of their 1987 album. Half hearted perfomances at best. Anyone who gave this album a good review must love David Coverdale so much that they can't be objective any more. Sorry David, it's terrible, and you know it! THAT's why it wasn't released in America! The record company must have known after one listen that it would not go over well here. In comparison, David's latest album, Into the Light, is far better."
4,Motor w/ Power Assembly works great,"After calling dealerships pricing how much it would be to replace my driver side window regulator, I decided to see how much the parts would be. This was a much cheaper option. The dealerships would have charged a minimum of $450 while I was able to get it fixed for approximately $175 purchasing the parts myself and having it installed at an auto shop. The regulator works great and if I do have to purchase another for any other window, I will go the same route."
4,Better than the ones that come on your hose,"Higher quality rubber washer. They are of better quality than the ones that come on your garden hose. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't give a ""perfect"" seal all the time and there's sometimes a drip. This could possibly be the lower quality of my hose too. Good product."
5,The Moyer Site,"This is the report of the excevation of an early 15th century village near New Dundee, Ontario from 1970-72. Ten long houses were discovered, as well as three middens, from which numerous artifacts were recovered. The analysis of the artifacts of the Moyer Site was one of the first instances where computers were utilized. Even though this report is intended for academics, it still provides those with a general interest in the subject a better understanding of pre-Contact life in southern Ontario."
4,Book synopsis...,"Charles Edgar Framington, alias, Frag, is up to his neck in trouble. A drug dealer and assassin, he lets his bosses down once too often and has to go on the run.Special Agent Tom Devaney has made it his life work to track down Frag and make the charges against him stick. The only clues he has are a trail of bodies with Frag's signature single, lethal stab wound.Kelly Mason, rebellious teen, moves in with her self-centered Dad thinking her new freedom will give her the best time of her life. But her drinking and running away from home puts her on a collision course with the fugitive Frag.Only her mother, the feisty and determined Jennifer Daily, stands between Kelly and disaster, as Frag's final series of crimes before fleeing the country drags her daughter into a bightmare of mayhem and murder."
3,takespatience,This games is very cute and my granddaughter enjoyed picking out the dress and jewelry but the directions on how to get through each world aren't always easy to understand.
5,"Short, Easy, Fun","This game only took about 5 times playing to complete the whole game. Because it was bought for my 4 year-old she loved it. She made me play most of the time, but my boys even watched. Cute game."
4,Good for young princesses!,"We bought this hoping that our 3 and a half year old would be able to play it. She has done pretty well and can play as long as one of us is with her. The remote aspect is easy for all the need to do is wave the wand around the numchuck sometimes gets her stuck. It is not a long or that challenging of a game, but perfect for children who don't have a lot of experience with the wii. She asks to play the game and we usually play in half hour segments. She loves all the disney characters and really enjoys the game. I figure for [...], it wasn't that bad of a cost, the graphics were decent. One aspect I liked about the game was that each section (other than Belle's) game with three chapters each, so she could complete a chapter and then go back later to finish each section."
5,Addictively fun.,"I bought this so my daughters would have fun playing it in the future. I got addicted the game and played it all the way through in no time. when my oldest daughter is just a lil older, it will be fun to get to play along side her. The bonus level you have to work towards is a jip though. otherwise have fun."
3,Disney Princess,Another game that was fun but over quickly. It would benice to have some more levels of play or things to dothat wouldn't be completed so soon.
4,Good enough for 4 year old,"we just got a Wii and I wanted to find a game that my 4 year old would be interested in. I like this game because you can play as a team (2 at the same time). She has learned to use the nunchuk very well. I play along with her to help get what she needs and assist on tasks that she has trouble with. I like that we can play together. The graphics are decent, the story is nice, and she loves to customize her princess each time we play.I can see that an older child would probably get through the game rather quickly, so I am glad that she is playing it now. I don't really have many complaints."
2,Not worth the money,"We bought this game so our five year old daughter would have her own game for the Wii. Boy, do I wish we'd gone with the Barbie one instead. The graphics on this are horrible. She did finally figure out how to play it some by herself, but it is tricky, even the big people couldn't figure out the right moves for some of it. It was really disappointing."
4,Good even for a three year old,"I bought this game for my three year old and was afraid that it would be too complicated for her. I was pleasantly surprised that she picked up on the controls as well as she did, although I certainly have to sit next to her to help her out with the aiming of the Wii remote, etc.She LOVED it - the first time we turned it on we played for an hour and I had to drag her away from it. The 'easy' princess rooms are good for my three year old but the ones labeled as 'hard' were definitely tough (even for me - but granted, I'm not a video game expert at all.) She particularly loves being able to dress her princess girl and change her hair, clothes, and accessories. I think she'll grow into this nicely and we'll play it for years."
5,Great Game,"This game is great! My 6 year old and 3 year old absolutely love it. It is great that it is not too hard for my 6 year old and my 3 year old runs around pretending she is the characters, doing what they are doing on screen. :)"
3,Too Much Story...Difficult for my 5 year old,"My 5 year old daughter does enjoy playing this game, but with the Wii remote and the numchuck needed, it becomes a bit difficult to manuever both at the same time. So we had to play this together where Id hold the numchuck and she just waved the magic wand. Well when Im running to get from place to place and all she does is jump and spin, it gets a little nauseating to watch. :-)Overall the game does keep her attention, but there is too much story involved where it does lose her interest a bit. However she asks to play it all the time! I am hoping there is another princess game or game geared towards a little girl out there that is right on the mark. Anyone have any suggestions?"
3,"Good game for young girls, overpriced for what you get","The game is a lot of fun for our four year old daughter.Pros:-The graphics are pretty good-The voices are good-Young girls will like the interaction the games providesCons:-The game has problems with the Wii remote reading the infrared on the parts when you have to point at the screen-The worlds of the game are very small, Disney should have given us a lot more for $40"
3,Nice game,"My daughters enjoy this and seem to be able to play it by themselves. It is cute, but I don't know how long they will play it."
1,Is it a joke?,I can't believe that the Met produced a ridiculous circus like version of the Magic Flute. Sung in English? The Met totally ruined one of the most beautiful operas. Don't waste your money!
1,Utter disappointment!,"Utter disappointment! Second class singers (by own MET standards, with the exception of Pape as Zarastro), noisy and visually distracting production (although it has its moments of magic, impossible to avoid with any Magic Flute anyway...), public clapping after every single number (looks like we are in a circus presentation), and worse of all: a mutilated, harmonic disgruntled overture. OK, I agree that is interesting to produce an easy-to-listen-to opera to captivate new audiences, but why Mr. Levine has agreed to cut so drastically the overture is beyond my comphehension. One additional issue: for those who know this beloved opera by heart, listening to Tamino, Pamina and company speaking English seems quite disconcerting. In summ: if we had the complete (with due repetitions) overture I would give a second star. As it is, one star is still too much for the disappointment that this version brings to our ears, eyes and hearts."
4,Fun to watch and surprised it sang in English,"Well, well, what a fun to watch. Beautiful and very effective stages sets. I am a little surprised it sang in English. But somehow it works.Papageno is the highlight of this product, which you can tell by the applauses from the audiences. The Queen is also technically brilliant on those high notes. Pamela was doing ok, though I have seeing better.Somehow, I wish to hear the orchestra in Baroque style as it was original written. But I guess just not with Met orchestra though.Overall it is a fun opera to watch. Not as fun as the one I played with Opera Ozark though.I think this opera is perfect to re-version to a smaller production just for the kids. They probably would like it and also educational (ex. like if you lies about things, you get lock on your mouth ;)Another thing I noticed is they had very 'generous' cut on the overture. Which, I prefer they'd played it all."
2,Poorly constructed,"The latching mechanism is cheaply constructed. When the trap is set, it only takes a small vibration to trigger the dropping of the door. I have used traps before that have a spring loaded door that easily opens and closes. With the Havahart 1079, you have to slide a small clip into a notch and hope it stays. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
5,it works pretty good for catching groundhogs,"We have a couple of pear trees and an apple tree in our backyard. Beginning of this summer groundhogs started to make our backyard their home and getting closer to our house. They ate plants, dug holes, and pooing around. I found people shoot them with rifles on internet and the other option is to trap them. I chose the second option and bought this cage. So far, this cage caught 10 groundhogs 1 raccoon. It didn't miss a setup. To set up this cage, the following web page helps me a lot.[...]"
1,Trap does not work,"The trap does not work. The raccoon steps right over the trigger mechanism, grabs the food, then leaves the trap. I have watched him do this two nights in a row now. Buy a different trap."
5,It works!,"I am very impressed with the Havahart 1097 animal trap. I have a problem with feral cats in my neighborhood, and have tried less expensive traps without a lot of success...they were difficult to set up (hard on the fingers), and often the bait would be gone and the trap left either set or sprung without any sign of the critters. The havahart trap is a sturdy, good quality trap that is easy to set up. I tried the trap for the first time last night, and caught a feral tom. He's off with animal control now, and I'll be setting the trap again tonight. It works. Enough said."
4,Success - time and again,"I've used this trap to catch groundhogs (woodchucks) and done so successfully on a number of occasions.The trap is easy to set up. We covered it with a little hay both inside and on top to make it seem more natural. We use fresh ice burg lettuce as bait, which they absolutely love and we put the trap near their hole. It took about 3 days to catch the first one, then 2 days for the second and third.Releasing can be tricky - the trap is easy enough to open, but you want to make sure you're safe and that the animal won't be tempted to come after you. I usually release from inside the van, opening the side door and putting the cage on the ground.Be sure to clean the cage after every use, and keep it clean and dry in between uses."
4,Works as advertised.,Caught a racoon that was hanging around my business' dumpster within a few minutes of setting the trap. My only complaint is that I wish there was some kind of a screen you could lift to protect your hands when you're opening the door to release the trapped animal. I ended up making a grid of twigs to keep the racoon from clawing at my fingers.
5,A great value,First class construction. Durable.Very functional. Easy to bait and set.Three raccoons were captured and relocated within the first week.
2,Not heavy duty at all,"Was trying to punch a hole in 5ml lamination, the punch collapsed out of shape on the first one. May work better on paper, but is very flimsy construction in my view."
3,This is really bothering me-was it edited?,"I read this twenty-five years ago and I just picked up a new copy an re-read it again. I feel like I have an edited version of the original book. Has this book been rewritten into a ""PG version""? I don't see anyone talking about that, but this book isn't like I remembered it unless I'm confusing it with another book. My version seems to have glossed over the abuse scenes when I remember them being extraordinarily powerful.Anyone?"
4,Interesting book - good read!,"This book was recommended to me and I would definitely recommend it as well! Very interesting story. It's tough to comprehend the trauma that caused Sybil's multiple personalities, but it helps to paint a picture of how this could happen. I still have to finish the book, but plan to read others that go into the back ground of this one."
4,Understanding of Multiple personalities,Sybil is an infomative book about the turmoils of a person dealing with multiple personalities. To acually realize that such a thing can occur is breath taking. And to acually be able to understand the mind process of thing that are happening in the persons life is a wonderful thing to learn about
1,I hope this is listed as fiction,Rather stunned to find out after all these years that this book is not true but made-up between the three people involved.New Salon article sums up a lot which has been disclosed over the recent years. The story of Sybil's split personality is fake. [...]How very sad.
1,This story has been proven totally false,"Do a search on the true story. Find out what really happened and how her ""therapist"" actually created and named the personalities. Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books."
5,Paperclips!! what will they think of next?!!,These paper clips provided a well needed expression to the office. They are the highlight of my day. when ever i need to hold papers together or ........ these are very excellent paper clips for 33 cents
2,What was this about?,This book seemed to be about nothing. I was expecting something to happen within the novel but nothing big really did. I think this was just written so they could call it a trilogy. I am hoping that the next book will be a lot better. I have read all of the Shatner's Trek novels and this is the only one I wouldn't give five stars. This book took me forever to read because I didn't find it gripping at all. Does anyone know what this book was about? If so put it in your review and enlighten me. THANKS!!!!
1,waste of money -- just didn't work at all.,"Repeating: it was just a waste of money. It didn't work at all...and yes, it was set up according to the directions. We have yet to trap the first mole....and there are mole tracks all over our yard."
2,The last 100 pages are great.,"This book had the potential to be an American ""Hornblower"" but instead is a series of vignettes about the early Civil war. The main character, Lt. Bowater, barely appears in half the book. The story finally gets going in the last 100 pages, if you can stick to it that long."
5,the start of something big,"Here is where the legendary X-Men franchise began -- with a single title featuring five teenagers and a crippled mentor. Their first fight as a team is against one of the great supervillains, Magneto. Subsequent issues feature such bizarre and unique menaces as the Vanisher, the Blob and Unus the Untouchable. Magneto returns with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to even things up. Then the Avengers visit for a clash of the titans!If that weren't enough, all of the above are products of that team supreme, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. (You know, the ones responsible for the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, etc.)Before this book, there were no mutants in the Marvel Universe. But, issue by issue, this title laid the seeds of an entire mutant population! (At least until House of M decimated them.)"
5,first ten issues of the uncanny x-men .,"The marvel masterworks of the uncanny x-men tells how the x-men started out. This book shows the first appearence of Magneto , the coming of Jean Gray, and Magneto's brotherhood of evil mutants. This collection of comics was well worth the price. I give it two thumbs up."
3,Gold - Lionel Richie,"This was a gift. Therefore, I'm not making any judgements on the album. The one who received it seems to like it."
4,The Privateer--Swashbuckling action & adventure for today,"Good YA reading. The author doesn't skirt the truth about pirates and privateers, but doesn't write in such a way as to turn off the squeamish. Action abounds as the crew faces one encounter after another. Enough action for modern movie goers. In fact, Captain Maxwell's efforts to become a queen's privateer would make a good movie, though I suppose movie makers would feel compelled to write more into the relationship with the rescued lady."
2,Confusing Book for the Utterly Confused,"I am just a beginner in learning French, but basic spelling and pronunciation mistakes I encounter from page 6 of the book and almost on every second page (both in the English and French variants) make me put the book aside, since it confuses me even more!I don't know who is to blame: the author or the publisher, but somebody is responsible for the unprofessional edition."
1,COPY PROTECTED! BUYER BEWARE!,"This album is amazing... i made the mistake of buying it, now i'm stuck with a great album i can't listen to anywhere because i can't download it on my ipod and now my computer is infested with that copy protection software. I buy CD's like crazy and have never downloaded music ilegally, yet, I won't make the same mistake again, I won't purchase Copy Protected CD's no matter how good they might be.BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Excellent,My daughter loves this swing. You can also buy Graco toys to add to the tray. The different speeds and songs are wonderful. It is also not too bad on batteries.
1,Poorly designed,"Its an okay swing, but several times now, the mobile has fallen off and hit the baby while he was sleeping. Now he won't sleep in it anymore. Also drains batteries quickly and the seat is too narrow for our 4 month old. He weighs 15 pounds and is almost too big for it already"
5,I use it every day,When I bought this I figured it was another gadget. I really love it. It's easy to use and really easy to clean. I did have a problem with the poaching tray. It starting peeling. I e-mailed back to basics and they are sending me another one. They said they have redesigned it. It's become a staple in my kitchen.
5,Convenient and delicious!,"I love this item and I'm not even that big on breakfast sandwiches. It is so easy and quick and I don't have a bunch of dishes to wash. Just be careful if you lift the top off to add cheese to pork roll or sausage. I burned my thumb pretty good, a blonde moment. Well worth the money. Think I will get one for my college son, even he can handle this."
1,Toaster failed after a few weeks,I loved this product but the toaster failed after a few weeks. The customer support number is out of service and sending it back may just be a waist of time and money.
1,incorrect power rating,"i just received this as a present, i live in new zealand. the toaster only has US power rating. this should have been checked before shipping. as i cannot plug it in, i cannot review this product"
4,nice but slow,"This toaster/cooker works very well. My only complaint is how slow the toaster is. The heat elements have a baffle between them and the item you are toasting. This is so your toast,muffin,pop tart etc. doesn't get done way before your eggs and/or sausages do. There is no way to speed up the toasting process when that's the only function you're using."
1,Broke after a year,"I had this toaster for 1 year and one day it just stopped working completely. And even when it was working, it toasted unevenly on the 2 sides of the bread.Before this, I had a truely bottom-of-the-line toaster that lasted for 8 years and still wasn't dead. I expect an appliance to last at least a little longer than one year. Toasters are one of the most basic appliances out there."
5,We Bought Three,"We bought our first unit about eight months ago and have been very happy with it. It makes fixing breakfast a snap for two people. Our daughter wanted one, so we bought one for her birthday. We recently bought the third one for our summer house. We would highly recommend this product."
1,Do Not Buy !,"I bought this toaster, use it for 2 month then everything died ! egg poacher would not heat up toaster would not toast and it wouldn't turn on !"
1,Worked well first time!!!,"The first time I made egg sandwiches it was awesome - a low fat (no grease) breakfast sandwich. The first time I made 4 hard boiled eggs it was awesome - they looked pretty and were soooo easy to peel. I thought I had FINALLY found a way to make hard boiled eggs. In the past, no matter what method I used, the eggs were always hard to peel & sometimes had green areas in the yolk. The next few times I made hard boiled eggs they cracked, boiled over outside the shell through the puncture hole, made a mess in the cooking tray and were full of water (yuck) when I peeled them. I'm NOT pleased with these results. I read a lot of the reviews prior to purchasing and thought I was making a wise decision."
2,"Good toaster, bad egg cooker","The toaster works fine, but the egg cooker went belly up within 3 months of purchase. Now the egg cooking/steaming mechanism does not work at all, not even slightly heating the water. Maybe I got a lemon, I'm going to try returning it for a replacement.Edit to add: I found the warranty phone number for Back to Basics online (I've long since thrown out the box and packaging) and called them. They asked for some information from the bottom, for some personal contact info, and what my purchase date was (but did NOT ask for official verification of that!) and are sending a new toaster to arrive in 5 to 7 days! WOW! Now I'm just totally bowled over by the customer service! Yippeee, a week away from home made egg mcmuffins again!"
4,Toast adn egge poacher,This is the fourth one I bought. Last year for Christmas I bought my two children and myself this product. My only regret I had to purchase another because one got worn out. I cook breaskfasts on weekends and use daily for toast for breakfast and hard boiled eggs for lunch.Still amazed how the toast knows the eggs are cook to finish at the same time.
4,Fun and Fast Breakfast,"My husband laughed at me when we I got this but we have loved it. It is very easy and makes a great breakfast in no time. Without having to watch anything, just pop in the ingredients and by the time you walk out the door for work...hot breakfast! We also hard boil eggs for salads in it. Plus, the parts are small and fit in the dishwasher so no washing pans. It does take up extra space on the countertop and you can only cook the ingredients for one egg/muffin sandwich at a time but we love ours."
2,died suddenly and quickly,"I finally found this old review of mine and decided to edit it based on the fact that this appliance died suddenly after several months of light use. Its quality sucked. Not worth the money. I hope my previous 4-star review had not been misleading.Pros:Very convenient for a quick morning breakfast.Healthy, too, with no need to fry eggs.Cons:The first time using the egg poacher, the machine gives a plastic smell, coz everything except the steamer is made of plastic. Not sure on how long these plastic things can last at boiling temperature several minutes a day.Cannot comment on how long it can last, though, coz I just had it for one week. Like it a lot and would like to recommend it to everyone."
2,Almost Killed Me,"My boyfriend and I have had this product for at least 6 months now. It worked alright for the first few months, and then the egg cooker just stopped working one day. We've been using the toaster portion of the appliance with no problems.Just the other morning, I awoke to a horrible screeching sound that was coming from the kitchen. My boyfriend investigated and found that the heating element within the egg cooker had started working and turned itself on again. It was smoking, and probably would have burnt my apartment down had I not heard the horrible noise it was making.I like egg sandwiches, but I also like my apartment not burning to the ground."
2,A good product - until it dies.,"When we got this toaster, all was great. The only complaint I had was that water would pool on the egg from the steam, and I would have to dab it with a paper towel so it wouldn't be sopping wet. Also at first there was a burnt plastic smell, but that went away after a few uses.We've only had it 5 months, though, and now the egg cooking component does not work at all. Nothing happened, it just stopped working. Apparently this is common, reading back reviews from 2005 on (at other websites). You'd think they would have this fixed by now.I am never buying this brand again - Back to Basics has given me nothing but grief. (Their smoothie maker starts leaking all over after a few uses!)"
4,Excellent Toaster - Large eggs could be a problem,"This is an excellent toaster. Very easy to use and clean. The only drawback I had with this item is that, you cannot use this with large eggs to make hard boiled eggs. Other than that this serves its purpose"
2,The Jury is Still Out,"I've used this three times and noticed that the protective coating on the egg tray is flaking off. I have to wonder what chemicals may be seeping into my egg without the protective coating. I will probably return it, as we all receive enough carcinogens in everything else..."
1,TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,"PRO:1. Cooked the egg perfectlyCONS:1. Cooked 1 egg perfectly... the steaming section now doesn't work... after the FIRST USE...2. Toast finishes too soon.- Im going to contact customer support today... i received the toaster yesterday, and already have to request an exchange... it appears it's 50/50 if you get one that will last or is a P.O.S. out of the box...Side note - reading the reviews commenting on its shoddy craftsmanship i made SURE to follow all directions prior to use, and during use... every last sentence was read and step taken... still broke after one use..."
1,"Seriously, they really do break","I ignored the reviews saying this was defective because i was so in love with the idea. Mine worked perfect ... for about three months, then died. During that time, I bought one for a friend and it was non-functional right out of the box. When you open the box, btw, there's a notice that begs you to contact the manufacture instead of the vendor if/when the device breaks -- presumably so that places like Amazon don't stop carrying the product. Judging from the reviews, this thing has been sold defective for years. Please don't continue to reward this company with new purchases."
1,Awful acquisition,We got this thing last week.It came broke from the store and doesn't work when plugged on the wall.We are returning it.
2,About 5 wonderful uses before it broke,"For $29.99 at the time, I was very happy with the toaster. I used an demo'ed it a couple times, with toast, poached eggs, hardboiled eggs, and bfast sausage. All came out great and even.However, tried to turn it on this morning and, like many other reviews noted, the egg portion wouldn't heat up any more.I read some horror stories about replacement issues, but I must say the customer service (the number is in the book) was wonderful. I spoke with Maggie and she had me setup with a replacement in under 3 minutes flat.I'll come back and update this review after I get some use out of the replacement hopefully."
2,"Good Toaster, Horrible Poacher",Toaster still works great but doesn't poach anymore. Tried everything still nada. I say either bet on a more expensive one or better yet get toaster and poacher seperately
1,"Bought 3, none lasted more than 50 uses","This is a great device that doesn't last very long. I loved using Morningstar Sausage/Egg muffin in the morning. However, I owned this product 3 times, and each time the device broke after about 40 uses (4-5 months). After the first breakage, Target exchanged it. By the second breakage Target had stopped carrying them. I bought my third from Amazon and now that one broke. I'm still within the 1 year warranty, but the time wasted returning these is not worth the time savings in the kitchen. What a bummer. I hope a more reliable company will make these soon."
4,Great toaster/Just Good egg poacher,"I love this gadget also. I've owned it for over two years, and I love making my own breakfast sandwiches at home. So convenient. I only wish the egg poacher portion were built as well as the toaster. The handle on the poaching tray broke off in the first year, and now the other plastic pieces are cracking. This changes my five star rating to a four star, but I'm still considering buying the four slice, two egg model!"
1,Just stopped working one day,"I enjoyed the toaster when it worked, but the other day it just stopped working??"
4,Start your day right with protein,"My fiance and I bought ours maybe 6 months ago and we love it. He does the whole egg-sausage-muffin-cheese thing a few times a week. He's an early morning commuter, so he sets it to cook while he takes a quick shower and then wraps it in some wax paper to take with him on the drive. Mind you, if you multi-task while its cooking, you better like your egg well-done because it does keep cooking in the steam after the toaster turns off.Myself, I do everything but the sausage. I think it makes a fairly healthy breakfast if you eat some fruit on the side. I like my yolk soft and gooey, so I'm there as soon as it's done. It's always hot enough to melt the cheese I put on top, too.Somebody commented that you can't do two eggs in a row, but I've done it many times right after my fiance.It's not the best toaster, but if you keep the setting between Low and Med-low it comes out alright."
5,Quick Breakfast for all!,"Love our toaster so much, that I bought one for my husband's boss, and my Mom for Christmas. We all LOVE it!My husband uses it every morning before work at 4am and then I turn around and use it again for the kids breakfasts. The only thing I wish is that it had multiple egg and toast cookers for larger families...but it still goes fast. I have no REAL complaint.I read the directions once and pretty much that is it. Make sure to run the toaster through it's first initial run without food (per directions) so that you get rid of the plastic smell first.It is simply amazing!"
1,Unreliable,"This is a great design and a very useful appliance - when it is working.I like it so much, that I have purchased four of them in the last year or so, in hopes that the manufacturer will be able to build one that is reliable.No such luck; my latest worked three times before failing. The others lasted from almost three months to about a year.I am giving up - returned the last one for a refund!My advice - avoid this machine.Dr. H."
5,Easy and Delicious! It earned a spot on my countertop!,"This works as promised! One of the nicest parts is how the egg and muffin are done at the same time. Very neat invention. Its a little large, but i love it so much that it earned the right to stay out on the countertop!Cooks a yummy breakfast within 5 mins, no need to stop at the fast food joint in the morning now!"
1,Died - One function at a time,"It took all of 6 months before the first thing broke. One day the hard boiled egg function just didn't work. Then a month or two later the entire egg side of it stopped working and it was down to being a basic toaster. Within 6 months after that the toaster function didn't work either. It wouldn't heat up, the lever wouldn't stay down, nothing. I was pretty disappointed!"
5,Love this!,"Had a friend tell me about this toaster and egg poacher and said they loved it. So, I seen it on sale at Amazon and purchased it and it arrived in two days. Our family loves it! We have made hard boiled eggs and they turn out great! We have made poached eggs. Our favorite is making the egg sandwich, everything is done at the same time and we like the egg scrambled. Very easy to use and we are eating a much healthier breakfast in the mornings when we do not have much time. My eight year old daughter even makes her own sandwich since it is so easy to use. I am glad we found this and I know what I am getting everyone for Christmas this year!!"
2,Cool idea,"I don't like the fact that this is made out of plastic. The funny thing is that my egg tray is made out of plastic, which means that my poached eggs are cooking in all the chemicals and odors you smell when you open the box. I read a review that indicates the tray that holds the egg itself is made of metal, but mine is made out of plastic. Does anyone have more information about this? I wonder if there are different models/versions."
2,"Excellent Idea, Horrible Execution","The product is a good concept, but the workmanship is awful. Makes fine egg and sausage sandwiches but the egg steamer quit working on perhaps the 20th time I used it. The toaster portion decided to die shortly thereafter. Terrible build quality, i'm returning it for a replacement."
4,Toaster Love,"I'm giving it 4 stars because I had to buy the identical toaster after only 5 years with the old one and I don't think toasters should die after 5 years. But we use it everyday. We poach eggs in it at least 4 times a week and hard boil eggs about once a month or so. It's amazing! The eggs come out perfect. It makes for a tidy clean up. Hopefully, my new one will outlast the broken one by a few more years."
3,Did not last long,"Although this product does a good job and we enjoyed it, it died on us less than 6 months after we purchased it. It was only used a couple of times a week and I would have expected it to last much longer. We had to purchase a 2nd one and hope it lasts longer this time."
4,"Love it, but only last about 2 or 3 years","I just purchased my third one, They work great until it gave up. First one the toast wouldn't work after two years and the second one the egg cooker give up after 3 years. For the price now, I was willing to buy another one. I use the egg cooker about twice a week and toaster every day, so I feel I have gotton my money worth with each toaster purchased and will buy another one when this one gives out."
1,Dangerous in many coutries!! 120V only!,"I bought this for my wife, because it can server exact what my wife need for breakfast: Two slides of toast and one egg.However, the toast got burned in a few seconds after the toaster was turned on. My wife was so scared and it was so dangerous, and we had a 7 months baby in the same room.The reason of it is that it applies only to American power standard and use 120V, while Australia and many other countries use 220 - 240V. I can not find any warning or information in the product description, but ""This item is also available for shipping to select countries outside the U.S"". Why ship to Australia, if it can not be used in Australia.When I try to return it, the Amazon system told me that it was my fault and I have to pay for the return cost. How ridiculous'"
1,DON'T Overpay!!,"I search for toasters on Amazon.I come across this toaster, bought for $42.24 and shipped from Back to Basics for $6.09 S&P.;I come back two days later, and I see it selling from Amazon for $35 with FREE shipping.I don't get why this happened or how, as I now can't find this toaster being sold directly by Back to Basics ANYWHERE on Amazon."
5,An extremely thorough neuroscience review,"This book covers almost every aspect of neuroscience, in a thorough manner. It is written in a sophisticated style, but presents a wealth of material in a way that is both thorough and promotes understanding of concepts. You will not be left ignorant of much!"
3,A little slow but good setting and plot focus,This is a real good book with the action picking up through out the novel. Plenty of thought went behind this book and should veiwed by other writers as a back bone for novel write; it show the rising climax very clearly with little messages in each chapter.
1,This movie is complete scheis,"Jesus, where do I begin. Quite simply, this movie has a top 10 spot in my Rage-Cage. This movie involved complete audience abuse, I can't believe I wasted 10 minutes of my life figuring out that it was killing my brain cells one by one. How can anyone really believe that this took place at a ""space prison""? It looked more like an oil refinery in Bakersfield, CA. I bet this film project earned the director a D+ in a College of the Canyons (by SIx Flags) film class. Holy Fvking Sh!t, I would rather be sodomized by a rusty pipe than be forced to sit through this shizzat again. PEACE I'M OUT."
2,why spend the (money),...I found some of the info in this book informative but as a sufferer of tinnitus I am quite knowledgable of this condition. I thought this book might give me some new info and insight into my condition. If you don't know much about tinnitus this may be a good book for you but much of the info in these pages is already out there online.
4,Where was the editor?,"As a forensic psychology student, I have found this rare case deeply interesting and tragic. The authors excellently recount the facts and chronology of the Bernardo-Homolka case, with a satisfying level of accompanying detail. However, I found the quality of editing, along with quite a few grammatical errors, disappointing. Overall, an absolutely excellent book."
4,"Content 5, Editing ZERO","Fascinating story that is told, very in depth and detailed. I love the way these authors are able to unveil every character in this horrific story, which gives the reader a realistic view into the lives of all the people surrounding Karla and Paul.The editing in the Kindle version is atrocious! The book is literally littered with so many grammatical and spelling errors that you have to re-read entire paragraphs to get the meaning. I feel that this, in itself, distracts enormously from the story line. I give this book a 4 based on this! I can forgive an occasional typo, but I found myself getting so annoyed with the thousands of typos and punctuation errors which lead to grammatically incorrect verbiage. PLEASE re-edit the Kindle version for future readers."
3,Slow going but worth it,"Although this book was a bit slow going, I eventually got caught up in this disfunctional family's affairs. I discovered that this is only one novel of a trilogy and I think this is the last - so I read it in the wrong order. It is really well written and I could totally visualise the family members, their dishevelled lives and untidy house. I grew to care for and enjoy the characters even though their antics were incredibly frustrating. I knew it would all have to end in disaster. A good read. I recommend it."
2,"pedestrian language, boring","I was very disappointed with this book. The story should have been interesting, family dynamics, alcoholism, London in the nineteen-seventies....but the language used was uninspired and very, very flat. I did read it to the end, hoping it would improve at some point and that the prose would come to life, but wish I hadn't wasted my time."
4,Good or Bad???,Today my friend borrowed this book from his friend and asked me some questions in there like The Stranger which was real funny. I had no idea what the answer was and he told me and I started to crack up. I gave it a 5 because it gives me some good laughs. Get it if you like Solving Mysteries.
1,Too general....,"Can't really get any useful information out of this book. For example, has chapters on design, and systems integration. Being a hacker (the target group), I know more about this than the book does. The book however does not really tell how to manage these issues, which is what the book was supposed to be doing in the first place....(book about pm, not about design)."
5,Weber 9859 Premium Gas Grill Cover,A quality cover that fits very well. Made of a durable vinyl cloth which has vents in it to allow the grill to dry. Velcro straps on the ends help secure the cover during high winds.
5,GREAT COVER-UP,"The Weber 9850 Premium Gas Grill Cover is a perfect fit for the Genesis Gold C. I had received the grill as a freebie using American Express points. I wanted to protect my new grill and thus I ordered this grill cover. The fit is excellent. During a recent hurricane in this region, the cover remained intact and kept water off the grill. Great product."
3,Confused now.,"I was considering buying this cover for my new Genesis Gold B, but after reading the reviews it sounds like the cover itself is good but the vent isn't designed very well. If they wanted to let moisture out but keep rain, etc., from getting in, looks like they could have put a cover piece over the vent with something like ridges sewn vertically in the mesh to keep it slightly ""out"" at the bottom so rain would run down and over it, not inside. I think I'll wait awhile to decide what to do now. Thanks for your comments."
4,Worthwhile and important...,"This is an important documentary. Several of the authors interviewed (John Gatto, Henry Giroux, Alfie Kohn, Pat Farenga, etc) really make the film. Underneath the areas examined by the film (psychiatric drugging of children, the repercussions of industrial education, teaching to the tests, conditioning kids to submit to authoritarianism, etc) lies eye-opening support for concepts like critical pedagogy, deschooling, and unschooling. A must-see for parents and teachers alike. Occasionally just a bit dramatic - but nonetheless a very worthwhile documentary. The film won't disappoint. In the same genre is 'Waiting for Superman' and 'Race to Nowhere'. Overall 'The War on Kids' is an excellent introduction into examining why we should look hard at how we are treating our children."
1,very extreme,"Although I did agree with parts of this documentary, I found it to be full of haunting images of children being mistreated, and extreme scenarios played out to look like every day. I do not watch fear based extreme conspiracy videos for a reason."
5,Factory parts - what's not to love,"Fit perfect in my Genesis, work great, made a real difference in flare-ups (my originals were pretty worn out)."
1,Intellectual Farce,"This lady is one of those typical ""mainstream"" economists who thought she got it but in fact didn't know what she was talking about when it comes to Federal Reserve and its impact on economy. A brainwashed mouthpiece who had been indoctrinated by her statist interventionism economics professors in college and business school, she will do more harm than good doling out any economic advices.Watch this CNBC clip recorded back in June 13, 2006 in which she debated Peter Schiff on inflation and Fed's policy impact. Have you been to Detroit lately, Ms. Swonk? How's that economic efficiency been working all these years? I wonder why she is still having a job.[...]"
5,Very pleased!,We purchased this unit to replace an older model Swingline 3 hole punch which we had used for many years (office setting - moderate/high use). Since our previous model worked so well we decided to stay with the Swingline brand and have been 100% happy with this new model. Punches are good and clean. Stick with 20 sheets at a time (or less) and this unit should last for a very long time.
4,It does what a typical PDA should do,"I needed a replacement Palm/PDA since the screen of my previous one cracked.Instead of paying extra for a data package for a smart phone just for general day planning, a PDA is better suited for my purposes.I use it for the calender, scheduling, memo, and todo lists. It is small enough to carry around.I do not have many pictures on it since the hi-def will shorten the charge considerably. Same issue with games.This item is good for those who prefere PDAs over smartphones (pretty much the difference in having a data plan, phone, and easy internet access)"
5,Merry X'mas Larry,"I particularly enjoyed the pictures in this book -- especially the one when Larry was little holding his good brother. He continues to hold various things and people that are dear to his heart. I also like the fact that Larry starts to think about philanthropy, not just as competition to Bill Gates, but as something he wishes to take active control of. It is about time. Melanie Craft is beautiful, although I prefer her sleepy-eyed look in the past over her eyes-wide-open look nowadays. It is a gift to be able to stay by Larry's side for so long."
3,My remote key,"First, the key has to be send twice as in the first shipment it didn't arrive.Second, I had to change the remote device inside the key as my car is Honda Pilot and appaently the remote was for Honda Civic or any other model."
5,Fits like a glove--,My great new Weber Grill is well protected this icy winter. The cover is well made and fits well. I'm very pleased as it stays on doing its job in winds and storms.
4,Good and Durable for the most part,"We have had this cover for about 2 years. I live in the Northeast and my grill stays on the deck all year around. The Weber cover fits my grill well and has survived with only minor tears as of this summer. Overall, I was very impressed with the product."
3,Soaring and snoring,Leading off with a long highlight proves interest will wane afterward when the energetically gentle approach offers partially evocative but languid follow through.
2,Excellent Textbook,The textbook is required for my doctoral studies in nursing. It is an excellent resource and I highly recommend it to any graduate or doctoral students.
5,pleasant flavor,"When I need to use Tum's, I don't want a flavor that is going to make me more nauseaus (sp?) or queasy. For me, this flavor is mild and pleasant. Basically, it doesn't make me feel worse."
5,"Cheap, but good","I've used this mouse for 4 or 5 years now. At home, not at work. First with an old Compaq notebook, now with my iMac. It's cheap, it's very light, and it still works great after all this time. I've probably spilled a drink or two around it, but that hasn't slowed it down. It's quite the work horse. Two buttons plus a third button as a clickable scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is quiet and feels good, even though it's not a fly wheel. Unless you're a gamer, I would whole heartedly recommend this mouse. And for that price, it's got to rank among the best values of any product I've purchased."
3,a sad disappointment,"I bought this mouse to replace an older mouse-in-a-box which I have always loved but is showing its age. But although it has the same name and model number (72123), it is not the same mouse. The minor design changes don't matter. What _does_ matter is that my computer does not recognize the new version as a Kensington mouse, so I can't use all the wonderful MouseWorks features. Naturally I had the first mouse replaced, but the second one behaves no differently. Meanwhile, on a brand-new new Mac I can still use the original MouseWorks software-- but only with the decrepit old mouse."
5,The ultimate Patsy Cline collection,"If you want one CD with all the hits and more, this is the one. It's too bad that Patsy Cline set the standard so high, because no one can seem to even get close! Makes a great dinner date background music record, also.!"
5,This is the one!,"If you can only buy one Patsy Cline CD, this is it. All of her biggest hits are here, as well as a few of the minor (but no less important) ones. I've had the cassette and record album versions of this compilation for years and was thrilled to find it on CD. Patsy Cline was the best; this collection shows you why!"
3,Okay but could be better,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. The illustrations are too chaotic for very small children to relate with, I find. I also have some problems with the more sensitive parts of the text, which seem to address adoption issues but do so almost dismissively and overly lightly. There is definitely too much focus on the adoptive parent's story rather than the child's story. Although that can be useful, it can be done much more creatively in ways that children can relate to more, such as in The Red Thread. Despite that, it gets three stars because adoption is a tough topic and anyone who tries reasonably deserves one credit. I still use the book, I just change the wording a bit and that is always possible."
1,"Get me a fact-checker, please!","I couldn't get past page 13, where the author does not question her interviewee (nor did the editor, apparently) when he states that Jomo Kenyatta was assassinated. Jomo Kenyatta died in 1978 of the lingering effects of age and several massive heart attacks. Such an egregious -- and easily fact-checked -- error makes me wonder if the entire book is made up."
1,should have handed his ideas to a better writer,"Stewart has some interesting math to give to the common person, however he isn't very good at setting it down. His jokes are horrible, and his narrative is slow. It is written as if he is giving a lecture in tag-team mode between the protagonist Vicky and her guide the Space Hopper.After reading Flatland, I had hoped this sequel would live up to the sort of lofty ideals and imagination of Abbott's work. However, just as the people in Victorian England, Stewart immediately shrugs off the possibility of any higher spatial dimension than 3, and proceeds to merely give lectures on topology and geometry through bad puns and tiring dialogue."
3,Typical Homosexual Movie,"I bought the movie because I was a fan of one of the actors. I found the storyline typical pro-homosexual; ""We can do whatever we like and when we offend someone--THEY have to back off."" Sadly, you cannot walk into a cowboy bar and hit on them without suffering some type of reprisal. The movie was obviously slanted to, ""Feel sorry for Sheppard"" and ""How evil herosexual males are.""Even though the movie was supposed to be non-fiction, I believe a lot was left out that would make Sheppard look bad.I give the movie three stars because the actors and the script writer got their point across, not because the social agenda taken."
4,Nicely done,"This DVD was purchased because I decided to revisit the story of Matthew Shepard and had never seen the movie. I found it dramatic and well done, although as always I thought there was a bit more liberty taken with some of the details of the story than I would have wanted. One significant place where I believe there was unnecessary overemphasis was the conflict between Judy and Dennis concerning whether or not to demand the death penalty for the second defendant. In Judy's own account, there really wasn't that much conflict between them, and when the details of the eventual plea bargain were presented, logic indeed indicated that it would be far preferable to avoid the long appeal process and attendant publicity that death penalty sentences involve."
1,Another CD for Disney to Cash in sum bucks!,"Ok, Disney, ya didn't learn your lesson with Cinderella & Friends, you had to make another double dipper, money hungry, to short, already have all these songs, CD?What gives?Disney also had never to add some songs from Cinderella & Friends lol. How cheap and not thinking of our customers are we?SKIP THIS CD!You already have these songs on another Disney CD! :/"
2,"Interesting Character Study, but Lacking Substance","This was an interesting character study of three bisexual Christians, but it didn't really have a whole lot to say about bisexuals in the church. The three individuals interviewed appeared to be in fairly contemporary and progressive church communities and seemed to be doing just fine fine for themselves. This documentary fails to get a feel for those who are marginalized because of their sexuality. The first interviewee touched on this a little bit, but it was more of a side note. If I had watched this not knowing the reality of how non-heterosexuals are treated in most church communities, I would think everything was just fine and there wasn't any issue. It was nice to hear these three tell their stories, but it's not representational of most churches as a whole and never really got to the issues at hand."
3,A deadly style,"Sarah Smith has possibly the most annoying writing style I have ever encountered in a popular novel. Certainly, it has to be unique among mystery writers. I found myself skipping paragraphs on almost every page, and every once in a while a passage would have me positively gritting my teeth. The prose is so obtuse it's difficult to grasp what's going on at least some of the time. The motivations of most of the principal characters are unconvincing and never adequately explained. The period is fairly well described, although at least one or two details are open to question.Despite all that, Smith has concocted a fairly interesting story with a pretty good ending. She has a good eye for detail, which occasionally enlivens what would otherwise be a pedestrian descriptive passage. My advice: read a few pages of ""The Vanished Child"" before you before you fork over your hard-earned."
2,Not as pictured,"According to the picture the spider has some sort of stone be it fake or otherwise. When I got my wig the spider was not attached and was this very cheap plastic black spider. Also you may need to trim the bangs a little bit to get them too look as great as they do in the picture. Mine has straight bangs and a clump of hair that hangs below that in the middle, no tapering."
3,didn't last,very nice at first but rusted out very quickly. only lasted 2 seasons so very disappointed.
4,GOOD ONE,Good cd and the dvd is cool too. Interesting to see how a cd is made. Saw them in the OC and liked them. Cd has a good range of song types.
3,Terrible shipping,"They're brass fasteners. And they work.But they were shipped poorly, in a too-thin Amazon-box that in no way protected the red & white box in the picture. That box had broken open and the postman even thought that the contents were broken and should be returned unopened.Plus, Amazon hasn't replied to my critique of the shipping (which they solicited).You're better-off buying from somewhere else than Amazon. Unless of course you WANT to store your brass fasteners in one of Amazon's too-large too-thin cardboard boxes."
1,There are NO remixes on this CD,"Because there is only ONE CD and too many tracks, please note that there are NO remixes on this CD, there are only EDIT REMIXES.All tracks are about 3 or 4 minutes instead of the 8 minutes remixes that are available in some Maxi-Singles.I will sell the one that I have."
3,A Daring Journey,"Yvonne has brought out the magic of travel thrills and perils, especially when travelling in Africa, matter-of-factly. The personal travelogue is never boring egging you to finish the book. Yvonne's determination in the face of many odds she faces in Ghana and Nigeria while travelling to towns and cities across the borders is remarkably brought out....An interesting read."
1,My mouse laughed at it,"Out of 6 attempt to catch a mouse with various techniques and baits, zero were successful. This is no trap, it a joke."
3,Mine works,I know I'm infested but I caught 8 in a short bit of time.3 today. I on;y have 3 traps. I really need more. Easy to set up and all that.I wish there was a mouse window though so I could check it out. I released 7 of them accidentally so far!!:p First live trap I've tried though.
4,Such Good Boys,"This book was better than average. I was completely surprised that the jury didn't take into account the suffering these boys (particularly the oldest) were subjected to. Did they really think without any ""safe place"" to go or help from family that they would grow up to live normal lives? I am surprised something like this didn't happen to the mother earlier on. These boys, again particularly the oldest one, didn't stand a chance, and as heinous as the crime was, I still feel for these young men. They were the real victims here! And NO........I am NOT a bleeding heart liberal, and YES I believe in the death penalty."
3,Those poor kids,"I really felt sorry for the two sons in this book. It's horrible the life they led, and shameful that nobody in the mother's family ever took the trouble to find out about what was going on and step in.I think they were justified to a certain extent in what they did; however, their cold and callous actions after the fact is probably what sent them to prison for such a long time.Definitely not the best-written true crime I have read, but an interesting story."
3,The dirty socks,"This book that I am reading is ""The plant that ate dirty socks."" It's about a boy that is very messy his name is Michael and he's brother is a neatness nut because he's room is very clean I mean very clean but Michael is very dirty like he's room is like a dump.This book that I rate is #3 stars because the author didn't write that good and didn't use good words but the character is cool because Michael his room is like a mess and his bro is very clean like my sister. I just like the middle parts and the start but the ending I can't tell what is going to happen in the ending but if you want to figure out by your self, you are going to have to read it for your self!"
2,Wrong grasscatcher model.,"I bought a grass catcher for my Toro lawn tractor, made by the Arnold Corporation. Model:OEM-190-602. Today, i tried to install it! First off, the framework was bent, where the liftable hood is screwed on! After much pulling in the bench vise, i finally got it to close! After that, i tried installing the tube and collector thing that goes on the deck! The rubber bungees were too long! Then the bungees that hold the tube parts together were too long! And the tube was too long! And the name was wrong: ""Fast attach""! And, the hood wouldn't open far enough to get the grass bags out! So, i guess i'm stuck with the thing, or i have about 10 hours of modifications to make it fit! The place where i bought it sent two ""scalawags"" out to install it, but 10 minutes later, they threw their hands up, tossed the pieces back into the box-and LEFT!So, what do i do now? Please advise!Thanks: Rusty Jones"
3,Read another book to be able to read this one,"I bought this book to learn VBA. Though luck! It assumes a working knowledge of VBA. It does not follow a certain logic. I am reading two more resources just to be able to follow the book. If you are very good in VBA, than this book is fine, but then again, why would you need a book in that case..."
5,Passionate and moving,I bought this book for a friend of mine. It was a perfect mix of art and words. The Picasso's are perfect for the lyrics. I have a few of these books and they are nice for any art lvoer's collection.
2,For the beginners...,"It is clear that Sting loves Picasso's Art but this book is not but a small step in the very long path trought the human heart that the two atrists shared in so many points.Just a blink: a little thing that doesn't show the glory of Sting and Picasso. Quite an artificial mirror.Let's continue searching, we will find a much greater treasure."
3,"Cute, but not exactly high quality","Very cute, but the center clasp is thin pleather and seems like it will break at any moment"
1,Size is WRONG,"The size chart says ""bust 53-55"" however i'm holding the fabric in my hand and it measures 38 inches. There is NO WAY a 3x-4x will EVER measure 38inches around the bust i'm a seamstress and tho i can fix this outfit with time and fabric it is a 1x at best not a 3x not even a 2x so if your chest is smaller than 37 inches this might fit you if you buy the biggest size if not don't waste your money."
2,The Mullet Run low grade sequel to Jetty Man,"Having grown up in the Beaches area of Eastern Duval County at roughly the same time as this ""trilogy"" takes place, I was drawn to the jacket brief of the first installment, Jetty Man, and found it to be fun reading due to crucial conflicts and riveting characters. But the lastest installment, Mullet Run, does nothing to add to the development of the original characters in the first of the series. Try as I might, I could not get into the one-dimensional story line, which I found to be increasingly boring. It is so bad, in fact, that I could not even finish the book. If I never hear about the ""Mary C Mo-Jo"" again, it will be to soon!"
1,Illiterate perv,"Oh my God, this guy was a principal at a school??? Around kids??? EWYEWWW!!! IF you can overlook the total illiteracy of this writer, who has no excuse for it, then the ongoing so-called sexuality of the characters will make you gag. It isn't pulp sex, good erotica, literate sex, it isn't even interesting. It's just plain gross. His sentences often have nothing to do with the previous paragraph, he jumps from character to another scene to conversation without any coherency, and his grammar is astonishingly bad for a so-called educator. I agree with the other reviewers that his books can turn your stomach, and are a crying shame. Mayport was a very interesting place, with loads of history and a strong community. It has very little resemblance to the pervs and sadists he depicts. Don't waste your money."
5,Not your average serial killer novel...,"After years of reading George Pelecanos, James Lee Burke, John Harvery, George V. Higgins, Raymond Chandler, Ross Thomas, and others who can turn a phrase while inducing me to turn a page, I've finally started reading Ken Bruen. ""Blitz"" introduced me to a world so sloppy and hungover it feels as real as anything the aforementioned writers have created.Here's the 3rd person narrator on Brant, one of the protagonists: ""Brant considered asking her for a ride but she looked the deep type. She'd have issues and want to talk after. He hated that."" Sharp, politically incorrect, perfectly believable. And the killer, who decides to create his public persona as a vicious murderer who only takes out cops? A complete, drunken screw-up.Bruen is the real deal. The most exciting thing about finishing ""Blitz"" was knowing that he's written a shelf and I'm just starting him."
3,It is not that good but it is ok,"The sheet is smoky, not a clear sheet. It is ok for us because it is a very good price."
5,Real R & B for people who are looking for it,"As most of you know the R & B scene has not been up to par lately. I found that DAvid Ryan Harris album Bittersweet provided that rhythmic, chill, vibe that you got from the Maxwell cd.Its R & B for real R & B lovers like myself.The album, Bittersweet, is one of those albums where you hear a song once, don't think much of it, next thing you know your singing the same song in the shower. Becomes your favourite.I would definitely recommend this album to people."
1,It does not remove fingerprints,"This product does not remove fingerprints which really dissapoints me because my screen has some on it, and I didn't want to use chemicals to clean it, but I had no choice. This just cleans dust."
3,Not for computer screens,"I bought this cloth to clean a glossy computer screen and was expecting a perfect finish but this cloth leaves small droplets on the surface you are cleaning, no matter how hard you wrung it out. This is most likely due to the small dots on the cloth that help removing the dirt. It may work better on a matte screen or TV. If you also intend to clean a glossy computer screen you may want to try a lens cloth or chamois cloth instead."
5,The Best of Gilad,"I own 7 different DVDs of Gilad (Bodies in motion, total body sculpt, ultimate series). Working out with him for about 3 years. This is my favourite DVD out of all. I am not fan of aerobic parts and not interested in very intensive arm and leg muscules training. This DVD has a lot of abs!! and its great for me. After 1 year of working out with this DVD i added weights to most of excercises and it works perfect to me. Not too hard and same time not too easy. I would suggest start with this DVD to any beginner who's not interested in aerobics :)"
3,Great workout,I love it but I find because my back is weak it bothered my neck. Will continue this workout when I have more strengh in my neck and back.
2,Disappointment in quality,"This ""Paddington"" was clearly not the bear he used to be. My sons (now aged 42 & 38) loved their bear for several years until he fell apart at the seams. This one is rather stiff and not very soft. I bought him for my granddaughter to hold while I read her the book, but I don't think he will be well received. Sad how things change."
5,Christmas,Bought this for my husband for Christmas it was his favorite childhood guy. Thank you it brought many good memories back for him
5,"The Penis Book - A ""Must Have"" for your collection","While in DC last month I saw this book in a store and purchased 4 copies. I read the book and found it completely entertaining, yet informative. It is amazing to me how the penis rules the mind of a man. The book is full of interesting facts and I learned alot. I am going to purchase several more for gifts. I signed the books I gave away. ""In the end, they are all dicks. Some are just more special than others."" How true!"
5,"Witty, intelligent and informative. A great gift idea","Mr. Cohen has written one of the wittiest books I've ever come across. Packed with humor, but also with intelligence and information, this book is one that should be on everyone's gift list. A real bargain at the price, too."
3,Just okay,"I am a fan of Jon Vickers, and I often enjoy Scotto's recordings, but here Vickers is not in best voice (sounds like he has a bit of a cold), and Scotto does too much of her piano, so she is hard to hear quite a bit of the time. Only MacNeil is in magnificent voice in this recording. And the make-up and costume department were determined to make Vickers look ridiculous - I did make it through the Act three confrontation between Otello and Desdemona, and it was quite powerful, but after that I quit, because I have a much better live recording with Vickers from the Met with Zylis-Gara, and Quilico, where everyone sounds great, and if I want to watch a video of Otello, I would much rather see Domingo."
4,Post-survivor -- not so sweet,"Recorded at a concert only a month after recording the epic ""Survivors' Suite"", this is a curious blend between parts of that album and the repetitive elements of Jarrett's solo piano recordings. For much of the concert, there is no indication that the rest of the band is there. This is definitely not The Survivors' Suite Live.In summary, it's something of a disappointment. It took ECM three years to release this CD, and I can only guess that the company was unsure as to the LP's merits."
3,Not enough coverage of VSS or the PDW,"On both of the exams for Visual Basic 6.0, there are numerous questions about Visual SourceSafe and the Package and Deployment Wizard. You will need to have a through understanding of these in order to pass the exam. This book gives the basics but does not go in to great detail on these subjects. I would recommend James D. Foxall's ""MCSD in a Nutshell"" and the Transcender courses if you are really serious about your certification. Visual Basic 6.0 is still the main development environment at many companies. You want the best training and education you can get. This book is about average. This book is OK if you use it as a supplemental book to the other study guides."
2,redundent information,"One book for 70-176 is worth 155 FF, one book for 70-175 is worth 155 FF, the two books together aren't worth 310 FF.These two books are almost the same.Gu Jinhua"
4,It's bubble wrap!,"It is bubble wrap and it is in a nice convenient package. If you open the box by using the directions on the side, you just pull out the bubble wrap as you need it. ( kinda' like a tape dispenser, only this is bubble wrap) I am slowly packing up things for the house, such as knick knacks and items in the kitchen. So far, so good."
3,Not so much....,"The baskets are cute and the liners you purchase seperately do fit and look nice. But, the baskets themselves are really cheap. They flake off large pieces and the edges are so sharp, they will stab you. You can't set them on nice furniture, or it will scratch the furniture to death. I would spend just a bit more and get nicer baskets."
4,Worth a shot,"I doubted these would work after reading the comments but first night both caught and killed mice. Of course, rats would laugh at these things. But they worked for me and they're cheap. What have you got to lose? The best part is I can set them myself and don't have to wait around for a guy."
4,For the squeamish,"For those of us with delicate sensibilities, these are easier to set (no startling detonations) and dispose of the dead mouse. As noted by others, though, and true of spring traps in general, usually there is no coup de grace, but a poor, struggling little animal. You need to set the trap so that it is at the end of a narrow passage (putting, for instance, a long, heavy box parallel to a wall and pushed against a corner to create a blind canyon) so the mouse cannot simply eat the peanut butter from the side and escape."
5,great traps,"These quickly and humanely kill the mice; in rare circumstances we have had mice trapped by the foot but this seems to happen with other traps too, at least these don't have the problem of missing mice that are too little (the traditional wooden victor traps do). They are easy to set with little risk of hurting yourself. They are also reusable so you don't need to feel too guilty about the plastic. Avoid the Tomcat version, have never caught a mouse in one of those. These work consistently with a little peanut butter."
2,Yuck,"As a big Hot Water Music fan, this album proved a huge dissapointment. Essentially, it is Hot Water Music without any of the roughness, fury, or unexpected hooks that made them such a powerful group. It's polished up, almost radio-friendly emo-rock that goes for the easy, predictable hooks every time and still ends up missing about half as often. There's an almost palpable effort to smooth out the vocals to the greatest extent possible, and the music itself, while reasonably technically proficient, simply sounds generic - a hollow shell of what was formerly a pretty great rock band. These punks have not aged gracefully."
3,Meet Me In Las Vegas,"This musical is overall just OK. What is noteworthy is the dance sequences by Cyd Charisse which are wonderful. The plot moves along at a average pace, the acting is OK nothing spectacular. When compared with other musicals with Cyd Charisse eg The Bandwagon and Silk Stockings both of which are great, this one comes up a little short."
4,Don't forget to pull the plastic tag out before you claim it doesn't work,"Old toner was printing grey rather then black, so ordered this. The first page printed with the remanufactured toner had a void in the center that gets worse with every page printed. But it was not a complete waste of time and money, turns out I just forgot to pull out the plastic strip that it shipped with."
1,Laser Toner for HP LaserJet,"The toner worker fine at first, but after only a few uses it now leaves strekes.Laser Toner for HP LaserJet 5P, 6P (C3903A compatible)"
4,Drum n Bass meets Industrial,"Two aging dance styles meet. A nice return to old skool Industrial sounds here with some old skool Drum n Bass spread onto the mix. 'Buried Alive' especially highlights this splicing. Nothing earth shattering, but not a step backwards either. What comes next???08-31-06: Listened to this a few more times. Industrial Incarnate. My favorite Industrial work of all time is Front 242 'Evil Off'. This is coming in a close second so far. 'The Storm' reminds me of a really great Depeche Mode B-Side. Kinda has that Dave Gahan/Martin Gore vibe going for it. I also like the fact that they didn't rely on too many samples like on 'Implode'. They get their point across without having to rip samples from every Sci-Fi and Horror movie soundtrack they can find. When all is said and done, though, in my opinion they bring Industrial music back to the way it is meant to be.\(Oh, and the CD cover? One of their best... if not the best.)"
3,A Good Read and Introduction,"I really enjoyed this book, and found it to be a good introduction to the topic. It's a fairly quick read, and the writing flows quite well. My only major complaint is the lack of maps! (I know they cost more to produce, but honestly a book detailing military operations NEEDS maps!) This book would have received a higher rating from me if it included maps!"
1,Retreat Hell!,"I own the book. I have yet to read it. But skimming it, I noticed that that author Wilson doesn't know the difference between the ""First Marine Division"" and the ""1st Marines"". The ""1st Marines"" applies to the 1st Marine Regiment, one of the 4 regiments that comprised (i.e., and also today comprise the 1st Marine Division)- the other regiments being the 5th and the 7th Marines (infantry), and the 11th Marines (artillery). It is evident that Wilson wasn't a Marine. It is clear that when he says ""1st Marines"", he means ""First Marine Division"", which was the Marine unit that distinguished itself in the famous Chosin campaign in Korea in 1950. As a former Marine myself, I think that I'd find this error disconcerting during the read. Who knows... there might be other errors, omissions, etc.; not just nomenclature but also events, etc. And if Wilson paid someone to edit his book, he should ask for his money back. Shoddy research."
3,"Basic information, but not hands-on enough","This book offers a good introduction to what you need to start your own online business. All aspects of starting such a business is covered, and after I read the book I could proudly say I knew the how's (as well as what's), and I was on my way starting a business.But there are two major flaws to this book: first, it's not very readable, and second, it doesn't give you enough hands-on information. There are superfluous step-by-step instructions on how to use FrontPage Express, but the author doesn't tell you much about building store fronts or how to accept credit cards online, two of the more pressing topics for someone wishing to start a e-business.The CD is a big disappointment. Just a collection of demoware and shareware. It is an environmental waste and makes the book a little pricier than it should be."
2,unimpressive,i realize the book says for dummies in the title BUT first off some of the things the book states about dreamweaver are not true and are not possible - i didnt open the cd because from reading the book you knew most of the cd was demos which you would have to take off of your computer in a month anyway - the only information i got from this book was basic business start up legal information - it kept referring to information i am looking for but it states it is not covered in this book but the small business internet for dummies - after reading this book cover to cover though i am very hesitant to purchase another book by this author - the information i need is probably just referenced to and really in a third book anyway - overall i was very unimpressed by this bookonly buy this book if you are BRAND NEW to the internet - like you just got online for the first time last week and think maybe making money online might be for you THIS BOOK IS FOR BEGINNING BEGINNERS ONLY
2,To basic and not enough practical guidance,"This book was clearly for beginners only. Although the book says ""for dummies"", you'd really HAVE to be a dummy to get much out of this. The book is simply too vague when talking about important internet concepts and doen't show you how to REALLY get an online business going. I personally would reccomend 33 Days to Profits by Yank Silver www.33daystoprofits.com as a much better way to get PRACTICAL advice on starting an online business."
2,Snore,"Just my opinion: I found this move that boring I fell asleep within the first 1/2 hour. If it sounds interesting, I only suggest you do not pay for it."
5,Essential Companion to DSM IV!!,This is an essential companion to the DSM IV Diagnostic Manual. It makes it easy to better understand the different Axis classifications with many different case studies.
1,BROWN IS THE COLOR,"DITTO, for the mishaps everybody is having: the lines, the customer services, the shipping labels, the reburbished recurrences, the executives, the selective CEO amnesia, NEED I say more?? I have a brand new ATI video card, and bought this CRT instead of LCD because, I have experience in gaming with these rather than the latter ones. Boy!!! going to use my AMEX extended warranty on this one. ALl I need is have an authorized repair shop declare""beyond repair"" to get my money back. Amex only need documentation. (receipts,statements etc) SAMSUNG..you guys know you have been sued before...you have patent problems too. too bad"
1,Make yourself a favor: look somewhere else,We purchased this monitor and if failed within 2 weeks. Brown flashing lines starting from bottom-right corner and getting worst with time. Turning monitor off/on corrects the issue temporarily.Got it exchanged from Future Shop (service at least was good). The new one failed within 5 months with the exact same problem! Hopefully Future Shop was sensitive to the problem and allowed us to exchange the monitor for a different model.We went to a NEC LCD 1770GX and so far so good... paid more but this is NEC and it has great reviews. Hope we'll be OK!The Samsung CRT monitors deserve a 0-star rating
3,Fairly different from the other two...,"The game can be quite punishing at times but overall, controls work fine, the selling point (building your own ship) is what'll keep drawing you back to the title."
2,Not great for multiple cables,"I'm kind of crazy about organizing cables and these ones are a little small if you're looking to organize multiple cables coming from one place. My situation is that I have a home office and I'm a nerd (software architect) so I have a pretty robust setup:-multiple monitors-2 laptops-printer-etc.on two desks....I wanted to basically wrap everything up and maybe I was dreaming, but these seemed a lot bigger when I read the description. you might get two smaller cables or one VGA-width cable through this... that's about it"
3,Not Staight Forward,"This book is complete. To the best of my knowledge it is the most complete book you can find. The only problem I see with this book is that, the author spend too much time explaining the background of the WAP protocol. Personally I care less about the historical side view."
3,$3.99 isn't such a low price for thin socks,These socks are thinner than I expected. They are also more comfortable than expected and an excellent fit. I have come to enjoy owning them.
5,Great socks,"These are really great socks. They're well-made, and the perfect weight for wearing with a knee-length skirt in fall, but warm enough to wear under a long skirt in winter. The pattern is cute, and they stretch nicely to hit just under the knee even on my long legs, over my relatively large calves."
2,Waste of time,"I know that there aren't very many books on this subject, but this book was very disappointing to me. If you are interested in the gritty details of the hoops you must jump through than this book is not for you. If you aren't sure emotionally if nursing school is right for you, or if you need a little hand holding than this book may be all right. Full of useless commentary."
5,Great alternative to lighter fluid,"We hadn't barbequed in a long time -- and so didn't have all the right accoutrement. The first time, we used that toxic Matchlite charcoal that is saturated with lighter fluid. After turning green from the fumes, we ordered the Chimney Starter and couldn't be more pleased. Works like a charm and not so environmentally toxic. Of course, the best environmental alternative is to pony up the money for a gas grill, but this is good interim step in the right direction meanwhile."
2,Do right and wrong matter?,"I found the anecdotes and analyses of the habits that hold people back to be very helpful, and it was fun to read. What troubled me was the low priority given to right and wrong. This came out especially in the description of the meritocrat (but in some others as well). In essence, their suggestion seemed to be that focusing on what's good, right or true can be detrimental in situations, and that this 'bad' habit should be overcome. It seemed a small step from something like: 'Your unwillingness to cheat will hold you back, so whatever it is that hinders your ability to cheat is something you need to get over'.I imagine the authors would say 'We're trying to give you objective advice on advancing your career, not to be your conscience.' But that doesn't sit well with me.The Jungian analysis at the end was not helpful.Again, I found the book entertaining and enlightening in many ways, but that conscience thing bothered me."
4,Super summer read - memories,This is a very good and easy summer read. Each story brings back memories. Recommend it every summer or when you feel down and need a pick me up.
5,Command Jumbo Plastic Hook,What did we do before Command Hooks were born? I use them everywhere. I don't have to worry about getting 'Scolded' for putting unnecessary holes in the wall or hearing 'you just couldn't wait' anymore. Kudos to Command Hooks.
5,great basic recipes that hold up to creative impulses,"I love this book. I've made several recipes from this cookbook, and have really been pleased. What impresses me most is that these recipes hold up well when you substitute ingredients, don't exactly measure precisely, or take half of one recipe and combine it with another. The author did her research well, so if you read through a couple of recipes, you can replicate almost anything that you'll find in a fancy cake shop at home with what you have in your cupboard. And the best part? Most recipes make exactly 12 cupcakes - perfect for a midnight snack, and so much better than from-a-box. Yum!"
4,One of the unsung bass greats' finest,"Eberhard's '70's work with Colours has gone largely unnoticed in the States, overshadowed by Weather Report and Return to Forever. It's a shame, because Colours was just as talented and more inspiring. Seriously Deep has one of Eberhard's finest solo's, demonstrating his Scott LaFaro-esque facility on the electric upright bass, as well as his melodic sense. The other musicians also turn in monstrous performances, which I wish I had time to detail. Rainer Bruinghaus is a standout -- his acoustic piano work is just flawless. A wonderful disc for the fusion fan. (And anyone else!)"
5,E X Q U I S I T E,"I bought this in 1979 barely out of my teens the same year Mitchell's 'Mingus' was released, and I was beginning to understand jazz improvisation, even as I had been listening to jazz since childhood. Somehow, Weber's ""Silent Feet"" suddenly crystallized it all for me, just as Mitchell had crystallized the synthesis of poetry and folk/jazz.As one reviewer has duly noted, there are sections of the 17:00 title tune that can bring one to tears. The interplay between bass, sax, drums and Bruninghaus' galactic piano is exceptional. While there are many celestial moments in ""Colors of Chloe"" and ""Yellow Fields"", none match, for me, the series of blistering phrasings that make up this pivotal, sadly overlooked, ECM classic.Please, please, lovers of beauty, buy this classic!"
4,Great deconstruction of North America's idea of beauty,"Excellent book. Wolf does a great job of peeling back the layers of why the idea of ""beauty"" is what it in North America today. Some may find this book daunting if they have never been exposed to some of these theories before, but it is truly a valuble read"
4,The third wave,"Naomi Wolf does an expert job defining her point of view of what is going on during the third wave of feminism. This is a good book to contrast the other historical feminist periods. However, the reader needs to keep an open mind about her point of view.Good reference book to own."
2,annoyed,So I bought this watch for a Valentine's day present and it ended up not clasping correctly so going to have to take it to a jewelry store to fix it. My girlfriend did like the watch but very frustrating that I will have to take the time to get it fixed. Keep this in mind prior to buying it.
5,A favorite toy for my kids,"My son received this toy when he was about 6 months old and loved it. It was well used for many months and every time I bring it back out, he loves to play with it again. My daughter is now 11 months old and is having so much fun pushing it around and discovering the buttons. It's been one of our favorite toys. The lights and sounds are pleasant and fun for the kids. Would highly recommend."
1,A Cheesy Waste of Money,"Don't buy this trap with the ""cheesy"" trigger. Every time I've set one, the bait gets eaten but the trap doesn't spring. Keep looking until you can find an old style Victor with the metal trigger:Woodstream #M040 Victor Metal Mouse TrapThis classic works every time. Be sure to order a good supply. Who knows how long they'll continue to be manufactured? And PLEASE, do not throw your trap away with the mouse, unless you're the type who throws away the knife after you've sliced the bread."
1,I just can't set these things,"I give up. I used to have an easy time with the old traps that had this design but with a metal tongue instead of the cheese-shaped plastic thing. You're trying to get the wire to hook under the tongue, and the friction of metal against metal under spring pressure would hold the device in a delicate but reliable set. Tricky, but it would always work after one or two tries. I can't make it work at all with the plastic version -- there's just no friction between metal wire and plastic tongue. Who thought this was a better idea? A defective product as far as I'm concerned."
2,Dreary!,"The story simply romps through the shores and hotels/motels of Ibiza, focusing on the two main caracters and their expoits. While the story is good, the art isn't much to begin with...... I was hoping for a little more realism in the art department.Dreary, just dreary."
2,To Much Work,"I purchased this item and was sorry I wasted my money. It may do fine on a lawn in a sub-divison (a very small lawn) but I live in the country and have lots of trees and that means lots of leaves. The leaf catcher does not hold much, so not even a few pushes and I was having to empty the catcher. The yard better be smooth or your gonna have to fight to push it. Needless to say this item is a waste of time and money if you live in the country. Best to buy mulching blades. Now, This item sets in my shed, new, awaiting a yard sale, to give it away for 1/3 of what I paid for it."
4,Lawnsweeper Review,"For the price a good buy. Not hard to assemble. Have to adjust sweeper setting depending on height of lawn but once it is at the right height, it does a good job."
1,Never buy this type of product over the internet,"I should have heeded the warnings from other review's.1st clue: box had been opened and taped.2nd clue: parts missing.Had my husband READ the directions AND compared parts to the parts list, BEFORE assembling the unit he would have known not to proceed. Not that I would have read the directions:)"
2,They don't make them like they used to,"I grew up pushing a large metal and canvass sweeper across my parents lawn. It swept about a 3 foot swath meticulously and is still working at 100% for my dad after 25 years. This device does not. However, what I wanted just isn't available to purchase anymore. This model is the largest push-powered leaf sweeper I could find and it just doesn't even come close to measuring up. The build quality is suspect and the bag is essentially heavy plastic. It does work, but not all that well. And forget using it if the lawn isn't trimmed. Which brings about another issue. It doesn't like picking up anything small. You know, like chopped leaves since you have to mow first. I think this is just the sad state of the transition from solid, more expensive American-made products that do what you need, to much cheaper, flimsier, more frequently replaced products that come close enough."
3,Agri-Fab 45-0218 26-Inch Push Lawn Sweeper,"This was a replacement for the original ordered. First unit did not have all the parts. Second unit was defective as well - warped plastic housing, so could not fully assemble. Decided to keep anyway, as I could modify.Would recommend this product only to those who have a level yard, and your grass is not too long. Any angle/sloping makes the product difficult to maneuver, but not impossible."
5,Super!,This is an older technique - been around awhile but not to me... I was delighted to find the book as it came highly recommended... the directions could not be better and lead you into creativity of your own. Inspirational with all the basics a beginner needs.
5,Once in a lifetime story,"This book is a wonderful bit of Hassler storytelling. If you like a book that envelopes you in the characters and their lives to the point where you hate to leave, then you will enjoy this Hassler. A heart-wrenching, middle of America, nostalgic book with a wonderful, cohesive story. It has been two years since I read it, and I still think of the characters from time to time. My favorite Hassler (second only to STAGGERFORD)"
3,a black and white history of colour,a good well written book covering history of all airlines acquired by Delta over the years. its just a shame that this rich colourful history of diffrent airline livery is published in black and white
1,useless,"This product might be great, I would never know. I paid $80 for it and it didn't come with the disc to install it. I guess the worker in China was having a bad day that day. I tried on numerous attempts to contact the company, but was deferred to leave a message on a machine that nobody checks. You can't reach anybody at their customer service. I highly recommend not buying this product."
5,They work good for me,"I've got 2 of these on my system that I use for video editing and 3-D animation. I am very pleased. The picture quality is good. I have not noticed the above mentioned 'noise' but I normally have other equipment on in the room so it might go un-noticed. I bought mine Oct 15 2004 so perhaps that problem was fixed by then.Though I never play games I have worked with some pretty high resolution images and the monitors really get the job done. Plus, they look darn good with my other equipment.The little buttons on the sides were a little quarky for me at first since I was used to front controls. They 'look' smaller than my other 2 19s (CTX and Viewsonic) but actually have just as big of viewable screen. The footprint is comparable to my viewsonic which is pretty small for a 19 in CRT and takes up much less desktop than my CTX VL950 did. All in all good monitors and I'd certainly consider buying another."
3,"Excellent for review, poor for questions","This book is excellent for experienced programmers looking for a one stop shop for reviewing for this exam. However, the sample questions are not even close to the questions on the test. DO NOT BE LURED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY IF YOU ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK CORRECTLY. (I have yet to find a book that had questions that were even remotely like those on the exam)."
3,Good questions for the 70-176 exam,I just pass the 70-176 exam and this book was the last thing that I read. It helped me enter the atmosfere of the exam but I didn't find any of the questions from the book in the real test. The book is very concise and cover more than the Mastering VB6 from Microsoft. It is not a book for learning becouse it contains almost only questions (and answers).
4,"Perfectly good, but I would suggest doing 175 first.","This book was perfectly good for passing 176. I wrote it a couple of days after 175 and passed comfortably. I would definately say write 175 first as it is the harder of the two and will prepare you for the database questions in this one. Aside from that this book covered the controls you needed to use and generally was very useful. I recommend it, again though, for the experienced programmer, not the newbie wanting to get certified quickly."
4,Great for test takers (not for learners),"If you are a programmer and heading towards your MCSD exams, the Fast Track series is wonderful. I bought both the 70-176 and the 70-175 books and I am impressed.If you are looking for a book to teach you Visual Basic 6, look elsewhere. This book is not focused on teaching the language as much as teaching you how to pass the exam.This does not mean that you cannot learn a lot from these books. I have found a lot of areas where I have taken shortcuts and fallen short. This could have spelled disaster in the testing room.Since this book is aimed towards passing the exam, the proof will be when I take the exam. However, having taken previous exams with other books, I must say I am impressed. I reserve the fifth star after the test."
3,It serves its purpose but not what i wanted,The connector that attachs the stylus to the kindle broke within a few days and since my cover doesnt have a stylus holder i am always digging in my purse for it. I would prefer a longer stylus. This one is about half the size of a pencil. This stylus does work well and performs as seller stated. It works well with the kindle but not very good on my smartphone.
3,good not great,it'll do the job for a season or two. won't last much more than that without ripping apart. light and easy to pack.
4,Grace Chapel Inn Book Series,Haven't read book yet but already have most of the Grace Chapel Inn series and LOVE each and every one of the books I've already read. Can't wait to dive into this one!
2,Just about Beds,This book is not really about bedrooms. It is really about the bed itself. There are alot of photos of beds and different bedding and headboards. There are no real photos of bedrooms themselves as a full room or suite. Therefore there is no real inspiration for designing a master suite or kids room at all. It is just a book of bed and nightstand photos. A real let down.
1,Didn't last long,The soldering was bad- it worked like a charm...once. Then the soldering came loose inside the power compartment and it had to be thrown out.
4,"Fantastic story, though badly written","Assuming the embellishment inevitable in such retellings has been kept to a reasonable minimum, this is a fantastic story, no matter how it is told. It is, nonetheless, unfortunate that it is written so poorly. Many passages of the book could pass for winning submissions to a purple prose writing contest.Why four stars? Well, the writing may make you gag, but the story is so good it's worth it, despite the turgid writing."
5,Great book!,I'm studying to be a substance abuse counselor and was recommended by my professor to purchase this book. It came quickly and the price and condition were great!!! Highly recomdeded!!
4,Great book,This book was bought for two different people and they both have raved about how helpfull it was. I would recommend this for anyone struggling with an addiction no matter how severe.
3,Yuck.,"In this book, Calwyn, who is not even a legal adult, cheats on her boyfriend, Darrow, who she supposedly loves, with the EVIL BAD GUY OF THE BOOK, who has KILLED HER FRIENDS and tried to kill her numerous times. The evil bad guy is a middle aged man with gray hair.Can you say sick?"
5,Finally...After Years Of Waiting,Finally after years of waiting Cycle 2 & 3 are finally available on DVD!! Cycle 2 & 3 are arguably the best Seasons of Top Model. Im a dedicated Top Model fan and i cant wait to get my hands on a copy!! No release date yet but hopefully soon!! Already pre ordered mine!!! Hopefully there will be extras and commentary but doubtful...im just happy itsbeing released at all!!
2,the best parts aren't there,"The book and artwork where okay. To much space was wasted on the story lines. But the most definite waste, was the ending of the chapters. Each chapter was full of the usual sex, which was good. But just when the story is about to take a very interesting twist. The chapter ends. I am so mad and dissapointed. For example when one of the guys, has to use the bathroom, and Molly asks if she can help. I am wondering what next. Some watersports, OH YEA. That idiot, end the chapter. Or when the woman comes into the bedroom dressed as a dominatrix, once again the jerk ends the chapter. I guess he is good at thinking of the idea. He just can't finish them. I was dissapointed in the book. I feel so ripped off."
3,"Not Bad, but...","Not Bad, but not as good as the first one. While the art is good, I found the story less readable than Volume 1."
4,good transaction,"I can not complain about the transaction. The book came as described by the seller, and delivered in decent time period. I will recommend him/her to any friendThk you"
3,smell,"good lotion, but smells just like sun block. the whole reason for me to purchase this lotion was to have sun block on mt kids arm during the the day....with out smelling like sun block.. i wish they could change the odor to something more pleasent. i could have just bought regulat sun block, if i had known."
4,Son likes it a lot but it doesn't do much,"This is a cute, and little toy. My son started a fascination with submarines so we searched every where for toy subs. The reviews were pretty accurate after I got it. Decided to order anyway because of the bright color. It doesn't do much but it is a cute bath tub toy with an imagination."
4,"Yalom, the master therapist","As a therapist I have followed Yalom's work for many years. This book, while not his best is an excellent primer on group therapy as well as philosophy. Having just finished ""Momma and the meaning of life"", I was a little disappointed, especially at the conclusion of this novel. However, for anyone interested in the process of group therapy and the philosophy of Schopenhauer, it is a worthwhile read."
4,Worth the money.,"The book is well written and contains a lot of useful information.The reason for 4 stars, and not 5, is that the illustrations are not totally clear in some areas. They are primary simple line drawings and require some study, and knowledge before hand to interpret. This is only a minor shortcoming."
3,eh...,so i have played all the other csi games and i remember loving them. unfortunately this game was soooo easy i couldnt even it for a second. i regret ordering it early and i would say dont waste your money on it until its really cheap!
3,It works if you use it right,"Before I get into how it makes you sleepy, let me just tell you that I always have the most vivid and interesting dreams when I take this, Im going to try lucid dreaming tonight lol. But it works, just take it and actually go to bed."
1,I would give this product negative stars if possible,I feel very sleepy and very ripped off. If I wanted to constantly wake up during the night I wouldn't take a sleep aid.
3,Nice well made but boring,"I'm so sad my nephew didn't care for this toy at all! it is really cute and have nice details. But he really, really never play with the toy!"
3,"The casual listener should buy ""Absolutely the Best"" instead","It's hard to choose between ""The Singles Collection"" and the one disc ""Absolutely the Best."" TSC may be more than than a casual listener needs of this group. If you need all the forgettable B-sides here, you're a candidate for the ""Zombies Heaven"" box that has everything they ever did. On ATB you get three of the very best Zombies songs that are NOT on TSC: The Way I Feel Inside, I Want You Back Again, and Gotta Get a Hold of Myself. (That is, the best songs before their great ""Odessey & Oracle"" album - get the 30th Anniversary Edition!)"
2,"The album is excellent, the remaster is crap","Please note that this is a comment of the REMASTERING job of this CD. The original always had a very dry, cold sound that fit the music very very well. I know that Guthrie is not a fan of his earlier albums, and on all 3 early records (this one, Head Over Heels, and Treasure) he seems to have run with the technology available to re-create instead of just simply remaster. The CD suffers because of this. Whereas the original Garlands was appropriately flat - this one sounds like the album was recorded in a tin can. I'm very glad I held onto my original import edition of this - which also is sadly out of print due to this monstrosity. (Two of the bonus tracks, first issued on a flexidisc, on the original import have been axed, and do not appear on anything else) ... Keep your old Capitol or (old) 4AD editions ... or get the vinyl. Just upsetting."
1,Poorly researched,"The book is erratic and totally misleading from a Red Cross perspective. Although there are some real gems in this book its far too large and copious and the historical interpretation is biased toward the red cross and barely mentions any thing about the ""tainted blood"" scandle that's absolutely critical to the history of the RC. There's nothing here that even mentions the war time record of the red cross, the partnership with the St John organization or the contribution the red cross has made in the social fabric of the western world - in fact the author condemns the St John Ambulance with weak and inexcusable exhortations about ""who's better"" (shame shame). There isn't anything substantial about the VON either. The book is sickly sweet and doesn't even come close to a good, historical account of the origins of the war effort for a voluntary service organization in the british tradition. blah blah blah..."
3,Was she ever happy?,"Was this woman ever happy? Not according to this book. I hope it's just a misrepresentation by the author because of not, it's very very sad. The only time it seemed that Anne wasn't miserable was when she was having an affair - intelectually, emotionally, or physically! It just goes to show that money does not equal happiness. I pray that I'm wrong and that Anne has had - and DOES have - some peace in her life. She definitely deserves it."
2,A disappointing treatment of a fascinating subject,"By reading the notes in the back of the book, it's obvious that Susan Hertog painstakingly researched her subject, and presented her story sincerely. Unfortunately, Ms. Hertog was unable to craft a narrative that carries the reader through Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life.The book lacks narrative--it's more of a dreamy account of significant events in Mrs. Lindbergh's life. There are lots of gaps; lots of unanswered questions. And throughout, Ms. Hertog tries to make the reader sympathetic to Mrs. Lindbergh's fate. In the end, I tired of reading about the poor little rich girl who married a hero and couldn't enjoy the wonderful life given her."
3,Not the Best,Received the book 5 days after the specified date of arrival. Was not in as great of shape as comment box said it was in. Disappointed.
4,Love it!,"I love this item - it isn't made to measure flour and stuff like that...instead it can be used to measure peanut butter, mayo, ecetera."
3,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","I am usually a big fan of Pampered Chef products, and have about half their catalog in my kitchen. This item, however, is one of my least favorite.The basic idea is a good one: have one measuring tool for liquid as well as dry items. I also liked the idea that sticky items like peanut butter or honey are easier to remove because you simply push them out. That all being said, the concept sounds better than it works. For one, the cup is very narrow, and that makes it difficult to clean the bottom corners of the inner cup. Also, disassembling it is not always easy. The inner cup fits very snug, and the outer cup is too narrow for a whole hand to fit in to put push the inner cup out of the outer cup. I would like to see this cup redesigned with a wider cup and maybe a 3-cup capacity, then it would get a 5-star rating. The way it is, it only gets 3 starts: it is ok and does it's job, but it's not as user and cleaning friendly as other Pampered Chef products."
1,Seems like a good idea...,"I received this as a gift and it seemed like a great way to declutter my kitchen drawers. Unfortunately it doesn't function well. It's difficult to read the markings. Traditional measuring cups are much more accurate. Need 1/2 a cup of flour?? Well after you figure out how to get the flour into the tube without spilling it everywhere, there is no way to level off the top. It's all very frustrating. I went back to my old measuring cups."
2,Just ok...,"The ergodyne proflex wrist support has a nice compact design and doesn't extend up to your fingers like most other splints, which is why I chose it in the first place. However, I'm exceptionally glad that I ordered a large because it only just fits (I'm a woman who admittedly doesn't have dainty wrists, but they aren't huge either). I wouldn't think that many men could use this product at all! I was also disappointed that the metal support didn't curve and extend over onto the hand at all. It's just a flat metal bar that sits on your forearm up to your wrist, and it actually puts a good deal of pressure right on the area that it's supposed to protect (the carpal tunnel). If you just need a brace for your lower forearm to wrist, this is the product for you...but if you need it for carpal tunnel syndrome - look elsewhere!"
5,Best I've found,"As a retired therapist, I recommended these braces for my patients. I've worn them myself for 15+ years, and they're great. They allow for full use of the fingers, and slight flexibility in the wrist. The flexible plastic insert is sturdy, provides great support, yet has an oval cutout in the center that keeps pressure off of the carpal tunnel."
1,poor design,"Been using these for years with great success. Bought some new ones to replace frayed and beaten older ones. New product has been changed to save a few pennies in cost and increase profits without thought as to how it effects perfomance. The main body of devive is made of elastic on both old and new which gives good fit and comfort. However, on the old ones most of the velcro is sewn onto the wrap around straps which are longer. The straps on the newer version have been shortened, presumably to reduce cost and all velcro fasteners are now on the main body. Velcro does not stretch so neither does the elastic body. Very uncomfortable and must be worn loosely to keep circulation going. When worn loosely support not very good. Look elsewhere for better design."
3,For Beginners,"I got this book hoping to learn some new interesting ways to do my daughters hair. This book did not meet my needs, but I am sure it would be helpful for someone who did not know how to braid."
5,Large center channel with impressive range,"I've long been a fan of Infinity. Primarily their older lines (Kappa, Crescendo) with the Emit-R tweeters. One issue with the center channels of that era is that they don't get real low / bassy. The Beta 360 is way more of a ""large"" speaker. It gets down in the low HZ range so, you can really hear dialogue ""growl"" without having to rely on a subwoofer. But, the speaker is really big. It's not a low profile and not something you can easily squeeze below your TV. But, the size is necessary, I'm guessing for that dynamic range.Sadly, Infinity is getting more and more away from good speaker design. This center is really more of a throwback, large boxes, heavy drivers, solid sound. While their newer designs look cool and slim, they aren't as meaty sounding. So, this is sort of the last of the great Infinity designs, even as these get phased out."
1,"No door, no good","Took me wayyy longer than it should to cook one slab of ribs, since I kept having to take them out, take the grill out, take the water pan out (which resulted in disaster on my first try), and re-light charcoal. Do not buy a smoker without a door on the side for adding more coals or wood. I could not keep the temp up at all. I used the minion method to get coals lit, and I'm pretty sure I did it all properly. I got so frustrated by the end that I just finished cooking my ribs in the oven. I've never had buyer's remorse so bad before."
3,Poor shipping box method,The shipping box split apart and the unit was not round when unpacked. Also scratched up. Had to bend it back. Also there is no ...........temp adjustment control so you can not regulate the temp to 225 degrees which is a desirable smoking temp. It does work but would have been worth spending more for more extras and the inconveniences.
4,Good product,"It works as advertised. It is especially useful when hiking, running or walking on cold days. I usually keep the iPod buried under layers of clothing and the remote allows me control without digging out the iPod each time I want to skip ahead or adjust the volume."
2,the Lighter side of Hockey,"As a die hard hockey fan, and as an adult, I found this a little hard to watch. It's kind of like America's Funniest Home Videos where you have Bob Saget saying dumb stuff during the clip, all the while you're thinking to yourself, ""This host is an idiot.."".Although he is Canadian, the host Cabbie Richards seems like he's never played a second of hockey before and displays little working knowledge of the sport. He says a few words.......and then waits three seconds....... while his lines are fed to him....... through his earpiece. This gets kind of annoying! And, the humor that Cabbie supplies is super lame. Super lame.This DVD is for kids. Good footage, but not for hardcore fans."
5,Must have for Billy Joe Shaver fans.,"This is an excellent collection of Billy Joe's wonderful musical work done by him and some of his fans who happen to be outstanding performers in their own right.If you are not a Billy Joe Shaver fan, just listen and you will be."
3,Good,"Since this is one of the few OAT books out there it is better than nothing. The problem with this book is the fact that it is a little hard to read, it looks like it was typed with a typewriter. Other than that, it has good practice items in it, but don't expect to learn very much, it only itemizes what areas of each subject you need to learn (basically everything). This book is overall good because it has many practice items and help increase your speed."
2,Slow and Convoluted,"This is a subtitled French melodrama in which a grown man traces back the history of his maternal grandparents' demise during the persecutions of European civilians during World War II. While one can sympathize with this man's plight, the film itelf is a bit slow and convoluted since one has difficulty differentiating between the various family members in his past--e.g. parents, siblings, grandparents on both sides, etc. Can't recommend for the mainstream viewer."
2,Not satisfied with condition of item received,"A beautiful barbie doll but when I received it, the box had been taped in several different spots and the bottom was not attached at all.Not happy at all with the condition!!!! I have ordered several dolls and they have all been in perfect condition until this one!!!!!!!!"
4,A Great Forgotten Movie,Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds team up again after their success in Singing in the Rain to offer a wonderful comedy with great dance numbers by O'Connor and wonderful spoofs on Astaire and Kelly. A little known but highly entertaining 50's musical. Watch it and be prepared to smile and tap your toes.
5,A very cute movie,I have watched this movie over and over. It is one of my favorite Debbie Reynolds movie. It is a really cute love story.And Debbie and Donald are great in it. If you like the old MGM movies you will love this one.It is worth buying and watching.
4,Musical Debbie and Donald,"Probably the best routine is ""A Lady Loves"" and takes place before any of the movie's action, but that doesn't detract from the rest of the film. Lighthearted and endearing, ""I Love Melvin"" showcases the talents of two of MGM's talented 'song and dance men', as well as a number of well loved character actors of the era. A great pick-me-up."
2,Warner Brothers Strikes Again!!!,Way over-priced!!! Debbie Reynolds is cute and entertaining and it's a pleasant diversion-but let's face it-it's a minor musical and at 76 minutes should be packaged and not sold seperately at a jacked-up price. Again shame on the greedy folks at Warners.
4,"Good Alternative to ""Hard Core"" Workout Videos","I agree with the other reviewers that this program is a little 90s. But, Leslie Sansone prooves to be a fun alternative to the ""hard-core"" workout videos. The program is easy to follow and works up a good sweat. I appreciated that all of the participants looked like real people (not rock hard and rail thin). I use this video in the morning before work and find it easy to wake up with."
2,Try CinnaBetic II instead!,"I don't see that this product is water extracted. If it's not, it just won't work as well, from what I've read online. I've been using CinnaBetic II for a few years now along with chromium picolinate and fish oil, and since I started, my A1C reading has never been higher than 6.6, which is a point less than before I started using them. I swear by CinnaBetic II and no, I don't work for them! ;-) I'm a type II diabetic and have been for years. My doctor won't believe my good A1C readings are due to my supplements (particularly the CinnaBetic II), but I know there's nothing different I've been doing since I started taking it twice a day. Be sure whatever cinnamon supplement you use is manufactured using the water extract method, or it just won't work."
4,"Doors fans, here you go.","This is a band that deserves a lot more publicity than they are getting. They are reminiscent of the Doors, Velvet Underground, Morphine, and other dark, spacy bands. Dark and haunting most of the time, and other times a bit more uplifting. I've also heard comparisons to Echo and the Bunnymen, but not having heard much of them, I can't comment. At any rate, each song is different, and every tune on the album is well-written.Ken Griffin's lead vocals are what Jim Morrison tried to sound like on his best day, and I say that as a huge fan. According to an interview, he cut every vocal track without any edits, which is damned impressive considering how the vocals are almost flawless.What the heck is up with all those used copies for cheap? Who would want to get rid of this album? This is great stuff."
3,"Not bad, but wasn't expecting ""Christian lit""","I enjoyed the story, but was thrown off by the fact that it was ""Christian lit"". I hadn't realized it when I got the book. While that meant it had the benefit of being a romance without graphic sex, there was a bit too much ""bible"" in it for my personal taste. That said, the best parts of the book were the actual missions the SEALs went on."
1,Disapointed,"It is extremely rare that I give up on a book but this one was so unbelievable I could not stomach it. Cliche after cliche. Contrived incidents one after another to boost up and drill home the agenda of the author. I am stunned that it has recieved so many glowing reader reviews. If you like literature or are just looking for some thought provoking storytelling or entertainment, then this book is a waste of your time."
5,An Intriguing Book Without Garbage,"Dee Henderson has once again written a fascinating book. It is well written, absorbing, and fast-paced, yet contains none of the lurid details less skilled authors use to attract readers. It realistically shows the struggles Christians face when dealing with adversity."
4,Quality power metal with heavy neo classical leanings,"This album reminds me of Yngwie Malmsteen a lot, in the sense of the melodies are similar. There isn't loads of widdling on here like Yngwie though, so people who get sick of his overplaying will not find the same problem on this cd.Best Songs on here are the cool epic song War of Troy and the ballad Golden Tears."
2,hmmm...frustration,I will admit...I am writing this review in a great deal of anger. Maybe I am using this as an opportunity to vent my anger. This is a piece of garbage.Define Frustration: Spending a significant amount of time getting a good woodfire going...and the poor design of the system causes me to have to put the water pan in vertically- hard to do with the tight design and hot smoke. I spilled the pan all over my fire putting it out.GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
3,Own v6,"I'm thinking of buying this. I own v4 and recently bought v6. True, you can't import v4 into v6 or 7, but that isn't that big a deal to me, as once I print out my plans I don't need to go back to them.The only thing I was disappointed in with v6 was it's extremely limited selection of 3d models, much more limited then v4 and v4. I thought I would be able to find 3ds plumbing and other things to import, but have found no source online and there is probably nothing free. No corner tubs, only a few types of sinks, etc. If v7 can improve on that I would probably buy it just for that as it has a lot of excellent features. Much easier to import and scale scanned in floor plans, etc."
2,Mistake!,I used this book briefly to cram for NE. I did not fully read or review this book but in my short cram I found a mistake in the sample questions. An error in the sample questions in this type of publication is unacceptable. Incorrect answer - A 10BaseT network must be Terminate
1,"WHAT A WASTE OF $$ (UNLESS YOU HAVE $75,000 TO REDO YOUR KITCHEN)","This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter. The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out. The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other. Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system. Oh is that affordable? If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins. Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions. Very few pictures and all for the rich. I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family. Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it."
2,too easy,"I'm not a kid, and this game was too easy for me. Someone with quicker reflexes and nimbler thumbs would probably think it is laughably easy.I do like the RPG flavor *without* the turn-based combat -- I just do not like turn-based combat -- but playing for four hours without getting killed is a sure sign that the game is just a little too easy for more mature players."
1,Great graphics cheap and dull gamepplay,"Its like a game developed by 2 separate groups. The storyline and towns (non combat exploration) is interesting, with some superb graphics both in technical ability (long draw distance, smooth framerate) and in design with loads of color and interesting buildings, monsters and bosses.The actual gameplay in the dungeons is just plain dull. There's no advanced player skill involved like strong/weak attacks or special skills just block and hit. And the dungeons are just plain boring corridors and rooms. Disappointing."
2,2 stars only cause a small amount a effort was put into it,Let me start by saying do not listen to the reviews that the game is too easy. It just seems easy at the start that way. I do like the weapon upgrade but not when that is the only thing can you upgrade. Your defense is upgraded in the lamest way possible by finding littlt chests with pie in it. The game is 50 hours long but not worth it. The dungens as I am sure you heard are repetive bu the only thing worse than that is the battle music. It may be good with at the most 20 hours but not a second more. The only reason why I continued playing was to see happened next and it was something easily predictable. So do not I repeated do not make the biggest misake of your life.
4,review,the game is fun like the first game. you run around hacking at enimies but theres no guts or blood gushing out of the monster which sucks. the game is fun like always.
1,Do not buy!!!,Didn't fit right into the charging slot out of the box and then broke within a week.Total junk...stole my money.
4,Works great. It does not have the locking connection,"I was under the impression that the OEM Apple iPod cable had the locking connecter for the connection to the iPod. Maybe I'm wrong, but this one does not have the locking connector.Works like it should though."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I ordered 2 of these, but neither one works on my Iphone 4 or Ipad. They do seem to charge the Iphone/Ipad but do notwork for data."
5,Just what I ordered,"Cable did exactly what I hoped for - charged and synced data to my ipod. Order arrived really fast. Thanks, I will definitely order from you again if I need anything!"
1,Buyers beware!,"If the battery you're watching before you make the purchase does'nt have the interstate label on it, you're going to recieve a cheap knock off no matter what the description says. Shame on them! Mine even looks used. Will not return because it works but will never be fooled again."
1,THIS IS NOT RED,it should be advertised as MAROON. I did not need Maroon to go along with my plum Kindle cover. I would not recommend this brand and I am not buying a new one from them either.
1,Tip broke first time I tried to use it,First time I trided to use it the rubber tip feel off. Waste of money! Wouldn't recommend. Worst buy every from amazon
1,PINK NOT CRIMSON RED,This product arrived and the color was Pink not Crimson Red as stated and as seen in the picture! It would be a waste of my time to repackage and send the item back and a waste of my gas to go to the post office.
5,The best of the best!!!!,I have problems running from store to store looking for my msm in 1000mg dose. Finding this online was a blessing and the price was fabulous. The ingredients are better and will keep using this product for ever. Makes my time easier to just get online and order then calling all over and seeing if they have it in stock. Recommend highly for all vitiamins.
2,Not for me,"This gave me energy or wired me up during the day but Iwas unable to sleep at night and felt washed out andawful the next day. I read some reviews from other peoplewhere they claimed insomnia and now I know what they weretalking about. I previously took Drs. Best GlucosamineChondrotin with MSM/four capsules per day which equaled1000mg. of MSM, same as I tried taking of this product.Did not have the insomnia with it, so dont know if theingredients are different, apparently they are.Bottom line is I have to toss it out, wasted my money."
1,loose noisy tub,"lsq9549pw, this machine is only 2 1/2 years old. I wash 4 loads a week, most of them medium size. Now the tub is loose, moves freely when empty, like it's not attached. It makes a terrible noise when washing. I've seen similar problems voice by other customers on other sites."
5,This is the ROLLS ROYCE I've been waiting for,"First of all, you have to have both pieces to get the full effect. The same person who recommended ""Sex Grease"" recommended these two items. I'll never go back to battery-powered vibrators again. Again, I couldn't find either one on the island of Oahu so I'm grateful that I was able to get it through Amazon. I keep all three goodies right by my bed, along with my battery-powered vibrator, just in case there's a power outage. Heeheehee!"
4,Awesome but TOO SHORT!!,"This is an OUTSTANDING cd and easily one of the best Blaxploitation soundtracks. The instrumentals have all the elements you expect from a good funk soundtrack. It's got the great beat, the big bass lines, and that big horn sound! ""Stalkwalk"" is incredible and ""The Call"" is a beautiful slow tempo tune. The vocals are pretty weak with the exception of ""There He Is Again."" The problem is that most of the tracks are under two minutes in length. You end up wanting so much more. I would love to hear an extended version of these tunes if there was one. Very short cd but outstanding musical quality! EVERY instrumental is great! Check it out!"
2,Throw away the chain,"The pendant is very pretty and a nice size although the amethysts are very pale in color. The chain is worthless. It is thinner than dental floss and will break the first time it gets caught in anything. The clasp is very cheap and opens unevenly making it difficult to close. If you buy this, plan on purchasing a more substantial chain to wear it on."
4,fun,My 14yo nephew was showing us this trick before I even knew he opened his gift. And the other kids all wanted to do it. So thumbs up.
3,No box or instructions,"I got this as a stocking stuffer for my son who loves magic tricks. He's 8 years old and only a beginner. But the dumb thing comes as a single pen in plastic and THATS IT! No box or instructions. He's going to look in his stocking and think santa left him a plain old black pen. It does have a small slip of paper (about the size of paper you get in a fortune cookie) that lists a website you can go to and get the instructions. So, now I've got to do that and figure out a way to package this thing so he will know it's a magic trick and not just a pen. The picture made it look as though the pen comes in a green box with a title for the trick and everything. Ugh, so disappointed."
2,Great concept but disappointing quality,"I give this product two stars as an average: 3 stars for design, 1 for quality. Because most of my dishes and glasses go into the dishwasher I wanted a large open dish rack for pots and plastic bowls and containers. I don't find the ""wave"" design holds up these items very well, but there's plenty of room to stack them; the utensil basket isn't really deep enough to keep cooking utensils from flopping over, but I can live with these issues. My biggest complaint is that the stainless steel wires have rust on them! Each juncture where two wires meet has rust around it, but there's also rust at the ends of each wire. Even some of the wires have rust along the lengths with more on the underside than above. I have aluminum pots so they aren't the cause of the rust. A $50 stainless steel dish rack should not rust after only two months use...a major disappoinment!"
2,OXO Stainless Steel Dish Rack,"I bought this item a couple of years ago. I liked the way it fit my counter top. The problem that I had with this unit is the plastic part are very fragile. The cup holders on mine have all broken off. Now, the plastic ends that hold it together are slipping apart all of the time. I do not recogmend this product because it is not durable."
5,Used for kitchen funnels,These funnels nest together for easier storing. They go in the top of the dishwasher and are easy to use. A great product at any price and these are cheap.
1,Disgusting!,"I tried to use this for me and my daughters' hair. I'm not sure who this is working for but I am black and both my daughters are of different racial mixes and it doesn't work for any of our hair types. First, it SITS on top of the hair in a big white pasty glob that barely settles in even with much brushing. Second it dries our hair out horribly, seeing that the so called natural oils in it aren't at the top of ingredients, petroleum and mineral oil which are both no no's for black hair are. I can feel my hair hardening up and breaking off as soon as I tried to rub it it. It went from soft and slightly oily to dried up and stiff in one application. I am horrified that this is on the market. Ladies the petroleum and mineral oil in this is no good for your hair and trust me whenever if ever the natural oils it claims to have finally settles in your hair you'll barely have enough hair to put it on after so much breakage!"
3,shock for my Tachoe,All four shocks for my Tachoe fits good and ride better. The shipping came in just in time to replace from old weak shocks.
3,Just Okay Vampire Movie,"I would really like to see this movie remade with a better story/script. There is a pretty good idea here involving a foursome of woman vampires that just does not realize its potential. The movie drags in too many places, as pointed out by others. Scenes of the vampires ""shopping"" and lounging around are just boring. More vampire action - attacking people and drinking their blood - would have helped considerably. One of the main reasons I'm writing this review is to point out how good Anna Fischer is in her role. Her performance as one of the vampires was the best thing in the movie. I would like to see more of her work, and I hope she will get to play a vampire again."
2,why would you offer the english dubbed version?,Subtitles = great vampire film.English dub version = crap vampire filmEnglish dubbed anything = crap.4 stars if it were subtitled...... 0 stars b/c of the lame english dub
4,Enhanced children's songs,I purchased the lp version of this compact disk when it originally came out. The compact disk has additional cuts written after the original release. It is a wonderful addition to anyone's compact disk collection.
2,The Skies of Pern,"I'm a devoted fan of the Pern series as well as some of Anne McCaffreys other series but this book was a big disappointment. It was very disjointed with some characters changing drastically for no real reasonand some introduced (or reintroduced) that did not further the story line. There was no theme, just a group of individual stories that were very loosely woven together. I think this book would have been much better as a series of short stories instead of being forced into ""novel mode"". This is the only McCaffrey novel I have read in which I had no real involvement. The Skies of Pern was a big disappointment to me. I certainly hope the next book is up to the standard of the others in the series"
3,"Lacking, not well balanced & Chapter dates are off.","As one who love the Anne McCaffrey's ability to bring stories to life, so become one with the characters. One who owns all, but one of Anne McCaffrey's books. I was diappointed reading this book. A well balanced book is like counting to 10 slowly, the start, the build up before reaching 10. The Skies of Pern, started out great, then the story was like counting: 1..... 2..... 3..... 4..... 5..... 6..... 9.. 10. Two other times her books have been writen this way: ""Decision at Doona"" & ""Treaty at Doona"".Anne McCaffrey's other 15 Pern series are great, and her Crystal Singer series I have read many times."
3,Not as good as the rest ...,"I was so excited when I heard this book was comming out. I got it as soon as possible, and ran home to read it. It was not as good as her earlier works. Having solved the major PERN hazzard, Thread, in the last novel, she had to come up with a new problem. To me it was unclear how a possible random astroid would cause the planet's people to contine to pull together, and I did not feel that she answered her own delimas completly.If you love the PERN novels, by all means read this one. But I recommend borrowing it from the library, this is not one you will want to re-read numorous times."
3,Only long-time fans will need this one,"For readers who've been following the adventures of the dragonriders for years, an afternoon with F'Lessan and Tai will be well spent. Other readers (or folks, like me, who haven't visited Pern since my teen years) will enjoy the dramatic events of the tale, but will be bored by the constant shift in the point of view. A good many scenes are introduced only as a way to catch up with characters featured in other novels, and some, oddly, are simply recounted after the fact. (Tai, a main character, is set upon by thugs, but the action is ""offstage."")The language is often a bit stilted: how about this line? ""Those as hears will give a word to the wise to them as is too badly informed to know what's what!"" But all in all, a good yarn."
4,An intresting story,The Skies of Pern begins where The Dolphins of Pern leaves off. The Red Star's course has been altered and now the Dragonriders must find a craft that they can call thier own.When a metoroid falls to Pern and causes untold damage the Weyr Leaders decide that someone must always watch the sky so that if another metor falls they can keep people from dying.I won't tell the rest of the story because that would ruin the ending for those who haven't read it yet.McCaffrey is an excellent story teller though I thought that her lastest book was a bit slow.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FIRST!!! If you are thinking to start reading about Pern I recomend that you start with Dragonsdawn and go from there. This not a book you can read on its own. The characters and pot stem somewhat from what has happened in other books.This is a great book if you know just what is going on in Pern but if you haven't read any of her other Pern books you won't understand a thing that's going on.
4,The Skies of Pern,"Another Ann Mccaffrey classic! I love all her books and this one fits right in. On another note to Kent of WA review, Runners are covered in Legends 2 Short Stories By Masters of Modern Fantasy ""Runner of Pern"". Its hard sometimes to find all the short stories Ann Mccaffrey has published. I make it a habit to check all SF short story books.Hope this helps"
2,disappointing,"I thought the songs would be more soulful and creative, but they felt a little forced and unoriginal."
4,EEP 3 Railroad simulator,"Hy folks,great stuff. You can construct your own model railroad. US models included too. Otherwise european models included.Construct, build and operate your own landscape with lokos, houses and all other model stuff needed to have a nice looking railroad at your PC at home or on your notebook travelling. Don't want to construct yourself? No problem, operate the included samples!"
2,Careful - Christian oriented,"I was very disappointed to find that this book is extremely Christian and bible-oriented (bible phrases proliferate every page), despite the fact that that is not disclosed in the description anywhere."
5,fresh freedom & celebrate the amazing individual U are!,"This book takes YOU as the amazing individual you are and walks you through what life is now, and what you will be the most content doing, down to each last part of your personality traits, likes, and dislikes. It is one of the most personal books I have read ever and yet it gave me such a clear view of who I am, to celebrate it and not waste my time living other paths.Everyone should read this book ASAP.What fresh freedom and encouragement."
3,Thought provoking,"After reading the table of contents i thought this was going to be another ""God made you so you are special"" book.But Max Lucado did not disappoint when he dives into stories of people who live in their sweet spot andserving God and man and becoming saints out of doing the most ordinary things.I had known Max as the author of several inspirational quotes and this is the first book written by himthat i have read . I will be reading a few more.A sweet spot discovery guide is at the end of the book for those who wish to dive in and find theirs."
2,Boring,"Tried so hard to love this book but it just wasn't engaging/interesting/inspiring.The concept is great, but it lacks vibrancy. Too easy to put down (and not pick back up again)!"
1,No Support,"I recently purchased this program and I am very disppointed with it. I was having problems with the contact names not showing up and with the calendar section in which the information would not enter. I have sent emails and tickets to the supportline they give you. (Oh, and they don't list a phone number anywhere.) No one has returned anything back. It has been 2 weeks. You should not waste your money."
1,Not sturdy enough for job,"Cheap, and timely delivery, and not unattractive, but the chain links are too weak to hold normal fruit or vegetables in each of the three baskets simultaneously. Only get this item if you only need it to hold a few light items (e.g., 3 onions and a banana)"
4,"A Tisket, A Tasket, a 3-Tier Hanging Basket.","It's a chrome, basic, 3-tier hanging basket. I'm just excited to own such a thing. I can hang fruit from my ceiling. Given the state-of-the-art 3 Tier design, I can hold triple the fruit of those single tier hanging baskets."
3,Okay,It was okay when I got it the box was broken and when I tried using it on my karaoke player you could hear voices in the background but on my Xbox you couldn't which I thought was weird so I only use it on the Xbox.
3,"A touching story, honest and open",I had to pick a book to do a report on and I chose this book. I was captivated. The novel was a tad cnfusing to read since it was translated from french and written in first person present. But overall it was good.
3,Sinatra glossed over,"Interesting book, expecially the photos, but not very factual. Completely eliminates Sinatra's stormy relationships with his women, friends, etc. Apparently is family is in denial; omits any mention or credit of his relationship with Ava Gardener or last wife, Harpo Marx's X (Barbara). Didn't see any mention of how he mistreated his friends and business associates. Generally he was kinder to strangers than his employee's or friends: case in point, his porter of many years whom he fired with little justification, his stormy relationship with the Nevada gambling commission, his relationship with the mob. Never explains why he went from being a staunch democrat to a Rebublican. Frank originally dialiked Regan but later supported him, because of his hatred of Bobby Kennedy. his relationship with Spriro Agnew wasn't discussed, either. In all it read like a fairy tale"
1,false advertising,The item is not available! They sent me a cd. The item does not exist. How do expect a review? Where can I buy this item?
5,Great Book,"I thought this book was terrific. I am a 7th - 12th grade school librarian and have had many students who enjoyed this book. I was surprised by the low age level (9-12) on...info about the book. Although good readers of those ages will enjoy the book, there are many themes that are only going to be grasped by people with a little more life experience. We are using the book in a high school psych class as an example of a ""case study"" of a dyslexic child. I was very moved by the relationship between Buddy and her grandfather. The relationship between Buddy and her father, fraught with difficulties rang true and allowed for some real character development as they both had to ""grow up."""
2,Not cool,These rubber bands are so weak they break and become lose really fast Im somewhat disappointed wasn't happy with these.
5,Excellent,"Excellent guide! Richly illustrated, with all the necessary information for the peregrination for the way, with information of lodging, meal and other tips. I recommend."
2,Good information but too mystical,"The information about the albergues (hostels) can be helpful as well as the maps but they are not necessary. The maps can be downloaded from several websites and the ""best"" hostels end up to be whatever is available when you arrive in the next town.I spoke with some other Americans on the Camino who also bought this book and we all agreed that his commentary is way too mystical. It waivers between some Catholic references and something more New Age that ends up to have no real substance."
5,"Excellent product, price... not so much","I have been a big fan of GooGone for a long time. In my experience nothing removes glued on stickers better. And it does not damage the product, even if it a book - once it dries there is no stains.I also used GooGone to remove marks on painted walls and stains on the wood floor without damaging either one. The only thing to keep in mind when using GooGone is that it does not work instantly. You need to soak the area and leave it for about 5-10 minutes to penetrate. Then the sticker, goo, or dirt comes off easily. If it does not, just add a little more and give it a bit more time.I am down to just a small amount in the bottle I have been using and it is time to buy a new bottle. The Amazon price seemed a little high to me so I checked the Home Depot and an 8 oz bottle (same as this item) is $3.48.So I highly recommend the product, but the price is worth shopping around for.Ali Julia review"
5,Great stuff. Gets glue spots off sunglasses.,I needed something to get the fine hard glue spots on my sunglasses. It did the job. Has a pleasant small also.
5,STILL GOING STRONG,"I have been a fan of ALABAMA since 1981, when people said they are ""has beens"", I have always stood up and said they are ""still going strong"", there are alot of other bands out there, but, ALABAMA started it all. For The Record is a great compilation of their hits, I have their entire collection of releases and love them all, it would be hard to pick a favorite. Their new album, entitle ""20th Century"" is due out in May. I can't wait for that one either. ALABAMA RULES..."
3,So So,It was nice to hear the music again and it brought back great memries. I did not think the quality of the recording was as good as it could be. That was a little disappointing. But it's nice to have it back in my collection.
4,"Good filter, but I think they interfere with the taste of your coffee","I am blessed to find these in a local store for half of this cost of $2. But, in a pinch, I tried a regular fluted filter designed for today's modern coffee pots and found that the flavor was entirely richer and more robust than these fold in varieties. When you think about it, there's no extra paper to filter your coffee in the other filters - just punch a hole in the bottom of it, put it over the percolator stem and the water just perks the coffee, not tons of paper along with it. The coffee doesn't leak out of those other filters either, versus just using no filter at all.In addition, I've found that to achieve the same flavor, I have to use more coffee in these fold-over varieties. Try the regular filters if you can't find these fold-over filters, you'll enjoy the coffee much, much more!"
4,great resource,"A great resource, I used this book, combined with the fitzgerald CD review set and the workbook that comes with the CDs, and passed my AANP FNP exam on the first try! So many of the questions from the review material were present almost word-for-word on the exam, especially in the hemology, women's health and pediatric sections, I felt so well prepared! My only complaint with this book is that sometimes it gives TOO much info relating to particular areas, and sometimes too little, to the point where a few questions were confusing until I used other resources to answer my doubts!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Not sure why there are so many great reviews for this product. I think the company probably set up a dozen accounts to promote this terrible hot water bottle. I filled it up with hot water and the plastic left a residue on my hand! It's definitely not high quality at all even though it's advertised to be ""Made in Germany."" The shipping was also $10 which is pricey especially for how little this product weights. Avoid this product and keep looking for something that's made in USA."
2,review,Not enough of a warmth from this hot water bottle. If you like your HWB hot then this may not be for you. It is not for me but i am stuck with it. The ribbing on one side is i think partially to blame.
5,"Works as it should, arrived promptly with sweet little gift. Thanks.","I was attempting to replace an old genuine English rubber hot water bottle. This new German one is not rubber, but holds the heat well and is a good quality material for the purpose. Instructions in every language."
3,need some improvememnt,"the water bottle is good, but the handle of plug is too wide & thin, When I put it inside my comforter to sleep, my feet put on the bottle, as the handle was too big, the plug was turned easily, and water came all over my bed, it happened few times, and I finally trimed the handle smaller and now it is good to use."
4,Keren Ann in Wonderland,"""Nolita,"" Keren Ann's fourth full-length, is finally garnering the French artist the attention she deserves. That said, I like ""Lady & Bird,"" a collaboration with Iceland's Bardi Johansen (Gang Bang), almost as much. It has the soft and gentle vocals one would expect combined with some appealing weirdness, like a cross between ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Night of the Hunter, and Air's ""Virgin Suicides"" soundtrack--both musically and thematically. That said, I don't quite ""get"" the concept; something about two lost children named Lady (Keren Ann) and Bird (Bardi), but the tunes are great and the covers, the Velvet Underground's ""Stephanie Says"" and ""Suicide is Painless"" (the theme from ""M*A*S*H""), seal the deal."
3,Good material poorly presented,"There is a lot of good information in this book; but the writing style is unusual and difficult to follow even for an adult at times, so certainly for the children who are the target of this book."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This was the perfect DVD for relieving my back pain. The DVD focuses on General Back, and also breaks into specific back pain sessions: i.e., sciatic nerve pain. Very relaxing, and I have felt a major difference since completing the 33 minute session 3 times a week. (There are also 15 minute and 44 minute sessions for general back pain in case I have more or less time.) Overall, I am very satisfied."
5,The Great Poochini,"A delightful anthropomorphic 'tail' about a cultured mutt who has a night job as an opera star. Gary Clement's art as well as text is sublimely punny. I enjoyed it so much that I read it to my cat, Blackie, (age 12) who was all ears. Don't miss the opening night of THE GREAT POOCHINI."
3,Andre Scores Again,"We are very pleased. Pretty ladies in beautiful gowns, superb music and the typical, superb Andre fare."
3,New Years Eve in Vienna,"I wasn't all that impressed with it; i have many of the numbers elsewhere and i don't think there was any singing, which is a great loss.As well i do not think theyrdid new years eve itself that well. I was impressed that Manoa played the bag pipes; are these French bagpipes?Incidentally the first copy i got was no good from a quality point of view but Amazon replaced it straight away at no cost to myself. There attitude was great regarding this matter as well.RgdsIan J Brown"
1,disappointment,video quality is poor vcr level. Surround is unlistenable sounds nothing like the instruments are supposed to sound like. It is so bad it is offensive. Two channel is better but tone timbre of the instruments is still off to a lesser degree and unfixable. Stick with dublin and albert hall for a great surround experience
3,"OK for the price, but . . .","For the money, this light is OK, but the beam is poorly focused and uneven. I don't know if I would buy it again."
1,5 Months and it's gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cannot believe that you only get 5 months from this light and it's gone!!! I use it, maybe, once a week and never leave it in the charger but only charge it after it has been used. I had another one like this and it lasted for 3 years. What a rip off!!!!"
2,No Lasting Power,"Worked great for the first few months and approximately one year later couldn't get it to keep a charge. No way to change out any component, would not recommend to anyone."
1,TERRIBLE,This is a terrible product!!! I bought this and after waiting 2 weeks to get here it didnt work! so i called the company and its been 7 weeks and still not here!!!!
2,A shooting star,Like a shooting star these are super bright but only for a brief time. After only a short while the light dies and it takes a long time to charge them up. But if you need a quick spot light then go for it. I used them to play a field game of red light green light on a field during our first night at camp. They worked great but was very disappointed with their longevity.
4,Spotlight,"I didn't realize the size of the glass on this light was so big, I snorted when my husband opened it for Christmas. Totally a Tim-tool-time light, he loves it!"
4,This thing is BRIGHT!!,"Some time ago I walked out onto my back porch and heard something walking or crawling through the leaves, No moon and pitch blackness. I go out now armed with this monster of a flashlight just hoping whatever that was will come swishing through the leaves again. Do I like the light? You bet. Just wish it wasn't so heavy. Battery life at 20 - 30 minutes isn't so great, sufficent but not great."
3,SO-So,"My friend bought this jelly the other day and it was just kinda blah, no real flavor, just a bland concentrate taste. I prefer TA Homestead, it's organic, sustainably harvested, and is handmade."
3,Ok,"These are ok..kind of flimsy, but they serve their purpose. They do seem like they could fall over at any moment so I wouldn't store anything valuable in them!"
4,"Difficult to put together, but for a reason","These storage cubes are going to help me keep my children's playroom organized. The connector pieces were difficult to get on, but if they went on any easier, then the whole thing would probably come apart just as easy. Make sure you push the frames in all the way as you go or the alignment will be off for the next piece and you'll get frustrated wondering why you can't align all the sides. In the end, it's a great value and a perfect substitute for much more expensive playroom storage solutions. I also found some great Rubbermaid containers at Target to put in the cubes to hold smaller toys.I plan to buy another set of storage cubes from Amazon."
3,Seems okay,Have only used it for a few weeks at the lowest dose because really makes you go to the bathroom. Don't know yet if it is making a difference in joints. Purchase process through amazon was great though.
5,Nostalgia,"I was born in the 80's, and this was brought into class a few times. This is very good stuff, and is exactly how I remember it. It is however expensive. I ate the 10 pack within a day or two. I bought this to try out for long term food storage. They will last only a few years, which is expected because it's a dairy product.Definitely a comfort food, I will be stocking up more. LOVE IT"
2,product arrived broken,"My astronaut ice cream arrived in crumbs and not bars, I don't know if this is buyer specific but should be careful."
5,Love it!,"I love this stuff. I have a hard time not eating one right after the other! They're different, but I really enjoy them!!! :)"
1,Shattered Hopes,"I was really looking forward to giving the kids at my son's birthday party this ice cream. The packages arrived quickly, but I could tell the ice cream ""bars"" were in bits. I opened one package to take a look and the ice cream was in fact shattered into little pieces. And the inner packaging was sliced open in two places, possibly by a machine or razor. It just didn't look right and I didn't feel comfortable serving them to the kids.Now, this is probably not a problem with the seller, but perhaps they want to evaluate their vendor for these products. I just didn't want anyone else to have this same experience. Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy..."
4,Excellent Resource,"This book was very helpful. It has a lot of examples of cover letters and resumes. Also, it has comments from actual hiring managers and some contradict each other. That is helpful because it shows that not all HR departments feel the same way about resumes and the key is to appeal to as many as you can."
5,A Deep Spiritual Book and to Increase Faith in God.,"This book is very deep. I have found it to be an inspiration to live a better and more holy life. To love others increasingly.God shows his control of the world, yet, we believe we have control, we do to an extent. A profound book ready to get you on track with faith in HIM.Highly Recommended !"
4,How to determine the correct size?,"The price was appealing so I ordered two size 30 of this jammer. But when they arrived, the jammers could only fit my 6-year old boy (who is 65lbs). Nothing in the description suggests that this jammer is for kids. Maybe I am just not understanding the manufacture's size chart. It is not worthwhile to pay extra postage to get an exchange so I gave them to my kid."
3,I hate it.,"I did Tocqueville for an assignment, and I hate the guy. There are very few men who could have written so large a book without really saying anything at all. It made for terrible assignment writing, but somehow I got a distinction- perhaps because the lecturer had no idea what was going on either.I had no problems with this edition, which made life easier!The tagging function made life very easy."
5,Waay too short!,"An excellent series with very life like characters, and outstanding voice overs. I've gotten pretty far in the manga, and I was shocked and dissapointed at just how much the DVD leaves out in storyline, talked about ""abridged.""The manga has more the enough material for an 26eps. OVA if not more. =(Still an very good romantic comedy, and well worth buying."
4,THE BEST ATV GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is truly the best atv game ever!!!!!!!I got this for Christmas and play it every day. The best thing I like about this game is that the atvs are just like real atvs that you see every day. The only flaw though about this game is that the actual gameplay graphics are the exact same as atv offroad fury 1. But I do like how you can create your own enduro races with the waypoint creator. I truly recommend this game to any atv fan!!!!!
5,"Coming To DVD SOON, Plus a 2nd Series","This anime is incredibly funny and WILL BE COMING TO DVD SOON accord to the publisher. Also there is a ""Those Who Hunt Elves 2"" and it will also be released on DVD. Yes I mean they will be released here, as in the US. Speaking for myself I can't wait. If you want a series to pass the time try Martian Successor Nadesico. Its funny and have a decent plot with good character development."
4,Great CD,"I saw Shannon Open for Blue Rodeo, I thought he was pretty good, I had never heard of him before. I picked up the disk and I love it, it's folky, rock like and great listening music. If you like Blue Rodeo and such bands I am sure you will thouroughly enjoy Shannon Lyon's Summer Blonde"
5,REAL REGENCY,"An earl's black sheep son making his living as a highwayman, foils an attempted abduction of a beautiful damsel but is wounded in the process. Beautiful damsel nurses him back to health while the villain reappears and...Need I say more?Anyone familiar with Georgette Heyer will love this.Solely on my own, I've decided this is a precursor to THESE OLD SHADES, itself the precursor to DEVIL's CUB. Even though the names are different, the situations later recounted sound awfully familiar. Maybe Heyer changed publishers and didn't own the rights to her characters?Anyway, if you like regencies without sex, this is for you."
4,It's Not A Series!,"The Black Moth, though a wonderful book, is NOT (I repeat NOT) part of a series with any of Georgette Heyer's other books - certainly not with These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, and The Infamous Army. Devil's Cub is a sequel to These Old Shades, and An Infamous Army is a sequel to Regency Buck! The Black Moth is Georgette Heyer's first novel, and though it is not yet as mature as her later regencies, it is still good, lighthearted fun. Her characters are not greatly developed, and the plot is nothing special, but Heyer's charm and dawning style show through."
3,Not all Georgette Heyer,"I bought this on my Kindle thinking it was several Georgette Heyer books, it is not, it is one Georgette Heyer story and then a fairly random selection of other romantic stories. The other stories are a mixed bag, I read ""Just Enough Room"" quite effectively as a horror story at a Halloween party because of its portrayal of a man always knows best. Still 99 cents is not much to pay for one book so go for it."
1,what the hell is this supposed to be,this game is pathetic. it has horrible graphics a pointless story. the only thing that was even worthy of metion was the minigames which were quite awful. the gameplay is sorely lacking and the whole thing remained pointless all the way trough. this is a definite worst game of the year candidate. i cant beleive this junk is even out there. whatever you do unless you are 5 years old do not buy this game. get any other game. if you want a best buy gert rachet and clank or ssx 3.
5,THE BEST YET!,"Gregor and the Marks of Secret is the richest installment of the Underland Chronicles yet! Gregor returns to the Underland, but not for a prophecy. Instead, Gregor, his sister Boots and all the other characters help Luxa find out why the nibblers (mice) are vanishing. When you find out how they are, it will crush your heart. Some of my favorite parts were when Gregor and Luxa got close. I really wanted them to kiss! The ending makes me dread having to wait until 2007 for the fifth and final installment, Gregor and the Code of Claw. A big dissapointment was that Gregor and Luxa's realtionship didn't go further, and a sad part was that Thalia the tiny bat had to die and leave Hazard all by himself. I also didnt like how Luxa. Ripred, Howard. Aurora, and Nike left Gregor behind with the little kids."
5,Fabulous book series,Great read! I'm starting the 5th book now. I can't wait to see what happens to Gregor. Suzanne Collins rocks!
4,Good bok for a quick gun read,I thought this book was good. The plot was fun. Good for young kids 8-12. This book did a good job ending the series.
5,good for old folks too,"i have read the first three of the books in this series and have the last two on my desk. although the target reader is a pre-teen,at age sixty i found them entertaining and exciting. my daughter is a reading/special ed. teacher and i have given them to her for her classes. They have a little bit of gore and violence but not as much as you would see on the average tv station."
4,"Review by Lead role actor, Kit Cain","Whether or not you think much of the story line of this movie, we all had a lot of fun making it and my 8-year old daughter enjoyed being on the set with the animals so much that she made acting, producing and directing films her major interest in life. The total budget for the film was $[...] back in 1976. The $[...] I was paid was far from a SAG wage, but all things considered, it was a great experience. There was no money left for music so I wrote the song Away On Thunder Mountain and played the guitar, banjo, and drums myself ...managing to eek out a hundred bucks from the film budget for the small, multi-track sound studio. The music was as bad as the story line, but somehow the film made the rounds in the US, Canada, and overseas markets for about three years. It's a good kids' story nevertheless.[...]"
4,Stan Kenton meets Tom Jobim,"Anyone intrigued by the mix of Brazilian and big band motifs on Banda Mantiqueira's 1996 album, ""Aldeia,"" will be delighted by this outing, in which the swanky jazz elements are punched up and perfected. This is the kind of dynamic crosscultural mix that Stan Kenton and his peers were searching for in their mid-'50s explorations of Cuban and Latin-American melodies... pretty engaging and seldom overplayed, and less mellow than earlier Mantiqueira recordings. Nice lingering hints of the Dixieland-ish ""choro"" style of little-known Brazilian artists such as Sinho and Pixinguinga. Definitely worth checking out!"
3,"can't wait for ""finished"" version",Good beats on couple of songs and the message on track 1 (take control ) is important and clear. Good luck to Tariq & Velvet.
1,Poor workmanship,"I've had this for about a month, and I've used it less than 6 times.Even though I've carefully handwashed it, and merely wiped off the ice ring, the ice ring has sprung a leak (ewww, blue liquid on my celery!!).The lid is difficult to snap on/remove.The center container/lid is really too tall for its diameter, which makes using it for dipping rather awkward."
3,beggar su,"this is a highly polished and stylished prequel to Drunken Master and tells, essentially,the orgin story of Beggar So (or Su as we pronounce it). If this film dispensed with the wire-fu and othertom-foolery, we could distill it down to some great fight scenes....formulaic story of betrayal....exile....training sequences....revenge...personally i'd watch kid with the golden arm or 10 tigers over this....the old-school films have so much more charm."
3,Endless martial arts and stunts,"If you like martial arts movies with lots of action, including wrestling, this is a great movie to watch. It is a legend of the martial art warrior who is forced to abandon his peaceful life of a devoted husband and a father when his evil and vindictive stepbrother decides to destroy him. Michelle Yeoh and David Carradine make guest appearances in this film, but amazingly enough, they have roles that require not fighting. I liked their quiet presence on screen.In any case, movie goes over the top with fighting scenes. One almost wishes for good old times when Bruce Lee movies were in fashion. I liked wonderful costumes and gentle and graceful depiction of female characters. Great spectacle and entertainment. Do not expect more than that."
5,By far 2011's best movie,"Man from second one of the film it was terrific all the way to the end! I enjoyed it so much I am calling this movie 2011's top rated film so far! The fighting skills are incredible. The action is nonstop. I cried a couple times too because there is some real love in this movie! Oh man the special effects are incredible just like ""crouching tiger , hidden dragon."" My highest esteem to all who made this movie! Brilliant!"
1,THIS IS NOT DAVID BROWN'S BRAZZAVILLE,"This IS NOT by the band Brazzaville that you know. This is some Swedish group. I know several people who were confused into purchasing this album, much to their chagrin."
1,Been done before.,"Wow a book about dragons, that's new... oh wait, it's been done before. It has been done to death.I enjoy reading and watching movies and am tired of the snot and fart jokes. Sure that kind of humor can get a laugh, but it's forced and old when it comes to story telling.A new slant on this genre would be Dragons Versus Dinosaurs by G. L. Strytler, at least that is slightly better than this tired, haggard, worn out, messy, poor excuse of a..."
3,Watch out for bad editions,"The book is fantastic, great story fun illustrations and a great read-a-loud.However... There are some bad copies of it floating around where a group of pages are doubled up and a group of pages are missing. If you order this wonderful gem, be sure to check the pages around 121-152. Unfortunately this is at one of the very exciting parts of the story so best to find out before beginning reading.Fortunately the publisher is very friendly and helpful about replacing mis-produced books and you just have to contact their customer service to remedy the situation.So do enjoy this little treasure."
1,What&#65533;s so ethical in plagiarism?,The true meaning of this book is to show that people can get away with selling absolute garbage mixed with plagiarism. A few months after this book released there were mention from a couple of websites/bulletin boards that he plagiarized work from people like author W. Richard Stevens. (I see a lot of the reviewers here immediately recognized this.) So much for ethics.
1,Immature,"This book has far too many mistakes. For example, on page 44 (in the ""Advanced Windows Hacking"" section!) it says, ""Win.ini and system.ini constitute the Windows registry."" Umm, no, that'd be system.dat and user.dat. And in this ""Ethical Hacking"" book, why are there comments like (also on page 44), ""Say, you have a clueless newbie as your friend and want to give him a nasty scare, what do you do... This is actually a very lame trick but a good one to really scare newbies..."" This passage will also give you a good idea of the language and tone used throughout. For professional coverage of hacking, see the ""Hacking Exposed"" books."
2,Wasted effort...,"It was too hyped in media when it came. The book doesn't offer anything of substance and I don't understand how can one boldly go about plagarizing...anyway it has become obsolete by now.Might help newbies though.You are definitely better off spending money on Hacking Exposed by Stuart McClure, Joel Scambray, George Kurtz or Anti-Hacker Tool Kit by Keith J. Jones, Mike Shema, Bradley C. Johnson"
4,She can do much better than this....,I know she has a good voice and i know she is Jpop queen and i know she has many number one hits and also have CD's of her but let's keep it straight 16 or 15 tracks all with the same lyric get's boring over time. I'm not saying it's a bad album [so relax..ayufans!] One original and the rest of them are all remixed.But i have to admit i still recomend this album to everyone even if they don't like Jpop.
3,Twisted and Funny,"This movie has a nice blend of horror and humor, and you spend a lot time wondering if what goes on is really happening or rather just the overactive imagination of the boy in the movie. A quirky film with a dash of 50's flavor thrown in."
1,Instead buy the superior quality Widescreen Red Carpet Double Feature DVD (released in 2006) for 7 or so Bucks!,"Red Carpet Double Feature: Fear/ParentsDon't spend an arm and a leg on this out of print version of PARENTS! Instead, there's a better and cheaper version of this uniquely dark humored and mildly disturbing gem!!!Even though the DVD case erroneously states that the two films are presented in FULLSCREEN, the Red Carpet Double Feature release: ""FEAR""/""PARENTS"" (2006) actually sports gorgeous, anamorphic WIDESCREEN transfers of both films!!!! FEAR is an average film, but I've always loved the creepy, 1950s inspired PARENTS (I give it 5 Stars). The Red Carpet version starts (new!) at a measly $7.00 plus shipping for a total of ten bucks right here on AMAZON!From Ted Voron (voronOsphere)"
5,so good,"a brilliantly made movie...for those who love 50's culture, horror, suspense, or just a well done film."
1,Derivative. Dull.,Not a good movie. Nothing of interest here. Director Bob Balaban seems to want to get even with Mommy and Daddy. Fine. But did he have to rip off David Lynch to do it?
4,Pillow for the Knees,"Searching Amazon.com for a pillow, I came upon the Simmons Beautyrest Memory Foam pillow. It was just what I was looking for. When it arrived it was a bit larger than expected, however I gave it to my significant other as a gift. He used it the first night (wanted one for between his knees) and liked it very much. He also thought it a bit larger than he wanted but when I suggested cutting it in half he said he liked it the way it is. It keeps its shape, free cover is a nice extra, and it has an excellent warranty. The pillow is as claimed in their ad and shipping was prompt and free! I would definitely recommend this."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"This does not work as a video player with newer Ipod's including Ipod Nano! It only works for audio! Also, this company I think is out of business, cause I bought (4) of their products on Amazon, and am having issues with everyone one of them (power supply needs replace, rechargeable battery is dead....) and nobody returns phone calls or emails. If they are in business, it's worse customer service ever! DO NOT BUY SONIC IMPACT, YOU""LL REGRET IT!!!!!!!"
1,"Aspect ratio problem, it's true, it's true","I bought a refurb from another vendor for forty bucks. I'd read about the aspect-ration problems , and had taken heart in reports that the problem had been fixed. Perhaps it has, but not, alas, for my unit. The output's incorrect for 16:9 videos. Turn fullscreen (widescreen) on in your iPod, and it letterboxes the output, flattening the picture terribly. Turn fullscreen off, and the image fills the screen, but it's STILL squished vertically, and cut off at the side, too, I think.Do I want to rerip my videos to work with this idiotic machine? I doubt it. I'll either put up with it, send the unit back whence it came, or, most likely, toss it in the trash."
1,Sonic Impact Video 55,"So far this product is horrible. I ordered two and two have gone back for not working. There is sound but no video, one had a clipped wire. Just received the first replacement and guess what, it also doesn't work. I have now had two pay to ship two back, plus the third will go back. This item is not work anything and has cost me a great deal in return shipping along with two very disappointed 10 year olds."
3,A decent indie rock CD which won't appeal to everyone - indie rock fans might like it,"Meneguar's ""I Was Born At Night"" is a decent indie rock CD which I don't think will appeal to everyone. One of the reasons for this is that it has a sound that's punkish and also seems like it's trying to annoy you at times. The songs are usually pretty catchy and interesting, but I wouldn't call any of them great. They pretty much all rely on relatively interesting instrumentation and their catchiness. The singer isn't that good, but he's not terrible - he doesn't really enhance any of the songs. None of the songs are ""bad"", but they're mostly just decent. Except for the first two songs nothing really strikes you as really good. Indie rock fans might be intrigued by this, but I don't think I'd recommend it. For $14.00 you could buy way better (and longer) albums.Highlights include:""House Of Cats""""The Temp""""Christmas Isn't Christmas""""Wounded Knee""the rest are ""ok"""
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,found this to be an extremely boring movie plot does look something luke cabaret which was about 300% better pic
2,A Very Historical Overview of Interiors,"I found this book to be loaded with information. The author did an especially good job of incorporating the political, economic, and social context into the discussion of period styles. My main complaint about this book, however, was the complex writing style. It seemed to jump around a lot in attempt to include a basic overview of everything. This became VERY confusing at times. I feel it would be most helpful to someone who already has a solid background in the history of interior/furniture design periods. There was a lot of information about specific arts and crafts of each period (ie. metalwork, ceramics, woodwork)."
3,Not a bad book!,"At first glance this book did not seem very interesting. Once I finished this book and completely enjoyed it. I think that this has a great moral and we need to appreciate life more than we do. The story is about a 12 year old boy named Brandon and his coming to terms with his grandfather's death. He has not had a chance in his life to create a relationship with his grandfather, until he becomes sick and comes to stay with him and his family. Brandon is encouraged to get up each morning and ""Race the Sun"". He then is able to understand the appreciation of life, and learns to enjoy the moment. Brandon tries to encourage his father, who has become so self-absorbed, to get up and run with him. To no avail does he succeed. This book is a heart-warming novel and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy"
4,wonderful book!,"I had to read this book in the fifth grade. This book is very touching. At first I didn't think i'd like it but once i picked it up i couldn't put it down! It's basically about this navajo boy whose grandfather gets taken off the reservation and he has to share a room with him. well, he isn't too crazy about that.his grandfather is all about livinng the navajo ways, but the boy is just being a regular (american) kid. And the title? racing the sun, well i'll have to let you read the book yourself."
2,Racing the Sun,I think this book wasn't very good. The whole story is kindof slow and boring. The main characters are Brandon and Gramdpa. They are both Navajo. Everything else about them wasn't well described. The plots and story events are long and boring. It takes about 60 pgs to get to the first problem. For example: Brandon's parents are arguing about weather gramdpa should stay with them. The message in this book is never forget your lost ones. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes slow and long books.ByBrendan
5,Potawatomi Summer School 2000,"We read this book as part of our summer school curriculum. This is what some of the students had to say: I liked the book because it makes me think about my grandpa that died when I was 7. I am Indian. I liked it because Brandon did not like his grandpa at first, but then he got to know him and liked him. Josh S. - grade 4 I liked the book because Brandon is lucky to have a grandpa that teaches him the old ways. Shesh-ko N. - grade 7 I liked the book because Brandon is being taught all the traditional ways of Navajo. I would like to be taught all the traditional ways of Potawatomi. Ross S. - grade 6"
4,Not a lot of action but a good book,"12 year-old Brandon's grandpa comes to stay with them with a sickness. Brandon's parents say he's only staying a little while. One morning, Brandon's grandpa wakes him up before the sun comes up and brings him outside and tells him to run until the sun comes up and run back to him. Soon Brandon gets interested in the Navajo Indians and their traditions. Then Brandon finds out his grandpa wants to go back to Little Water. Can Brandon help his grandpa get back to Little Water?There was nothing really action and the problem was if Brandon could get his grandpa back to Little Water. They didn't really have the problem involved until the end of the book and in between they didn't talk a lot about it.I would recommend this book to people who dont' like a lot of action."
4,Smaller than advertised,"This pan is advertised as 12 inches, it even says so on the box, but is only 11-3/4. It is a nice looking pan, stainless steel with a hard base for even heating. I have no doubts about the quality of the nonstick on this pan, I researched nonstick coatings before deciding which pan to buy and Eclipse (also advertised as Innovex) which is what this pan has, is one of the best nonstick coatings around. It's just that I was purchasing a replacement for a worn out 12-inch pan, for which I have an expensive glass lid. It does not fit on this pan and all of my other lids are too small. The flat surface of this pan is small as well; only about 8-1/2 inches, where my old 12-inch pan has a flat surface of nearly 10-1/2 inches. Also beware that if the pan doesn't suit your needs, Ace Hardware Outlet has a restocking fee for returned items."
3,EXPO BOARD CLEANER,This product claims to be able to remove all marks from dry erase boards. However I have found it does not work on all boards. Does not do anything for the thin dry erase type board you stick to your fridge. Works great on the larger ones. Bottle is a decent size and it has no bad smell.
4,Head/neck pressure,"Great idea and a great item to own. The only complaint I have is that the reclining position puts some pressure on the head/neck area since there's no spacer bar at the end, as a typical hammock has."
3,Tippy but great!,"This chair is too easily tipped over. The hammock has stretched to about a foot from the floor but this does make it more stable, if harder for adults to get out of it. That being said, we love it! We placed it in a corner and put black pipe insulation on the top bars so when our 8 year old tips it - it does not dent the walls. It is not a swing but she is 8 and spends a lot of time in it."
1,Not compatible with any other remote,"I got a Trutech TV for the holidays. It was reasonably priced and seemed to be a bargain. This is really one of those ""you get what you pay for"" stories. When I got home and set it up, I discovered that no other remote can be used with this set. If you don't believe that Target would sell a product that is so limited, please Google. Customer service was no help....they weren't even sympathetic. Target was not approachable. The picture is great. The value is great. The product would be great if I didn't have to use one remote to turn the TV on and off and change the volume and another to use the cable."
1,A huge mistake,"I have recently bought two of these masks, one for me and the second for my wife. The main problem we have with them are the thick straps that cut through the ears. The mask is also so thick that it makes you so hot during the night, and you have no choice but to take it off. I will try to refund them and find something else here from Amazon."
4,Whose heads are these made for?!,You have to have a head the size of a tennis racket for the velcro to meet in the right place and create a light-tight seal. I end up using safety pins to fasten the straps. But they are very comfortable.
4,review of glow-in-the-dark galaxy,"The pins intended to secure the planets into the ceiling were somewhat flimsy, but once I got everything hanging properly there were no other problems. They glow really well in the dark and my six year old son enjoys them very much."
4,Mismatched piece,"All in all, well set up, except one planet would not fit together and customer service said I had to drive 110 miles to the nearest Toys R Us to exchange, Like THATS going to happen...."
3,Can't Enlarge the Store Fonts!?!,"I purchased this for my In-Laws who have been using a magnifiying glass to read their books. They love the reading experience, but the shopping experience is useless to them. It's very disappointing to all of us that I have to read to them from the Kindle Store because the fonts are so miniscule. Seems silly considering all the OTHER great things that the Kindle does. Now I'm fighting to keep it from becoming a ""newfangled device"" that they can't really use! PLEASE, Amazon: fix this feature!"
5,Skeptic to Believer,"I've been committed to reading ""real"" books for more years than I care to admit. So, although I was intrigued by the new technology, I hesitated getting a reader but finally broke down. The reading experience is slightly different, of course, but at the end of the day it is still a reading experience and the convenience factor is unbeatable. My wife, who is also a reader, is slowly coming around, particularly as she is now reading a 550 page book which weighs her down on her travels. Right now, I've got six books stored on my Kindle and if I am somehow stranded on the proverbial desert island I should be in good shape for a while."
4,Kindle-2 and not my last,"For the Kindle 3 I have only a few suggestions:File folders or some other way of organizing the material. Perhaps a ""recently read"" tab, not just recently added suggestion.And the store needs to get better. Thomas Pynchon, Cormac McCarthy, John Updike, Saul Bellow, lots of Philip Roth: missing. These are not nobodys...they are the bigwigs of modern fiction. There are also many others that are missing that I can't think of right away and many that have incomplete collections.Think of who will buy this product: real readers who crave real authors. Make more avaialble and really pressure their publishers to get into the 21st century.That's it, the rest will come with the technological advancements but these are possible to fix immediately."
5,I LOVE MY KINDLE!,"I really bought my Kindle for travel, as I have extensive trips coming up which would require several books to cover my needs. There is no way I am carrying several books while traveling, and I don't like to buy and discard as I go either, so the Kindle is the perfect solution. However, I found I also love it for home use--easy to carry to appointments requiring waiting room time, and wonderful for reading in bed! It is my intent as they come available to convert books I own and have enjoyed into my Kindle format to free up book storage space at home--the books themselves can then be donated to my local library and I have less clutter but still have instant access to old favorites. So, however you look at it, it is a great way to have plenty of reading material in a very convenient size. I love my Kindle!"
3,Wake up Amazon!,"I have a Kindle 1, and love it. I have had the chance to handle the Kindle 2 and the DX, and there are certainly noteworthy improvements . . . BUT . . . there is STILL no provision for folders -- everything on your Kindle (whether stored on the internal memory or on a memory card) appears as one long multi-page list with no way of separating or categorizing books you have read, reference books, collections by topic or author, whatever. This is really silly, and now that there is serious competition I find it incredible that Amazon has not responded to this need. Trying to move into ""professional space"" with the DX without this capability is just bizarre!"
3,Great but could be better.,I really love the Kindle 2. The ease of use is great and the downloads are usually very quick. Turning the pages can sometimes be slow and the voice on the text- to- speech really is awful. The prices could be lower but even at $ 9.99 I'm still buying them. I have downloaded several very good books for free and $ 3.69 and up. Color for the pictures and a backlight feature would definitely be a plus. It goes with me everywhere and I believe I'm reading more as it's much lighter than a book to carry. Also the customer service has been excellent. I have no major complaints and lots of compliments.
1,"If I buy it, I damn well own it, but not with Amazon's ""Kindle""","If I buy a book, then the book is mine to keep, no matter what trouble the bookseller later finds himself in. Amazon's policy of stealing books back from Kindle owners, without permission, is vile, unethical, and immoral. Amazon's demonstrated willingness to implement this vile, unethical, and immoral policy renders the Kindle worse than useless. As long as Amazon's Kindle has the ability to allow Amazon to uninstall owner's property without permission, the Kindle will remain crap for suckers."
2,I am disappointed,"I was excited to see kindle 2 in my hands, I have kindle 1 as well, all shortcomings of kindle 1 were addressed and fixed, its a gorgeous device but i was disappointed to see the contrast on the text was not as good as kindle 1, my wife agrees and I have shown it to couple other people and they all agreed, it may not matter to those who don't have kindle 1 due to lack of comparision with kindle 1."
1,Deception,"Bon produit, mais malheureusement retourné dans son carton et non utilisé car:- Aucun livre en franais...- Absolument non adapté à la lecture de PDF scientifique, écran beaucoup trop petit.Bref un problème de contenu...De là à passer au 9"" pour pouvoir lire mes articles médicaux, je préfère attendre de voir comment se positionnera la concurrence."
4,Love My Kindle/Hate New Publication Delay,"I have had my Kindle for almost a year and adore it. I use it daily and feel like it ""disappears"" in my hand. I don't even notice it any more, it is so much like a book. I read it nightly and it is much easier to fall asleep with! I love all the features but my favorite thing about it is that I can get any book within minutes, which brings me to the problem. I tried to purchase ""Game Change"" and found that it won't be released on Kindle for several months. This is unfair and seems to me like a blatant marketing ploy. I feel taken advantage of. Amazon should fight the publishers on this issue and protect the rights of loyal customers who have invested $300 for the privilege of reading ""paperlessly."""
3,Too expensive for what you get.,"Still $259.00? C'mon. I recently gave in and bought a Kindle, figured it would be great, read the reviews. It was nice, a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but still a decent product. But, in this age of ipad's that do what the Kindle does, and tons more, the Kindle simply must come way down in price. I ended up returning my Kindle. Now, I'm not going to run out and buy an ipad. In fact, if the Kindle were to drop to $99.00, i'd probably buy one again. But I simply don't read enough to justify it currently. And like a lot of people here have claimed, having a Kindle did not make me all of a sudden start reading 5 books a week. Just my two cents. I respect the product, but it costs too much for just an e-reader."
4,kindle review,"This is a marvelous and remarkable product for those who love reading. After using the kindle for several weeks, I have suggestions to make the kindle a more user-friendly device.-should be a way to erase one item at a time from the ""my clippings"" file-chapters of books should have the kindle location numbers next to each chapter-the kinle user's guide leaves much to be desired and needs re-writing to clarify features and how to use them-a book footnote should appear immediately after the text it is explaining, not at the end of a chapter-the protective cover should have pockets on the inside front and inside back covers in the event the reader wants to make notes regarding passages readDavid Coyle"
4,Kendle 2 review,"The good things are: Easy to learn and use. I love the ability to change the text size as my eyes don't work the way they used to. Really easy to download new books. The availability of periodicals is impressive and useful. It's the right size.The negative: I think it should come with some type of protective cover. I feel that it needs one, and it should be included for the $300."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"I have a neurological disorder and, so, don't have the best dexterity in my hands. I was a little worried about being able to use the Kindle easily, but it is perfectly designed for ease of use. The page turn buttons are so much easier than physically turning the pages of a book. The 5 way joy-stick button is also very easy to use. I absolutely love my Kindle 2! I'm reading more now than I used to, it is just so much more fun!"
1,e-book prices scheduled to rise 30-50%,"I was seriously considering purchasing a Kindle as a present for my wife, but just read an article from the New York Times that the cost of e-books are scheduled to rise from the current $9.99 to $12.99 - $14.99 under new deals that publishers negotiated with Apple and Amazon. I'm now going to wait to see if this changes, otherwise it's a deal breaker."
3,"Good device, needs improvement","I bought a Kindle, excited about the idea of having books with me at all times, along with the possibility of having newspapers and magazines downloaded automatically. Here is what I found:Pros: Practically instant on. Text very easy to read with no flicker at all. Automatic download of my newspaper happened every morning automatically. Well designed interface, easy to navigate. The Kindle remembers where I was in the book and gets me back there when I open the book. Thin and elegant and is a good size.Cons: Newspaper and magazines are only partial, with practically no images or graphics. If I buy the New York Times or Time Magazine, I want the whole thing. Battery life is very poor even when the Kindle has wireless turned off. I would have expected that when it's off it practically uses no battery. But just sitting in my computer case for a few days, and the battery is drained.Result: I returned it. Thank you Amazon for your amazing customer service."
1,new one around the corner,"I bought the first Kindle and than a few months later the Kindle dx came out. It never fails that as soon as I buy one item, a new one will appear. So I would like to sell my old kindle."
3,kindle 2,The following is comment on the kindle 2.No touch screen support.The 5 way controller is not flexible enough and hard to place the cursor to any word.No wifi support outside US.No other languages support.No other language dictionary.There is no advertisment saying that Kindle DX will come to the market when I purchased Kindle 2!The mp3 player cannot show playlist.
3,Kindle 2,"All in all a good product, but after being spoiled by an iPhone I really miss the fact that there is no backlight. I also find myself trying to use a touch screen, (which doesn't exist)."
1,Great Disappointment,"I was planning on purchasing the Kindle2 1-March-2009, but on reading the news that morning I found that Amazon had let many of its customers down. It advertised text to speech capability for this product; to me the most attractive feature considering its screen only displays gray-scale (no color). Unfortunately Amazon did not stand-up for its consumers and gave in to publisher's demands by making the text to speech feature optional at the discretion of the publisher. It's as ridiculous calling text to speech a derivative product as saying you can't read a book out loud to someone because it's a copyright violation. This decision lacks foresight, responsibility, and that most important value, trustworthiness. I guess I just have to stick to adobe which is happy to provide text to speech on a plain hand-held computer."
1,Different Birthday Present For My Daughter,"Wow - Just about to pull the trigger on this item for a birthday present for my daughter. Not now - Orwellian, indeed !"
4,Love my Kindle,"I love my Kindle 2 and the red leather case. I've had it about a month now and am totally satisfied. It is so user friendly, I usually think I'm holding a book. There was so little learning curve. If someone recommends a book, I can order it right on the spot, no waiting.I hope that Amazon keeps the prices of these books down as I previously had bought used on Amazon. This is more convenient and no postage. However, books were generally $9.99 or less and now they are starting to be a bit more. That would defeat part of the charm of Kindle."
2,It helps little to read document,"It is hard to understand how this famous e-reader does not provide with the option to read pdf documents at different sizes by using a zoom, as other e-readers do.Many of the documents I need to read in an e-reader are pdf documents, so I must read with tiny size of lettering when I use the Kindle device."
5,"Worth it, love it, better than cutting down trees to read the news","The only downside is that I understand that I cannot read ebooks outside of Amazon or its affiliates. Not that I'm going to need more than they offer, except for local news content."
1,Backdoor deleting? Not for me...,"I think Deleting content from your kindle without the user knowledge or even acknowledgement is totally out of line!Sorry Amazon, but unless you revamp your software and remove this remote ability, the thought of buying one will never even cross our mind here.As somebody said earlier, if a Barnes & Noble employee try to enter my house to repossess books I have bought from them, I have a legal (and forceful way) to lock my door and repel them.I thought you knew better. I'll keep using your services a lot, but kindle is definitely out!"
1,No kindle,"I was very close to purchasing the new kindle. However, Amazon made may decision very easy. I will never purchase a product where the information is not mine. Amazon made a fatal mistake. I am not sure I will ever do business with them again."
