4,good idea,this works good and dries fast. this is a good value for the price and you only use a little bit at a time.
4,"Messy, but it works!","My roommate got me a 1000-piece Harry Potter puzzle for my birthday this year. It took us a few days of strained eyes and painful headaches to finish, but another month for me to finally stop procrastinating on buying some glue to stick it all together.I applied this glue twice on each side of my puzzle, and it's definitely durable -- I'm not really scared of my puzzle breaking. It was a bit difficult to apply, though, and took a while, because I'd apply it to the whole side and leave it for a few hours before realizing that part of it was still untouched by glue.. due to both my poor observation skills and the terrible applicator. The glue is extremely sticky, but it ended up being pretty fun to peel off my fingers, ha!The bottom line is, it's messy, and you probably won't want to use it for more than one puzzle (or two max), but it works, and it's relatively inexpensive. I'll probably purchase this again if I decide to finish another puzzle!"
1,POOR filmmaking for most important subject,"I checked out this film because of it's ranking of political films here, which I always buy from Amazon. The topic is SO important, our water crisis and who owns our water, but what an amateur film! The cover is 1,000 times more professional than any of the filmmaking. But what made me more upset is when I saw Blue Gold World Water Wars which is also among the top political films on Amazon. Blue Gold is an incredible film! Incredible! Buy it and save yourself the time on FLOW. Holding the two films side by side is like Picasso compared to my three year old daughter's scribbles. I hate to be so harsh, but I paid money for this DVD and it is just so poorly made, and with such a similar and powerful film as Blue Gold out there, one must wonder how this film has achieved so much attention? Buy Blue Gold!"
4,all you need to know about the worlds-wide shortage of water,This is a beautiful presentation of the privitization of water with sounds and sights of our unique and irreplacable commodity throughout the film. The dangers facing the third world are enormous as corporations try to steal our precious resource and make it very much a for-profit entity. From the global to local issues Salina covers it all and gives us a beginning road map in understanding the difficulties of curbing predatory ownership bymultinational corporations like Nestle.A stunning overview!
1,"Written for math experts, not students just starting out",This book is terrible. It is not written for the average student to understand. They skip over concepts and descriptions and when taking an online course these steps are absolutely crucial because much is lost in the learning process through an online course. When your book is practically your teacher don't use this one. It sucks.
4,"personalized, insightful look into secret spec. operations","Easy, good reading. personalized account of a very dangerous tour of duty from a veteran Spec. Ops officer. Good account of how this soldier handled his personal war. Wide range of emotional situations handled with integrity, truth and honor."
2,Review of A Warrior's Tour,"I expected a lot more from this book. The events occurred almost 30 years ago, and the book was written as if they occurred last year. The book is totally dependant on Mr. Nicholson's memory. He had an opportunity to give the reader some real insights into the operation of SOG from conception of an action to its execution. ""15 Months in SOG - A Warrior's Tour"" reads more like a war novel, and it leaves the reader feeling that something is missing."
4,"No Quake 3, but...","First person shooters are few and far between on dreamcast right now, so when i saw this game, i figured i'd give it a go. While it is no Quake 3, it is not a bad game either. Gameplay is straightforward, using the analog pad to move and the action buttons to jump, slash, and lock-on. The lock-on system is very intuitive, helping one on one combat with an enemy greatly. The graphics are some of the best on the system, although sound is not up to par with what the dreamcast can do. Voice acting also leaves something to be desired. Overall, while not a superior game, it will give you quite a few hours of hack-n-slash fun, if not a laugh or two at the voice work."
4,Super Cute!,"I loved this book!! It was laugh-out-loud funny, and such a cute tale. I really liked the main character, even though she seemed to miss the obvious. It was the perfect escape from reality book, and would make a perfect story for the beach."
1,Didn't really take to this RPGS,"I generally like Japanese RPG's games, but this one was a bit flat.I only played it for about 5 hours and was bored, so Sold it"
5,Great Product,We have used this products for years and it is the BESTIt does the job like no other product we have used
2,Just barely worth the effort. . .,"At first, I really wanted to give Volume 6 of the ""Have a Nice Day"" series three stars but, the more I looked at it, the more it just didn't measure up. Three good songs out of twelve chances just isn't three-star performance.The three good songs are very good: ""Sweet City Woman"", ""Signs"" and the powerful, disturbing ""Timothy"" give this disc some punch. The Pipkins' ""Gimme Dat Ding"" and Bobby Russell's ""Saturday Morning Confusion"" are pleasant supporting cuts, but the disc comes to a screeching halt right there.No disc entitled ""Super Hits"" should have seven non-entities on it, especially when there are only twelve tracks present. Sorry, Rhino, but you really dropped the ball on this one."
3,Have A Nice Day: Volume Six,"To me this Volume Six of the h.a.n.d. series is unique and the reason is because I did not recognize the names of many of these songs but the few I did recognize; I have fond memories of so I decided to buy it and now that I own it I can say that I remember all but two of them. Most of the reviews you read are opinionated (including mine) and this Volume has plenty of negative reviews but I don't believe it is that bad. Lighthouse's, One Fine Morning, Stampeder's, Sweet City Woman, Crabby Appleton's, Go Back, Five Man Electrical Band's, Signs, &, Absolutely Right, and Gayle McCormick's, It's A Cryin' Shame, make this a decent Volume. As a long time music fan; I have found that on occasion; Top Ten songs do not appeal to me as much as songs that didn't make the Top Fourty and that is the case on this Volume. Another thing I have found out is that these twenty five, Have A Nice Day, Volumes are liked and disliked. It all depends on the individual and to me this one is ok."
2,"Fair, But Too Much Filler","Some of these ""hits"" do not belong on a CD bearing this title: ""He's Gonna Step On You Again"" by John Kongos, ""It's a Cryin' Shame"" by Gayle McCormick, and ""Tarkio Road"" by Brewer & Shipley missed the top 40 completely, while other oddities like ""Absolutely Right"" by the Five Man Electrical Band and ""One Fine Morning"" by Lighthouse have received little or no airplay since they were originally released. Rhino Records usually delivers good results with their CD collections, but they have made an exception with this one."
4,Long live 'Logom'!,I picked this book up when I started dating a Swede and was pleasently surprised (both by the book and the girl!). Since Swedes generally speak very good english it's often easy to forget that they do have differnt traditions and culture. The book is a great introduction to some of those differences and leads to a lot of fun conversations.I skipped the chapter on business dealings but the rest of the book was well worth the price.
3,Not All Doo Wop,"It's a mixture of Doo Wop, Rhythm & Blues, and Rock-n-Roll. Doo Wop is a special sound often confused with other popular music of the 1950s and 1960s, and that's the case with this CD set."
3,A little better,"It's ok...not that much of a difference noticed in the case of engine noise. Pretty expensive considering it ultimately is just another full synthetic. All in all, I'll probably buy it again."
2,Not worth the money.,"If you don't know anything about oil then its very easy to associate expensive oil with being much better.When i first got my gsxr 600 2006, i tried a few of the expensive oils since money wasn't really an issue with my new toy.Theres no performance increase with royal purple motorcycle oil. you wont get more miles to the gallon. itwont make your engine quieter.I now use cheaper regular full synthetic motorcycle oil that costs half the price and i can't tellthe difference between that and when i had royal purple in there.Royal purple is too expensive and not worth it. Its more expensive because they spend moreon advertising and color it purple i guess.If you really want to spend more and the best for your engine then just change the engine oil more often."
2,"Great product, until it dies","Bought this for my motorcycle along with the pen version. They work great, and give (seemingly) accurate readings. The head angle makes it easy to get around the brake rotors on my SV-650.Unfortunately, the pen gauge died about 2 years after I got it, and the regular one died after 5 years: it would just show ""L"" on the LCD. I cracked it open and discovered the ""lifetime"" battery had died. I had to cut some plastic to change it out, but even with a new battery it would then only read ""1.0"" so perhaps it needs to be calibrated or something.I rate this 2 stars because they advertise it as having a ""lifetime"" battery when the battery obviously dies after a few years of infrequent use. It is also impossible to change the battery so you have to throw the whole unit away to buy a new one."
3,MLB for life,I was impressed with this game the first few times I played it. I had a lot of fun w/ the SCOTT MURRAY code. Enter SCOTT MURRAY as the name of your created character and he will hit 606' home runs every time at bat! It is awesome!
5,Best Baseball Game With The Current Available Technology!,"MLB 2001 is one the best new games of the season. No work needed here. If you want a game with all the gusto and less hype buy a baseball game from 989Sports. Preferably MLB 2001. It has great improvements. ""Same dance, just a different tune."" The buttons work the same to control the movements of players, which is one of the greatest plus's. The players stance, movement, and catch ability is greatly improved. Die Hard baseball fans have it all wrong about this one. It's the best game currently for the playstation. Believe me, I have played them. All I can say is,give it a try. Disappointment is for the mental-case baseball fan whom believes everything is currently perfect in baseball stats to predict a baseball game's outcome. How many times has a baseball fan been proved wrong in a real game about this one? Forget the twisted views and purchase MLB 2001 from 989sports. Let the baseball fan of the opposing team take all heat. PLAY ON!"
3,kind of,i like the game but on some parts it takes to long but i like when i score a home run cuse in my mind it feels exsitment
4,"Spider Didn,t Stumble","I have just finished reading the ""Spider Stumbled"" by Frank Paul Venis, a new author. I was more than pleased by his unfettered story telling ability of a very realistic experience of life in a once middle to upper income Queens NY neighborhood. The detailed account of a young teenager from a good family, but nevertheless inexplicably involved in murder,sexual promiscuity, racial bias and a host of other threats to normal progression to adult life by many of our teenagers regardless of their surroundings. It gives the reader pause to consider the question is their anything society can do to remedy these conditions which threaten so many of our young people. The book can be considered alarming, or, a warning. Nonetheless I enjoyed it. Good reading ,fast paced, fine first effort."
1,frank sucks,"i met him and he is very rude, didnt even have to read the book, i could tell by the summary that it was boring."
1,Kindle Edition: Riddled With Errors,"I read this book years ago and enjoyed it immensely. Call it satire, call it alternative history; whatever you call it, it's amazing. If I were reviewing the actual printed version of this novel, I'd give it four or possibly even five stars.But I give the Kindle Edition one star because it is absolutely RIDDLED with errors. I can live with a few mistakes, but this goes just too far. There is a character named ""Waffing."" Literally half the time he is called ""Waning."" ""Feric,"" the book's protagonist, is often ""Peric."" Exclamation points are replaced with the number one. It's clear that no care, attention to detail, or effort was put forth in preparing the electronic version. If they were charging a buck for it, fine. But this is $8.00, a real book price. For that I expect a real book.This edition is just disgraceful. It shows no respect for the book, the author, or the readers."
2,Great Cd,"This is an awesome and BIG collection of songs. They are all very new, some are still playing on the radio. There's pop, R&B, rock and alternative. I reccomend it."
1,I don't do titles,"This game is so bad, it hurts. All you do is pop puyos, (whatever those are), it has bad single player but good multiplayer. Don't buy it, it is not good."
2,Not built to last,"We purchased this unit last year (07) and we really enjoyed it. But after quite a few DVD read errors and numerous DVD cleanings (the cleaning of already clean discs), the DVD player stopped recognizing discs all together! And just after the warrantee expired! This system is nice but not built to last. This appears to be a common problem with this unit if you read all the reviews."
2,Won't recognize DVD's,"I bought this system a little over a year ago. After about 8 months, it won't recognize a DVD at all. The first time it did it, my wife and I didn't think anything about it. We went back to watching regular TV. Now 4 months later, we are still having the same problem and because the year warranty is up, Technical Support will not offer any advice. There only solution is for us to buy a refurbished system. From reading on-line, other buyers are having the same problem. If you want to listen to CD's and have a decent audio system, this is for you but I wouldn't spend the extra money since your not actually getting a DVD player."
2,Another one bites the dust.,"I bought this refurb unit about 2 years ago and used it very lightly. I hadn't used it for a year and then this Thanksgiving we decided to throw in a dvd and watch it. The dvd player still plays disc but I get no sound at all through the speakers, none. I have a HDMI hookup to the flat screen TV and audio cords from the TV to the player for TV. Firmware is upgraded. I assume the amplifier has died for some reason, probably from not being use very much. Who knows? So anyhow I'm left with 3 good speakers with no way to drive them.How did I miss all of the reviews that said the player crapped out after light use?This pretty much tells me to stay away from Philips products.Oh yea, the unit did sound good for a 2.1 system but..."
1,Do Not Buy,"Worst piece of consumer electronics I ever owned. YOU CANNOT ADJUST THE VOLUME OF THE SUBWOOFER. Any one who has ever owned a home theater system knows the volume of the sub needs to be adjusted to the source or program. Otherwise you have almost no bass or complete distortion. You could easliy adjust the sub volume 10 times an evening to get the right sourround sound effect without your neighbors banging on the wall !Also, it gets stuck and you have to unplug and replug to restart it. The delay in executing commands is so bad you will think it is not responding. Just adjusting the volume takes forever as you push the up (or dowm) button, then wait, then push it again and so on.Almost any other system on the market will be better !"
2,The DVD has broken three times...don't bother,"The speakers are fine...not great, just fine. The DVD player has broken three times! I have sent it back twice...I don't even use it anymore. I would say...don't bother."
2,Poor DVD Loader,Wasn't long after owning this system before the loader failed. Wouldn't read DVDs and wouldn't eject them. This is my first experience using slot type loaders. The only recourse I had was tipping it upside down and shaking it while hitting the eject button. I will send this back under warranty but I'm disappointed that I got a bad unit. Price per feature was very attractive but if you have to return it under warranty it negates any good feelings on the product.
3,good set,"Fast shipping, reasonable price, some dvd need lots of cleaning before working but seller was more than happy to offer an exchange."
1,Disappointing,"This game just rocks. It is so much fun and so detailed that you would probably think that the guide is too. You would be wrong. This guide lacks almost any real useful information and is confusing. While it is clever to do it in a comic book fashion, the important info is either hard to find or non existant. Many times, info that I needed to know was not included and the clue bottle map is non demetional and hard to determine where the bottles are. I have actually had to get that info else where. In fact, if you need assisntance with the game, I STRONGLY suggest you travel over to gamefaqs.com and look it up there. Much better advice and its free. Don't waste ur money with this guide, I am sorry I wasted mine."
4,Made me laugh 'til it hurt.,"I'm not usually one to watch comedy more than once--once you've heard the joke it's not as funny. I have watched this 3-4 times with different friends and still start laughing out loud each time. There are parts--where there is more physical humor that aren't quite as funny to me, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. My parents in their 60s laughed and thought it was funny, but probably won't watch it again because they weren't into the physical humor as much. My kids (3,6,8) were able to get many of the jokes and 3 years later still sing some of the jingles. It was good family fun and fully worth the money."
3,Small & Lightweight,"I bought this for my wife to use when she travels. She doesn't use it much, which I take to mean that she isn't that satisfied with it, but she said it does work."
4,"""Cali Lewis"" likes it","I haven't actually tried or seen this product, I'm just posting a note for those interested that Cali Lewis of ""Geek Brief""/""Dear Cali"" said on her show that it was her favorite screen cleaning product for her Macs, TVs, etc. I might buy a bottle and come back here after trying it... my Mac screen is disgusting right now."
4,Be careful which version you buy!,"Amazon has many versions of Sunrise, I was looking at the imported Korean version because it came up with my search for it in Blu-ray. It even had reviews that referred to a Blu-ray version.But upon a more thorough investigation, I found out that the imported Korean version is only the regular DVD Version - not the Blu-ray. If I had purchased it, I would have been very, very displeased.This is something that Amazon has been doing a lot of lately - mismatching reviews - one has to be careful.my two cents."
4,Great for beginner/intermediate speakers,"This is the dictionary I drag around with me whenever I am out and about in Japan. Not exactly pocket size, but not large enough to make it annoying to carry around. This has saved me on countless occasions when I'm trying to have a conversation with someone at the bar/restaurant."
3,...Ehh...,"....I took all 25 cd's and burned them to 13 discs for the car..Not as interesting as my Rolling Stone Magazine 500 greatest hits but its a nice diversion from the lousy music of today.! Of course we all have satellite radio nowadays but most of us like to do it our own way..Oh,@ Rykre you still as boring 3 years later.?"
1,never go it,"I ordered this CD way back in October to get a few hard to find songs like Venus. I waited and waited while other CDs I ordered came, but no Have A Nice Day. Please check to see what hppened. I still want it.PapaJoe"
4,Buy it for The Spiral Staircase & Shocking Blue,"As always with these compilations, there is dreck one has to wade through, but where else can you find Shocking Blue's kick-butt ""Venus"" and the Spiral Staircase's ""More Today Than Yesterday"" on the same disc, WITH Steam's classic high school chant ""Na Na Na Na Hey Hey Hey""?! ""More Today.."" is one of those exquisitely crafted, joyous pop classics one wants to play over and over until the mood sticks. What happened to these one-hit wonders? The brass and percussion arrangement is choice, too. ""Venus"" was defiled in the 80s by Bananarama, but the Danish group here is almost proto-punk. I'm certain this song came out in the sixties, but perhaps it had a second life in the 70s. In any event, ""Venus"" is classic rock'n'roll, pure pop for now people as Nick Lowe sang."
3,Better 'on paper' than it is in your ears,"Entry #3 in Rhino's 70s pop series is a strong contender in chart terms with #1 song ""I Think I Love You"" from the Partridge Family and 6 Top 10 tunes squeezed in.Unfortunately, some of them don't hold up all that well. Alive and Kicking's Tommy James produced ""Tighter, Tighter"" is limp..the sort of song you'll listen to after you've punched ALL the radio buttons first but nothing you'd ever turn up. Likewise mid-tempo ""Gypsy Woman"" from Bryan Hyland.In fact, some of the best tunes here didn't score all that well in the Top 40. Mungo Jerry only cracked the Top 40 once but ""In the Summertime"" became a warm weather classic, revived every time the mercury climbs. The faux reggae ""Montego Bay"" ensured Bobby Bloom a spot on oldies radio with its lilting drums and buoyant whistling. And Sugarloaf's ""Green Eyed Lady"" still sizzles out of speakers.BOTTOM LINE:It'll do but this isn't one of the first discs from the series I'd pick up if cash is limited."
3,Some hard to find gems are here.,"R. Dean Taylor, Alive and Kicking, Mungo Jerry, Bobby Bloom, and Jerry Reed make this disc a must. The disc also has it's bad points and they ring loud and clear: the Partridge Family and Bobby Sherman. There is also the average with Melanie and Hotlegs. As you go through this series, you will find that many of the disc are like this one, very uneven with a few gems that you will have a hard time finding anywhere else."
5,It is a very nice cream. It feels smooth and non greasy. i like it a lot!,"It is not like one of the reviewer said it smells bad. It is very fresh, have no problem with it."
5,A masterpiece!,Buy this book! It is the most sensual of works; a hundred tiny bites of something exquisitely delicious. This is a quality book and a great intro to haiku. If you love this book then rush out and buy Masajo Suzuki's Love poems.
4,great product to keep things tidy,"Pros: works perfect with a standard 3x5 index cardcan handle some resticking if you need to move it (not more than once or twice)does not leave a gooey residue if you remove itCons: difficult to open the ""pocket"" without having long nails or similarOverall a great product for keeping lists of where things go for autistic kids who need a bit of help. Also great for keeping your freezer inventory handy (a must with a family of 7 on a budget)! The only reason to rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I find it difficult to get the pockets open unless you use long nails (mine are very short) or the card you are writing on to open it. Once you have the card in the pocket you can't remove it unless you have the same to open it. Petty perhaps but that irks me a smidge."
5,A great idea.,"The concept of selling parts of the bridge along with the action figures is a nice touch. Once you collect all of the figures, you have a replica of the Enterprise bridge to showcase them on. As usual, Art Asylum has made the most of their all access pass to ""Enterprise."" The sculpt of Lt. Reed is an excellent likeness and the console is well done indeed."
1,Shocked and Angered,"I bought this CD thinking it was typical punk rock CD but i was rudely mistaken. This band is very very unique in the sense that it DOES NOT fit into the punk genre. The band does have a good sound on a few of its songs but it is lyrically appalling. It lyrically lashes out on the punk ideas of our nation and just being punk in general. They tell punks if you don't love this nation then leave, well, i say to ROITGUN if you don't love our punk scene then get out! The band itself is contradicting and somewhat confused. On their website they promote chaos and speak of being ""hooligans"" but on their CD they talk about being proud of our nation. This CD/band angered and shocked me. Good thing i bought this CD used for only a dollar. This CD will be publically defiled and disposed of a.s.a.p. BOYCOTT RIOTGUN!!!"
5,Great fun!,An excellent series of stories. Himes writes about a subculture of crime and other pathologies without trying to score political points one way or the other. He's just telling a rousing tale. I'm eager to read more by him.
3,The Beast is revealed - Aha!,"Alastair Crowley knew a thing or two about the manipulation of elemental forces. ""Aha!"" is wonderfully evocative of the thinking process behind one of history's most feared alchemists. I would suggest looking at the extraordinary ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years"" to see the most uncanny parallels between two men whose main difference is their fundamental motivation. One of these astounding men was driven by Love while the other was driven by Power. If certain key words were removed from the texts, you would be hard pressed to decide which book was about Crowley and which was about Jesus. For all Crowley fans, this is a 'must have'."
2,Do what thou wilt,"Aleister Crowley is an excellent metrical poet, often expressing profound depth and sublimity, however, Aha is terrible in contrast to some of his other writing, such as Ch'ing-Ching Ching or Tannhauser. Aha brutalizes and oversimplifies the very real inner experiences which characterize the magickal path, of which Aleister Crowley was a Master. Aha strips the magickal art to it's bare bones, glorifying the mundane methodical approach to magick. However, the poem redeems itself in that it is an excellent way of introducing the layman or aspiring initiate to the path. Otherwise it is boring, go buy something else."
5,awesome!,"i was really surprised when i listened to this cd... it sounds better than anything that comes out of my radio. the songs have great grooves and melodies, and the words are intense! i only listened to it once and i can't get ""maybe this time"" out of my head... does michael brandmeier have any other cds for sale?"
3,Leaks on the counter top.,"This is a great little drain board, but it allows the water to leak all over the countertop."
1,Don't bother to read this book.,"Don't bother to read this book. It overlooks Buster's artistry, and is strangely obsessed with the finances of each film. A much better book on Keaton is the one by Rudi Blesh, which is unfortunately unavailable now."
4,"Nice, freakish, BUT","Let's be honest, Jay was a freak, so if you have your ""5 Minutes"" and you need such kind of music, this is it!Besides that you can better use the CD for frisbee :-), nevertheless he created a whole genre of say weirdness in music...The price is a drawback, i would say that 10-12 USD are fair.Hermann"
3,not very sturdy,"I bought this item for a friend, when I received it was absolutely beautiful and she loved it. Unfortunately, the chain broke 3 days later with normal wear. I went to get the chain fixed and it some how got lost. Now I came back to the site to replace it and its 13 dollars more than when i originally bought it! As you can tell, this is not a chain that can be easily replaced with something you already have, keep that in mind."
4,Every Zune owner needs about three of these!,"Excellent price for just a basic, but SO necessary accessory for the under supplied Zune!Not everyone around you has a Zune, so therefore no borrowing power cables to charge it when it dies out in the field while you weren't paying attention to the power level.Great shipping, great price. I even use a couple of mine to sync with without a problem.Done."
2,Hackneyed,"Three reasons I rated this read only 2 stars:1. The primary female character wasn't nearly fleshed-out enough before she was thrown, rather unceremoniously, into bed with the primary male character. Throughout the book it was as if I was perpetually reading an introduction to Grace Jenkins--I never got a chance to get to know her.2. It seems as if the author took from something else she'd read a single theme that inspired her and turned it into a 150+ page thought, a thought that was underdeveloped (Ms. Foster tends to think faster than she types) and overdone.3. The author's attempt at a unique storyline is evident here but never quite gets its wings and flies, being bogged down in trite rhetoric--tragic.I purchased this book, and now want my money back. I highly recommend Susan Donovan's ""Knock Me Off My Feet"" instead of this book any day of the week and twice on Sunday."
2,Where's the story?,"The appeal of this author is lost on me. Her writing is better than many I've read but there is absolutely no substance to this story. No depth. No exploration of character beyond sexual attraction. The effort at emotions rings false because lust is always in the way. Her hero is a caveman, albeit a politically correct sensitive one, and the author went overboard emphasizing the heroine's size. I'm amazed this publisher used this book to launch a line of erotic romance - erotic <--now that's a laugh when applied to this book. It's barely simmering. Worth the price? Not on your life. It's category romance, nothing more, and should never have been published in trade paperback form."
1,No Good,"I read more than halfway through this book until I finally chunked it across the room out of disappointment. I have a couple of reasons as to why I didn't enjoy this book:I was pleasantly surprised at first that the author decided to make the main character Grace as a full, curvy woman who gets the man. I was sorely disappointed upon reading more into the book that Grace was written to be absurdly naive and even downright stupid at times which made me not care for her at all.Secondly, the plot was very weak, very underwritten and nearly bored me to tears.Thirdly, the sex scenes were mundane and did not excite me in the least bit! It seemed as if the author held back a lot when writing this book, especially when writing out the sex scenes especially when this was supposed to be an 'erotic' book. Trust me, it was FAR from that."
1,A Complete Flop,"If you don't mind stories loaded with clichés and dull-witted one-dimensional characters you might like this book. As for me, it's by far the worst in the erotic romance category I've read for years. Why this book bears the subtitle ""A Novel of Erotic Romance"" remains a mystery to me. There are of course several sexual encounters, but these are boring, stereo-typed and without any imagination, never mind the language.What annoyed me most, however, was the heroine - a twenty-five-year-old and because of her slight overweight continuously embarrassed virgin. Her constant ""I-am-so-fat-and-no-one-wants-to-look-at-me-whining runs like a thread through the whole story. Not that I would mind a heroine who for a change does not look like a cover-model - on the contrary. But please let it be one who wears every pound with pride and self-confidence. If you prefer a more sophisticated Erotic Romance try those by Robin Schone or Emma Holly."
5,The best ever!,"Lori Foster is a great writer but this is definitely her best yet. The hero and heroine are lovable, sexy and very likable. I've read a lot of romances but this is now my absolutely favorite. You won't regret reading this story."
3,As a Chubby Chick....,"Yeah I totally got into the fact that the heroine was a chubby gal amd snagged the heros attention because it CAN happen. However thats pretty much the extent of what I liked about it.There were too many area in the story that could've been portrayed better. Example, Grace without hesitation would defend ANYone that so much as insinuated a negative thought or remark against Noah but had absolutely no backbone for herself. How quickly she was able to roll over in bed without any inhabitions while being a virgin and then blush and hide behind a couch while fully clothed. One last thing that I didnt understand is why the mystery about his fiancee's lover?? Just didnt make sense.Overall, it was a cute story but not for the price and not enough for me to read Ben's story."
5,its like WOW if you like erotic romance,"One of the best stories I have read. I could not put it down until I was completely finished. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves tales of erotic romance, devoted love and about real everyday women. seXXXyAlso recommended:Any books from Lori Foster and connie mason, brenda jackson, lynne graham, kathy love............."
4,"Too hot, Too sweet, Too short","I loved this book! It's fun and sexy.I've read many complaints about the lack of story line. However that's one of the things that makes this book a keeper. It's main focus is centered on the relationship between Grace and Noah. Unlike most other books, the characters don't get swallowed up by long, overly dramatic plots. 75% of the book illustrates their feelings for each and of course the sex. It does have a small story line but it never draws your attention away from the matter at hand: Noah + Grace = sex (&love). I'm definitely happy with my purchase. I enjoy all kinds of novels. Some long, some short, some modest, some freaky, some suspensful, some lustful. ""Too Much Temptation"" is a welcome addition to my library!"
1,A pearl in a barrel of poo!,"Well, this one's a stinker. Oh I know all the hype about how great he was etc.etc. and how he kicked off the Band, but this is, to my jaded ears, pretty run of the mill, early rock 'n' roll. Largely forgetable. Except for ""Bo Diddley"". It's hard to tell it's the same band as the rest of the album. For my money it's worth the price of admission for this one song. There's a slight reprise, albeit in a different guise at the end in ""Down In The Alley"", that sounds almost like they're going into ""Bo Diddley"" part 2, but it doesn't quite make it. But the rest of the album - naa."
2,Expected a better product,"I don't recommend the Farberware pressure cooker. It was a hassle to use. It was hard to tell when the pressure was up so I couldn't time exactly how long I needed to cook the food, a minute too long and I could end up with mush. It took forever to cool the pot even when I ran it under cold water and wouldn't open for over 15min. After waiting so long to get it open I could have cooked my food in the oven instead, it would have been faster. I bought a Presto cooker instead and I LOVE it. As the other reviewer said it does not come with a steamer basket."
5,Need Midi Cable? Look no further,"This product works. I needed a cheap, midi cable and this product delivered. Connections feel solid especially for the price. I wouldn't call this thing highest quality but it definitely isn't cheap. Cable has a good thickness and feel to it as well. I already purchased another. I would definitely recommend to others"
2,MIDI Cable Review,"The item only works when plugged in a certain direction. You would think you could plug either MIDI to MIDI end in, but it must be in a certain direction to send/receive MIDI properly. My friend and I use it to link up our computers' external soundcards, and as my computer is the host and his the slave, it only works if the cable is plugged in that direction."
5,Quality cable!,"Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools. Works great! Firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything. Couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility."
3,great for people who dont have a ds!,i have a ds and nintendogs and this is a great game for people who dont own a ds! my cousin dosnt and he got this! its reall like nintendogs but its not for playing forever like nintendogs! its a mix of role play and i guess advanture with your dog lol! good game and its not copying!
2,Hoping for a biography,"I enjoyed the biographical portions of this book, but was disappointed that more than half of the book was written in the format of ""self help."" I wish Dr. Snyderman had stuck to telling her story and ""showing"" us her journey as a woman rather than ""explaining"" about women's lives."
2,"Nice song, terrible recordings","The songs are very nice but are recorded at different levels. When listening to them, you either can not hear it at a specific setting or you will go deaf at the same setting depending on which CD you are listening to.terrible job. Not recommending the product."
2,Cheaply Made,"Sharp enough to cut grass but gets stuck closed. Have to continually wipe it off, keep it clean and oiled. Very poorly made and quite plastic. Bahco use to have a better reputation but I guess metal is making way for plastic in all products. I wouldn't buy again."
1,Deeply disappointing,"I ordered this video based on the strength of its reviews and was more than surprised at their disparity with the actual work. This appears to be a student project, created by someone with very little experience, a great home computer system and some video editing software with irresistible plug-ins. I hate to knock someone's sincere effort, but I feel compelled to save others from spending so much without fair warning.Ineffectual static graphics are heavily layered over tiny windows offering only occasional glimpses of dancers' limbs. I can envision an effective use of textures and filters applied behind the dancers' movements, but as it is, the ethereal motive of the work is almost completely obscured by heavy-handed geometries and unsophisticated symmetries harshly superimposed.I'd give the student a C+ for effort, but I certainly wouldn't pay for the video if I had it to do over."
1,Very misleading,"The title and blurb of this book are very misleading. I started reading it thinking that it would be an intellectual review and summary of the hadith. What ensued was a very offensive ranting of the author's opinions on Islam, coupled with quotes from the hadith that were altered to fit his purposes. The author obviously has negative views towards Islam, and created negative interpretations for every hadith mentioned. There were also many blunt, overarching statements about Islamic life and practices that were simply untrue. This book is very insulting to the Islamic religious traditions, and if you are looking for unbiased information on the hadith I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere. Nothing in this book reflects the true teachings of Islam."
3,The Best of the Flamingos,"Other than ""Mi Amore"" and ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" I couldn't get into the rest of them. Plenty of songs though."
3,Okay But Well Spent,First of All the Chain Was Sooo Small but very Pretty. I think I got a good deal but had to give it to the girlfriend cause it was so Small. Needs more detail about the chain itself
1,Did not fit my RV gutters.,I have a Palamino Gazelle TT and these did not fit on the factory gutters. I think everyone should save the money and just put a clothespin on the end of your gutter. This technique works great and easily replaceable.
3,MURDER at the War,"Was hard to get into the plot at first, but then half way through it got easier.I give it three stars."
5,great lap desk,"Not really much to say...the only moving part is a zipper. (Hey, nice zipper!) But it is well made and, because it is wood, very attractive. If you are looking for a lap desk, this deserves a very serious look."
4,"Nice idea, but fell a little short...","It was a nice idea, but it fell a little short. It has several stories from people that are struggling with infertility. It didn't really offer much consolation, in my opinion."
4,Loved it!,"A clear, yet lively and fascinating look at many Jazz singers. It manages to be informative in a way that you hardly notice you're learning. I must say it helps the the subject matter is so engrossing. I couldn't help but enjoy myself all the way through this book. It also is a very accessible read so people with any level of knowledge of the subject are likely to find something to love about this book. Stormy Weather is another title I'd recommend for learning about Jazz singers and also female jazz musicians. I must say the more I learn about Jazz, the more I enjoy it and it is a musical form I fell for from the beginning."
5,Tears of Kohaku,"For All those Manga fans like myself who has been waiting to get to the end of the series, this is truly a beutiful ending."
2,bad info.,The end of the cable that adapts back to the scanner was the wrong size. have not found a scanner that it will work on.
3,Mrs.Brown's class,"Surviving The Applewhites by Stephanie S. Tolan was a facinating book. Jake Semple, a 13 year old boy becomes an Applewhite by getting placed in the Creative Acadamy. There, he figures out what he is an actor. I reccomend this book for fourth grade and higher."
4,Eat More Yogurt,"One of my children read this book for school and it was funny! Jake is a troubled youth who goes to stay with the Applewhites and attend their Creative Academy which offers a different, less structured approach to education. The family is a hoot. One lesson I learned from this book is, don't bypass the yogurt."
5,Fantastic Fiction,I am a little over halfway through with this book and cannot stop turning the pages! I have never been so interested in this book and you will love this if you have not read it yet!!!!!!! I am EXACTLY like E.D. and although I cannot realte to this book too much it really holds your interest and keeps your brain working. You always wanna know what is happening next and Destiney is too adorable! :-] Cordelia is so prissy and kindhearted and I love all the characters personalities. The author COULD NOT HAVE DONE BETTER!!! If I were asked what was one thing you would change in the story--well--nothing! It is PERFECT how it is!!!!! Coudn't be more pleased.THIS BOOK IS A MUST-READ
3,aka Surviving the Bagthorpes,"The Applewhites are cut from the same cloth as the Bagthorpes, another wildly creative and eccentric family created by British author Helen Cresswell. Nevertheless, I enjoyed getting to know this cast as well. Some of the characters and conflicts are too over-the-top, but this is a fun one. That said, the Newbery Honor designation is a bit baffling. A nicely written book about a funny, interesting group...but ""contemporary classic""?"
4,Surviving the Applewhites,"The title of my book is Surviving the Applewhites. The author of this book is Stephanie S. Tolan. My book is realistic fiction. There is a family who adopts a kid into there family becausae his parents didnt want him because he is bad. The Applewhites decided to put on a play called ""The Sound of Music"". They were going to put it on at the local theater. This book is for ages 11-13. I really liked this book. It was very suprising. They have alot of good scenes."
1,manure,omg i wanted to gag this book was so bad i thought i was going to throw upit was so bad it smelled like fresh manure this book lacked so much action im crying in my sleep it was so bad. actually im crying in my stockings- alex lopezi hated this book in action
2,Disappointing 45th Review,"Tolan's writing could have been more than just an average farce. The protagonist, a troubled youth, does not test for trust and acceptance with his arrival to the eccentric Applewhite household. She misses an opportunity to challenge the reader to wonder whether they could tolerate and overcome his past and form a bond."
1,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,Surviving the applewhitesBy Stephene S. TolanIn this book there is a 13 year old boy who gets in a lot of trouble. He finaly gets put in the last school that's willing to take him. He is placed in the Creative Acadamy. I found this book boring because it was hard to understand and there was too many details. I recommend this book for middle school and up.
3,"Interesting, but poorly organized","I found the content interesting, but I did not like the way the book was organized. It's a weird mix of a chronological and topical arrangement."
5,I Absolutely Love This Book!,"I borrowed this book from my local library for decor inspiration and because the photographs were stunning. I then purchased my own copy because I fell in love with the wonderful stories of the homeowners and the gorgeous pictures. While the majority of the homes featured are in the New York area, there is a wide range of home design on display here. My favorites were the NY townhomes as I just love the look of the woodwork and the beautiful fireplaces. Well worth it and makes a fine addition to any library or showpiece for your coffee table."
4,Smead Fle Jackets,These file jackets are economical and a good value. They are not that thick but for the price are quite nice.
4,Good quality,Good quality product. Purchased for myself. Pay attention to the size in description as it is a bit smaller than the 'look' in the picture. The colours are preety and it a very unique piece.
2,"""Look for the truth, but it is not all in here!""","This book is a disappointment! This book is supposed to be an exegetical study. Seems to me little effort is spent on that and a lot spent on trying to dispute various doctrines (generally Calvinism). If that is the purpose for the book then I think it should have been titled that way. Shame on Prof. Reese for presenting it this way. I understand that this is generally used as a text for beginning ministerial students that are not going to study the three basic languages but rather are going to trust the word of a scholar.On a positive note I found several areas of interest, but they didn't refer to exegesis. Another point it prompted me to refer back to the scriptures to search for myself. If a book does that it indeed has some worth."
1,"""Filled with fancies and empty of meaning""","Couldn't agree more with the above review. I found this trite, dull, and hugely uninspiring. Telling us repeatedly that Eliot was ""brilliant"" and constantly explicating the poems as Christian sermons is not at all helpful. Telling us that ""because landscape functions as a major symbol, lack of knowledge about the actual sources, as well as insufficient or even incorrect knowledge, can distort or even reverse its symbolic import"", is even less helpful -- particularly when, as it turns out, she herself gets her sources wrong (cf. the mistaken identification of the Lady in The Dry Salvages, later clarified by Helen Gardner).If there is any merit in this book it lies in the nice little anthology of soundbites the author has gleaned from other, more able critics.Oh, and the photos of course :p"
2,It's crimefighting time!,The COPS(Central Command Police Specialists) are a group of the best crime fighters in the U.S. led by fed agent V.P. Vess codename Bulletproof which are formed to fight against The Big Boss and his henchmen in Empire City the nation most corrupted and criminilized city.These 3 episodes contained in this disc are the 3 first produced by DIC animation in the 1988 season.The opening credits are omited and only the closing credits are included after the last ep.No special feats are included nor captions or subtitles following the standard in these low budget transfers.The audio and picture quality is good and that is the only good thing in this disc.We deserve more eps and these released in the way of a complete season like G.I. Joe and others.
2,minimalist survey for mainstream tourist,"This 2008 portable edition out in 2007 gives an overview for the mainstream, first time tourist to the area. The back cover reads,Experience a place the way the locals do...."" but in reality it'shardly more than an introduction for the non-trekker types. Maybe someone who wants to play golf, buy drinks and wade in the Ocean will gets something from this little volume; otherwise it's a superficial overview of the area.I bought the book primarily to ""discover"" more about Manzanillo and was disappointed that it gave so little information."
5,More practical than the full-sized one,"I prefer the pocket launcher over the full-sized one as I can throw it in my back-pack or even put it in my jeans pockets when we go places. If your dog is just a back-yard dog, you may not need the smaller size, but for an active adventure dog, this is a GREAT product. I use it with racquet balls a lot for my medium sized dog, since tennis balls are like sand paper for your dog's teeth. Less dirt/sand swallowing, less saliva, higher bounce.I just wish you could pick the color. Who in the world would ever go and knowingly purchase that ugly green?!?!??!"
3,A Tired Dog is a Good Dog,A tired dog is a good dog.Chuck it launchers will save your arm and prevent your hands from getting all slimey. My dog loves to play catch and this is a must have.Combine this with a glow in the dark ball and youre good to go--regardless of the time of day (or night).
5,every fetching dog needs one,"My border collie/lab is never more excited than when we say Chuck it. We have to spell it when we talk about it and aren't ready to spend an hour playing outside. Having tennis elbow in both arms, this is a life (well at least arm) saver!"
3,brighteye,"thr large size was too stiff for me. the medium size is perfect for me;i do not have much arm strenght and my dog is a real jock. he loves to run and jump and this product does it for us. he gets a real workout dispite my ""weak throw"" by my using this launcher."
5,Great for my Golden,My Golden fits 2 balls in her mouth so she doesn't have to give any back for me to chuck again. With this she can fit 2 but the front one keeps falling out and give me a chance to pick up and chuck again. Great size and so sturdy.
4,Taking fetch to a whole new level,"Why didn't I buy this earlier? It would have saved me days of sore arm muscles caused by throwing tennis balls. This little piece of plastic and rubber is truly amazing, with barely a flick of my wrist the ball goes soaring many times further than I could have ever thrown. When the ball is retrieved, I have the added bonus of skipping the usual displeasure of grabbing a slobbery, filthy ball with my bare hands. I hardly need to bend down and it's back in the Chuckit and ready to go. My puppy was exhausted for days after our first outing with the Chuckit and the peace and quiet was pure bliss. The ONLY complaint that I have about this (and why I haven't given it 5 stars) is that I can't choose the color - shallow, I know, but I miss the option."
4,babbs,"I have a family of dog lovers,so purchased as gifts, but the snow has actually been to deep to try it out, so far. It does keep you hands free of dog slobber."
1,Plastic screw-on base broke almost immediately,"I wish I had read reviews before buying this blender. The plastic base broke almost immediately -- after only several uses! The plastic appears to be faulty. It cracked and fell apart under normal use -- allowing the contents to seep out. I was going to request a replacement screw-on base, but other reviews indicate that the replacements also broke apart. I guess this nearly new blender is destined for the trash. What a waste of money."
1,"Work for a short time, then base began to smoke.","I just received this and tried to make a smoothie using store-bought smoothie mix. It blended the ingredients for about 20 seconds, semed to be working fine, then suddenly started to get louder, and louder. Before I could turn it off smoke began to pour out of the base. I quickly pulled the plug. It continued to smoke for about another 30 seconds. I assume I received a defective one, but if you use this particular model you probably want to have fire extinguisher handy. :) This is being returned."
4,Very Well Organized and Documented Concepts,"This book is very well written, but is pretty heavy on the linguistic terminology. Nevertheless, I found it quite profound on how all the grammatical concepts are organized and documented. Some of the concepts are even applicable to Mandarin (Putonghua), which makes this great for contrast and comparison to that language. I have yet to find any book that organizes and quantifies grammatical structures in Mandarin; This is ironic considering the instruction of Cantonese seems dissmissed in mainland.The only one thing that I can fault this book, is the lack of Chinese characters. It uses Yale romanization system to document the concepts, which in and of itself is not bad, but one needs the written Chinese characters in order to understand how a single character can fulfill many grammatical roles. Despite this, this book is invaluable supplement for anyone serious about learning Cantonese."
3,shame about characters,"This is a good way of learning Chinese, using patterns, and it uses the Yale romanization. It does not contain any characters though."
1,The size of the puzzle is too small,The size of the crossword image is too small making it difficult to work the puzzles. I believe this was developed for a very early version of Windows. Absolutely no assistance from the techincal support website.
2,Incorrect scale on AC-Voltage,"Although the meter is accurate from what I have tested, it does have a few issues in my opinion:(a) the 500V scale setting does not match the graduations on the meter - it is labeled ""250VAC"". Therefore, one must double the reading measured on the meter to get the real world value. Example: on 500VAC scale setting, meter displays 55VAC for a 110V receptacle.(b) test leads are not replaceable. They are hardwired to the meter.(c) AA battery not included(d) Not made in USA"
4,Skeptical at first,"When I received this book, I was surprised that it appeared the author had self-published. I was very happy to find as I began reading, I could not distinguish this book from one distributed by a major publisher. The story line is good with different theories, as usual, about the powers and origins of the vampire. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this genre and is interested in supporting the independent writer."
4,Fish and Shellfish: The Cook's Indispensable Companion,The book was well worth the money but I was hoping to receive it before Christmas because it was a gift. I received the book on January 6.
5,Another Racer Is Born!,"I just played this game last nite with friends, and I REALLY LIKE IT!!! It's funny when all of a sudden your opponent races right over you and takes the lead... But it's a lot of fun... Now I'm gonna have to get this one too... Thanx guys for getting me hooked... You all know who you b... (TT and your wingman, GC.)"
1,This game TRULY sucks big time,"Man, this $50 game from the Big Corporation called Electronic Arts totally stinks. It's got some of the worst car racing physics I've ever seen, and the controls are totally user-unfriendly. The cars handle like crazy, and the A.I. of the computer-controlled racers is totally uneven and takes away the last bit of fun from this game. Don't waste your $50 on a crappy game like this. I'm already very pissed I wasted $7 renting it from Blockbuster. Even though I could have kept it for two weeks, I returned it after less than one. This game truly sucks, big time.If you want a good racer for the PSP, check out Ridge Racer, which, admittedly, is a different kind of racing experience but at least it's got good car physics models in it. Or just wait for the release of Gran Turismo or Burnout."
5,I hate racing games.,"I do, every racing game I haved played just doenst hold my interest. Yet when my PSP came with NFS:UR I had no idea it would become my favoret PSP game. The Graphics are amazing! Soundtrack is very good. The cars can be modified in an almost unlimited way from the paint job, to the turbo setup. I cant put this one down and I think it should be one of the games you get with your PSP. I feel this game takes advantage of what the PSP can do as a gamming machine."
4,"very good, not great","We bought the 9.5 cubic foot model in December 2007. Setup was easy and it seems to be built well, thick plastic, and durable. One problem is when its full and it becomes difficult to put the lid on. The compost weight inside the plastic bin deforms the top into a oval shape. The lid remains round and that requires additional effort to close. overall it seems to be making compost, so 4/5 stars."
3,Safari: Pteranodon,"It is what it is. Over all the quality for this type of toy is as expected. If I were to complain about anything it is the inconstancy of the painting of the facial features but, it's almost to be expected for the price point. All in all it's good for what I bought it for."
4,Inspired and captivating.,"I had heard great things about Jello Biafra's spoken word albums, so I gave this one a try. The breadth and scope of Jello's material is enormous. He's like an encyclopedia of political dissent. Occasionally he gets unfocused, and some of his arguments are a little out there. But, Jello is witty and clever (and funny as hell), and there is not a dull moment in the entire three-hour album. I also enjoyed the fact that the album was recorded at a live performance. It creates a much more real and intimate atmosphere. Also, as a journalism student in college, I must say that Jello's thoughts on corporate censorship and the decline of journalistic integrity hit the nail right on the head. Disc two is my personal favorite. You probably wouldn't have even heard about this album unless you already agree with Jello's views, but it's still worth your hard earned wage-slave money."
1,"Was excited, then disappointed.","This bag is a replacement for the same bag made 5 years ago. The last one was great but is showing a lot of wear after 5 years of heavy use. Since it's about to rip completely, it was time to replace it.After receiving this bag, I noticed the material was a little lower quality. No worries, if I get 2-3 years out of a $30 bag, I'm happy enough. I started transferring my things from the old one. The first thing I noticed is that the new bag no longer has a divider in the main zipper section. Slight disappointment, but I can live with that.As I was putting my other items in the front zip-around pocket, I noticed that my USB memory key had slid partially through a small gap they left in the bottom sides. SERIOUSLY?? WHY DID THEY LEAVE A GAP IN THE BOTTOM OF THE COMPARTMENT?? It's just big enough for USB keys, pens, coins to slide out as you're walking down the street.I uploaded a picture into the Customer images section, take a look. I'm returning it."
1,Copy-cat punk.,"I'm getting a little tired of the run-o-the mill copycat punk band. There is just too many of them. 7-10 Split is a prime example of one. There is nothing new, original, or even half way interesting about this band. There is some good Christian lyrics of course, but they are sadly enough wasted on very poor music."
1,VERY small and no scent.,"These candles were MUCH smaller than I thought they would be and were totally NOT worth the price. The scent was barely there. The candles themselves were obviously old stock and on top of that they were returned by another customer over 4 years ago .. and then shipped to me, when I placed my order. The previous customer's shipping info was still on the box.They say these candles are 10 ounces each ... they must be including the weight of the glass jar in that as well. They are about 3 inches high and 2 inches across the mouth of the jar.I was totally disappointed and do not recommend these to anyone."
4,"Holmes and Russell""s grown-up relationship begins","This second novel in the series begins as Mary reaches adulthood. She has completed her degree and finally has access to her inheritance. The question now is, what about Holmes?My favorite scenes in this novel are Mary's first interaction with Holmes and their last interaction. Simply wonderful.One disappointment with this novel is the weakness of Margery Childe. While perhaps realistic (none of us are perfect), I felt a great need for further explanation of WHY at the end of the book-- why a strong person could make such a horrendous mistake (no spoilers here...).Readers should note that, unlike The Beekeeper's Apprentice, one mystery dominates this novel (and subsequent installments). Overall a very interesting tale, and a very satisfying second installment in the series."
4,great family story,"This is a terrific story! It is touching, funny, and to think it really happened. Family values are the message in this people-to-people around the world saga which is never cloying but often bittersweet."
4,Book a bit dated but still relevant,"Although the artwork examples are dated, this book is a terrific resource for print collectors and those interested in preserving paper in general. Written in a very clear and logical approach, the chapters detail the history, lore, collecting, and conservation of prints in an easy to read fashion. What I enjoyed most is the ""examples"" section, made up of moderately priced (no Picasso lithos or Rembrandt etchings) contemporary prints, mostly from UK artists. This book is serious about printmaking and conservation.There should really be a second edition of this book for the new millennium since there are new conservation methods and techniques for printmaking."
1,...,"Don't be fooled like I was. This is not the full version of TRIII. It is actually more of a demo. It only contains the 4 India levels. Once you complete them, game over. I guess the price should have been a clue, but I figured that it was priced low simply because the game is several years old. There is nothing else to clue you in to this abbreviated version if you're new to the TR series. They should at least tell you its a demo and not the full version of TRIII."
3,WR10 not for mobile homes,"I purchased this WR 10 at Walmart's for $29.00. AM and FM reception is fine, but no weather reception at all inside a mobile home. I'll be returning mine, as I do live in a mobile home, too much metal I suppose. I tried in in every room and nothing!! But take it outside and it works fine."
1,Miserable,"This radio is a miserable reciever. I live about 12 miles from a NOAA transmitter with absolutely no impediment to the signal from hills etc. I could not pick them up with the included antenna. I bought an add-on antenna from Radio Shack and could then barely recieve the station, sometimes readable, other times not at all! This is a useless product. I threw it away. It would be totally inadequate in an emergency."
4,if you like Philip K Dick,"It's been tough to find a book in the ""mind"" of Philip K Dick since his death, except for Michael Bishop's "".. Alas"" it seemed the mind-game genre was done and then I found this. Mr. Knight's previous had never floored me (except his true hisotry book ""The Futurians"") but this is something else. I see lower scores here and figure that the type of story is just ""quirky"" or ""cute"" to many readers but if you're really into reality-questioning fiction then this is one not to miss.If you like it, do try the later PKD novels (starting with Maze Of Death) and, this may sound odd but it's true, go back and re-read Socrates for fun."
3,A blurred look into a post apocalyptic Europe,"Another good installment it the palladium books series, however, you come away lacking a solid understanding of some of the more important elements. The detail on the war machines of the mighty NGR and Triax is impressive, as is the artwork on these elaborate engines of destruction. However, there is not one word of information about the people, or the form of government, or what daily life might be like in this New German Republic. All we know is that the population is almost entirely human. Not enough. How are they governed? Are civillians allowed to carry weapons and wear body armor? And for heavens sake, What is the estimated size of the NGR's millitary? What is the weather like down there? We need to know these things. This book is still a masterpiece that is absolutly needed for any Rifts enthouiast, but a little more attantion to detail would have made it a lot better.The Gamesmaster"
2,Ok video,"Course two isn't as bad as 1 and 3. However, the dramatic music doesn't fit with the low budget self made video. This project isn't shown from the start of the project. You can't learn how to lay out the portrait from this tutorial. His explanation is that it takes him like a week or so to do one and can't video everything. So he has everything already laid out and teaches you how to blend smudge and erase your way to completion. All the steps leading up to the likeness is left out. Basically he is teaching you x, y and z. A - W are left out. The video itself is a low budget self made product. Frankly, if your going to make me sit through it you could at least teach the project from START to completion. Having said all that, I think the artist has talent, his portrait is very nice, I would hang it on my wall."
2,Mickey Mouse Club House Toy -Mickey is lonely,"Although my 22-month old son enjoys playing with this toy, I was disappointed with a few things ... 1. It only includes one figuring ...Mickey. I can't find any of the other figurines at the local stores. And, I see the figurines come with additional Mickeys so I would end up with more than one Mickey. 2. The slide and side door keep coming off ... too easily. In addition, the trap door at the top always comes off. For the price, it's not worth it. It should have included at least two figurines. Not just one."
2,WASTE OF MONEY,"How disappointing. The hype on these products were blown WAY out of proportion. Like all other reviews from December 26 and on, the clubhouse slide doesn't even come close to staying attached. Also the yellow foot door will not stay on either. One instruction was provided on attaching the talking base, but that's it. I had to look at the box and also guess to figure out where the stickers are supposed to go. Haven't had any problem with the figurines.......yet. Bottom line thinking was obviously a major influence in the development of this toy. I bought two with the intention of selling one on ebay. I am going to return it instead."
3,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,This is all my 3 year wanted for Christmas last year. I don't think it's worth the cost at all. It doesn't really keep either of my boys attention for long at all. The pieces that came with it are never with the toy. The slide that attaches to it is such a poor design that it doesn't stay on for more than 2 minutes when they do play with it Also the way it opens is too hard for my 1 and a half year old to do himself so he is constantly bringing the whole thing to me to open. I would not recommend this toy at all.
2,Seems cute but not worth money,"I bought this for my 4 and 2 year old Mickey lovers. The toy took 2 hours to get together and WILL NOT stay together. The ""kitchen"" is unrecognizable and the characters keep talking in the wrong voices. Overall I spent 65 dollars on this between the characters and playset and wish I could return it. The kids however seem to like it, they only play with the house part since the slide and boot won't stay on. And they keep asking for the glove balloon! It doesn't have one"
3,"Admittedly poorly made, but my kids still love it","My 5 year old twin sons each got one of these for Christmas this past year. No, we don't have any of the characters that go with the set, except for the Mickey that came with it. However, my kids use the characters that came in a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse bath set sold in the Disney store for $9 and they are the right size. Of course, these bath characters don't animate when you put them in the clubhouse, but the kids don't seem to mind. I agree that the slides are ridiculous. Ours don't fall off, but that's because we can't get the slides on in the first place. We just sort of lean the slides against the clubhouse. But like I said in the title, my boys adore their clubhouses, especially on Saturday mornings when they watch the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse cartoon on the disney channel."
1,Save your money...,I bought this toy for my son for Christmas and finally threw it out today. He only played with it a few times because he would get so frustrated by the slide and boot constantly falling off. The sound also didn't work. I expected much more from Disney.
1,DID NOT WORK AT ALLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MY PHONE DID NOT READ ITNOR DID MY COMPUTER READ ITBE CAREFUL IF YOU BUY, BECAUSE IF YOUR ITEM IS DEFECTIVE, LIKE MINE WAS, IT WILL BE ANOTHER HASSLE."
5,tunes,I use it in my cell phone & it works great. Have about 10/11 cds on it now with a little more than half the memory left to use. No problems.
3,NIce Card,This is the first time I purchased a card like this and At first I was a little skeptical. I got this card for my phone and when I first put it in my phone it could not be read. Then I tried the computer and the same results. I had to go to the company website to reformat the card and hope it works. Turns out it did and so far I have no more problems with it.
5,"Great Value, Great Service, Great Product",I bought this for my new LG Chocolate cell phone and it works great. I bought it from one of the Marketplace seller on Amazon and their service was excellent. I have experienced no problems in the several months I have had it.
5,Good price!,"Purchased this for my lg chocolate and it works great! You can store tons of songs, music, pix, and videos on this tiny card. It is really easy to transfer files with the included adapter and a memory card reader/writer. It comes just in a plastic case with both the microsd card and the adapter but there are no instructions. It is used like all other memory cards so you don't really need the instructions anyways. It is so much cheaper than any other place I've found in stores or online!"
5,Great for the price,I ordered 7 of these to be used on our recent tour of America National Parks with our 5 grandchildren. We had set up a whistle call for contact and they learned how to find north and became more interested in the direction they were taking. They were able to attach it to their belts so it stayed with them everywhere we went . Well worth the money!
2,"Very basic but the word ""Master"" should be excluded","This glossy basic approach and terminology for beginners may be suitable. But for a 3 DVD set and the word ""Master your setup"" I expected more substance. After covering the basics and he just starts to touch on the DIY details Greg punts and instructs you to take it to a trained professional technician. What? Give me a break! If Greg is going to include the word ""master"" in the title immerse yourself with some substance or at least get your hands dirty. Disappointed to say the least!If you are looking for more details try Stewart Macdonalds pitchman Dan Erlewines DVD series especially his 3 dvd series on fretting. Greg has a section for fretting but completely ignored any specific details. Next time Greg at least include some nice close up graghics or diagrams of what a crown should look like or neck relief.I hope this helps in your decision process."
4,Exact description of Java on RTS's,"The programming language Java is widely used for web applications, servers, compilers. The concurrency aspect is also known to all of us. But for real time systems development in Java was awaited. I being a teacher of RTS course was looking for the language to introduce the real time system concepts. This book is correct solution. It starts with real time threading. Scheduling, Synchronization, timing issues of Real time systems are explained with implementaion and verification aspects. The book is correct choice for learning, developing, real time systems with complete programming language Java."
5,Good calculator,"I needed this calculator for my physics course after the one I used in high school broke. As always, it's just a standard graphing calculator. It's a shame that they're still so expensive, though- however, I saved a fortune buying it here vs my school's bookstore. It's really hard to open the packaging."
3,Gets the job done,I paided extra to have it shipped quickly so i could use it in my chem class but it came late. The calculator itself works perfect
1,Did not work at all,This calculator do not include batteries in the package. Although I know it's used but this calculator didn't work properly at all
3,happy with purchase overall,Book was in good condition - a little worn. Packaging was slightly bent and a little torn but could have been US mail fault. Was still happy with purchase.
4,Perfect for my office,"I started to feel really bad about the large amounts of paper goods that i was throwing away on a daily basis at work. So i brought in a couple dishes and use this dish drainer in my office. it works just fine and is the perfect size for a couple bowls , a plate and a coffee mug."
3,Smaller that I would have liked,"All others I have found are too large to fit in the sink. This one is small, but it works."
5,GREAT DISH RACK FOR A COUPLE!,"This is a great dish rack if you want to maximize your counter space. I have a corner sink and have been unsuccessful in finding a dish rack to work in the limited sink angle. This works great for a couple to handle overflow dishes not washed in dishwasher and leaves much counter space open for more important things like cooking! I normally don't write reviews, but wanted to pass along to help someone w/ the same dilemma. It looks good and is compact. Requires some hand drying of larger items like skillets and pots, but it's not like that takes a great amount of time! You won't be disappointed, especially at this price. Can be washed in the dishwasher also!"
5,RV dish drainer,I have been looking for a dish drainer for sometime and since space is always an issue not everything will work. This fits the sink perfectly. I am very pleased with the product.
4,Small but works great,This item is really small but the description states that so you already know that. It does fit in a travel trailer sink really well and serves the purpose. It is well made.
5,its great,"I love it a lot.Although the little trucks are oversised and larger than the plane,i still love it.i love it!"
1,Shame on the author,"This book is written for a second grader. Shame on the author for being so patronizing to those of us who suffer from this life-altering diease. I'm not a psychologist, but I could have written the general information in this book -- in fact it could have been written for just about any disease by any Psych 101 student. It's a form letter. Don't bother."
2,Actions speak louder than words,"My wife and I wanted to teach our children Hebrew, so they can communicate with their grandparents and other family members in Israel. We thought this book would help them gain a foundational vocabulary, and indeed it delivers in this area. I loved the individual pictures with the words in English, transliteration, and block text, right next to a ""Where's Waldo"" style large scene illustrating the use of the words. But as I began reading and looking at the book with my children, I realized that on most of the pages, the scenes showed unruly children and frustrated, flustered parents. Children are portrayed as disobedient, unhelpful, mischievous, and self-absorbed. Would it have been that difficult to create scenes wherein children were modeling good behavior instead of bad? If you do decide to buy this book, I would read it with your child and consider making the pictures into a game of finding ""what not to do""."
1,Not for young kids,"My 10-year-old daughter checked out this book from her school library. She came to me upset with what she had just read. There were a few pages of sexually explicit content between 2 high school teenagers. She was embarrassed and ashamed that she had checked it out. I read through it and was not impressed with the language. Thankfully, I was able to talk to my daughter about these issues. Just make sure your child is mature enough to handle the graphic language."
5,a book that's off the chain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Life is Funny is the best book i have read in a long time it is now one of my favorites if you love books that have a variety of characters you'll like this book and the way everyone knows each other in some way or another is cool this book pulls together a variety of life styles races and ethnicity's but if your squirmish about bad language (which if your a teenager i doubt it) you'll be a little shocked but it's still a good bookdo not read without adult supervision if you are under aged this book is of the ch ch ch chainnnnnnnnnnn
2,No substitute for a master.,"I got this book because it was so highly recommended by others, but when I started reading it, it turns out that the author warns to STOP reading it, because it will only confuse you, he said, and you absolutely must have an enlightened master who can read the book and explain everything to you. Well, I don't yet have such an enlightened master, so I have no need for the book. And if I did have such an enlightened master, I imagine they would not need to read from this deliberately confusing book in order to give me instructions on how to attain enlightenment.Please let me know if I have misinterpreted something..."
4,pretty good,this was one of those books that got really good at the end of it i would bet that a lot of people give up on it- but it is ok if you stick with it
3,"Great Top, Not so great bottoms","I love the top, being spandex however, it does snag...The bottoms, bad design. The have a tie through two metal grommets. After my little girl wore them a few times on vacation in the POOL, and I hung dry them, the grommets rusted and spread to the surrounding fabric. There's no need for the tie because it's just decorative, it doesn't gather the waist of the shorts for a snug fit. Disappointed for the price!"
1,Overpriced Wastebasket,"We are a green business, trying to do our part by recycling our trash in the blue bins our disposal company told us to buy. Why is this otherwise-ordinary trash can almost $50? A similar non-blue bin is less than $15. Not a good deal, and makes me wonder why the Rubbermaid corporation isn't making recycling easier."
4,good textbook for teaching both nonmajors and majors in biology,"As a profesor, I use this book in my nonmajors Biology and Society class where it functions well to introduce nonscientist to interesting aspects of biotechnology and the important issues surrounding the science. I also use it in my upper-level genetics class where it works as a nice introduction to biotechnology (and review, in some cases) allowing us to delve deeper into the science and issues using assigned papers. I like it a lot, as do my students; and compared with most textbooks it doesn't cost much. I wish it had more color photographs."
5,For those who love true science fiction,"The story, not the acting, is what truly drives this short film...forget the makeup, the settings, the budget filmaking...what this is, is a perfect example of what science fiction is really all about...the complex theories of time and space...and an ending that is absolutely the type that drives conversation of theories and speculation...any true SF fan knows that a good story is one that starts debates and even arguments on what the causes and outcome of such a situation could be."
3,"Good Story, Horrible Acting","First of all, paying 1.99 for a 30ish minute short story seems expensive. However, in the history of sci-fi there have been many great short stories, but this is not one of them. The plot is very good but the horrific acting and gore make it far too sensational. The acting and gore are so distracting, the good of the story line is lost. I found myself just wanting to get to the end to see what the plot mystery was."
4,A Feast for the Eyes,"This is a book to savor, packed with beautiful close-ups of plants as well as photos of the author's various borders. Written by someone who obviously loves both the plants and the planting process, it's like taking a walk with an experienced gardner and getting the inside story on each flower."
2,Error Prone,"The errors that bothered me the most were those found in the practice test on the cd. Several of them were due to sloppy programming. As soon as I became aware of how many errors there were in the book as well, I never went near it again. Who needs to memorize incorrect info? Look elsewhere for more reliable help."
2,Too many errors!,"Although this book covered necessary topics I found it to be full of typographical, grammatical, and most importantly, errors relating to internet technology. It made me question the reliability of the content. I was amused when one of the authors referred to an application as ""the ultimate killer app."" Can't you just see a System Admin. defining an application like that?"
3,Not as impressive as other products,"Relative to the reviews on Amazon, this product underperforms. It is an OK car wash, but not as good as several I've used in the past. I'm having to use much more to get the same cleaning action. Disappointing, relative to the rave reviews. I'd recommend trying others which are highly rated. I believe you will end up with better cleaning, and need to use much less of the product."
3,Not as good,The Secret Language of Birthdays is better than this one. Bought this based on reviews but not nearly as happy with this.
5,Thorough Reference,There is just about everything you would want to know about yourself and others. There is a tremendous amount of information and it takes a while to absorb it but it is definitely worth it.
5,very good book...lots of detail ...,This is a good book. it gave alot of detail about my birthday..my perfect mate...the secret me..It was me to a T!!! i learned things about me that i never really understood. I recommend this book to anyone that wants a lil insight to who they really are.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this blender when my boyfriend broke his jaw and required an all liquid diet. I used it very little. When I did use it, it was quite weak in power. It finally died on me after a couple uses. Overall this was a very disappointing purchase."
2,Flower That Shattered the Stone,I have no comment because I cannot figure how to listen to the song requested.
1,Ugly movie...,This is one of the ugliest movies that I have had the displeasure of sitting through. Where does the money come from to make this kind of thing? I wish I could give it no star.
2,Bubblegum ditties of the Baby Boomers,"Here are the obscure recordings of ""Flash-in-the-Pan"" artists and ""hits"" of us Baby Boomers! Stuff that was the temporary fodder of Casey Kasum and the ""top 40' ""Hit"" radio stations across the United States in the '60's.One Hit Wonders that were played over and over in their time then promptly forgotten. They were re'released in the many incarnations of ""K-Tel,"" then forgotten again as these K-Tel records found their way to thriftshops, then landfills.If you want to reminisce about all that ""bubblegum"" heard as a child, be more imaginative! Pass this one by and instead purchase The Resident's Third Reich and Roll! Only The Residents could give these ""one hit wonders"" the ROASTING they DESERVED!"
2,Looks great but....,I bought this for traveling and as far as overall appearance and functionality it looked great. The problem was 3 days into the trip the bottom left shoulder strap came off. I sewed it back on and then a few days later THE TOP of the left shoulder strap came off. Next time I think I'll pay a higher price for a better product.
2,Unsatisfied,"Although the cable functions, I am not happy with the quality. My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig."
1,Don't get the Kindle Edition,"Even that you can guess that Kindle edition of the book is not the same as the one shown here, the major problem is that you don't get even closer to the last edition, so don't get it. I believe that this is a major drawback of these e_books, publishers are given agreements only of second rate material (at least in science books, I can not comment on other fields).It is a pity that technology goes in one direction but some business people do not want to move at the same speed and direction, I wonder why is this."
4,"Great game WD, but hate the interruptions.","For the Strategy/RPG enthusiast, I bring you one of the latest titles in the genre. Its called Vanguard Bandits. Vanguard was an alright game. It included some pretty sweet mechs called ATAC's (my personal favorites: Ultragunner and Toreador) and you had to stop someone from taking over the world with the evil equivalent to the games hero mech, Ultragunner, known as the Zulwarn that got its energy from the blood of people. Sounds kind of common, doesn't it. The new feature of this game that I call the ultimate, yet good looking, interruption. This is the 3-D battle sequences. This game contains a turn-based battle system, and when you choose your attack it shows how your opponent chooses to defend, fades into a 3-D battle sequence, fades back out and continues to do this for every battle. If they were going to do this, why didn't they just make it a Xenogears style battle screen. Oh well, it is a great game and I recommend it to any Strategy/RPG enthusiast."
2,Eh - purchased for LUNAR 2 Demo,I remember this game from when I was much younger. I didn't like it very much as well. Even trying it now - I could care less for it. Purchased item to complete Lunar 2 set. This game is not worth the price it is going for now. It is at a high price only due to the LUNAR 2 demo disc included. Ignore - unless you're looking for the demo disc as well.
4,Great beginner book,This book has been great for learning how to read & write in Arabic. The only problem is that it's not exactly geared toward people who want to teach themselves Arabic. The book assumes you have a teacher. I only just found out that there's an answer key so I'm hoping that helps out a lot.
5,Classic Cartoon,"I didn't realize it at the time, but Ren & Stimpy quite possibly could be the BEST cartoon animation we've seen on television in the last 50 years. Shows like the Simpsons, Southpark & Family Guy all have superb writing...yet they're certainly not visually appealing (unless you find humor in the lack of animation in Southpark).Watching the episodes on these DVDs really floors me with all the visual gags. For being limited animation, there sure is alot of lively movement from the characters.The quality varies from episode to episode, for the most part these episodes look really nice. Some of the more ""worn"" episodes add to the nostalgia charm...I'm glad I purchased these DVDs - I forgot just how great this cartoon used to be."
4,JOY!,"This is a very good DVD release of Ren & Stimpy. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the show and wants to own it on DVD. The only thing I don't like about this set is that my favorite episode (Haunted House) has a scene that is cut. Aside from that, I still enjoy this product and I know you will too, you eediot!"
4,"Slightly cut, yes, but good nonetheless","I bought the set before reading the reviews here, and was a little worried that I might have wasted my money. All in all, I don't agree with any assessments about poor picture quality, the colors look great; the only episode with video artifacts I noticed was the original ""Big House Blues,"" but that contains the waking up scene that I had never seen.Yes, I compared ""Big Baby Scam"" to my old video tape pulled from a Nick broadcast. Why the whistling is missing is beyond me; someone to claim that this was a Spike edit to allow additional commercials is ludicrous as that scene amounts to not much more than 5 seconds. Maybe it was a legitimate error and will be corrected in a later DVD pressing, I don't know.My disc 3 had digital errors and refused to track properly at 20 minutes; I'm hoping a replacement solves that problem.All in all, a good collection, still worth seeking out unless you're a complete eeediot."
3,Only Powdered Toast Man can fix this injustice,"Apparently UNCUT means crappy Spkie TV transfers where 3-5 minutes were edited out of the Nick version to fit in more commercials. If you're looking for the original Nick episodes with extras then look elsewhere. The extras are great but this can hardly be what most people are expecting when they see the word UNCUT.If you do buy this and are looking for the ""banned"" episode, it's on disc two not disc three like the packaging says.I will be returning my copy and sticking with the Nick VHS transfers I have on DVD."
5,I Don't Care About What's Missing!,"You know I got this as a Christmas present for my husband, but I and I do mean me, ME! I couldn't wait to watch it, so I gave it to him early. We love it, and I can't believe I still remember a lot of the dialogue! It was just fun to see it all again. A lot of people complain about some missing parts, yeah it was annoying at first, but I got over it quick when Space Madness came on ""my fav"". So who cares if a few bits and pieces are missing? Nick probably won't fix it, so enjoy it!"
3,"no ""man's best friend"" episode otherwise good","there was no episode ""man's best friend"" as advertised. otherwise i loved the show. will have to look for the banned episode on you tube."
4,"Not perfect, but still well worth the money","Ren and Stimpy was the first show I became obsessed with, watched religiously from beginning to end, over and over again, and it fills my heart with joy to finally have a set of the best Ren and Stimpy episodes. As has been mentioned repeatedly in the reviews on this web site, there are minor cuts in some of the episodes; however, they aren't as bad as everyone's been saying. (I didn't even notice any until ""Big Baby Scam"".) Should these cuts have been there? No. Do they detract from the enjoyment of the episodes? No, at least not to me. The commentary, extra footage, and the ""In the Beginning"" feature are great extras, but I feel that there could have been more to it; commentary on every episode, for example. In the end, I have to give this set 4 stars simply because of the genius that is John K's creation, but must deduct one for imperfect DVD production values. However, I still think the set's worth every penny."
3,Edited For Some Reason-TERRIBLE commentary,"At least this is on DVD. Awesome show. Hilarious. But...Some edits are present, but it is better to have 99.9 percent than none. So I took 1 star off for that. And 1 star off for the terrible commentary.The most annoying thing is the commentary!! My God, there is one guy who I can't identify that laughs and laughs and laughs and laughs and says how awesome it is and laughs and laughs and laughs. This guy is SO annoying. SO ANNOYING. I felt like Ren when he gets pissed off at Stimpy- rip his voice box out. STOP WITH THE LAUGHING and contribute something to the conversation. But alas, no one does. WORST commentaries ever. Just terrible."
4,"Great to have, yet still disappointed","It was great to see a piece of nostalgia like this. Although as I viewed my favorite episodes I frequently found myself saying ""What he** was that?"". Even though the boxset says complete and uncut, there are distracting cuts made. There are parts where they zoomed in on the frame as a way of editing a scene to the point that you cant tell what's happing and some scenes cut out completely. If your going to release a DVD for adults to enjoy a piece of their childhood, don't cheat them by selling them a cut up version and tell them it's complete and uncut."
5,Great Box Set,I bought this box set the other night. I'm so glad there finally on dvd. I hope they release Rocko's Modern Life on dvd real soon as well.
3,uncut???,"well, i like many of the people who purchased this dvd set was impressed by the fact that this dvd was ""uncut"" and hence decided to purchase. unfortunately and to my dissapointment this was not the case. particularly in ""kilted yacksmen"" where, in the song the word and sound HELL was censored. in australia when the show went to air this was not censored. i understand that Americans get a lot more censorship than us but i am a little dissapointed that this ""uncut"" DVD was still censored."
2,Futile Justification,"It is very interesting to learn how Russian historians view Cold War. It is well-written and easy to understand.It seems to me, however, that the authors have some nostalgia for 19th century Russian imperialism. While ideology is described as delirium tremens, there is no criticism of Russian expansionism. Even Stalin's expansionism is justified by his concern for security. By denying Soviet Union's ambition and emphasizing economic loss which Russian people had to suffer, the authors are misleading readers to wrong direction."
2,"Great art, if you like cartoonish art only...","All the art on this CD is very ""cartoonish""...great for some things, but most people like a little variety. I spent $10 more and got a different brand's 200,000 images package. There was no comparison...the other brand had photos, fonts, ""classy"" and ""cartoonish"" art - a real selection."
5,A big book that handles a big subject well,"From Pet Behavior Newsletter: At 408 pages, 8 1/2X11, illustrated and with index Hands-On Dog Care is a big book that handles a big subject with lots of illustrations, photos, charts and guides to what to do in the event of every imaginable medical emergency a professional in the dog business or a serious dog owner would need to know. It is split into sections. The first contains 15 chapters, all of which deal with recognizing symptoms for an incredible array of physical ailments and injuries, then applying first aid. The second section holds 25 chapters on how to establish a dog's baseline behavior, provide for regulasr clinical care, fleas and worms, give oral medication, examine eyes, etc. etc, etc. Even advice about getting a proper first-aid kit...It's all there! (whew)"
5,Wonderful Work,"Bob's book has helped me many times to put together presentations. His guidelines are especially helpful when presenters have anxiety about the material and about standing in front of an audience. It's funny and informative. Buy this book!I posted a summary of this book on scribd.com. Scribd featured the summary. I hope that the sales of the books has increased. I have taught Bob's ideas for years. His mother told me about the book years ago. I am glad she did. Thank you, Bob."
3,"Highly Portable, for occasional use, slow as molasses scans",This scanner is to be held to be believed. It is extremely light and small. It is powered through the USB port. I carry it with my laptop whereever I go in case I need to scan something.The downside of lightness is that the scans take an extremely long time. This makes it usesless for scanning multiple pages at a time. It'll drive you nuts if you try.The newer versions of this printer may be faster.I myself will get a larger but faster Epson scanner to carry with me.
5,Go girls!,"*sighs* I love this era. I'd be rhetorical of me to say I don't enjoy listening to these girl groups. Personally, my favourite would be ""Chapel of Love."" As a romantic, this CD just made my day."
3,"Neat, but not really fascinating","For a film that has been rendered entirely on desktop computers (the first of its kind), the result is remarkable; but you will recognize the flaws (e. g., in the moves of the spaceship's probes). The music, although appropriate, could also be better.At least the story's framework has been well chosen: a journey through a remote solar system with eight planets, one of which has very special properties - and many may find the spiritual touch of a ""meeting place of possibilities"" interesting."
5,A must-have dictionary,"For anyone who has no patience for looking up alphbatized words, The Oxford Duden Pictorial is a must. What a wonderful idea to be able to look up a category (the furniture in the living room, the names of sport items.etc) and find them all on one page. These dictionaties aren't being sold in the big chain stores but Amazon lists many. The use of this dictionary is endless."
1,all are on the 50 mega pack and look much better,"just another waste of time and my money,the prints are unwatchable and themovies are on other sets that look better and have better price."
1,Bad disc,Disc number 4 was so damaged I could not view it. Was extremely disappointed. Sounded like the best disc of the set. The rest of the discs were very entertaining
4,GIMME SOME SNAKE SODA,"Great album consisting of 3 of today's most talented musicians. I was a Wooten fan going into the album but my jaw dropped with Henderson's screaming guitar riffs; I have a new found respect for these cats after listening to this album. ""snake soda"" is off the hook and listening to another version of ""giant steps"" is always a treat."
3,Battery life is not great,"I bought this because my phone was losing its charge when I talked for more than 1 - 2 hours. I hoped that a new battery would improve the talk time. I have to say that I am disappointed. While it started out good, after 2 months, I am back to having a talk time of around 1 - 2 hours after which I get the dreaded 'low battery' warning."
4,Great Book on Options,I read this book and must say it gives you a great grounding in options theory. A must read.
5,Hilariously funny!!!,We love this movie. My son asked me to buy it and he's taken it to his friends house to watch it.
4,"A good set of Closed ""Cans""","An update of the venerable Sony's used for on site Films & movies. I find the high end (of which these are supposed to excel at) a little weak, but then it might just be my tired old (Oops, Live Concert Sound Engineer) ears. As a 'field set"" they are very good, and Quite durable given the plastic construction as long as some care is used in handling. Closed 'cans' are Very Different than 'open cans in response, but of course when recording open cans are an invitation to feedback! In the 'field' the Sony's are fine. For mixdown try the AKG A7's, they are quite .expensive but can be found at a discounted price. Good cans are Not cheap!"
2,I wish they still made the original version.,"Like other people have stated the original version(simply titled Sony MDR 7509) was much flatter and accurate than the newer Sony MDR 7509HDs. I don't know why Sony wanted to change the sound to be more for bass heads and artificial sound lovers when it's a professional model.While they may look the same the Sony Sony MDR 7509HDs are pretty much the polar opposite of the origianl Sony MDR 7509s when it comes to sound and not in a good way. The original Sony MDR 7509s sound much more real,detailed,accurate and flat which was perfect for recording. The Sony 7509HDs sound muddy,boomy, muffled and cheap compared to the original model. Since they don't make the original model anymore you're better off saving money by buying the Sony MDR V6s (still the same after all these years) and using the rest of your money for entertainment (cds,dvds,video games). You'll be happier if you do."
1,Pickup cover holes don't line up.,It seems that the pickups on mexican stratocasters and American stratocasters are just a litlle different. I have an American Stratocaster and the pickup cover holes didn't line up. They don't fit over the pickup poles so you end up routing the last one (high E) out with a rat tail file. After putting them on I was very disappointed on how it looked.Salvatore J. Pizza (Bluezician)
5,Early Willie Nelson...,"...but still amazing. Willie never fails to please, and this is proof. If you want just one CD of Willie's early years, you ought to check this one out. It's got all of the really big early hits, with Rhino's enhanced sound.You get some rarities, as the title states. I don't want to ramble, so all I'm going to say is that if you like early Willie, and you want most (if not, all) of his really big early hits, they are all here.Highly recommended for the Willie fan. ENJOY!!!"
2,Doesn't stick very well.,"I like the shape and size, but it just doesn't seem to want to stay stuck for long, no matter what angle I put it at. Pretty, though. And nicely sized."
2,mmm...beefy,"One of my wonderful siblings bought me one of these for Christmas. How he knew that I secretly wanted a large canister of flavored fat for Christmas, I'll never know."
3,CD was scratched,"The CD was scratched, although I enjoyed what I could hear. Also, it is annoying that the DVD does not automatically go to the next song - the viewer must select each song to listen to/watch the music video."
3,"Cute Webkinz, but price is a total Ripoff!!!","Like the title says, the puppy is cute and webkinz is a ton of fun, in fact I give the toy 5 stars. But the price Amazon is chargeing! Total ripoff. I mean, there in the hundreds on ebay, but it's a lot less. I'm savving my money for an ebay one, it may take awhile though. Wish me luck."
3,Baltimore Album instruction,"It's a good DVD - very interesting, but just not exactly what I thought it was going to be. I thought it would be more on technique and not so much on emblellishments. Overall it is a good DVD."
4,Good book,Not a bad Star Trek Book. I would have liked to have seen it develop the plot better in another direction. It had the possibility of being awesome. Too much focus on a love triangle. Would have better focus on the alien artifact. Have to read to find out...
3,Complete,"I can verify that this is the Complete Season 3 of Rugrats, 26 episodes (one of which, Passover, is double-length) and comes on 6 discs.Normally I would reccomend any of Amazon's MOD releases of Nicktoons (Rugrats most emphatically of all), but this is a reasonably good deal for the amount of content.So, 39 of the 65 original episodes of Rugrats are officially available on DVD... all that remains of this early period is the second half of Season 2, which Amazon has inexplicably seen fit to skip over. An issue of these episodes, on their own or as a reissue of the existing Season 2 set, is in order."
2,Disappointing,"Knowing that Alan Grant is a veteran comic book writer, the book was rather disappointing. Perhaps if you don't follow any of the JLA or Batman comics, you might enjoy the book more than I did. But, if you do regularly read JLA or Batman, then I think you will find that the book has a rather weak plot, cliché character dialog, and is a re-hash of earlier comic book themes, etc.There was nothing new, nothing interesting. It portrayed the JLA as a bunch on morons except for Batman. The novel insinuated that when a telepathic link that exists between team members is broken, the various team members don't know what to do (except for Batman because he is used to working alone). Didn't all the JLA members work alone for years before joining the JLA?It is like Mr. Grant had a contract to write a book so he just threw one together to meet the obligation."
2,This is a primer; a supplement to a Taxco library,The authors wrote this before the move to collect became as advanced as at present. There photos are b & w and they are plentiful for this reprint - i have not seen the original; and the text is short and to the point about a few artists. The preamble about Mexican silver antedating the Taxco movment is enlightening and very nicely done. Once can never have enough photos to have an appreciation and this little book adds to one's library of Taller and Taxco and is most welcome even if not a giant or in color.
3,History of Mexican Jewelry,"This is a great book if you're looking to read up on the history of Mexican jewelry. But if you're looking for photos of Mexican jewelry or their markings, this is not the book you're looking for."
1,No wonder they hate us...,"US to world: hey world, your starving? Well look at us! We're gluttonous fools! See how we waste food and oil? Aren't we a great and responsible nation?Jerks..."
2,This inner tube is definitely popped!!!,"It's Toobin' on the GBC, but was it good? Not really. The concept was the same, tube down a river, try NOT to pop your inner tube, same deal, but the graphics were not as good. At least the music was spot on. but I really didn't care much for the gameplay. Anyway, if you want Toobin' get the Midway Arcade Treasures, but, don't look here."
3,A bit overated,"Honestly, I would not have bought this now having seen it. The film has it's moments but overall I think it's a very overrated film. It has a cute story line, but it's very simple. Simple story lines are fine, but they need the characters to stand out, but they we're only average. I found the dialogue to be rather poor in most places, and completely lacking in others. Of course I don't know spanish, so maybe some meaning was lost in the subtitles, but that can't account for everything. Sometimes you couldn't tell if a character looked awkward because of the situation or because the actor didn't know what to do for that scene. Another major problem was the editing. There was so much that could have been taken out of that film. So many scenes of complete silence. I think the film was somewhere around an hour and 40 minutes. It could easily have been an hour."
2,Subtitles,I read all the reviews and searched through many movies and decided this is the one I wanted to watch. No where did I see the word subtitles....but it sure is. If you dont mind them go for it...had I known I would have moved on. I hate ready everyword....
4,Intriguing...,This movie isn't for the average American. There's not much of the frenetic energy that Americans expect in movies. It encourages you to sit still and watch and absorb. The chemistry between the two male leads moves the movie forward and makes it possible to believe this sort of scenario could actually happen. I'd recommend it to those who are open to something different.
4,A Scientist Who Knows How to Write!,"Although this book is old, I mean pre-1988 (when the carbon-dating of the Shroud took place), I think this book should still be required reading for those interested in the Shroud of Turin. Heller does a vivid job of telling how the STURP (Shroud of Turin Project, Inc.) team came into existence, and a detailed account of their examination of the Shroud in 1978. I came to this book with a negative view of the STURP team, gleaned from other books on the Shroud. But Heller shows what a tremendous job they did under unusual and often trying circumstances. Heller is a blood expert and after reading about his hundreds of tests, it makes one wonder why anyone would doubt that there is blood on the Shroud (as opposed to some sort of paint)."
5,An excellent canine travel bed.,This bed is so very comfortable for the dogs. It washes up extremely well. It is a good size for different sized dogs. I use it at home and for travel. An all around great bed for my dogs!
1,DO NOT GET,IF YOU LOVE OR EVEN LIKE THE WALKING DEAD TV SHOW...THIS DVD PUTS IT TO SHAME. PURCHASED THINKING IT WOULD BE SIMILAR...NOT EVEN CLOSE. WOULD SERIOUSLY TRASH IT...NO GOOD MOVIE.
2,Average,"The whole movie has good concept, just lacks that hollywood A rating actor, along with better makup artist.If i could watch this on redbox on a saturday.The whole movie dragged a bit.bottom line if you nothing better to watch, this wasn't half bad."
2,NO STRINGS ATTACHED,"This mophead worked beautifully the first time, but, regrettably, that was the only time. With the second use the strings started to come off.In addition, even before it began to bald the strings clung together so when wet that it only went over a small surface area. Thus, we found ourselves having to do twice as many strokes to try to wash the same kitchen floor."
4,Ethics for Dummies!,"I purcahsed this book and its sister book (The Right Thing To Do) for my Ethics course in college, by far this book is more helpful than the other text, as it takes the ethical theories and dilemas and relates them to real world cases and provides explanations as to the reasons why something is so much better than the sister book does. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever struggled in a Philosophy course. It is much easier to read and comprehend than the sister text and more aptly applies the theories to the real world in which we live, thereby making ethics a lot more eaier to understand and recognize."
4,Interesting historical novel,"A very interesting historical novel had the invasion of the Kanto plain (Operation Coronet) taken place. The presupposition is that the Trinity atomic bomb test didn't go off as planned (think deus ex machina) and President Truman orders the invasion of Kyushu (Operation Olympic) and then Honshu. This is historical fiction, keep that in mind. If another reputable book is taken into account (The Invasion of Japan-Skates), the Japanese have way too many forces available for the defense of Honshu (Tokyo). Still, despite the irrevelevant romantic entanglement of one of the main characters, a very interesting look at one of the great 'What ifs' in modern military history."
2,Worked well for a while,"I got the ABI breathalyzer a couple of months ago and was very fond of it at first. Ok, the beeping is annoying, but it seemed to provide precise readings, which were interesting especially the day after....However, the unit got progressively decalibrated, with readings now about twice as high as they should be, and there is no way to calibrate it on your own. I will try another brand next time."
3,Maybe it's just not enough escapism for me.,"I found L'Amber to be interesting, but not captivating, but in all honesty it could simply be because it wasn't a Fantasy or Horror story. If anything, it felt more like Magritte's Secret Agent than Delirium's Mistress or Sabella or even Dark Dance.Still, I would buy it anyway simply because I buy whatever I can of Tanith Lee's writings."
1,...Mmmmmmmmm...What a JOKE...,Who thought this was a good idea?? Who would buy this?! I think I have wasted enough time and energy on this review...
4,Comprehensive overview of Ireland,"I had seen this DVD from Netflix, and then bought it for friends, all of us who are planning to visit Ireland. Of a number of DVDs I have seen on Ireland, I find this the most comprehensive -- nice photography, good information. Of course, it still doesn't cover everything."
3,video of Ireland,Helpful in preparing for a trip to Island. Helped visualize many of areas to be visited.
1,one sided,This book is completely biased. It speaks on all the negative aspects of the Koran and only the good aspects in the Bible. If I am to read a book to learn about the two religions side by side I need an unbiased author and not someone whose main goal it seems from this book is to completely make the whole Islamic religion look bad. I am very disappointed and regret purchasing this book for my Kindle.
2,Biased: not what it claims to be!,"I couldn't believe the words in the ""editorial review"" above! As A politically conservative Christian I say this book is NOT an unbiased examination of the similarities and differences in the Holy Bible and the Qur'an. First, there is a photo of Usama bin Laden on the cover; how does that shade the views about Islam in this book? Second, Muhammed is branded a terrorist instead of as a warrior; there is a difference between war and terrorism! Third, the book uses the old word ""Koran"" instead of the newer, more respectful ""Qur'an."" This book looks to be only for Fundamentalist ""Christians"" who want justification to believe untruths and half-truths about Islam. A better book, if you would read it with an open mind is ""Islam Denounces Terrorism""by Harun Yahya. That book shows you thjat what is goig on in the world with terrorists who claim to be following Islam is based on politics, not on faith in Allah and adherance to the Qur'an."
3,Susan Elizabeth Phillips she is not!,This story is too slow moving for me. I had a hard time concentrating as I would drift off thinking of something else. Not enough excitement and no sparks!
4,Only one problem,"In order to turn this light on and off, you have to twist the head -- there is no on/off switch. Other than that, it's an excellent product.The light shown is the smallest of three that Victorinox manufactures. The others are a 2-AA version and a 2-C cell version. (the Herrington Catalogue sells all three). All use the latest high-intensity LEDs, have a range well in excess of comparable flashlights with normal bulbs, and unlike many LED lights, have a focused beam.These are great products, except for the lack of a switch."
2,Not worth the price,"This flashlight is not worth the price! After about a month of using it only about twenty minutes at night, the batteries went completely dead. Before that, they began to go out and I had to shake the flashlight to get them to come back on. If it were not for the size, I would give this flashlight a minus star!"
1,Easily THE worst book I've read all year,"For someone looking for an interesting plot, character development, great dialogue, clever plot twists, quality of writing that seems beyond a high school level - this is NOT the book for you. I've read books by Lynda LaPlante before, and never thought they were that bad, which is the only reason I even bothered to finish this one - I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. It actually seemed to get worse as it went along. This was just a really BAD book. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,Happy With Purchase,I bought this for my 9yr old daughter and she was happy with it and thats all that matters to me.
5,Best book I ever read,"This book shall remain in my library permanently. Do not mistake this as simply an ""Anne Frank"" copycat; it is not! Nor is this just another Nazi story. What make this book so incredible is her comments about life and loneliness. Interestingly, there is also laugh-aloud humor sprinkled throughout. The end of the book, unlike Wiesel et al., leaves one feeling upbeat. It is a remarkable, true account, written by a successful NYC psychiatrist on her deathbed due to breast cancer and published posthumously. THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE MISSED!"
2,"Not sure if mine was defective, or if item is simply subpar","I purchased this reconditioned item primarily to toast English Muffins, which I eat regularly. Strangely, I had to set it all the way up to its darkest setting (9) just to get the muffin to be somewhat browned. I would routinely have to toast more than once to get the desired level of toasting.I suspect there was something wrong with mine, but who knows? I returned my KitchenAid and ordered a Krups toaster...I am hoping for better results."
1,BEWARE! Not hyperlinked.,BEWARE! The blue highlighted text in the preview are NOT hyperlinks to the chapters. So there is no way to navigate in the book. I feel whoever put this up is quite deceptive by color-coding the table of contents.
1,MONSTER MASH AND OTHER LOVE SONGS,"I love the song called Monster Mash very, very much. The Six Flags St. Louis Plymouth Palace Theatre in the musical play called Love at First Fright put the song Monster Mash in it! I have always been loving this song since I used to listened to the Oldies KLOU 103.3 FM and you can find lots of Halloween songs on Halloween day on that station, too."
5,great photos,very interesting photos that I had never seen before. too many books on this family are filled with all the same photos. Nice to see some new ones.
5,Beautiful music,"Fantastic music and a wonderful film by the way. I had this CD and lost it and now for some reason, it is hard to find. Why is that? If anyone is listening, bring it back!"
4,A complement to Practical Watch Repairing,"I don't agree with the last review. This book has to be viewed as a complement, a second volume, to Practical Watch Repairing of the same author. You have to read the first book to fully understand it. If you look at this book as a second volume of the classic Practical Watch Repairing, it deserves 4 stars. It does not cover new automatic movements from the 70s and 80s, but every automatic system used by the industry is documented. Well, if you can repair an ETA or Omega from the 50s or 60s, you can repair a movement from the 80s and 90s. That's my point of view."
5,"Awesome condition, arrived quickly!","I ordered this item on Sept. 2nd, with a promised arrival date of between Sept. 10-27. It arrived way ahead of schedule, Sept.9, to be exact. And in way better condition than I could have imagined! Such a great value all the way around! Buying from this seller was like hitting a home-run!!!"
3,Doesn't fit my turtle.,"I bought this because the large version was a little snug for my 5"" box turtle. The XL takes up more floor space but the interior is actually SMALLER than the large. It's much thicker so she can't fit into it at all. I've added ""feet"" to it to raise it up but I'm not happy."
5,The BEST laundry detergent,Persil is the best product for your laundry that is out there. Eventhough it is more expensive..it is worth every penny. Also there is a water softener in the detergent as well. For those who have hard water..that is a extra benefit. You get what you pay for. This is the mercedes of laundry detergent.
2,"great quality, bad fit","These shoes come with their own storage pouch, they have leather soles with rubber no-skid island in the middle, they look pretty sitting in the box...In short, before trying them on, they are the perfect pair for the price.But, they are just a tad shorter for the listed size (the heels hang out from the back just a few centimeters) and the band is a little too loose both for comfort and the look (the toe goes a little too far forward). But the length of the shoe is short even with toe going all the way forward. For most other shoes, my feet are very true to the regular size I wear.No matter how good the shoe looks off the feet, it is not worth anything if the fit is not right. Very disappointed."
3,Good but Dated,"This is a great book for its time but the information is 10 years old. Ten years is a long time by cyberstandards. For more up-to-date Cyberlaw, check out Internet Laws Affecting Your Company, by IP attorney Brett Trout. Although not as comprehensive, it was written in 2005. I found it very useful."
1,be careful!,"another reviewer mentioned receiving used equipment. I, too, received a used product - scuffs on the spyder and opened software box. unfortunately, my product was broken as well.the product may be good in theory, but then, it would need to work for me to comment on that particular facet.you may want to consider other alternatives."
5,Cool!,"This is a fascinating book with lots of cool illustrations and diagrams. If you have kids, or still are one, buy this book. It's really neat."
4,Good Find,I looked all over for the 1965 edition of Aglow With the Spirit by Dr. Robert C. Frost and found it on amazon.com. It was a bit slow arriving but in pretty good condition considering it was used.
4,An Early Women's Rights Fighter,Molly Pitcher lived around the time of the Revolutionary War and she wanted to do the things the boys and men in her family did. She was smart but she couldn't go to school because she was a girl. She was brave and did things to help her family. She gave water to the soldiers and they called her Molly Pitcher because they wanted her to bring them the pitcher of water. When she was an adult she foughtbesude her husband in the war and took over firing the canon when he couldn't. She won an award from General George Washington and was made an honorary soldier. This book gives good examples of what life was like when people had to pay taxes to England and it shows how the war started.
5,An absorbing story of an examined life,"Anne has been a housewife for decades: now she's an author and talk show host handling social issues and an ongoing concern over a long-missing daughter. She's drawn to girls who may have been her daughter, to a married man who has helped her search, and to a life and world filled with complicated choices. An absorbing story of an examined life."
3,eye opening,"and now that a movie is out on the same topic, perhaps the book gains more interest. if you have a heart, you should stop buying diamonds, read this book and then see if you still desire them ... if so, at least you'll know which ones you should buy."
3,Fit the bill,"The dolphin is fine and good addition to the animals my daughter is collecting and plays with. I've seen better quality in other higher end animals, but this is fine for play."
5,Brilliant story,"I have come 10 years late to this genre, I never knew it existed but now I am hooked. Beverly Jenkins provide historial information, suspense, romance and a good story you never want her books to end. I look forward to reading all of them. Beg, buy , borrow of steal (well not steal) to read her books if you have to."
5,"This is great, but buy the albums instead","I will skip the babbling about how great The Kinks are. Here is the order in which I recommend buying their albums:1. Something Else By The Kinks (5 stars)2. Face to Face (5 stars)3. Village Green Preservation Society (5 stars)4. Arthur... (5 stars)5. Lola Versus Powerman & The Moneygoround (4.5 stars)6. Misfits (4 stars)7. Muswell Hillbillies (4 stars)The first five are masterpieces. ""Something Else"" and ""Village Green"" are cohesive ensemble pieces; ""Face to Face"" is a fabulous collection of songs. Note that this is not a ranking; this is just the order in which I recommend buying these gems."
4,Not for determined chewers,The Chuckit is a great design and flys well. Only problem is a very determined puggle chewed through the rubber feet and his pitbull sister was able to pull out the plastic rods that support the sides. So I would only recommend this toy for dogs who enjoy fetching frisbees and not for those who like to chew a lot.
5,"Great, durable dog toy","My dog has a ton of energy and loves to fetch. I bought this figuring it could keep him entertained for hours. The first time I threw it (it's thrown- and flies- exactly like a frisbee), he bolted off after it. After a few days, he started leaping to catch it mid-air, and now he's absolutely hooked. It also helps that the flying squirrel is very well-made, because my dog loves to chew and destroy his toys. This one has held up remarkably well, and I highly recommend it."
3,Normal dogs will love this,My weird dog just wants to chew it up. She much prefers her tennis ball...flies really well - I can see how a frizbee loving dog with LOVE this - nice rubber corners - would be less wear and tear on dogs gums/teeth.
5,This thing is awesome!,"This thing is great. I have a fox terrier, and she can work! If you launch this holding the head rather than a paw, it will go quite far, without much wear on your arm. It hovers well, and you can easily whip it right along the ground and it will curve around gently...as far as my dog is concerned it might as well be a rabbit. It also bounces surprisingly well on grass. That's right, on grass. Bounce tosses thrill my dog particularly and as it cuts up she pounces after it.However, what most impresses me about the squirrel is it's durability. Frisbees of any kind are too soft to stand up to more than an hour or so. The act of holding the frisbee in her mouth a hundred times simply destoys it. The squirrel is incredibly tough, and flies great after thousands of fetches."
3,Not Tough Enough,This one lasted about a month before she had a large hole chewed right thru the center of it.
4,Our third squirrel,"Our dogs love this toy -- because it is not absolutely flat it is easier for them to pick it up and it is a great toy for tug of war. Every now and then you'll get one that won't fly terribly straight, but overall it is sturdy, easy to spot if it travels farther than usual, and it works better than classic plastic frisbees."
2,too big,"The item was listed as size medium and was bigger than the one I had previously. The quality of the product is fine, but the sizes are hard too determine."
1,Silly Liberal Tripe,This movie bordered on insanity.After watching this piece of crap for almost two hours and to discover the secret source is a little girl is lunacy. I did not know whether to laugh or get mad. I did both. The good news is that I only spent two dollars at a pawn shop.The bad news is that some other unsuspecting individual will pay two dollars for the misleading title of this foolish drivel of a film.
4,Worth Watching!!!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was pretty good. I had never even heard of it. Story line was very interesting. Ending was not what I expected, had some good twists.Definitely worth watching!!!"
4,Interesting Thriller,Many interesting twists and turns that capture the audience. Based on a true story that reveals to what extremes the government will climb to protect its interests to the point of stripping freedom from its people.
2,Dull,This is basically a fictional story based on the Valerie Plame scandal. I thought it would be much better than it was. I am a fan of Matt Dillion but he didn't show me much in this movie except to adopt a fake southern accent later to drop it and have it reappear. Alan Alda is brought in as a famous powerful attorney but then does very little at all. Kate Beckinsdale is just blah and I didn't find her acting to be anything special at all. Vera Farminga was the one stand out as the Valerie Plame type character.I just found the movie to be kind of dull and thought it could have been much better. I think the casting was just off.
4,Good but a size too big,Our Aussi is about 45 lbs and we didn't realize how big this flying squirrel is although it says it -- will order the medium next time.
4,Great but not spectular!,"I think the new music from WWF is great but break the wall down is great but it would have been greater if it had the countdown and that would have made it greater. If you know your role and get this CD, you will past the test and will be over the edge."
5,Great CD? OH HELL YEAH!!!!,"This CD is a HOG!!! The WWF music series has always put out good music, but they have really outdone themselves this time. This CD, unlike the ones before, is not just some catchy riffs and sound bytes. Instead, this could be classified as actual music, with the majority of the songs having their own lyrics. The best of them are ""Break the Wall Down"", ""No Chance in Hell"", ""This is a Test"", ""Know your Role"", and, my personal favorite ""My Time"". Stay away from ""Oh Hell Yeah""(why didn't he just stay with his old theme?),""Big"" and ""Sexual Chocolate"". Also, don't buy the upcoming WCW Mayhem CD. It is a total copy of the WWF(what hasn't WCW take from the WWF?!?), and the themes aren't that good to begin with. If you like this kind of music, I would recommend Korn, Kid Rock, Orgy, ICP and LIMP BIZKIT!!!"
4,Awesome CD,"That is a good CD, good for wrestling Fans in the entire world, buy it. Track 1: Really good Track 2: Excellent Track 3: Not bad Track 4: Really S U C K S! Track 5: Excellent Track 6: Not bad Track 7: Good Track 8: D'Lo and his music absolutelly SUCKS! Track 9: Not Bad Track 10: Excellent Track 11: It's best the Vol. 3 version Track 12: It;s perfect Track 13: Sucks Track 14: Not bad"
2,WWF Volume 4 review,"This Cd is actually pretty good. Here is a rating that I give for each track.1. Chris Jericho - OK track, I never listen to it on my CD2. The Big Show - OK theme3. The Corporation - Ok theme, the shortest one on the track4. Mark Henry - Good beat & cool track5. Test - Good theme6. Mankind - Boring in my opinion7. Stone Cold Steve Austin - A really good theme8. D'Lo Brown - Nice theme & good beat9. Christian - Great theme10. Mr. Ass - Ok theme. I never listen to it though11. Undertaker - One of his best12. Triple H/Chyna - Good lyrics & good beat13. Edge - Good theme14. The Rock - Boring"
1,thi is a disgrace,"i have heard better music come out of a whinning dogs mouth than on this cd. the wwf should take this off of the department stores shelves. it really, S U C K S!"
1,What is this?,"I haven't heard the CD yet. But how good could it be, it's a bunch of wrestling themes. Anyone who would ever spend 15 dollars to buy this CD needs something better to spend their money on. Wrestling is ok to watch, but spending your money so you can get a woody by hearing the Rock's voice, Come on......."
4,Not bad,"I'm not a huge fan of wrestling and I don't watch it that much, but I had heard that this was a good cd so I listened to it one day. It was actually pretty good overall. I wasn't crazy about the first 4 songs, but starting with Test's song, this cd really picks up and turns out to be not bad at all. My favorites are ""Know Your Role"" by The Rock and Mankind's ""Wreck."" Most of them have a good beat to them and ""Assman"" is hilarious.This is a good cd with some catchy music and if you're a major wrestling fan, you will probably like it even more than i did. I recommend it to anybody who likes wrestling."
4,Greatest Hits?,"I can't really say I've gotten all the way through the album. After track eight I usually get bored and do something else.(Yay for ADD!) Anyway heres the review.The Lost Souls-4/5 Good songThe Days Of The Pheonix-4/5 I love the ""everyone was dancing"" partA Winter's Tale-5/5 I think it was unreleasedTotalimmortal-3/5 catchy chorus.Fall Children-2/5 WEAK!!!The Prayer Position-4/5 GREAT SONG!!!God Called In Sick Today-5/5 great chorus and the greatest title ever.Lower It-2/5 don't like itA Single Second-4/5 if you ask me it sounds like The OffspringThird Season-3/5He Who Laughs Last-3/5I Wanna Get A Mohawk-4/5 Just cause my girl likes itPerfect Fit-3/5Rolling Balls-5/5 It made me laughWho Said You Could Touch Me?-3/5"
4,Nice Package,"I have always been a John Wayne fan. I purchased this three movie, two disk set and was very pleased to find high end packaging guaranteeing the disks will be protected well into the future. Most importantly, the movies themselves were of a high quality. These three movies look as though they were just made. The color and dialoge were clear and concise. Well done."
4,He's still the man!,Great collection. Good quality pictures. Wayne and Hepburn what a winning combination in Rooster Cogburn.
4,"Some minor issues with suction function, but overall great!","We just needed a safe place to put our rings when washing dishes in the kitchen or hand washing clothes in the bathroom sink. I got two - a black one and a white one. The black one (in our kitchen on tile) seems to have no problem sticking. The white one (on our bathroom counter) can't seem to maintain it's suction.Still it's a pretty handy product and I feel safer knowing that if the thing were to fall off the counter, our rings would be held onto it (the magnet piece works well) and it wouldn't shatter."
2,Waste of money!,"I gave it two stars only because is was so inexpensive. It falls often, it's fogs up and now I can barely see myself in the mirror. It's useless, cheap and for me a waste of money. Going to spend more money to see if I can get something better."
3,Adequate for Price,The fog free mirror is adequate for what you pay for. The mirror is not 100% fog free but it has worked well for me so far.
2,"Technically, it is a mirror, but...","This thing is useless. I mean, technically, it's a mirror, but...The mirror itself is pretty solid. It's not of the greatest fidelity and water seems to sit on it rather than run down. The anti-fog stuff works as advertised.Unfortunately, that's about all the good I have to say about this thing. ""Wall mountable"" is a bit of a misnomer. As far as in shower use, don't bother. The suction cup doesn't stick to much of anything. I tried tile, fiberglass, wood, laminate...when it did manage to stick, any faint disturbance of any kind (even looking at it funny, it seems)would cause it crashing to the floor. The only successful surface was my big vanity mirror, which seems a bit superfluous. I don't really need a shaving mirror on my vanity mirror."
3,"Good Stills, Ok Video","This camera is good for the middle of the road. It does both video and stills, but doesn't do either great. The stills are good, but not forgiving at all with motion. You must hold the camera still. I find using the stand as much as possible works best. In daylight, camera works well. Video is a mixed bag. Camera claims 30 fps at 240 x 180, but in every one of my test with voice quality audio the picture really stutters. 15 fps is the closet I have gotten to good quality and for get about trying at 640 x 480. If you are looking for better video there are better cameras out there, but as a hybrid it works just fine."
1,"Camera is okay, but the software is bad","I experienced multiple system errors when attempting to download images from the camera to the computer. This software glitch effectively renders the camera useless. I contacted Intel technical support regarding this, but they were not responsive. I will definately stay away from Intel cameras in the future."
2,A Disapointment,This book is not for people looking for serious wholesaling.All this information can be found by doing a search on the internet. I found very few true wholesalers. I have been able to find much better pricings at alternate sites. Find a different book to buy if you're truly looking for real wholesale companies.
4,"Is it normal for flash drives to ""bend"" a little?","When the cover is off, the part that actually goes into the usb port (the metal part) wiggles a little. It can bend a little from side to side. Is that ok and perfectly normal, or no? I would appreciate anyone that could reply so that I know if it's defective or not. Otherwise, it works great. Very fast."
1,Absolutely Dreadful,"Yes, it offers a glimpse of the power of fiction and its impact on readers. Unfortunately, it is unreadable, and for the most part,tedious. This will undoubtedly be one of those books that professors assign to fiction writing students. Let's hope they learn a few things about how not to write a novel."
1,awful,This book is stupid. The idea of the book is okay but the acutal text is horrid. Its a long boring book i wouldnt want anyone to read.
3,A Broker and a Professor produce a Mixed bag,"This slim green book is a study guide, yet it offers real world examples, chapters on simple option strategies and presents its ideas in clear, short chapters. It is still options 101, not hype 101 (for that entertaining course, see Wade Cook's Wall St. Money Machine).But the low cost book will serve you as well as Natenber's big green bible on Option Volatility, or Kolb's thick black finance course called Understanding Options."
2,"Very funny, but not worth the cost","Mel Brooks is hilarious, but the cost is much too high for this package."
4,Fun!,"We enjoyed this, and you may, too if you're a fan of these two classic comedians. The schtick can be a little repetitive in places, but if you like to laugh in your car as you drive along, this is great. The DVD was not as effective as the CDs."
2,"Philips 26"" LCD flat screen","I'm quite pleased with my purchase. I've got 3 other Philips flat screen televisions--all of which have been great. They are easy to program, have great picture and sound quality."
2,Under-it-all shoudl hide under a rock,"Ordered this product a while ago after searching local stores. No one carries it anymore or the actual makeup. I thought if I used this product under my regular make-up, it would produce results. It left streaks that showed through. Well, it is still sitting in the drawer of used items I will never use again! It did almost nothing. The people that suggested using that vagi lubricant were on the right track! If it wasn't for the medicinal odor, I would use that instead! This was a a waste of money."
3,DON'T PAY THE FERRYMAN,"I'm surprised more horror movies haven't tapped into the legendary Ferryman story. This one doesn't take place on the river Styx but in the Pacific.THE FERRYMAN is heavy on atmospheric mysticism and has a few disturbing scenes, and for a film of its genre, it's decent enough. The story focuses on some kind of spirit that has eluded the Ferryman for years by using a magic knife that allows him to jump from body to body. SLIDERS and INDIANA JONES' John Rhys Davies plays the first spirit who then manages to take over six more bodies from three couples on a cruise to Fiji. I also wish they would have used Chris DeBurgh's original DON'T PAY THE FERRYMAN instead of the horrible remake. But it's a decent horror film for fans."
3,Scaffold is ok,I don't know what I expected when I ordered this but it is not as I expected. I can use it for some painting jobs but I wanted something more.
4,Alright,These disks do an alright job with the odor. But cleaning the can weekly with some bleach will definetly help!!!!!
2,They are okay,"I received an envelope with three small disks in it just as another reviewer did. There was nothing else in the envelope just the three disks. I was also surprised how lacking they were, they really do look like the free disks you get from some places. However, the smell is good but I am not sure how they will work in the nursery for our daughters diaper pail since she is not here yet. They are not very strong so I hope they will be able to mask the odor from her diapers. I am glad they were so inexpensive so I don't really feel like I wasted much money if they don't work."
3,Not so great,These diaper pail deodorizers are too pungent. They replace the diaper smell with a sweetish but unpleasant scent. I wouldn't buy them again.
3,Short but interesting,"I bought this book in order to read the piece by Sayyid Qutb, who is considered the intellectual father of Al-Qaeda. Although his observations on America were naive, they are not completely without merit and often display valuable insights. Other pieces range from discussions that are carefully reasoned and balanced to those that are outright attacks. Others are comic and satirical. Really, reading this book left me wanting more of these sort of articles to read. If only this book had been longer! Many of the articles were too short, probably because the translators did not want to spend their time translating more articles."
4,4 Inches!?,"I should have read the title better...these are zip ties for ANTS!Very small although probably great for cables, they do not work for what I need."
4,Does What They Are Supposed To,"They are just right for tying three or four electronic cables together. They hold well, and do what they're designed to do. Fast shipment from third party seller."
5,good cable ties,"I threw these in my cart to get my total high enough to qualify for free shipping.They are regular old zip ties, good quality and will be good to have around the house."
1,Brittle. Most broke.,Very brittle. Most of the ties broke when I tried to use them. Not worth it to try to return them.
1,utterly worthless,"The little ratchets of half the ties broke as I tightened them, letting the ties slip right off. The ties themselves snapped very easily. Friends, don't waste your money. Get some good cable ties or learn to tie knots in string."
3,Unable to find examples source code,"I just got this book about 2 weeks ago. I followed the link in the book where it said that I could download the examples code. I found the book, but not the examples code. Without the example code, I can not really follow the book. Can someone send me the link to the examples source code in the book or post the link on this review."
4,Wonderful Reading!,I enjoyed this book so much! The relationship between mother and daughters reminds me of my own personal interactions with my own daughters at times! It all seemed so real.The sisters behaved just like some sisters do.....the way everything was eventually brought out in the open and the mother's coming to terms with her past was beautifully written.This is a Great read! I recommend it.
5,Awesome family story,"I'm not done reading this yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying Della and her girls. She's kind of pissing me off with her control issues and not even giving Celeste and Ronnie a chance to talk or reveal their feelings. Yes, I understand why but it's irritating.Thumbs up to the Donna & Virginia for writing a novel that can bring some issues home for some readers as we all go through similar things at one time or another. I know this rings true for those mothers who have daughters in their teens or early 20's, 30's...can't wait for the next book!!!"
5,GOOD READING,"My girls have done it again. I love the way these two write. Their stories really hit home. I must say that ""Tryin' To Sleep In The Bed You Made"" is still my favorite, but this is close behind. The story of how Celeste and Ronnie come together as sisters is so heart warming. Family is so important and this book brings this out. Anyone interested in family and family secrets will be very interested in reading this book. I can't wait for their next one."
4,You can relate,"Just finished this book last night; very entertaining. When I read, I envision the scene; I could see the characters and the house at Lily Pond; I would recommend this one. I feel as if I just visited down south and I'd like to go back; maybe to Lester's new condos he's going to build!"
5,great product!,loved this product. it was soft and creamy and the container was not broken. It also arrived in a timely matter.
5,THE BEST,OMG I FREAKING LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!! IT HAS A MILLION AND ONE USES AND WELL PRICED FOR IT'S MANY USES:)
4,"Love it, but hate it at the same time","I bought the shea butter to put on my early forming stretch marks. It is very moisturizing and makes your skin soft but it leaves you feeling very greasy. It's also quite hard to get out of the tub. You have to put it in the microwave for it to soften up and I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't want to go to the microwave every time I want to put lotion on. Overall, I recommend this product but beware of the things you get along with it."
1,not worh it,"I tried the shea butter and it was hard to put on, is very greasy feeling, and did nothing but break my face out. I used it on my hands also, and nothing. No softness, just greasy feeling. Did not like at all. I have 2 cartons that I will throw away."
3,Good but strange texture,"I've previously purchased a more expensive brand of Shea butter, but thought I would try this brand to save money. Now I know why I paid a little more. The texture of this Shea butter is mealy--which took me off guard. Once I ""massaged"" it in my hands a while, it took on a more familiar texture. I'm still deciding if the cost savings is worth the unfamiliar texture."
2,"very yellow, not nutty smell, misleading headline","this is either very refine or not real shea butter. I'm not sure.headline and description says raw unrefined but doesn't look or smell like it. feels pretty gritty but not too bad if you use tiny amounts at a time warm it in your hand. then it can feel soft, though I intended it for my hair I'm not sure if I'll be doing that now. shame i cant directly upload pictures in the review but I will update with some links when I can"
1,BEWARE of this product,"I purchased this product for myself and my mother. When the product was received it was shipped in a box with no accompanying packing slip and no labels on the product. I found this very strange. I have never ordered a product without a label telling you what the item was or what the uses would be. I contacted the company to return it and they accepted the return, however I had to pay for return shipping which was about 1/3 of the cost of the order. However, I had no choice but to send it back because after my mom saw it she said the shea butter was lighter than the shea butter she had and it just didn't look right. Unfortunately I will not be purchasing any more shea butter from this supplier."
1,upset,"I was excited to purchase this product after reading all the great reviews, will not be buying this again. Made things worse than before the use."
3,Defective copy,"Several pages had pictures of objects without any Japanese words for them. But it was inexpensive, and I guess it will do."
3,"For businesses, not for injured workers. For that you need look elsewhere","This book is aimed at businesses. For the injured worker, the best guide out there isHow to Win a Worker's Compensation Claim in Illinois. Even if you don't live in Illinois, this layman's guide gives you a very good overview of the Workers' Compensation system."
2,Not impressed,"I know this was written forever ago and I like the olde english style with which it is written, but it doesn't blow my skirt up - as it were.It lacks insight, which is part of why it is called the cloud of unknowing - I understand that. But when compared to the Ladder of Divine Ascent, it pales in comparison."
4,"Nice, quiet cables (but the jacket snags a little).","Pros:- These are a great cable in that the shielding is very good, and incurs no noise.- Hosa is thorough enough to include a small velcro wrap to keep the cable nicely coiled when not in use (very thoughful).- Finally, it is very attractive, and matches my vintage tweed tube amp quite nicely.Cons:- The jacket itself is fabric, so the wrong side of velcro (like the included velcro wrap) will cause it to fray a bit. It is not a coated tweed jacket like some of the pricier cables. Simply use a little care, though and it'll be fine.-The connectors are very solid, but because the connector housing is screw on, they can come unscrewed. If this is a problem, a little lock-tite on the threads will prevent this.Overall:For the money, these cables sound great, and (with a little care) will continue to look very nice. I've purchased this and the right angle version, and both are similarly solid."
5,Incredible Sound,This is truly the finest instrument cord at a wonderful price. I never knew I could sound so good!
4,Awesome,Incredible views of our planet from the vantage of outer space. This book is jam-packed with beautiful and awe-inspiring photographs revealing Earth in ways you do not ordinarily imagine. It shifts your everyday paradigms of the world you live on.
5,Excellent,"Great word processor, really amazing, can do 1000 more things than Microsoft's word.Keynote is great program and the simplicity to use it alone or with other programs like iPhoto is great."
1,Not worth the $$$,"If it were $4.95 or $9.95, fine, but $20 for the ""shop talk"" video? Not worth it. Dont get me wrong, both Bob and Wayne are great to listen to, but I really didn't get that much out of the video."
4,Easier to remove than traditional chainring bolts,"Use a torque wrench, I have stripped and cracked these chainring bolts before. I did not have any problems with the torque set at 11nm. Much easier to remove than the older style bolts. Use some care when tightening."
1,Soft Bolts,"If you torque these chainring bolts to FSA's spec (12 nm) or even Zinn's spec (11 nm), they will strip before you get to the specified torque. They're just too soft."
2,Total Bunk,"This book was one man's trip on how much the orcas adored him. He presented no scientific evidence to his claims, and thinks the orcas talk to him and he talks to them.It was completely ludricrous.The only reason I gave it two stars was because I liked some of the photographs."
1,Photo misrepresented item,I ordered the boat seat cushions and they were nothing likethe ones pictured. Very thin and poorly made. I have returnedthem for a refund after waiting two weeks for aproval to makethe return and to recieve a mailing lable.
4,does the job.,Does what it's supposed to do. The only thing I don't like about it is dust and lint stick to the silicone.
2,too bulky,"This seemed like a good idea, but the glove is a bit heavy and definitely too bulky to be efficient. I find myself using kitchen towels instead. I'll have to replace this."
2,Elsie Dinsmore book 7,"I was definitely disappointed when I received this book. The image pictured was the same as the series I've been buying, but the book I received had an entirely different cover. I wouldn't have ordered this particular book if it had been pictured under as the one I received. I would not order from this seller again... I feel they misrepresented their product, and it would have cost me money to return it."
1,Keep looking!,"I'm finishing up a master's degree in reading and bought this at the beginning of my studies. Go with a different book, as this one completely misses the boat. It describes four basic patterns of knowledge organization as hierarchical, conceptual, sequential and cyclical. Yikes! In my research, I found a common theme of five basic patterns: Sequential, descriptive, cause-effect, problem-solution, and comparison-contrast. But...If you really want to roll up your shirtsleeves and teach kids how information is organized, I strongly recommend any book by David Hyerle on Thinking Maps. His research is incredible and the 8 maps he teaches will give kids and adults tools to help them wrestle with content, organization, writing, etc. That's what I'm using to teach my own kids how to read and think about nonfiction."
3,A Knowledgeable Friend,"Because a knowledgeable friend has been raving about Keen for years, I bought this CD. When I told him I'd found Keen's work merely workmanlike, he asked if several songs, which he named, were included. They weren't. He said he couldn't imagine that this was a true ""best of"" compilation. The songs are okay, the production is by-the-numbers. I'll listen one more time, down the road."
1,B&D MEANS POOR QUALITY,"The HH2450 I purchased lasted only 2 seasons. Even with careful use, the cheap plastic gear drive failed and could not be repaired by The Authorized B&D Service Center. Expect poor performance, from B&D's poor design, cheap materials and Mexican manufacturing standards. B&D is NOT the brand to buy."
4,B&D Hedge Hog 24,"I have a Sears 18"" 2.8amp trimmer, but I needed more cutting power so I bought the Hedge hog 24"". It was definitely an improvement, not as much blade speed but greater cutting power. Hedge branches from 1/4"" were very easy, but 1/2"" took some work but still cut. I researched online many trimmers and for the price/usefulness thought this was the best for my money. I have 40-50 ft of hedges on both sides of my yard, but if I had double the hedges, I might have considered a more powerful and heavy duty trimmer."
4,Makes a hard job a little easier,"Super sharp, long reach and easy to handle. The blade however is a little weak and easy to bend it you put the trimmer down the wrong way; be careful!Good value, hope it lasts 12 years like my old one!"
2,Not worth the price,"I purchased these shoes for my son based on the commercials and features of the shoes. I was very disappointed in the quality of them. The insole seemed like a piece of wood (very hard with no cushioning). After walking for a while, my son would complain that the bottoms of his feet hurt. To top that off, the shoes only lasted 5 months. They started falling apart, and he only wore them to school. Should have been made better for the price."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was specifically looking for the NU-KOTE brand, because the generic had not been working correctly in my machine. I chose these because they were stated to be NU-KOTE (I can buy generic anywhere) The ribbons I received were NU-KOTE compatible---BUT NOT THE NU-KOTE BRAND!!"
2,Wasn't what I expected- Not a childrens book,"I honestly love the excuse of having children to read silly little books that they enjoy, and was disappointed that a book written from the perspective of a dog and a cat didn't appeal as something to read to my children. It would probably have been something I could have halfway enjoyed if I had realized that when I downloaded it."
2,"Skip the first 10 chapters, the rest is best","I found the best parts of this book were the last chapters talking about Disney, GE and Coca Cola and their CEO's.I was very lost with the LARGE words in the begining, if there was a revision made to put the first 10 chapters into plain folk language I might have found it easier to digest.It also sounded more like a review of info from someone who had not ""been there and done that..."" rather a look from the outside.Cunninghams summary book, ""The Essasys of Warren Buffett"" is 100 x's better as a use of your time in my opinion."
4,How to think like Bejamin grham and invest like Warren Buffett,One of the most interesting books I've ever read on investing. Easy to read and understand the principles and investemnt criteria using by an outstanding value investor : Warren Buffett...
4,Humorous portrayal of the rats,"This is the second book in the first Slayer trilogy (Trollslayer, Skavenslayer, Daemonslayer) and is probably the best one in the series. What distinguishes it from the other instalments is the light-hearted descriptions of the rat warriors. Warhammer fans will find lots of fun in this book."
2,Oddly edited piece of Standard Deviants' Public Speaking DVD,"I purchased this tape along with the Standard Deviants' DVD titled ""Learn Public Speaking."" Turns out the video is merely a chunk (and a chunk that has no defined beginning or end) from the DVD. Save your money and get just the DVD."
3,An interesting look at pop culture via teen sleuths,"Although this book was a great idea and fun to read, it should have included more illustrations of the various book covers and just how valuable some of the originals are and focused a bit less on teen culture. The book does an excellent job of giving the history of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew and how the books came to be written and just how popular they still are. I believe the Hardy Boys should have been on the front cover and not the back cover. After reading this book it makes one wonder why so many of the books are out of print! They are excellent reading for kids of all ages and teach some valuable lessons that one won't get from video games!"
5,Queen of Soul: The Atlantic Recordings ~ Aretha Franklin,"This collection of her atlantic recordings is stupendous and amazing. Franklin is a tremendous artist with mega super hits such as think, respect, and many more. The book-let is very nice with high end photographs of Franklin and the covers of all her albums that she made for atlantic. There is so much to like about her and her amazing ability as a vocalist, muisician, lyricist and performer. The front cover photo is very nice with Franklin mayb e in her 30's or later, I have no idea, but it is a very nice photo and she looks great. Gotta love those tacky sunglasses on her 1975 release you. This is a very nice compilation that one should not miss."
5,AN INVESTMENT,"I bought the cassette version of this boxset over 5 years ago in an attempt to save money but have worn out the first three cassettes from too often singing the blues while travelling. I have finally gotten smart and am replacing it with the CD, despite the fact that I already know every song by heart as well the order in which they are played. Should have made the investment upfront. Agree that the compilation could do without the 4th disk - the 4th is the only cassette that I can still play."
1,Useless without audio tapes/cds!!!,There is a big problem!!! The 1st page of the workbook instructs you to LISTEN to expressions and then answer workbook questions. The problem is that audio tapes/CDs are nowhere to be found!!! This entire Integrated Korean series is completely useless without those tapes. It's really too bad because the text is thourogh and clear. The workbook is a nice accomplice. I reluctantly have no choice but to return my text and workbook.
4,GE OUT DOOR Security BOX,BOX WORKS WELL EASY TO SET UP AND MOUNT I DID MOUNT IT OUT SIDE UNDER A PLACE WERE THE RAIN OR SNOW WONT HIT IT.
2,Solid box - plastic controls,"I had one of these outside the house for a year for guests to use. The box is very durable and mounted securely, but the external moving parts to reset the push buttons and open the box are plastic. One day a guest tried to open the box and the little plastic piece snapped off rendering it useless. Two months later I was able to use a pen to reset the buttons, but the box is useless and has to be replaced.Now I'm looking for something that has controls as tough as the box."
1,Didn't work,"I just bought this. I put in my five numbers, but it did not open. I repeated that several times.Still did not open. I called the 800 number for customer service (written on the package). I did what the person told me and we tried two things. Neither worked. The unit still would not open. So I am returning this item to Lowe's. I will buy another brand, probably the Master Lock key safe."
4,Up a creek without a key!,"This product has saved me many hours of agravation, by having a secure spare key available when I needed it. I use the KeySafe at our cabin which is 55 miles from home. There have been a number of times that I have either arrived without a key, or inadvertantly locked myself out while at the cabin. With just a few key presses I am back to my expected routine. Great Product!"
3,Good brower and well enough for basic editing,"Good browser, with a lot of editing tools, but the functionality is limited with today's standards and to be honest, comparing it with other software e.g. Adobe's Photoshop or even the ACDSee Pro.I've got all these softwares, so I seldom use Olympus Studio 1.51, but for someone who doesn't use Photoshop or the ACDSee Pro I think that the Olympus software is well enough.I found it in a good price at the Amazon so I am completely satisfied (value/money)."
1,PRICE MATCHES PRODUCT,.....UNLESS YOU JUST LIKE WATCHING REALLY OLD AND OBSCURE MOVIES ...then avoid this turkey. This pack of dung is a shining example of why movie packs should be avoided ...they are just dumping grounds of unsellable movies......Of the ten movies in the pack the only one that was worth watching was My Favorite Brunette with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour ...it was typical Bob Hope fare and should satisfy his fans and a young Dorothy Lamour is always worth watching.
5,Jay and Molly....great music team,Cival War Classics....is a classic.....I have seen several productions from Jay and Molly.....they bringlife to this forgotten era of music....you won't me sorry.....I loved it!!
1,Drive Gear Melted Away,"I thought I purchased a reliable product from Black and Decker. Worked great for about 1 year. Today, suddenly the motor kept revving but the spool stopped spinning. I opened it up to find that the plastic gear that drives the shaft had melted away. I never cut heavy brush with this, only used it to edge my lawn. Judging from the cheap plastic gearing I will not buy another one of these trimmer as I am sure it will fail again."
1,Broke during first use.,"After waiting three weeks to receive the replacement part for the factory safety recall notice, I was finally able to use the trimmer for the first time this past weekend. After about 1/2 hour of moderate use, the trimmer stopped working. The motor and fan still run, but the trimmer head no longer turns. What a disappointment."
1,Buy any trimmer but this one!!,"I used this B&D piece of crap for all of ten minutes before I decided it had to go. I was looking for a solid, old fashioned plug in trimmer as I'd had bad experiences using gas and rechargeable units. My gas unit lasted 3 years and was hard to start, my rechargeable unit lasted 6 very underpowered years, but I was astounded at the poor performance I received from this B&D trimmer right out of the box. The AFS system they tout shot through a whole spool of line in around 5 minutes, and even though the power and ergonomics seem good my first use found me spending 20 minutes on maintenance for every 5 minutes of use. DO NOT BUY this unit unless you can afford to spend $7 to $10 for a replacement reel for every 5 to 10 minutes of trimming you need to do."
1,A poor product with even worse warranty service,"This is junk. Used lightly maybe ten times. Had to buy a new head cover plate, then power to head abruptly stopped. With 13 months left on the warranty, it was sent to the nearby B&H repair center for repair or replacement. A month later and one tel. call, I still don't have it. No more B&D products for me."
2,Worked GREAT for a while.,"The biggest problem I've had it with the automatic line feed.It's not automatic any more. I have to stop every three minutes or less and take the end cap off and pull out some string myself! Very irritating. I can't really afford another unit right at the moment so this is what I go through every time I need to edge the yard.I'm not real sure if this is caused by a bad batch of sticky line, or the machine? The line ""looks"" okay coming out of the wrapper but it could be wound wrong from the factory??? Either case, it's bad. I've been through quite a few packs of line with the same results. I think it's the machine."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"Avoid this product. After just a few uses the main drive gear, which is plastic, melted, rendering the trimmer unusable."
1,Don't buy it - It's Junk!,"There is a drive belt inside that attaches to plastic gears. My trimmer made it three months before breaking. The plastic gear melts. Looks like it's made out of the same plastic you would find in toys. Definitely not durable enough for the job. What were they thinking? Oh yeah, profits. But, that's the last dime Black and Decker is getting from me!"
5,Redesigned model works great,"Felt I needed to post a 5 star review to offset the old bad ones of previous models of this product. The new model of this trimmer works great. I have a nasty routine task for a string trimmer: chopping back a Bermudagrass lawn against a long, sharp gravel-finish driveway and walk. It demands a lot of power to trim through the tough Bermuda roots and the dirt they bring over the line with them, and the gravel finish is hell on the trimmer line. After 7 years of recurring pain with a Toro gas trimmer, I thought I would take advantage of the 30 day trial on the Grass Hog and give it a shot. The AFS feeder does what it says on the tin, I love the electric point and shoot simplicity, and it has the power of a table saw. The only thing I miss from the gas trimmer is the ability to run the spool at varying speeds, but I'll live. People have said control is a problem, but I find this lighter, more stable device easier to control than my heavy gas trimmer."
1,MY FOURTH ONE,"This trimmer works fine if you just use it for very light trimming. where I run into problems is if I try to use it in edger mode. I cannot even get to the end of my driveway, when it stops working. Seems the gear inside strips out. The motor runs but the trimmer quits. Like I said I'm on my fourth one, (keep taking it back to the store) and it just quit again."
1,Poorly designed and constructed -- do not buy,This has a difficult to replace string spool that can still come apart even using the post recall parts. It also does not hold up well. I had the familiar problem of having the drive mechanism burn out after about 6 uses. Motor spins but the cutter head does not. I won't buy another B&D yard tool.
4,I feel very much satisfied.,[...] advertisement attracted me the product with price. The order was prompty shipped. So I received what I needed without any additional cost and without going any where. I strongly recommend shopping quality products thru Amezon to save money and effort.
1,Close to Worthless,"Like many here, the teeth of the plastic gear that couples the motor to the line shaft melted down after about 15 or so uses. I guess I'm thankful I got that much out of it although I was replacing and respooling line like a mother. It seemed especially eager to eat line when attempting to edge. This was a 2007 model which is apparently not part of their recall as according to their site, ""it has already been repaired"". The individual at B&D who decided that putting a label over a screw hole was a good idea should be fired immediately although in that organization they've probably been promoted to at least a junior VP status by now."
2,Use only for light duty trimming,"Trimmer is OK for light duty work. I used it on heavier grass and the cheap plastic gear driving the shaft slipped on the belt driven by the electric motor, melted and failed.Black & Decker GH1000 Grass Hog XP 14-Inch 7.2 Amp Electric String Trimmer/Edger"
1,Not a good choice.,"I went through two of these before giving up. Both units died the same way, the motor works but the head stopped spinning. I was able to return both to Lowe's and I am currently looking for another weed whacker.It's a real shame because I own a number of other Black & Decker products that are solid. If you're considering buying this weed whacker look elsewhere, it WILL die."
2,Wrong product for the job,"After wearing out several B&D trimmers, I thought that this would be a more durable replacement. Although it is more powerful than the standard Grass Hog, it is much more difficult to control and the dual string spool is annoying to use and tends to throw alot of string pieces. This trimmer would be best for heavy duty brush trimming, but not the average yard trim work."
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this trimmer!","If the salesman tries to sell you this piece of Chinese junk, run away as fast as you can! I bought this last fall and immediately had trouble advancing the trim line. I thought it was because I was rewinding my own spools to save a buck or five! So, I bought one of their pre-wound spools for $5-something. No better. The thing just won't advance the trim line, period.Black and Decker used to be the most trusted name in tools and equipment. Not any more, not since they hired child labor overseas to build their stuff. I will NEVER buy another piece of B & D equipment...and this piece is going in the trash tonight!"
1,GrassHog = MoneyHog,"What a waste of money. Had it only one year and already it doesn't work. Motor sounds fine but head does not turn. I suspect something in the shaft has broken. I have only used it about 10 times for around flower beds, etc. I have a separate edger for driveway/curbs so it really hasn't been worked very hard. Sad part is I have always been a B&D fan. No more! Last piece of foreign equipment I buy -- especially with the name ""Black & Decker"" on it!"
4,works fine now,No problems after a year. All the negative reviews seem to be for the earlier versions for the GH1000.
1,plastic shaft pulley is a cheap chinese part destined to fail...,"Looks like the hokey looking motor assembly is made in Shanghai. Unfortunately the plastic shaft gear easily melts it's teeth into the drive belt ruining both (really, how much would a better metal gear cost?). A check on the B & D parts page doesn't offer the faulty gear pulley as a part, only a whole motor assembly for over $60 plus shipping - hardly worth the repair cost. I hate throwing something in the garbage that fails due to one small, ill conceived, and unavailable component, and so i think this will be my last Black and Decker purchase. Too cheap to do the job and didn't last my occasional light use."
1,motor works but trimmer stopped turning,"I've had good luck w/ B&D but this is a disappointment. Wait ... I didn't check to see if the newer ones are made in China. It's so new I'm still using the original string on it. When I was using it, it stopped rotating. The motor still works but the other end has stopped. Then I went back to my 2 yr old Ryobi which is worse (made in China). I think tomorrow I will put both of these in the trash can, do my research and spend another $100 on something else. Don't waste your money on either of these products."
1,Multiple defective parts - avoid,"My experience echos that of others here. I bought the first one in fall of 2006, used it once and had the drive train break in < 5 minutes. I exchanged it, figuring it was a fluke. Didn't use the new one at all until summer of 2007. Upon the first time using it, the string advance was obviously broken from within the first 5 minutes of use. It managed to auto-advance the entire spool of factory stock string in the time it took me to do half of my front yard. I was picking up chopped string bits all over the yard that where anywhere from an inch to 4 inches long. Sometimes, the string would be advanced so far that it would get caught and pop the spool cap right off. My neighbor enjoyed the amusement, though after the 5th or 6th ""Good Grief!"" range out from me while trying to use this thing. I had to borrow his to finish up my yard. This Grass Hog is going back for store credit. I wouldn't even take one for free it's so bad."
1,Cheap parts,"I was trimming weeds when the motor stopped driving the trim head. I opened the case and found that the drive sprocket had melted. The drive belt was okay and the metal motor sprocket was okay. Toys have plastic gears and sprockets, real power tools use metal parts for the drive train. Buyer be ware! Also who uses a product for a few days and gives it a 5-star rating?"
1,Poor design for a string trimmer,"I have owned this trimmer for six months, and am disappointed in the design. While there have been no mechanical failures,and the conversion from horizontal trimming to vertical trimming (edging) is easy, I do not like the automatic line feed feature. The machine feeds line more often than necessary, causing the need for frequent spool changes, which are a bit pricey (around $9.00 each!) In addition, when the line feeds, there is no notice, of course, and the machine often gouges a big chunk of grass, especially when edging. I would prefer a machine that I would need to bump, after using this one. All-in-all, not a good design."
1,Crap for Black and Decker.,"I bought this a few years ago and hate it. It goes through a spool with every use. It does not feed line automaticly. I both a gas and I'm much happier. Go with gas, you will be much happier, and with the less spools, I buy, it is a lot cheaper."
1,"It may be a good price, but just don't buy it!",I bought this trimmer at my local Home Depot. This morning I attempted to edge approximately 30 feet of my driveway and walkway area. I had to stop and fix the automatic spool feeder no less than 7 times...7 TIMES! Black and Decker should take better care of their customers and test their products more thoroughly. Thankfully my Home Depot store was willing to give me a store credit and they can deal with Black & Decker. I never will again.
1,Worthless,"Powerful when it worked, but five minutes of use and the line stopped coming out. My wife and I spent hours with the manual (which incorrectly depicts some of the contours of the machine) and could never get it to work correctly. The spool would either flake out or the plastic cover would pop off and go flying every 1-2 minutes.Completely worthless. I wasted hours with this product and got a total of about 20 feet of trimming and maybe 30 square feet of long grass cut. I could be wrong, but it SEEMS like (unless mine and the others posted here are just unusual lemons) either: 1. Black and Decker never fieldtested this device; or 2. they did field test it and put it on the market knowing it is utterly worthless. Either way, I'm not buying another Black and Decker product for a long time."
1,Poor Performing,"The twine kept getting tangled in the motor housing. The last time it tangled I was not able to untangle it - even the gentleman at Ace Hardware could not untangle it. I did not purchase this trimmer online, but fortunately the ACE Hardware where I purchased it allowed me to return it for a full refund. I had only had the trimmer for 5 days, used it for maybe 4 hours. Very dissatisfied with the product. Black and Decker needs to address the issue with this product."
1,Piece of junk,"This item is not worth 10 cents. Bought one at Home Depot. Broke in 10 minutes caused by a cheap plastic drive gear that burns up the minute you get in tall grass and put a load on it. Complained and they did send me another. Same story. Whatever happened to ""made in America"" and made to last. Never buy Black and Decker again. rw"
1,Absolute junk...Why haven't they recalled?,"Mine had less than 3 hours weed-eating on it when I had the same problem everybody else seems to be having: motor spins, string head doesn't! I work in manufacturing and I can't imagine a company being so unresponsive to consumer input, or putting out a piece of garbage like this. If this is what B & D has come to, I don't think I can ever trust another one of their products. I hope everybody reads this review and is smart enough to STEER CLEAR of B & D products!By the way, Amazon, you need to add a ""0"" star rating. :)"
1,Unreliable,"I bought this from a national retailer last October based on the very high rating from Consumer Reports (it's highest rated corded string trimmer). It was only used once that fall. I got it out again this spring and used it a few times until it broke. The motor would run at high speed, but the trimmer wouldn't spin. I took it apart and found that the belt had melted one of the parts. This made it so that the belt wouldn't stay in place and would slip off. So, basically, I was able to use it 4 or 5 times and then it broke. Since it's well past the 90 day return, I'll either have to work with B&D warranty, or toss it in the trash. This is the same problem that others have reported in the reviews here. This is a completely unreliable product. Do not buy it."
1,Big hassle,"The line constantly binds and doesn't feed even with the pre wound that B & D sells. Then 8 uses later on grass and dirt, the bottom of the reel wears out and you can't get it at the hardware store where you bought it.My cool looking Grass Hog is, after 2 months of light use now in the land fill. Even Good Will realizes its short cumin's and wouldn't take it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I have the updated model that does not have the defect - and it is still an awful, awful, awful product. I would bet money that the ""good"" reviews are from B&D marketing folks trying to save face on their investment in the product. It is junk."
1,Poor vocal talent and unfounded lyrics.,"If I could give this album less than one star I would. Brent Burns has virtually no vocal talent which obviously why he only lays on the beach while Jimmy Buffett (spelled with two ""T's) counts his money. It sounds as if he tape-recorded the album on a home stereo system with a Karaoke function. I also found the song ""If It's Snowbird Season Why Can't We Shoot 'Em?"" to be interesting since the beach he lays on is not located in Florida but in Alabama. Maybe he should stick to writing about the ten mile stretch of land he uses as a beach instead of writing about Florida beaches for which he was a tourist on as well. In short do not waste your money on this CD your money is better spent on something credible."
3,"ok, has its moments","Moronic villians insist on challenging (yeah, right) unstoppable Ken, and the Jackal comes across as the smartest of the bunch because he at least knows to run away after he's perturbed our hero. The real fun doesnt come until the next volume in which Jackal gets blowed up real good."
4,Great tab!,Has a great song collection not easy to find. Tabs are spot on. Easy to follow and sounds great playing along with the album.
4,Realistic heroine,"I really liked this book - it was refreshing having the heroine not be the ""most beautiful and wanted woman."" The heroine is actually described as being somewhat overweight and not considered beautiful, but the hunky hero finds her desirable regardless. It was a great read with just enough adventure to keep you turning pages but not tedious in too many obstacles to the final love everlasting ending."
3,Would've liked more....,I enjoyed this book for the most part but some of the Scottish dialect was hard to follow and feel the author could've been more descriptive with the surrounding characters. I found myself looking for more story. The main characters were fun and very appealing but I feel it could've went one step further.
4,An introduction to facts about the sun.,"This is an excellent book for children describing some of the latest known facts about the Sun and serves as an introduction and suplementary text for young children. This book is a part of Isaac Asimov's Library of the Universe he started for children in the late 1980's that is supposed to be updated on a regular basis. However, Dr. Asimov died in 1992 and others are trying to continue the work. The book has since been updated in Asimov's New Library of the Universe and retitled ""The Sun and Its Secrets"" by Asimov and Francis Reddy."
2,It has nothing additional to the Big Book,I purchased this book because I imagined that it might have some annotations to help understand the context of the fist 164 pages in the Big Book. I should have read the description more carefully because the only thing this book offered was a lined page after each page in the book for you to write down your own notes so I was disappointed.M.M.
1,Saving Freud's psychoanalysis,"I haven't read the whole book, as already the introduction and the first chapter reveal that the author is not playing his cards openly. He is obviously a practising psychoanalyst but doesn't tell us that. He has not even read ""Why Freud was wrong"", but thinks that he can still rebut it. He doesn't address the real arguments of Crews but takes on side issues. In short, the book is for true believers only."
1,There needs to be an engraving option,I am looking for one of these for my Mom who I care for. We live in a small town; if she wanders the main information needed on the bracelet is her name and my phone number.I didn't buy this product and this is more intended as a suggestion to the seller. Why not provide an engraving option at a modest cost? Or make it clear that it can be easily engraved? Without that it seems of little value.
4,emergency bracelet,"I bought two of these bracelets; one for my mother in law and one for my husband. They are great. I've worn one for many years without any trouble at all. The only thing I would change would be to have the option of making the bracelet non-removable. The blank bracelets are great because then you don't have to use the prefab wording. Take the blank bracelet to your local jeweler. They can engrave just about anything, with your choice of text size and font. It is cheap! Way cheaper than buying it already done. I've been happy enough with them that I'll be ordering two more because situations have changed and I need to update the information."
3,Almost too comprehensive,"Oddly enough, I feel that this outline was almost too comprehensive to be useful for studying for my T&E law school final exam. The detailed outline is close to 300 pages long, and attempts to address every possible iteration of the law of Trusts and Estates, including common/federal and state specific law, the Uniform Trust Code, the Wills Act and other areas. In my opinion, this shotgun approach made weeding out the law applicable in my area from the other chaff extremely difficult. If the outline were organized in a different fashion, i.e., where how the issues in this subject were collectively addressed by the form of law (e.g., all federal law issues grouped together, all common law issues grouped together, discussion of UTC grouped together etc.) this book would have been eminently more useful to me. The sad thing is, the content of this outline is extremely good and detailed. Its organization, however, makes learning that content more of a chore than it has to be."
1,Doesn't Work,Followed instructions to the letter and nothing happened. Still have trouble getting to sleep. Did accomplish one thing. They gave me the runs.
3,Not the whole story,"This book was interesting, but I found that it only told the story from the newspaper reporter's point of view. I think they should have interviewed the relatives of the victims also."
1,Toxic Trash,Lesbian man hating at it's worst. Avoid this toxic feminist poison guys. Men are evil? That makes men cool.
4,Actron CP7803,"Item works as it should and at a good price. The dial size is nice and the length of tubing that comes with the kit was helpful. The adaptors supplied will allow someone to do what the unit is intended for. My only criticizm is the plastic material the adapters are made of. The plastic gets rather soft being around the engine. I do not believe this affected the testing; however, I was concerned with the adapters breaking when disconnecting them.Overall, a good purchase and a good value."
3,Good academic look at the development of PCR.,"""Making PCR"" starts slowly; the opening is more for academic anthropologists than for readers interested in biotechnology, so wade through it. The story of PCR is intertwined with the story of Cetus Corporation, which is developed more fully in ""Biotechnology Backstage"" by former Cetus scientist Paul Aebersold and available from Kabel Publishers. ""Making PCR"" constrains itself to such an academic view that it leaves out the most amazing part of the story, a fight started by Kary Mullis at a Cetus scientific retreat that got him demoted to the bench to concentrate his efforts on PCR!"
3,(3.5 stars) ...Turbulent and intense...,"This author takes a volatile subject and turns it into a powerful message. Sensing that her life has spun out of control, the promiscious Ella finds her fragile sense of self defined by the unpredictable and dangerous rush of setting fires. As a child, Ella found herself helpless, powerless, drawn into the roar of cleansing flames. As a young woman, Ella's personal disintegration has led to drunken laisons with strangers, further shredding her minimal self-worth. Surrounded by family secrets, covered with burn scars, Ella could be a pathetic creature in lesser hands. But this Ella is a survivor, and Steinke gives her the courage to confront her life. The inner scars are what drive Ella; she can live with those that map her flesh.It takes consummate skill to propel a story through the stages of renewal and redemption, without resorting to facile techniques. This writer, in lyrical and visual prose, creates a heroine worthy of notice, deserving of respect."
2,Too Much?? Not Enough!!,"Wow, I guess I am in the minority in rating this book. I was very disappointed by this follow up to Too Much Temptation (which I enjoyed). I have read many LF books, and usually love every one of them. This one disappointed me completely. Where were the usual sexy, fun characters? Where were the sizzling hot love scenes between the two main characters? The secondary characters of Ben's mother, Brooke, and Kent were the best part of the book. I was more interested in their story (which was minor) than in Ben and Sierra's. Finally, the ex-husband revenge plot was too much for even me to believe! I would recommend every other one of Ms. Foster's books except this one, unfortunately."
4,Interesting,"This is a different kind of book, an historical collection of mementos. Nice coffeetable book."
2,Beyond a Wicked Kiss by Jo Goodman,"I was completely inthralled by the first half of this book. It was my first Jo Goodman book and although it was the last in the series I didn't have any trouble following it.I give it only 2 stars because the second half of the book was so dark and degrading to women it was repulsive. The villains were into white slavery, sadomasochism and bondage. Goodman writes very graphic scenes of these practices and the heroine was subject to them. I could have known about them without having to endure them and it would not have detracted from the story at all. She left me feeling abused.I am still tempted to read another of her book but not until I find out if she writes this way all the time. Her imagery was wonderful. Character development was excellent."
2,Not what they say!,"This DVD has the music of the Platters and advertises the Crickets and Lenny Welch. There is nothing by Lenny Welch on the DVD that I received and only two songs by the Crickets. Platters are OK for the few songs they have on the DVD but not great. I would not buy it again, it is over rated at two stars, but the music brings it up from one star. I consider it a waste of money."
4,I love these watch,"These watch is versatile , you can use it in 6 ways , is a little big but I love it."
5,You posted both of my reviews!!,I wrote my review a second time because I thought I'd done something wrong and you weren't going to post it. Please delete the review dated October 23 and leave the later version. Thank you.
2,ready to gamble?,"The first screen wouldn't retract at all, no matter how many different people tried it (and we have experience with blind rollers). I returned it and the second one arrived with broken screws and a cracked side, as if someone had tried to open it to repair it. Tiger Direct was kind enough to refund all my shipping and advised me to try the Elite Screen 100"" Diagonal 16:9 Pull Down Projection Screen, which is only $10 more but with a lot less complaints.Update: the Elite Screen arrived broken and I gave up on under-$100 projector screens."
3,Not bad,It works great but I thought it would be bigger and able to accommodate the project I have but its easier to project on a blank wall than to hang hooks and set this up.
1,A complete piece of junk,"The screen itself(the actual white part) is fine, but this thing will NOT go back up at all and furthermore as soon as I took it out of the box to hang it, it just unraveled out by itself and hung there like it was rolled up on a paper towel roll. Junk."
2,Pretty dated and cheaply made,The information was pretty well dated and the DVD was of poor quality. The information is good and scary but I was disappointed in the quality of the presentation.
3,Get Off My Honor,"I was disappointed. I thought it would be more about why being a Boy Scout reaching for the rank of Eagle is and honorable thing to do and that some values are timeless and why these values are important for or modern society. I believe that is true. Instead, I found it more of a gay bashing and Girl Scout bashing book. I know that Girl Scouts have changed over time, but so have the role of women."
2,"While an scout, author needs to do better research","First off, while I am a long time scout and scouter, and do not like how some groups have been attacking the BSA, I don't fully agree with the author.One glaring issue I have with the book is that the author needs to do better research. Too often he used second/third hand works instead of going to the source. If you're going to quote B-P, read his works and cite them, not someone else who quotes him from another source. I also saw several area in which the author is not knowledgable about something (he is very ignorant of the originals of Girl Scouts/Girl Guides) and should have done his home work."
5,wilt pruf,Great stuff when you are transplanting trees and bushes.. Helps them not to be too shocked.
2,Kenwood FS-130 Meat Slicer,"I knew when I purchased this unit that cleaning up would a challenge, but hoped that the time saved slicing meat would more than compensate for the clean up time of the blade parts and sliding components. Alas I must say it is not true unless you have a large amount of beef or ham to slice. It is just not that fast or smooth working to make it worth getting out for the smaller roast or turkey. I think if I did it again, I would spend more and buy a larger unit. You also need to cut up large roasts to smaller sized pieces for it to work well with this slicer"
2,Ok but flawed,"While thought proking, Mr. Garten has seemingly done quite a bit of thorough research but his end conclusions are rather biased and without merit. By forgetting our own nation, his view points for the future make rather little sense and his viewpoints stem from a anging liberal who clearly doesn't understand current economic policy."
3,Buyer Beware!!,"I was excited when I saw this CD on Amazon. The tracking list says all these are album versions. They are not! ""Strange Way"" for example is an edit of the single version (and not a very good one at that). I don't understand why Rhino would re-issue this greatest hits cd and not put the album versions on it. And to make is worse, Amazon is promoting it. Sad to say, this CD is being returned as false advertising."
5,Firefall had a very small nich.,Firefall had a very small nich to fill and it did a great job of it. I very much enjoy this cd. I would recommend it to any fan of Firefall (even slightly).
1,"Not Full ""Strange Way""",Warning! The version of Strange Way on here is not the full version. The up-tempo flute riff part at the end is missing.
2,"""Greatest Hit"" is a more accurate title","Mid-70s coutry rockers Firefall produced about a half a dozen interchangeable albums and exactly one memorable song, ""You are the Woman,"" that became a staple on FM radio at the time. The song's a keeper, a decent hook and some good harmonies that is ready made for today's soft rock radio formats. Beyond that, what you get are a lot of similar sounding songs that rolls along blandly. The best summation I can think of is that at their very best, Firefall recorded tracks that could have been used as filler material on any original Eagles studio album. The rest of the time they weren't even that good."
5,Wow,"Greg Overton is a friend of mine and he played bass and did vocals in this band. When we first met, he mentioned the band and I couldn't quite remember it. He was surprised and then sand a few lines from ""You are the Woman"" and I was like oh yeah I remember that. I had never bought any of their albums. That was the only song I could recall. So I finally buy this CD and I'm in shock.....my gawd...NOW I remember them! I remember their songs from the radio, but just didn't recall the name of the band. I'm actually listening to it right now and can't believe I wasn't more of a fan except I was buried in work during those years.It really is great music. If you're wondering, this CD is terrific and a great deal for the price. Which reminds me, when last we spoke Greg told me they were doing a reunion tour (this was a couple years ago) and now to my embarrassment I have to thank him for the music I enjoyed years ago he was a part of and am enjoying now."
5,What I was looking for.,"Very pleased with this cd, as I saw Firefall in concert years ago when they opened for the Beach Boys at the then newly built Louis J. Tullio Convention Center in Erie, PA... as both groups were the first to play at that center and it is good to hear Firefall again on cd and their short lived history of fine songs they created."
3,"Interesting plot, good for a ""quickie""","A very interesting plot. More depth to characters needed. At times, Huston's thriller was really edge-of-your-seat-stuff; at other times, ""hokey"". Still, I recommend for a quick read."
1,Poorly written,"After reading the other reviews, I was looking forward to a riveting book. But I was greatly disappointed. The quality of the writing was very uninspiring and basic. There were times I thought I was reading one of my child's fourth grade book. The characters were poorly developed. Finally, the book came to a simple ending, as if the author ran out of interest in the remaining pages. I was hoping to enjoy it like Vince Flynn's recent books, Term Limits and Transfer of Power, But this book palled in comparison. I will not read another book by this author."
4,I learned something,"This is an action packed book that leaves you at the end of every chapter wanting more. This is one of the few action adventure books where I could not guess what was going to happen next. I learned more about military jargon, congress, and the Federal judicial system in this book than I ever did in school. It's a fast paced book that will keep your heart pounding.JFK"
2,2 stars for me,"It is true that this is original, but it's hard to say it is music. Well, music, but I would disagree about giving it 5 pts because, the singer does seem to be singing in most of the songs, but just reading the lyrics really dully."
3,Okay but could be better quality,"This works wonderfully if you dont want to get down on your hands and knees and go round the beds trimming grass. It takes a lot off the backache. However, the appliance is made of really cheap plastic, the wheels fall of the axle all the time, and the handle slips."
4,Very Handy - works great,"This item is essential if you have Black and Decker grass shears. Who wants crawl around on the ground when they trim? The book, however, is lacking assembly info for all the models that the handle fits. I finally just threw the book out and guessed how to attach the handle to my sheer. Fortunately, that wasn't hard once I wasn't trying to follow the wayward directions and figure out what to do with the left over pieces."
3,Extension handle,"Typical Black & Decter. Utilitarian, instructions impossible to read and assembly was annoying since I could not figure out how to attach it."
1,My customer satisfaction with this book is very low.,"I deeply regret not heeding the comments of the online reviewers. Mainly because, I was raised on Chilton manuals and have never been disappointed until now. This manual is lacking in critical information for your most basic repairs. The layout is extremely confusing. Chilton has dropped many of it's covered mechanical repairs and I can find no information on chasiss electrical, or engine electrical. I have a ASS in Automotive Technology and a ASS in Electrical Technology. I am also ASEcertified. There is no way I can purchase another Chilton manual From Amazon.Com. I must now preview it at the bookstore first. If there is anyway I can replace this so called comprehensive manual with another I will and return this book."
4,More Reasons than Knapp!,"To be honest, the real reason I bought this CD was because a song I wanted was on it called ""(You Got Me) Burnin' Up."" David LaSalle has been playing it this summer in Ptown at the A-House. What a great song by Cevin Fisher. To my surprise, I really enjoyed all the other dance songs in this collection by DJ David Knapp, considered one of the Top3 DJ's in America. This is music that will get you moving when you feeling low or when it""s dreary outside, or when you're having a party with your friends. Its house, plus light trance. Nothing beats ""Muscles"" by Club 69, or another favorite ""Maria"" by Blondie."
5,Gunka gunka gunka,"I first heard Agent Orange through my brother and his friends during their skate-rat years. I got a tape copy of the original Posh Boy tape release and wore it out. I got a copy of the CD rerelease a couple of years back and the songs held up superbly.This album still hits a good nerve in me, and the song ""Everything Turns Grey"" just washes over me with one of the coolest guitar riffs and solos I've heard. Every song on this CD (except for the interview, which is kinda cool but could have been discarded) is implanted in my mind. During college, my garage band decided to cover ""Cry for Help in A World Gone Mad.""Just awesome. One of my top 5 favorite records ever. I'll never be without it."
3,Send Up A Room,"The Marx Brothers return. This is a decent Marx Brothers film. Lucille Ball appears in this one...she actually doesn't have a very big role or a funny role she is more just window dressing on this film. The film has some bright moments but overall is not one of the better Marx Brothers films by any means. If you are a Marx Brothers fan you may want to add this to your collection...otherwise if you are just looking for a real entertaining Marx Brothers film try ""Duck Soup"" or ""A Day At The Races"" and let this one rest."
1,not that great.,not that great a movie. I felt little empathy towards the main characters and was not hopeful about their outcome.
3,Difficult to match the book...,"I loved the book this was based upon, and had long hoped that someone would make a film of it, while realising that to capture the atmousphere the book had for me would be difficult. However, the film has caught the quirky charm of the book, and I thought it was well worth watching - the main actors suited the roles well - though seeing Amelia Fox in this setting was odd after her recent TV appearance. Subtlely different from the book but, as I have re-read the book several times, I am sure I will watch this again."
4,Good story,Well done story. Good story arc with nice rom-dram plot - and not sappy at all. Entertaining and memorable.
5,loved it,"I love it , as the original movie I like how the wife loved her husband so much and helped him . I liked the white fly and how they made it look this movie takes you on a trip of wonder"
2,"""Good Destruction, Bad Dialogue","The idea of a Liquid Natural Gas Tanker exploding in NYC is an excellent idea for a story. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson needed better execution. His scenes of destruction in Manhattan and Staten Island is the only reason this books gets 2 stars and not 1. The characters were poorly done. The dialogue was not natural and, in some cases, unrealistic. And I grew tired of the main characters, Rider and Amura, calling each other ""Dear"" and ""Darling"" every other line. More inner thought was needed to truly flesh out the characters. Also many of the scenes went overboard on the melodrama. With better character development and a few more plot lines, this book could have been so much better."
4,"Good product, but how do you fill it?",A regular air pump with or without a needle does not appear to work to inflate this product well. It is very rugged and durable feeling though.
1,Poorly written short stories,"I'm glad I was able to download these short stories for free because I would be very upset if I wasted money on them. The concepts for the stories are interesting, however all three lack character development, thorough plot development, and a satisfying conclusion. I didn't feel like I really knew any of the characters, and they seemed to change throughout the story without explanation, almost like the author wasn't sure of who the characters were either. As for the conclusions, I felt like I was left hanging at the end of each story wanting to know more. All in all, the stories are quick reads and have an interesting concept, but are not well written."
5,Sharp & Sweet,"I picked up this book of translations because I'd read one of the poems on Poetry Daily and was instantly captivated. The poems don't read like translations--they are vital, graceful, funny, bleak--and in that sense they certainly feel contemporary. But I wouldn't say that they are ever contemporary at the expense of the classic originals--instead they remind us that perceptions and emotions rendered this sharply and cleanly centuries ago still have the power (when translated by the right person) to reach us in the here and now. This volume doesn't read like a set of translations; the voice is compelling, it's range is considerable, and each time I open it a different poem becomes my favorite. (It's probably also worth saying that the production values on this book are impressive--it's a beautiful object to keep around.)"
2,Does not measure up,"I do not like this sifter at all because it starts out sifting while using the spring action handle and then it stops sifting after a few pulls and you end up having to shake the sifter to get the flour out. Now I see why it's up as a clearance item. Don't waste your money if you are buying it for its intended purpose. You might get by with doing a cup, but no way will it do more without shaking it and hitting it against your other hand. This one was a let down. I ended up ordering the hand cranking kind because I know they work pretty good."
5,Great Service: The Right Book at the Right Time,Thanks so much for getting me the book I needed in time for my Spanish class. It was exactly the right text for the class and cost much less than at the college bookstore. I also appreciate your e-mail correspondence to confirm and check on the progress of my order. I'd buy from you again any time!
2,function outweighs beauty,"This is a beautiful little pot. Unfortunately, it has many problems which makes it function poorly. The cover threatens to come off when you pour, and leaks burning steam. Also, the pour spout is very narrow making the pouring process excruciatingly slow. To top it all off, it the spout drips as it pours. I love the way this pot looks, and will keep it for special occasions, but when I want to boil a lot of water and pour it out fast, I'll have to get another pot:("
1,Won't work on flat top electric range,"I was disappointed to get this tea pot and find it wouldn't work on a flat top electric range. I went back and read the original information on Amazon and found it didn't directly contain that information. As a result, I was stuck with shipping charges. Big disappointment!"
5,A very scary film ...,"This film goes behind the scenes as an American working overseas uncovers a world of sexual exploitation of underage girls being used as sex slaves by the the employees of the contractors used by our government and paid by us. Trying to uncover proof of what she has found, this whistleblower is rebuffed at every turn by the members of our own government. A shameful story that is still going on, and can be today be revealed in the work being done by POGO, an organization determined to lift the cover off the world of government corruption. Our government."
4,Superb acting thru horror.,The movie was good in that it exposed the Organization for it's villany and the horror in which it inflicks onto others. The actors superbly showed how people do really act in real life.
5,CITY OF MEN,WATCH THIS I THINK THEIR ARE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE DVDS START FROM THE BEGINNING AMAZON HAS THEM ALL CITY OF MEN IS THE LAST U WILL LV ALL SERIES EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT
1,waste of time and money,No reason to watch this movie. Both my husband soon realized that the City of Men was a quick way to rob those who loved City of God by selling it as a sequel. HORRIBLE and POINTLESS....first time I ever wrote a review on any movie in my life...that BAD.
5,Not just for cat lovers!,"How to Have Purr-fect Faith is a book that shows how one can incorporate faith in everyday living. Laura happens to show cats as a hobby, and although the book tells the story of how through her faith she achieved her dream, the dream did not happen instantly, nor without hardship and setbacks along the way. A truly inspirational book on how faith does work wonders."
4,All you ever wanted to know about Glass's music in one place,"This book is the quintessential read for anyone interested in the composer be he the music lover realaxing to his recording of ""Glassworks"" or the avid ""Glass-ite"" with all five hours of ""Einstein on the Beach"" memorized (and I salute you). Whatever you wanted to know about Glass and especially the operas can be found here in the composer's own words. Like his music, Glass's book is fluid and encompassing. Seth Bedford (guiseppe@earthlink.net) Midland,TX."
3,small job trimmer,"Black & Decker DS700 6-Volt Cordless Electric ShrubberIt works fine for small light jobs, its intended purpose, but not powerful enough for full size hedges, nor is battery life intended for prolonged use. The 6 volt battery is a little under powered also. But for short minimal clean up its fine. For seasonal trimming of bit bushes use a scissor, its easier."
1,Dead in six months...,"I bought one of these through Amazon a couple of years ago. The batteries in it lasted less than a year before giving out. I'm very familiar with how to properly take care of NiCd batteries -- use them until they run down then charge them up all the way in one sitting, but don't leave them plugged into the charger. They still didn't last. For the amount I was using it, that was maybe six charges total."
2,Not very powerful,"I purchased this tool because I have quite a few small boxwoods that I need to trim. I thought a small shrubber like this would be great, especially since it is cordless. However, the slow cutting speed makes it inadequate for the job, and the battery makes it quite heavy, not ideal when you have more than a few shrubs to trim. I am using my manual hedge shears again.Only buy this for very light work."
4,The 6 volt cordless electric shrubber,"The shrubber is ideal for what it was made for. It does a good job triming small branches or twigs. It should only be used for new growth, not last years growth. The battery time will give one about 20 minutes of cutting."
2,too short for general use,"not good for general use, if you already have a long one, and really have tiny bushes to trim, you can buy one as a plus."
1,dissapointing,"Poor product.I have a few small boxwood shrubs and some holly bushes. I expected this trimmer to quickly trim these branches, this trimmer is worthless. I had to use my hand shears and I plan to buy an electric trimmer to get the job done next time!"
2,Battery doesn't last long.,"Cuts just fine.Battery ran out after cutting a little over three bushes. These were somewhat small bushes about a two and a half foot diameter shrub.I imagine a corded one would have been a more suitable choice since all of these bushes were near my front porch and I could have easily ran an extension cord. I just bought it because I was on a cordless kick with a blower, edger and mower.I think my main complaint about all of these devices is the battery time or power. This one was the time. Power was sufficient."
3,Product is Adequate,"The cordless electric shrubber was adequate but not spectacular in its performance. It was shipped and delivered as expected in a reasonable manner. I certainly wish it had multiple replaceable batteries like previous black and decker cordless tools, so I could keep working with one battery while another one was on charge."
4,A great music compilation,This album has something for everyone .From the chilling sounds of Aurora and Chicane to the dark trance of Delirium and Marc Et Claude to the warping house of the Warp Brothers and Hi-Gate.There's even a bit of Matt Darey and Fatboy Slim towards the end of each CD.Buy it and it WILL take you on a journey...
5,Goodies for kids and adults,"Hopefully the trend toward restoring Americana's wonderful musical theatre productions to an important part of our culture will strengthen. Who can resist the compassionate views of human-kind written by the icon, Dr. Seuss. ADORABLE"
3,Does not displace Jochum or Karajan,"I listened for the earth shattering epic quality the Seventh can have an really feel somewhat let down by the Scottish National Orchestra here...balances are fine and playing very nice but the phrasing lacks some of the bite and poise of even Barenboim who did a fine job of this in Chicago.The slow movement is done very nicely here, and I give the slow movement here the heads up above alot of the competition. That being said I will certainly keep my Jochum and Karajan Berlin DG ones over this...I just found the finale of this performance a bit too staid and somewhat restrained for my personal liking!"
4,Chopsticks to love.,"I have made a habit of buying chopstick sets as gifts for my husband, ever since we started dating. I found these as stocking stuffers last Christmas, and he named them as his favorite gift from me.Beautiful and functional, these chopsticks stand out in our collection for being both modern and traditional. The unusual color combination is every bit as vibrant as it is depicted online, a great surprise.The laqueur can make them a bit slick for tackling dishes like shark fin stews -- I have dropped mine a few times, but then again, my notorious ineptitude with chopsticks may make that more likely to happen to me with or without laquer -- but they are well constructed and hold up well after multiple washings and heavy use.For entertaining, nothing beats these gorgeous chopsticks. For one dinner, we mix-and-matched the colors to create a different (and stunning) visual effect to rave reviews.Highly recommended, for eye-candy *and* utility."
5,Hits of the 30's and 40's,"We loved the music. It brought back so many memories of the days when we could dance and sing to the music. The choices were very good. I would have liked even more songs with words but I am happy with the music, too. I get a lot of things from Amazon and am always satisfied. I don't have to worry about payment. It is taken care of automatically."
1,Doesn't hold up,"Too bad I had to assign it even one star - it doesn't deserve any. Sound was great. You notice I said WAS. Just as it went out of warranty, it got a short in one of the earphones because the cord broke at the point where it is attached to the gasket that is meant to protect the cord as it enters the earphone. Also, cord could have been a bit longer - 5' isn't much if your CPU sits on the floor and not near you."
1,Dont waste your money....,"Just awful headphones for the money. Boomy one-note bass, mids are harsh and start to roll off towards the top of the spectrum. Treble is rolled off slightly too. Isolation is not as great as the marketed hype. My DT770 trounce them from an isolation standpoint, as do my Shure e2c. Fragile headband snaps after a week of delicate use.For under $150 there are many better headphones:AKG K240s-55 / K501Koss KSC75Sennheiser HD201, HD580, HD100, HD280Grado SR60/80/125Alessandro MS1Shure e2c / e3cSony MDRV6, MDR-7506Potential buyers... surf over to www.head-fi.com . Run a ""Search"" for ""triport"". 100's of disapointed user impressions there."
3,Black electrician's tape!,"5 stars for sound and 1 star for construction and durability (as has been mentioned elsewhere). I am writing to give you a tip if you choose to buy these great-sounding headphones: immediately wrap the headband with electrician's tape whereever screws can be seen. My experience has been that this is where they will break WHEN they break (it's not a matter of IF). How sad that Bose charges so much for such crappy construction. So, why do I bother? These headphones really sound great and will block out distractions at moderately low levels."
3,poor quality,should of read the reviews before purchasing....returned the item because we were concerned that the headphones would break with daily use.
2,Bose Triports...Love 'em or hate 'em...or both.,"The Triports have excellent sound. If they could just sit on your ears with no suspension design that would be a dream come true. However, for what ever reason, Bose has decided to make the headband not more than about a centimeter in width. The pressure of the band, after a while, wears a groove in the skin of my scalp, which is then very uncomfortable. Also the plastic of the headband is very cheap and will break in many pieces soon, out of stress wear. Keep your superglue handy. Mine have been repaired about 4 times. I inquired about parts from Bose and was told that if I sent the phones in, that it would be only $65 to repair them. Thanks.So I wear my Triports with a credit card between the headband and my scalp so they don't hurt, and the plastic is all patched up with superglue, etc. My wife says they're very attractive. But.....the sound is great!!"
2,Disappointment,"When I first heard the Bose system in my then-brand-new 1998 Nissan Maxima, I was thrilled. Fantastic, accurate bass and highs. Alas, my 2001, also with the Bose system, was way milder and blander. My current 2005 Maxima also has the optional Bose system, and what a disappointment. Where'd the bass go? Why so much mid-range? So, I shouldn't be surprised when I listened to the Bose Triport headset. Nice sound. Bass? Nary any. Midrange? Plenty. Highs still silky smooth, but impossible to balance without an equalizer. Big disappointment... they don't sound as good as my $50 Phillips set. Back they went and I took a blood bath in shipping fees, recouping about 2/3's of what I paid. Glad they are gone, and no Bose product shall be purchased until they learn, once again, how to create a good, accurate bottom end."
5,Awesome product!!!!,"I bought this to start my dreads out and it worked awesome!!! My hair is very thin, light brown, and just straight down to my butt. I had a friend help(you will definitely need someone to help you). She separated my hair in about inch inch and a half squares all over my head. Then back combed it with a flea looking comb I also ordered. Until it made the dreads. About 3 and a half hours later I had a head full of dreadlocks. I used dread wax every so often to keep it manageable. I would highly recommend this dread wax as the best for dreads and keeping them looking awesome!!!!"
1,Not All Computers Recognize This,"After purchasing this item, I found I could not get my computer to recognize it. There are no drivers available for it, and after some research, I found this was a common problem with this item. I also tried it on my father's computer, with no luck."
1,"Didn't work, had to return it","This is a simple product: it either allows you to use older peripherals with modern USB-equipped PC's or it doesn't. In my case, it didn't. I tried it with a single ""Dell"" (actually IBM) keyboard and three different PCs: a Gateway desktop, a Lenovo ThinkPad, and a Fujitsu P-7000 series notebook. It didn't work on any of them, even after rebooting. Oh well. (Amazon refunded my money)."
1,Hit or miss on whether it will work,"Some people seem to be able to get this product to work on their computers, but I was unable to get any of several computers with Windows XP to recognize a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite.If you can get it to work for you, it's a great deal at only a few dollars. Otherwise, be prepared to return it to Amazon."
5,Very nice Cartridge for $100.00,"This is a very good Cartridge for $100.00. On the grand scheme of things its not much at all.I have a pro-ject turntable and this Cartridge really does bring out the details of vinly. I was using Denon Dl 110. This was a very good cartridge as well. In my opinion the AT440MLA is more accurate, sound stage bigger, and a bit brighter.It's really so subjective - isn't it all? In any event, this is a very good cartridge, do not hesitate to buy. I've also heard that the Denon DL 103 is an excellent cartridge as well. I haven't heard it, but the reviews are excellent, and had I known about it - I may have opted for the DL103."
5,Audio Technica AT440ML cartridge,"This cartridge sounds great. The highs, midrange and lows are very clear. It tracks great. I would buy this cartridge again."
2,Disappointing,"This review is entirely subjective; I don't have any technical details to share. I originally became interested in this cartridge based on the positive feedback I had read about its predecessor, the AT440. Actually, I ordered the AT440, but was shipped an AT440MLA as the earlier model was discontinued.Having spent 3 years with this cartridge, I can say I wholly agree with the criticism that it offers clear sound with an unfortunate excess of high-mid and treble frequencies and borderline inadequate bass response. I've played many records with it, mostly rock/soul/funk and electronic. If you're looking for a fat sound to complement this kind of music, in my experience you won't find it in the 440MLA."
5,The taste of childhood,"When I was a child in Montana, my family would go out chokecherry picking -- not an easy thing to do, as I remember. My mother would make jams and jellies out of these wonderful berries. I was thrilled to find this product online and even more excited to find that it tastes exactly like my mother's jelly did! I've introduced this to many of my friends, most of whom have NEVER heard of the chokecherry, and they, too, absolutely love it."
5,Chokecherry Jelly memories of childhood,"I purchased Chokecherry jelly at Amazon.com.Your Chokecherry jelly has the same taste that my mother'sChokecherry jelly had.When all of her ten children ran around a farm in centralMinnesota, we were hungry when we came into the house forsomething to eat. My mother baked her own bread twice a weekfor her huge family. Us children would lather the Chokecherryjelly on thick slices of Mom's homemade bread.Reliving childhood memories through the sense of taste iswonderful.I would like to see this jelly in a larger jar.Please keep selling this Chokecherry Jelly I will be buyingmore.Let me know if Chokecherry Jelly is ever on sale.Sincerely, Inez Lintz"
1,poorly made,"I ordered this wire wok ring.The wire was broken in two places, and very poorly made.I was very disapointed with it.My husband said he could try to fix it, but I said it's not worth it, nor wasting my time sending it back."
5,Guitar Virtuoso,"I have seen Michael Kelsey live a handful of times. Every show offers something new and exciting. He is by far, one of the best performers you could ever hope to see.This CD will not dissapoint you, but you must see a live show to get the full experience."
5,fabulous soundcard for your laptop,"I got this card because I use my laptop all the time and I am also a music and movie maniac so I couldn't bear the poor sound quality from the integrated soundcard of the laptop. The card is thin, light, and easy to carry. And they even give you a sticker you can use on your desktop beside your XP and Intel labels. If you have a good headset, that's great enough for enjoying high quality music on your computer; and if you have a set of 2.1 or 4.1, the sound is unexpectedly amazing when you watch a movie. I can't imagine what my feeling will be when I get my 7.1 pieces, eventually.The card has digital output, but you have to buy additional cable to use optical signal. The same thing for digital input, but I don't think most people will use this function, since those professional DJs never work on a laptop. But you will be fond of Karaoke if you're an Asian. Cheers~~"
3,Disappointed,"I was really excited about this card until I finally tried it out. I have a Dell Inspiron 5150 notebook and when I run the card in high-perfomance mode, I always get a pop\click in the right channel everytime I play a sound file. Does anyone have the same problem? I'm on my second card now and it still has the same problem, even when I use it on a different laptop like an IBM Thinkpad T30.In the end, try the card out. It works fine for me in standard mode, especially because it does sound better than my on-board sound chip. However, its really annoying that I can't use it to its full potential in high performance mode."
4,she loves it,the ring is beautiful. its a bit smaller than i imagined but she didnt mind. i was kinda disappointed with the fact that the company wouldnt change the ring size and said if i did my warranty would be voided. but i had to since i was wrong about the size :(
1,Looks great - if it worked.,"I'm on my third hitch insert. The blue Ford logo light has failed on all three. The last one failed within five minutes of installation. The brake light on all three seems to work fine, but if you're interested in the blue Ford logo, forget it.Also, since this is entirely plastic, so if somebody bumps you while parking, even a light tap - it's busted."
2,"ok wok, not big of a deal","Order the wok and got it damaged (off-shaped). The packaging is horrible. Basiclly they put the bare wok in the box filled with the giant air bubbles. The wok can move around freely in the box. Guess the damage is caused during shipping.Return and reordered the Typhoon Carbon Steel wok, similar size and design, $3 cheaper. When I got it, I am very pleased with the quality:*) properly packaged, plastic cover on the top, sheet of paper on the bottom; fitted in a box designed for it;*) thick steel: 2.5mm rather than 1.8mm from joyce Chen;*) handles are welded on the wok, so no dead spot when cleaning;*) seasoning instruction are well documented, in 8 different languages, even thou I use my own seasoning way, not like joyce chen's one thin sheet of paper with not so clear instruction.overall, Joyce Chen's wok is like the one you can get from Chinatown supermarket, and Typhoon one is like from Macy's."
2,"Battery does not hold a good charge, other then that it works great",I LOVE this product however the battery does not hold a great charge. I would buy another one if needed.
3,Adequate - barely,"As other reviewers noted, this unit is underpowered, even though it has a higher volt rating than comparable units. With a little practice you can learn how to reduce the number of jambs when the blades of the ""Shrubber"" jamb on even small branches or items. The charging time is much longer than most items of the kind - 16 hours - but the unit then goes for a long time before running out of enough power to do light duty work. I use this tool for light pruning of small shrubs in remote parts of my property. I have no use for the shears and could not speak to its capabilities."
3,3 stars for how it works.....could have been 4 or 5 if it held a charge longer,"This product works perfectly for trimming where you would otherwise use a weedeater, with a lot less noise and a lot less hassle. My only dissappointment is that it only last about 30 minutes on a charge....thats pretty borderline. It also does a nice job of trimming my spiarrhea.The optional carrier makes it like a minny lawn mower and is a must if you have a lot of that type of trimming.It should have a lock on button but it doesn't, you have to hold it on all of time."
1,Piece of Junk,"We've had many trimmers over the years. These by far are the worst we've ever had.The problem is the design of both the grass shears and the mini hedge shears. They do not cut anything. They are dull and set too far apart to effectively cut anything.Plus for a 7.2 volt, which should be very powerful and have a long life battery this machine fails.I usually love Black and Decker items, but these were returned after 10 minutes of attempted use."
1,Greenies killed my beloved cat.,"My elderly cat loved these, so I gave him all he wanted. They blocked his intestine and caused his peritoneum to rupture. His intestines were floating all through his body cavity; I saw it on an x-ray at the vets. After watching him agonize in pain, I had him put down. It broke my heart."
2,Go to the pet shop,"Kitties love these, but found them much cheaper at the pet store. The product is great for cats, and their teeth, just the price online was more than getting them at the store."
4,More than you really wanted to know about life in the Navy,"They say the less you know about how laws and sausages are made, the better you'll sleep at night. After reading many of Poyer's books, I think I know too much about life in the Navy. Since I have no personal experience with the military, I can't comment on his accuracy with details. However, I can say that David Poyer is a powerful writer. His characters are very real, so much so that I'd like to slap a few of them upside the head. His descriptions of actions and environments are so vivid, I could feel the ship rocking in the storm, or the heat of the boilers.I appreciate the way that he often incorporates explanations for jargon and practices, without insulting my intelligence. My only suggestion for future novels is to include a glossary, and perhaps diagrams of the ships' interiors"
3,"80 percent fantastic, disappointing finish!","I couldn't put this book down for the first 300 pages. Gripping story, great characters, realistic depictions of navy life. Then came the attempt at courtroom drama, which to me, was a total waste of time. My advice is to read the book for the wonderful story, and then skip straigh to the Epilogue to find out how the court martial was resolved. You'll thank me for the hours of your life that I've saved you."
4,Almost As Good As the Original LG Battery,"Surprisingly, this LG VX8600 Replacement Li-Ion Battery works almost as good as the original one."
1,"Used, worthless battery",I bought this battery because my battery constantly died due to old age. The new battery I purchased must not have been a new battery because this battery also did not work. It was a waste of money! I bought a new battery from verizon and it actually worked.
1,Cheap Battery,"The battery is not holding the charge after a month. I charged at night and had to recharge at lunch time. Don't buy this product, becuase it is cheap. It is not a good buy."
1,bargaincel is terrible,"it took Bargaincel 11 days to tell me the battery they said was in stock wasn't and they had know idea when it would be. The website still lists it as 'in stock"""
2,NOT the Clint Eastwood song . . .,"The song on this CD is ""I Should Care"", not ""Why Should I Care?"", the Clint Eastwood song described in an earlier review. I just received it and it wasn't at all what I expected. This is the only complete song on the CD, and it was not the one I specifically ordered this for. It only has very short snippets of ""The Look of Love"" and ""Cry Me a River. This is just a Borders Books sampler CD with poor sound quality. Ordered it ""used"", although it was actually an unopened sample CD, and didn't pay much, but with shipping, it was a lot more than it is worth."
3,Not enough holes!,"This is a nice-looking colander, but not very functional. It could use more holes to drain more effectively, especially on the bottom. I drained some cooked veggies in it yesterday & there was a residual pool of water that wouldn't quite drain out. My trusty, but ugly, circa 1980 green Tupperware colander performs alot better. The more holes the better when it comes to a colander!"
3,RC: Empire,"Based on reviews of all three Robot Chicken Star Wars it seems many feel this series steadily gets less funny, but I personally think they get better. I will admit that I only started watching RCSW because of the Family Guy versions making fun of Seth Green and the show in general, so that was a promotional tactic that worked on me, but compared to the FGSW I don't think RCSW stands up well to it unless you're a bigger fan of the show than I am. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE SW fan, which between that and FGSW is mostly why I got the trilogy, and I like RC but it's not for everybody and basically I don't think it's really my cup of tea. If you're in the same boat as I am, a SW fan but only moderately enjoy RC, then I would say get this for your collection. Otherwise it all depends on personal preference. If you're not familiar with RC then watch a few episodes, or even the first RCSW, and decide from there."
1,Dry ribbons,the ribbon came in a timely manner.. but they must have been old because they did not work very long.. VERY DRY would not buy again.. My boss was very disappointed..
5,Great Wally West Flash Story,This is a great book for any Flash fans or anyone who likes the JL in general. I particulary enjoyed the interaction between the Flash and the other JL members. The author was also very talented at working in things from the Flash series (but still very readable if you don't know the Flash series). A great read.
5,Highly recommended!,"This fragrant bath set contains four wonderful products - a body souffle to moisturize and hydrate, a body scrub, a body wash, and a candle - each with that wonderful tropical scent. I love the way the bath products make my skin feel, and I highly recommend it to you!(Review of Bath Accents B A Bath Set, Coconut Lime , 1 bath set)"
3,A solid entry,"Well, not many people have heard of Bernard Henrik Crusell, but he wrote three clarinet concertos. His compositions aren't up to Mozart's standards, but few composers' concertos are. While not the best of classical concertos ever written, these three, particularly the 2nd concerto in F Minor, have a lot to recommend them. This is worth a listen if you've exhausted the standard repertoire and are looking for something new."
3,Not easy to season,"I guess this can be a great wok if I know how to season it right. I followed the instructions attached and checked out several websites on seasoning tips. But I still can't get the seasoning right. The wok is unevenly seasoned, everything sticks to it and a little seasoning comes off with each cooking. I wish I can see a correctly seasoned wok so I can tell what's wrong with mine. Also, the instruction says do not use soap to clean the wok after each use and I am a clean freak and likes all my cooking utensils squeeky clean. Anyway, I do not recommend this wok to novice wok seasoners."
5,The best of the best,"I have listened to Don Williams for over 30 years now. As far as I am concerned, he is the best of the best. I wish we may have country singers as good as Don Williams."
5,another of Don's best,"This is an excellant and enjoyable album with many of Don's lesser known and heard tunes.Somewhat surprisingly good, but if Don is one of your favorites, you're sure to be pleased."
2,Mediocre period piece.,"The directing and acting of this film are not up to the level promised by the theme. The character of Napoleon is gigantic, like a Patton, Nixon, Clinton at a minimum, and the understated and meandering plot of the film never takes flight. I really wanted to like it, but came away nonplussed. Sorry."
4,Napoleon at St Helena,This movie is French with English subtitles. It is about Napoleon being on St Helena and befriending a girl called Betsy Belcombe. It is an intriguing movie because there is a mystery coming to the end of the movie.
5,This is a great book.,It gives a good basic understanding of the policy process in Government. It doesn't pull punches as much as one would expect and it shows the evidence. Anything found in this textbook could be heavily reinforced with pages of references from Google Scholar. This has been one of the most interesting books I have ever used in College.
4,Beneficial to Any Policy Analysis Understanding,"Public Policy: An Evolutionary Approach provides straight-forward history on the evolution of undesrtanding of public policies to the evolution of approaches and models. I do not detect any bias in the material in the first two segments of the book. I did not spend sufficient time with part three describing the analytical approaches outlined to the case studies to weigh any idealogical bias. Nonetheless, for any policy analyist, this is an important academic book for political science and public policy. Any person involved in seeking to influence policy, engaged in policymaking, or implementation of policy, this book, in my judgment, is a required reading."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This book is worthless. Full of rediculous advice that will get you ""killed"" at the poker table. I tried some of these techniques and it ruined my game. If you need to get a book, get one from an actual poker player. This guy is simply a writer trying to sell some books. For those of you who said this book was great and improved your game... I have some land to sell you!"
3,A Beautiful Cookbook,So I immediately preserved a quart of lemmons which will be done in about 2 more weeks. A key ingredient in quite a few of the recipes. Other ingredients are not always readily available to me here in the PNW. Have tried only one tajine recipe so the jury is still out but so far I give it 3 stars.
1,"Sloppy, repetitive and untalented.","VNV Nation is a terrible example of the music i love. Their compostition is weak, repetitive and slow. The pentamiter of the lyrics does not match with rythym or bass. The vocals are slow sloppy and untalented. Listening to this vocalist is like listening to the jaw bone of a donkey being scraped along a chalk board in a wide hallway."
5,A MIX OF A SLOW WUMPSCUT,"NEVER HEARD ANY OF VNV NATIONS WORK. BOUGHT THE CD ON A TRIAL BASIS. LOVED EVERY MIN. THAT WAS PLAYED. DEFENTATLY A NEW SOUND THAT MUST BE HEARED. IF YOU BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WONT BE DISSAPPOINTED. A MUST HEAR!!!!"
2,Liked the sound... hated thelyrics,I like the sound. I trashed the CD because of the lyrics... did not like the implications and found it to be a little too disturbing.
2,Doesn't Work,Amazon replaced my first disk that didn't play with another that doesn't work.I have a 2-month old LG 390 that has played everything else I've put in it but won't recognize this format.
4,Follow the Sharks,"A William Tapply book that was missing from our collection. As he lived in a nearby town, we are trying for a full set of his books. This was a very good addition."
5,Eye opening!,"This book is a wonderful and honest guide to how we can see things from a Godly prospective. I find it to be fresh and unique to hear a Franciscan Priest talk about things of Buddist practice. He did not shame them or say they were going to hell, he talked about how we too can learn from other religions. God Bless him for his honesty."
5,Great eye opener,"Growing up in a fundamental Christian home and attending a conservative church,I was at first hesitant to read such a ""out there"" book by a catholic none the less. But it being recommended to me by my counselor as the middle road between the eastern way and the western, I was intrigued. I was so refreshed and renewed in my walk with Jesus to see Him as one who loves all and wants to be reconciled to all, no judgements. The Eastern way of looking at life used to frighten me but after this book, I feel more open minded and walking down the road God wants me on. I have such a new appreciation for the Catholic religion and their view of who God is. I reccommend this book to any who are searching for more of who God is."
3,"Jumbled prose, bursting with insights","Father Rohr spoke at the tiny parish where I worship with my family in the mountains of NC. He is a dynamic and engaging speaker. The challenges that he imparted in that sermon had a remarkable impact on my young and reaching mind.With that said, this book reads like a long and windy sermon of a much weaker calibre than the one preached in NC. If this book were a dinner entree, it would be fusion cusine with spices that do not complement each other. However, taken on their own in small doses, they make for a delightful accompaniment.With patience, this book is rewarding. Rohr has keen insight into spiritual matters. Yet, I cannot give it more than three stars due to its poor organization, and rambling delivery. Lastly, one of the biggest problems is Rohr's effort to characterize Westerners as vapid and incompetent regarding spiritual matters, which I found to be simply tiresome and noxious."
1,Everything Belongs.....,"I didn't find anything worth taking away from this book. It was not instructive concerning prayer, lots of ""loose"" psycho-babble, presents itself as ""christian"" while embracing all sorts of non-biblical ideas, and no real theme that resonates thru out. Disappointed."
2,To be read with a couple of grains of salt...,"I find it extremely difficult to recommend a book that states an upside down pentagram is the symbol of Santanism.This is a good book to start with only if you want to know what you should research. Each chapter and subchapter barely grazes the surface of the subjects. The section entitled ""Kitchen Witch or Pagan Goddess?"" reads like a bad essay by a grade school student. However, a responsible reader will make a notation to further explore this subject and probably find much more relevant information elsewhere. Those who close this book and feel they are ready to present themselves as witches to the world is akin to an antheist reading an article on the New Testament in the morning and expecting to be ordained by the end of the day.Bottom line, you should only come away with a stirred interest in learning more on the learned arts rather than the confidence to start casting spells at whim."
1,Not what I wanted,"I ordered these ribbons because they were labeled 'Nu-kote"" which is the name brand I was after. However, I was very disappointed to open the package and discover a generic brand was sent to me. I have not had good luck in the past with generic calculator ribbons which is the reason I spent extra time trying to find the Nu-kote brand. I feel completely mislead and dissatisfied with the transaction as well as the product."
3,"Ok... not the best, but...","Not the greatest film any of the participants made, but has a gutsy feel to it. Similar to other 'revenge' movies... George Kennedy does what we all would do, were it not for the thin veneer of civilisation. I confess, I like this move, despite the shortcomeings. Rare, interesting, but dont spent too much money on it!"
4,Great Vacuum for Hardwood Floors,"I was looking for a vacuum for our hardwood floors. We have a 2300 sq. foot home and the only carpet is on the stairs. I purchased a Miele vacuum for $1200.00 and it did an okay job. I'm sure the Miele would do a bang up job on carpets but their floor tool is lacking. This Dyson has a few problems such as it does not follow you, it viers to the left. I'm constantly trying to keep it from banging into walls and getting it unstuck from furniture corners. The wand also spins and trys to kink. Since I don't use the stow away feature there is no place to hook the wand. Other than that the vacuum power is great. It even picks up the little tiny black dog hairs that the Miele would leave behind. I like not having to buy bags. With the few problems that it has, I would still recomend this vacuum."
1,Could not believe how heavy the wand is and how awkward to use.,I am handicaped and ordered this machine for me to use. We already own the animal one and love it but I can not use it with my breathing. I thought this canister one I could pull around and would not be that hard to use. It is heavier to try to use than the animal and the wand is so awkward to try to dust with and also extremely heavy. It cleaned beautifully but could not use it myself. I returned this one and bought the new slim 18 model and I can at least use it. Dyson need to redesign this one so it would not be so heavy in the wand and the floor attachment.
2,How the Master tells it!,"Although the publisher mentions this as being an original work of Yogananda, one should keep in mind that the master Himself revised and improved many of his writings in the final years of his mission, when he was even more advanced. Therefore, the Best is yet to come!"
2,"No Heat, No Flavor","First let me say that I just got an order in of 5 different spices, all are great except the cayenne, I do allot of cajun cooking and know cayenne very well, I have been using the no salt cajun mix for almost a year now and it is as good as the mixes I get in Louisiana ( Tonys ), I wanted to get some cayenne to bump up the heat for marinades and was disapointed with this product, has more of a parika taste than a pepper taste. If it was a prime item I would return it."
3,Mediocre,"The book didn't impress me much. It was sort of plotless and mindnumbing. It was something that helped kill time. I've definatly read books that were way worse, but it's not a book I'd reccomend to a lot of people. The whole story could be sumed up in a tenth of what it took to read. And I couldn't relate to any of the characters, because the ""all-american"" girl Mandy is does not exist, the ""sporty/tom boy-new girl"" is such a sub character in most every teen book it's sickening, Debbie's slut role in realy life would not have been best friends with Eva's total nerd. And I do not care how perfect Riley is supposed to be, if he had been so ""I'm waiting for marriage"" he wouldn't have made out with Debbie, because abstinate people are used to saying no in the heat of the moment. The whole book is pretty lame, but if you need a couple hours to zone out, this will help you do it."
5,Stupendous,"If you appreciate the finest in saxophone playing, jazz composition and distinctive orchestras, then you MUST MUST MUST listen to this unique album. I first saw Odean Pope play with Max Roach about 25 years ago in Chicago and was utterly amazed at Pope's technical command of the instrument (he is by far the master of circular breathing). Then I was utterly astonished when I heard a recording of his Saxophone Choir about 12 years ago - and I have always been a huge fan of the World Saxophone Quartet. Given the paucity of Pope on disc, the jazz world is in for a thrill with this live album from a date at the Blue Note (I wish I had been there). The only quibble is that a number of the pieces have been recorded by Pope's Saxophone Choir before, but that's a bit like complaining that Ellington recorded ""Take the A Train"" too often!! Besides, the personnel on these versions is the best ever."
1,I wish they had negative stars!,"Use caution when ordering any plans from Frank Betz. The roof designs will leak over time! Once you order the plans and can see this, Frank Betz will not refund your money. They do not offer study plans (wonder why). They are all advertising and hype!"
2,Blues masters 1 Urban Blues,all tracts were great except for # 17 which skipped and it was the reason I ordeered the CD in the first place....
2,Loose handle,"The carbon steel itself is ok however both handles are poorly attached with rivets and are loose. The long handle should have 4 rivets securing it. I was afraid welding on such thin material might burn through so I got some high temperature cold weld and sanded the hand attachment and applied the weld. The handle now is secure for the time being. Disappointed, could have been much better product with a little more attention to design."
4,It All Comes Down to Compassion,"""That Which You Are Seeking Is Causing You to Seek"" is a book about finding, realizing & using the compassion we already have within. It's about realizing the mental & physical violence we create for ourselves & other's, and choosing to stop it. It's about listening to our self-talk, and choosing to realize when this ""mental chatter"" is not truly benefiting us - when it's wrong - when it's judgmental - when it's hurtful; and then to realize our personal power to change what we think/hear/say, and how we behave/act.This is a wonderful book that includes many great insights - Although I must admit that I don't necessarily agree with all of the Zen-Buddhist thoughts included here, but then again, how do we learn about ourselves & other's if we read only those works that we are in full agreement with?...Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in spirituality &/or compassion - I think it has a lot to offer."
1,Terrible,Terrible! Absolutely terrible! (Apart from one story called Children of the Emperor by the only writer on there with any talent - Barrington J Baley).
5,One of each size!,"I would recommend getting one of each size. I have small hands and bf has large ones. Since we are both active in treating our 9 week old pup, having one of each size has been very beneficial. :) Highly recommend!***UPDATE***: 4-29-09 I have been using the small in puppy classes and in our class we play a game called pass the puppy while the owners are in a sitting position. I like the ability to 'lock' the treats up in the tote so other noisy pups cannot get in their and steal 'em :) I have used it with jeans and spandex pants with no issues with the clip keeping it on. I have even jogged/run with it clipped on and it stays perfectly! Great buy!"
5,Treats so much easier to reach,"I always bring treats with me when walking our dogs. It helps divert them from distractions like other dogs, people, trucks, etc. This treat bag has been extremely easy to use and very handy. It clips either to the fanny bag or to my pants in a flash. The opening is wide enough for me to easily stick my hand in to grab treats quickly. The bag is very sturdy with a nylon interior which makes it easy to sponge out. There's enough room inside the large bag to hold a lot of treats so I only refill the bag once in a while.When I get home, it's easy to unclip and close the top of the bag. This allows me to throw the bag into the dog cabinet without fear of spilling treats everywhere.Definitely a really good buy. I'm extremely pleased with how well this bag works for us."
3,"Good, but mine doesn't close",Its a nice product. It is very easy to use. It was a little annoying that it doesnt close all the way. I think I got a dud :(. But it is still nice to have.
2,Not for anyone pregnant!,"This is really a case study on post-partum depression, not a scary thriller. If it was not so BLATANTLY misadvertised, it probably would have been a better movie. I don't recommend the movie, but I recommend it even less if you are pregnant or a new mom!"
4,"Good Accessory for Traveling, but buy elsewhere.","This is a good product, and very useful if you visit foreign countries.I bought this item at an office supply store for a whole lot less."
5,Pretty useful !!,"This is very useful addition for Palm for people who travel internationally. Unless you are someone who travels to all the corners of the world, you may never use some of the plug adapters. I particularly like the hotsync cable. I can use it for syncing the Palm with my notebook.Comes in a neat pouch too."
1,JUNK - Do not waste your $$$,"We purchased THREE of these cables (over a 2-year period) for our church. Purchased at a Best Buy local store, not through Amazon. ALL THREE of these cables have been JUNK. Right out of the box, they have a bad internal connection (within the strain relief, at the 1/4"" jack end), so that whenever you wiggle, twist, or move the cable, you get LOUD pops, cracks, static, etc. At first, we thought the jack we were plugging it into was bad, but trying it on other devices showed it was the cable, not the jack.Hosa has a ""lifetime guarantee"" - they will replace the cables (if we ship them to California at our expense) with new ones! A fat lot of good that will do!Don't waste your money on these poor, CHINESE-MADE cables. Three strikes and we are OUT!!"
4,Pretty good guide if you want to be to tell what you saw on or off trail,"I bought this guide as we kept running into various snakes or salamanders while geocaching. It seems pretty complete. I just wish it had more pictures for each species, as the snakes sometimes look different in different stages of development."
1,Not sound,Wrong notes everywhere. Not particularly musical. The only good thing is having the opportunity to hear all the songs. They are glorious.
3,Not powerful enough,"The case is pretty neat, and very fashionable. However, these mints are tiny and don't have much kick. Overall, not worth buying a second time. Do check out the new Vojo Extreme mints, though, as those are in the same league as Penguin and very tasty."
4,Good Online Poker Book,"I read this book after I began playing online poker. And I found it very truthful except I rarely run into much chatting maybe I have just avoided the sociable tables. This book is not a strategy book, it justs give you an insight into the online poker culture. Read this book along with a good strategy book and winning in low-limit online poker will be literally!!! like printing your own money. I only play up to the $2/$4 point above that level the players are not as ignorant. However, you can get beat down on occasion from a overabundance of bad players who catch lucky breaks repeatedly on the river. This book kinda gets you mentally prepared for that so you won't go on tilt.Thanks to WSOP there are many sheep out there to be eaten. Read up and enjoy the feast."
1,Worst Poker Book EVER,"I read this book in one week and I don't feel I got any useful information! This book really isn't about what cards to play or how, but rather planning a session in the most elementary way (IE: are you going to play for 4 hours or 2?).I was completely bored and found myself feeling ripped off and trying to find the receipt...maybe I could take it back?Keep looking for that special poker book! NEXT!"
1,Rambling irrelevance,"This book was a real disappointment. The first hundred pages are all about the difference between online and B & M poker, and how you will probably lose at internet poker. ""How to crush the internet game""? Are you kidding me? There are instructions on how to make a deposit for goodness sakes! This guy takes a simple point, and somehow beats a dead horse with it for 3 pages. Every hour I spent with this book is an hour I will never get back. So simplistic, it is ridiculous. Rambling philosophy and no hard and useful strategies...I guess he doesn't want anyone crushing the internet game! No fear of that if you count on this book as help!!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"This is cheaper than similar items and does the job, but the more expensive ones are better made and a little more comfortable. You get what you pay for."
3,For All Mankind,"Their second LP with eight bons tracks, Well puplished by RepertoireRecords and that means just 100% outcome. I enjoy this cd even betterthan their first, no hit singles on it but just plain music from guyswho puted their heart on it and wanted also to have some fun. SoI can recomand this to people who liked Chicory Tip, Vanity Fare and soon"
2,wizard scalp massager,"this particular scalp massager doesn't do what i thought it would. you cant seem to bend the forks the way you want them. i'm sure there are better ones out there, but i didn't really like this one."
3,Deceiving,"The head massage wizard is a god, as long as you aren't the one massaging your head. If someone else does it for you, it feels really good, but you doing it yourself just isn't as good. The copper wire things will break off, if moved constantly, but that shouldn't be a problem. Overall I think it's a good deal for you money."
1,"Superfluous. Save your money and buy the new ""Witch Trials""","The show is okay, but it's available in its ENTIRETY on the second disc of the latest ""Live at the Witch Trials"" issue (which also includes about half of ""Early Years 1977-79""). Get the new ""Trials"", even if you've already got that album. It's priced about the same as this disc and you get real liner notes and a whole lot more (unless you really, really dislike the thought having to flip to track 9 to get past the BBC sessions)."
4,"This guy used to go by the name ""Sean D.""","I remember this guy. I have his first CD ""Ballads from the Heart"" which I bought 3 years ago. His 1st CD was really good. But this one is totally killer. This guy has one of the most perfect voices I have ever heard. Since I also like guitar a lot, the intricate passages he plays on his guitar along with his voice just explode with feeling and passion. I am so glad I have this CD. This guy is beyond talented. His music makes me feel like I can overcome anything. I hope everyone gets the opportunity to hear this CD. I am so glad that good real music is still around. Yeh!Vanessa Simonetti"
3,Okay... I Like.,"A couple things that you will notice:- Not shielded with a metal case = you cannot fix the wire if it becomes defective.- Not wrapped like an audio cable should be = you get a weird cable pattern. Looks ugly.- Good grip when plugging the XLR into an input jack. Solid.Not the best, but it can come in handy."
4,placing Yeshua in the proper context,"THIS IS A WELL NEEDED WORK, THE BOOK CONSIST OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT WRITERS, THE MOST NOTABLE BEING JACOB NEUSNER AND BRUCE CHILTON. WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT BOOKS BEING WRITTEN ABOUT THE ""HISTORICAL JESUS"", AND MOST OF THEM ARE INACCURATE, THIS BOOK OVERALL PLACES YESHUA IN THE PROPER CONTEXT. IT SHOWS THAT HE WAS CERTIANLY PRO TORAH AND FOLLOWED THE WRITTEN LAW TO THE TEE. WHILE MOST OF HIS ARGUMENTS WITH THE PHARISEES WERE IN A RABBINIC CONTEXT, AND THE REASON OF THE RUBUKES GIVING BY YESHUA TO THE PHARISEES WAS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THIER IGNORANCE OF THIER ON ORAL LAW, WHILE YESHUA HAD MASTERED IT. THERE IS ALSO A GREAT SECTION WRITTEN ON JAMES BY BRUCE CHILTON."
1,More fiction by a kriptorabbi,"This book is written by the same author of the fiction book ""Rabbi Jesus"". One of his co-authors is Rabbi Jacob Neusner, therefore you can expect Judaism's Propaganda instead of facts. Bruce Chilton is the same author that called Jesus a ""Mamzer"" in the book ""Rabbi Jesus"". I happen to know that Jesus is not missing!"
5,Love this Tool,"I've got a 40 year old MGB (old British Sports Car) and electrics are the bain of my life.This gives me quick, easy, and simple diagnosis.The LCD readout is good but then being able to supply power or ground at flick of a switch as well as create a load (via inbuilt breaker) is great.Seem my review and more comments here :-http://diary-of-mgb.blogspot.com/2011/01/power-probe-iii-aka-light-sabre.htmlCheers,Richard B."
3,Power Probe,I have yet to use it as I'm still studying on it. It does look rather useful and was recieved in a timely manner. I like it and plan to make use of it soon.
4,Kids Love It,"Kids really seem to enjoy this one. As a foster parent, I see that a lot of the kids that come into my home lack the ability to sit and concentrate on anything. But this video seems to hold the attention of most of them. I've had a couple boys that were more interested in going out to play soccer in the yard than to watch television, but for the rest: they loved it. They sat with rapt attention. The sea creatures ares so colorful and different and the video throws in scenes that makes them laugh. For example, there is one scene where a big waves splashes a man and when the waves pulls away you can see him tugging his shorts up and you see just the tiniest bit of his [...] and the kids think that is so funny ('cause that sort of thing happens to every kids once in a while and they can relate). The video shows such interesting creatures that it really opens up a whole new world to many children - a world hey never knew existed. Also, the songs in the movie are really catchy."
1,Not what i expected,First of all the holes for the pennies were too small so it was like impossible to get then putsecound i kept trying and ended up ripping the bookthird the book is cheaply made im upset with this purchase
2,Just doesn't last!,"I've had a 500 gal pond for 15 years! I use these because they are available locally. This is important because they fail so often. I've sent 3 in for failing under warranty, but this is such a hassle. I've now gone through about 12 of these. They just don't last. They either just stopped working (ice in the pond), or trip the breaker because they are water logged. I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, it very seldom freezes here, so they are only use 2-3 months a year. I'd suggest another brand, they seldom last more than a year! I have another brand (exposed elements) which I've used for ""backup"" for 10 years, with no problems. I just don't like the exposed elements."
5,"One of the finest ""Penny Dreadfuls"" ever written...","Every time I read this, I find some new little tidbit to enjoy. If you were discouraged by the movie, I implore you to pick up the source text to find out what went wrong. This is an excellent story and a great tribute to early 20th century adventure fiction.I really like this book."
5,A nice blend of anti-heroes,"This is a great story set in the late 1800's. Campion Bond recruits 5 people to perform a special mission. Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Dr Jekyl/Mr. Hyde, Mina (formerly Harker) Murray, and the invisible man. The five are sent to capture the cavorite, an anti-gravity device that allows flight to vehicles. But they soon learn they have been betrayed and now have to save London.The characters go perfectly together. Mr. hyde is just a savage ape, the invisible man is insane, Captain Nemo hates everyone, Mina is annoying as hell, and Quartermain is addicted to opium.This book is perfect except the conclusion seems too short. But none the less you should read it."
5,Heroes and Villains,"Alan Moore is probably the best writer in the comics industry today. With this series, he has come up with another winner. As many of you have no doubt heard, it features a team of heroes (and villains) from Victorian fiction. It is all brilliantly written, and Kevin O'Neill's artwork compliments the writing perfectly. This is a must buy for any serious fan of the comic book genre. I also think that many people who don't normally read comics will like it, too."
5,"Great Condition, love Alan Moore","The book arrived within a reasonable time period and in great condition! The edges of the binding were a bit bent, if we're being nit-picky, but you can never expect a used book to be immaculate."
1,illegible,If you're trying to read this on your phone then forget it. The print is far too small to read and nothing you do can improve it
4,La ligue sous un autre angle,"L'histoire de cettte bande dessiné n'a rien avoir avec le film. Les personnages comme Allan Quatermain, Capitaine Nemo, L'homme invisible, dr. Jekyll et Mina Murray sont présents mais dans une histoire et un contexte différents. c'est ce qui donne son charme. Bien dessiné et bien imaginé, on en vient presque a préféré cette BD qu'au film mais il ne doit y avoir aucune comparaison car les deux oeuvres font leur histoires sur a peu près des bases différentes.En résumé, très bonne histoire illutrée de faon magnifique et l'histoire nous surprend d'un bout a l'autre par les habitudes plus choquantes qu'on ne montre pas au grand écrant."
3,"Good idea with potential, but poor execution and content","The idea is fantastic.Take noticeable characters from other novels and smash them into a single novel, as a SWAT team.To really appreciate the content, I think that the reader must have read the actual books (novels) Dracula, Captain Nemo, Jekyll and Hyde, and Sherlock Holmes, at the very minimum.However, we are no longer in the age of weekly of monthly magazines.If I am buying a GRAPHIC NOVEL (not a comic book) I expect to buy the whole novel that brings the story line to closure.This volume 1 really does nothing else than introduce the characters, and not even all of them.Unless you have read Bram Stoker's Dracula, you would not know why the lady character in the book is so important and special. Or even who she is! (Jonathan Harker's wife) I would have liked this volume 1 to have more content, because I have no patience to hope to buy 7 or 8 volumes to get the whole story."
4,The League of Extraordinary Gentelmen,I really enjoyed this series. It was much better than the movie and showed the growth of Quatermain that was quite enjoyable.The second series was also very good.Leon
5,fun stuff eh..,"I won't bore you with a summary of the comic because there are so many already up here, but i just wanted to say this is just a good old fashioned ... comic. It's really fun stuff, alan moore never looked better. The charcters are intersting and a lot of amusing mentions to the backgrounds of the literay inspired charcters. It might be confusing for those who don't really know literay figures, but don't worry the art and makes up for it. Actuallly i'm really annoyed with the way they're doing this in the movie that's going to be coming out. Read the the comic before you see the movie, so you can join me in being [mad]. Psh.. adding Tom sawyer and dorien grey..Thats! that's?!!! WTH man??? You know they changed the name of the invisible man from griffin to skinner??!! Also what's this with making sean connary the leader of the group where it's presumed that miss murray is the leader in the comic??!! grrr.."
3,Moore's light-hearted adventure book,"When a device capable launching the incredible possibility of an aircraft is stolen from the English in 1898, her majesty assembles a very speacial task force to recover the device before the empire faces the horrors of arial warfare. The team consists of characters Moore borrowed from Victorian literature including Captain Nemo, Alan Quartermain, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. The book parodies Victorian literature, its bloated languege, its high-flying romaticism, its characters' pollitical incorrectness and obvious sexual hang-ups. While the tale is amusing and somewhat enjoyable, I think it may be too light-hearted to display what a compelling writer Alan Moore can truly be. To discover that, I point you to Watchmen, V for Vendetta or From Hell"
1,Incorrect Harness,"This is the wrong harness. It does not fit my 2005 audi at all, and even the package says it is for volkswagon. I want my money back."
4,As expected,"Many complained that item doesn't come with a protector to keep ink from bleeding through, which is a valid complaint, but easily remedied."
2,So Close...,"April 23, 2008 - I saw this disc online and noticed that there was a track done by one of my favorite bands... MINT CONDITION. I instantly began to order the disc when I read that only ""some"" of them have that version on it. Needless to say I called amazon's customer service to inquire that if indeed I ordered it I would get the version that contained MINT CONDITION. Wouldn't you know that when it arrived... NO MINT CONDITION track! Needless to say I was a little steamy. So I called customer service again to explain what happened and to inquire why I didn't get the version that contained MINT CONDITION. Their explantion was that the ""version"" that contained ""it"" were ""IMPORTS"" and that they don't have anymore.Truly disappointing...on a disc that for me would have elevated from good to Great."
4,Air intake needs better range,"I love to use a wok for stir frying and finishing a good pasta dish, since I love garlic and spices, doing it outside is even better. Burner is great, assembly is ok, (not a handyman by any stretch, so it to me 2 tries to get it right).The air intake, though, does not allow for reducing the air mix enough for an efficient burn, and at times it even extinguishes the flame. I have solved this with some aluminum foil but need to create a more permanent solution.All in all it gets the job done and will make for many great dinners."
1,Junk,"Very poor design and construction. Main issues are that it's not very stable, the burner bracket will bend easily and break at some point and the unit has a very uncomfortable height to work. It was so bad that I returned it to the local major brand name national outfitter the following day before I even fired it up.A much better constructed and designed product is the Portable Kahuna Burner XL unit. Although about the same price, it does not come with a wok (which I already had)."
1,Amp went bad too,I too had all the problems mentioned with the Amp. Mine failed within the first year. I sent it back for service. It worked for a while and then failed again ... this time outside of warranty. It sounded good when it was working. I'm considering purchasing an aftermarket amp from a 3rd party to get it running again. I wouldn't pay too much for one of these due to the frequent failure rate.
1,Do not buy this subwoofer.,"Same problem here...loud Harley Davidson motorcycle noise emits from subwoofer when amp is off. Had it ""fixed"" under warranty a few years ago. Now it is dead again. Sounds like it is not worth fixing. This type of speaker ""should"" last longer than six years. Never again will I buy from Infinity/Harmon Kardon."
1,"Infinity Powered Subwoofer, BU120","Great subwoofer when it works but fails with a steady, loud, annoying burst of 120 cycle thumps. Infinity is know for great speakers, I have an entire surround sound system built around them. I cannot understand why they would jeopardize theirname based upon a poor design which really stresses the components or a good design that uses marginal components. Note! I am an electronic's engineer.... You would think that they would send out an announcement about the problem and offer a work around or recall the unit and offer something new. Too bad. Based upon the reviews and the bad luck I've have, it looks like I have to find something different."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"I have craved the flavor of eating black walnuts for years, so I placed an order here when I saw them available. I was disappointed at the stale flavor and lack of the slight, sweet cherry taste at the back of my palate that I remember when eating these as a child.The price was not inexpensive for this experiment either!"
2,Interesting book - BUT...,"...Interesting book, worth to read by anyone who is seriously interested in Amelia Earhart's fate, but alas too much incorrect in many details, both technical and historical, so probably cannot be recommended for ""unprepared"" reader. Some claims are controversial, some picture captions are doubtful or just wrong, some statements in text are factually guesses without factual support etc. Especially sad is this repeating of old bizarre rumor about some alleged connection as if existed between Amelia Earhart and Japanese wartime broadcaster ""Tokyo Rose"" - pure myth that was debunked on a strict factual base since long ago. The book certainly includes some interesting material, but the biggest problem is to separate it from guesses and allegations of different kinds."
2,re-what?,"This Louis Jordon disc may have been remastered but that don't mean a thing even if it got the swing.This disc sounds terrible, not even good enough for the car on a rainy night. Has a good selection ofwell known Jordon tunes but the quality of the sound reproduction is just terrible. Best thing one cando with this disc is cover it with stick-on felt and make a coaster out of it---that poor! I will bet""Jasmine Records"", ( the producer/ distributor ) $1000 US dollars that Amazon offers at least 5 other discs that sound vastly superior to this unit. Stay way away from this one!"
2,Great when its working,"I will keep this basic. It does great with pptp. and ipsec. Internet speeds are fast, setup is easy and it has plenty of features. Every once in a while (sometimes a week sometimes 5) it drops the vpn tunnels and just basically shuts down and has to be restarted. On top of that, you have to restart is about 3 times. The alert light blinks and sometimes one restart isn't enough. We had a replacement sent from 3com, but the new one does the same thing just less frequently. We have 3 in 3 different offices, and they all need infrequent restarts. So we're looking for a replacement before we open office #4."
4,good for kids to learn about...,Enjoyed using this book to teach kids about environment & art. It helped me weave field trips to the park into art projects in the class room.
5,A great introduction to immunology,"This book is a great introduction to immunology. Many other immunology books have too much information to absorb, but this book is as brief as possible without sacrificing clarity. I especially liked the review questions and ample references at the end of each chapter."
3,"Outdated, but stull a great sourcebook for the Palladium game system","Expanded inventory of weaponry, for use with any palladium game system. As well as tables for deviding up hitpoints/sdcs to various parts of the body."
4,Very useful to hill broken clavicle,"I have broken clavicle and it works very well to comfort and support it, but little bit uncomfortable underarm. I wish the stripes were little more narrow in the part that goes underarm area."
2,It's so-so...,This is really lukewarm tap and not much of a workout. I would recommend renting it from netflix first to see if you like it.
4,not as simple as it looks!,"i was really excited to start tapping.. and although i have previous dancing experience (but not tap) i still found this dvd very slightly challenging but fun..only get this if you are interested in learning to tap but not as a substitute for a real workout... its something in between high & low impact exercise, as its much more mellow than aerobics and slightly more energetic than yoga.. i use it to break the routine but not as a workout routine on its own."
5,Tap dance student companion,A great compliment to my beginning tap class. Would probably work well even if you weren't taking a class. Well organized and well done!
5,If you could only make it six stars!,"Like many of the other reviews, I decided to fulfill a lifelong dream - having never had a lesson in anything my whole life - I decided to take beginning adult tap dance lessons. The class was to fast paced, and I was constantly falling behing & getting frustrated, despite hours of practice. This tape is super, Bonnie helped make sense of the steps I was having trouble with, and it's great for practicing. If only she made more videos, I would really be a happy camper! It was worth every penny."
1,Awful,"This is an awful product. I used it on the ledge and rail of my balcony because of my pigeon problem. It immediately started to attract bugs and dirt. The birds avoided it for about two days then started landing again on the ledges and rail. After two weeks, it was an awful, unslightly mess. So how do you get it off? Pay another $20 to buy the solvent remover. I spent four hours scrubbing it off today and it's still not completely gone. Do not recommend using this product."
1,.,So we hired specialists to apply this stuff. A few hours later we found a hurt pigeon who fell off the roof because its body was covered in this stuff and it couldn't fly. Luckily a friend took care of the bird by taking him to the vet.
2,Lots of fluff and lousy pictures,"I had to put this book down. I found the content fairly obvious or at times questionsable in accuracy. The most annoying part was the illustrations which seemed to a collection of random clip art with connecting arrows. While the table of contents is impressive, I was very dissapointed in the content.I returned this book."
1,I can't believe McGraw-Hill published it,"The book lacks structure and depth- both from technology and business prospective. Half of the book talks about Internet technologies that have little relevance to M-Commerce.The book talks mostly about technology while strategy and other business issues are not addressed adequately. The author attempts to use basic strategy concepts (e.g., SWOT analysis), but their use is very inconsistent and rudimentary. Considering the amount of research and thought leadership published by Forrester, Gartner, PricewaterhouseCoopers, McKinsey, and a number of on-line publications, it is disappointing to see this book published by McGraw-Hill."
5,Hogmanay DVD,"This DVD is in excellent condition and arrived quite quickly. I'm so happy with it. thanks, Pat"
1,No impressed yet,I got this to help with litter box smell in my laundry room. We have had this plugged in for 3 days now and it's still the same smell as before. It just seems to push it around the small room more. We change the litter box at least once a day and even changed the type we use. This machine seems like a waste of money to me. I'm a little disappointed. I am hoping that I can so write a new review with a more positive message.
4,Air cleaner,I have two of these machines. I had to order them as I cant find them in any store!Im a smoker and I feel they do a good job of eliminating the smoke odor.It would be nice if I could find them locally. Along with the filters.I would recommend them highly.
2,Works only about one foot from plug,It is Not worth it. Does not even come with a smell packet. I would not recommend if you are trying to eliminate tobacco smoke
1,Maybe I'm doing something wrong,"I bought this after reading the great reviews. I have not used the scented insert thinking the filter can remove the orders. It does NOT!!! I have a very clean bathroom with a litter box in the bathroom. My cat uses the box once and it does not even remove the urine smell. I have better look covering the orders with a Yankee Candle insert that does not have a strong smell. I find this product to be a waste of money. Please note this is space is problem 5"" X 10"". So it's a very small space."
4,Works great,"This really removes odors from the house. If you use the tobacco filter, it really makes the air clean! I liked it so much I bought a bigger model and more of the tobacco filters. The nightlight is a little bright and it is blue. There isn't a separate switch for the night light so if you turn it on the light automatically goes on. I can hear it but the noise is really not that bad...now that I have had it for awhile I don't even notice it. I leave mine on all day and the filters last a pretty long time. I love how it tells you when to change the filter so you don't forget!"
3,I guess it work,"Gotten so used to the smell of my dog that it doesn't bother me anymore. I've been told by guests that it smells less like my dog so I guess it does work.Cons:Huge unit for a plugin90 degree ""fresh air"" vent (needs a good open space to really work)A bit noisyWould I recommend? For the price it doesn't hurt to try and from the word of friends and family it works."
4,Great Bonus Track,"Okay, truth be told, the movie is pretty much what you'd expect - decent animation and story telling, but not as good as the original feature. The bonus track, however, is probably the coolest bonus track I've ever seen (it's called ""Tarzan & Jane's Adventure Builder""). Strange to be saying this about one of Disney's B-titles, but it's true. It's a choose-your-own-adventure type story in which you get to decide what Tarzan should do. There are dozens of choices, and tons of different endings. I've played this track so many times and still can't believe how much new content there is each time. The production value on the bonus track is terrific - a rapid montage of stills that dissolve into each other, narrated by Tantor the elephant, set to a fully scored soundtrack. I hope Disney does more of these."
1,Sad excuse.,"This was a sad, sad film. This movie was given to me as a gift because I was so enamored with the original. Not only does this not stand up to the original, but it is just a poor film on it's own. The beauty of the animation is gone, the passion is missing, and the story is lack-luster. If you want to find out more about Tarzan, read theTarzan of the Apes (Signet Classics)books. The first two are wonderful."
2,Tarzan & Jane are back! That's supposed to be a good thing?,"Just another Disney failure. It was alright for a direct-to-video. But HARDLY worth the buy! The voices (except for Jane) are AWFUL! The animation is TERRIBLE! The movie looks like those Saturday cartoons that were recorded! Disney should be ashamed of themselves. The original Disney's Tarzan is a LOT better than this sequel. Don't buy it unless you have kids 9 or younger that will enjoy it. If you have Tarzan fans over the age of 9, don't buy it! They'll be disappointed. I was."
4,"If you have a sense of humor, you will like the reflections.","I thought that this was a book, but in fact, it is a collection of thoughts that women had about their divorces and living alone. There are only three to five sentences per page, but it is food for thought. Some of the reflections are bitter, some are humorous, and others are inspiring. It is on the order of Chicken Soup for the Soul, but without the stories. If you read between the lines, there is some good advice. I liked it, but it was only worth 99 cents."
3,Cute idea...,"As a die-hard Led Zep fan and a new mother, I saw this as a ""must have."" It's a nice idea, but some of the songs are really hard to recognize. My baby never really got into ""baby music."" I see it as more of a novilty item, my daughter prefers real music from a radio or cd."
3,Snoop please,only b please is dope anyother tracks are just average or wack i hate on u P u betta stop dat shhhhhhhhhhhhh
3,people who don't understand,first off let me say that this is a good album. but it wasn't by any shot great. next let me say to all those people who got mad at snoop because he didn't do alot of southern style rap on this: think about it he's from the west and probably should do a west coast style album. personally i think his rap style isn't up to the southern style rap since his style is too relaxed and down south rap is very up tempo. all in all though it was a good rebound from the first no limit cd even though u all out there shouldn't hate on it that much.
4,"Snoop's best since ""Doggiestyle""","THIS ALBUM WAS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I WAS VERY RELUCTENT TO BUY IT AFTER THE GAME IS TO BE TOLD CD, WHICH WAS PURE GARBAGE. HOWEVER, THIS WAS A TIGHT ALBUM, ESPECIALLY THE TRACKS DR. DRE DID. THE ONLY SONGS THAT SUCKED WERE THE ONES PRODUCED BY BEATS BY THE POUND, THE NO LIMIT PRODUCERS. SNOOP CAN STAY WITH NO LIMIT, BUT HE NEEDS TO LET DRE PRODUCE HIS MUSIC."
4,West Coast Bombay,"All I can say about this CD is, ""It's about time"". There's no question that ""Doggystyle"" was a masterpiece, but after hearing the last two records he put out, I wondered if Snoop still had it in him to deliver a quality album. I'm glad he brought his sound back home to the City of Angels.My favorite cut is probably, ""Betta Days"". I haven't seen the CD cover, so I don't know for sure who produced it. But I believe DJ Quik produced it. Quik's production fits Snoop's voice like a glove. I also like the Wild-West sounding, ""B-Please"".It was a nice change of pace to put Xzibit on the record. Dre produced another winner, and laid claim once again to the title of best producer of all time. I hope they pull it together like this again for Dre's new album.All I can say, Snoop, is Welcome Home."
5,THATS THE SNOOPDOGG I KNOW,I LIKE THIS ALBUM BECAUSE SNOOP IS GONING BACK TO THE STYLE EVERYBODY NEED AND HAS BEEN WAITING ON WHEN I HEARD THAT DR DRE HAD A COUPLE OF SONGS ON IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD SELL SO A MESSAGE TO ALL THE HATERS BACK UP BEFOERE YOU GET - - - - - - - - KEEP ON BRINGING OUT THE HITS AND NEVER STOP A MUSIC FAN FROM D-TOWN
3,hatin on some the best tracks on album,"this album is tight is really about a 3 1/2 but, why is every body hatin on the 2 tracks by beats by the bound. ""Down for MY Ni@@az is the rowdiest and krunkest track on here and Ghetto symphony is tight, the beat is average. Every body is forgettin that snoop doesn't have a down south rapper voice thats why his voice cant adapt to the hard hittin beats by the bound. I like tracks 4,7,8,9,12,14,15 and just dippin was alright."
5,Don't judge this album because of his last cd.,"Snoop,Dre,and DJ Quik are great together.Snoopafella is TIGHT.Everyone look out for Dre's next cd.\899"
4,"This is Snoop's most complete album since ""doggystyle""","Any fan of Snoop Dogg will enjoy this album it has a nice flow through the majority of the tracks. It truly takes you back to the early days of his career. A definite pick for your collection, you can't go wrong on this one."
3,not that good,"snoop dogg is not topp dogg of no limit.this cd is of. some good songs. best songs are buck em,down 4 my n*ggas,bitch please,symphony,and don't tell."
3,Great costume,I like the nude fabric to cover the skin areas and overall the costume seems to be made out of decent material but I noticed a ripped seem during the first wear trick or treating therefore I gave it a 3.
2,It's...Well...Ehhh....How's the weather?,I just couldn't motivate myself to finish this book. It's sort of like a bad date. You just want it over asap. That's my feeling with this book. I donated it to the public library.
1,Did not work,"This product did not work. I had an excruciating headache the first couple of days, and then it went away. I think if you eat poorly before using the product. Then start eating better and drinking more water, then yes you will feel better. But for someone who eats well and drinks more than 32 oz of the water, this is a waste of money."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Compared to Mogami and Monster, these cables are a steal. In fact, the only issue with them is that they don't last. The sealed ends mask the absence of quality in the connectors--the most critical aspect of any cable--and unfortunately within a few months of inputting, removing, inputting, etc, those ends begin to fail, thus compromising the integrity and utility of the entire length.For approximately 50 cents @ foot, this is probably a decent purchase to consider, versus the $3 @ ft. prices for Monster and Mogami--provided you are willing to consider these cables disposable and potentially a disruption at an unannounced time.You get what you pay for."
5,A wonderful book on practical spirituality,"In my opinion it is one of the three best books of Vernon Howard, the other two being ""The Power of the Supermind"" and ""Mystic Path to Cosmic Power."" It's a book plenty of practical spiritual insight."
2,Not a bad intro,"Covers the basic concepts well. However, if you're looking for something indepth, or need help with a complex installation, keep looking. This is a fairly thin treatment of thin client solutions."
5,Very good!!,"I bought this because Chris Noth and Edward James Olmos, two of my favorites, are in it. I love it! I was very pleasantly surprised by Noth's performance. I have seen him do some roles that were not particularly impressive. However, I can recommend this movie without reservation. Even though it's about 3 hours (it was two parts on TV), I didn't get tired of it. Sometimes I can't last through an entire movie if it's too long."
5,The writer's Bilble,"If you need a writer's guide , buy this one, no matter what you write or for which public. It's full of usefull and simple examples and exercises. The language is clear and humoristic. This book contens all you need to know about crafting unforgettable stories. I use it to rewrite my crime story manuscript and it makes rewriting something close to fun. And that is something unvaluable as you may already know. Buy this book, pick up your pen and join the creazy community of wannabe writers."
3,The Writer's Guide to Crafting Stories for Children,Found the book to be very easy to understand and applied. Simply a great book for aspiring authors of children's book. It also helps the future author to understand that writing for children is not an easy task as thought by many a tyro in this field.
2,A Spotty Treatment,"I very much regret the money I spent on this book. I need a primer on technical analysis, one that starts with the fundamentals and builds to some more complex illustrations. This book, however, is weakly organized and compels the reader to consult external sources for the gaps in its coverage of the topic. Much of the text is preachy, sounding like the hucksters pitching an investment scheme on AM radio. The author has either done a poor job of illustrating the method behind the calculations, or has incorporated several errors in the text. I suspect both.I looked forward to the charts, but they are not drawn intuitively, they do not support the text, and they are largely repetitive. It reads as though the author was getting paid by the page count. This one will be collected dust on my bookshelf."
1,"Dated Treatment of ""Tech Analysis Lite""","Much of this book contains some very tired theories on stock movements from generations ago. While stock patterns may have some historic trends, it is a gross oversight in failing to consider how computerized trading has affected both patterns and the timing of trades. This book would have had some use in 1975, but it will hinder the modern technical trader, who must compete with others using state of the art technology. And as others have noted, the text is rife with errors."
3,"More, more, more!!","I LOVE this lady she is so hilarious! I can't believe how brave she is - and she's so fast with her comebacks...I freaked out on her behalf when she told her story about what happened with her onstage with some idiot who's name I can't remember. Anyway, the only reason why I'm giving this a 3 is because there are only 2 discs and SIX episodes. 4 on the first disc, 2 on the 2nd and the stand-up show called ""Kathy Griffin is...not Nicole Kidman"" is on there to help fill up space but I was very disappointed to have spent $22 bucks on 6 shows and a standup act. Can't wait for the 2nd season!!"
4,Genre Guitar,These recordings are an excellant example of genre mixing music.Arthur Smith brings together Country-Western guitar playing with a strong Swing Jazz flavor. Aside from some obvious cliches and a little bit of corn these recordings are quite satisfying. Listen closely and you will hear a little bit of Django Reinhardt influence.
4,Loved it!,"I really loved this book. A three part story that leads you on a wild ride of adventure and intrigue. The characters are dynaminc and likable, the story flows well and best of all, it ends with a nice sense of closure while still leaving the door open for more books"
4,Nikita Blues,"This is a low budget bonus. Nikita Blues is the movie of choice and is difficult to find.If you enjoy ""Fatal Attraction"" type movies, give it look."
5,Great CD,"I first heard this album while on vacation, so I had to buy it, and I am very pleased with the purchase. The album is great. I'ts good jazz with a good uptempo beat to it."
5,tourist,"excellent ,smooth balance between jazz& blues will purchased their music again although this was an older cd it still fits todays modern trend of jazz"
5,A new twist on John Lee Hooker,The cut with John Lee Hooker (one of Blues undisputed kings) is fantastic and the original reason I bougth the CD. I was plesently supprised how much I like the rest of the CD and will buy more of this artist's work.
4,Acid Jazz Hits Home,"In a wonderfull colaberative effort, St Germain brings together a mixture of the UK's Massive Attack vs The Mad Proffessor, Adrian Sherwood/Primal Screams's ECHODEK, and Modern Jazz. The result is an amazing audio expierience good for listening at all levels. Be it in you home on the Hi-Fi, or in your car with the windows rolled down. St Germain definitly catches all of your audio interests and lets you expierience the wonderfully trippy and melodic tunes encased in this amazing CD. After only hearing a few of the tracks, I had made up my mind. This CD belongs in my collection along with all the other greats."
4,The french know their music,"It is impossible to listen to this album without tapping your feet. The beat gets into your veins just like a fix. This is Ludovic Navarres second effort under the St-Germain pseudonym, and the 5 year hiatus was sure worth the wait. Although not all tracks are as mesmerizing as say the opening track ""Rose Rouge"" with it's continual drum ""solo"" slowly morphing into a dancefloor house anthem or the incredible ""So flute"" which will have you pressing that ""back"" button until you get callouses on your index finger; all-in-all, this album is probably the strongest effort in the jazzy techno/house genre alongside the brilliant Amon Tobin.Be hip and get with the now... get this album! You won't regret it."
5,kewl,"Better than the lastest St Germain CD. Laid back, jazzy and classy soundz. Almost like vintage Masters At Work. Get this if you are into MAW, you won't be dissapointed."
4,Must-read for Eddings Fan,"If you are an Eddings fan, then the Malloreon is a must-read. Warning though - it's not as good as the Belgariad - then again, what is?"
2,He does it both times...,"As in, the Belgariad was all right, not too much gratuitous humor that isn't that funny thrown in. Then comes the Malloreon, and EVERY character has to be a wiseass. Even Cyradis, the archaic-speaking seeress, gets her share of stupid one-liners! This would have been a good read if only Eddings hadn't put in all the artificial jokes. Stick with the Elenium!"
4,"The last Robert, Michael and Monette book","Gay friends Robert and Michael and 6 foot lesbian Monette get involved with a CD-ROM that has some raw, incriminating pictures of people in various sexual positions. Somebody wants it back and is not above killing to get it.This is the fourth (and I'm pretty sure last) Robert/Michael/Monette comedy murder mystery. Like the other three it's quick, VERY funny and full of twists and turns that keep you guessing who did it. All the characters are interesting and you don't want to put it down. Unfortunately this is probably the last of the series. It has a VERY happy ending with Robert getting everything he wants. So...there's nowhere left to go with the character. Also this was published back in 2004 and author Robert Stukas hasn't done anything since. Too bad but at least we have the four books to reread again and again:)"
5,ballet class for beginners,This is a great beginner ballet dvd. I would recommend it for any ballet teacher's library. A great tool for student teachers!
3,Basics are covered but too fast paced.,"I have been taking beginner ballet classes and purchased this video to help me understand the steps, especially those I was having a hard time with. This video covered the basics as in class, but it moved way to fast. It is difficult to keep up with and even more difficult to have to rewind to go over steps. It requires time and patience."
2,beginner review,I am a true beginner in need of very thorough instruction at a slower pace than this dvd provided. If you have no experience at all with ballet than this dvd may move too quickly and not provide enough detail of each exercise to follow along with the movements. It may be better suited for active beginner's who are already familiar with proper form. I agree with other comments about feeling frustrated when I had to rewind for every movement to do the other side of the body.
1,Ballet Class for One Side Only,This is a ridiculous DVD as it only has class ON ONE SIDE OF THE BODY. It's insane to have rewind betweenevery movement to be able to do the other side. Nobody in their right mind should buy this; a total wasteof money.
2,Not impressed,"Would not recommend this to anyone, boring, the ""instructor"" is difficult to listen to and somewhat annoying. I would return this product... but seriously it is not worth my time."
1,"too many wires, out of date","This product is extremely annoying because it requires a huge power brick, 3 seperate cables, and the slow antiquated RS-232 serial connection to synchronize.Thank God there is a USB equivalent available now. Do not buy this, there are better alternatives available now. In my opinion, the Palm devices won't really be useful until 802.11 wireless synchronization is available."
1,This is the worst example of hip hop music,"This is an album that is bitin' from top to botton. Not only did they put out remixes and regular versions of old songs but they totally copied songs off of Snoop, primarily Snoopafella. C'mon Suge Knight! People need to wake up and see that this is a desperate cry for money and a quick fix with the multi-platinum title. It's all in the name. The content is trash."
2,NO PAC NO HIT,"PAC JUST BEING ON 2 TRACKS ON A DOUBLE CD JUST DON'T STRETCH THE SALES. DEATH ROW SHOULD BE ON DEATH ROW. PAC WOULD BE ASHAMED TO SEE HIS POETIC MASTERMIND LACED OVER SOME WACC TRACKS LIKE THESE. AMERICA DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, MORE IMPORTANTLY YOUR TIME. THIS IS A NO BRAINER AND WHEN YOU SEE IT LEAVE IT ON THE SELVES. R.I.P. 2-PAC AKA MAKAVELLI"
4,very practical folder,These folders are extremely practical and affordable for our company. They are durable and have plenty of room for employee information.
1,KEM's smooth jazz,"This album including the second one, does not do justice to the artist, KEM is a consumate artist that takes great care in the quality of his music, this album, with no indication of who the artists are that plays on this album and thE incessend sound of a lone SAX, is not KEM. I hope he will be more careful in who he allows to play or copy his music. KEM is an artful pianist, it is a distinct sound on his music, no piano solo's or even the sound of a piano on this albums, is a plain put off, I will not recommend this CD nor the second one and also the smooth jazz CD of Motown, what a awfull piece of music. Come on KEM, you should not allow this, and shame on Motown for even allowing this, or is it about the money and not the music, anymore. I have three CD's to donate, any takers?Smooth Jazz Tributes KemSmooth Jazz Tribute to Kem 2Motown"
2,Ribbon Candy,"I purchased this product quite awhile ago. The pieces of candy were broken when I received it. I put it in the freezer to keep for Christmas and now, I have it out and it's extremely soft, sticky and although it looks nice, I won't buy this again. Not worth the price for the taste. Maybe it's because I put it in the freezer?"
5,Casual City Rider,These tires are lasting a while on terrible roads in Richmond. I haven't popped a tube with these on other than hitting a giant manhole cover at speed. Good low cost tire. My friend swears by the Krylion tires but I have yet to see a difference between them except for the price.
3,This CD is a sleeper.,"When I first saw HELLBORN in the store I was hesitant because it looked satanic and demonic with the fire and the skulls. I decided to give it a try because a friend recommended it. After one listen, I knew this was a true underground group ready for mainstream. With production by JoTraxx, one of the hottest producers in the South, HELLBORN gives listeners a view of life in one of Jackson, Mississippi's most notorious hoods. Their message is clear. They want people to know hat life is really like in Mississippi. One song ""Do You Wanna"" is a 3-6 Mafia typre cut. The song is about people who do things in life that could cost them their life. ""What About It"" is a club song asking listeners what about the things that are going on. If you like 3-6 Mafia, you will definately be feeling these cats. They are representing Mississippi to the fullest."
2,why can't I fast forward,"For some strange reason, there is no way to fast forward without using the remote, and why would anyone want to carry along a remote to use the player while traveling on a plane or train?"
4,Lots of fun!,"Okay, if you're a fan of punk and new wave, you've probably got at least 6 or 7 of the 19 songs here scattered around your collection already, on Blondie, Ramones, and Television records. But if you're like me and have never heard the Dictators, the Heartbreakers, and several of the other less-famous bands here, you're in for a treat. And Patti Smith, who never appealed to me much, comes across well in the context of like-minded bands.If you know nothing about the mid-seventies NYC scene, then you owe it to yourself to check this out, especially if you're a fan of more recent styles of punk. Along with the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, the New York bands were touchstones for everything else that followed. Other DIY volumes are out of print, by the way, so you might want to grab this one while you can."
5,Most Awsome Musical Investment I Ever Made,"This has been the most rewarding little instrument I have owned. Cheap price for what feels the Authentic Thing. Only complaint is the bar that sticks out the back, which I use to brace the harp against my teeth, is kinda sharp. I fashioned a padding and now it is perfect! Well worth the minor expense if you are interested in this quirky kinda deep instrument. I learned from YouTube... well I figured out how it works there and then just went to town."
5,Some brief notes from the researcher behind the book:,"Please Pray For Us provides information about the 52 countries in the world where Christians are most persecuted. With each entry, the book gives a brief description of: the country, church life within the country (including an indication of the growth or decline of the church), current levels of persecution (as well as stories from the lives of the persecuted), and a prognosis for the likely future of persecution within the nation. Each entry also comes with a quick-review statistical box and a map of the nation. In the back of the book are addresses where you can get more information."
1,Goofy is sure the right title...,"I've been golfing almost my whole life, and I spend 1/2 the year in Ft. Worth, so I thought I'd love this book. Dallas/Ft.Worth really needed a good guide to the courses, and I even like listening to these guys on the radio. But...Boy was I disappointed.In short - the book reads like it was written by someone who never plays golf. It's more like a 4th grade kid had the assignment to write some funny golf stories. Except they're embarassingly dumb stories - not even funny. The book is trying so hard to be cute - but I don't really know any golfers that like ""cute"" that much. It's really cloying. For guys whose 'schtick' is telling supposedly embarassing stories about themselves, this book really IS embarassing.Maybe these guys are just better talking than they are in print - I'll still listen to them on the radio - they just don't 'sound' the same in the book. Maybe writing just isn't their thing.Dallas/Ft. Worth STILL needs a great guide to golfing there."
2,It's a lie,"I read a previous users review M. Romo. I didn't believe at first. I checked it out and downloaded the specifications, sure enough, the max for this product is 16 bit 48 khz. Half of what it claims. If you have computer speakers, with those wimpy satellite speakers (don't care how expensive) you won't notice, but connect it to a stereo with good speakers, makes a huge difference, if you have 24 bit 96 khz. Plus for laptops, I disagree, it isn't very portable. Plus it is only EAX 2.0 certified, can get EAX 3.0 externals for less. Plus the Sound Agent 2 thing, who cares, sound cards that can distinguish your speaker setup is standard, nothing special at all. Honestly I don't think it is worth the money, especially when its a lie"
5,Rockin' Good on the Macintosh...,"Bought this unit mostly to record LPs or cassettes and enable a non-optical digital out on my G5 to use with a set of 5.1 speakers I have. Plugged it in and recorded from my cassette deck with no problem at all. Very clean.One bonus is that the volume control on the front adjusts the volume on the Macintosh without having to configure a thing. Awesome and a great buy... consider that you'd have to buy a separate external volume control, an input device and a 5.1 processor to get everything that's in this one component. Wow!"
1,Beware of sudden allergic reaction!,"I was reading some of the reactions to Prevage MD and I had exactly the same reaction as another poster. I used it for about a month and suddenly I woke up to a red, burned-feeling face. It itched so badly I cried. Nothing over the counter would stop it. My eyes were swollen shut and then my face began to peel. It was horrible! I ended up going to the doctor and had to have a steroid injection to stop the rapid advancement of my allergic reaction.(Which was progressing even as I sat in the doctor's office.) I do not have overly sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to any lotions or other treatments before, but I made up for lost time when I used Prevage MD. When I told my doctor what had happened she said, ""Oh yes, that happens fairly often."" That might have been good to know before I shelled out $135. Be very careful. I learned a very expensive lesson."
5,ABZOO,I have been using Prevage MD for many years and I love it. My recent purchase was the first time I bought it online. The price was much less than I usually pay and my order arrived very fast. I would definitely recommend ABZOO to my friends. I plan to not only order this product from ABZOO but to explore what other items they sell.
1,Bad reaction to Prevage,"I bought prevage from my dermatologist. I put it on my face and neck before I went to bed. I woke up with my entire face swollen. My eyes, in particular, were so swollen I could barely see. My neck was red, hot and itchy. Benedryl did not help reduce the pain and suffering. It lasted for three days. Horrible!I have used many other anti-wrinkle products in the past, prescription and non-, without a bad reaction.I would not even give it one star!!!"
1,disappointed,I had purchased Prevage elsewhere. The product had worked very well. It had lightened some dark spots noticeably and also removed some fine wrinkles. When I started using the Prevage I got from Amazon the dark spots and wrinkles came back after about 3 weeks of using the product. I am not pleased at all with the results I got from the product. It seems to be totally different than the product I bought in the past (not from Amazon)
5,Great great CD,"Beautiful songs, beautiful arrangements--great great Arranger. My favorite selections is ""Mary in the Morning""--soothing yet exciting--sensuous. Buy the CD!"
2,misleading title,"now, before i start let me just say that ""the littles"" has been a favorite cartoon of mine(and one i haven't seen in ages). when i noticed this dvd for sale i grabbed it quick, but after watching it i was disappointed that there was nothing to do with christmas aside from the cover art. however, you get four great episodes from the show, i just wish the company would not have promoted it as a christmas special."
4,Heavy duty cabinet with no key required,"This is a very heavy metal key cabinet. As with other reviews I agree that the lock is cheaply made and will probably break but I still like the cabinet, I'll just be careful."
2,Broke in 2 months,As other reviewers have noted -- the lock broke in about 2 months. Waste of $45 -- If you're looking for security you're better off spending a bit more for a more substantial product.
5,A fine alternate ending to his finest work,"At the end of The Name of the Game is Death, Dan J Marlowe's finest work, the hard-boiled protagonist Drake who looks like he is going to get away runs into an unexpected police barricade and eventually is captured.When I got that far, it was like finding that the character in the Stark series, also about a hard-boiled protagonist who pulls jobs, had suddenly been run over by a truck that came out of nowhere. I enjoyed Name, but thought he made a mistake effectively killing off Drake the way he did.Well, apparently so did Marlowe, because One Endless Hour pastes tens of pages of dialog from Name right into itself to establish the story line, and then imagines that Drake heals and gets away from the authorities to wreak more havoc, much to the reader's delight.Both books are tensely plotted reflecting many details of daily life in mid-century America. The action is hot and the protagonist knows what he wants and how to get it.Highly recommended."
5,Subconscious Swing,"After seeking a solution to my ball striking woes in tape after tape,I became so MECHANICAL from all the instruction,my swing became a total mess.Enter Al Geiberger's video.No positions to study.No endless verbage.I relaxed in my recliner and simply watched a beautifully flowing swing...OVER and OVER and.... After 4 consecutive viewings and no range work, I played 9 at my usual course and hit 6 of 7 fairways,6 of 9 greens,and shot 41 ! This tape isn't the greatest in terms of visual quality,BUT IT WORKS !I'm buying several to give at Christmas time. Buy it."
2,Average-but nothing to write home about,"I just finished the book, and am convinced that it could have been much better. The largest problem was the ending. The ending doesn't close the book properly, and the reader is left hanging. Also, the book is anti-climactic. The action didn't seem to rise and fall like it should. There was also no sense of completion-we don't know enough about the plot to understand what exactly we've accomplished by the end of the book. The characters were interesting, but nothing seemed to come together. In summary-only pick this up if you've got nothing better to do. For those interested in the WWII spy thrillers, let me recommend The Unlikely Spy by Daniel Silva. It's much better. If the genre doesn't matter, why don't you pick up anything written by Robert Ludlum instead of this? It's bound to be better."
1,Another Griffin Dissapointment,"I got sucked into another disappointing story from W.E.B. Griffin that ended abrubtly without any resolution. Too much detail on past relationships, and too much resaying the entire name, btw what is the SS/SD ? The ending was so disappointing and you never found out about Dr. Diers transfer to US or Joesph P. Kennedy and Commander Bitter destroying the Submarine docks ? What happened ? It just ends with no explanation."
3,Season 5 shows signs of series fatigue. Humor has become annoying.,"For some reason, Monk is more annoying than funny in season 5. What were amusing quirks have now become annoying distractions. Either the humor has become predictable over time, or the timing of the scripts has gone off. The stories seem to take too much effort at trying to be funny, setting up situations for Monk's quirks instead of letting them happen from the normal flow of the story. Re-viewing seasons 1 to 4 points towards the season 5 scripts as the problem. And the mysteries are so far fetched that it is useless to play along with the detective work. The solution will be totally absurd.There are still a few enjoyable episodes, and Monk's new partner fits in well. I would wait for a $19.99 special to get this."
4,Monk 5,Another great season for Monk. More sleuthing like only Monk can do. A suprise visit by Monk's dad makes it an even more interesting season.
3,Limited use by design,This Wall Standoff can only be used as Wall Standoff. I was planning to use it also as a Roof Standoff. But it doesn't work. The mounting angle was not flexible by design. they should design it better so it could be used for roof too. All they need to provide is a mounting piece for a different mounting angle.
5,Little Giant Wing Span/Wall Standoff,"received ladder attachment in good shape. haven't been able to use it yet, as was ordered in the winter. We have an old house with windows placement that makes it awkward to place a ladder against the house to clean the gutters. So don't actually know yet how well the wall standoff will work."
5,Don't even need to hear it all to know it's good.,"i've only heard a couple songs from this CD, but I can tell already that once I get this CD, I won't be able to stop listening to it. You can download two of their songs from mp3.com and find out exactly what i mean."
5,"Fantastic, Fantastic.... FANTASTIC!!","This is one great and fantastic album. Absolutely the best music. I love each and every song. If you like the Beatles, you will love Paul McCartney and Wings."
3,Only 2 Out of 4 Parts of the Show are Really Funny,"Good, but not the best work of John Ritter. Funny parts include John dresses and dances like a Punk Singer, plus he turns into a monkey-look monster at the airport security check.You can buy and keep this DVD for memorizing John's witty and funny TV performance. But don't expect the DVD to be excellent in terms of video quality since it is duplicated from an old TV Show of the 80s. Besides, the DVD runs less than a hour at the cost of almost 20 dollars. I enjoy and love Three's Company DVDs far more and waiting for the Fourth Season and rest of the season versions to come!"
3,Too much irrelevant staff,"Not bad, but too much cheesy humor and a lot of talking. Very ltitle actual game."
3,Dreamweaver Bible is satisfactory,"This book is helpful, but it could be better. Everything you need is covered, but explanations could be clearer. Frankly, except for general information about the web, I found almost everything I needed on the on-line Dreamweaver help pages."
5,ultimate book for dream weaver2.0,I came to know about this book from a computer graphics expert.If you are new to web page design like me this the book for you.It covers from basics to advanced concept of Dream Weaver 2 (The right software to develop a web page). Buy the BIBLE of web page design....
2,"Claims to be a BIBLE, but is missing the GENESIS book","The numerous people who have written reviews in favor of the book are correct when it comes to the information and detail used throughout. My main complaint and concern with the book is that it claims to be for beginners and intermediates, but seems to be slacking in the beginners department. The author assumes that the reader is already familar with how to make a web page, and that's where the problem begins. I do not know how to begin making a web page, and being a student, I have to learn fast for classes. So, when the author began in areas that I am unfamiliar with, I was very confused. I decided to go ahead and keep the book for reference though. I did purchase the book Dreamweaver 2 H.O.T. (Hands On Traning), which I whould highly recommend to people who really have no idea how to start a web page. The BIBLE was not suited for me, but I am sure that I will use it when I become more familiar with the software."
3,Fun and friendly,Bought this for my 7 yr old cousin. Thought this would be something he would enjoy. He did.
2,Frogie went a courting and that is it!,This movie was not my cup of tea! Don't think I haveever seen one as bad as this one! Yuk!
2,very disapointed,"I am single and have used the rotisserie maybe six times in six months, the motor mount has bent away from the wall of the stove so it no longer engages. You can hear the motor running but is now bent to far out of line to use the rotisserie. The idea of a 22 lb turkey is a joke. I have used it only for the smallest chickens i can find at the grocery store. 3-4 lbs tops. For the money I spent I find this unacceptable. I am looking for an official Franklin web site to let them know what I think. So far no luck with an answer. I think they learned about customer service from the cell phone industry. This is less than a year old it should be under warrantee but I can't find a way to contact them that gets me an answer. And do I really want another crappy stove? steve in Cleveland"
2,Beware!!!!,"I have had this Franklin Chef for almost 3 years. I used it daily and sometimes twice a day. Yesterday, all of a sudden, it quit working. The lights came on, the fan worked, the timer worked but no heat. I called the manufacturer (at the 800# that came with the manual) only to be told that they no longer make the oven and there's nothing they can do for me.In doing some surfing for a solution, there's a Franklin Machine Products (don't know if they are the same company or not or even if they sell parts for this particular oven) that sells cooking heating elements, etc. but the cost for the elements (if that's what is wrong) would cost almost a much as a new oven."
3,Not the best but not awful.,"If you are looking for a good beginner video that really goes over the basic positions and steps, then find a different video. If you want something that gives a quick overview with real ballerinas dancing through after each little section this is what you want. Also, if you don't mind the music and words that teach the child what to do (""I open my toes and close my toes, standing very straight...."") My daughter really likes it because of the ""real"" ballerinas and tends to follow them instead of learning the basics, which is fine. But for the cost, I was really looking for something that would give her a good base, such as first through fifth position first, arm positions, then movements, then dance steps or choreography. This seems to be a rather old looking video as well."
4,"great product,just slow to arrive","The product was exactly as described,but came at the very end of estimated time range.But, the product was great"
4,If international travel is an issue...,"I called Kodak to inquire about voltage requirements for this charger. I was told that this charger works only with 110 volts. While this is fine for use in the U.S. and other 110 volt countries, it won't help you in 220 volt countries unless you carry along a converter.The Olympus charger, on the other hand, works in 100-240 volt environments. I called Olympus to confirm this, and the unit I purchased states the voltage requirements on the unit itself. Olympus support also told me that they make only one charger, so any potential buyer need not worry about specific Olympus models.Both chargers are highly rated, but if you plan to use your charger internationally, consider the Olympus product over the Kodak."
3,Completely predictable,"A recent widower defends his sister in law who is accused of murdering her ex-husband's trophy wife after a bitter custody dispute. Dennehy is always believable as the hapless lawyer and Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) portrays the sister in law who doesn't put up much of a defense much to his frustration.I love character actor Dennehy, who always injects an ""everyman"" vibe to all of his characters. Unfortunately, at a little under three hours, there were lots of twists and turn, but this was too long and too predicatable. I guessed the ""twist"" within in the first half hour, so it was a big letdown. The Madriani character lives on, but not with Dennehy - he is protrayed by Mr. Big himself, Chris Noth in a sequel from 2001."
2,Disappointed,"My 3 yo daughter loves this show and the music. Unfortunately none of the music on the cd sounds like the songs on the show. The only song she likes on the cd is the Wag and Wiggle song, so I have to keep replaying it. Definitely wouldn't recommend this one for toddlers."
2,Disappointment,"We looked forward to this blanket, based on the rave reviews. When it arrived, we were unpleasantly surprised. Not only is it difficult and cumbersome to wrap our newborn in, but even after getting her in, the leg portion is loose. The biggest problem to us is really the difficulty of use. Wrapping each arm first, and then the long final portion of the wrap has to go around the baby about 4 times. By the time you get it on her, she is in a terrible mood!Get the first years swaddler, much easier and works great"
2,She outgrew them in no time!,"This is a good blanket, but it only fit my newborn for 2 months. I don't see how any average sized baby can fit in this for longer than that. Currently my baby is 23 inches long and the pocket for her legs force her to bend her knees. I wish I could return this item, but they won't take it back if your child just ""outgrew"" it."
4,was ok,"I like it it is working fine, but it still picks up interference despite the fact it had built in shielding. It does ok for what it is so i gave it 4 stars."
1,Item never came as promised.,I put in an order on this item about 3 weeks ago. I am very disappointed that it never came as promised. I never received any follow up from the company.
2,Very poor production quality,"I tried to watch these videos, but the production quality is terrible. It's hard to hear what Dr. Dyer is saying because of ineffective microphones, poor acoustics, and audience noises, and the video looks like something taken by an amateur. I will be donating these to my local charity, money down the drain!"
4,Lovely . . .,". . . but it is essentially the same disc as his latest US release, My New Old Friend. Both sessions were recorded at the same time and place, December 10, 11, 2003, at Conway Studios, Hollywood, CA. Seven of the ten selections appear on both discs. It doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to purchase this disc at nearly $50 dollars to get three different tunes. Probably for Pasqua completists and/or the filthy rich only."
2,It's rather slow,"It is easy to use, but it's only about twice the speed of the serial interface. I also have a parallel port smartmedia card read, and that runs at 15x serial speed."
2,Not my first choice for starting in C,"I owned this book over 15 years ago when it was calledC Programming in 12 Easy Lessons. It provides a very basic introduction to C - loops, conditionals, printing text to the screen, and getting input from the keyboard. What the book fails to do is present the user with enough technical understanding as to how or why C works the way that it does. C is a very small language but allows the programmer a great amount of power, and none of that is explored. You cannot teach the language in the way you would teach Visual Basic or another less technical language.There are no good explanations, challenges, or concepts explained in the book and you will feel stranded once you get another book on programming in C."
4,The title says it all,"If you're looking for an intro to programming (especially C/C++ or Java), this is a good place to start. The writing is clear, the code is well commented, and the tone is far less patronizing than those ""moron"" books. Not required reading, but suggested."
1,A complete waste of money!,"Looking at the other reviews, I can not help but laugh and think 'Gee, I wonder if the author entered most of those'. Anyways, on with the review! I found this book to be, well, absolute garbage. If you are looking to learn C programming, this is not the book for you. It lacks much detail, and is not clear on definitions. I could go on & on about this book, but I will not. The bottom line is: I would highly recommend not buying this book."
1,Not for beginners,I read it and it took me no where. Still stuck in that cave if you know what I'm saying
4,A pretty good book,"After using C++ for a year I decided it was time to find out how to understand all those C programs found on most UNIX machines. This book was very helpful in finding the suttle differences between C and C++. If you know C++ you can get through the book in about a week. However if you're looking for a techie-type book, stay away from this one. It had some small bits of advanced information but not much. I'm now looking for soemthing that gets you from the basics to the good stuff. I also found that the logic in this book is not well explained and at some points it even looked flawed."
5,mini dolls are fun,My three year old daughter loves mini corolle dolls. They are her favorite kind of Corolle doll. She loves to cuddle them in her little arms. They have cute little faces and the clothes are of nice quality. I have this one and the Asian one in the closet to give her for Christmas this year.
3,corelle mini calin pastel,"It shows two pictures of the doll leading you to believe it has two outfits. You don't know which outfit you are going to get. Bummer for me, because I was replacing the one I had to wash (beads went up into head)-daughter only sleep with that doll and she knows the difference. Was disappointed with the misleading pictures. Would have liked to choose outfit.Corolle Mini Calin Pastel"
5,Psych,"This is absolutely wonderful!!! I don't think I've had any problems with it at all. If you want to buy a season of Psych, you should do it here! Plus, it's cheaper than anywhere else!"
4,Psych: The Complete First Season,I actually like the show. It is kind of different and it grew on me when I watched it on ION when they played it over and over but then they stopped it and I was actually looking forward to it being on. I went ahead and bought the first 2 seasons when they were selling for 12.95 at the time. I then bought 3 & 4 season a couple weeks later & they were 8.95. I now want to purchase 5 & 6 but it is now 20 bucks. I will wait until they come down again before I buy 5 & 6. All in all...I would recommend these to someone who wants something different in the comedic and quick witted line of a show.
4,"Quick read, very helpful","I love this book and go back to it often when I find myself having a lot of conflict with my son. The message is simple enough that it's easy to remember and implement- if you find yourself struggling with your kids, take a look inside yourself and see what could be contributing to it on your end. Fix that, and most of the time the problem melts away. It's not the solution for every problem, but I can definitely say that whenever I find myself really getting into it with my son, if I take I step back I can see I'm tired, hungry, or burnt out.A must read for anyone who's interested in compassionate, gentle parenting.I took off one star for the goofy font. Makes it harder to read. I don't think anyone over the age of 12 should publish things in handwriting-style fonts."
4,Upbeat and entertaining...,"My family listened to this CD driving cross-country this past summer. My 3 yr old still wants to listen to it - over and over!! But, it's still okay because the tunes are done well. The family fav is Buttercup. My daughters (ages 8 and 3) and I lip-synced to it at a Girl Scout campover. We had the whole hall clapping! The songs differ from the original versions but they are still enjoyable. I wasn't familiar with the Sugar Beats when I bought this but I'm buying another."
4,Good taste and easy,I really do like this product. Having one before and then one after my workouts allows me to have something easy and quick and not worry about having heartburn during my exercise session which happens with other food. I also like this particular flavor.
4,Sensory Overload,"This book is packed with great dough ideas. I've only tried a 10th of what this book has to offer, but can't wait to try them all. We used a sand dough for a castle, needed for a school project. I've used it with my preschool, and pre-k children (work), as well as my own tweens."
4,Not bad but tough to get into,"Difficult to get to grips with modelling at first; this book may prove to be a challenge, but if you stick with it, it can be quite rewarding. There are no real ""tutorials"" as such, rather you are given less detailed ""walk-throughs"" where you can just examine what techniques are used. I think any non-lightwave user will find this more of a struggle as, like with most of Bill's works, most of the walk-throughs are Lightwave based. It would have been nice if there were more detailed tutorials however and I would advise would-be readers to not just try and re-create the models in the book, but also try from an early stage to create their own, maybe more basic models."
5,Love the New Colony 6,"I am from South Carolina and though NC6 never got a Big name for themselves here in the south, they certainly got my attention. I remember the first time i heard them on WAPE from Jacksonville, FL. I was hooked and still am! Thanks to Rhino for refreshing my memory!"
4,Great talent with abundant humor,"I first saw this book from Communication Art Illustration Annual Issue. The illustrations were so appealing that I had to get this book. Peter Brown is such a talented artist with great sense of humor. The story was very fresh as well. My daughter pointed out the penguin and other birds. She is a bit young to understand to story but in due time she will enjoy it as much as me. I just can't get enough of the illustrations, I visited his website with all the cool flesh. Definitely a talent to keep an eye on."
3,High Hopes for the New Edition,"This book provides some helpful tips with regard to case briefing - the ""Studying the Law"" Chapter is certainly the most in depth and helpful. If nothing else this book makes one excited to begin their legal education.As another reviewer points out most of us who have gotten into law school already know how that Professors aren't interested in spoon feeding answers and that we should write legibly during exams - which are among the sillier tips Munneke provides.The book is extremely outdated with regard to technology but that should be expected as it was published in 2001. It is in need of updating and I would be interested to see what the 2008 version will add.Gary Munneke also plugs some of his other books in the course of the read which is fairly inappropriate (those sorts of things should be included after the text)."
1,"Sorry, just junk","Very poor quality. Disappointing of Weaver to say the least. Weak spring, lousy button, doesn't fit securely on the scope at all."
2,Depressing and formulaic,"Can't add to the breathless reviews here. Even in 1979 wasn't the tale of the put-upon orphan old? The harridan who cleans too much? The snide, hypocritical ""adoptive"" uncle? ,The characters do not ring true. I can find no reason for the brother to abandon the other, and (as in so many orphan books) can see no reason they turn out to be nice people when raised by cliches of nastiness.If you like Tale of Despereaux, another tale wherein mindless, contrived suffering is romanticized, you'll love this."
4,"Nice Pictures, Not Enough Information, Worth Your Time","This book would more appropriately be titled as a photo history.The pictures are great! The author's text and captions almost assume you already know the history of the series and are often repetitive. The word ""dominated"" is used three times in the second paragraph of the book and after about the forth time one does get tired of being reminded that there was no drivers championship before 1972.That said, this would be a three star book. What takes it up a notch are the quotes from the drivers and other series participants that are included on most pages. I attended Trans Am races in 1970 & 1971 and was an avid fan of the series. The quotes add a nice perspective and bring new material to light."
4,Great to lose weight,"This is a really great set of videos. I have lost a lot of weight and still losing. I alternate between the 2 mile and 3 mile walk every other day. When I first started I had a significant amount of weight on me and I was able to do the videos. I recommended it highly for people who can not bounce around but want to lose weight. You get a really good fat burning workout!The music is corny & there are some mistakes in the video, but other than that you will lose weight with these videos and they are not difficult."
5,Awsome,These tapes are great! I did the 1 mile walk throughout my entire pregnancy and stayed in excellent shape! Now I do the 2 and 3 mile tapes and have more muscle tone than I had when I was using more intense tapes like Taebo and Denise Austin.Anyone can do these tapes. My 80 year old grandmother is doing the 1 mile. I can't recommend these tapes enough. Thanks Leslie!
5,The only fitness video I've stuck to!,"I hate to exercise but Leslie makes it fun and easy. It's a good work out, but simple so it's easy to stick with it. I have only done the one mile so far but I plan to work my way up. I would highly recommend this DVD."
1,It SUCKS!!!!!,This movie sucked hard! One of the worst movie in the whole freakin world! I wrather give up a billon dollars then see this movie again.
4,Arrived earlier than expected.,"Arrived earlier than expected. It looks good. Thought it would be a bit bigger, but otherwise, it's what I was looking for."
4,"It's really nice, but be careful handling it.","I really like this pashmina. It's light-weight, yet keeps you warm. But you have be careful how you handle it. One of the fringes snagged on something and it caused the thread to run. So now one end of my pashmina doesn't have that seamless look. I was bummed out."
4,Great if you like stories and recipes,"I like reading the stories a lot, and there are plenty of recipes. A great book if you are looking for history and culture with your cookbook recipes."
1,Horrible,"I only like two songs on this album, ""Bad Attitude,"" and ""Show Me."" Peter's drumming on this album isn't good. The songs aren't written well, and have horrible lyrics."
2,"Learn a lot, but only after you suffer a lot","In chapter 5 the author writes: What are User-Defined Properties? First of all, you need to understand the difference between predefined and user-defined properties. User-defined properties are those properties that already exist in the UserControl Object ... Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that a definition of predefined properties. Of course. The author got them mixed up, didn't he. How much further will you have to read before you realize his mistake. This is only one of hundreds such inaccuracies in the book. Still, if you can correct the author's sloppiness, you will learn a lot about ActiveX Control design."
3,"Good, not great","Lot's of recipes in this one. I was expecting more information. What information is in this book is good; it's like talking about brewing with your buddies. If only I knew these people personally! This is a good book to help you focus on what's important, and understand where you can be creative. Don't get me wrong, I like it; I'm just not going gush."
1,The Old Style is MUCH Better,I hate this new form! There is absolutely no room to explain labor charges. Bring back the old style! I'm looking everywhere for them.
1,Too lazy to update the book?,"The idea of that book is excellent: to list wines that are medal winners, and, even better, multiple medal winners! Plus some additional generally useful information about wines for novices. But, and here is ""but"", the authors did not update their past books (I have used some older editions when they were freshly published and they were excellent and very useful!) and this book is simply useless. The winners are from 2000, 2001 or 2002 and very few of newer ones, and by now they are all gone from normal wine stores! So, what is needed now, is a good update and a new publication, and I am sure it will be a bestseller!"
2,Not CCIE stuff,"An O.K book for starters and who want to get to know a bit about N/W design. But, it's too non-technical to be of any use to designers. Definitely, not CCIE level. Not worth buying if you can get same info from cisco web-site"
3,Cisco ...so it must be good ! Right ?,This book is online. Don't waste your money. If you don't have a CCO account I would suggest getting it. This has good configuration examples.
3,HTC HD2 case,"I bought this product for my HTC HD2 phone, to protect it from scratches and falls. It's a sturdy product and also a nice design. The only thing I didn't like about it, was whenever I charged my phone on the cradle dock, I have to remove this cover. If you don't have a dock charger, then you shouldn't have any problem."
2,"Far too broad, jarring text","This is by far the least satisfying title in the IVP series on Christianity. Evans covers far too much ground, assumes the reader knows too much, and has some of the most jarring incomplete prose I have come across. I would NOT recommend this title."
5,get this if you like to THINK,"...As it says in the header, you should only try something like this out if you can stand to THINK. Trwstrynd Aylsquythe-Poynsenby is an iconoclast, he is an historian and a man of great learning. he does not however pander to watered-down opiates for a crutch-needing society.this material will, more likely than not, dispell a lot of illusions you entertain about the world and civilization in general. if you can handle what mr. Aylsquythe-Poynsenby has to say, i would really recommend it. if not, well, have a good day."
1,Even Bad In 1982!,"I thought it had that odor of being praised by educators and clergy alike! I'm getting out'a this here prison soon and that book along with ""Locksmithing For BIG Profits"" and ""Quit That Job NOW! - There's More Money In ACCORDION REPAIR"" will have me set for life for a highly paid career that can't go out of style!Actually is would be good to find whoever it is that's still profiting off this boosted up, crass, scammer's cheesy ""Let's Start Making MONEY"" legacy and ice them."
1,Warning: This is not a replacement fror the Lens Cap for the SX10,"Although the dates of these reviews have changed since I ordered this lens cap, when I did order it, the implication was that it was a replacement for the lens cap that came with the Canon SX10 and SX20 IS. It isn't. It was my stupid mistake because I was looking at ""Other things that SX10 buyers buy,"" this lens cap was one of them. But it's for the extension lens.It's not fair to give it one star, but when it was first offered, it was completely misleading. Since so many had complained about the fact that there's no tether from the lens cap to the camera, I assumed that it was a replacement lens cap. It isn't, and I guess that's enough said.I'm still looking for a replacement, btw. It's obvious to me that I'm going to lose the original. I've already misplaced it in shirt and pants pockets, and I've dropped it a number of times, narrowly missing a grate over the river in the park."
3,"Good item,","The len cap itself is in good condition; however, the packaging is simple and cheap, in a small stabled plastic bag, which made me wonder how Canon could sell its product like this.."
3,Shipping Rip Off,Lens caps are fine but when I used one-click shipping I was charged almost $20 dollars to ship 3 lens caps from NJ to VA!!! The caps were only $19. I'll NEVER use one-click again. Caveat emptor check your S&H costs before ordering.
4,Not a match,So others don't make the same mistake I did: This does not fit the EF 50mm f/1.8 II Canon lens.
1,Lens cap does not fit my lens,Even though the cap says it is for a 58mm lens it doesn't fit my lens and falls off with the slightest touch. Very disappointed.
3,Confused over vendor,"I ordered another product at the same time from this vendor, which ended up being canceld since they never confirmed the order with Amazon. But I got this product w/no problems at all. Hmmmmmmm... won't be using this vendor... they are not consistant."
3,not for me,"I got this dictionary knowing the korean words were ordered by their romanized sounds as opposed to the korean alphabet. I thought this would suit me better since my ability to alphabetize english is faster than my ability to alphabetize korean. after a few weeks of trying to use this as my quick translation dictionary I found it to be more of a hassle than anything. korean is not an easily romanized language, there can be differences between how a word sounds in my head and how it's written in english, maybe some people are better at this than me but I found myself flipping to the wrong end of the book for a word. im sure with a little practice it can be a very usable dictionary but for me ill stick with my hangul.some good things about this dictionary, its nice and small about 6""x4""x1"" and the romanization can be nice for helping with pronunciation."
3,A good dictionary with some shortcomings,"I have been looking forward to the publication of this volume for quite a while for I was hoping for a Korean reference more compact than the Minjung's English-Korean/Korean-English dictionary which have used until it was dog-eared. Nevertheless, for those accustomed to dictionaries organized according to hangul alphabetization, Langenscheidt's phonetic organization (according to the Roman alphabet) as well as its strict adherence to McCune-Reishcauer romanization for Korean may at first be disconcerting as it was for me. There are also no hanja for those of us who use Chinese roots for understanding new words and building vocabulary. Though aesthetically pleasing and good for beginners, it may not be nearly as satisfying for better Korea hands than me."
3,The Second Edition is Second Best,"The first edition of this book was co-written by only David Rhoads (a professor of religion) and Donald Michie (a professor of English). They make a winning combination, showing very effectively that the Gospel of Mark is a wonderfully composed short story, using very thoughtful literary means to convey the theological message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I highly recommend the book for any who wish to discover a new and fruitful way to study Mark. The lessons learned about the Bible as a piece of literature are invaluable.This second addition differs from the first by having a third author, Johanna Dewey (a New Testament scholar), whose effect on the book is to transform it into a book for New Testament scholars. This loss is substantial while the gain is minimal."
2,green ape gloves,I would not recomend to anyone some more junk made in china the last pairs I bought a few years ago I believe were made in usa I loved them much better fit . no problem with the merchant just that the mfg is selling a poorer product
5,Excellent,"I read this book cover-to-cover and passed with 95%. It does a great job of covering the details of networking and TCP/IP. It has more information than what you'll need for Network+, but that just means it does a great job covering everything. I've only got two more exams to go before MCSE 2000, and I'm certain the networking foundation has helped out a lot."
5,Clear and Concise,"I found this book extremely helpful. It is a well-organized, clear and concise textbook that is, in my opinion, an excellent educational tool."
4,Very happy with this product,I have been taking this brand of Pycnogenol for the past few weeks and am happy with it. I like the small tablet size. I take it to ease joint aches and pain and it works for me.
3,Esta bueno pero muy caro,"Considero que 45 billetes es mucho para un CD que tiene mas de 10 años, creo que deberian ponerlo por lo menos a $10"
3,Horatio Says...,"Horatio says this mat is a good mat but a big mat. The DeLa(censored)mann family is not known for their tape-measurability or attention to detail, and Horatio is no exception. The product description include accurate measurements but Horatio not understand the size of measurements. Sadly ,this sturdy mat no fit in Horatio's doorway, so Horatio must return. Horatio gives 3 stars not for this, but due to the logo is also much large for mat so Horatio's guests would have bigger impression of Horatio's Flyerdom but less fiber to wipe their feet upon."
5,STRAIGHT TO THE POINT,"It only took me a few days to read this book, because when I started reading it, I could not put it down. It is really a wonderfully written book. It makes you stop and think about organ donation. I suggest anyone to read this, I feel you will thoroughly enjoy it from beginning to end. By the time you are finished reading you will feel as though you know the people personally. You can tell the writer really means what he is writing. A MUST READ!"
5,wish I could HEAR it,"While McCaffrey is my favorite author and I have read almost ALL of her books, I was totally looking forward to having this book on my Kindle 2 so I could HEAR it again. My husband and I like to listen to books while we travel.Having already read this book and truly enjoyed the read, we were looking forward to being able to enjoy it while we travel. So, I was very disappointed to find that the ""text to speech"" was not available for this book.I know that 'text to speech"" is supposed to be experimental, but every other book I've tried on Kindle I was able to hear except this one. If I had known ahead of purchase that I wouldn't be able to use the ""text to speech"" function, I would not have purchased this book.It would be helpful if Amazon noted this on the blurb so folk wouldn't buy a book hoping to hear it and not be able to. I had no need to purchase this book for any other reason since I already own the hard copy."
4,The Lure of Crystal...,"My first encounter with Anne McCaffrey may very well be the best. ""Crystal Singer"" is an engrossing book, with a very headstrong and admirable female character. By the time her new direction in life is setup and put into motion, I was totally entranced with the book and simply could not put it down. The characters, both male and female, are well fleshed out, and her rise from a rejected opera student to a full fledged crystal singer is a fascinating journey to embark on. The premise for the book - singing and cutting crystal - is unusual and well presented. There is a definite otherworldly flavor to the book as it has a strong sci fi theme that does not assault the reader with too much techno babble, thus its an enjoyable book for the diehards and the casual alike. As the first of a trilogy, its delightful, but also stands alone well with its satisfying conclusion. Highly recommended, but with a word of warning, its nearly impossible to break away from the lure of crystal."
4,liked it,"I really enjoyed this book and the rest of this short anne maccaffrey series. I am a big fan of her dragon books but this was a very interesting read, with a real girl heroine/character. I enjoyed the story through all three books Anyone who likes a nice sci-fi read that isn't too deep but entertaining would enjoy these books. I did, and I have re-read them a couple of times now."
2,Extortion,"I bought the Monster component cable to replace the stock cable that came with the 360. The stock cable has a toslink out on the cable. The Monster brand has a proprietary connection instead of a toslink(1/8th mini jack). So if you want digital audio(and you do if you sprung for the Monster component cable), you are REQUIRED you to buy their optical cable in order to get the mini jack to toslink convertor.Needless to say, that is low, and yet typical of the overrated/overpriced Monster brand. Since these are the only high end A/V cables for the 360, and do make a difference, it's worth it, but beware of this."
1,Who edits this stuff?,"I've read all of the RDI books, and this has to be the worst. I'll agree with the other reviewers who complained about the predictability, the homophobia, and the weak writing. And I'll up the ante with weak editing. Other RDI books have typos and spelling errors in them, but this one looks like no one even ran it through spell-check before they published it.But the best part:""...we followed her swaying, tiered gathers of orange with pink bric-a-brac...""Lovely as the image of a hostess at a Mexican restaurant with knick-knacks swaying from her skirt is, this is a book whose narrator is a seamstress. You'd think she'd know the difference between rick-rack (the zigzag trim I'm assuming she was talking about) and bric-a-brac (snow globes and collectible spoons from Disneyland)."
3,Why give away the end of a book with the title?,"Am I the only reader who was utterly shocked that there was no mystery about the end of the book!!?! I can't understand for the life of me, why an author would want to give away the ending to her own book, before you even open the first page. But, besides that aspect, I purchased this after loving all the other Red Dress Inc. publications. This contemporary novel is no Milk Run, my favorite of the Red Dress books. Definitely not a must read. Like I said, if you want to know what happens, just read the title."
1,Fabio should have been on the cover,"Let me say that the only thing worthwhile about this book, and I mean the only thing, is that it has a cool cover. Lisa Cach, the author, is the sort of cheesy romance novelist who has guys like Fabio on the cover of her books. I don't know anyone my age (26) who would refer to her occupation as ""mistress of the seam."" People don't talk like that. Lisa, stick to Fabio.Milkrun by Sarah Mlynowski is a much better read."
4,One of R&B's best voices from the heyday of rock 'n roll,"Ben E. King had legions of admirers during his years in the spotlight, even if the Drifters' tyrannical owner George Treadwell wasn't one of them. King left the group after a salary dispute with the owner who conveniently forgot what a good thing he had, ignoring the string of hits the Drifters had with King doing the lead chores. King went on to a distinguished career as a solo act with big hits such as ""Spanish Harlem"", ""Don't Play That Song"", and ""Amor"", all of which are included here. As good as this anthology is, however, the second CD is basically filler. The songs are okay but frankly, not very memorable. The first CD has all the big hits as well as several B sides that were top tunes in their own right, like ""First Taste of Love"", ""On the Horizon"", ""Walking in the Footsteps of a Fool"" and ""Gypsy"". A fine tribute to a great soul singer of the past."
3,Joseph Suarez's Godzilla Review,"This is a bad godzilla toy! It's a Hensi seris Godzilla,and its a great edtoin to any Godzilla calltoin!"
1,Old old old.,I was going to give this as a stocking stuffer. Good thing I looked it over! The felt teeth were water stained and the eyes were sewn in poorly. Didn't look anything like the picture. The forehead was all smooshed in. Sent it back the next day. Very disappointed.
3,Charge & Go Thomas,"Thomas moves about fine on his own, will do ok with lighter cars behind him, but heavier/larger cars bog him down. Make sure the track is laid out level on a hard surface, carpet seems to cause Thomas to get stuck on the junctions between the tracks. He also will not go up inclinded track for the overpasses we have. Easy enough for a 2 year old to figure out and he loved it, he just found it easier to have me do it for him. Overall, not bad."
5,"Inspiring, did she eventually die of cancer?",I'm captured by Jill Ireland's honesty and selflessness. I'd like to read her sequel.
2,Some good insights to improve quality of life,"I felt there were some valuable insights to improve quality of life and attitude for someone suffering from a life threatening or potentially life threatening disease. However her financial situation and style of living, including household help and other resources, separated her from the average person in same situation Chemo treatment appears to have improved considerally since this book was written. Did she eventually die from the cancer?"
4,Alot smaller than anticipated,"Was taken back at the size of this Elmo. Did not expect it to be soo small. However, seems to have high quality construction, as far as I can tell."
4,its gone,you know the group war so i do not have to hip you to them. this c-d is hard to find and that is what makes you look for it..i like the c-d. but it only has a couple of songs that i like. but its the group war so you will not get upset with them.
3,The Last True War Album,"This really was the last true War album...the last one by the seven guys who made the group world famous, anyway...the last before those ""Music Band"" albums. If there's a weakness in the album is that there are only five songs. The strongest cuts are the title song, which features possibly the funkiest bass line B.B. Dickerson ever laid, and the closing tune ""The Seven Ten Soldiers"", a song that I think of as a fitting swan song. Strangely enough the song isn't as downbeat and angry as some of their greatest instrumentals. It's a very beautiful song. The other three songs, well, they're the reason I only give this album three stars. In any case, though, this is a must-have album for all SERIOUS War fans."
2,the great transparent Galaxy in the sky,"War's blatant flirtation with the disco movement of the 70's was never more evident than this 1977 release. This without question was War's statement to the establishment (MCA records) that; ""hey! we can do that dance thing too!"". Indeed they did, right down to their double knit polyester leisure suits.If Galaxy proved anything it was that War and Jerry Goldstein could produce something even more slick and transparent than ""Why Can't We Be Friends?"". Jerry and the crew being careful not to mess with a winning formula, forgot what War were really all about. And it sure as hell wasn't disco balls and butterfly collars.War seem to be going through the motions on Galaxy. When they sing ""it's out of sight, it's out of sight, it's gone"" it's almost as though they're trying to convince themselves of it. Rest assured real fans blew this ""out of sight"" and off the turntable and put ""Deliver The Word"" (no pun intended) back on.olofpalme63"
5,great book!,loaded with great ideas and inspiring photos.A great book to help get you in the Christmas spirit!Beautiful photos and clear instructions.
4,Great for those planning on a cell phone gift for the holida,Great book. Cuts through the double-talk you get these days from the big wireless providers and shows you the real deals.
2,too big!,These are great for making necklaces longer but they are thick and really doesn't look right with finer chains that I have.
4,Good Value,"Like the different size extenders. Quality is good for the price. I don't think they would hold up to everyday wear--they would discolor. However, they are perfect for the necklaces you occasionally wear."
5,good product,These work very well for making shorter necklaces longer. I pair them with magnetic lobster clasps to make necklaces easy on and off also.
5,"One of the ""Greats""",Best historical military related book I have read. Very well written and honest comments by the author and easy to understand. Great reading as well as a good history lesson on the U.S. army after WW2 by one of America's greatest warriors!
2,"One half the music, one channel extremely quiet","I had the cassette years ago and the stereo and sound separation was excellent for that format. This CD production was copied wrong resulting in one channel being so soft you can hardly hear the second Guitarist playing some solos and back-ups. If you like music the way it is suppose to sound and get frustrated hearing a great song missing half the instruments, don't torture yourself and buy this CD. I played the cut ""Crimson and Clover"" once, heard all the errors in the mixing and flipped the CD out the window, it was more enjoyable watching cars run over it than hearing the poor quality it had. Spare yourself and find a better version than this piece of slip-shod product. lol"
1,You people are stupid!!!,Why do you people even bother? I mean you bought this and expected what? This would be some great record. All you silly people that buy these tribute albums on this website or any other all need to be have your head put on a stick.
5,Work Great!,I am a dealer mechanic and these work great. Very low cost for a quality product. They couldn't work better.
3,I liked it very well!,"I like the size of the barrel , iron part, but don't care for the handle. too big hard to control. The seller is awesome . Delivered very fast. Would definitly buy from them again."
4,Step by Step Yoga for Pregnancy,"Terrific book. Very easy to follow and logically organized by trimester. Sound advice and good for everyone from the beginner to the very experienced. Gets a bit into the ""religion"" of yoga, however is still a great resource for the every day pregnant woman looking for a good ~ safe workout. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Odd Assortment of 70s Songs,"Putting Wayne Newton next to Ten Years After is a risky move. Unlike some of the other volumes of the series ""Have a Nice Day,"" this CD is a curious hodgepodge of styles and sounds. Lots of the tracks probably don't ring a bell for most music lovers (""Toast & Marmalade for Tea"" and ""Small Beginnings""?). Diehard collectors will want this CD for its eclectic selections. All original versions."
4,Generation to Generation,This book has great information for leadership for any situation and leader. It is pretty deep reading but very much worth digging into the concepts that are presented by this author. I highly recommend it. You'll have to be patient in reading it but it's worth it.
5,Smarty Kat bobble bops,"My cat loves these!!! He ""fetches"" - we throw and he runs after them and brings them back and drops them at our feet. However, he will not fetch anything else - no balls, mice, nothing except bobble bops!!! I need more and hope to find them. There is just something about them that he loves."
4,This Kick-Ass Princess RULES!,"Love a story where a bad, bad girl with attitude gets her act together to take control (of the hero AND the story outcome)? Martha does exactly that with her intriguing hero, Joaquin, and tells her Hollywood detective/adventure story with in-your-face style and the sting of leather lacings in her voice. A fine, fun story!"
2,"Good book, wrong revision for me","This book is a very good C++ primer, but my class required the 3rd edition, and I accidentally bought this one, the 1st ed. The pages are off by 2 or 3 between each version, and questions at the end of each chapter are very slightly different."
4,"Damn interesting, heavy on the human drama","I read this book after buying on a discout shelf in some clearance book seller. It was a pleasant surprise. It, as I wrote in the title, a little heavy on human drama and soap operatic themes. The science behind it is absolutely interesting and has spurred me to read further on the topic of nanobacteria. This is a great starting out book, but not a great book for those reading for the science of it."
2,Hole in dress,"I am very upset with the quality of this product. It's a cute Fiona dress, but I ordered it as a Christmas gift and when I open it to see the dress I notice that there is a hole in the dress right by the seam dead center of the dress at the top. You can't fix it with a stich without it being noticed. Very disappointed in the quality."
1,Crap absolute CRAP!,"Not the right size, covered in nasty gold glitter that comes off on everything! Scatchy sleeves, just terrible material in all. Wish I had never ordered this product!!!"
3,State of the art Technicolor the real star here.,"Slow moving tale of mad doctor on the loose in the Vienna Opera is not as sinister as one would hope. Karloff is okay and Sondergaard good as the watchful housekeeper, but it is the state of the art Technicolor - here perfectly and impeccably restored - that is the real star. Watch for this reason alone. Sumptuous color design. Oscar nom for Art Direction but it deserved nods for Costumes and Score as well."
4,Excellent quick informative read.,"This book does an excellent job of explaining a complex subject in a very small amount of space. It gives a detailed timeline of the ""Problem in the Middle East."" Its question and answer format makes it easy to read and easy to find information. However there is a noticable slant toward the Israeli side of the conflict."
3,The greatest book ever for the ultra-serious Scrabble player: The rest of us? Not so much.,"I enjoyed this book on the whole, but can recommend it only to those with a serious interest in Scrabble. A lot of the book gets bogged down in the intricacies of competitive Scrabble tournaments, which is interesting only for a short time. I play living room Scrabble, but did not understand how complex and complete the knowledge required to become a true skilled player is.The parts of the book describing the game's genesis and history were interesting. But the 366 pages could have been cut by a third to make for a better book for the masses, in my opinion. Three stars out of five. But a nice effort nonetheless."
4,Delightful book about charming idiosyncratics,"Breezy, fun book about charming (and sometimes alarming) misfits, dysfunctionals, and idiosyncratics. I agree with others who have noted that Fatsis devotes a tad too much narrative to the minutiae of SCRABBLE play, but this doesn't diminish the book's overall likeability. Fatsis also does an amazing job of portraying the ""human side"" of the Deep Geeks (as he once refers to them) and the other obsessed goofballs in the SCRABBLE subculture with love, understanding, respect, and sympathy. God knows that they may be weirder (by several orders of magnitude) than you (or, I hope, me), but they are definitely genuinely insteresting people, and I'm glad Katsis wrote this book about them and his adventures in the SCRABBLE realm."
1,Boring book about boring people!!,"This book is about all the social and career underachievers who play Scrabble as an escape, so they do not have to deal with life. The author describes their medical and psychological ""issues"", ad nauseam! if you don't beleive that such one dimensional people exist with no obvious means of financial support,,,,,,, then read on, but I did not empathize or care about them by the second chapter. Besides, they all stared to resemble each other, I did not care to keep them staight in my mind. You might learn a few new Scrabble words, if you are a hobby player. But I did not find it worth the effort."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I picked up Soul Reaver thinking that I was going to have something as good - if not better than - Blood Omen, the game coming before it. To say ""I was let down"" would probably make understatement of the year. The dismal world of Soul Reaver is more like an empty exploration game than an RPG or action game. The monsters are mundane, the hero is dull and one-sided and the ending (or lack thereof) is the worst pile of snot I've ever had the displeasure of getting from hard hours invested in a video game. Soul Reaver has it's few and far moments, but does not live up to the Legacy of Kain title."
4,Soul Reaver,"The game was really good, as I expected. It seemed to be really short and the world was small though. It felt like it was just the first disc to the game, so I'm pretty excited about playing Soul Reaver 2 soon."
5,No questions asked a superb game,"This game shouldn't even be possible on the PlayStation. The graphics are beautiful and there are no, i repeat NO loading times during the game play. It hasn't been revealed how this was done but the evidence is there. The environments in this game are huge. For those not familiar with the Legacy of Kain series this is the sequel to Blood Omen:Legacy of Kain, but worry not you don't have to have played that one to enjoy this one. Eidos and Crystal Dynamics have produced a game that is fun and challenging. However at points it is too challenging, so have a strategy guide that you can refer to. The FMVs(Full Motion Videos) are of movie quality and look like they should be on the Dreamcast or PS2. Everyone should at least give this game a try. If you don't have a PlayStation this game is also available for the Sega Dreamcast"
4,"Pinacle of adventure game-play, until the end...","Soul Reaver was exiting, with lots of impaling that will makeyou and your friends cheer. It also made you think quite hard tosolve the games many puzzles. However, the total lack of resolution at the end of the game leaves you frustrated and wanting your money back. END"
4,"Tasty, Gives a nice boost but there is a crash",These are quite tasty. About six of them = a Red bull as far as energy boost. The do wear off though after about an hour and there is a noticeable crash. I would get them again.
5,Excellent piece of empty space,"For a circle with a hole in it, this is well worth the money. Of course, you pay for the sturdiness of the piece, since poor build quality could definitely reduce the quality of your pictures. Don't be mislead by the description on Amazon, however. The site implies that this adds 25mm to your lens and that is it, whereas this will ""macro-fy"" your lenses. With this tube, my 28mm focuses from about 1-1.1"" from the front of the lense, with a depth of field of a fraction of a mm at f/1.8. It's also strong enough to support my 200mm f/2.8L + 1.4x II, which is almost more than I can say for myself. My favorite use is in between my 85mm f/1.8 and 1.4x. I got stuck with a mark I, but I don't plan to use EF-S lenses anyway."
5,Extension tube,"I am a beginner with photography. This device doesn't get me to where i want but as it is it works fine. I'm learning what I need to do differently for close up photography. This device came on time and works as stated,"
2,Not worth the price.,"Maybe others have different experience with this one. I have a Rebel T2i, it's a tight fit. Works ok, but I don't think it's worth the price. I don't recommend it! \m/"
5,Absolutely astonishing...,"[...]This is an absolutely fine collection of morality-based tales, belonging on the bookshelf of anyone not in the final stages of relativistic and moral decay. The stories are uplifting and instructive, often at the same time.[...] Mr. Bennett [...] believes that every individual is deserving of an education, and a chance to put to use their God-given talents in a way that is productive to both them, and to society[...]"
5,The Book of Virtues--Well Named,"The Book of Virtues by Wm J Bennentt is a collection of fiction and non-fiction stories, each with a moral attached. Before you run back to the crime flicks and sexy, steamy fare on TV, take another look. You know how good it feels to take a cool shower on a hot day? Well .....Virtues by Bennett is a mini-bath for the soul. I like the fact that these tales are not just for children; after all, we big kids need reminders to love our neighbors,do good. do the RIGHT thing, etc. And don't let the author's rather conservative views scare you off! These stories just hold timeless truths you've known since you were little. You've just forgotten.Diane A Schute New to New Jersey"
2,Terry Oldfield Turning Point,"One great piece... Guardian Angel, the rest of the music is nothing like this one. All together different style. I didn't care for it."
2,A little too scary - there are better ones in the series,"I have the Rockabye Baby CDs for NIN and Tool, so I thought Nirvana would be just as much fun. However, these songs were scary. I'll be playing this as my Halloween music. Honestly, most of this sounds warped and evil. It's probably because Nirvana did not write very complex arrangements - most were basic and fast, and it sounds like murderous clown music when slowed down and music-boxed.I won't be playing this for my little one, but it is very effective mood music if you want to terrify someone."
5,Great for parents and babies!!!,A pretty inclusive compilation of Nirvana's best songs set to glockenspiels and other soothing instruments. This is a great album to have around when you feel like listening to something 'hardcore' but also want to get your kid down for a nap.
3,not exactly what I was looking for,I was looking for the edited version of the song which was released in 1969 and this is the unedited album version which I already have two copies of.
2,Mathematics Thinking,"The book came behind schedule, and was unable to use it for my class as early as possible,and at last, the book did not meet the specification i needed it is an old edition, but the seller displayed the picture of the recent edition as against what he/she sold to me, I really felt bad when i saw it."
2,Food stains on pages.,"I bought it knowing it was used, so I know there would be some wear and tear. However, I did not expect to find stains on pages. This was disgusting in class."
4,Always enjoyed these books,"I may have to go back and read the first book again, it's made me want to revisit the whole story."
2,"Be Warned, Indeed!!","I wish I would have read P.A. Bennett's review before I bought this DVD. I have several DVD's from China and none of them are as obnoxious as this one. The Chinese subtitles are obviously for the vision impaired, ""they're larger than usual and higher up on the picture"". And yes, there is no way to get rid of them. I'll be more careful next time."
1,I was unable to make it work.,"I purchased the reader with the C2020 Olympus Camera to use with my Win2000 operating system. The instructions for installation were incorrect for Win2000, but I was able to download the drivers from their site. Even though the system eventually recognized the USB device, I was unable to read the pictures from the memory card containing pictures recorded by the OlympusC2020 camera. After spending about 3 hours trying everything (I am a software developer fairly experienced in Windows environment), including support (which was prompt), I gave up on this."
2,I DO YOGA REGULARLY AND THIS IS NOT THE BEST CHOICE,"I have purchased many yoga videos hoping for the pefect one and can say the best I have used are the Yoga Zone series- especially Strong and Healthy Back and Stretching for Flexibility. I have been using the poses and stretches that I've memorized from those videos for 2 years now and can say the list of health improvements are endless: frequent migraines GONE, weird aches and pains GONE, frequent indigestion GONE. Past knee injury pain GONE. Back pain and neck tension GONE. Sounds crazy but something about yoga just does wonders for the body! This video was a bit bizarre and went from too easy to too hard within a couple of minutes. It just did not compare to the ease, clear instructions, effectiveness, and relaxation of the Yoga Zone series at all."
5,A Great Set,"It was a pleasure to return to these recordings after so many years of listening to Collard, Roge and the good but over-rated Hough. Ciccolini's tempos are relatively slow; he revels in the beautiful melodies rather than trying to dazzle with virtuoso playing. The recordings are good. Altogether, the best set available."
1,Bad Product,I bought it this product form home depot and after one complete day of sanding I follow all the instruction that is written on the can and at the end I get a ruin table and I even did not get the same color when it dry very bad produce I west my time using it and I need to re-sand the table again .. I don't recommend this product
5,A MOVIE ALL WIVES SHOULD SEE!,"I really liked this movie.It is a wake up call not just for African-American women,but for all married women that suspect their husbands may be cheating.Most of the main chracters do a great job of acting,some of the supporting cast can use some lessons,though.Some scenes are over acted.Vivica Fox is great as usual.And you will be mildly shocked at the surprise ending."
5,Get this DVD TODAY,"I had heard nothing about this movie and only picked it up because the Great Debaters was out and the jacket read good. I'm sOOOO glad I decided to go ahead and get it. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Im usually pretty good a predicting or figuring out who ""do it"" but this one threw me WAYYYY in the left field. When she walked in the room I totally expected to see Monica boy was I wrong. I rented it tonight but I will be purchasing it for my collection of black cinema."
3,Better than I anticipated,"A few years ago, when the original teaser clip named INVISIBLE was posted on the internet, I assumed that it was going to be yet another poke at gay men (pun intended) to scare Black Women to believe that their men were secretly bisexual and sprending HIV to their female partners. Even though I wish that the overall topic/theme had more balance, I have to admit that the final version of COVER was better than I anticipated. Since the film was written by a straight man FOR straight women, I didn't expect them to be sensitive to issues within the bisexual community. I do think that the DVD should have included a few bonus clips with HIV/AIDS Prevention Education information as well as some standard verbage around HIV testing. It is one thing to entertain audiences, but another to educate them along the way. Lastly, linking murder, and HIV infection to cheating, regardless of what sex the other person, is something that I hope future film makers think about in a different way."
4,I'm glad I found this movie,"I saw a little advertising in the paper about this movie. I saw Bill Duke directed it, and so I was willing to give it a chance. It was well worth the trip to the theater. I had no idea about the subject matter, and it's very provocative. It's very in your face once it all unravels, but I think it's well worth seeing and buying the DVD and passing it around to your female friends."
2,"Good message, but overated",Overall I thought the movie had a good message but it could have been presented better. It seems as if everything was squeezed together.
5,Must see,"I had the opportunity to attend a private screening for ""Cover"", along with a question and answer session at the end of the veiwing with director/producer Bill Duke, and actors Raz Adoti and Clayton Prince. It was an awesome experience meeting them, having one on one conversation with them and taking pictures with them. The movie was very well scripted and of course excellently directed. The suspense had a build-up that caused my heart to pound and my mind constantly working trying to figure out who did it and what was going to happen next. I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it again a week later with friends and planned to go back again with another group of friends but was disappointed to find that it was no longer in the theaters. Needless to say, I am ordering my copy of the DVD now and recommend that everyone who has not seen it to get a copy. This is a must-see."
2,I did not like this movie,The story line and actors sucked in this movie. I fast forwarded to the end.
3,Harmony 890,"After a rough start, the remote works fine. I purchased the item with the expectation of being able to run the accompanying software and getting the remote to work in short time. Three hours later (the majority of which was spent on the phone with a Logitech rep who knew less about the remote than I did -- and who could barely speak English) I still could not get the remote to function properly. The next day I spoke with another Logitech rep who admitted that their software was not condusive to my system set-up (not complicated at all -- just a TV, satellite receiver and a DVD/VHS recorder). This rep, however, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Within an hour (and programming done on his side) the remote was working fine! Overall, a good product but some issues with set-up."
4,"Buggy, but very good when it gets going","I ordered this from Amazon and the first unit I got and tried to connect was defective (several buttons did not work at all). The customer service was helpful, if time consuming, and after about a week of trying this and that sent me a brand new unit. Then after some tweaking and massaging with customer service again, it is finally up and running. Now it works great. There is a pretty tech intensive process to get it programed the way you want it, but once you get it up and running and figured out, it really is impressive. One ongoing complaint however, the updating process (if you want to make a change to a button or function) is pretty time consuming, and requires you to unplug the reciever from the outlet. This can be a pretty big pain if the reciever is plugged into an unaccessable outlet."
2,Battery and charger problems,Followed instructions to correct by placing a piece of paper on bottom side of battery to correct charging problems. Battery cover broke when replaced. Only slightly improved charging. Charge meter always shows a full charge just before it dies. Would not recommend.
1,Logitech support is awful,Bought a harmony 670 remote. It worked fine until I installed the 7.6 desktop software. It no longer recognizes the remote on either XP SP3 or Windows 7. The only support I can get costs me $29 per incident which is 1/3 the price of the unit.I will never buy another of their products.
1,Not worth the money or the effort,"Perhaps my expectations from a programmable universal remote were too high--but this went back in the box and back to Amazon in one day.Buttons are tiny, hard to read, not intuitively arranged. Had to scroll through pages and pages on the remote screen itself to get to the commands I wanted. Software/website was not very user friendly--hard to go back, couldn't get it to add a second room, ""Activities"" were less than satisfying. This remote simply didn't allow me the control I wanted, and to manage only three devices, it just isn't worth the money or the effort."
1,Could not be more unimpressed,"This remote just generally sucks - it never seems to work right - there is always a lag, it rarely turns on or off all the devices as requested - i find it to be more of a hassle than the standard fios remote that came with my cable box - i will have to replace this after a couple years of frustration."
2,good product until you need help,"When this remote is working and once it's programmed, it's fantastic and really simplifies a complex home AV system. However, the set-up can be problematic and requires tech support to access certain programming features. tech support is AWFUL. (2 calls over 140 minutes of hold time!) They say they will call back, but have never done so. And when the product fails (this is our second, both of which lost LCD function unexplicably; ie no drops, spills, or power surges), Logitech simply tells you to buy a new one from them with a 50% off coupon. Unfortunately, buying from them cost almost 2x as much as buying it from Amazon.Again, great product, but TERRIBLE support and problem response."
2,Flawed design,"I have owned both the 880 and the 890 remotes, and after 12-18 months, both exhibit the same problems... first the volume buttons go, then the buttons to the left and right of the LCD, making the remote unusable. Getting support on these has been next to impossible, since they are out of warranty. Very poor design for such expensive remotes!"
2,"returned- couldn't acheive ""universal"" status","After 6h of effort, decided to return. We sometimes turn devices on by hand, and this was never communicated to the remote. Also, we could not get to the point where we felt this remote was truly ""universal""."
3,A great remote (despite some negative reviews),"I am not a computer geek or audio technophile, but had absolutely no problems with set up and programming. Yes, I downloaded the latest software from Logitech, rather than use the provided CD, but it was easy and self explanatory.I have a wall-mounted 50"" plasma TV (operated by IR) and an AV receiver, subwoofer and DVD concealed in a cabinet (operated by RF). All of my components are less than 2 years old. I'm not sure why other reviewers had RF problems, because I encountered none. My programmed TV, DVD and music modes each worked perfectly, right after set up. One button controls all components, setting correct inputs for desired operation.I've been using my 890 for more than a month, and love it! And my wife, who generally hates remote controls, thinks it's great."
3,Not for the technically challenged...,"If you or someone close to you is not comfortable tweeking gadgets to get them to function properly then DO NOT BUY this remote. I am reasonably good at this sort of thing and my remote is still not completely set up, though that is because I keep thinking of new ways to adjust it.The biggest problem was its delay when sending a signal to my TiVo, but after a few hours of searching online I found the answer to that problem and now it works great. There are still a few annoyances (very few), and the price is a little absurd (I got it as a gift and would never spend that much on a remote) but it is really good overall. The design is sleek and satisfying, it is good for days without needing a charge, the buttons aren't overwhelming or obtrusive.Overall it is great for the technologically savvy with a high threshold for frustration. If that doesn't sound like you then go for something more simple to set up."
1,Broke- Bad contacts,I bought one of these about a year ago from Amazon. The battery contacts cheap metal coatings rubbed off between the remote and the charging station and then it would not charge. Why cant they use solid metal contacts? How cheap. Would not buy again.
4,almost perfect,"I have owned this remote for 9 months, I find it to be a fabulous remote, it does exactly what it says on the box. I have also read reviews complaining about the set-up, I don't get it, how hard is it to load the software ( i use MAc) input the model numbers of your gadgets, and VOILA it's done, come on! If you find this difficult, well I am sorry to say but there is no help for you, I just think some people just love to complain. If you are tired of using multiple remotes, these logitech remotes do the trick. Ok you can't control your whole life on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the volume and channel buttons being a little too small and not really obvious for children to pick out, just wish they were painted a bold color to separate them, but that's just me nick picking."
3,Good Remote,"Logitech hasn't quite got this one figured out. The software is kinda of buggy on pc, and the remote's software is real basic. Users use of the remote is quite easy, buttons are real quick to navigate.But the software lacks the power to change any options on remote like constrast and brightness of lcd screen. overall it is a good remote with room to grow via-firmware upgradable."
3,Harmony 890,It works most of the time like it is supposed to. Not sure if i would buy it again. pretty confusing and all the kinks aren't out yet.
1,"neither the 890 nor the ""support"" worked for me","If the 890 remote worked as promised (and as some people experience) I'm sure it would be great. But it didn't work for me. After loading the software, updating it, entering my units (all Sony), and downloading the info to the 890, i found the 890 would not control my receiver or tivo. After an hour of trying to figure it out i called Harmony tech support. Their guy couldn't get the 890 to take input from either my computer or the sony remote, so referred me to their level 2 support. After waiting a half hour for someone to pick up i was disconnected. I emailed tech support, but after 5 days i hadn't heard from them. That's all the hassle i'm willing to put up with, so sent the unit back to Amazon.Amazon, of course, is great about it all - quick response, no hassle, full credit. Gee, why can't harmony take a lesson from Amazon??"
2,"After 1 year, buttons barely respond","There's a known defect with this remote - after about a year, you have start pressing really hard to have the button respond. It got so bad that I opened up the remote and tried to add some bits of rubber band to the inside of the keys to make the press respond. It worked for a few months but now it's barely usable at all. I'm about to buy a new remote now. Do not buy this unless you've figured out that Logitech has fixed this hardware issue.Update: Note that I was able to ""fix"" the remote by opening it again and putting small drops of hot glue on the button points that don't respond. After the hot glue dries it ""raises"" the contact point of the button and it's more easily pressed once you put the cover back on. Don't put too much hot glue though, the cover won't close just right anymore."
2,I WOULD NOT BUY THIS REMOTE AGAIN.,"We bought this remote a few years ago because my wife wanted to hide all of our components in another room. The remote worked satisfactorily at first but when the volume button stopped working properly I started to become dissatisfied, especially when other buttons (about 6 buttons) started to fail. Now the control is not working at all. It my be just the battery but I won't be replacing the battery, I'll be replacing the remote. I spent around $330. for the remote new. Now I don't want to even spend $10 for a new battery because I just don't like the remote. I will be buying something other than Harmony or Logitech.I hope this is helpful."
4,Logitech Harmony 890 solves the problem,"I had to move my receiver and the cable box out of the room with the TV due to lack of space within my TV cabinet for all components. To the basement they went and I decided to get the Harmony 890 to allow me to control all Home Theater components. I installed it yesterday and despite a couple of minor glitches, it works well and solved my space issues. I would recommend it."
3,Harmony 890 at work,"The Harmony 890 functions well with the exception of the size of the control buttons.The buttons are not made for an adult size finger. These are so small it is easy to hit the wrong button especially with the ones you probably use the most such as fast forward, rewind, play and pause.Sure wish they were larger.But I would still buy it again."
4,Nice knife,"a good knife, very happy. What else can I say, just filling up words. Can't say much more than this."
3,beware of the Dream Weaver,"Overall, this isn't a bad collection. However, I was highly dissapointed with the mix of Dream Weaver. I remember listening to the song on the radio in the 70s and thinking that the crescendo keyboards leading up to the ending was a very cool piece of music. Unfortunately, whoever mixed this edit did not(find that ending cool), as the song is quickly faded out 60 seconds pre-maturely. Some decent liner notes accompany the CD as well"
1,Not for Macs,"If you have a Mac, please note this unit is not compatible. Either I missed something or it was not made entirely clear, but look for something else for the Mac."
1,Hardly Ever Works Properly - Don't buy this online,"Ever since I bought it, it has worked improperly. It freezes every 10 seconds or so, then unfreezes, and then the counter resets to zero. Of the 30 or 40 dvds I have tried to watch on it, I only know of 4 dvds that it did not freeze-up on.Don't bother with the replacement plan! It will cost you just as much time and money packaging and shipping this to the service provider. They will not replace or refund any product until they have attempted to fix it several times.Don't lose faith in JVC. My other JVC works fine. I'm sure this was damaged in the shipping process. But that is not an expense you want to incur."
1,this is a cover song,"i had heard the origanial of this song in '88! this is a cover song ok,go on cdnow and READ who wrote this ""song"" NO credit is there! that's because it's a cover song! this song is HIGHLY overrated in it'self! ""friends forver"" is a dillisional song about having a marge show up and saying ""as we go on we remeber all the times we spent together as we go on from whatever we'll always be friends forever"" this song itself gives a FALUSE sense of what REALLY happens after gradutaion! you will NEVER be missed after you leave. hell some schools are so packed your lucky enough if you get in the picture! this song just avoid it it's NOT worth listening to! it's so shallow and arrogant!"
5,Graduation that you will never forget....,The first time i heard this song was in 6th grade when we graduated. This year they played it again and a lot of us cried or just about cried. This song sometimes makes you think about all the fun times at school and sometimes makes you wanna just go back to school. Everytime I hear it i think of all my friends and teachers and how much fun it was(even though you always have homework). Now I can't wait for school to start so we can have another great year!
1,NOT Nokia OEM,"I purchased this cable through Amazon from A-1 Accessories - the packaging is the same as shown in the picture and the driver disk is a CD that has been printed using an ink jet printer. The instructions were printed 8-1/2x11 paper - don't lose them because if you do, you are hosed - you must follow the instructions to the letter - no jumping ahead 'cause you know what you are doing.Nowhere on the driver CD, cable or the package does the word Nokia appear. The Nokia PC Suite off the web WILL NOT recognize this cable unless you install per the instructions and then upgrade PC Suite.I was able to get this thing working, but I had all the planets had to be aligned.Based on the description, I expected a Nokia OEM cable - that is not what I got."
1,Not Worth The Trouble!,"I guess this kind of thing was okay 20 years ago but ""We've come a long way baby"" and this cable is way outdated. First of all, you have to install a program in order to use it, and then it took over our modem. Not worth it when you can simply get a phone with an isb cord and plug that into your computer and ""presto"", your pictures are there. Without the hassle of installing a program and having it mess up your computer. Needless to say, I returned this item."
1,New formula (?) burns my skin!!,"I USED to love this lotion. I have used it for a while with no problems. However, I recently purchased a bottle from a local health store. Very soon after I applied it to my skin, my skin started to burn and turn bright red. I was shocked, because this had never happened to me when using the Alba Very Emollient Unscented lotion. I since have been reading reviews on several sites, and this seems to be a common problem recently.If they changed the formula, they obviously didn't test it on too many people before releasing it. If they didn't change the formula, they now have a major manufacturing issue. I just wish I still had an old bottle so I could compare the ingredients. I do NOT recommend purchasing this lotion until ALBA has resolved this issue!!"
4,"The Consumate ""Blast From The Past""",I listen to songs that I had forgotten. Images of another time (when the song was playing) flash through my mind. It is all very comforting and nastalgic. Great album.
3,Mostly smiles rather than laughs,"This is not the funniest book written by Dave Barry, although it is funny in spots. He lampoons the current business world, the absurdities and incongruities that are a daily part of the life of so many people. As is the case with the best satire, there is a great deal of truth in the exaggerated nonsense that Barry writes. Meetings do dull the mind to the point where you flap your lips with your fingers, the terminology used in corporate America is often the lowest quality double-speak and resumes and press releases are often works of fiction.""Dilbert"" by Scott Adams is considered the bible of corporate misfeasance; it always seems to hit the business world right in the privates. This book is not as good as the Dilbert comic strip; I smiled rather than laughed my way through it."
4,excellent music selection,this Magic Sing chip with addtional songs was an Excellent choice to complement what we have as built in songs.We had a great New Years'eve party with friends and kidsWorth while !
3,Cute but not too entertaining,Purchased this for my daughters first Christmas. It is a really cute set but she was not too interested in it. It did not get played with very often.
3,You get 2 seat covers per order. Don't order 2.,"I received these only 1 day after placing order. Was advised by the customer service that this was a single seat cover, so I ordered two. When they arrived it was in fact 4 seat covers that came. One box has to be returned, hopefully on Amazon's dime. However it is an excellent price for the pair. They look good and the fit is tight."
1,YAWN,"Another dead duck from the flock of booth-whatsit--- another ""design"" loser ---another desperate waste of good paper---another remaindered slab of toss--- another brick in the wallWhy do they bother? Do they think anyone cares?"
3,Bing and Barry Make it Fun-Again,"This is a charming team- up of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald who made ""Going My Way"" such a hit. Bing is a sub-in doctor taking Barry's place in a small town while Barry goes on vacation. The way these two meet on the train is funny and filled with a sense of what can really happen when people start off on the wrong foot. Bing sings, of course, and eventually gets in a zinger about Bob Hope, which you have to pay attention for or you'll miss it. (This was made around the time they were making their ""Road"" pictures. Throughout Bing is smooth and cool, and handles it all. Its fun, light and makes you think about how it must have been back then. No great plot to look for here, but find instead those nuggets of screen ""Crosbyana"" that made him such a much loved star then and still so today."
5,Welcome Home,"I watched this movie last night on the Turner Classic Movie Network. I really enjoyed it, even though I thought it was pretty predictable. Was better than I thought it would be!"
5,Performed well,"Just follow the directions, and make sure you mix the full amount specified, and a very nice finish will result. Note though, that this will act as a glue, so make sure that you segregate any material that you plan to use as a barrier for the depth of the pour. I made that mistake and it took some chisel and sanding work to remove the wood sections I used to retain the mix after I applied it."
3,Not what I expected,I bought this item to make coasters by pouring on tile. I made over 60 coasters on 4x4 tiles. It was a little difficult to use but I expected that from reading the instructions. i was mostly disappointed that I had to use an extremely large amount to get great coverage so that I had no lumps or missing corners. And they're not as waterproof as you'd think they would be. I used pictures with 3-4 coats of dry modge podge over them before I poured and still got red lines in some but nothing major. I used one coaster weeks after so I'm sure it was cured and the glass had a crack in it and leaked on the coaster and it got a huge red watermark on the photo even though the tile was COMPLETELY sealed.I expected this item to seal a lot better.
3,Too Small!,"The inbox itself is fine, but it is just a tiny bit too small. It would likely fit legal sized pieces of paper, but will not accommodate legal size folders. Since all of those legal sized documents that cross my desk are contained in folders, the inbox is of little or no use to me. Even just a quarter inch longer and wider would have been sufficient."
2,Not much in this book!,"Recently I bought the book and I just finished reading it. The Gregorian Strategy is explained in about 10 pages and that's the only value in this book. A blackjack diary of the author(of how he made tons of money in a week) is about 40 pages long or approx. 1/4 of the book. Recommended read only if you have read everything else on BJ. If you are looking for an excellent BJ book, read Blackjack Bluebook II by Fred Renzy."
5,Only book I have read on blackjack with anything new to say,"There seems to be a lot of contorversy over this book, and perhaps some of the reviewers should stick to doing reviews on THE BOOK instead of attacking the writer, but in all fairness, this book is the only book on blackjack that I have ever read that has something differerent to say about the game. I have not tried out this new strategy yet in the casinos but practicing at home with 2 decks shuffled together and after about 20 hours of play I am winning, in fact I am over the theoretical win rate that the author states in the book of 1% with Atlantic City rules. Personally, in my opinion, this book is one of the best or possibly the best, simply by the nature of it offering us a new look at the game, book on blackjack on the market."
3,It's better than the 98 version.,It's ok...I like games that allow users to create their own tracks. The graphics could be a little better. I still like Ricky Carmichael Championship Motocross better.
4,great gate,there arent many choices for gates when it comes to irregular sized doorways but this gate is awesome. i was a little concerned that there might be a potential for squished fingers around the hinges in the gate's door but that is not the case at all. it is made very well - we love it and it keeps my daughter inside her playroom safely.
1,"If you have more than 3 credit cards and an ID, stay away","This wallet is far too small to accommodate credit cards. If you have 1, or two cards, this will do you fine, but if you carry more than 2 cards, stay away. They won't fit, plain and simple."
1,Eelskin wallet from Marshall,"Terrible. Couldn't fit anything in it, and it ripped apart the first day! Piece of junk-poorly designed, and very poorly made."
4,Enjoyable read,As a former Honolulu cop I enjoyed this book because I knew the characters and the scenes. I even got an autographed copy. It flows easily and can be read in one night. Brings back lots of memories if you were one of Honolulu's Finest during that period. I was hoping it would depict some of the sensational homicides but maybe in a follow-up sequel.
1,Liers,"Rhino is a lier, they cut one minute off the song Love Hurts, from Nazareth, how they remaster this cd, from original master tape... with 24 bits...nobory belive, stay away from Rhino"
3,Poor background vocals,"I also enjoyed the song ""Ran Out Of West"" but generally this cd is not really representative of Nick's niteclub sound. I really thought that the female background vocals and the horns got in the way of Nick's tough blues. I also thought the background vocals were horrible on ""Get Too Together"" and ""Highway 1"". ""Don't Feed The Animals"" is a much better example of Nick's sound."
5,Good representation,"I was looking for one particular song and this collection had that song by original group, unlike all other collections I found"
5,"I Love the ""70s","I had been searching for a particular, obscure song that is on this CD for 3 1/2 years. The song is ""Wham Bam Shang-A-Lang"" by a group by the name of Silver. I searched on Napster, etc and could not locate it. Finally, after doing yet another search, I got a hit on Amazon. I had tried Amazon in the past and didn't get any matches in the MP3 files. I guess I should have searched the Music section. Anyway, I ordered it, it came fast and in perfect shape. Another great transaction with Amazon!"
5,Perfect!,"I got these for my 12-year-old nephew. I was worried that they'd be too juvenile for him, but he loved them! He watched them all within days of getting them. My sister told me that I was ""right on"" with this gift. If you know any kids that love animals - this will be the perfect gift for them also! I felt sort of guilty getting acclaim for picking out such a simple gift! National Geographic makes this set seem like it's a lot more than it is. It's not just ""some DVD's about animals"" to him, and I'm sure it will bring a smile to any little face!"
4,Really wild about Really Wild Animals,"National Geographic standards applied to the younger age group. Fabulous photography, age appropriate information, and very catchy songs. Well packaged and each one consistently a quality production. The only downside is they didn't make more of this series."
4,Better than expected.,"I have a difficult time sleeping when there is any noise. So I have tried many, many different types of ear plugs. I would rate this 8/10. Soft enough to mold into shape to insert into ear, yet dense enough to block most noise. Although, I have yet to find one that completely blocks out someones snoring. All in all, pretty good ear plugs."
4,A bit too big for my ears,"The soundproofing is fine, but they actually make my ears hurt after a while when inserted properly because the diameter is too big. Of course this may not be a problem for you. However, I found that the normalHearos Ultimate Softness, 20-Pair Foam (Pack of 2)(the tan colored ones) work just fine for me and block sound very well if used properly."
4,A Place Called Home,It was an o.k. movie. I would not watch it again. The acting was good but it could have been better.
4,The new voice of country,Jeremy Busby is destined to be the next great country star. His soulful lyrics and bluesy interpretation of classic country music makes this a thrilling premier album. I highly recommend this album!
2,Not very good,This is not a very good game. The graphics are poor the game play is not very good. The only thing this game has going for it is it is a rumble pack game which is fun. I think they put all of their development money into liscensing the Nascar logo and driver names.
3,Not Enough,"This is a fun game over-all but it is not enough. It needs real tracks and a nice selection of them, realistic damage, and a real selection of cars."
3,Not Enough,"This game is fun, but it isn't enough. It is fun for people who like racing and don't care about how realistic it is, but for people like me it needs more, as in a real selection of cars and a real selection of tracks, but at least the gameplay is fun which is why it gets 3 stars."
1,Bought it used for under a dollar. May I have my money back?,"Blech. Worst. Voice. Ever. I probably paid about 50 cents for this CD used, and I regret the purchase. One of the few times Amazon's recommendations fell flat. For better music, look at Portishead's Dummy album, or Esthero's Breath From Another, or Morcheeba's Big Calm. Steer clear of Moa. Please."
5,Nice Purchase,Just what I was looking for. Fair price. Quick shipment. Selected red because it is easy to find in purse.
4,Very Nice,"I really like this video. Three short twenty minute yoga segments. One is energizing, one stress relief, and one gentle healing. I find myself reaching for this alot, especially at the end of the day."
5,Daily Dose of Dharma & Danica McKellar,I just started using this DVD and plan to make it a regular routine. My daughter is a personal trainer and a yoga instructor so I was already familiar with some of the poses/stretches.
2,Just a remake of ¿Dónde están...?,"I'm not giving this cd 2 stars because of the music, the songs are JUST GREAT... the only problem is that this album is a live remake of her previous ""¿Dónde están los ladrones?"" -which I would rate with 5 stars- except for 1 track from ""Pies descalzos"". She should have used this opportunity to create something new, to give new life to her first 2 albums (only known in Colombia), to make a cover... she just made a different version of her last album and that's not fair. She's AMAZING, but she's kind of lazy... by now, all the tracks have been great as singles, and we don't have any new material. HIGHLIGHTS: Ojos así, Inevitable."
4,Great Talent,"If you like this CD, it's nothing like seeing her live in concert. Shakira blends lots of high energy with an exceptional, haunting voice. Being from Colombia, I could not be happier for her accomplisments. If you like Latin Pop and Rock, I'm sure you'l enjoy this CD."
1,THE WORST MTV UNPLUGGED EVER.,"I LIKE SHAKIRA VERY MUCH, I THINK SHE IS AN INCREIBLE SINGER AND SHE ALSO HAS A BEAUTIFUL. FROM HER 4 CDS I LIKE THE MOST THE FIRST ONE ""PIES DESCALZOS"".BUT HONESTLY I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A MUSIC LABEL COULD RELEASE I MEAN THIS CD IS THE COPY OF HER ALBUM ""DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES?"",THE SAME SONGS...AT LEAST SHE COULD SANG SONGS FROM HER FIRST ALBUM WICH HAS MANY OF HER BIGGEST HITS OR MABY SHE COULD MADE A COVER, SOMETHING NEW BUT NOT THE SAME, COME ON CHECK THE SONGS...THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTANDHOW COULD SHE WON AN AMERICAN ALBUM FOR THIS ALBUM, I INSIST I LIKE SHAKIRA VERY MUCH BUT I THINK THAT TO BUY THIS ALBUM IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY-BELIVE ME.I WOULDN'T PUT ANY STAR BUT I HAD TO.I HOPE THE SHE EVER HAVE A CHANGE TO MAKE ANOTHER UNPLUGGED TO DO IT RIGHT-I KNOW SHE WILL."
5,I love this woman with all my heart,"Well, what can I say? Shakira is an absolute goddess.I really am not a good music critic (I cannot articulate on things like music), so I will simply tell you what I know: Shakira is an incredible singer, wonderful songwriter, and exciting performer. This is a top-notch performance, here, and I am so lucky to have bought it (it is my first CD by her).""Si Te Vas,"" ""Ciega Sordomuda,"" ""Estoy Aqui,"" and ""Ojos Asi"" are my favourites.Oh, and one last thing: Shakira is NOT the latin Alanis Morissette (although her voice is kinda Alanis-y on Si Te Vas)...Shakira is too talented to be compared to anybody but herself! Also, who the hell said she is the female Ricky Martin? Speaking Spanish does not make you anything like him. Shakira=Cool, artistic hippie. Ricky=lame, conveniently good-lookinglatin atist."""
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"It is a decent program(PC Stitch) and it loaded fine but when I went to use it, it would not work with my version of Windows Vista. It was and older program and I could not find anything on it on the web but again I didn't look that hard.The program is good i'm sure for it's day but I found a newer version and it works really well. I did not try to make it compatible in my current OS."
3,A Bit Disappointed...,"After reading the reviews and noticing how much it was going for, I had to get my hands on this. When I finally did, I was a bit disappointed. Alot of the songs are repetitive, and there wasn't much vocals in the songs. I found myself getting a bit bored not long after the songs played. I'm not new to lounge music either. To me, this album is not worth 50 bucks. I'd say 30 bucks is a decent price for it. I recommend the Bar Lounge Classics albums-most notably the first 3 volumes. They definately give more bang for your buck."
5,Love it,I like this lotion bc it dries quickly. I am very weird about stuff on the inside of my hands - it makes them feel dirty - so I normally just use the backs of my hands to put on lotion. But this dries so quickly that I don't mind it at all.
5,Wonderful !,I purchased this item last year and really wasnt impressed... I thought it wasnt all that great and it didnt do anything for my nails. Much like one of the other reviewers I thought it was conditioner..it really does have a very similar consistently. Just recently I decided that I would REALLY give this stuff a try and use it consistently.. so.. I got a little lotion bottle and I kept this stuff with me and used it throughout the day.. the lotion literally sits on my desk. I did this for about 2 weeks straight and my nails have NEVER looked better.. they have grown out tremendously!!! My actual nail tips were not white at first.. but now they are slowly turning white..and much stronger.. I think this stuff is GREAT !! I thought it was crap at first but if you really give it a try..with consistent use.. you're bound to see results... Great stuff !!
1,Barely a star,Not easy to read at all. I think you would have to be the author to understand the book......
4,good introduction,A very good introduction to linear algebra. Explanations are very clear. A very good exposition on vector spaces. Overall a good buy for starting in this most interesting subject.
2,Disappointing game !,First of all I would like to say that with all the power the Dreamcast can provide the graphics in this game are really choppy. The only thing I really liked was the ability it gave you to plan out your mission and make personal changes as well as equipment changes. However the actual gamepley was awful. The scenery was too plain and first person view mode made it difficult to play. This game has it's upsides but at the same time it has alot of cons that don't make it worth the investment.
4,SPECTACULAR!,"I WAS EXCITED TO KNOW THAT RAINBOW SIX WAS COMING OUT ON THE DREAMCAST. WHEN I FINALLY OPENED THE PACKAGE AND POPPED THE DISK IN MY DREAMCAST I WAS ON A RIDE TO SAVE THE WORLD. IT'S JUST LIKE THE PC VERSION BUT WITH EASIER CONTROL..INSTEAD OF USING A KEYBOARD , NOW YOU CAN USE A JOYSTICK. I LOVE THE GRAPHICS AND REALISM IN RAINBOW SIX. IF YOU PLAYED THE PC VERSION AND LOVED IT..WELL GET READY TO PURCHASE THE DREAMCAST VERSION. I WAS EXPECTING MORE SMOOTH OUT GRAPHICS, BUT WHAT THE DREAMCAST IS GIVEN..I'LL TAKE. IT'S AN AWESOME GAME YOU JUST CAN'T PUT DOWN. IT'S FUN! FUN! FUN!. RAINBOW SIX ON THE DREAMCAST IS AWESOME. IT'S BASICALLY LIKE THE PC VERSION MAYBE ENHANCED JUST A LITTLE BUT WORKS GREAT. SO IF YOU'RE A RAINBOW SIX JUNKIE. CHECK IT OUT ON THE DREAMCAST. YOU'LL ENJOY IT."
2,disappointed...,"The announced release of Rainbow 6 with online multiplayer capability was one of the reasons I originally bought a dreamcast. Unfortunately it is nothing more than a port of the old pc version...without online play. The graphics are poor for dreamcast, the controls are cumbersome, and the enemy AI seems an awful lot smarter than my computer controlled team members. Don't get me wrong...the original pc version at the time was a great game but you should expect substantially more from a new dreamcast version. All in all a disappointment..."
4,good game but should of looked better!,"Im glad i waited to write this review because when i first got this game 5 days ago i thought this game sucked! but now after a few days of playing i've really grew to like this game.well im gonna get the bad issues out of the way first.The graphics look like N64,the control is a little weird at first but after alittle bit there just fine,and the game is 8 months behind schedule so i feel there was no excuse for the graphics!Now the good issues This game is fun,i really like how you can change the mission plans making it feel like the missions outcome is different every time,i also like how you can switch teams during the mission giving this game more depth and stratergy! i also like the audio of you're team members talking back and forth. in the end this is a great game with only a few flaws!"
4,Wonderful... the next best thing to watching the movies!,"This CD contains highlights from Cabaret:1. Wilkoommen2. Two Ladies3. Maybe This Time4. Sitting Pretty5. Money, Money6. Heiraten (Married)7. If You Could See Her8. Tomorrow Belongs to Me9. Cabaret10 Finaleand highlights from South Pacific1. Some Enchanted Evening2. Younger than Springtime3. This Nearly Was Mine4. A Cockeyed Optimist5. Dites-Moi6. A Wonderful Guy7. Honey Bun8. I'm Gonna Wash that Man Right Outta My Hair9. There is Nothing Like a Dame10. Bloody MaryThis CD (and volume 1 which has highlights from My Fair Lady and Fiddler on the Roof) are great to sing a long with, listen to, or have as background music."
2,Good but not what I expected,"While this is a very interesting documentary I must admit that it wasn't what I was looking for. Ever since the advent of DVD I've been hoping to replace my Dark Side VHS concert tape with a DVD version (as you might imagine, the VHS is worn out!). I was so counting on this to be that DVD. I agree with many others that this was a disappointing disc in that regard. The sleeve really is cryptic and while it says ""An in-depth look at..."" I think we are all just conditioned now to believe these in-depth looks are extras, not the main course. I'm sure I'll watch this again and I'll share it with some friends (so they don't fall victim as I did) but how hard would it have been (or be) to put the concert footage on along with the documentary? I'm not sure how much longer my tape is going to last. I'm growing sad."
4,Awesome Sound Quality --- plus insight,"Let me add a comment to the earlier reviews. For those audiophiles like me who used this album to judge each new upgrade or modifications to our stereo systems, you will love the sound quality on your now mature audio system.You get to hear a few very brief individual tracks from the original mix, or a brand new intro from a single instrument by the original artist --- then most of the full song. Make no mistake; no song is played in full. Most are introduced, as this is a documentary; but it has awesome sound and insight! Hearing a short single track really is revealing and brings back fine memories of improving our gear and enjoying a great album.This has always been a special album to me. I have it in every format and I like the sound and convenience of this DVD-Audio. Too bad it is NOT the original album. If they issued DSOTM on DVD-Audio, I would buy it also.I rate this 4 stars. It would be 5 if it was the original album uninterrupted."
4,Great interviews with a few solo sessions,"This DVD basically consists of interviews from the people involved in the making of the album, with a few solo sessions from Dave, Rick and Roger in a studio. They go into some of the mechanics and inspirations for the album. My personal feeling is that the bonus materials are better than the main portion. Dave's, Roger's and Rick's brief solo sessions are very moving. I sure hope more solo material of this nature comes forth in the future. Great stuff!! If you are a Floyd fan, this DVD is a must have in your collection!"
2,Phony baloney!,"I have loved all of Elizabeth Berg's books until this one. Usually her main characters are very realistic - including their faults, their disappointments, their shortcomings. However, the characters in this book are so phony that it is simply impossible to relate to them at all.Guess what? No one's husband is as perfect as this one. Such a human being simply does not exist. No one's marriage is as flawless as this one. Relationships all have ups and downs. No one's friends are as unchanging as these. After years and years of no contacts they just pick up right where they left all - ALL of them??? I don't think so. No one's life is as seemless as this one. A brownstone in Beacon Hill, romantic vacations, early retirements. Give me a break.It was all just too good to be true. It's downright corny."
1,Dreadful,"I couldn't stop listening to this audio CD the way you can't look away from a car crash. Morbid curiosity. My eyes hurt from rolling so often at this jellyfish of a main character.Betta is supposed to be portrayed as a fragile widow, but she just ends up looking incredibly self-absorbed and weak, weak, weak. I can't reconcile her weeping over the perfect husband every five minutes with her late-night behavior with Tom Bartlett. It just wasn't believable.Elizabeth Berg has created such real characters, such as Samantha from ""Open House"" and Myra from ""Never Change."" Their lives were believable, funny, and wistful at the same time. I can't understand how Betta Nolan was created by the same author.The character of her husband was so non-believable that I don't know where to start. ""Welcome to Tuesday, Betta""?????And P.S., many women living in small factory towns in the Midwest can ill-afford cashmere robes, fountain pens, silk pajamas and bird's nests."
1,We learned in high school not to dump friends for boyfriends!,"Ms Berg writes very well. I admit I put the book down half way through. Too much reminiscing. The author could have gotten her message across on how special the deceased was in the first 40 pages. Betta (main character) and her husband were joined at the hip, forsaking all others. Perhaps it's a lesson for all women. Keep your friends. I thought we all learned that lesson in high school."
2,""" WHAT'S UP MS. BERG ? ""","AFTER BEING SEDUCED BY HER EARLIER "" BETTER "" WORKS , THE PAST FEW BOOKS HAVE SLOWLY BUT, SURELY LEFT ME DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NOT SPEND ANOTHER HARD EARNED DOLLAR ON ANY OF HER WRITINGS TIL SHE PROVES SHE HAS RECAPTURED THE CHARMING WRITNG I KNOW SHE MUST STILL POSSESS ...SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE. MY ADVICE TO READERS OF WRITERS LIKE ELIZABETH BERG AND SUE MILLER ( SAME REVIEW OF HER WORKS ) IS , IF YOU WORK HARD FOR YOUR MONEY, THEN GO OR RUN TO NEAREST LIBRARY AND BORROW FIRST. THEN IF I LOVE THE NOVEL I WOULD STILL PURCHASE IT TO RE-READ ON A RAINY AFTERNOON WHEN I AM BERIFT OF NEWER READING MATTER AND HAVE THE COMFORT OF HAVING GOOD WRITINGS FIND A HOME ON MY BOOK SHELVES .MORE ADVICE...WHEN REALLY BEING DISAPPOINTED IN A PUCHASED NOVEL,... PEOPLE , DO DONATE THOSE BOOKS TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY , THEY ARE APPRECIATED AND "" TAX DEDUCTIBLE "" , JUST ASK FOR A PRINTOUT OF YOUR DONATIONS ."
3,Good reading but highly unrealistic,"I have to agree with another reviewer, this book had too many totally unrealistic events happening. Elizabeth Berg is wonderful with words and some of what she said here actually helped me with my own struggle with a life change. However, the fact that her college friends would welcome her back into the fold after not speaking to them for over 20 years is totally unreal. Also, Betta just picks up and moves to the middle of America completely alone and buys a house on the spot. I just don't think this could ever happen. I really like Elizabeth Berg and have read many of her other books. She has an excellent way of describing life situations. I truly enjoy her writing style despite the exaggerations."
2,Good beginning but goes downhill,"I was very annoyed by the end of this book. While it started out interesting and I really liked the character of Betta, about halfway through the book when she moves into the dumpy house with the guy she meets in a coffee shop I lost interest. I found that totally unbelievable. And the whole thing about her friends coming to visit her after not talking to them for thirty years.........give me a break."
5,Good and fresh,Got them to make pesto and ended up snacking on them. They are also the favorite of my 23 yo son.
5,perfect for coffee,"If you use a coffee press this basket works great as a final filter; also works great to brew coffee--simply put ground coffee in the basket, place coffee filled basket in cup and pour in boiling water, let grounds bloom, remove basket and enjoy a perfect cup of coffee."
3,"Ok, at best","It says it's a Large basket, but it actually doesn't even span my Cuisinart coffee pot. It's better suited for a large coffee mug, or small pot. In general, probably worth about $3 max, paying $10 for it makes it not worth it."
3,There are better. top does not stay on,"main problem is that the top floats off, so tea leaves get into the carafe of tea. you need a top that can screw on, so I do not recommend this. so get as big as this but also is attached by a chain to a hook so that you can easily retrieve the container."
1,Poor Quality,This item is of such poor quality that I doubt that it will last much more than a month or two. Every time I use it I wonder that the hot water didn't cause it to melt.
4,The Large IS Large,I ordered the Large after watching a video review posted. I prefer larger mugs and this will fit them perfectly. Extra fine so the bits wont get through when steeping. The only down side is that I wish it had a locking mechanism or like a latch or screw-on method for the lid - the only reason I docked it a star. I would definitely recommend.
4,Good Rx,"Like most Spektrum/JR receivers this one delivers what it promises. The only question is why are they so expensive? If all you have is a foam park flyer, save yourself a lot of money and buy a 6 channel orange reciever from Hobby King."
4,Real life happenings. Totally enjoyed it!,"I totally enjoyed this book. I've experienced a church setting like the one written about in this book. But my eyes are still focused on God, in spite of humans, and our issues. Church is what you make it; your motive for being there."
4,What can I say????????,"This book was so so good. I just couldn't believe the drama, actually I can. I just couldn't believe that things like that happen in the 60's. Church folks is one to pick up and believe me it is good. I love the storyline between the two main characters and those that knew them. This one is very funny, entertaining and full of things about the carnal mind of church folks. Thank God for the Christians in this book."
2,Did I Miss Something!,"I was really disappointed with this book. The substance was very weak. I grew tired by the middle of the book of the too detailed descriptions of attire, hair and skin color, which if removed from this book there wouldn't be too much of a story left. I've had enough of the lightskin, straight hair bashing. Let it go!"
4,Reality of Church Society,"This book was full of good down home church humor. The book basically focuses on a new young pastor who makes a decision to get married. However, there is something in his past that attempts to disrupt his marriage. While this book is fiction, it seems to have a lot of truth in it. I don't believe that the author pulled everything she wrote out of her imagination and creativity. However, she does an excellent job of painting the picture of a pentecostal church service in the South. The mood of the book causes you to feel like you are actually in the church services or any of the social activities discussed. The book has a very unique ending. Overall, it helps you to really understand that members of the clergy are as human as anybody else and should be treated like so."
5,A book to accompany your life,"Robert Grudin's ""Time and the Art of Living"" is about how we exist in time, and the role time plays in our lives, for better if we make productive use of it, or for worse if we ignore it. Not a self-help book, it is nonetheless a book that I come back to every several years, both for its accessible erudition and for its suggestions for giving shape to your life in time. Highly recommended."
5,Top Reveiw - Time and the Art of Living,"A friend gave me a copy of this book more than 10 years ago and I keep ""losing"" my copy to friends. The book is full of wisdom and is wonderfully written. I probably have read the book a half a dozen times and have read selected passages more than a few dozen times! The ""Achievement"" section has been particularly valuable for me."
4,Great Book,One of the better entertaining books I have read in many months. I thought the ending was quite good because it kept you guessing about who was the killer
4,Suspense,"This book kept my attention (on the edge of my seat, attention) from beginning to end!If you like a suspenseful mystery, it is a must read."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This was a real cliff-hanger. It's not too often I read a thriller that causes me to holler out loud, ""Oh no, don't go there!"" But this one did. I was on the edge of my seat as it drew to a very unexpected and dramatic close. Don't miss this one. I absolutely couldn't put it down."
4,Night Prey,The book kept my interest all the way through very entertaining. It made for a quick read and was well written.
4,A Great Slice of Black History,"I always wondered about this man, whom I've been reading about for years. this book gives you wondeerful insight into how Johnson Publication, one of the first black companies became so successful and the odds against him. Interesting reading."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ONE,"Used 3 times. Stopped working - power button, nothing. I should have read the reviews. Sylvania, I'll never purchase another one of your products."
1,It broke within a week of getting it.,"You ever have a computer crash on you? When it just locks up and freezes and the mouse and keyboard don't respond. Well, that's kinda what happened to this device. Within about a week of getting it the remote control stopped working, the on/off button wouldn't work and the controls on the machine stopped working. I left it off for a few hours and I turned it back, that helped for a few days but then it stopped working again. I tried keeping it unplugged when not using it, only plugging it in when I wanted to play it, but that didn't help. I plugged it into a different socket, still the same. It finally just stopped working so I returned it to the store where I'd bought it and the clerk there said that a lot of customers were returning this product! I ended up purchasing a more expensive DVD/VCR combo. Take my advice; don't bother with this model. It's no bargain if it doesn't last!"
2,Item does not work,"The item does not work. No sound, and VHS will not work at all. I plugged everything up according to the information sent with the item but to no avail. I am very dissatisfied and dont think I will be purchasing from this person again."
5,Does the job,It is getting harder to find VCR/DVD combos. The main thing that attracted me here was the price. It was much cheaper to buy this new than repair the old one. And it does the job very well.
1,"Televisions need ""video out"" jack to record.","After much trial and error and unhelpful instructions I called Sylvania customer service to inquire how to record. I was told that my television needed a ""video out"" jack to connect to the VCR"". I explained my television didn't have a ""video out' jack to which the customer service rep replied; ""most don't, you'll need to get a cable box to connect the two."" My option was to then pay 50 some dollars a month for cable just so I could record on a machine labeled; "" Video Cassette RECORDER"" or return the device. I returned it the next day."
1,Glad I read through it before reading it to my children!,"I picked this book up last week at a homeschool convention. My oldest son is very interested in history and learning about the explorers. We have enjoyed books by this author before, so I felt like it was a good buy. I can't believe how blatantly anti-Christian the author is in this book. She makes Christians sound like the wart of the world! She makes it sound like the world progressed in knowledge and achievements in spite of Christianity. Although I am no history expert, some of her statements just didn't sit well with me, and I would really question whether what she wrote is fact or just her ignorant, prejudiced opinion. I will never purchase another book by her again."
1,Waste of Money..,upset with this YOYO..Forget about kid playing with this. Its hard for me too.Poor thread quality.Thread slips alot while looping back.
4,The product was nice except....,This was made in Mexico...Sorry I am a traditional person and this should have been USA made. The product was fine but the origin was not. I sent it back.
1,POS for the EOS,"I would expect a Canon 5D accessory to be made better than this. Then, on its maiden voyage during the 4th of July fireworks, the stupid piece of snot (POS) didn't work. Thinking maybe I had to put a battery in it or something, I tried to open the case. That was impossible, and so now it's in the trash. I'll have to pay more now to get the cable release that actually works, even if it gets bad reviews on its quality too. I can't figure out how it could be compatible with the 5D and then not function."
2,its not what you really expect for a good camera,i thought this product has image stability but nah most of the picture i take is blurred and the quality of picture is no good even you adjust on the menu itself.i regret buying this product sometimes the cheapest one wont give you any satisfaction at all.
2,Gift for my step daughter,One problem. Less than 6 hours after taking it out of the box a small pink dot showed up on the display screen. While not transfered tot he pictures it was still anoying. The local Target store would not exchange it for another because I bought through amazon.
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this box set as a birthday present. I recieved the wrong set (Best of the 40's) in the mail and had to pay for return shipping. I asked for them to re-send the correct box set and instead they refunded my money without contacting me prior to this transaction. There is no telephone number to contact this provider and an automated server responds to e-mails. As a result,I will never do business again with Moviemars."
1,MR. ROSE URBAN FACTS COULD BE FICTION,"A short, yet boring story. The facts are not all there. Poorly written, and just a waste of paper. Save your money and go to a couple of movies.Mr. Rose needs to go to school on how to write, as his skills are very amateurish to say the least."
5,Great!!!,"This book is great! It discusses some very serious matters, and it is not an easy book to tackle. However, it is very enjoyable to read, as Hofstadter augments each subject with examples from very diverse sources. The joy of discovering the puns and other playful gems hidden in the book is part of what makes it so special. Anecdotes, word plays and Zen koans are additional aspects that help make the 777 pages an experience that many readers consider to be a turning point in their lives. Other books I liked are Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusions and Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works."
2,"Interesting Hypothesis, however non factual",Godels' Theory is just that. Theory. Nothing is proven although some enlightening mathematical juxtipositions are called into play. It is highly entertaining. But I would not call it life changing. I would be very malicious if I did not maintain a skeptical view of this work.
3,Godel Eternally Bandied Eventually Gets Boring,"If you're new to computer science, then this book introduces you to some interesting topics in decideability and recursion. These ideas have implications for people who contemplate the possibility of intelligent computers or the design of intelligent systems.Since most of the computer science theory is over 50 years old, none of it is new to anyone who is familiar with the subject. That said, the presentation is a rather weak play on Lewis Carroll combined with the cloying childishness of A. A. Milne.Most readers claim to find the book fascinating. They're either genuinely fascinated by the AI topics, which are great - just not the author's own ideas. Or they're faking it because you're supposed to say you like stuff that sounds clever. Or they're faking it."
4,All right.,"I don't know, this took me about a week to finish. A good book to read if you want to know what Godel was thinking about besides CTCs ."
4,Worth the money,Had trouble using it at first but found out I needed to update the firmware on my player then worked great! I live in a large city and had no problem finding stations to use. Definitely worth the money.
3,"Worked great, for a week....","I received the SAN-360 FM Transmitter & Charger as a gift for Christmas. It worked very well, for about a week and a half. I plugged it in this past week and found that it was not transmitting correctly. It sounded as if only the background parts of my music were coming through clearly. I keep my transmitter in my car, along with my cell phone charger. I live in New England so I'm not sure if the transmitter was affected by the cool winter temperatures or not. I'm sure this is not a common occurance, but I would advise anyone with the transmitter not to leave it in their car in extreme temperates (hot or cold). I have contacted Maximo about my problem - and hope to find out if it was a fluke, or if the cold temps killed my transmitter... I'll update later if/when I hear from them. :)"
2,Find another advanced VB book...,"If you're looking for a textbook to teach you advanced VB concepts, find another one. This book is boring, has no flow to it, and is a pain in the you know what to use as a reference. The author likes to use big words for the sake of using big words (words that could be easily and more appropriately substituted for simpler ones). Get this book if you want to sleep through your homework time."
2,Unpleasant people bicker for 300+ pages,"This is the story of two estranged daughters who must band together when their elderly father suddenly decides to marry a Ukranian gold digger some fifty years his junior.This book pulled me in immediately. Loved the quirky title, loved the beginning. Thoroughly enjoyed the first few chapters. But gradually, I lost interest. Such an unpleasant group of people - nobody to care about. The same conversations or jokes repeated over and over. So many lists: what was growing in the garden, lying on the floor. It became tedious. The reviews applaud this as a comic novel, and there are parts that are amusing, but it's very much black humor rather than the laugh out loud and read-excerpts-aloud-to-your-husband kind.I know this book has been extremely popular and nominated for numerous awards which puts me very much in the minority but I just didn't get it."
3,promised much but waned,"Had things not become so ridiculous toward the end, I would have taken this generally well written book much more seriously.The characters are interesting, as are their stories, and truth be told, I am still thinking about them and mulling over the book 2 weeks later. It's not what I thought it would be on many levels, but it is a good reminder of what Stalin did to the Ukraine and indeed,all of the former USSR."
3,This is not a comedy,"This is a well written book about the plight of Ukranians at the hands of the powers that be. It is the sad stories of the historical characters as well as the current characters. This family is disfunctional, not typical of all Ukranian families. The abuse the old man takes at the hands of the young,selfish, misguided and for brief moments pathetic Valentina, is difficult to read. The saving grace is the understanding that evolves through the development of the story for some of the characters. It is a study of human nature in the face of adversity."
3,Great stuff but... why the tractors?,"I'm not sure why I don't give this book a better review. There is much wonder in this novel: the narrator is immensily human, her father's patheticness endearing, and the rivalries with sister and ""step mother"" fabulously described. The gradual revelation of the family origins and journey from ""Ukraina"" to Britain are rivetting.I am glad other Amazon reviewers appreciated it plenty. But though I found ""Short History.."" well-written, fun and original novel, somehow I think Lewycka still has her best book ahead of her.I think what bugs me about the book are the sections on tractors. Perhaps they account for part its originality, or serve as a clever literary technique. However, too me, the main plots, those involving the current family situation and the flashbacks of the family history, are infinitely more powerful. I need some explanation why the book needed those tractor treatises at all."
5,A Gem of a Novel,"This isn't a particularly long novel, yet Lewycka manages to accomplish so much! The story-line itself is simple: two estranged sisters in England try to stop their aged father's marriage to a gold-digging Ukrainian woman. But the book itself is complex. It's one of the funniest books I've read in a long time, and there is joy, and yet there is also plenty of tragedy and grief. All of the characters are wonderful; even some of the minor supporting characters are fully realized people. And none of the characters are fully good or bad. The author even had me sympathizing at times with the gold-digger and the men with whom she had affairs. I think the book's greatest asset, however, is that it shows genuine insight into real families, and the sorts of complicated stories that families make for themselves. How many books can make you laugh, make you cry, and teach you about the history of tractors and the Ukraine, all in less than 300 pages?"
3,More for women maybe?,"I'm an older man who likes both women and tractors! A book about an old timer who loves tractors and falls for a young blonde who apparently likes him? Hello! Sounds promising me thinks. But now half way through it and wonder if I can stomach finishing it. The book can't seem to make up its mind whether its a comedy or a private memoir for family. But what stands out is so much female mind streaming or prattle between women; brimming with little details that just aren't that important to men - well, men like me anyway. I'll add to this if I complete the book."
3,Not about tractors - or is it?,The actual history of tractors is interwoven with a story of an old man who seems to have been hoodwinked into marrying someone from Ukraine. Is it really love? Is it rescue? Or is it something in between that motivates all of the characters in this book? This book has an unusual title and premise and yet it was an enjoyable read. The characters are fleshed out nicely and the tractor history can be looked at as symbolic of relationships and how they appear to be made for one thing and end up being used for another. Not the best book of the century but certainly worth the purchase.
5,Shanghai's spectacular 19th & 20th century western architecture,"A fabulous and unique pictorial that preserves the amazing buildings erected by Westerners in China's most fashionable and cultured city. Clubs, apartment buildings, private residences...the architecture reflects the expatriate experience of the foreign community. A most laudable and impressive volume."
4,John Blinn's PORTRAITS CD,"John Blinn's PORTRAITS CD provides innovative, easy listening for a wide range of music lovers. In PORTRAITS he reveals many refreshing sounds that put people on the same wondrous plane as the places we encountered in his world-travel music from ON THE ROAD 1, 2, and 3 CD's and GOING AGAIN. The music helps me feel as good about the sounds as he obviously does about the friends, acquaintances, and just folks he encountered in his travels around the world. They are varied, interesting, andnice to get to know. One of the few vocal insertions in of one of the songs captures John's fascination about and care for diverse people and places--there was a soft, warm exclaimation, ""Oh, I love it!"" My sentiments about the CD."
2,Good for a year,"This pump worked for one year. It was under 18"" if water in Richmond AV where the top of the pond developed a thin film of ice. It worked until last week. The pump runs but does not push any water. I have cleaned it as well as I can. I set the pump in a bucket of water and plugged it in. The impeller turns but no water comes out. I will have to buy a new pump, but it will not be this one."
4,pond pump,"great product, although it arrived a few days after it was promised. Also it is not as pictured. The actual pump ended up working for what I had in mind, but I did base my purchase on the photo next to the item on Amazon, and it was not at all what was pictured. The good news is that the pump that was sent has its own filter system that made the pictured box filter unnessesary so 0verall I am happy with my purchase after initially assuming they had sent the wrong thing. Whats with that photo? It is not even close to what the product looks like?"
1,Not So universal,"Well Built, Looks Great, Won't Fit Some 17"" Laptops.. Wont fit Hp Dv 9000 Series computers... Base is not deep enough.."
3,Not For Laps,"Three stars is really a compromise rating. If you use your LAPtop on your DESK, I am sure this is probably an excellent product, probably worthy of 4 or 5 stars. I, unfortunately, bought a LAPtop to use in my LAP. For LAP use, this product is a 1 star. Using this product in my lap, the fans were positioned exactly over my legs, making them useless. If I moved my legs so the fans could work, the sharp metal edges dug painfully into my legs.If you intend to use a LAPtop in your LAP, a closed back unit will be much more comfortable to use. (I'm hoping)"
4,Cools wonderfully and is very quiet,"This notebook cooler works well and is very quiet. However, it remains on when the computer is turned off, unless you push the button to turn it off. My other one turns itself off when the laptop is turned off. At least, when it remains on, it is so quiet that I can't hear it unless there is absolutely no other noise in the room."
4,Excellent product!,"Bought this for my MacBook Pro 17"" laptop, which runs really hot, up to 148 degrees. I now feel no heat and the two fans are incredibly quiet. The cooler does not lower my computer temperature, but as I said I don't feel the heat and my Mac store tech says not to worry about the temperature. Being a little on the cautious side, I turned up my computer fan speed to 6000 rpm which makes significantly more noise using SMC fan control (freeware).My temperature now runs in the low 90""s. It's not the most comfortable on my lap, seems to be designed more for placing on a desk. But, no heat to my body and quiet fans make this an excellent product. It is slightly wider than my 17"" and slightly less depth but nothing serious. I have bought other Cooler Master products and have been quite happy with them all."
3,Worked Great for 2 months!!!,"Thought this thing was the best thing ever . . . until it went kaput after only 2 months. Worked like a charm up until then. Not sure of the life span for these things, but if it's only 2 months, I recommend going with something cheaper. Works great though."
5,Shakespeare's trollop,Great book! Reading on the kindle makes it more enjoyable and you breeze through it. It makes hours feel like minutes
3,TERRIBLE Kindle formatting,"The fourth novel in this series was a little predictable, and therefore a little boring, since they've all followed a very similar pattern. I'm also getting a little sick of Lily's judgemental, sanctimonious attitude, whether it's aimed at interracial relationships, mildly adventurous sex, or anything else.However, Harris's writing tends to make me ignore all that. What I couldn't ignore was the TERRIBLE formatting in the Kindle version. There were typos on nearly every screen, giant spaces where there shouldn't have been, misplaced punctuation marks, and so much more. It's hard to stay focused on a story when you're constantly being distracted by errors.Check it out from the library, but avoid this awful Kindle version."
3,"Loved It, Now Not So Sure","I purchased this in Dec. 2007 and was very pleased with:ease of setup, picture quality and color tone. Am a bit ofa cheapskate, so boosted the rather low sound with computerspeakers and the headphone jack...It even played a DVD I'dcreated in iDVD w/ no troubles at all ;-)Was worried about buying my first 'combo' as it seems one part alwaysseems to fail...Have been having major problems the past couple of weeks with the DVD player:skipping, freezing, and just not working well at all! Cleaned discs,ran cleaning discs through the player - nothing is helping. Hauled-outmy former DVD player to check a particularly troublesome DVD- and no playback/freezing at all! [All were movies / store-bought.]Read some other reviews where folks have DVD's permanently stuckin the mechanism...unfortunately, I think that's where mine is headed!Will keep my fingers crossed - and the old player setup just in case."
2,Intolerable overload distortion,"A critic I admired back in the day RAVED about this recording, both for the singing by the principals and conducting by Mehta. I bought the LP highlights. Domingo autographed my copy. Imagine my disappointment to hear distortion on almost every loud note. I assumed a bad pressing, since that was common from RCA in those days. When the CD set was released, I bought the whole opera expecting to hear high quality sound. Crap. The distortion is less, but still noticeable. It suggests either overload distortion caused by too high a recording level or else inferior quality master tapes. Despite the excellent performances, the distortion makes it unlistenable."
2,Little Black Book,"Overall the book was ok. Honestly I was expecting a bit more from a so called ""Vegas Insider"". It did have a few helpful tips, and the rating systems for the hotels and Gentleman's Clubs were helpful in selecting where to stay and what to do. I would not pay more than $10 for it again, and it should be updated yearly, if for no other reason than things change so often in Vegas."
4,"I like design, but I don't like heavyness .","Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Infant Car SeatThis car seat is great, however, I wouldn't advise to buy it if you want the car seat for baby from birth to 12 months. After 6 months your baby practically wouldn't fit. I bought it bacause my friend recommended. She told that her little girl loved the car seat until 1.5 y.o. My son was fine since first days... now, he is almost 5 months, and I noticed he doesn't feel comfortable in it. Plus, belts are very short, of course, they won't fit after one month. One more thing, the car seat is very heavy, I can't carry it. Only my husband does."
4,A First Course in the Finite Element Method,"I've only skimmed throug the book, Of what I have seen on the first chapters it looks good due to having a fair amount of examples. So far I think I can learn this material on my own with this book, regardless of ever taking FEA in College."
5,Blue Skys and Love at Sea,"This is truely a romantice story. It reminds me of some everlasting love in a movie or soemthing. Its great, keep writing more I cant wait to see the next one!!"
2,Enough with the world music already,"When I first heard this cd, I was impressed with Walk Dance and Cumba Quin. While these are still very good, they simply don't make up for the rest of the disc of what is essentially easy listening guitar music. York drifts all too easily into New Age, and the longer pieces, which I thought would reveal intricacies over time, seem to go on forever, but go nowhere. There is no passion or emotion in this music. Even the tune Farewell, which is a lovely haunting piece, seems a bit cold when compared to the Assad's version. After two cd's worth of this stuff, here's one former fan who hopes they head into more substantial, though not necessarily well-trodden territory. Maybe Leo Brouwer could write something for them...?"
1,waste of money and my time,"I find this book quite apauling from the academic point of view. I have taken a prticular interest in the Balkans some years back when I met a Slovenian friend in Prague in 1988. Since then I have followed Balkans closely and have done an extensive research on its history. Anzulovic, for whom I suspect is a Croat himself based on my knowledge of the Slavic last names, has done a great misservice to himself and his readership. He only uses data which supports his inflated claims, and overlooks the historical reality. One of these ""minor"" historical realities he fails to mention are 297,100 Serbs who were cleansed from Croatia in 1995 and some 250,700 Serbs cleansed out of Bosnia the same year. Unlike Anzulovic, I do not make up my figures - these were taken from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees Report for 1996. But that may be too credible of a source for Mr. Anzulovic."
4,exhaustively documented anti-Serbian tract,"If at all based on objective fact, this book is a damning indictment of Serb culture, in particular the glorification of violence and xenophobia through interwoven state religion and nationalistic literature. I assume the author is Croat, which must detract from the force of his attack on Serb culture. However his documentation seems very thorough!"
1,Too Salty for Non-Dutch,"Don't buy this if you're American and you think you like salty things.Don't buy this if you love licorice, but have never tried Dutch double salt licorice.Buy this if you want the saltiness of the Dead Sea packed into a tiny drop of something vaguely resembling licorice."
3,Dropping the Bomb,"Roth enlightens the reader with trying to abolish preconceptions as misconceptions. We see that nothing is as simple or shallow as it seems; yet, is all the glove-making and beauty-queen blabber page after page necessary? ""American Pastoral"" seems to give us a presentations of ideas in Roth's mind, but offers no salvation at the finale. Too many loose strings for a novel that has been exalted by the Pulitzer. The Swede's pathetically passive personality would personally drive me to the point of rebellion as well. I found myself lost somewhere among Roth's rambling mazes of oblivion: Where did Zuckerman disappear to? Was Rita Cohen even an existent character? How did Merry go through a metamorphosis from being a violent, raging, radical bomber to a transcendent compassionate Jain? Hmmm...I', left mesmerized by the mediocrity... ""Jesse Orcutt, let's go have a drink - Scotch on the rocks, my treat!"" Philip Roth certainly didn't feed me with a treat in reading this novel."
