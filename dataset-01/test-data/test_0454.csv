5,Great from beginning to end!,"If you are a fan of sci-fi, get this immediately. Basically a story of a man driven insane by his obsession, in this case solving the secret of the stock-market through math-matics. Throw in some corporate gangsters, and Hasseed in the mix and your in for a great ride. Buy it now."
5,Pi Is Random,"Um, this film was apparently loosely based on an article in The New Yorker by Richard Preston (the The Hot Zone guy) about two brothers named Chudnovsky who used a home-built supercomputer to calculate Pi to half a billion digits. They did this to prove their algorithm works, and to see if Pi is ""normal"" as a random number, I.E. 10% of its digits are 1's, 10% are 2's, etc., and the Chudnovskys won on both counts."
3,Disturbing and hard to follow,"Pi was, is, and always will be, a movie not meant for the masses. The plot is hardly one that most can sympathize with. A disturbed, neurotic mathematician with schizophrenic tendancies spends his life trying to find a fantastic number that is not only the name of God, but is also the key to unlock important patterns in life.Visually, the movie is difficult to follow. The grainy black and white print is difficult to interpret for one who is used to crisp digitally edited prints. The movie looks like something that would be screened on a wall in an art museum.The soundtrack is wonderful, and creates a sense of eerie unreality. The techno may annoy some, but creates the proper mood of loneliness.All in all, a well made movie with a plot that's hard to relate to, and pictures that are occasionally difficult to understand. But doesn't it have a killer ending? :)"
5,"If you didn't like it, you didn't understand it.","WOW! This one makes the top ten favorite of all time. A movie that was different from anything I have seen, highly recommended for anyone with an IQ above a 4th grader. I can see by some of the negative reviews that this film was not understood by these people. Poor ignorant slobs."
1,Does NOT live up to its hype,"I had heard a lot of really good things about this movie. Several different people all recommended it to me: ""It involves math and science fiction; you'll like it."", ""It's off-beat and weird; you'll like it."", and ""It's unique and makes you think; you'll enjoy it.""Nope, can't say that I did. It dragged in the story. It didn't make much sense at any point. I barely found the characters interesting. And the ending was a relief that I no longer had to watch the drudgery of a film rather than the satisfaction of an entertaining movie.Maybe I just missed the point of the film. Maybe it really was entertaining. But I would rather slide down a razor blade into a pool of iodine than watch this a second time."
1,Purchased based on these reviews,"And what a mistake that was. I'm into artsy, obscure movies but this was a complete waste of time. The black and white picture quality was very poor at times. I don't know if they were going with the gritty look or not, but it didn't work. The movie was just boring and painful to watch. And now I'm wasting time writing a review for this and I'll just leave it at that."
4,I'll explain...,"This movie is confusing and very good if understood fully. its about a mathematician with a goldfish named after a famous mathematician of the (i think) 20th century. this guy, max, suffers from paranoia, due to all his thinkings and accurate perception of everything around him. the movie is filmed in black and white, so it gives that gloomy feeling. he in the movie, is in search of the rest of numbers to the formula called PI in math, which start with the munbers 3.14...and it keeps going. i feel that this number is infinite, that is why the end of the movie is the way it is. THERE IS NO ANSWER. anyway, i gotta go. see the movie."
2,Depressing and exhausting,"Primary theme: Pursuing some knowledge can be devastating.This movie is a dark and depressing experience.I think the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" explored the same theme but in an enlightening way."
1,Not for Parties,"I saw this movie with about 6 friends who came over for a DVD party. I bought the DVD based upon good reviews. However, the consensus of the group was that this movie SUCKED. We barely made it all the way through - and the ending is the worst part, I think. One other reviewer mentioned that you need to watch it several times to really get it. Ok, maybe, but don't see it with a group of people or you will all be staring at each other after it's over and then looking more pointedly at the person who picked it!"
2,"A lot of build-up, not much payoff.","Not a bad little film, but the best part about the disc is the groovy cover. The visuals have a tendency to give me a headache, especially on a larger screen, and the story, though interesting, just had too many ""menacing"" characters that seemed about as threatening as a night at the Bingo parlor--realistically you know the possibility of danger exists, but you're primarily concerned with other issues. In all honesty, this seems a lot like a film for people who WANT to like independant, ""revolutionary"" film. If you want better cinematography, watch anything from Robert Rodriguez, if you want better dialogue, watch anything from Quentin, if you want better storytelling, read a book."
2,The Shallow Depths,"The first half of this film is suggestive and intriguing. The second half becomes concrete and, while not exactly dull, let's say that the tremendous possibilities of the opening collapse to a single and rather prosaic storyline. By doing some, albeit limited, research into mathematics, Aronofsky succeeds in evoking the mystery in maths' connection with the ordinary world - however, a little more research or imaginative effort might have powered the film to still greater heights. This adds up to a shallow take on a profound subject, and it trades on the subject's genuine profundity in order to gives itself airs. Still many of the techniques rehearsed here see fruition in 'Requiem for a Dream', the latter being a much more satisfying piece of work."
5,I'm so glad I picked up this one!,"This is a movie that I hadn't heard a thing about, but decided to take a chance on and rent it. Man am I glad I did. As a huge movie lover, this movie came out of nowhere and is now one of my favorites of all time. The randomness and bazar camera work just drew me in and kept me from wanting to blink. This movie is beautifully written and has an amazing way of coming together. This is a must see. If you have any kind of inteligence, you won't be let down!"
1,Pi,Very poor movie. Not recommended. Certainly does not rate anything over one star. I selected it on its subject matter and having four stars from other viewers. It clearly shows the low budget available. It was a waste of DVR space and $2.99.
4,Pi,"I received this movie and enjoyed it very much. Thank you for your promt and courteous response.Sincerely,Mona Ghaffari"
1,this film is a indie in a bad way,I hated this movie! The idea was good but the actual production was horrible.The acting was bad and all the actors played two dimensional empty parts and overall the movie was long and boreing. But the idea was good.
5,Giving Voice to My Sentiments,"Bruce Lesnick gives an artful, soulful voice to my feelings as a parent and as an American horrified by what our government is leading us into. Bruce's words and delivery are thoughtful and powerful, even though he has a calm and gentle sound. I can only hope -- and this was my overwhelming sense when I first heard the CD -- that his music will inspire and mobilize people (and other musicians and songwriters!) against the warmakers the way the music of the 60s and 70s did for millions of us then."
3,Pretty good for the price.,"Not super high quality, but better than the Casio watches I have bought. Looks great and is easy to adjust. Seems to eat batteries fast."
5,Immortality suits a Viking,"This is the excellent story of a man who returns to where he started from only to know the place for the first time. The man is an immortal Viking, telling his tale to Ancient-Mariner-Style captive audience... The wealth of genuine Norseness about all this overwhelms the disbelief. The presence of a sly sense of humour, much in vogue among Vikings apparently, tends to make the journey fast moving, poetic, funny, violent, sexy and entertaining all the way. Don't miss this one"
3,Read the French Edition of this book.,The only real problem I have with this book was that the American edition has been abridged. Over 150 pages have been cut. As a result much of the portrait of Camus as a philosopher has been deleted. So I would recomend reading the French edition if at all possible
2,"A disappointing ""Best of""",I should have done more research before I bought. I'd hoped this would be a concise and exciting introduction to Hawkwind. I now know that this CD is mostly not their best work.
2,Wouldn't recommend,"This book didn't give me any unique ideas for decorating my Florida home. I expected to find some unusual interiors that played on the beach, sand, tropics theme but was disappointed with both the photos and the text. It seemed more focused towards the Asian and oriental themes than towards what I was expecting as ""tropical"". I wouldn't recommend it to anyone seeking tropical ideas or inspiration for their home decor."
2,short,"i have found that the hp and motor books have too many non tech pictures large print and few pages,a picture of a guy holding a grinder to me is not information!!!!!"
5,Gay erotica at it's finest,"What a great book, this is one that you just will not be able to put down once you have started it, Luc Milne does a great job on introducing the characters and you will find that there is at least one that you can identify with.The 2 main characters could not be different at the start and it was quite a twist as to what happened to them at the end !His imagination runs wild throughout the book and he touches on what seems to be part of what every guy fantasises about at some point, be he straight or gay, the book does tend to lose it's way towards the end though, coming across as though either he rushed the ending or that he has left it open for a sequel.I for one will be looking out for Cocksuck Academy II !"
4,All the songs are uniques and differents,"I like all the songs in this CD, specially the music.The only thing that might be better is, to separate the Kid's song from the Political songs."
2,basic,"Overwritten; period. McNaught seems to be trying to impress us with yawning details on almost everything; especially Hollywood and it's lists of actors. Enough! This book could've been written much better; covered the same plot, and done in 1/2 the ink/paper. I found myself skimming constantly, just to keep from dying of boredom before we moved on in the book."
5,McNaught's best book is a welcome escape!,"I love all of Judith McNaught's books, but this one is my favourite. The plot, the characters, the dialogue... every part of this book makes it not only a great escape, but engaging reading too! I normally feel kind of detached when I'm reading something, but this book not only made me laugh out loud several times, but I even cried at certain parts.Ms. McNaught really has a talent for making her stories come alive, and Perfect is no exception. If you haven't read any of her stuff yet, I strongly suggest trying this one out. It may be a fluffy romance novel, but it's still one of the best written books I've ever read."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I don't want to spend $20 on a brand new book when it might be total garbage. So when I finally purchased this book years later it seemed extremely dated. I don't want to hear about actors from the past who are no longer popular and I don't want to hear about bad fashion that I'd rather forget about. I cringed a lot throughout this book. This is the exact reason that I read historical fiction.Even if I could get past all of the cheesiness of this book it still would not be my cup of tea. The hero was the biggest jerk I've seen in a romance in a long, long time. Women do make seriously bad choices sometimes but I'd rather not read about it in my romances. Not recommended for any reason."
3,Forgiveness is a hard thing,"I loved the characters of this well written love story. Zach and Julie are beautiful and vivid. I did not give this book 5 stars because I do not believe Julie would do what she does to Zach, maybe lose faith but not that big of a betrayal. I'm actually having a hard time forgiving her, I don't believe Zach could either. But I did not write the book, so oh well. Still the author is awesome in her detail. By the way Judith, lets wrap up Paul's story please, poor guy."
5,A truly amazing trance compilation!,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite trance CDs. I havealways liked Armin's mixes, and he really does a wonderfulcoherent mix, especially in the first disc.The mixing is simply superb! I always turn up the basson my music system a notch especially when ""Under the Sun""starts, the beginning of the song is just amazing. Of-course,my favorite Oceanlab is there with Justine Suissa at the vocals.Satellite is such a beautiful song, I just love it. I alsolove Fictivision's Escape... which follows another of myfavorites, Velvet Morning.This is truly a great trance album, I personally think Armindeserves a pat on the back for his effort. I keep this CD rightnext to my other 3 favorites, ""A Trip in Trance"", volumes 1-3.Nicely done, Armin, can't wait for your next release!"
3,Pretty Good,"I give this album about 3 and 3/4 stars.I owned the first 6 tracks of this 2 cd set for over a year, and listened to them all the time. They sounded fresh and pretty original but not so out of the mainstream as to be inaccessable to most trance fans ~ So I shelled out $20 and bought it finally. The rest of the two CD's arent exactly what I was hoping for, but they are pretty good. I prefer the second disk, which has more of a 'techy' darker sound to it, although the first track on the first disk is an awesome track to be sure.I still havent found any trance to rival that of James Holden - Balance 005 though, and reccomend that to trance fans that want something better quality than most of the stuff coming out."
3,"Disappointing, Monotonous, Every Song Sounds Identical.","Always looking for more trance, Chill, Dance, Techno, etc... I bought this CD based on many glowing reviews... As an Armin Van Burren fan, I think I'm being kind giving this 3 stars. A few of us were listening to this in the SUV (Dual 15' subs, Dynaudio, etc..) as well as at home with a great setup... but we laughed, and kept laughing every time we skipped to the next song, it sounded identical to the previous song. This 2 set CD is actually one giant long track, and nothing new or interesting here... I probably should give this CD set at least 2 stars. I love good trance, but it is the most monotonous set I have ever heard in my life... I don't recommend this CD set."
5,Great,"Awesome sound, great system with good quality at a great price, i got it last week and it works great, im very happy with this, its worth the money"
1,You'll regret it,"The Bose Wave radio/cd is a total P.O.S. I won't translate that for you. The CD player has a high failure rate. I get disc error messages all the time and it often fails to advance from one track to the next. The same thing happened on another unit that I bought for a family member. Hers is under warranty. Mine is 2 years old and Bose wants $100+ to repair it. This is after paying $499. Then, there's the radio reception or lack thereof. Most stations are plagued by static even though they sound fine on my car radio. Something positive? When music does play properly it sounds good. Unfortunately, with all the problems, mine is just collecting dust. Rarely have I been as disappointed in an expensive product as I am with this radio."
2,overpriced merchandise,"Although I liked the Bose CD unit, I really felt that the sound was a slight step up from other music units; If I am going to pay top dollar for a cd player, it better give me than it does; this unit would be better value for 200.00 less; it really isn't that spectacular for this money; sorry to say; I am such a music person and I thought that I would give it a try, very little audio difference to make up for the overpriced ticket on this unit. Remote is small and cheap , little better than a credit card in feel."
1,Not again,"First I purchased a rebuilt Bose with the add-on CD unit. It worked very good for a few weeks till I decided to leave it on (for background music for my cats) while going to the next town. After about 3 hours on my return it could not be controlled with any of the 2 remotes. Sent it in for repair. With some delay Bose sent me a new one. Now about 1 year later the New unit is just a digital clock. It will not work with any of the now three remotes and without an on/off switch this second unit is use less.I'm not sure if I'll send it in for repair( is this going to be a yearly repair) or cut my losses and buy something else.I suggest before buying these Bose Wave units you look very hard for something else, besides the sound is really NOT that great."
2,Not worth the money,"I've had my Bose for about 3 years. The sound does not live up to the hype. There is no way to adjust bass and treble--you get what you get, period. I like to choose specific songs on CDs to play and after doing this several times, the unit just decides it won't play that song anymore. This has happened on at least 5 CDs. Luckily, the CDs weren't damaged but for some reason the unit just skips these songs now or plays them with distortions. Bose said to send it back and for $99 they'd take a look at it---didn't say anything about actually fixing it, though. Too much trouble and after reading what has happened to others who did so, this just isn't an option. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT GET A BOSE!!! I'm a singer and I am very sensitive to sound and I can tell you the sound on this is not any better than on a boombox, in my opinion, and you cannot adjust it."
1,Not good quality,I ordered this to put on my AR 15. The quality was so that on it I returned it I wouldn't even put this on an airsoft rifle. My advice is to put a little bit extra money out and get something that's a little bit higher quality of an optic.
1,Does not fit!,"I just recived this in the mail, went to put on my A5 which it says it is for and it does not fit on my rail the screws that go through will not let it sit on the rail low enough to grip on to the rail! It seems like good item if it was able to on my gun!"
2,"Great, when it works","The instructions for this product explain that if you haven't established a network connection between the wall outlet units after plugging both of them in, ""try pulling [one of them] out of the outlet and plugging it right back in."" This is good advice, because you'll be crawling under your desk to do this 2-5 times every time your computer wakes up from sleep or reboots to reestablish your ""always on"" broadband connection. I'm sure some people might be lucky enough to have success with this device, but that's of little consolation to me. $100 or thereabouts is too much to spend on a product that ""sort of"" works. I'm sending it back."
1,Not working,"Have had this item for several months, used it several times, and now it has quit working. Could never get the encryption software to work right either.Made several calls to Netgear and finally am able to return it as faulty and they will replace...hopefully, the next units will work better."
5,"Journal of Economic Literature , Vol. XLII (June 2004)","Clark, Craig, and Wilson have produced a comprehensive book that serves a wide audience. While providing a detailed history of the development of public sector pensions from colinial times to 1920, tghe authors have taught their readers about the economic theory of pensions, informed them about the origins of the modern welfare state, and guided them to better understand the policy implications of recent proposals to reform Social Security. In the end, this book accomplishes much.Shawn KantorUniversity of California, Merced, and National Bureau of Economic Research"
3,the circle broke,"First one broke after light usage. Got another, haven't used it yet, hope it fares better. Size was OK, worked OK, but broke after about 12-14 uses. (first one.)"
3,Entertaining,"Includes several clips of popular game shows, showing funny moments of bloopers, outrageous challenges and incredibly dumb answers. Hosted by Ben Stein."
1,Not at all what I expected!,"There is no way the item I received had an original value of $300. The REAL set has a rope edge around the comforter and the pillow shams and the bedskirt has stripes. What I received is the same as pictured on the website (no rope edge - the bedskirt was not pictured) but the picture that came with the actual package had roping and a striped bedskirt! Although what I received is woven, it could be used on a warm summer night (it is rather thin)!You can't get much for $14.99 these days, so although disappointed in the quality of what I received, I guess I did get what I paid for but please... don't try to say it had an original value of $300!!"
4,Sink and Range Hood,"I used this product on my rather greasy range hood. It worked marvelously - better than the straight ammonia I used to use. The hood seems to repel grease build-up now. I also used it on my black kitchen sink that had become quite dull. It now shines and also seems to repel grime. It did not scratch the sink which was my fear. It worked well on some metals, but not on copper. I found a formula copper cleaner works much better."
1,somewhat ok,"used by flitz and maaas and would prefer flitz for serious minded polished max time between polishing. maas i tried several times and found that for fine jewelry it is ok, but for my harley chrome on flitz would do."
5,Better than Flitz,"I've used Flitz metal polish for years, but switched to Maas. It works great and leaves a little more tarnish protection on the metal.Comparing two identical items (Brass) that I polished with each brand. The Maas looks good nearly twice as long as Flitz."
5,Simply outstanding,"This documentary captures Brian Wilson as he is today -- mature, brilliant, still disturbed but clearly holding it together and still making music. Brian comes across as human and vulnerable, a modest man who quite literally changed the world. The unabashadly glowing tributes afforded him by such rock luminaries as David Crosby, Graham Nash, Tom Petty, Linda Rondstadt and others demonstrate the high regard Brian is held in by people who understand rock and roll music and its impact on our culture. These folks know the score and they're here to tell you that Brian Wilson is the man.Any Brian Wilson or Beach Boys fan should enjoy this wonderful film. More to the point, anybody who thinks Brian Wilson or The Beach Boys are lightweight or irrelevant should invest a couple of hours watching this film. It is simply outstanding."
5,"superb, anti-romance ""romance""","""Perfect Strangers"" is indeed a ""audacious, brilliantly visualized and slightly unnerving"" film that breaks all the rules of the stereotypical ""boy meets girl"" (in this case, man meets woman) genre. It cuts from scene to scene, never becoming typically sappy or sentimental, but moves ever closer to depicting the very heart of what makes a relationship tick: jealousy, obsession, fear, resentment, compassion, even love. The lovers are, at one glance, handsome/attractive/sexy/alluring, and at another, completely ordinary and ugly, and yet (or because of these contrasts) the viewer is drawn into their edgy world, wanting to know ever more about each of them. Great music underscores the plot development; beautifully filmed. Makes you want to go to New Zealand and live forever."
4,Oddly Interesting,"Bored on a Friday night, I pulled this from the shelf noting Sam Neil on the cover. In reading the little blurb on the back, I was further intrigued. It's hard to explain it, but it reminded me of The Secretary (Spade). There is this consuming and compelling idea that takes the viewer at first so slowly you don't notice it until it is clutching you tightly, and you are grasping in return. You almost envy Melanie's situation in a very strange way."
3,very funny but short,"A lot of funny parts were cut for some reason, but still a great show. I have the entire Sinbad collection."
5,Princeton Auroa Headlamp,"This is a GREAT headlamp. I have used this on my last 5 multi-day hikes and this headlamp has been there with me the whole time. I have never changed the batteries, and it gets a lot of use and abuse. The LED's are super bright and I use it on it's lowest setting. The highest setting blinds everyone around you. Great product, will never use another headlamp."
3,Not as good as the original,"If you're already a fan of Dream Park, this is a decent read. Don't expect it to be as good as the original, but it's worth the cost for a light, entertaining read."
4,Excellent,"I strongly recommend this book for every investor. It covers all the major market timing techniques and does a great job in explaining them. The book is comprehensive, well organized, and well explained. There is only one chapter that I really hated --chapter 16 which talks about the relation between trends in woman beauty and the market. This chapter should just be removed from the book; luckily it is only 10 pages long!"
3,live and rare!,"Quiet Riot's Live and Rare Volume 1 is full of good music, live stuff from the Condition Critical tour as well as three demos. The sound quality of the live material leaves a lot to be desired, like another reviewer stated it sounds about like a bootleg. The three demos are of good sound quality. If you're looking for some live Quiet Riot go with the Extended Versions cd."
2,COME ON FEEL THE DISSAPOINTMENT,"I'm not really a kid, I just use the kid review so I don't have to get an Amazon account. Anyway, this CD sucks. I bought it with a giftcard so wasn't as mad as I would have been if it had been with my own hard-earned cash. These live songs are terrible. Its sounds like the original recordings just with shortened notes and lots of extra ambient cheeing. I think it was recorded at one of the nudist colonies that Quiet Riot likes to play at becasue on Let's Get Crazy, Kevin DuBrow starts chanting about taking all your clothes off. Also, the bonus tracks are terrible. The only bonus track that I've listened to more than once is Thunderbird, and theres a much better version on Mental Health. People, these unlreleased tracks are unreleased for a reason. So if you're smart, stick with Mental Health."
4,It's ok. At least I now have an idea who is who..,"I hear the names often enough ..socrates, plato, aristotle, etc. I had no idea who came first, and could not correctly credit the philosophy to the right name. Now I can. Does not go into depth on any of them but gives a nice timeline and explains the main contributions of each. It's a good start. They cover a lot of philosophers, most of whom I'd never heard of. I feel smarter already."
2,I don't understand why it's always recommended.,"There are so many better books out there. My toddler does in enjoy it, but I cringe when she asks me to read it. It's complete nonsensical (storyline and language) and I don't think it benefits a toddler's development. I don't care for the illustrations either. books i do like to read with my toddler: mini masters collection, most Eric Carle, Elusive Moose, Hush! A Thai lullaby, and most other books that ""promote"" language development and are well-illustrated."
2,"Cute, but not popular","This book is cute and I like the illustrations, but my 2-year old son is not impressed with it. He loves story time and will sit and listen to book after book, but always drops interest in this one after page 2. There isn't an interesting story--just lots of rhyming. It's one of those books I want to like, but can't yet. We're expecting #2, perhaps this child will feel differently."
5,An off button for his crying.,"The drawings in this book are so big and colorful. They are perfect for infants.My son is 7 months old, and this has been his favorite book since he was 1 month old. At 1 month old, he was just beginning to look around his world, and the drawings in this book captivated him. He would get more and more excited as we read, and start squealing in delight by the time we got to the last few pages. These days, simply holding up the book for him to see is enough to stop his crying. No other book gets this reaction from him."
5,My son and my favorite book,"I bought this book when my son was 11 months old. The cadence of the whole book is wonderful. I've read it slow and I've read it so fast I can't keep up with myself turning the pages. It was quickly a favorite of mine, and when my son was old enough he would get this book from his 'library' and hand it to me. Even now (he's 8) we love this book. He reads it to me. And I love to ask ""faster, faster"" like he would do when I was reading to him. This spring we planted a strawberry pyramid and 3 blueberry bushes. It was funny that I didn't think of this book when my son said he wanted to plant these. But it makes perfect sense now. This will be a book that is handed down to his children and bought for his nieces and nephews I'm sure. The board book format is so excellent, the book is still in fabulous shape."
5,Razzamatazzberry!!,"Of the countless board books that we received when our son was born, none has pleased him (or us!) more than ""Jamberry!"" My four and a half month old giggles and squeals with delight each and every time we read it to him (which is quite often!) The rhyming is fun and whimsical (silliness at its best) and has a terrific sing-song quality to it (""Quickberry/Quackberry/Pick me a blackberry!"") I had never heard of this book prior to my son's birth, but now I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun way to introduce books and reading to their kids."
1,Cute. But that's it.,"This thing is unusual. That's why I bought it. But you don't have to make that mistake. Trouble with it is it WILL NOT STAY STILL!!! There's nothing on its bottom side except slick surface that will ensure that the mouse pad moves every time you move your mouse. Oh, it also sticks to your hand. Bad mouse pad."
4,cute shoes,"These are really cute and my daughter loves them, but they run pretty big. They also light up, which is cute."
2,Two of four arrived broken,"I ordered four of these for gifts and two of them arrived not functioning. They are quite pretty and the indiglo is very nice of course, but it seems Timex is not what it used to be. Thank goodness Amazon is so responsive. They have offered to pay for return shipping and refund. Gotta love them, if not Timex. When I contacted Timex THEY want me to pay for return -- can you imagine? I was just informing them of the quality of their product that appears to have degenerated over the years. They were very unhelpful, unlike Amazon. I always buy through Amazon for this reason."
2,I need more parts!,"I ordered this watch because I wear a watch only occasionally, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. The problem I am having with it is that it is not big enough to fit around my wrist. The directions tell you how to remove links if the watch is too large, but don't provide an extra link in case it is too small! I don't believe the size of the bracelet part of the watch was mentioned in the description, so I was quite disappointed that it did not include an extra link or two for those of us who do not have ""dainty"" wrists! Is there any way to get an extra link or two? I am carrying the watch in my purse now, but I would like to be able to wear it once in a while. Thanks very much for your assistance; I am unable to take it to a retailer for extra links, because I didn't buy it at one. I really think one extra link would do the trick, but would prefer receiving two just in case I need them! Sincerely, a normally satisfied Amazon customer, Margaret Titus."
1,RECORD? NOT! BARGAIN? NOT!,"I HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO RECORD ON THIS MACHINE. I FINALLY GAVE UP AND WAS JUST USING IT TO PLAY DVDS AND VCR TAPES. WELL GUESS WHAT, I USED IT ON 09/14/09 WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT ON 09/16/09 WHEN I TRIED TO USE IT AGAIN IT WAS 'DEAD IN THE WATER'. FOR NO APPARENT REASON THAT I CAN SEE THERE IS NO POWER TO THE UNIT. THE DISPLAY IS DEAD AND IT WILL NOT TURN ON. THE POWER CORD DOES NOT HAVE ANY BREAKS IN IT AND I HAVE TRIED PLUGGING IT INTO ANOTHER OUTLET. I HAVE NOT MOVED IT OUT OR AROUND IN MY CABINET SINCE I SET IT UP 2 YEARS AGO. I CHECKED THE PLUG AND OUTLET TO SEE IF MAYBE THERE WERE MARKS FROM WHERE IT MIGHT HAVE SHORT-CIRCUITED. IT LOOKS THE SAME AS ALWAYS. GUESS IT'S WHAT I GET FOR BUYING SOMETHING OFF OF WAL-MARTS CLEARANCE ISLE, EVEN THOUGH I PAYED $132.00 FOR IT. IT FEELS LIKE A RIP-OFF ESPECIALLY SINCE I ALREADY HAD A DVD AND SEPERATE VCR PLAYER. I ONLY BOUGHT IT TO RECORD."
3,Too Small,"This bag is a good choice if you are not planning on putting a lot in it. It is petite but seems to be study. I bought this bag for my boyfriend who carries a lot of ""extra"" things around with him (Magazines, PSP, phone, Ipod etc.) Needless to say he needs more room than 12 in. I have no idea what I was thinking. I am currently waiting on a return approval from Cutie Beauty Inc. but I would recommend this product to a friend along with the knowledge of how small the bag actually is.Western Pack Pony Series 12"" Mini Duffel Bag (Navy)"
3,Okay for the price,I didn't expect much but was surprised that this was actually pretty nice for the price. The fertility cross is made out of pretty sturdy silver and has a blue bead in the middle. It came on a black necklace with sizable options. Not really something I wear for fashion - but more for the meaning.
5,A Family Favorite,My older son loved this book and now it has become the favorite of my younger son who is now 3. We have it memorized because for awhile there we were reading it every night. It is sweet. It is imaginative. It is all boy! It's wonderful!
5,My 3 Year Old Loves It!,"This book is great for your little truck lover. It's perfect for my sons short attention span. Great pictures and concise wording. The boy in the book dreams of buying his own digger some day and even takes his little brother along for a ride, in our case I substitute sister. Highly recommend."
4,Right on The Money,Mr. Robinson's book is right on the money in making the case for The Debt....What America Owes To Blacks. He coverage of the what slavery and its aftermath have done and is still doing to African Americans is very true. His book is an excellent starting point for anyone desiring to learn more about reparations and what the term means to Randall Robinson. This book should be read by all Americans who sincerely would like to resolve the nation's racial difficulties.
4,An Antidote to our Shared Denial,"I have benefitted materially and personally from slavery. My alma mater, Brown University, is built on an original endowment from the Brown family of Rhode Island-- money earned in the transatlantic slave trade. So Robinson's argument is no big stretch for me.That Robinson's small, personal book should garner the sort of bile and violence visible here in other reviews is telling. Many white people feel personally attacked by even the idea of slavery reparations. Why is this? It's in the interest of all Americans to openly admit to the crime of slavery and move on as one country.Robinson's book sometimes wanders, and is sometimes too personally focused. But his basic point-- that America needs to own up to its shameful, long-term dependency on slave labor-- is powerful and should be obvious. The fact that it isn't obvious to mainstream America (there isn't even a national slavery museum or monument) is a painful symptom of our shared denial."
3,Missing pieces... go figure,"I would have figured that in this day in age that I would not be missing pieces on such an expensive Lego set. Not only that, but it is a pain in the rear to put together. It is designed beautifully but difficult to put together. If you are thinking of getting this, I would recommend using super glue to keep the pieces from falling off while building it."
1,Who the ?!@* Would Buy This,"LEGO, you're out of control with your costs.. way to make a product that only .01% of the population on this planet could ever afford"
5,YIPEE,"Fianally a book that does justice to the long running King Kong. People complain that it does not connect with the movie ""Son of kong"". Well guess what, that movie sucks. That's why they made a new book to make a new, bettter ending to King Kong's saga. The artwork is stunning, and Skull Island's origins are also revealed, which I liked. If you loved the old, classic King Kong, BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,An amazing and easy way to experience Sushi and Sashimi,"My experience with Ken's Sushi Video was great !!!It is a very simple way to see and learn the bases of Sushi, Sashimi and Maki (rolls).Amazing way to bring something new home, and discover the wonderful taste of Salmon, Tuna and even create your own variations of those dishes.It is very complete for a first version, and once you view, listen and learn the basic stuff you need to accomplish many exotic dishes, you will amaze your guests in the safety of your home."
5,Should check these guys out!,"Great Demo, the new cd, the Poison is even better. The only thing that I wish was different with the new cd, is that I wish four of the thirteen weren't from this demo, but no one is perfect. Other then that Bullet for my valentine is a great group, none of their songs sounds a like so their cd never gets boring at anytime. I do believe that this is the year for Bullet for my valentine."
1,Yawn,"This is a dreary, pedantic and repetitious bore. The author repeats his theme in every chapter about 10 times. The pictures are not that interesting and not very good quality."
5,A must read!,"This is a well-chosen collection of delightful writings, mostly written by scientists. In this book, one can learn the thought processes of great minds such as Feynman, Planck, Hardy, Turing, etc., in their own words. This reasonably-priced book will serve as a source of inspiration and ideas to an intelligent reader."
2,A JOKE,"To call this Essential must be a BAD joke. All of this is is just ballads and slow blues numbers. While I like them, there's still nothing essential about a record that misses out Gary's faster and harder songs. If it was called essential ballads, it would pass. But still, if you're looking for Gary's mellower side, there's better compilation to choose- Ballads & Blues 1982 -1994, which is nearly the same price, the same tracklist and has the original Parisian walkways on it (if the tracklist is correct).Anyway, avoid this one. Just 1 and 1/2 stars."
2,Low Budget modern day blaxplotation,"Allen Payne is a good actor in my opinion but he should avoid poorly directed/scripted films such as this. I enjoy seeing Elise Neal in anything because she also is a fine actor and very easy on the eyes to boot. Her character did represent some semblance of logic in this disorganized film. I guess any work beats no work at all. I bought the DVD so I earned the right to be critical, two thumbs down from me. Are films about Playas and Hustlers, pimps and Ho's all we want?"
3,Good but could've been better,"The movie was good, however the additional characters with the cook and MC Lytes and the cousin should have not been in this film as they took away from the movie. Elise Neal is such a great actress and Allen Payne acting was surprising not good as he is a good actor also."
1,"AGREE - Way smaller than I thought, and smaller than advertised.","This is 10"" wide and 17"" long, at best. Not the 11""x19"" advertised. I suppose you could stretch it and reach the advertised measurements, but either way it's misleading or dishonest. I'll be returning it."
4,Mid Life Crisis Comedy or Comedic Prophecy ?,"At the time the film was made it was simply a truly funny film about male mid life crisis. Bo started a craze with both men and women with her cornrow hairstyle and perfect body and Moore became everyman. What's most telling to me about the film isn't so much what it had to say about the time in which it was filmed, but rather, how much truth the film still reveals today. It's been twenty years since it's release and western men and women are still obssessed with youth, beauty and physical perfection, as if possessing these traits either ourselves or in our mates, we will somehow possess the key that unlocks the door to sexual, spiritual, and emotional bliss. Moore's character learned his lesson...too bad society as a whole is still stumbling down the beach in pursuit of a fantasy ""10"" that never exsisted in the first place."
3,today in making,This work is a good illustration to a way stories of infidelity in 70s last century made to date for a public screening.Rich daddy seduces one's wife to prove his earthy worth with copulating abilities.Of not so much interest to a modern viewer this awarded opus is.
2,Hi Fi Sound on Centre Speaker only?? Cmon Warner!,"I couldn't believe it, but this DVD although it says Dolby Digital on the box does not even come in stereo! Imagine...a DVD with sound only out of the centre speaker. Don't buy. Great classic movie, but stereo was out way before this movie was make. This DVD is a rip off, sound wise."
3,Blast from the past,"This movie brings back memories, but was not as good as I remember it. It has some very funny parts, some skin, but some lame parts. Rent it if you can"
3,Some parts are good; some terrible,"I am a Systems Engineer trying to understand things like how to analyze traffic coming into a server and using this analysis to drive some design issues, such as deciding on the hardware and software components (what to buy, architecture issues, security, issues of scaling etc.) Parts of this book discuss those issues (Ch. 3, 4 and 6, if Databases are involved).However, since this is a book written by committee, some parts are good while others are plain bad. In particular Chapters 5 and 6 (written by John Sudds) are plainly unreadable and not worth wasting your time over. The first four Chapters and the Chapter on Security are worth reading.The book is informational. If you want a desktop reference as you develope web pages etc., find some other book.I haven't used the Toolkit as yet. We are in the process of creating a test setup and hopefully the toolkit will come handy."
2,this woman sounds off,"""A Reader from Atlanta"" and Beth Ann Fennelly both need to educate themselves. I frankly couldn't agree more with Mr. Ward. I am absolutely sick of the kind of poetry like Fennelly's that gets attention for being risque and revealing. What a joke!! Keep your poems about mama and baby birds to yourself."
5,Condemned without judgment,"This book made me cry, how is it possible to survive does losses the pain the hunger and then not be hostile but teaching students never to hate.Mr Linder must be a very special man.I never will forget this book.Thank you for your sharing your pain with us.JW"
4,Ghana's a great country,My co-worker's brother wrote this book so I decided to support him and read it. Since I'm preparing for a trip to Ghana also I thought this book was interesting and Mr. Gaines' adventures were hilarious.
5,A Great Mystery,"First of all, I read this book b/c someone in my bookclub was sponsoring this book for the month. Also, this was my first mystery book and I have to say that this was a good mystery. I did not know that a mystery could keep my interest. I felt that the first two chapters were slow and then the book picked up the pace and I could not put it down. The characters in this book were funny to me but I could imagine them in my head when he first described them in the book. If you are looking for a good mystery then pick up this one."
5,BRILLIANT AND IMAGINATIVE!,"Tony Lindsay has written an imaginative and exciting book that will satisfy both male and female readers. The vivid suspense he offers will hold the attention of the avid and novice reader. There is just so much of what's going on in the real world swimming around in One Dead Preacher that one has to ask if it was taken from the headlines. Still, it's well worth the journey it takes you on. I absolutely loved it."
2,Missed the mark,"I was hoping to see more about the history of the kings and historical sites. Instead it seemed like it was more about ""mediums"" and speculations. It wasn't bad - but just wasn't what I had hoped for."
5,Great Quality,"After having three Western Digital Passports fail on me, I tried this Lacie drive.I've had it for a year, and it still works great. It comes with a power sharing cable to attach to a second USB port, but I've never needed to use it.It also contains a quality hard disk drive (mine is a Samsung disk)."

1,Misunderstanding...,"I agree about the writing and the story, but I do have to comment on the statement about the de-roboticizer. Don't you remember from the Sat-AM series that the power ring WAS what gave Uncle Chuck his memory back?"
3,"""networking video,voice and data transmission""","how does this networking video, data and voice takes place? how is the compression done if at all is there any?"
3,Defective On Arrival,"I love my iPod, but the one that Amazon shipped me had defective software on it. Luckily, the people at the Apple store were nice enough to let me exchange it for a new one within 24 hours."
1,The worst book I have ever read,Even though I have only read one book in my entire life. So it was also the best book I have ever read.
5,R.L. Stine does it again!!,"The book Truth or Dare by R.L. Stine is a very exiting book. It is about when a couple of friends go skiing for the weekend. They stay at a little-known friend's shalet for the weekend.There is a storm out-side,and they can't ski, so they decide to play a game of Truth or Dare. A deep secret accidently slips out, but no one acknowledges it. The next morning, a the girl who ownes the cabin is killed. Who did it? Another person is missing, and the jeep, the only car is stolen. Is there a killer on the loose, or is the killer really with them all along? This story has a very twisted end, and it is very suspenseful! I reccomend you read this book."
4,lucid explanation of complex biologial processesDr,"Dr Kandle's book combines a fascinating autobiography of a Nobel laureate with a remarkably clear text with excellent illustrations of biological processes responsible for the short- and long-term memory.I am an M.D. in a different specialty,but was impressed by the method of conveying scientific information to a non-specialist or a laypersonBorys Surawicz,M.D."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is a terrible book and the author does not cover any of the topics sufficiently. The homework problems are too hard compared to the examples that he gives. The exercises that he posts the solutions for are the ones that are much easier than the rest, which leaves you with questions for the harder problems."
1,I despise this book,"I've had this book for two semesters of a discrete mathematics course. The author is particularly fond of the word 'obviously'. The book includes a lot of proofs, but very poor explanation of how the author arrived at them. Every person I've ever met who used this book has absolutely hated it."
1,Poor home work solutions,"Most texts include either the even or odd solutions to the homework problems. But not this one, it is just random. The problem is that there are not enough solutions so that if you are having problems in one area, doing more problems doesn't help you since you can't check your work. This author was either just lazy or could affort to meet the standard of other texts.Can't wait for Cramster to post their solutions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,mixed quality,"some parts of it is good, but there are lots of confusing places; some proofs and explaination took me like an hour to figure out - that's an hour for like 1 paragraph of stuff; these bogged down moments doesn't start at the end - it starts right at the beginning - My most memorable bog down locations are the section on equivalent relations, the set theory proof that C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k) + C(n - 1, k - 1), the one about the number of ways to move from one corner of a square grid to the other corner while staying under the diagonal; the recursive solution to that same problem; the one about solving the inhomogenous recurrent relations (and I am just on chapter 5 out of 11 by the way - we skipped many sections in class) - there are quite a few minor bottlenecks as well; I know the author didn't exactly use the best wording because I rewrite my notes and I think I used better wordings"
3,"Gets the job done, but not what i expected","I bought this a little into the school year so I already had a new copy of the book, which I returned when this arrived. It arrived earlier than the estimated date I originally received (thankfully). But it was taped up with clear and black tape. The book wasn't falling apart but parts of it were hidden, at first I feared it was the wrong edition. But that was not the issue, I'm not sure what the issue really is. When I lifted up some of the book it seems the book might be a donation, or meant to become a donation after use.And whoever originally sought to sell this donated book was trying to hide it. The book is exactly the same, content-wise, to that of my classmates. But I don't think I'm going to be able to sell it in person given the circumstances."
2,Inconsistent throughout,"I'm taking this class from the author of the book and he teaches like the book reads. If you are already experienced in discrete math then you will be okay. If not, you will have a tough time. The author begins with the simplest of examples and then jumps into very difficult ones without much in between. The steps from easy to hard are not explained well and one feels a bit lost (at least I do). The mathematical explanations are not helpful as they are just as confusing as what they are trying to explain. All in all I'd pass this one by if I had the choice, unfortunately I have to read it for my class."
1,No Good,"This book is horrible. He doesnt define the words that a bolded either. Most of the time he uses the proofs themselves to define a word. That doesnt help anything especially when the proofs are confusing too. It seems like when he explains something, he is really saying the same thing over and over again. It is impossible to understand this book."
1,One of the worst films ever made,Am I watching the same movie like everyone else? The movie I saw was unwatchable and stupid. It right up there with Plan 9 From Outer Space on my worst movies of all-time list.
3,Lots of Power-Worked for a While then Quit,"I just ordered a second Power G for my layout which has 2 tracks and trains. This unit has a lot of power and will run several G scale Diesels on one track only. Unit is heavy and well made but my first one just quit working, it is 8 months old with light usage. I boxed it up and sent back to MRC to repair,$9.00 check to them for handling and shipping. We will see how long the second one works.These units have the best power for the Buck to run Large Scale 2 motor Diesels as the 1 amp starter set power packs will not run the large scale heavy Diesels."
2,Do not buy!,I bought this camera four months ago. This company is not making this product and will not give you any help.The quality is poor and if you upgrade to windows 2000 or XP forget using it at all.What another poor buy.
5,Gripping and Unrelenting,"A sad and moving tale that showcases a lost American family--a depressed astronaut, his wonderfully gay son dying of AIDS and his former wife who opts for the vagabond life. Russell writes with a wonderful imagination and creativity. Good reading!"
4,What a suprise!,"I have read all the reviews and must say I agree with most of them. I happened across this cd at a listening station and I was immediately taken with it. I put it in my car and I don't think I took it out for quite some time. Even my 16 year old son likes parts of it(he's into 311-POPA ROACH-etc.). There are some really good songs on this cd and they don""t all sound alike. I personally really like ""Let It Ride"". I believe if you buy this cd you will be glad you did."
1,Corny and unbelievable,"This is the final VC Andrews book I'll ever buy. I am giving up on VCA. The recent series (beginning with the Logans) no longer hold that magic I used to experience when reading her books. The ghostwriter (Andrew Neiderman, horror writer) is a lousy author. The stories are too modern, melodramatic and pretty lame. I am sick and tired of reading about a high school girl and her lame high school problems. This was a very disappointing series. There were no secrets left to discover after reading this. Plus, the ghostwriter gets his time frame for the novels in this series screwed up."
1,Clamps are not good,"I build guitars and already had several of this style clamp. The ones I own work great. These clamps are not good. The adjustments are sloppy and do not keep the jaws in line and the cams are not made correctly - they tighten for about half of there throw and then start reducing instead of increasing the presure. The clamps from luthier supply companies are more expensive, but worth the money - these are a waste of money."
2,"Great item ,if you ever receive it!","I ordered the 4 1/2"" & 7 1/2""cam Clamps from RIGHT-[...]I received the 4 1/2"" with in one week. It's been almost two months and I have not recived the 7 1/2"" clamps. I received a email stating they were back ordered and would be shipped in 4 to 6 weeks from order date. I have made numerous attempts to speak to someone via email or phone to check the status of my order and get no reponse. The price is great but what does it matter if you don't get the product or at least an explanation."
3,IPng Internet Protocol Next Generation,"Well this book, is easy to understand and is in a narrative story style telling in detail about the commitees and the people interacting to make IPv6 possible. However as it is for any amaeture and layman it might not quench the thirst of people who are really into networking and wanted specific answers and material. Thats where this book losses out. Other wise it is a good and very informative book."
2,Tendentious at best,"Judson is an academic manque who wrote an interesting if overly pretentious and self-agrandizing history of molecular biology. Unfortunately this book, which, as Judson states early on, could not find a publisher, would have been better left unpublished. This desultory history of scientific fraud simply rehearses what has been better said elswhere. The standard fraud cases - from Newton to Pasteur to Freud to Darsee to Baltimore - are given a superficial treatment. Especially egregious is the hatchet job on Baltimore and Imanashi-Kari. Anyone wanting to find out how shoddy and partisan his treatment of the later affair is ought to read the thoughtful and well researched ""The Baltimore Case"" by Daniel Kevles. Since Judson seems to regard himself as a purveyor of scientific ethics in a time of lapsing moral values in the scientific enterprise, one can only hope that the scientific community can protect themselves from such scrutiny. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes."
2,Self timed Sprinkler review,"After a disasterous period of using the Nelson Dial a Rain self timed sprinklers, I looked at other brands to see if anything else was available. The Gilmour looked promising, so I bought two units. I have to say, I'm sorry I did. One of the two did not shut off initially, and then suddenly started working. The unit is rather difficult to direct. That is, keeping the spray pattern where you want it (& reduce water waste).The timer as well seems to be a bit 'off' and tends to water more that the dial indicates (ie. the 1 hour setting runs much more than one hour).I would suggest looking at the Nelson Triple Spray Occillating Sprinkler, instead of this unit."
1,Locked up two laptops.,"I wish I could report that the Syba USB/FireWire Combo cardbus adapter was a painless and trouble-free way to add extra USB ports to a laptop, but for me it was not. On both an older Compaq running 98SE and a later Dell running XP, the one I bought caused the systems to lock up, sometimes during the boot process, and sometimes during the automatic driver installation. It didn't work in either case. The reason for buying it was to get around the problem of a physically damaged USB jack on the Compaq's motherboard; when it failed to work with the Compaq, I tried the same card in my Dell just to see if it was the card or the computer that was at fault. When the Dell also failed to accept it, I concluded that this one was no good. It may have been a bad sample of an otherwise good product, but I think I'll trade for a different brand when I take it back to the store."
5,"Very detailed, easy to understand",The book has a wealth of knowledge on subjects ranging from very basic repairs to super-complicated. Very useful for anyone trying to take care of their favorite possession.
5,Zen-like as the title implies,"The key to this book is its attitude which can't be better. This is an all positive upbeat book full of valuable information - assuming you have interest in the topic.I believe that all people can do many fix it tasks if they approach these tasks with a cool, positive mindset. This book parallels my thoughts and if you follow along, you will also find that you can do anything on your bicycle right up to building your own custom starting from a frameset.When reading about this book, I was skeptical about the illustraions in lieu of photographs, but now that I've used the book, I think the author very wise to have taken this approach. A good illustrator can bring out subtle aspects of the topic which would be lost in the clutter of a photograph.The only folks who wouldn't benefit from this book are those who know enough already to write it. I can't recommend it highly enough for the rest of us."
2,Good cam but not for Windows 2000 or XP!,"Very pleased with the cam when used with Windows ME. Good in poor light and good resolution. Had some trouble in getting it to work at first and had to download new software from Kensington which solved the problem. Technical support good until I enquired about it working with Windows 2000 and XP. There is a ""hardware issue"" and the development of drivers for Windows 2000 and more importantly XP has been dropped. This means that this cam is very limited in it's upgrade ability. Having seen Windows XP and been impressed how good it is anybody thinking about buying a cam should bear this in mind."
4,Hagiography at its most entertaining!,"Just as Will Rogers never met a man he didn't like, W.C. Fields has not yet met a biographer who could faithfully reveal this extraordinary life. This book, the very first biography by a gifted writer and close crony and idolator of Fields, stands up as a very entertaining, fun read. No pretense is made of its veracity, and the author revels in passing along as truth the many legends, embellishments, half-truths, fictions, conceits, misdirections and heresies propagated and condoned by Fields himself during a lifetime of playing anyone but his true extremely complicated self to the outside world. His close friends, Taylor included, gleefully abetted this cover-up, and his book continues the conspiracy. With that ton of salt, it remains immensely entertaining and worthwhile reading!"
2,time will tell,"Bought one. Returned it because the floppy drive didn't work and the screen went on the fritz. Exchanged it for another one. Again the floppy drive doesn't work and the DVD-ROM drive won't open. I talked to Sony support and they claim they don't have hardware problems with the computer or its docking station (though they had in the past). Curious to know if others have had this problem too or if I am just spectacularly unlucky this year. I haven't yet decided whether or not to give Sony a third try on this machine. It's a pity since it seems like such a well designed laptop, if only it would work.Another reviewer mentioned Sony's support. I agree that it is weak, especially relative to Dell and others. My desktop Sony had to go back. It came back (reset so all information was gone). They hadn't fixed the hardware; they had just re-run the setup discs. Gee, thanks Sony!"
2,Keep Looking - CS is important!,"Well I have just about had it with Sony.First let me say that when you need support you are contributing to the outsourcing in the US.Second, unless it's a simple problem these people have no clue what they are doing.Third, you are put on hold forever!When they finally figure out that they can't fix your problem they transfer you back to the US, where someone there tells you that the people you just spoke to have no clue.The best you can expect at this point is to send the computer in for repair. Not a lot of fun,(three months new) because you are now without a computer for several weeks and all your data is at the hands of strangers.Customer Service has to be one of the most important factors when buying a computer, Sony gets an F.My next computer will be a Dell, providing they maintain the quality service in the US they have built their reputation on.Here's a new motto for Sony VaioIf you like getting the run-around, Sony is for you."
5,"Excellant Saga, better than Shogan","I read this book a long time ago, and would recomend it to anyone. It has everything, Action, Romance, History, and Depth. Wish it was more accesable!"
2,Kensington VideoCAM,"This webcam has to be one of the pickiest cameras in existance. Kensington's drivers are all-out horrid. It's NT compatibility is NIL. I'm not sure how it works on a MAC but its perfectly unstable on a PC, crashes my system alot, the VideoCAMWorks software only gets worse as Kensington comes out with new releases (one new version over the past year). If you're looking for a webcam whose maker will release decent patches to drivers, etc... you haven't found it. Performance is ugly too. I don't reccomend setting it up in low-light conditions."
1,A pure lemon,"Poor picture quality, lousy frame rate, mediocre software, and terrible in low light. These might be forgivable in an entry-level camera, but the showstopper is that the software doesn't work in anything newer than Windows 98 or Mac OS 9.x and Kensington has no plans to update it.If you're looking for a camera from a company that makes good products and actually supports them, Kensingon ain't your bag."
1,Johnny Cash Karaoke,"I can't really comment on the quality of this item because unfortunately I can't get it to work. I didn't realize that CD+G cds could only be played in a CD+G player, and that is not the type of karaoke machine I have."
5,Great Advice from One Right Brainer to the Rest of Us.,"Having had the fortune of learning from Lee in person, I can tell you that he is right on with all of his suggestions, in the world of the right brainers.His promotional tactics work.

1,Does not work . . . at all,I suppose I got a batch without the active ingredient. Even allowing for 20 minutes no beard was removed. NONE.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"the reviews were not up when i bought it and it claimed to be ""award winning."" i opened the lid and saw that the entire keyboard is a sticker. under the slider on the left is a sticker as well. my one year old could apply the stickers better. they have creases in them in some places and bubbles in other places. the case looks SUPER COOL allowing you to see the wiring of the laptop. but unfortunately, it's junk. do not bother."
3,Need to wait and see...,"I was looking for a product for indoor use of public speaking for elderly people who need not speak up taking the strain. I had tough time fitting the ""AA"" size batteries into the battery comparment. Out of 6 slots, only 2 of them take them easily. Rest of them, I couldn't even succeed forcing the batteries in, even with the risk of breaking the instrument. The customer support (Kaito Electronics), when called, says this is a known issue and did not offer any help other than saying that I should try hard(er) forcing the batteries in. I finally succeeded with one of the battery brand from India (which is where I gifted this product) and usage of bigger horse power to push them in. The instrument does what it says it does for now. If possible try to find higher quality products."
3,"Works fine, but it is a hassle","I bought this product to help me teach a kickboxing class at my college; however, the band that it came with is too big to fit snugly around my waist--even after tightening, even after having other people inspect it it just will not tighten enough--and I'm not even that tiny (waist size 30 inches). Yes, I can get it on, and if I am relatively sedentary I can get it to stay in place, but standing in place would defeat the purpose of teaching a gym class.All in all, the product works well, but you'll have to find another belt (I haven't yet) to hold it.JustinP.S. If you do buy this product, one of the reviews warned about a high-pitched screech: the best way to avoid that sound is to 1) make sure that the mic and the amplifier are more than a foot or 2 apart when the machine is on and 2) turn the volume up gradually, not in one big dial swing."
2,Not one of Cary Grants Best,"The film turned out to be tedious to watch. As a Cary Grant fan, was disappointed, specially since it was done with the lady he did marry in real life."
3,Basic Information,"I read this book very quickly, It didn't have a lot of groundbreaking ideas, but I was able to pick up a couple of tips. It was OK."
4,A Very Fun Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. This movie features infiltration to gather human intellegence. But the true star of this movie is (for the most part) the very realistic depictation of how the British SAS (Special Air Service) operate. The SAS is the UK's version of the USA's Delta Force. It should be remembered that SAS predates our Delta Force by a bunch of years, and that most objective observers would say that the SAS is the anti-terrorist force against which others are measured. As Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan said in ""Patriot Games"" ""SAS: When you care enough to send the very best."" The movie is a fictional account of SAS's operation against Iranian captors who took over the Iranian counsulate in Great Britain. A definite and enthusiastic ""thumbs up."""
2,BORED,I rented this movie from Hollywood Video. It was a struggle not to turn it off and watch the news. The movie was cheaply made and the acting is mediocre. It is insulting to our intelligence by trying to make us believe what is happening could be reality.They try hard to conceal the identity of the vigilante for most of the picture. The vigilante knows when and where anything bad is about to happen.Our detective hero finally catches up to the vigilante just after the vigilante wipes out a bad man. The detective having the drop on this killer and instead of revealing the identity of this super person says go away.There are many sequences just as unbelievable as this.
3,Do we all need heroes?,"The theme of this movie is not an easy one. Actors are influenced bythe story, scripting of the story, time of release, how it all touches their personal lives and movie budget, among other things. Do we need a perfect performance in a movie? I wonder whether so-called ""imperfect"" or ""flawed"" movies have themes which lie closer to actual life. I tend to leave room for this myself. I give this film 3 stars when comparing it with others. On it's own merit, I would rate it higher. In addition, it could have been one which the actors just used to list on their resumes. I really don't know. The title is ironic, as the actual ""gunman' turns out to be a woman. I list this film as a quiet one which doesn't shout a message. It's just there to attract those who will be touched by the message itself."
4,Good but.....,"Anthrax are the soundtrack to my childhood. Listening to Bush sing Belladona tracks is a little weird, but not bad. I love this, but I think I still prefer to get out the originals. Bush just can't hit those high notes required to pull off these great tracks. The Bush era has produced some off the greatest Anthrax albums of all time (Stomp 442 is THE Best Anthrax album of all time), but there was no real need for this bar novely factor.Go get the originals, bang your head and love life as a lucky old school metal fan.P.S. New Core and Nu metal is ultimately pretty boring, go get an education in what metal is supposed to be, Anthrax is an awesome place to start"
3,Only For The DieHards!!!,"John Bush steps in and puts his vocal stamp on some Belladonna/Turbin-era tunes that the fans voted on. All of the songs were recorded over a two-day period and it provides for a nice, raw sound.However, all of the songs are played in a VERY straight-forward fashion and no attempt was made to re-work them for Bush and his (amazing in its own right) voice.This is for the diehard fan only. It would have been very cool of the guys to at least attempt to bring the tunes into the millennium. Still, you can enjoy it for what it is."
1,Not as pictured in advertisement. **UPDATE**,"When I ordered this I thought I was going to receive what it advertised but I guess not.It arrived sooner than expected and that was a real plus.Now to talk about the actual item. Well here's the goods and the bads.GOOD- It comes with the double cord for gbc and gba sp, fits nice and tight maybe to tight? Ships out pretty quick.BAD- When me and my brother are battling on POKEMON lol after maybe say 2-3 minutes his says waiting and freezes there while I continue to battle I assume the computer. Not sure if it's defective or if it's something else. Another bad is that what I received was a cord in a baggy other than the cord in the box that is actually advertised.ALL in ALL if I find a way to fix the freezing in one of the players game it will actually be a decent cable. I give this 3 stars.UPDATE- It went from freezing to not working with under 4 attempts of trying to battle. so disappointed right now. Not sure what to do."
3,A different point of view...,"Nazis as seen by a french communist journalist, in 1932-34. His communist point of view illustrates the daily life of the young germans during those troubled years. Above all, he points out that the persecution of the communists by the nazis is a real problem compared to what was imposed to the jews... Worth reading for its sincerity."
3,"Good, Clean Fun","An enjoyable sequal to ""The Shunning."" Another fascinating glimpse into the world of the Amish and the grace of God."
3,Less interesting than The Shunning,"While The Shunning is an excellent book, its sequel is not. The plot is slow in some places, frustrating in others, and sometimes just a bit too unrealistic.In addition, some of the characters from the first book seem to have undergone a weird sort of change in personality, rendering them much less likeable than before (and this includes Katherine herself). And the new characters are just a little two-dimensional, though they're not too terrible.I really don't recommend this book, unless you're desparate to find out ""what happens next""."
2,Okay..............,"This book was decent. I hated how it kept jumping from scene to scene. It was dragged out. Mrs. Lewis took her time, and it ended up being boring and slow"
5,Great book,I enjoyed this book for the riveting story it possesses. It helps to know how the story goes. I happened to catch the movie before reading the book.
3,Confessions....Surprise me,"This book was an easy read. The Amish theme was interesting. It's a good, clean book. However, I found the book very basic. Suspense was lacking. Predictable."
1,NOT LEGIT!,"WARNING!..This ""Uncut Special Edition"" with the Gold trim is a BOOTLEG!Notice it doesn't say who the distributor is?CODE RED is working on a BETTER Print right now."
5,Should I buy this if I have the OOP 2-disc release?,"5 stars for the movie...it's a great ""bad"" b-movie from the 80's and is a lot of fun.Really though, the reason why I'm writing this review is to figure out what's different with this release from the out of print (OOP) 2-Disc special edition that currently goes for quite a bit of money here and on Ebay.Unfortunately, a lot of lesser known small-time genre films like this get horrible DVD treatments. Often times they may even just be a DVD-R marketed deceptively as an actual DVD release. Additionally, a lot of times you'll see the words ""Uncut"" and/or ""Uncensored"" which is simply not true. Other times, a film will be marketed as ""Uncut"" and/or ""Uncensored"" yet all it contains is an extra 30 seconds of dialogue or other pointless stuff that adds nothing to the film.So if anybody can answer me, what specifically is different between this version and the OOP version? Thanks in advance."
5,no more night sweating,"I really like this topper, since we have received I have no more night sweating . it is comfortable ,It is not as comfortable as a memory foam,but to wake up dry and to be able to sleep through the night means more to me. have recommended it to friends"
4,Can't wash it,"It should be noted in the description here, but you can't wash it or dry clean it. You can see this on the cuddleewe site under about/faq/#howtocareSo be sure to get the cover they sell for it. Cuddle Ewe(tm) Cotton Flannelette $30.95Other than that I have had one for many years and I love it!"
1,A female Nate Dogg:Who plays Violin,"Miri Ben-Ari is a Beautiful Chick. but Musically She is like a Female version of Nate Dogg.Lackluster Production&Arrangements that just make Her a Guest on her own Album.She has no real Pressence besides Her playing&even Her Instrument feels secondary on Her own album how does that work??I dug ""Sunshine"" with Her,Anthony Hamilton&Scarface,but even there She is playing 2nd fiddle on her own Song&Record.that is not what a Solo Career is made of."
4,Not so realistic but funny in its worth,"Alice, I think is a great book, although not so realistic. Some of the situations Alice gets herself into seem to be not based on reality one bit, unlike some other books which seem like the portrayel of an average teenager.Although some of this book is a bit silly, not at any point is it not entertaining or witty."
5,Fantastically funny!,I am an adult and I laughed so hard throughout the book and I loved the sequels too!
5,Adrian Mole's Canadian alter ego,"If you liked Adrian Mole you will love Alice. If you like to laugh you will like Alice. If you like to read you will like Alice. Anyone who doesn't is devoid of irony and the ability to laugh at oneself.This is a great book, for young and old adults alike. Small town life is captured and reflected warts and all. The love hate relationship between kids and their parents is something we all experience. And Alice is a great portrait of someone who is trying to grow up in a community full of wierdos, good guys, bad girls and her mother's frightening freinds.Read it, and laugh!"
4,I thought it was pretty good,"i can understand why all of you dislikers didn't like this book. True, it is very exaggerated and it dosn't portray teenage life accurately at all, but ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO!!!!! it is supposed to be a light, fun read for when you're feeling down so you can laugh at the world. Who cares if you can't relate to alice? who cares if it offends you? its supposed to be a funny fictional novel, not a documentary!"
3,"Good production, but lacking in lyrical originality","Like most 'southern' hip hop albums to come out the past few years, Crow's Nest is densely packed with tight production, yet lacking in subject matter. The probelm is that these fellas don't try to tackle more original subject such as great southern groups such Outkast or Goodie Mob, rather they tend to recycle the same themes that are redundantley used by everyone from Cash Money to No Limit. Still, Crow's Nest is filled with good beats, which does count for something. I only wish they could've done the beats justice with some more thought provoking lyrics."
3,Typical Modesitt and not his best,"I will not rehash the plot (a la Harriet Klausner) given you can read the editorial reviews for that.This book has some of the strengths and most of the flaws of Modesitt's other books. As always, the heroes are identical in all important respects to every other Modesitt hero, though this time there are two of them.I have found Modesitt best when he is writing coming-of-age stories (eg. the Cyador duology, White Order, Colors of Chaos) and this is not one of them.If you have not read its prequel Alector's Choice,I would definitely not recommend starting with this book, as I did. There are a number of invented unexplained terms which made it more difficult initially for me to follow the plot. The first 3 books in the series are set in the distant future, and are not required reading."
4,Good pump,This is a decent pump for the money. The dual air outlets come in handy. I would reccomend it !
3,Why all the hype?,I just finished reading this after it was recommended by so many friends and critics. I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the first 100 pages were extremely difficult to get through. The remainder of the book was only slightly better. I don't think I'll bother with Independence Day.
4,Favorite of Ford's,"This is my fav book by R Ford. Having spent many hours driving up & down the NJT and Garden State, perhaps I identified a bit too much with the protagonist. Great writing being the mind of oru narrator."
1,This Book Sucks,"This book sucks. [...] Ford has a formidable talent for using a lot of words to say little. I would have liked, at least, to learn a little bit about the world of sportswriting, and even in that I was disappointed."
2,A Non-Event,"I had read a comment by a newspaper correspondent that a Richard Ford book had changed his life. This caused me to readThe Sportswriter.After ploughing halfway through, I gave up, as nothing worthwhile had happened.I can't understand how his boring hero was so successful in picking up women for affairs. I won't be trying any more Richard Ford books."
4,Keep on trucking,"Frank Bascombe is a wholly lovable protagonist, who lives in a New Jersey suburb. He has lost one son, his marriage, and his dreams of being a major literary voice, but he's still okay, he reminds himself. He's a pretty good sportswriter; his ex-wife and surviving two children live nearby, where they all appear to have an amicable relationship; he belongs to a divorced men's group; and he still enjoys the company of women.The author's message, via Bascombe, is that it's okay to have tried to realize one's dreams, only to have fallen far from the mark. To still keep breathing and walking is, in itself, redemptive.Constance Richardson, Author, ""Swimming Upstream: A Memoir."""
5,Read it Again,"""The Sports Writer"" left quite an impression on me. I felt sick for weeks and thought it was untoppable until I read ""Independence Day."" I have read both of these books numerous times, and find them equally disheartening with each repeat. I have read all of Richard Ford's works. His short fiction is superb. I especially enjoyed the Parisian portion of ""Women with Men,"" although I prefer the shorter works in general. Richard Ford is an exceptionally concise writer. I cannot say enough how much I enjoy his work, including these two novels, which are my favorites."
1,Earhook brakes all the time and it cost too much to replace it.,"I have purchase 4 BT 125 because the conection is good. However, they all brake earhook in the same place to often. That makes the product useless since the company does not provide or sells the replacement hook. To me the product is defective since it brakes on the same place every time no matter who uses it. Furthermore, If you want to buy the replacement earhook the Jabra company does not have it and if you find it, cost almost the same as buying a new and complete BT 125. I want all to be aware of that fact. Is there anything that you can do to make the Jabra Company supply the earhooks?? They shoud be penalize for supplyng a defective product."
1,Defective Right Out of the Box!,"This was my first foray into the wireless headset world. I've always thought they look silly, but it seemed the safest way to talk and drive. Sadly, my Jabra was dead right out of the box.I sent an email to Jabra technical support for help. The good news is they replied within 4 hours. They bad news - their reply was ""I'm sorry to reply the headset is defective out of the box."" They are appropriately offering to replace the unit, however I have to ship it to them at my expense and wait for them to ship a new one back via UPS ground.I don't know if this is typical of Jabra, it's just my experience. We'll see how the return and replacement experience unfolds......"
1,Unusable,"I bought this cheap bluetooth since I do not typically use my phone much while driving.The good:* the voice quality is not bad* The call button is large and easy/soft to operateThe bad:* Does not fit or stay on the ear. The large ear hook is useless because the ear bud is at an improper distance from the pivot point of the ear hook. The device ends pointing straight up, but still does not stay put. This device is meant to fit only a select (few) number of people. I would not recommend you chance it."
2,Volume too low to hear in car,"It's price is good and the sound quality is quite good however it lacks sufficient volume control to hear a conversation while driving! It's quite light and can fall off your ear quite easily. The power-on, power-off button is awkward and tends to redial rather than power off! PASS!"
1,Stay Away,"Got two of these headsets because of high reviews.Used both headsets on PS3, had a lot of troubles getting it to work correctly and sync with the console.The audio seems a to have some static and the mic doesnt transfer you voice clearly.I bet there are better options. Maybe these arent the real Jabra headsets?"
4,Uncomfortable.,"If you plan to use this for extended amounts of time it can get very uncomfortable. It makes my husband and I's ear ache after a good time of playing COD4. Otherwise, it works really great and does the job."
4,Good functional headset.,"I bought this headset because I was extremely frustrated with another bluetooth headset(different company) I had bought a year ago. Compared to my previous headset, this BT125 is great! It is very light weight, it is also very comfortable, and it doesn't have a problem picking up my voice. I'd highly recommend this headset, it's also quite affordable :)"
4,Excellent Value,"This is an easy to use, quality product at a fantastic price. It is great for me because I am prone to lose such things.The product arrived in a plastic bag rather than factory packaging, so I wonder if it was really new as was advertised. I have not had any trouble with it."
5,It keeps their Sacrifice Alive,"I really like this book. There are several good books about the Alamo but this one by Jim Murphy is well written and has a true feel of endearment for those that sacrificed their lives and left loved ones behind. The cover is very striking and captivating and I immediately was drawn to the book. The layout of the book is exquisite. It really captures the historical meaning and importance of this event of heroism and bravery and enables you to imagine a feel for the time, place and people. This is a beautiful looking and splendidly written book."
2,"How to Debate, so to Speak","I unfortunately did not get as much out of this book. I was looking for an update to debate, after being out of it for over a decade, as I began a high-school class teaching Cross-X. There were some helpful tips in this book, but it gave more of an overview of debating and debates in general, rather than the nuts and bolts of high-school or even college debate. I'd recommend theThe Debater's Guideby Ericson instead."
4,"A little more garlic, please!","I have several of the Le Creuset casseroles because I love the way they look, and they keep food moist and tender. The lid on the garlic casserole does not have the typical handle on top; the handles are on the sides on both the top and bottom of the pot. This makes it a little more awkward when cooking, but otherwise it wouldn't look so much like a garlic! The pot is much more attractive than the picture is. The shape and soft white color make a nice contrast to the other pots, and this makes my whole collection look better. It is quite a conversation piece, and very useful, too."
2,primitive and boring,"This game might have been a real hoot 5 years ago, but after playing Battlefield 2 and Call of Duty, this game is going to the swap meet... in the $1.00 bin for sale. Don't waste your time."
2,Too hard to follow,"This book is rather bloated. There are too many references to standard specifications and not enough ""down to earth"" explainations. The beginning third of the book is a confusing overview of LAN and WAN technologys with a few errors and bloated with standards numbers and designations. After the first few chapters of the ATM ""meat"" part of the book I soon found myself in acronynm hell. Again bloated with useless standard desigations. I would recommend this book to anyone who is already well versed in ATM as a good reference book. However, if your new to the technology as I am, find something else."
1,"Cheap, painful and a waste of money","Hardly fits to your finger, and limited mobility makes it painful to wear.Do not buy."
4,Beautiful illustrations but factual errors,"Please be advised that though you may find the illustrations helpful and entertaining, some of descriptive pharmacology contains fatal errors. For example, on page 119:""Cocaine can induce seizures as well as fatal cardiac arrythmias. IV diazepam and propanolol may be required to control cocaine-induced seizures and cardiac arrythmias.""Propanolol is CONTRAINDICATED in cocaine-induced cardiac arrythmias because of coronary artery vasoconstriction. Responsible health-care providers need to know this."
3,"Adequate, but Long and with Errors","I am a third year medical student and purchased this book as a first year to study for board exams. This book has pretty pictures, but over-simplifies and does not contain all the information that is in the board exams. Also, I found several inaccuracies in the text. As boards approached, I purchased Katzung and Trevor's Clinical Pharmacology, which is excellent, with much better questions, and all the important details. Don't be discouraged by the length, it is a fast read and will prepare you very well for boards."
4,Pharmacology book,It is very good at making difficult concepts easy to understand. I strongly recommend it.
3,Very good book for a review,But not a very deep insight look at drugs. Very good for side effects and used it a lot for the anti-neoplastic part of pharmacology.
5,justice,I haven't read this book. I was reading the reviews to decide whether or not I should read it and saw that the previous reviewer decided to review it twice (giving it a single star twice) and decided in the interest of fairness to nullify that by adding a 5 star. I decided to check out this book because it was referenced by Jacques Barzun in his Dawn to Decadence history. And any book that generates the hostility witnessed in the previous review must be pretty good.
5,Romantic mystery with great twists!,"I don't want to give it all away. Basically, a doctor is calledin to authenticate a Native American ""death mask"" While she isattending the piece, she is assigned an agent to act as bodyguard. Their personalities are oil and water. But when serious murder attempt is tried against the doc, more than amystery starts to heat up.Swift moving story with sharp 3-D characters."
4,For Serious Apollo Aficionados...,"This is a great set of DVD's for those who would enjoy watching raw footage from the Apollo 11 mission. There are some long slow sections with little commentary, but these are frequently followed by intense moments during the launch, lunar landing and takeoff, and reentry. The scenes shot on the Moon really make you feel as though it's happening now, and while they run pretty long, the effect, if you stick it out, is almost surreal. It's as though you are right there with Armstrong and Aldrin, sharing in all the little, unnerving glitches that demonstrate that this was indeed a stunning human endeavor.I recommend this to anyone who appreciates the magnitude of this achievement and would like to relive it."
1,"Descent into obsession, story of a woman's depression","This is one of the worst books I have ever read. A poorly written basically stream of consciousness book, this novel takes you through the darkness of one woman's mind. It is meant to be an account of a spiritual teacher, but instead you are dragged through the woman's sexual fantasies, dark dreams, suicidal contemplations etc. If I were a psychiatrist getting paid $200 an hour, it may be worth sitting through all this sludge, but to pay good money just to hear her paranoid daydreams? No thanks."
1,A suspect narrative,"Don't be deceived. The publicity kit for this book admits that it is a novel! One has to question the mother who tries to destroy her son using a fictional account as the vehicle. This book is badly written. Besides multiple typos and bad grammar, the author hasn't been clever enough to develop the characters at all, to make the story believable. So no wonder the publicity kit confesses that it is a novel! Twice in the book she reveals her sexual obsession with her son, telling of dreams and fantasies. She isn't shy about it, her only regret is that in her fantasies her son isn't an attentive enough lover!!! No, this is one of the worst books I've read."
1,Grizzly H2867 Electric Sheet Metal Shear,This shear works only on flat surfaces. Bends in the metal will stop it immediately. The advertising should note that the shear works only on flat surfaces. I would not purchase this piece of equipment again.
2,Boring Book,"This book didn't have much substance to it. It was very boring and is hard to relate to. If you're a teenage girl and you want to read something exciting, don't waste your time on this book."
1,Sad Waste Of My Money,We cancelled the Charlotte Observer to get this low on substance and old news. I'm a native Brit and thought I would be getting something akin to the British version of the GuardianThis is really poor and a regrettable purchase by me.Please don't take into account the rave reviews here these people must not now about the news online.....Ah well 52 weeks and I'll be unsubbed.....David
1,BIG disapointment,"I was reading reviews about this game, checking websites, and thinking this game was gonna be great. I rented it one weekend and it was a huge disapointment. I've seen better graphics on a 64, and theres only about 8 guns! it was so boring after 10 minutes. do not buy this game unless you have rented it first and have liked it."
1,Three wheel failures within two months!!!!,"The 22"" Crew 6 has nice features and can hold almost a weeks worth of clothing. I like the removable toiletry bag and the removable ""suit"" section. However, the shoe bags are in the middle of the suitcase and make it difficult to pack around them. I wind up putting my shoes in the mesh pocket on the top. This works out ok but there wasn't a lot of thought to the placement of the shoe bags.But the real problem that I have with the 22"" Crew 6 is I have had to replace a total of three wheels and housings in two months. The wheel housings fail and the wheels rub against the housing, self destructing the wheel and making it very difficult to pull.Travelpro and a regional Travelpro repair shop have been great about replacing the parts but there is obviously a design flaw. I travel about 2 weeks a month and used an inexpensive suitcase for almost two years before it failed. I shouldn't be having these kind of problems."
1,Travelpro Crew 6 sucks,"Bought a Travelpro Crew 6 22"" rollaboard suiter. The FIRST time I used it the zipper broke. The THIRD time I used it, the handle pull off. Neither time was it checked as baggage."
5,One of my favorites,"I just finished reading Dead End, and it was one of my favorites of the Fear Street series. The only thing I would have changed is the fact that so many people die (which happens in most books). Other than that, it was really good!"
1,Not for the clumsy,"I have no idea how this product works. The lead cable must be clipped into a socket with a plastic retainer with a delicate plastic placement clip that breaks on contact. Can't replace that clip. Can't use the laptop. Pitty, for the want of a horse shoe nail a kindom is lost. Have to buy a new laptop. This product is not for the clumsy."
5,"Most helpful ""I Ching""","for me right now. And has been for the last 8 years. I refer to others sometimes (whether Cleary, or the Kuan Yin versions, LeGuin's is fun, Wing's workbook amazing, and the seminal but difficult to interpret translation by Legge). And have been intrigued by Karcher's when I've browsed in the bookstore, also recommended by one of my teachers.This one always speaks to me when I consult it, or simply study it. And the introduction to chinese cosmology in the first section is so well written and an excellent introduction for beginners.I'd recommend that beginners browse through the many books offered out there. This one came highly reommended by my teachers, and I continue to use it. Find one (or preferably several) that speak to ""you"". We all have our own path in the Tao to follow, pick your guide with your teacher or you own intuition."
2,Warning Stay Away from Magix,"This company has very bad support. I purchased the cleaning lab version 3.0, you had to buy the mp3 plug in from magix, when my hard drive crashed, I made several attempts to re enter the software, but could never get the MP3 to work. Numerous Emails went un-answered, I finally got a response after several weeks, suggesting that I pay another registration fee, I deleted the program and threw it in the trash, a $70 lesson learned. Buyers beware!!"
2,Foreign,"They look cheaply made, I got rid of them. This product is Made in Taiwan, I don't go for that, shame on me for believing the reviewer below."
3,"Pretty good, could be better","Having taken the 106 series, I don't find Roberts' book particularly engaging. While very precise, the book isn't written in a very clear way."
5,"the *real* jonb@leland.stanford.edu says ""excellent book!""","hello. i have no idea who wrote the review above but back off!! i am the real jonb@stanford.edu, and I am also an ex-TA for eric roberts (i worked in the cs106 program at stanford for 2 years). I think this is a fabulously written book, very insightful and well-written by one of the greatest computer science educators in the country. eric has a very accessible writing style, and this book is a must for those interested in extending their understanding of the C programming language with recursion, data structures, complexity and even a bit of object-oriented programming."
4,Great purchase,The used book that I purchased was in excellent condition. I have already read the Purpose Driven Life. I plan to read the book again this time using my journal
4,HAPPY GO LUCKY MEETS LOGIC,"Can be a bit too upbeat at times, a bit redundant, but overall a very inspirational book. I tell you if you are someone who doesn't think allot and are looking for some insight this book is perfect for you. If you are a deep thinker and get about 3 or 4 hours of sleep because your brain just won't shut off you probably have already mulled this over and over in your mind long before you read the propositions in this book. Either way it's still a fantastic read for entry level thinkers and tortured souls alike :)"
5,Purpose Driven Journal,"Wonderful study enhancement. Beautiful to look at and wonderful to hold, this journal is the perfect compliment to the book."
1,Damaged,It was damaged. I could not use it. It was bought to be given as a gift and I had to apologized to the person
2,mixed feelings,"bought for my bf to use with his phone he says that it swivels nicely, as advertised.i also found it difficult to detach from the belt clip and he also found the same problem.we are looking for a better one."
2,agree cover doesn't line up,"the holes for the side buttons and the center round navigation wheel don't line up, not even close. otherwise it is a nice cover."
1,Pathetic,"Why I actually finished this book is still a mystery to me. It is about teenagers who want sex and try to find sneaky ways to get it. The characters are totally unbelievable and nothing like any real life people. I'm in high school, like the characters, and I know no one as stupid as the people in this book, except for the idiots everyone with any brains in my school avoids. I can't believe a grown man would put his name on this crap. I don't see how this book got 5 stars. Don't read this book, it is definatly not worth it."
5,Applies to ALL compulsions,"WOW! This book has shed some light on my life like nothing else! The key is to be open enough to apply Geneen's teachings to ANY compulsive behavior - workaholism, perfectionism, unhealthy attachment to another specific individual, drugs, sex, alcohol, smoking, food, etc. Her book does not include exercises of any sort, so I just sat and reflected on each new insight, writing out my thoughts on the matter, and my past experiences, pondering new ways to address future situations. The coping mechanism of compulsive behavior is what a child with few or no coping skills, and no power, employs in order to survive; as an adult, this mechanism no longer serves. I am grateful to Geneen and forever changed for the better!"
1,Hilarious!,This is quite possibly the most unintentionally funny thing I've ever read. Her poor boyfriend Matt deserves a book of his own to tell us what living with this neurotic mess is truly like.
4,Not bad but if you can afford it go newer,I've had this product for four years and have had two of the problems mentioned.After about 2 years it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 20 minutes like mentioned.It won't play songs purchased on iTunes sometimes. Sometimes it will and sometimes it won't.I just upgraded to an iPod Touch and LOVE IT! This one is much cheaper though and like another said get it new and be prepared for these problemes down the road. Otherwise it's a great player.
2,Could be better,"The iPod mini isn't a bad little personal music player. Unfortunately, it isn't a good one, either. It has a few issues.Most significantly, many people (including me) have had problems with the iPod suddenly refusing to play music purchased from the iTunes store. Apple is characteristically unsupportive. Be prepared for some potential frustration.After a few months of use, the click wheel can get stuck. While many people love it, I would prefer some good old-fashioned buttons that have less of a tendency to clog up with the detritus of life.Overall, it has a good sound and is a decent unit for the money."
3,Decent Keyboard Tray,"For the price (especially on Amazon), this keyboard tray is OK. Out of the box, there is very little hardware - four brackets and some screws. Now, the installation part....Upon installation, the brackets are very flimsy. Although the tray is tightly secured to the desk, it moves and shakes because the brackets bend very easily. The screws are also very cheap, and strip easily. Lastly, the gel wrist provided in the box is nice material - but not comfortable at all. I had to use another one.I type 8 hours a day. Would I purchase this item again? probably not. Fortunately, my employer reimbursed me for this item.Do a little research. Amazon is great, and may have another tray for cheaper. Don't be mislead by the 3M sticker."
4,Could be worth it,"paying an extra 60 dollars for a few extra stuff could be worth it, i mean if i had the money i would definitely buy this, but as for now, il just wait."
1,Awful,"Just looked this up and watched a few episodes on you tube. It's absolutely awful. Just a bunch of teenagers trying to make a tv series with awful voice overs. How on earth do they think this thing is worth a $160? You can get a good series with professional actors, camera crews, etc..... for less than that."
5,"the best gate, the best price","I believe I reviewed this product the last time I bought 3 of them. Well, I bought another- yes, it is that good.The gate is unstained wood- you can stay or paint any color to match your decor. Very simple in decision, cannot be climbed or opened by child. Unless you're an idiot it's not hard to open (I have 2 relatives who can't seem to open it, but they can't figure out a TV remote either).We have these gates on either opening to family room, and at top and bottom of stairs. Very secure, I have no concerns about its' safety at all. My son (now almost 2) stands on the bottom bar of all of these gates and shakes them- atleast once a day each. The first 3 I purchased we have had up for about a year and they still work as well as they did the day we bought them.I HIGHLY recommend!"
3,Dissapointed,It would have been a good idea to let the customer know that they also have to buy an installation kit to install the gate. I actually thought that everything needed to install the gate was in the box.
1,don't waste your money,"at first i thought that this gate was great. however, it fell apart after a week. great idea, terrible workmanship. i would not recommend this to anyone who wants to keep a baby safe, its just a waste of money."
1,unsafe on top of the stairs.,"We bought ours at Lowes. We were so happy because it looks good, it's lightweight, and easy to open. However, after installing it on top of our stairs, I question my husband on how it swings... then all of sudden the spindle came off! The spindle was just glued on it! I was so shocked and returned it the next day. This should have been recalled."
5,Installed as designed,"The best stair gate. If it is installed correctly, the kids can not open it or go under it. We have two and highly recommend it. We tried 4 others and this is the one!!"
5,Versatile and Sturdy,"We love this gate! We purchased two, one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs. Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1. You can take the gate part off when not needed, yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2. Even 5 year olds still cannot open it. All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3. You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4. It's so cheap!These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate. Give it a try."
2,Gates are OK,These gates were ok but I still liked the quality better from the stair gates I got at http://www.stairgatestore.com. They had great accessories too.
1,Not good for us.,"#1 The template did not agree with our product. When you install something like this it's very important for the holes to be kept to a minimum for security, we had to make extra holes because of the faulty template. #2 If we yank on the bottom (latch side) it comes out making the gate unstable and we need it for the top of the stairs!! It might be too hard for a wee one to yank but ""might be"" is too much of a risk and it's not worth our babies safety!! We will have to take it down and try another brand."
5,The best thing Tony has ever done...,"Okay. If my house was burning down and I was to grab only one thing, it would be this CD. This is Tony at his very best, the Quiksilver work is outstanding, just the emotion it contains.Buy this one, if you never buy another TB CD, you won't have let yourself down!"
4,Zorro as literature? Who knew?,"Isabel Allende's Zorro is a thrilling biography of a fictional character. With her descriptive prose, she brings the legendary hero to life, literally, as she recounts his birth and childhood in California--long before the day he dons the mask for the first time. As the reader follows Diego De La Vega across the seas, one can't help but get caught up in the gripping plot that drives De La Vega's desire for revenge and justice. Fun and adventurous without being cliche or overly romanticized. The period, though not necessarily Allende's writing, remind me of The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers by Dumas. Definitely recommended for fans of Allende!"
1,"Not worth the money, even at $4.99","The video was not at all informative if that is what you're expecting to see. No mention was made as to how to call in a turkey, types of calls, how to use the calls, how to camouflage properly, etc. There were maps displayed of where one can find different species of turkeys, but you would have to put your VCR on hold to be able to study it! If you're looking for an instructional video, I would advise looking elsewhere."
3,"Funny, But Not Groundbreaking","Gone Madigan is an hour stand-up routine from Kathleen Madigan. I thought she was pretty funny, but her language can be a little salty. She doesn't really break any new ground (politics, health decisions, etc.), and she doesn't really have anything in her style that sets her apart - by comparison think of Jim Gaffigan's ""inner monologue"". I'm not sure if this is something that I will watch over and over, but it is worth a single viewing. Happy viewing."
4,"We really enjoy it, cool 3D animation with irony",Hard to find 3d animation that has something to say. Enjoyed the irony and the animations look cool and original.Never seen anything like it.
2,Download Everyone Has AIDs,U probably bought this for Everyone Has AIDs so I suggest download Everyone [...] yeah but the film is much better u wont stop laughing at the film
4,daring and delightful,"A unique and eye catching perfume bottle - curved with a marron glace copper lace corset for a luxurious wrap.Top notes are rose made even more mysterious by a tad of rum and orchid. Base notes include mere hints of vanilla, sandalwood and sweet amber.A rare scent best for evening and special occasions."
3,Lasted for two years....,"After a couple years the card actually began falling apart, still works but the plates (front/back) split apart at the top causing the safety lock tab to fall out occasionally. I would recommend SanDisk to anyone looking for a good card...my 256 MB SanDisk has lasted for much longer than this 1 GB Patriot. Now granted, I haven't used the 256 MB as much as this since I've had it, but it's still older and has still held up better.Bottom line: go with SanDisk cards instead"
4,Worth every penny,"Even with the annoying typos, this book is worth every penny, if only for the instructions on debugging com objects"
3,I'm waiting for RAVE in November,"Okay, I'm a die-hard Prince fan and this CD would only please people who follow his career. It's got some interesting stuff, but on the whole it is not one of my favorites. I think ""OLD FRIENDS FOR SALE"" is the standout track in my book. Nice to see Sheila E included on some early tracks. Scary thing is this was taken from tracks from 1984-1994, or somewhere close to that. Yet they all sound like jazz-fusion, and make a complete album. Too bad it's not one of his more brilliant throw aways. My money is on RAVE in November. Until then, this will do but only because I am a fan. Everybody else steer clear of this one!"
1,should have stayed in the vaults,nothing special at all.another run of the mill songs that were kept away for a reason.nothing on this disc is up to his 80's standards.
4,It's Prince,"While it is true this album could arguably be called ""The Worst of Prince,"" understand that Prince's ""worst"" is still far better than many artists achieve in a lifetime.Being a recording artist myself, I'm uncomfortable with the fact that these are cuts Prince never intended to release. I wouldn't like somebody going behind my back and putting stuff I didn't want heard out on the airwaves. Then again, I also understand that sometimes we are our own worst critics, and when you have as much talent and genius as Prince...maybe it's best to let it go and see what happens.This isn't a bad album. Fans of Prince's older, pop-oriented stuff will surely devour this CD and come back for seconds. I liked it. If you're comparing it to most of Prince's other work, you may find it lacking. Taken on its own merit, however, it is...well, Prince!"
3,"Entertaining, With Reservations...","Obviously Prince would never have released this material were it not to complete his contract for Warners. That having been said, any chance to hear some of what resides in his musical vault is welcome by me. It's About That Walk, 5 Women, When The Lights Go Down, Sarah, and Old Friends For Sale make this set worthwhile. I do agree, however, with some of the commentators who've stated that the version of Old Friends included here doesn't equal the more stripped down and personal version that has been floating around for years on bootleg."
4,surprisingly good,"When I heard WB was releasing The Vault, I was expecting a collection of throwaway songs that Prince could care less about out. WRONG! What I found was a collection of extremely well-crafted tunes from the most important artist of the last 20 yrs. ""Vault"" finds Prince exploring smokey jazz club music, blues and a little bit of broadway, ala Sondheim or Gershwin. ""It's About that Walk,"" ""Old Friends 4 Sale,"" ""3 Women,"" and ""There is Lonely"" are great tunes. Any Prince fan, as well as any fan of the conventions of American music, will love this one."
2,Review...,"I ordered this item to use with multiple pairs if Bose speakers. The speakers come with tined speaker wire appears to be # 14 or 16.I had about a 30% failure rate due to the screws being too short to really clamp the wire. If you tightened the screws sufficiently, they would strip. I tried enlarging the holes in the plastic and this was of some help bearing down on the screws. They still stripped.Otherwise they met the needs of my application.I had to order a second bag of them in order to fill my needsBobb Partridge"
5,Great quality and great price!!,"Excellent results with 14 gauge wire from Monoprice, as well as old 14 gauge Monster THX wire (both in-wall type).. Sometimes it might take more than one try to get the screw to hook the wire, but when it does it stays on really nice. Good design and excellent value, recommended!!"
1,"Even if they were giving these away, they are not worth it...","I didn't consider all the other negative reviews for this product... Now I get to write my own negative review... Actually, just read the other reviews... Everything's true, nobody made anything up. Avoid this product, absolutely worthless."
1,This product is a wast of money,Thank God for the internet I can tell you i rceived a rice steamer cooler for christmas and it is the worst product. The fist one stoped woring after the first time I used it. The replacement stemer tray fall into the water why can't a company such as yours make a reliable product. You will fail as a company if you don't fix your product quality control;
4,A Tale Honest and Well-Written,"Fr. Nolan, who recently died, went on to be a valuable contributor to Catholic Church life in Tennessee for many years. Among his many gifts was that of a teacher. He was mine over 10 years ago. He was an extremely gentle and intelligent person and his writing in this short work about his first years in religious life relects that. It is a good read.Rest in peace, Fr. Nolan!"
1,A promo video for present-day Donavur,"I bought four different missionary bio type videos to help me prepare to teach a class on the Pioneers of Missions. This was the only one that was not helpful. It is not primarily the story of Amy Carmichael. Most of the time is taken up with showing the present-day activities of Dohnavur Mission. I felt that I paid for a promo video of this mission instead of what it was supposed to be, the story of a great missionary pioneer."
5,A must for James Dean fans,"This wonderful biopic of Hollywood icon James Dean begins with his early estrangement from his father, continues with his struggles to be an actor in New York, and ends with his three starring movie roles. Along the way, he falls in love and finally learns the reason for his father's coldness.James Franco gives the performance of his career as Dean. First of all, the physical resemblance is amazing. Franco has mastered Dean's speech, movement, and mannerisms as well as his passions and fears, and if you're a Dean fan, you'll feel like you're watching the man himself. I only wish this made-for-TV film had been shown on the big screen; its powerful emotion deserved a bigger showcase.The story focuses on Dean's loneliness and conflicted feelings about his distant father (well-played by Michael Moriarity) and has many heart-breaking scenes. James Franco's fine performance makes this one of the very best TV movies I've ever seen."
5,James Franco is James Dean!!!!!!!!!,"ANY Franco/Dean fan will be blown away, this was not a well known movie as it was made for TV. It is a little on the expensive side but well worth it to add to your collection."
5,Good book for our beautiful granddaughter!,The book: A is for Abigail was in mint condition and an excellent gift for my granddaughter whose name is Abigail. Can't underline title from here.
2,Are there only white women in America?,"On the one hand we can't complain too much about a book celebrating women. However, we also can't ignore the utter whiteness of this book. Yes, there are a few non-white faces in this book, but not nearly enough to make it truly representative of all the wonderful women who have contributed to our America. Read Dinner at Aunt Connie's House by Faith Ringgold and you will meet some of the amazing black women, for example, that Cheney leaves out.As long as we perpetuate whiteness as ""neutral"" or ""representative of all"" our society will never be an equal one.The fight continues."
2,disappointing,"While it has it's bright moments, there are far better books out their. I guess I expected more from this author. Hollywood is fun but there are more imporant figures to promote involved in science, engineering and chemistry. Does Jesus all want us to be ornaments? Give me a break!"
4,Great Insiders Story,"This book is a great read for any emerging or established filmmaker. It provides an interesting and intimate story of two brothers struggle to make independent feature films. Throughout retelling their journey the brothers pass on useful knowledge, tips and allow the reader to learn from their mistakes. This book gets right down to specific problems on and off set and exactly how they dealt with them and the results... it has a refreshing straight-to-the-point style of writing, and taught me a few things about the Hollywood system that I didn't know. This book will inspire you to work harder and wiser to get your films made."
4,What a great book!!!,This is a good book for people of all ages to read. Its main character Fich is a girl who was badly bured as a child. After her mother passed away she was left to take care of her father. They both lived in a cementary but when her dad died she was left alone. being alone she descovers that she can talk to the dead.This book has many interesting twists and keep the reads very intersted. As Finch goes on in life she uses the advice the dead share with her to make her life better. this is a good book for people of all ages.
4,We Belong To The Earth,"Yes, there is an interesting plot here; but the HUGE piece is this: the book gives us an infinitely fascinating picture of how we and our deaths may play out - not as an event, but a part of a larger drama. If we have to tell our stories after we die, can we not live lives here and now that are more full of mystery, soul, and enchantment? This picture expands, deepens, and widens our everyday life because it offers one more way out of a 'modern life' filled with 'stuff'."
3,not good enough,this book is okay. not as good as RAPTURE OF CANAAN. however it still had some interesting points and themes. wrtten very well but reynolds could have made the story more interesting.
5,Best racing game for DC yet!,"Le Mans has the graphics, the cars, and the power to deliver a very satisfying game. Sega GT is ok, more like a PSX GT clone, which never wasn't truly the ""best"" game. Le Mans still isn't the ""best"" ever but it certainly is close. Allowing for 24 cars on the screen is simply amazing! The graphics are the best for racing on DC yet! And then the price, ... where could you go wrong! The Test Drive series has always been off very poor quality, but with Le Mans this has truly been a 180 in terms of quality. Great job Infogrames!"
5,"No matter what people say, it's the BEST","To Audrey Hepburn fans everywhere, this is a must see and must have. The script is hilarious (""Oh, Maurice, I'm like so happy for you"" and ""I'm not that kind of a girl. Oh dear, maybe I am that kind of a girl!"") Audrey Hepburn shines in this movie, and William Holden plays the drunken, funny movie writer. No matter how bad the reviews of the famous people may be, this is a terrific movie. It made my laugh so hard I cried. And belive me, you won't want to miss when Audrey Hepburn's drunk and she's making up this story involving planes, horses, beaches, vampires, bats.... Well, I can't give it all away. See this one. Better yet, buy it. It's definately worth it."
1,A disappointing flop,"This movie started out rather promising. The story involves a movie-within-a-movie. However, the plot goes quickly from clever to inane. Despite having Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, the film could not be saved. They do the best with what they are given, which isn't much. The film bombed at the box office. I'm not the least bit surprised."
4,The evening news will never look the same...,"The recent election left me with an uncomfortable feeling. Many people that I know supported Kerry but didn't vote for him. Most cited reasons such as ""He is kind of wimpy"" or ""I don't think he is strong enough to lead us right now."" When I stumbled across Ducat's book, I found a spring board for exploring people's uneasiness with ""less than manly"" politicians"".Some of Ducat's theories aren't supported with enough evidence, but overall it is an interesting and slightly alternative view of politics and gender. Definately worth a read."
3,Quick-Pod Pro,"It is a good product, but the mirror on the end is very hard to see, and the plastic end would pop off. Had to use super glue to put it back together. If the mirror was clearer and a slight bit larger, and the construction was build for travelers, this would be an outstanding product."
3,Good for what it is,"I purchased the quick pod pro for use while kayak fishing. I like the mini tri-pod amd the large knob to secure the camera to the arm. Otherwise, the rest is plastic and I fear that my camera will snap loose and drop to the bottom of the gulf of Mexico. The length of the arm is also a little too short to be useful for anything other than a DMV style photo of yourself. However, if you don't have any friends it is a great way to get yourself into the photo."
5,Great book!,This is one of the best books in the market about the Manhattan Skycrapers. You don't read only the old buildings but also the new ones. I strongly suggest you to buy the 3rd edition.
1,I was almost burned by flames and sparks from this iron too!,While using this iron on 10/25/11 a burst of flames shot up from the base of the cord followed by a spray of sparks near my hand. The flames/sparks quickly stopped and I unplugged the iron. Upon inspection I found under the cord detangler wrap the power cord was burnt thru. The cord wrap cover made it impossible to know or tell that the cord may have been frayed or damaged thus making the iron unsafe to use. A poor product design that the Consummer Product Safety Commission needs to address. I will file a report and I encourage other to do so too.
2,"Tough and functional, but clunky - better for larger hands","Solid, straight cast-aluminum transplanters like this one are fabulous in the garden. They last forever, no matter how you abuse them. I have several thinner ones I bought years ago. I keep one in my pocket whenever I'm in the yard and use it constantly to transplant small plants, pry out weeds or carrots, scrape the shovel, clean under the mower, etc. My transplanters are green and have occasionally spent winters hiding in the garden or compost pile with no damage. I wanted to buy another for my daughter. This Rumford Garden Pro Transplanter is tough and light like my old ones. The angle is nice, but unfortunately it is too large in both the blade and handle for smaller feminine hands. It is also green, which makes it easy to misplace in the summer garden."
3,"NEITHER ""GAY-THEMED"" NOR GAY-FRIENDLY","This well-intentioned film makes a serious attempt (truly astonishing for its era) to dramatize the plight of prison inmates who are denied (over long periods of time)the opportunity of occasionally indulging their natural sexual cravings. This denial of what we now call ""conjugal visits"" (the film argues) can lead to near-madness, suicide and (incidentally) to homosexual activity. But it's absurd to call this a Gay-Themed Film. There is only one brief episode of male-to-male contact in the film and it is discreetly suggested and lasts only a few seconds; yet this one moment of weakness becomes a source of overwhelming guilt and shame for the main character. So this film is not about homosexuality. It is about a straight man in prison in desperate need of a human touch. [In fact, of the three KINO ""Gay-Themed"" films, only DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS really deals directly with homosexuality as a social and political issue.]"
5,"For Brats, This book could change your life","It's been over 10 years since I originally bought this book. Mary Edwards Wertsch did not reach her own conclusions about life as a brat, but instead brought together through interviews, scores of of us to share their life experiences. Even at age 53, I still cannot answer a simple question, ""Where are you from?"" It also clearly documents that life in the military is not a job, but a career experience for an entire family.This book illustrates the challenges many of us faced growing up and the similarities we have had in adulthood. It also helps brats, like myself, understand some of the public service values we inherited from years of family public service.I have bought five copies to share with other friends who are brats. The stories in this book served as a unifying experience for all of us."
3,Self Reflection,"Military Brats appears to be more of a self reflection and 'therapy' for author Wertsch. While I sympathize with Wertsch's and others that can relate in the way she was brought up, I cannot myself. As an Army officer's brat, I can identify with the moves, new friends, the '3 yr itch', etc., but the majority of the negatives that come out of this book (my unscientific findings is roughly 80% negative) was not experienced by myself or a majority of my friends.In my opinion I would caution non-Brats about taking this as 'gospel' on how things where for us."
4,Great for beginners,"While this book is a great book for a beginner cardmaker, I found it rather boring for my skill level. For a beginner it's a great deal, and would help with getting started. The directions are clear and the list of items needed is well written.All in all, if you are just starting out making cards this would be a good one for your library."
2,The Big Book of Handmade Cards and Giftwrap: Over 50 Step-by-step projects,This book is good if you already have the little tools to work with. I was expecting it to be like a cricut hand made card.
5,Pure Lounge music,"Trip hop and lounge lovers need to have this CD at home. Bajo Fondo Tango Club is not as pure tango as Piazzola's nor as chill out percolated as Gotan Project's, which makes them a band for all publics. Nor even one single person in my office couldn't help download at least one song of this CD into their ipods. Three of them already bought their copy."
3,Good album,"All I've read here is half true.This album was not just made by argentinean people but also by uruguayian people (Uruguay and Argentina are neighbour countries and they share the passion for the Tango music).There are several tracks made by uruguayians and track number 6 (Perfume) is an original song written and executed by two contemporary uruguayian artists being one of them Jorge Drexler, a well known musician in South America and Spain.Now, the album is good, not great, but very good.I bought it and I'm happy with my decision"
3,Can't beat it for the price.,"I'm very satisfied with the kit, it provides a lot of ink for the price and they print very well. My only problem is that my color cartrigde is going after only two refills, the black has survived over 4 refills with no end in sight. I'm using an HP Officejet 6310xi All In One with one three color cartridge and a black. I've tried using a head cleaner solution on the color cartridge from another kit but it seems to be only a temporary fix. I've soaked the thing for a week which keeps it working for about a day, then back to skipping out and clogging.I have'nt tried the photo inks yet, as I'm having trouble with the color cartridge. Maybe it's the inks, I don't know. Think I'll experiment with a different kit and a new cartridge just to compare before I decide."
3,The better game receives the lower quality conversion,"On the PC, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament seem to be the biggest names in the FPS genre. Quake 3 was released on the Dreamcast and although it had it's problems, it was an excellent conversion. Now comes Unreal Tournament, which is sadly, not acceptable in many cases. Although to me it seems faster than the PS2 version (the load times especially), both console conversions pale in comparison to the PC original. If you have a capable PC, stick with the original and still best version. If you don't, you'll still enjoy the Dreamcast version because most of the game remains intact (if a little slow).NOTE to importers in Europe: This game will not play through Peritel/RGB/Scart."
1,A major disapointment,"I love Nadja, she is a goddess of the violin, in fact two days before I purchased this CD I heard her in person, but this album just falls flat. I believe that the two people who heard her and the Assads in person heard great performances, but this studio recording is lifeless. It sounds like New Age music. And the Assads are Brazilian classical guitarists with a little pinch of Gypsy flavoring, not enough to spice up the mix. If you want to hear the authentic thing, listen to Tomatito. If you want a Gypsy-classical mixture that is far more exciting than this, try Gilles Apap and the Transylvania Mountain Boys."
3,Not Land's Best But An OK Read,Not his best. Too much mysticism made it hard to take seriously. I've read many of Land's books and was a little disappointed in this piece.
3,Dumb plot line,"I never read Land before and didn't know what to expect. While the characters held some interest, the plot line was too outrageous to be believable."
3,"Nice, quick read","McCracken is a bit over the top, but the main idea is pretty good (especially for when it was written)."
4,"pretty, nice little ring","I'm wearing this ring as I type. It's pretty, true to the picture and true to size. This is a great, fun little bit of jewelry at a nice price."
5,Love sour apple? Love bubble gum? You'll love this product,I must confess that I am addicted to these and am thrilled to be able to purchase them in bulk. Great price for a yummy treat!
2,doesn't fit my beetle,"I just purchased this item and had to return it. It does not fit my 2000 Beetle. There is no lip over the rear window on my car to secure the bar. It was easy to return, Wish I had known it doesn't fit my car."
5,Free Individual,The principles in the book 'On Becoming a Person' are good for anyone who loves all ideas on the Free Individual. Scientists who like theories of Personality must know this book.
2,Not for beginners,"This is not a book per se. It is a collection of lectures, speeches, talks, and papers from 1940 to this books original publication in 1961. Not really worth the price of admission. Go for one of Rogers more mainstream books. Not for beginners."
2,revolutionary?,"carl roger's work revolutionized nothing whatsoever, but that's not the problem w/ it. the truth is that he was just a stupid man who thought and wrote w/ utter stupidity, beyond even the theological realm.in his youth nietzsche was immature enough to write an essay attaching david strauss. he was right, though such an effort was hardly worth his time. i think carl rogers is probably the david strauss of our time. that he was highly honored in his life time, and is even today, is a disturbing indication of the sterility of american psychology . carl rogers does not represent a humanistic psychology. the lack of humanism is the major characteristic of his blind optimism."
5,Could save a relationship or a life!,"This book does an excellent job of teaching a person how to behave in a relationship, so that each of the parties in the relationship can flourish. Recently, a friend of mine was feeling suicidal and the knowledge that I gained from reading this book, helped me to help them find an alternative solution to the problems they were having. On Becoming A Person is an owners manual for living."
2,The ID dimension is incorrect,"The design is pretty much standard, as far as post drivers go but if you are considering a purchase you would do well to note the shorter 23"" pipe length (many other drivers are 36"" long) which corresponds to a shorter max stroke (meaning a lot more pounding might be necessary). However my real gripe with this one is the Inside Diameter that is stated to be 2-7/8"". For my particular needs I required at least a 2-3/4"" diameter or larger, so this driver should have worked. But it didn't! The true inside diameter is a little less than 2-3/4"" which is then made worse by the shape not being fully round, but instead being a bit flatten on the welded side. So the largest diameter I could find was just short of 2-3/4"" and in places it was reduced to less than 2-3/8"". So beware! if the inside diameter is important for your purposes."
5,Good Product,I have been using this product for several weeks now. It works just as advertised. I am re-habbing from degenerating cervical disks and I need moist heat to help loosen up my neck muscles and do stretching/strength exercises. This neck wrap works very well. I pop in the microwave for about 21/2 minutes and it retains it's heat for 15-20 minutes. I would recommend this product to others.
4,Neck Wrap,Warms up very nicely. Retains the heat. Is comfortable to wear.It is light and it is not heavy to wear. It also helps to relax you.
3,It smells funny,This product smells funny like cloves and cooked rice with thyme. The smell is a little too intense. But it has a nice organamic shape.
3,moist/ with odor,It is a very moist heat wrap. The odor however is very strong and a bit irritating to the eyes.
2,Uneven heat; overwhelming aroma,"I bought this to replace my husband's Thermalon neck wrap because of the washable cover. However the 3 bags of beads do not cover the entire interior surface of the wrap, so you are left with uneven heat distribution. Also the herbal aroma is strong and lingers; we do not find it pleasant. It takes 3-4 minutes in the microwave to heat up sufficiently but does retain the heat nicely--better than the Thermalon. However, the Thermalon heats sufficiently in about 90 seconds. Guess we'll stick with the Thermalon and just reheat it more often as needed. As others have mentioned, beware the metal zipper--we also suffered a scorch mark on ours."
5,A Page Turner,"I must say I enjoyed reading this book. I loved the journey through history, it is something about learning your family tree and seeing the things the family went through to get to where they are today. Sherry discovers a lot about herself and her family. I think we all can see a little bit of ourselves in Sherry, but Sherry was bold enough to express her real feelings.Bernice, this was wonderfully written, i can't wait for the next one. How long must we wait......Summer is almost here."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this CD. I assumed there would actual duets by Rosemary & Betty Clooney, but such is not the case. It is Betty Clooney on her own."
2,Not a favorite,"Good photography. However, there was no personal identification of the subjects (although a few were very recognizable). I also felt that the author was inaccurate in her explanation of some of the photos and a few other comments she made throughout the book. All in all, not a favorite of mine."
3,How Many Can-Can Girls Can A Killer Kill Until He's Caught?,"Filmed in '58, 'The Haunted Strangler' is a somewhat entertaining English horror/murder mystery from '58 starring the legendary Boris Karloff.Plot: Set in London, England circa 1860, accomplished writer James Rankin (Boris Karloff) develops an obsessive interest in a twenty year old series of can-can girl killings. His investigation into the matter eventually unveils a harsh (and I might say totally expected) reality bringing dire and deadly circumstances when the truth is finally uncovered.While Boris Karloff delivers a fine performance, the real interest in this now OOP DVD is the presence of the very sexy Vera Day in the role of the ill-fated Pearl, the first victim in a new series of killings. Vera was a very popular model in England in the mid-to-late fifties. Of the few films she appeared in, 'The Haunted Strangler' is the most successful at showing this incredible beauty to the appreciative audience."
5,Brilliant writing and photos of the worlds best adventure athletes,"The idea of the this book is so great i am surprised i haven't seen it done yet: find the best adventure athletes and interview and photograph them at their favorite places to play. The photography is awesome and the profiles do a great job of getting into the lives of the athletes. some of my favorite stories are of ""the making of the book adventures"" that show just how involved in the action the writer and photographer got. The stories of Corey getting airsick paragliding and getting talked into Base jumping by Shane McConkey and his girlfriend Kim are laugh-out-loud funny."
3,Had a Hard Time Caring,"Kellerman has given his usual good read, however, I had a hard time mustering sympathy for his victim. An obnoxious teen growing up to a high price hooker is not a character I could relate to.Also, the end seemed almost too quick; like he reached his quota of number of pages and needed to finish fast.Nevertheless, it was an entertaining read."
3,It's better than THE WEB,Mr. Kellerman seems to be getting back on track for Alex and Milo in his new novel. But there are two major mistakes that should have been caught by a able editor and even the author himself and that is the disappointment in this book.
4,Nice little coffee maker,"I owned a black and decker coffee maker for almost fouryears and suddenly it died and it was not programmable.Naturally, I checked out the reviews listed here @ Amazon for alittle feedback. The previous reviews for this coffee makerprompted me to check out this item in person. I was impressedwith the construction of this unit, the price, the features, and the wattagefor this thermal coffee maker. I love it!!!! Cleaning it is a breeze.I love the combination of black and stainless steel...awesome!The controls are simple and easy to use and programming it forthat wonderful ""wake me up"" first cup of coffee is my favorite feature.I love that the coffee stays hot for @ least four hours. The thermalcarafe is very well-constructed. Oh and for the most importantquestion...yes, this coffee maker brews a good, strong, hot cup ofcoffee. Will be buying again!!"
4,Now here's a fun game to play...,"You liked playing sniper in MOH right? Well have fun with this one gang! The missions are tough, but fun. the graphics are pretty good, not great, but good enough. You have to use your head sometimes to avoid being killed or detected, but it's a great game and I would say well worth the money. This one's a sleeper. Never heard any advertising or promo's for it, but I stumbled onto it and had a great time. I highly recommend it. I'm a hard-corps combat gamer and I love this one. You won't go wrong with it, believe me. You usually have a choice of a number of different weapons and you can pick up weapons from the VC you kill. It's exciting at times and a bit scary in spots. The VC hide pretty good, so be wary or you'll be the victim... AND, this game has saves and plenty of them so you don't have to worry about that... Buy it, you'll be glad you did."
2,Could have been better.,"I was really hoping this game would be good, unfortunately I didn't like it.The Pros:Its a great idea.The voice acting is pretty good.The graphics were better than I expected.The motions are quite realistic.The sounds are awesome.The Cons:Bad AI (After 1 shot everyone in the map suddenly seems to know where you are, its incredibly hard to be stealthy in this game, and hiding doesn't do anything. Even when they shouldn't be able to see you, they shoot and kill you within 6-8 shots.)Sniping is to easy.Your able to walk directly up a wall face. It seems to be a glitch, one that could have been fixed.In night missions you are given a rifle with a night vision scope on it, which makes it nearly impossible to use.Multi-player is fun but in most games people just use the hugely overpowered Grenade launcher and spawn kill.I had high hopes for this game, but ultimately it failed."
5,A pageturning horror!,"This book might not be the best Fear Street, but you will never guess who is the killer until you get to that page!"
2,The Literacy Map: Guiding Children to Where They Need To Be,"Richard Gentry's book is full of information, other researcher's information. I was disappointed in the constant use of other's ideas. I do find the benchmarks at the end to useful. I was hoping, however, for new ideas to add on to other leaders in educations research, instead it was just revisited again."
3,Inspiring,I can see the value of this great book but the print is quite small and all the F's are all capital S's throughout the entire book. Apparently it's how they wrote F's back in the 1700's. It's not easy for kids too read the small print with the strange F's.I'd like too find this in an edited version with the F correction and in bigger print.You can see why they were able too build this great nation and why we're ruining it. They were brought up too read the scriptures and were strong of character.
2,Good for A While But Broke,"I had this for a bit and it worked well enough until the plastic clip broke. When the clip broke, my mp3 player fell to the ground. Luckily it was protected in the case, but now it was no longer useful."
5,Bibliophiles to Rare Bookdealers - Book Interests & Collectors,"The magazine offers insights into the rare book business and information for the general book enthusiast or collector. It lists upcoming book fairs and events, as well as, articles pertaining to collecting, selling, and reviews of books in US and UK/Europe. The format is small enough to place in a tote or to carry and read on the bus. The Book Source Monthly is one of the best sources for unique subjects on or about books. The authors of the articles appearing in the BSM are not afraid to make a comment or state their professional opinions. Nice to see that its available on Amazon. Wonderful publication for bibliophiles (lovers of books)."
2,PAL FORMATTED- don't buy unless you know this,"My Australian in-laws wanted to give a bit of their culture to their granddaughter for her 4th birthday. They knew if they bought it at a store it would be the wrong region. So they went to Amazon (a U.S. company) and looked for a Bananas in Pajamas dvd. No where does it say that it's in PAL format. So they bought it through this supplier for Amazon. Day after her birthday we try the dvd- it won't play on our dvd player because it's in PAL format! No where on the box does it say it is- otherwise I'd have never opened it. The only way we could get it to play at all was through our computer. Good to know before you buy it. Otherwise the content is entertaining, if you can play it."
3,Average quality,"Hi!This unit advertises as being ""airtight"" and it is!...to the point that I had trouble opening it when it first arrived. The canister is nicely finished but thin and the plastic lid feels cheap. It hasn't broken on me, and it holds my coffee grounds, but I have seen much higher quality similar containers at Fred Meyer. I use it for camping so it doesn't have to be all that nice, just functional. I personally wouldn't want to put this in my kitchen. I use similar ceramic urns for that purpose which are much more stylish and sturdy."
1,Buyer Beware: Container dimensions/capacity misleading,"I purchased this item believing it to HOLD 52 ounces but rather, it holds about 10-16 ounces. Then I thought it may weigh 52 ounces but there is no way this product weights 3+ pounds - its light as a feather. Given this appearance of false advertising, coupled with the vacuum seal concerns by other reviewers, I would strongly caution prospective purchasers of this item to understand what you're buying before you click 'order.' I'm certainly returning mine."
4,Storage canister,"At first, I was disappointed, because it was smaller than I expected.But when I used it, I found that the size was much larger than I expected, by looking at it."
3,Keller,The canister spring is a little cheap but for the price this has been just fine for what we were looking for. The seller was quick to ship and we recieved this in a couple days!
4,Works for me!,"I use it to keep a week's worth of coffee I grind. The clamp mechanism and hinge are both well made and sturdy. Looks good on the counter. As a previous reviewer noted, the sealing ring does seperate from the cover, but is easily resolved with a couple of drops of glue. Nice product at a fair price."
1,FULL SCREEN MODE NOT FOUND,"If anyone can answer my problem I would be so greatful! I just bought Enter the Matrix for PC and i cant get it to work. I installed it, registered a direct X, i have windows media player 10! But all it says is FULL SCREEN MODE NOT FOUND. Whats wrong, how do I play it! Someone help me out, NOW."
2,Kinda dissapointed,"Let me start by saying that I have not completed the game but I'm afraid that I may never actually reach the end. Why? The controls on this game stink. When manipulating my character I'm always fighting the controls, which have a tendency to move your gaze up to high or down to low. This occurs when just looking side to side and is absolutely terrible when in a fight. Otherwise, everything seems pretty cool with the game (graphics and story). I wonder if a game pad might solve the control problem. If not, I don't know if I can finish it. The contols are way to annoying and difficult."
5,price,you price is too much you chould put the price like10.00 or 16.00so people can buy and have fun and it will work.
1,Save yourself the frustration and the money,"After 7 hours of trying to just install this game and various trips to the Atari tech support... I am now the proud owner of 4.... Enter The Matrix table coasters.How this company could release a PC game that can't even install correctly is beyond me. By far the worst game/product I have ever purchased on the internet or anywhere else. It is as close to outright ... that I have ever seen.This game is so full of bugs, you seriously have to be quite computer literate to have a shot at getting this to install let alone run on your PC.If anything get the console versions... save yourself the pure frustartion that is the PC version of this game.Horrible, absolutely positively horrible."
1,Exit the Matrix,"This is one of the worst games of the year. Even hardcore Matrix fans will be dissapointed in this product. If you want to play an action game with a matrix style of playing, get Max Payne and download the free Matrix MOD for it."
1,"Horrible, horrible experience","I love the movies, and the Reloaded movie has a review of this game. In the review they tell you there is an extra hour of video you can get no other way. So, even though I do not like this type of game I bought it anyway. I hoped I could make my way though the game well enough to get to the video. I could not. I made my way through a bunch of lame action and then got trapped on a plane with an agent. But it didn't start there. The install process was horrible as well. The installer for the game popped up with error after error. I'm very upset by all this. If they want to put out video that can be seen only through a game like this there needs to be a 'I hate games like this, just play the video for me' option."
4,"Good Story, but Still Flawed","Now, before any Matrix fanboys(or girls) jump on my back, just hear me out. Obviously I think this game will be definitly worth playing. The story looks great and the kung-fu looks incredible. However, the graphics are not up to par with what can be currently produced. Unfourtunatly, the controls are rather clunky. The ""Focus"" gimmic, while it looks very cool and fun, it promises to be rather difficult to use. And, the gimmic isn't even their own idea. Max Payne first came up with the idea. In conlcusion, I beleive Enter The Martix will be an average game, but it will be worth playing even if only for the story."
2,For the story,"First of all I am not saying that you shouldn't buy this but if you do not like the way it looks don't buy it. It looks really good from what they Say, and the story is good. But the Graphics stink, and the car chasing scene and fighting effects aren't that good. But if you want to hear the story you have to buy it. So I would not recommend that you buy this game unless you really want to hear the story. But thats not all the camera views are not that good either and the characters are really jerky. The AI is not that good either. But it does have some good things also. The sound is good, the music is good, some fights are good, the controls are ok and the movies are good. I hope this review has been helpful."
2,doesn't live up to hype,"The first level is repetitive and the second level turns into a jumping puzzle. The interface could use a lot of work (so much so that you can't even adjust the brightness without quitting the game and running their setup program). The game is also extremely buggy out of the box and you have to install the patch for the most mundane things (like being able to switch to windows, or use EAX sound)."
1,this game has problems!,this game had so many problems for windows version.the first problem was belive it or not i had instalation problems it always had erroes and would close down during installastion.so i decided well i will try again and returned the copy of the game for a new one.well lets just say i tryed instalation again on 4 differnent computersd and always errors they all met system requirments my dads was brand new.finally my friend got it on his coputer and then i played it and of course more problems it kept crashing so finally i gave up on matrix PC version.so i played it on PS2 and it was great with better controls.So dont by this game for PC i recomend PS2 version.
1,BUYERS BEWARE...take the blue pill,"If you had a choice to take the red pill or blue pill...I advise that you take the blue pill on this game.I have played many games in my day and i would have to say that ""Enter the Matrix"" is NOT an enjoyable game. It has to be by far the worst game out there currently. If the shoddy graphics doesn't make you sick to your stomach, the player's controls will. You have to have Neo's abilities just to work through the controls if the game. I actually put this game down and instead, went to play pick up stick because at least that was more engaging. The movie is awesome but don't let this part of the matrix have you...take the blue pill and avoid how deep this rabbit hole goes."
1,You get what you pay for,"This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2."
2,"Bad, bad game, I cried for hours","The game had a few cool features. I liked the fact that you didn't have to remember how to get to different locations, you simply had to visit it once and it was added to a list of destinations for you to pick from. The other cool feature was that it was a game...other than that, it felt like ""Get item, kill monsters, go to next level, get items, return with items, kill monsters"" The plot (as far as I got, as much as I tried to force myself to continue onward eventually even my self-loathing has a peak) was weak, the NPC's dialogue was horrid...I'm old school in that I actually care about plot in an RPG call me bizzare...if you want a good RPG, go get Might and Magic, or wait for Diablo 2. (though I always did like the M&M's better)"
1,Not Impeccable,"Along with a group of tenured female colleagues, I take issue with MOST of the advice in this book--it's embedded with all manner of weird prejudice (fat people are better than thin people; men are always dangerous; Emily Toth is God). The book espouses feminism but violates the basic precepts of feminism--taking risks, being humane, celebrating self and others. Why does she so rarely answer questions constructively? A bunch of us suspect that she makes up the letters herself, by the way--which makes the answers even more ludicrous.All in all, this book is a curiously defensive, gutless approach to surviving academic life--not creative or provocative or even useful in terms of practical advice."
2,Somtimes it works!!,"I have been using this for the past three months. What decided the purchase was the fact that it would link my Dell 9300 laptop with all my printers in my wirless network. For someone who doesn't know much about ""wireless networks"" it worked great, and the laptop found the printer perfectly.Now, the desktop which is ""wired"" to the router loses the software every time the machine starts which then up pops a error message to restart winXP or call Network Magic support. I restarted several times and had no luck. When I called Network Magic support the only help I recieved after explaining my problem was to reinstall windows and to see what happens after that.In other words this was no help at all after a reinstall still did not fix the problem.So the bottom line is that it is dead on my desktop but still functions on the laptop."
2,Took 1 week to return to a shape the pros at Discount Tire could actaully get on a rim.,"Shipped folded. The guys at Discount Tire tried for 30 mins to get it on a rim. I had to prop it open (with various devices) and leave it in the hot sun for 5 days (not kidding), and bring it back a second time. Then it only took them 15 mins to get it on the rim.There's no way you could do this yourself at home."
4,CROW'S FEET ARE FOR CROWS,"As all of us know, the eye area is one of the most sensitive areas on the face. Regrettably it's also the first to show signs of dryness or aging. We can call those fine lines ""traces of smiles,"" ""expressions,"" ""webs of experience,"" or whatever we wish. The truth is a line by any other name is still a line. Or, in most cases several of them.Cellex-C Advanced-C Firming Cream contains 10% Vitamin C plus a host of powerful anti-oxidants that are found to be the most effective around the delicate eye area. It was developed to increase skin's elasticity and relieve the look of sagging or lined skin above and below the eyes.It's a light formulation that absorbs quickly and is not greasy. The best process for using is to apply it once a day in the morning after cleansing. Be sure to avoid the upper eyelid and the brow area. Follow with moisturizer.After all, crow's feet are just for crows!- Gail Cooke"
1,Typical Skater Metal,"When I first heard the samples of these tracks at a local music store, I thought they were good. I thought, ""The breakdowns are great""...little did I know that the whole cd is a blasted breakdown. Breakdowns are meant to be used sparingly, and at the right moments. This cd just gets old after the first 2 plays. Hardcore metal is for the poopy-head that likes metal only for the ""intense"" feelings they get out of it. Skaters like it to pump themselves up and only for that reason. Take my advise and don't buy this cd. It's not kinky."
2,Not very helpful.,"I reviewed the daVinci tool separately before I realized I could review them both together (whoops). The back roller for me is not that great. I lie on a short-pile rug to exercise my back. To use the roller, I have to take off my shirt, as it will slide out of position between my shirt and the rug- those rubber traction jobbies at each end are practically useless. It helps a little with soreness between my shoulder blades, but either of these devices is overpriced."
5,"Great Quality Deep Sockets, at less than Half the price!","These are really great quality deep well sockets, with a nice finish,that will complete your socket set!Everyone who owns a car, motorcycle, boat, bicycle, mowing machine, or home,should have a complete tool set! These are so good as an addition forthose nuts that are threaded way down the threaded rod or screw!Hey, I bought three, so my mobile kit, home kit, and workbench each havea full set of sockets!Now, then, I also liked the PRICE, which, even with all the other greatTEKTON tools I bought with them, from AMAZON.COM, I saved at least HALFover any other source!"
5,Here we go!,"This album is fun of fun, cute, and sexy hits. It's sure to get you humming along and tapping your toes. Don't miss your chance to get this cd. She's on her way to the big time. Jennifer Webb is the next big hit."
3,"Great tool, but trash it when the bladder goes","This product works like a charm. However, once the inflatable bladder goes, it is finished, kapoot, done!! There are no replacement parts available, so hopefully you will get $70+ worth of service from it before it dies on you! Check out [...] They carry a similar product with replacement parts."
1,nothing new,"From the SK discussion:""I received Michael Herr's newbook KUBRICK from Amazon.com yesterday. Much to my surprise anddisappointment, this book is nothing more than a reprint of the two articles that he wrote for Vanity Fair magazine. I assumed that the previously published Vanity Fair material would be incorporated into this book, and greatly expanded upon. But no - they're all you get! There is no new material here, except for one photograph of Kubrick on p.64 that I don't think has been published before. The essays themselves are excellent, but you'd think it would include something besides material that had already appeared in two issues of a magazine that went for $3.95 apiece. Gary"""
1,Inferior product,"This cable is poorly made. Display picture is purple. Tried on several monitors - all purple. Checked computer's video output with another VGA cable - perfect picture. Apparently, at least one of the wires inside the cable is not properly connected to the external pins, resulting in partial transmission of video. Quality assurance for this manufacturer must be non-existent. I would highly recommend that you avoid this product."
2,I absolutely love holly but HOLLYS WORLD ..was boring!!!!,I loved the girls next door so much I still watch them to date! But I never got into this show! I don't know if it was because there was no more Hef or no more playboy mansion or what.! Holly was always my favorite and has such a funny quirky personality but this new hollys world show and the setting didn't appeal to me! Im pretty sure it was just the huge difference life had on her after she left the mansion!!
2,fragile,"I bought this clip, and it worked great for a week, and then broke at the swivel. I ordered 2 more thinking it was a fluke, and both broke at the swivel within a month. I've used other clips before with no problems. The swivel is FRAGILE!"
3,"Hey, Jean Harlow has done much better,","before & after Bombshell. How many times has it been said of this movie that art imitates life. The movie star playing a movie star, barely disguised & made funny. Her real life wasn't funny actually it was a bit too sordid for that. But she did have fun making this. She lampooned herself, Hollywood, agents, relatives & all the other parasites that lived off of her. All in the guise of fiction. That's the heart of this movie right there. There is even a lengthy reference to ""Red Dust"" an actual movie she made before this. First off Harlow was a great comedienne & second in my opinion a great & the first blonde beauty queen. But she did have better movies with plots before & after this. The aforementioned Red Dust, Wife vs Secretary & Saratoga to name three. Yes, this is a funny movie. It is also a bit sad from this distance, seeing these hi-jinks, a glimpse of her life & knowing what happened just a few years later."
2,Was not as good as I thought it would be,"Well.....Compared to kirk's past projects, this one just didn't do much for me. I think I only listened to it a few times. Then I gave it to someone esle. But I will still suport his future projects. He does have an anointed on his life and some thing to give to others."
1,CD-ROM - Cant be read by 3 computers,I could not install this software and tried on 3 separate computers. Each one could not read the disk. What a piece of junk.
2,Good for typing review,"I bought for my 8 year old and was disappointed it doesn't teach the basic skills. The games are fun, but frustrating for my daughter because they expect knowledge of finger placement that they haven't taught yet.My other daughter who already learned to type is having fun advancing her skills though"
5,woot,BULLETS BULLETS BULLETS. wow. still reveling in the awesomeness that was the bno show at chain. i loooooooove skye.
5,This is an awesome jump start to your day CD,Everyone who is everyone must get this CD.....although it doesnt do them justice for their live performance.....it is still as awesome as can be.....You must have this one night stand rock and roll band CD!!!!
2,....,".... Social realities are unbalanced and, like most north american books about Latin america, we stand glorified as we are handed reasons for pitying persons on the other side of the border. I recommend this to only those few with enough knowledge of border life to realize what an insult this book is."
3,The Crossing book review,This book is based in a border town between the US and Mexico. It is about a 14 year old boy named Manny Bustos who is homeless and wants to cross to america. It is also about Robert Loche who is a sergeant in the army. Over the course of the story the two meet and in the end the sergeant saves Manny and gives him the money to cross to the US.
4,R S H,"I think ""The Crossing"" is a good book because it shows you how some people struggle to surrvive.My favorite part of the book was at the end but i wont tell you ill let you read it for yourself. :)i think its interesting how Robert controls his friends and how he controls his drinkin;Him trying to keep his comrads out of his mind.i like the way he acts because he's really serious when ""The Man In The Mirror"" appears, but then when hes not there he acts kinder."
4,The Crossing,"This book, ""The Crossing,"" is about a boy that lives in the streets of Juarez in Mexico, where the story also takes place. This boy is trying to cross to the United States. He survives by begging money from the tourists that go to that city. Later in the story he meets a nice lady in a restaurant called the ""Two-by-four."" This woman sometimes feeds him, but she also helps him to make the crossing. The boy also meets an American Soldier, (a sergeant), who likes to drink a lot of whiskey. His relationship with the lady of the restaurant during the story is very nice, but the relationship he has with the American Sergeant is very different from the one he has with the woman. While you'll reading this story you will also find out a few problems the boy has with the sergeant and some other street boys, but at the end everything change."
1,Buggy,"I suppose this game might be fun if I could get it to run on my computer. When I try to get it to run my monitor goes black and I get a message stating that the monitor is out of scan range. After many e-mails to atari tech support with them telling me that I do not have the newest driver for my monitor I checked with microsoft and sony to see if there is a updated drivers for my configuration and they both told me that I have the newest driver... Anyway there is not one other program that does not run on my computer, so it is the game. I can not reccomend it..."
3,not bad,"This book was helpful with understanding the concepts. However, there are ""you try it"" problems through out the book with no answers or solutions so you have no idea if you did it correctly. I would recommend using this book only as a secondary method of learning."
1,Run away as fast as you can.,"Please do not purchase this book. The book will turn you from someone who wants to learn Calculus into someone who will forever be terrified of math. The book is just plain incomprehensible and the exercises do not have solutions provided.I tried to rate it ""0"" stars but apparently Amazon requires a minimum of ""1"" so I gave it ""1"" star.If you want to learn Calculus start off with Calculus for Dummies and the companion Calculus Workbook for Dummies.It is amazing how two books can teach the same thing where one book leaves the reader more confused than when they started and the other leaves the reader feeling that they have a grasp on the basics of Calculus."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with most of the negative comments posted here. I took several courses in calculus in college but wanted to relearn it quickly. Instead of dragging out my old texts, I bought of copy of this book. Big mistake. The volume is written for mathematicians. There are few practice problems, and the ones that are included do not have solutions! The chapter exams consist of extremely difficult problems, making the use of this text discouraging. I ended up buying Calculus for Dummies and using my old texts to get problem sets.I would add that I also bought the 'Demystified' volumes on linear algebra and differential equations, and both of them were quite good. The calculus volume seems to be a dud, though."
2,Poor Try,"Only a chuckle here and there. Mostly a poor try and very predictable. I was disappointed, expecially since the same gang did a great job on earlier projects. This looked like their rush to make a deadline was more important than the film istelf."
1,Awful,I love the twilight movies but I also love spoofs so i decieded to watch this movie. It wasn't funny and it made liberals look even more stupid than they already do. This movie was a joke. Don't bother. It is a huge waste of money.
2,This movie sucks!,Vampire's suck?More like this movie sucks.The jokes were lame.Not very funny.The only good thing about this movie is the actress that played Becca.I thought she did a fairly good job at spoofing Bella.Not a very good parody movie.
4,"A Great Book, But Lots of Blank Pages from Bad Printing !","I have always liked the tv version ""The Waltons"" and was excited to receive the book. However I was disapointed to get the book only to find, the Printer had done a terible job, which left many pages blank.Thank you Mr. Hamner"
3,Spencer's Mountain,I'm looking for the movie version of Sepncer's Mountain. Any idea on how to get it?Please email to myersrule@earthlink.net Thank you!
5,"If I owned just one book, this would be it","This book has to rate as one of the most beautiful I have ever read. John Stevens does a masterly job of turning into English the original Japanese poetry. Ryokan's compassion and simplicity are retained, along with his penetrative insight into the human condition."
5,Feels and works SO GOOD!,"My son's girlfriend is an esthician and she gave me this as part of a gift. I have your typical ""t"" zone going on - dry all over my face except for the oily ""T"" across my forehead and down my nose and chin. As I've aged, I've had a really hard time finding a product to help maintain a nice balance without it feeling heavy or causing a break out. This is it! My skin (face, neck and chest) feels lucious and looks great when using the marine moisture mask...and here's a little secret - you can even use it as everyday moisturizer when in a pinch. Awesome stuff!"
3,"Quick game, no challenge, great graphics / cinematics","For those of you who have not played the Tekken game series, it is a 3D fighting game; that uses the same button configuration as Street Fighter 2 (Fierce Kick, Medium Kick, Weak Kick). What makes Tekken different from other fighting games are the moves, smooth animations and the cinematic movies for each character that is used to beat the game (you also get a new fighter when you beat the game), however that becomes the point of the game, seeing these movies. Each movie unravels part of a mystery (as to why your even playing the game). A person can beat the game in 20 minutes, because each fight only lasts about 20 seconds, so the pace is pretty fast and you don't need experience to beat the game. Unfortunately there is not much noticeably different from Tekken 2."
4,"Good, but not that great","I read a lot of reviews on this game before buying it, so maybe my expectations were a little high. The graphics here are really not that different in quality from X-Men MA2 (actually, the backgrounds in X-Men are more dynamic). The fighting is good here though, and the characters really do have distinct fighting styles that give you quite the challenge in Arcade mode. They also tend to defend themselves more here, so your every kick or punch won't connect like you want it to. If you're buying for a good fighting game, then you shouldn't be disappointed...but if you're buying expecting graphics that are unlike anything you've ever seen before, you may be."
4,4 Stars Is All Its Gonna Get,"Sorry Tekken fans, good graphics, cool characters, but lacking personality. Yes, I know it's stupid to take off one star for personalities, but hey, I paid for this game!!! If you liked Tekken 2 without the personalities too, I recommend buying this with Tekken 2."
4,SO TOTALLY AWESOME!!!,"Tekken 3 was the first PS game I played, and I loved it! That was one of the only games I could play. Even my friends catch on to that game fast. Even though it was the first PS game I played it's still one of my favorites!"
3,"Good, but has heavy faults","This game in my opinion, is'nt so bad, but it has flaws. This game unlike many others is slow-paced, you move very slowly. Also in this game there are many combos but, they are hard to pull off correctly. Most people just keep pushing one button. Yes this game still does have intresting charcters, but not enough. I like the diffrent modes though. Which is a plus +. This games other faults are that there are no codes for it, and the game gets old fast. I'm not a person that uses cheat codes that much but many other people do. I suggest if you want a good fast-paced fighting game get Marvel vs. Capcom or one of My favorites Bloody Roar 2"
4,Lessons from ordinary people,"This is the first book on investing that I have ever read that showcases the experiences and lessons from ordinary people. This book is organized so that it teaches readers about investing and at the same time provides direct quotes from ordinary people. For example, a heading ""How Much Is Enough?"" explains to readers that it is important to estimate the future costs of food, housing, and other expenses. One of the quotes from this section is:""My goal was to be able to retire at age 55 if I wanted to, at about the same income per year that I was making at age 55. I kept annuity-type charts to assess progress.""- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
4,Good for beginners ..... to instill confidence,I read through the book quickly highlighting sections for my 30-ish children to read when I pass it to them in the next few weeks.One must keep in mind that there is a bias towards index investing.
1,A waste of money for non-newcomers to the net.,Netspy does not provide anything that is noteasily available through various search engines.
3,Used this for my MNN certification review and passed!,I prepared for the RNC-MNN exam using this book. Very detailed and easy-to-read. The chapter questions in the back of the book were very helpful to me.
2,Destined for the back of a drawer,"I found the armband to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. I think the upper arm is just a bad place to carry an iPod. The added weight is distracting when I'm running. Even worse is any activity that requires me to flex my biceps at all, so lifting weights is out. Put it on too tight, and I constrict the muscle. Loosen it a little, and the band slips off. There is no happy medium. Also, the earphone cord gets in the way more when it's leading from my arm.The belt clip that came with my iPod mini works much better for me. I clip it on the waistband of my sweatpants when I'm working out and it remains very secure, even when I'm running on the treadmill. And the cord stays close to my body, where it is far less likely to get caught on something.The only advantage of this product is that it lets you advertise to the world that you own an iPod mini. Big deal. My armband is destined to be forgotten in the back of a drawer at home."
4,"Nice, but expensive.","I found the armband very convienient and comfortable. I even threw it in the wash a couple times (note: I have a front loading wash machine--gentler on clothes.) It compliments the Ipod very nicely and slides onto the Ipod very slick-like. As other have mentioned, it is pricey. That's why I gave it 4 stars."
3,It's just OK!,"The wooden box is a nice little storage box, however, the stainless steel rods for rifle/pistols are very light weight and flimsy. When screwed together they are still wobbly. Brushes and mops are ok."
1,"If the ""WASHABLE"" one stain these must be really HORRIBLE","THE ""washable"" do.a.dot products stain. One can only imagine how badly these must stain since they claim NOT to be very washable. I would be very wary."
4,Kerr-ing Favor,"This was the first Philip Kerr novel I've read and based on other reviews, if it does not live up to the Berlin Noir series, I am excited to read them. I thought Hitler's Peace was a more than a decent WW II novel with very effective use of events both ""here"" and ""there"". The alternate version of who was looking for what amongst the Big Three was plausable as well, in my opinion. Lastly, I am always impressed when an author can pull off first and third person naratives in the same book; I thought it was very effective."
4,Not Bernie Gunther,"Yes, I too am a big fan of the Bernie Gunther series. This is my first book by Phillip Kerr that does not feature Bernie, and, well, I missed him. Kerr's strength is bringing us back to Nazi Germany and creating a credible field for his characters to act upon. He does that well here, too, but I think just a bit much is going on. The whole plot involving General Schellenberg could have been eliminated and none for the worse. That the book gets a bit preposterous in Teheran (author's spelling) is probably where many readers were disappointed. I know that I was. But, I am not deterred. Bernie is welcome back, and lucky for me, I have not yet gotten to the Berlin Trilogy."
2,Rather Absurd,"The first two-thirds of the book are well-constructed and well-plotted. But after that it descends in an arc through the improbable (e.g., the main character conveniently bends over just in time for the bullet meant for him to miss and kill someone else) to the absurd: Adolf Hitler comes to the 1943 Tehran summit to meet with the Big Three.I read sometime ago in the New Yorker that publishing houses no longer give their editors time to work with authors to improve their work. I believe it.Two stars instead of one only because the earlier part of the book is so well done."
4,Very different for Pike's taste.,"Spellbound was a very different book to read my Mr. Pike, if you've read enough of his works to see how he usually goes. This involved the supernatural, and the plot is just a tad far-fetched. Although, I must say it was kind of complicated. The length is average, a bit more than 200 pages, and you'll really appreciate it if you sit and read his other works of fiction."
2,overheating after little use,"I share the frustrations of a previous reviewer who had or has the same problem with his 2222UC model. When I had a problem with the cord not rewinding automatically I sent it back to the dealer who sold it and it was fixed. Now, several months past the warranty the vacuum shuts off after 5 minutes no matter what suction setting it is on and then takes 20 minutes to cool down and is operational for the next 5 minutes. No one here in Florida repairs these so I'll do the customer care call center HELL on Monday and see where we go from there. Vacuuming for 5 minutes, resting for 20 minutes, etc is going to get old in a hurry"
2,Disappointing,"I have had this vacuum for about a year.Pros:- Cleans my wood floors (but nothing out of the ordinary).- Light, easy to carry.Cons:- The canister regularly tips onto its rump, preventing movement. (Looks like it is ""sitting up"" like a dog).- Useless attachments. I really need a round brush attachment.- The cord has never retracted the way I am used to. Any time I want to retract the cord, I have to pull it all the way out first and then let it reel itself back in. It is a real pain.- Expensive as all get out.Update: I would really like to find a round brush attachment for dusting, but I can't seem to find any accessories for this vacuum."
3,Cheap looking,"I expected this to be bigger. It was cheap looking, so I returned it. Looked like a little girl's bag."
5,Wonderful Whimsy,"Told from a hedgehog's unique perspective, this fun story has believable characters and a bit of fanciful day dreaming. Really one of my all time favorite childrens' books. Very much ahead of its time in terms of oversized books that appeal to middle/upper elementary kids. Maps extend the ""play"" potential of the story immensely and really reinforce Victorian gardening concepts. Miss Jaster is herself an interesting character worthy of a bit of dialog."
4,So love this,"My daughter is 3 and has always loved tooling around on my husband's set. We got this for her last Christmas and she adores it. Just like a proper drum kit only smaller, she has so much fun!"
3,"Good paintings, but not sumi-e","This book might be interesting as some artistic approach to make paintings. the paintings are not bad. But they are not sumi-e. They are rather aquarelle, that mimics eastern paintings.IMHO the key thing, that makes Yolanda paintings look different is her technique of brushstokes, which are very typical to the western aquarelle school. The original sumi-e brushstrokes are based on brushstokes of chinese (well, and japanese as well) calligraphy, and this is one of the characteristics that variate paintings of differnt masters.Still, the book text is a good transcription of sumi-e/brush painting concept. Just for the painting examples I'd suggest to look at the works of the ""original"" artists."
5,"A wonderful outline, should be used as a text","This book should be used as a text book. It is clear, easy to read and full of information. Extremely entertaining and flows from chapter to chapter. Opening up questions and answering others, this book is one of the best general history books I have ever read.Mr Van Doren has done an outstanding job of condensing and presenting a general history of knowledge with much knowledge and ability.I noted that while I was reading this book in the summer of 1996 at sidewalk cafes, that on more than one occasion, people walking by would stop and tell me how much they enjoyed the book."
4,Excellent Book.,This is a well written book by a true authority. Van Doren has pointed out some of the more important insights of western knowledge. I say western knowledge considering that is all he really covers. That is also why I didn't award the book five stars. Yet for someone to say that the information within doesn't apply would be stupid; the book is completely applicable.Bottom line is: if you want to get a good grasp on important concepts throughout western history this is the book to get. You'll learn many new things and probably understand the things you already know even better than before.
3,Not bad for a first effort,"I was intrigued by the reviews of this novel when it appeared on my recommended list. So much so that I immediately ordered it. The first half was wonderful. I was completely drawn into the plot and could indeed identify with the characters. Some of the ideas presented were interesting and original, and the style reminded me of the wonderful Iain Banks. Some of the ideas were not original however, with a Dan O'Bannon influence clearly showing through (the ""frozen"" captain for instance).Then everything changed just at the time when it should all have pulled together. It felt as if all those disparate little pieces of plot which had been happily floating around were grabbed and forced into the rather unsatisfactory ending. It was almost as if Mr. Reyolds couldn't really decide how the thing was to end, and just lost a lot of interest.Definately a book of two halves. I will watch out for the next offering."
3,ponderous,"This book was about 200 pages too long. Although the blurb talks about a threat endangering all humanity, I was about 350 pages into the story before any evidence of this threat even began to show. I'd have preferred a bit less ""epic"" and a bit more tension. In addition, the three main characters have essentially the same personality. There was very little in their characterization to differentiate them from one another. I really had to force myself to finish, and the climactic final scene was kind of a let-down. Sorry. I really did want to like this book more."
5,one of the best sf novels ever,cant believe some of the bad reviews on this one! It does take a little time to get into but once you are there it is completely amazing. the nostalgia for infinity is one of sf's best star ships of all times and I think the characters are quite amazing. a classic work and a fine job for the first novel.
1,I hate,every character in this book. What a bunch of @55h0les. Forced my way through it at the beach then sold it back to the place I bought it from (thankfully used). I'll not be trying any more of this author's works.
2,So so,"I read the first 20 pages or so before I could not bear through it any longer. Reading afterward on Wikipedia a summary of the book and of the larger Revelation Space universe just confirmed that the book would not be worth reading.The plot is goofy and unrealistic, from the small details to the big picture (the motivation of the Inhibitors for wiping out all civilizations). Characters are wooden, dialog is awful, plot is wobbly. In short, there are better books out there for SF lovers (try Iain Banks or Vernor Vinge, for example)."
1,Dont bother,"This book was probably the worst book I have ever read. It jumps from one time frame to another with no apparent order. There are so many flashbacks, it becomes very confusing. It offers you glimpses into explaining the story but never actually achieves it. When you finish reading it, you are left wondering what it was all about. It promised so much and delivered so very little."
2,Struggling to finish,"This is another sci-fi book that I bought because the Amazon reviews were excellent.Unfortunately, I am 200 pages into it after 2-3 months of working on it. It just doesn't beg me to pick it up the way some books do. It's sitting on the edge of my desk right now piled under 2-weeks of bills and junkmail. It's only on my desk because my wife brought it in from the kitchen when she was picking up.I feel obligated to finish it and figure out what's going on, but it's almost like chinese water torture. There's so much stuff in it that doesn't contribute to the story and, after 200 pages, I don't feel like it's progressing towards a conclusion.The biggest problem I have with books like these is the excessive technobabble and jumping back and forth between timelines, ships, locations, and even characters. So at this point, I don't even know who the main character is, or if there is a main character."
4,Terrific. Until the ending...,"The story starts a little slowly, but as the various plot lines and characters begin their collision course towards each other the tension builds inexorably. The story is heavy on science, backing off just before your eyes start to glaze over and thus keeping the pacing and your interest. The story elements, characters, and world created are incredible, interesting, and make you crave more.Then in the last hundred pages or so everything just sort of wraps up with a ""Well, I guess everything's okay,"" and some characters suddenly reveal they've learned all the intricacies of the plot and recite them aloud.Very unsatisfying end to a riveting story."
1,Bad soundtrack,"Denise Austin is excellent, it is too bad we can't hear what she is saying. Because of the wind, waves crashing and too loud music she is inaudible. From other tapes I have of her, she gives good tips just when you need them, on this one it is impossible.I have to turn the audio off in order to concentrate the noise is so bad. It is too bad. Otherwise a good workout but I would not reccommend it."
1,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed with this video, for a number of reasons. First of all, Denise is standing near the ocean, which makes for a nice view, but the noise of the waves seriously interfered with the sound quality -- at times I couldn't even hear her! Also, I found the choreography to be far too intricate for a beginner. It was nearly impossible for me to keep up (granted, I'm no Ginger Rogers). And last but not least: Denise looks great, but it would have been nice to have some other people there . . . maybe even some with more ""average"" bodies."
5,A Nice Patriotic Watch,"I have always enjoyed the Fossil watches that I have owned, and this one is no exception. The wrist band seems durable and the face has the usual Fossil quality and styling.Others who have reviewed this blue banded as well as the brown banded version have noted that the flag is backwards. It is not. On all time pieces, the ""12"" is the top of the face. Do any search on flag etiquette and you will note that when a flag is hung instead of flown (draped from a ceiling vs. flown on a flagpole) the stars are in the upper left. Even when flown on a pole the stars are in the upper left. The face of this watch holds to the standards of flag etiquette since the ""12"" is the top of the face of the watch and the orientation of the flag would be as is the flag was being draped."
4,Fun Game...Easy to transport!!,My kids love this game. It's an easy game to take with them when they will have time to kill. I'd much rather see them play this game with each other or a friend than a video game like Gameboy. They actually talk and laugh together and it's fun to see them figure out which card they can play. I'd highly recommend it as a game-on-the-go!
5,Pilot Pen,"Great pen, very solid workhorse. Writing tip is excellent. I am a pen guru and this pen is incredible!"
4,"Some people can't enjoy, but other can enjoy","I listened to this album for the first time, I was very disappointed at it. But I listened to it again and again, I found it was very interesting and wonderful. Her voice is so unique that some people don't like it. But I think this one is a good CD for those who don't know about opera because there are many essential arias for coloratura by Mozart."
4,Highly Reccomended,"Personally, I like Natalie Dessay's voice the most out of all the singers I've listened to in many styles. I guess some people think it is too thin, but that is what I like about it. From what I hear it is the perfect strength/depth. What I like is that she doesn't sound exactly like all the others. Renee Fleming and others have a quality of deepness that I don't enjoy as much as Natalie's pure pitch. I can really hear each individual clear note or sound, and there is no muffled undertone!"
3,It failed again(??????),"I thought it was hilarious about previous reviwer's headline(It failed). Well, actually she seemed to recovered from past terrible CDs. I have to say this new CD is her best so far. I enjoyed most of pieces except Queen of the night Arias(repeating again from Erato recording. so boring). Otherwise, this is a decent CD if you like light voice. In terms of Mozart aria CD, I perfer ""Kathleen Battle or Sumi Jo or even Kiri"". I do recommend you to listen this CD before you buy since Dessay's voice can be annoying if you are not familiar with operatic tunes."
5,Perfect name for a perfect product,"No problem with this order. My dog is VERY happy...and is 'yip yappin' all the time for one!!! All I have to do is shake the tin, and he will come running, and do anything I want him to do!"
3,Whisk life's problems away with this delightful dwarf whisk,"My fairly ridiculous diet consists of eggs, lunchmeat and chicken breasts. The only way I like my eggs is scrambled. Scrambling eggs with a fork gets old and wastes a fork. Why not waste a whisk, instead?So I bought this little tiny whisk and it's treated me quite well for its purposes of whisking and mixing eggs.That said, don't leave your whisk in a bowl of water in the sink or it will develop rust. My whisk has some unseemly rust spots along the top of the springy part so we don't want to bring this whisk out when Martha Stewart comes to visit. She'd gasp in horror!"
3,Favorite Filter Brand,"I like Fram filters and this particular model is difficult to find locally. Good price at amazon.com. Having said that, don't be mislead by the generic picture as it does not have the grip feature. Also, made in China."
5,Battery wrap,Arrived on time and as described. Waiting to replace my battery and will install it then. Looks like it will work just fine.
3,if it only worked right...,"Well, let's start off with the good stuff: 1.great graphics 2.a lot of cars 3. downloadable cars from needforspeed.com 4.good gameplay and interface and now the bad: 1. you have to earn cars and tracks 2. the games system requirements are deceptive. our computer is almost double what it should be, but the game will only let us play one or two races before it crashes."
5,Best from the Need For Speed series,"This game rocks. It is the best game in the NFS series. I bought the PSX version the day it hit store shelves. I now have the PC version as well. I breifly got a chance to try the playstation version of NFS5: Porsche Unleashed, but I like this on better, partly because the game is about one manufacturer: Porsche. In this game, you can choose to drive with the top up or down on cars that are so equipped. The hot Pursuit mode is hotter than ever with thre different game mode within Hot Puruit. Plus there are extra cars available from the NFS website. Any diehard race fan should get this game now."
3,Not Terrible...,"Make sure you get the right book!! The original copy that came had a cover for Juggling Chainsaws, but the book inside was a different Navpress publication.Once I received the correct book it was so-so. Some chapters did a great job o leading you through the topic, others never seemed to get anywhere. I also am disappointed in the books exclusive use of the Message Bible Translation, though you can obviously use your own..."
3,"Expectations not met, but...","Not what I thought it was going to be. It's ""glittery"" looking and it kinda itches. I also thought it was going to be made out of spandex, but instead it's like cotton or some other fluffly-soft material. But whatev... it served its purpose for Halloween. LOL"
3,News about this DVD,"""Hooray For Thomas"" will be on DVD and Video January 25th.Narrator: Michael BrandonStories:Hooray For ThomasThe Grand OpeningBest Dressed EngineRheneas & The Roller CoasterEdward's Brass BandThe Refreshement Lady's StandSong: Rules & Regulations"
2,"Ugh...Keith Code is tedious, but his info is useful","If you ride and want to better understand your riding and your motorcycle, this is a useful book. But be warned that Keith Code can be a bit tedious in his writing style, often 'defining' words you don't need defined. His info is good. His delivery could be better."
4,Twist of the Wrist II,This is truly a good book for all motorcyclists but it is aimed particularly at the guys who want to go to the track. It does a good job of explaining the reasons why so many motorcyclists are unable to master some of the techniques required to avoid crashing. The book is pretty easy to read and a great thought stimulator for those seeking to understand the why's and why nots. There are also several excersizes detailed to try and train your mind not to do some of the things which although intuitive are bad riding habits.
2,twist of the wrist 1 & 2,These books are great for the pro rider. To wordy for a regular rider.While counter steering is covered for track riding it does little for the street rider. It could cover cornering at low speed and turning a slow 90 degree turn. Turning on hills and the timing in a corner or turn at the street level. For the regular rider I would give these books a ' D '.
5,Source on the basics of cornering motorcycles,"This book is the BEST book on the basics of what is actually important when it comes to cornering motorcycles.All of us motorcycle riders and racers can go straight on a motorcycle, but what happens when you get to that corner is what most motorcycle riders REALLY care about.Keith obviously took the time to really look at exactly what was happening when a person goes to turn a motorcycle into a corner. Knowing what controls to use when and what to do with your eyes is to me the best things I got out of reading this book.this is trueStoney Landers"
4,"Be Safer, Go Faster","Ignore all those other reviews that whine (whinge in the UK) about the writing style ... who cares ... just ignore the little *'s and skip the footnotes. This book is primarily written for racers, but there's lots of worthwhile info on riding technique for street riders. For new streebikers, ""Sportbiking: The Real World"" is a better introduction to proper technique, but I still learned something from this book. ""Real World"" filled-in gaps in my basic riding style, but Twist of the Wrist II helped make me safer (avoiding ""survival responses"") and much faster through the corners (pivoting on the outside peg)."
2,Looking for Street Riding? Go read Hough,"Twist of the Wrist is a great book...for track racing. The street-applicable skills are buried in discussion of track-specific performance training.As a novice motorcyclist, I bought Twist of the Wrist and Proficient Motorcyling at approximately the same time, and found Proficient Motorcycling to be much more useful. That book takes all the useful street skills that you'll find in Twist the Wrist, then adds reams of additional street riding content, including wet/icy weather riding, judging corners, avoiding lane-straddling cars, how to set your shocks for load, riding gear essentials, correct braking, what to do when you see a deer, etc. Do yourself a big favor, go pick it up and wait for Twist the Wrist until you are planning to take your bike to the track. That's when Twist becomes useful."
3,Quirkish,"I loved everything that was written about the main character's life, especially his attempts at a social life and how other people reacted to him. Evans has a strong grasp on his utterly disfunctional family and everything that happened inside Steward's home felt very real -- and very awful. I can't recall a character that I've disliked as intensely as I disliked his father.As for the mystery/thriller that the book revolves around... it was unfortunately pretty weak and not at all interesting. I wound up skimming the parts related to the boring, utterly stock ""bad guys"", eager to get back to Steward's life."
2,Too dark for me!,"I have to admit that the story idea was an original, but it just didn't work for me. Firstly, the story was too creepy and too dark. I found it rather disturbing that a morgue attendant would become so obsessed with a dead woman. Secondly, Stewart, the main character, was so abnormal I had a terrible time maintaining interest in him. I know that he was not supposed to be the smartest man in the world, but some of the messes he got himself into were completely unbelievable. I can't imagine anyone actually acting on the plans that Stewart comes up with. I can't go into details about the ending without giving anything away but, believe me, it was terrible. Unless you have a great deal of time on your hands, I wouldn't recommend you read this book."
4,fortress,fortress was a good B movie I would say 3.5 out of 5 stars how they get captured is different where they are taken is weird they like to escape I liked the idea of the masks and how they look the movie keeps you going and the ending is very good surprise
1,Misleading,This was suppose to be a gift for my daughters birthday. It was very misleading in the description. It never stated it was a mini camera small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. I returned the product and it cost me more in the long run.
4,A good book by a humble author,"This is a book for everybody. I was also greatly impressed by the fact that I took the liberty of sending an email to the author at his web page and received an polite, helpful answer to my question."
5,A wonderful little book after a long cold winter!,"We found this book ...just as the daffodils and forsythia were starting to flower. My 3 yr old sons and I went on a treasure hunt for more signs of spring, without much luck. A couple weeks later, as the weather warmed, we tried again. This time, we pretended to be the characters in the book, Lucy, Henry and Zack. Like Lucy, I definitely get spring fever, so I was thrilled to lead them in their search for flower buds on trees and bushes, feathers, new grass, moss, and dandelion flowers.""Signs of Spring"" is a beautifully illustrated book, with forest animals as the main characters. It is a perfect introduction to spring and the changes occuring in nature for preschool age children. For the young elementary child, it might inspire a perfect show and tell presentation. And for everyone, it is a welcome reminder that no matter how long and dark and cold winter seems, the bright and fresh wonders of spring will always appear!"
4,Movie Great - Flexplay Not so much,"Since everyone who has gone before has pretty much summed up the Cons of Flexplay (in case there are Pros - sorry, do not see them) I'll concentrate on the movie.Noel is an excellent film in my humble opinion. The cast is fantastic and the storyline, although quite weird and unexpected at times turns out to be a lovely Christmas story about love and forgiveness. Definitely possibilities to turn into a Christmas Classic. Just don't know why it was never released in major theaters.And hopefully it will grow up and be a true DVD, since I would like some specials and I WANT TO REWATCH IT! Flex is a RIPOFF! Sorry."
5,"A 'Slice of life"", Christmas drama.","An utterly charming, and dramatic Christmas story that delves into the real life issues that affect so many people during the holiday season.The acting is superb, and enhances an already intriguing story premise that follows the lives of realistic characters trying to deal with the issues in their lives during the hard, cold, stark reality of the Christmas season. Definitely a film that will have meaning to a lot of People. Have a few Kleenex at hand....."
3,Noel,"A good movie to watch at Christmas time but it is a bit depressing. Great cast, Suasan Sarandon (sp?), Penelope Cruz and Robin Williams."
3,"Planes, Trains and What about just downloading?",I guess one application for Flexplay would be in airports where they can be viewed while waiting or on a personal player while inflight. I am not sure what Flexplay offers over the other technology that seems to be (trying to get) around the corner--downloading movies that also expire in certain time frame.
1,Wonderful movie!!!,"I watched the movie on TNT and simply loved it. A very heart warming movie that made me cry! I thought it would be shown again on TNT, but I don't think it will be. I wanted to see it again with my boyfriend and had told other friends about it. I would love to buy the DVD, but do not like the idea of FlexPlay -- having to watch it within 48 hrs. of opening it. I'd prefer to pay the extra money to buy the regular DVD to own and share with friends and family. Or I'd rent it locally and not pay shipping on a DVD that's going to ""die"" in 48 hours!"
1,"Ok, as long as it sticks","which isn't too long. In fact, only about 200 miles or so. After 36 hours of setting up the adhesive (and I am in the adhesives business!) it should have been ready to use. Driving down the hiway I heard a clatter and clunk and, poof, gone.I see it went from $[...] bucks at Amazon to $[...] thru a market place seller. But even for a saw buck it is expensive if it flies off the car.To Amazon's credit, they of course took it (the remaining parts) back. But strike against Midland, who wasn't there for 3100 miles of my trip due to poor engineering and design."
3,Antenna,"This antenna works OK, but only if you need short range communications.My main complaint is with the company that resells this product. Because they have no idea what radio antennas are, I was shipped the incorrect antenna. After a few emails explaining my problem, I was assured I would be refunded my shipping costs of the wrong product back to the company. I was never credited with that cost.I would suggest you find another company that is more ethical in their business practices."
3,Good but Outdated,"While still being sold as new, this book is going on 7 years old. Quantum leaps have been made in equipment technology that are not reflected in the prose--either teaching or equipment. Also, a third of the book is devoted to ski areas, but the information is badly outdated. Most areas have added new runs and modernized lift systems. And rates, well...I skied Breckenridge April 3 for $65 a day. Adult rate is listed at $47 in the book. Booksellers should demand updates."
1,Come on!,"They say it is soo easy to dock the Ipod mini. WRONG! My Ipod mini got scratched, so thats when I decided to put the skintight cover on, to cover it up. Then I got a regular Ipod dock, and thanks to the cover my Ipod mini fit perfectly, and not only was it cheaper, I got the same things that the mini dock could do."
2,No Cables !!! (useless?),"HiI ordered this along with my Ipod Mini (which is back ordered), I'm very suprised and disapointed that this is just a little piece of plastic with 2 connectors: I was (wrongly...) assuming that ordering this meant I could have 1 connection at work and another at home... it is actually not useful on its own..."
3,needs more power,"First some PROS* nice small form factor* the 4 different blades all work well* blade shaft holds well in power body, Do not slip* Stores and travels easily.CONS* very underpowered, unless your mixing sugar water. But what do expect from 2 AA batteries.>> but with some persistence and time you can mix thicker powders/liquids by letting it spin up while slightly submerged and then going deeper, let it slow, pull back and repeat. !! can make a mess !!* Power (on/off) lever can be hard to depress and tiring to hold down.* blades can be hard to remove.All in all it works well for light mixing"
3,Lite duty only,"This is a very handed item, it has help me tremendously. I suffered a stroke and now only have the use of one hand. This item is great for mixing or stirring liquids of any lite duty jobs. The only thing that it didn't acheive for me was mixing pancake mix. But it's a lot more powerful than it looks!"
2,poorly made knock off,A little girl toy is the best I can say. Poor quality and no power for common kitchen tasks associated with mixers.
3,mini mixer,"sorry i did not read the word ""mini"" in the description of the item it works well for small drinks but i was looking more for a big drink mixer so my fault"
3,Nor pro cordless mini mixer,"Because there was no accurate description of this product, I was not knowing what to expect. This item was tiny, all plastic, battery operated. Almost beyond impossible to load batteries. With much trial and error, finally achieved this task. Does not turn on without considerable effort. WHEN you get it to work, it is better than hand mixing."
5,Portable and Wonderful,"I use to mix eggs for making omlete, use to mix curd to make buttermilk out of it. Easy to clean. Simple, portable, easy to use."
5,good and cheap,"This product is great. It's so many products in one and it's it's very inexpensive. Most other mixers/frothers die on me in a month, but this one is still going."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"I had a mini single hand mixer. I purchased this to replace that one. However, I didn't realize just how mini this one was until I received it. It's good for mixing drinks, but that's about all the power it has, and it's too short to mix drinks in deep glasses. Hopefully I can find what I'm looking for, in the meantime, I have a new drink stirrer."
5,"Cute, works as intended","This mixer works great. I use it for mixing protein drinks as well as things like homemade dressings and marinades, hot chocolate, etc.. Obviously it's not meant for mixing thick batters, so don't buy it for that. I haven't quite figured out what the differences are between the attachments because they all seem to work the same for my purposes. Can't wait until I turn 21 next week and can start using it for alcohol"
5,Great gadget,"This is so handy and strong. I like the portability. I use it for gravy, hot chocolate, mixing any powdered drink, and anything I need to get lumps out. I love the versatility. It arrived quickly. Great job Amazon!"
3,ok for the price.. break easy,"it works well for the price but the knob contact is really bad. After using for a few times, it very hard to press and there are only certain angle that will kick the motor to turn."
1,Foam no more,I received the Norpro mixer on July 13th and yesterday July 28th it stopped working. I guess I wasn't really expecting much due to the price. Thats why i'm not too upset. Buy with caution.
3,Worked Great for about 1 month!,I used this mixer to mix my protein shakes for about a month before it stopped working!
1,Awful - No stars,"Flimsy. Cheaply made. Have to hold your finger down on the piece of plastic (which is also the ""door"" for the batteries) to operate. Not worth any price if it is aggravating. Returned as soon as received. No stars (wouldn't publish unless I gave it at least one)."
1,Worthless Mini Mixer,"I bought this mixer to mix baby formula. The mixer started failing after a month and is basically completely dead now (and it's not the batteries). The design of this thing requires that you push on a cheap piece of plastic to press down a little bit of metal until it makes the connection and turns the mixer on, which often didn't work. When it does work, the heat goes through the thin piece of plastic in seconds and is hot enough to burn your skin. Please don't waste your money on this."
1,Very very small. (disappointed in product),"This item is very small. It is hard to tell from the photo. It runs on a battery, but does not have enough power to stir anything except maybe chocolate milk. I was wanting it for yogurt, but it doesn't have enough power to stir it. Would not recommend this product!Shipping was fast!"
2,Overwrought,"That's funny. I thought Marxism was dead, or at least unfashionable. But it appears to be alive and well in academia."
1,There must be better books on solar electricity,"This book will leave you wanting. Wanting to stay on the grid! ... It lacks a lot but most of all it lacks Pictures, Illustrations, something to help visualize how to do what the author is talking about. Pick up any ""how to"" mannuel. What is it filled with? Pictures, Illustrations. This book has 3 maybe 4. Besides that, it is poorly written.The book is also, shall we say , ""lacking in value"". If you get my meaning. I have never done a review before but from the review guidelines, I assume amazon will not allow me to be any more blunt than that. Of course if you have money to burn you could use it for your wood store to fire your boiler to produce steam in your own personal turbine. Now there's a idea. Someone should write a book about it."
1,Warning about this one,"This may be an isolated incident, but just in case...We bought this card and it did not work properly. The computer seemed to recognize the card without problems, but the USB ports would not recognize the devices we plugged into it. We tried a 1GB USB flash drive and our digital camera, both of which work well with the old (slower) USB drives. Whenever we tried to use the ports, the computer (which runs on Windows XP) would freeze up. Our problem is not listed in the (very short) user manual troubleshooting guide. Their website is disappointing and we're not in the mood for waiting for customer service, so we're returning ours.Again, this may very well be an isolated incident. Good luck with your card."
3,don't last long,Seems to me the outer cover should have lasted a bit longer than a ouple of uses. I try the second one soon.
2,"Clever concept, poor workmanship","The combination of a terry towel and a sponge is genius because you get the uniform pressure of a sponge with the softness of a terry towel. I used the applicators one time, then washed them in the washing machine as directed, and one of applicators came apart at the seams."
5,It works!,"This book provides the reader with a very simple, effective way to lose weight. With the Be Skinny Fast (BSF) monikor, it is easy to remember...Skip the Bread, Skip the Sugar, and Skip the Fried Foods! It is that easy.The author also provides a lot of recipes for the reader to use in place of eating bread, sugars and fried foods. He mixes in a good amount of humor to keep the pacing going.The book is a quick read with applicable strategies for losing weight. No special foods or diet drinks. Just common sense strategies for losing weight.Pick it up!"
4,More Strong Work from Cameron,"I enjoyed this novel. It contained Cameron's typical blend of melancholy, travel, intelligent dialogue, and characters searching for meaning in their lives.I was disappointed the movie didn't get more attention."
2,Poor Dick!,"I read this book because Ira Glass (This American Life - NPR) featured the story on one of his shows. The feature was wonderful, mostly because Glass told the story with a straight face. When I listened to the show, I thought that there are things you can intellectualize a little too much--and this is one of them. Poor Dick! It's obvious that Chris Kraus is an exhibitionist who married Sylvere for his accent. ...and she's like a junior high school kid who is saying ""LOOK AT ME."" She is pathetic and sick and WHO CARES about the garbage she's writing to Dick. OK, so she wants to be an intellectual. Tell someone who cares. I suppose the book would be interesting to mental health professionals. The only payoff in the book was the letter that Dick writes to Sylvere."
4,both engaging and a little annoying,"Although it bogs down some in the middle, overall this is a fascinating/infuriating/perplexing/upsetting view into Chris Kraus's mind. The books worked least for me when Kraus's sense of inferiority was most palpable, because then she comes across most (as one of the other reviewers points out) as a desperate, pathetic woman who you really don't want to be reading about, but on the whole, i found it a deeply engaging, well-written, very honest look at the not very uncommon phenomena of obsession and fastasy."
2,Not Very Useful For Our Purposes,"This book might be more useful with a higher kidney function, but we bought the book with less than 20% function, and most of the recipes include low sodium soy sauce and parmesan cheese, and we have to keep sodium levels too low for that, so I really couldn't use any of the recipes."
4,An interesting perspective on war.........,"I stumbled upon this novel accidentally while I was reading reviews here on Amazon, one of my favorite sources of good ""unknowns."" This story revolves around a POW camp for German prisoners in the southern U.S. during WWII, but the title really doesn't refer to these foreigners at all. Instead, the ""prisoners"" are the just-back-from-the-battlefield American soldier who's having difficulty keeping it together, the eager seventeen year old high school boy who isn't allowed to enlist until his 18th birthday, the boy's late father who committed suicide after struggling with his own WWI memories, the African American teenager who's evading the draft because he doesn't want to fight the white man's war, etc. An interesting way to look at war, neither pacifist nor militarist, just the story of how people's lives are impacted by conflict. Mr. Yarbrough's prose has a rhythm that takes a little getting used to, but ultimately a very satisfying read here."
3,Zack! Zack! Zack!,"As usual, this anthology runs from the sublime to the ugly. But it's got Zack, and his ""Message to the Emperor"" is worth the price of the book all by itself. It's a wild, non-stop tour through ancient Roman male-male excess: witty, unbridled, and drawn with the author's almost incredible eye for detail -- sexual and otherwise. Zack doesn't cheat the reader in any way; his story takes in threesomes, gang-bangs, underwater couplings, romantic two-handers, tantalizing hints of sado-masochistic ritual, and the most astoundingly drawn orgy sequence you've ever seen -- topped by a deliciously erotic surprise ending. If Zack's entry doesn't do it for you, you may be dead from the waist down. Once again: when do we get an entire book of Zack, Zack, and nothing but Zack?"
1,Pinnacle 9 Plus does not work,"I have read so many reviews and everyone has the same problem I have. THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT RENDER PAST 10 MINUTES. There must be thousands of people who have been scammed into buying this software and a couple of upgrades. Isn't anyone a lawyer who is willing to start a class action law suit! I have over 80 hours into a vacation DVD that is useless. My only regret (besides buying it) is my DVD burning test was less than 10 minutes to make sure it worked. The ""S"" on my chest is for Sucker!"
2,Quantity VS Quality Action,Lots of fighting and explosions here but everything moves a little too fast (undercranking) and the story is nothing special. The DVD is also pretty weak. Donnie Yen fans will probably dig it.
1,Bad making and poor customer server,"The card failed two months after purchase. I requested a RMA and returned the card. After no news in the first month, I started to inquire in emails. No reply. I wrote several more emails. No answer. I called the customer support number on their website. No way to reach a tech support in the system and even no choice given to leave a message. I tried their tech support forum. No way I could log in.I finally found a good phone number at the end of the second month and someone answered. The guy said will try. Well this is the end of the third month. Nothing.I would never go anywhere close to a visiontek product again."
2,A mess after 3 months,"This cover seemed like the best solution for me...thin, full protection, belt clip. I was good for a month or so, then it began to be bothersome. Dust would easily accumulate under the clear portion of the cover and I would have to slip my finger under it to wipe it clean all the time.And, the top would sag when I opened the phone so that when I took photos, I would have to make sure it was flat, or my pictures would have portions of the cover blocking it.Later, I noticed that the cover worked loose the rubber plugs on the phone that keep it from slamming shut, metal to metal. Pretty soon, the plugs were gone.Finally, after about 4 1/2 months, the seams where clear plastic meets leather began to show wear and pull apart.I didn't abuse this cover at all! Overall, I would say, don't expect this cover to last on your rzr for very long."
4,battleship model,Bought this model for my 11 year old grandson. He had fun building it. Not too difficult. It is an accurate replica.
1,I don't like it.,This is very poor quality. Just about every single part needs trimming. Also to many items on the deck made it hard to get a nice wood paint job. Items are too small to mask off. Bigger items do not line up correctly. Assembled most of it with super glue so parts would not shift during dry time. Sorry I purchased it.
2,Cheap no directions,It was cheap and came with no directions for assembly lots of tiny pieces i would not recommend this product
2,There's better out there,"The book itself isn't that bad. It is a good high level tutorial without too much detail. However, if you want a tutorial and reference that is more up to date I'd recommend checking out The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference. It was recently published and covers a broader scope (the whole standard library, not just the STL)."
1,Already broken,"We live in bush Alaska so we need things that are sturdy and dependable. Now we know why this product is discounted so heavily. Within two weeks, three of the table knives have ""broken""--the blade has pulled out of the handle. The rest is OK and actually pretty good for the price. Unfortunately, the neat wooden tray that comes with it won't fit into any of our kitchen drawers.All in all--a dud."
4,¿Usted lo sabe todo sobre el dinero?,"Sólo los necios podrían expresarse de esa manera. El libro enseña trucos y secretos básicos para estirar el presupuesto familiar y alcanzar ciertas metas y objetivos financieros. Su planteamiento central es sencillo y válido: como consejero de finanzas personales, yo lo recomiento. Sugiere un estilo de vida frugal, disciplina y auto-control. Como era de esperar, la mayoría de lectores no lo ponen en práctica por la sencilla razon de que les resulta difícil cambiar patrones de gasto firmemente grabados en su subconsciente. Esta problema no es fácil de solucionar y tampoco se discute en el texto. Aun así, su lectura constituye un primer paso en la escalera del éxito financiero."
4,Happy with quality,"I ordered a set of 50 for my small dogs. They are the green ones, they are very absorbant, almost identical to the ones they sell at the drug store (which usually go for twice the cost).The seller shipped with ups, but didn't give me a tracking number.Next time i'll buy the set of 150 for even more savings.I think they should revise the name of the listing ""300/case"" is sorta deceiving."
5,Awesome !,"Cusumano shows us what we, IT professionals, should know about business of software. He also shows us, in a very simple manner, what we must really know about software and its value chain."
4,Recommended,"This is a good book. I recommend it for anyone interested in the software business. When it comes to the software industry, there is a natural tendency to focus on the importance of product, so I particuarly liked the author's emphasis on the importance of management."
3,Cusumano Forgot de Latin Amercia Market,"Cusumano made a very good job to put in order same ideas that the persons who are in the software business have.But the big mistake was to not consider the LA Market. There are no examples of Uruguay, Chile, Argentina Start Up's. This market is growing on and Professor Cusumano no cosider it."
1,really liked this at first,then... after one week it stopped working. do I want to hassle with getting it made right? NO!I really like the features and portability. as stated in advertizing an exteranl antena is needed for anything further than a short distance.
4,Good Value For The Money,"Bought this for my car club drives (Best way to keep in touch with the other drivers). Simple to use, Backlit display is easy to see, Buttons also light up. Nice clear sound. I would recommend an external antenna. Range is only about a mile or so with the included little stubby rubber one. Nice little CB radio. Perfect for my needs. Like it very much."
1,Does not work,"I usually have very favorable reviews, but this unit is poor at best. I wanted to use for motorcycle communication between bikes, but when I tested the unit, it would only work for about 100 yards from one hand held unit to another. I drove down the street, and before I even went 1/10 of a mile the unit stopped working. It only works when literally standing next to each other. The ONLY way the unit barely works is to have connected to external antenna (which is still very limiting). My advice is to just get good GMRS or FRS radios from Midland or some other manufacturer as they work better and are significantly cheaper."
3,Midland 75-820,Nice radios. I bought two. Be aware that the transmit range is VERY short using the antenna provided.
4,nice radio,"I used this radio on 2000 mile 4 day trip on my harley and worked good the whole time, keep in mind though it only has a 4 watt output so range is lacking compaired to the other bikes i was with."
2,2 Units and both have defects,"I purchased this through Amazon. The first one was late and determined lost in shipping. Amazon immediately sent another one overnight one day delivery.It worked great accept for the rechargeable battery transceiver and plug. The plug didn't seem to fit completely into the transceiver, so Amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out 2 day post.That unit has the exact same issue. It will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose. I even went out and bought eight new Radioshack rechargeable AA, cost $38, to make sure it wasn't the batteries. It wasn't.This unit gets NOA crystal clear in my truck as well, but no CB channels get any reception.Instead of shipping this one back to Amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another CB maker, I called Midland Radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug. If that doesn't work it goes back and I will buy elsewhere."
2,"Great idea, poor execution.","Ok, the features list and the configuration make this look like a great product. Functions as either a mobile CB with a very small footprint, or as a handheld, NOAA Weather stations, easy to use. Looks good so far. But, as a radio, it's just plain junk.Range as a handheld with the provided antenna is only around 100ft or so between two identical units, and that's with the squelch control turned off. So an external antenna is mandatory for pretty much any use. Even when you get good reception, the audio quality from the built in speaker is flat and hard to hear.Using it while driving is the worst situation at all, since the radio is severely impacted by ignition noise from your car. Yes, this is something that you have to deal with when using just about any two-way radio, so it's not like a different brand would eliminate the problem, but this unit does not appear to have any built-in filtering to help with the issue."
4,Works for me.....,Pulls in enough conversation (about 5 miles) for what I needed it for as I only wanted it for traveling on major highways. Allows you to hear conversations within five miles either way of your traveling direction. I used the short based Cobra HG A 1000 Base-Load Small Mount 100W CB Antenna for what I needed. I'm sure with a longer antenna I could have gotten better range of conversation.
5,Midland Handheld CB,"I bought this CB for off-roading comms, its very compact and an easily stored unit. Lots of extras, good quality and excellent price!"
4,Works ok when plugged into the power source of vehicle.,"The CB work OK when it was plugged into the RV power. On battery power, couldn't pick-up other folks in our caravan."
5,CB radio,"Works very well, I am a truck driver and needed for call aheads as well as traffic conditions. Satified with product"
2,Product died within 1st 1/2 hour.,"Nice looking, nicely packaged. It worked for a grand total of 1/2 hour. Customer service people very nice and it is in being repaired. I will follow up as soon as it comes back."
3,Nice lil Radio,"I just picked this guy up and have had it a few weeks now. So far its been a lot of fun to play with. I'm new to the whole CB thing so i couldn't possibly compare it to anything else out there but one thing is for sure, you'll need a REALLY good antenna. I bought the cobra whip antenna based on reviews but it really doesn't seem to improve the range...maybe its just the area i'm in. So, i picked up a roof antenna for 10 bucks and it made a big difference. So, bottom line, fun radio, easy to hide in your auto and get a GOOD antenna. If anyone has any recommendations i'd luv to hear from ya!"
2,Didn't feel like it would last.,I bought this and sent it back almost immediately. It felt really flimsy and the battery pack seemed like a toy.
4,Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB-Way Radio,"Great radio. I bought with to be portable. Has the ability to plug in the cig lighter or use batteries. Also can plug in an antenna if you want. Range is short with the stubby, but that is to be expected. Love that is has the scan feature and weather. For the price it's hard to beat."
2,Readers review,"The book contains very interesting photographs. However, it provides very limited information on Calamity Jane herself. Just the basics regarding her life are discussed. I think the book is too expensive for what it is offering."
4,A Great Movie For The Little Ones...,"Well, my kids really enjoy this movie. They can actually sit through the whole movie & they are only 2 & 3 1/2. I don't want to make too many comments for the adults because I'm sure most adults aren't going to buy this just for themselves. I wouldn't recommend that but if you were looking for a movie to please your kids then I'd highly recommend this movie. I think all kids up to the age of 8 or so would enjoy this movie. Basically the story is that this little boy all of a sudden finds that he can hear everything that dogs say. Supposedly there is a planet out there made of up all dogs & Hubble the boy's dog has just been sent from there to grade the dogs on earth. So, like I said this is a movie I'd recommend for kids but adults might think it's a little far-fetched."
4,Children like it,"My children like this story, but it gets a little old for adults. Then again, I've ""seen"" it many. many times!"
3,Cute Movie,entertaining and fast paced. I enjoyed the movie. Loved the cast and the scenery. Recomend for anyone who wishes a light funny show.
2,Cliche,"I'm normally game for these movies but I thought this was pretty terrible. I think it bothered me most that the leading lady behaved terribly through out and almost had no consequences. I know it's a movie and not realistic, but... There has to be some boundaries."
1,boring!!!,Ugh! i love love chick flicks/romantic comedies but this one has to go! no humor....no real chick flick feel...no nothing! don't waste your time.
1,Not what I hoped for,"I was pretty disappointed with this. I enjoyed Mandi Moore in another movie in this past, but this movie felt contrived. The acting wasn't that good either. Overall - not worth the time to watch it."
1,snoozefest zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,tried to hard to b cute and witty and not sure if it was the script or brolin trying to hard to 'act' or moore as a psychologist (about as believable as her being the president of the USA) but gosh it was hard to stay awake. kept fast forwarding till the pain was finally over and the movie also. i'm adding mine with the other 45 atm of 'used' copies to be sold.
5,cell phone battery,"what can you say about a replacement battery? it fits, it holds a charge, its just what i needed."
2,"Bad customer service, item is not working",bad customer servicethe Item isnt workingtried to contact them with no respons.
2,half life normal battery,It has about half the life of the battery that came w/ my razor phone. Says it's the same type and modle #. It's just a back up case something happens anyway.
1,Battery lasted 1 month,"Brought the battery, it lasted about one month and loses it's charge under 24 hours with little or no use. I got taken. Won't be using this company again."
5,Motorola OEM Cell Phone Battery,This is my first order from this company. It was good and fast service. Faster than I expected. Am planning on ordering again from them.
4,Great product,I purchased this battery for an older phone that my wife was using. Very pleased with its performance. The battery lasted several years before being decommissioned.
1,"It is dead after two weeks of using it. I'm sure the seller knew it was a bad batter, but he doesn't care, he's getting paid.","It worked great for almost two weeks, now it's dead and I have to find another one. Needless to say, it won't be from the same seller on Amazon because he sold me a dead battery."
2,Poor performance,"Bought this new battery , charged it and it would not hold a full useful charge as a advertised NEW battery should do.. called for frequent recharges.. must have been on the shelf for many months(years)?"
3,phone battery,"I think its good for the price,only I waited too long and my phone went and I had to buy a new phone."
3,one out of two batteries seemed to be the real thing,"This has been my experience: I bought two batteries. After fully charging the first one, it lasted 2 hours only and then needed to be recharged! That was very disappointing. The reason I bought replacement batteries was because the old battery (which came with the phone 3 years ago) began to last only a couple of hours!). The second battery I had ordered, so far has been lasting 2 and a half days. So this one seems to be the real deal!"
2,Beware of shelf life,Got an education. This type of battery degrades just sitting around. So even though its still in its bubble new and unused it may not hold a charge. They were so cheap that I bought 2 and got 1 good one.
1,BATTERY DOESN'T HOLD A CHARGE,"Well, we didn't want to spend a lot for a new replacement battery for our Motorola ... why do they always seem to die just when the contract on the phone is just about up? This battery is marked Motorola, but it didn't hold a charge at all. maybe they are repackaging those old, dead batteries! WORTHLESS."
3,"real price is higher than listed, S&H applies to each, even though shipped together","The batteries don't seem to hold a charge as long as the OEM that came with the phone, but they're adequate if you don't use your phone much. They indicate a full charge before they really are. Don't believe the ""charge complete"" message.My biggest complaint, which the seller disputes, is that they charge the same amount of S&H; for multiples of the same item, and they ship in one package. Obviously, they are not charging the true price for the battery, they're making it up in S&H; charges. Their customer service department seems to think this is ok because they tell you they're going to do it up front. To me, that's like it's ok to rob someone because the robber says ""give me your wallet"". Hey, you know what's going to happen up front, right?"
5,Battery,The first battery the company sent was defective but after I contacted them they sent a replacement right away.
3,Razr Battery,"It does not seem to me that this battery holds a charge for very long. After two or three hours of use, it requires recharging."
2,certainly NOT like new,"The two batteries I received were new, at least in the sense of having never been used, but neither of them hold a charge. I suspect they are both quite old and have been sitting on a shelf for some time. Not surprising since the phone I'm using is also quite old."
2,Arrived after month,Order on May 5 received on June 1. Too less time to comment on how good it is. But so far so good. Very disappointed with the shipping time!
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"Based on ""not so favorable"" reviews, I ordered two batteries hoping at least one of them would perform. Neither holds a charge longer than 5 minutes after a full night of charging. I'm now in the process of trying to return them for a refund. I'm sure in the end I'll have paid as much for shipping as the two batteries cost. Buyer BEWARE!"
1,Motorola Razor Battery,I ordered this BR50 battery for my razor phone. I received a BR56 battery. I can only assume it was the same thing. It was the same size and looked the same except for the #. It was advertised brand new and was a good price. The problem is it that it didn't work any better than my old one. Before the day was over it was dead and I very seldom even talk on my phone.
1,BUYER BEWARE ~ total scam!!!,"got this battery at the beginning of March to replace RAZR battery that wouldn't last a day anymore (it originally would last 2-3 days on average amount of usage) upon receiving it, this battery would only hold a charge about a day and as of now (mid-june) it no longer will take a charge.in other words, this IS NOT an OEM Motorola battery, please avoid."
3,Good product. However...,Got the battery on time. Good price and all. But somehow its making my phone freeze a lot. And i can say it is the battery since i put the old one in and no problems during the day altough my original battery doesnt hold the charge that well. So i guess theres norhing i can do about it. Im thinking since my razr v3m its verizon and it comes w a different battery ( in just looks i guess) still somewhat not xompatible the phone. I also understand that it is a 6 year old phone just used as a replacement its not much of a loss. Still would reccomend
3,Size Small Velma Costume,"I bought this costume in a size small (size 4-6 according to the package) for my daughter who currently wears 24-month clothing. I figured the glasses and wig were worth the $15ish dollars and I could alter the shirt and skirt to get her through the few hours she would be wearing it. The shirt is so small that I can't get it over her head (hat size 18-24 mos.) and the skirt fits with no altering, although it is long. There is absolutely no way this costume would fit a child who wears a size 4-6. Quality wise, the wig and glasses are great. The skirt and shirt, while flimsy, are exactly what I expect from a $15 Halloween costume."
1,Poor quality,Not a good product - cheap material makes this a waste of money. My daughter really liked the outfit and wore it a couple of times before Halloween but the shirt began to come apart just in that time.
1,Cheap product,"This product was such a disappointment. The material was thin and shapeless and cheap. It looked like the company took the cheapest material they could find and sewed them together. The neckhole for the shirt had no elasticity so it hurt my 7 year-old's head to force it on, which was the only way it was going to get on. It will NOT fit a 9 or 10 year-old's head at all. The only things that made the outfit cute were the glasses and the wig (the shoes and socks were not included) and as cute as they were, they were not worth the cost of the outfit. Trust me, it would be worth your time and effort to go to a fabric store and make this outfit yoursef. It was horrible."
3,Not the Best Fear Street Book,"Three girls, who are best friends, are going camping. It is supposed to be an ""all-girls camping trip"" with no guys. But on the trip they meet guys who want to hang out with them; will they be able to turn them down?On the camping trip, scary and dangerous things happen, but I will not tell you what happens so that I don't ruin the book for you. Will the girls pull through, or will they be victims?There were too many boring ""adventures"" for me in this book. I don't care about rock climbing or white-water rafting. I didn't see a real deep plot, even taking into consideration that this is a teen book. I wouldn't have liked it any better if I had of read it as a teen, because I've never liked boring adventures.My favorite R.L. Stine books are ""Hit and Run"", ""The Rich Girl"", and my very favorite, ""The Babysitter"" (I-IV)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Sentient ship family.Set in the same world as the Farseer series of books, and geographically within trading distance this book is about a family that crews one of the sailing ships made of a magical wood that are actually alive.When the father of the family dies the new owner of the ship comes as a surprise. After this, with the usual problems of trying to make a living in this industry throw in piracy on top of that, and pirate romance even.Nowhere near as interesting to me as the Farseer books, unfortunately."
5,Possibly the best book I've ever read,"Well maybe not quite, BUT very good! I couldn't believe it when I saw a re-issue of this in hardcover. I was so bummed 'cause I thought it was the second book in the series! I went back and tried to buy all the old Megan Lindholm stuff I could find (thank you Powells for telling me the two are one and the same). Her work as Lindholm was extreemly good (try Harpy's Flight or Reindeer People) but this book and the Farseer trilogy are new heights. She breaks the staid mold of fantasy!"
2,A little too cheesy....,"I am 1/4 of the way in and I don't think I will continue reading. There's too many subplots going on and right now, I don't find myself caring about any of them. A little disappointing after falling in love with the Farseer Trilogy. But, I guess not EVERY book an author writes is going to be your favorite. I like aspects of this book but somehow not willing to see how it comes together. Wasn't crazy about talking boats or dragons either... Just me."
5,Fabulous High Fantasy!,"Awesome HIGH FANTASY!If you like your characters highly developed, ones that will step off the pages and into your heart... if you like action on the high seas with ships that have come alive(!)... if horrifically drawn sea serpents who follow them, waiting for ""food"" to go overboard sends a chill up your spine... if you like your politics and relationships between adversaries quite nasty... then this is the book for you! Cheers!"
4,"Not as interesting as the Farseer saga, but enjoyable and well written!","I first discovered Robin Hobb through FitzChivalry Farseer and the overall amazing Farseer saga, and I must say that she did not fail to impress! I hung on every word of every book of that series.The Liveship Traders book 1 is no less well written and contains a very notable unique element; namely, living ships! That being said, I haven't been able to invest in any of the characters of this novel as I did Fitz and his family and friends."
5,Surprising Format,"When I picked this book up at a bookstore, I instantly liked the cover. After reading the back, I put it back on the shelf. However, when I went back the next time, I went ahead and bought it. What a great book it was when I read it at last. The beginning was a little confusing, because the back of the book talked mostly about Althea Vestrit. The only thing i had a little trouble understanding was where the serpents fit into the story, and in the first few encounters, I didn't realize that they were serpents. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. What I didn't like was the fact that Hobb kept me hanging on the Brashen and Althea situation. (If you want to understand, read the book, it's too hard to explain here.) I absolutely recommend this book to any book lover."
3,It was okay,"I've read other books by Hobb and thoroughly enjoyed them, but somehow I just could not get envolved with this book. There were sooo many characters and sometimes you would have to wait through five to six chapters before Hob would return to that character so that you could find out what happened. This would normally not bother me in the least, but I never was able to form an attachment to any one character. I simply could not relate and because of that I simply could not enjoy the book as much. Granted the story itself was excellent and the world was well thought out. I think if Hobb would have focused on fewer charactesr and attempted to developed them more, I would have enjoyed it more.I finished this book, realizing in the end that nothing was solved and I would have to read through two more oversized ones before I would ever find out. I ended up only scanning through the next one and returning them to the library. Sorry, Amazon, but I am glad I did not bother to pay money for them."
5,I was really impressed with this book.,"I really enjoyed this book. I had never heard of the author before but this book had me going back to see if there were anymore titles available. I was sorry that the book ended and hope to learn more about these ""live ships"""
2,Same old stuff.,"This is probably a fine book for teenagers who devour every fantasy book their fingers can touch, and it is better written, technically, than a lot of fat, generic fantasy series. I'm inclined to categorize it as escapism, which is not so much a criticism as a shrug. There's nothing particularly special about the setting (liveships included); there's nothing inspiring or unique about the writing (I can think of dozens of authors who sound just like this one); the characters are standard teen/teen-like holograms that the reader is expected to project themselves onto; and at 809 pages, it is what every fantasy fanatic expects of a book these days -- complication without complexity, characterization without depth, darkness without getting your hands dirty, and a rather flat/acceptable/non-threatening view of storytelling.It's about the same as watching a mini-series on the Hallmark channel. It'll pass the time, but don't expect it to have any sort of impact on you."
5,Truly feel a difference!,"I'm doing my best as I get older to try and take better care of myself. That all started for me with proper hydrating. I try to drink at least a gallon of spring water each day. First thing in the morning I add 40 drops of this to my bottle of water and I can actually feel a bit of a ""power surge!"" 40 drops sounds like a lot, but it's actually 1/2 tsp (IIRC). A bottle will last a LONG time.Minerals often take a back seat to vitamins, but our bodies REQUIRE them to function properly and if you're not eating raw / organic / etc. This will help to fill that gap.These minerals are ionic in nature (as compared to colloidal) and your body can readily absorb them (as much as possible, anyhow)."
4,"Powerful, highly Concentrated!","In fact, this 8 oz. bottle is so powerful it will remineralize 192 gallons of plain water. That's how I use it: about six to eight drops per 6 oz. of distilled water. This product should not be taken straight because of the overwhelming saltiness of it, but when mixed with water it neutralizes fairly well. I'm confident I'm getting the trace minerals I'm lacking in my diet by using ConcenTrace, and I learned in the first week to mix it rather than take it straight because, like the bottle says, ""The most highly concentrated source of trace minerals in the world."""
4,Lots of Laughs---with Depth,"Tamara Drewe is a funny English film that made me laugh out loud. It's also a lot deeper than that---insights about life and how you want to live yours----just settle or be truly happy. Will you take the risk? Those questions were answered in the film. I enjoyed the t-shirt worn by the writer from America, actor Bill Camp. Who is Rex the Surf Dog anyway? Find out by going to his blog---[...]"
3,Modestly entertaining British farce,"Another art house flop at the box office, this Stephen Frears (""The Queen"") film features Gemma Arterton (""Prince of Persia"") in all her sexpot best. She kind of reminds me of Bridget Bardot from the 1950's and 60's. She flirts, she shows off her sexual skills and ultimately does the right thing. The film, set in pastoral England involves a gaggle of writers trying to put pen to paper or computer and publish something. The owner and his wife run the retreat & farm. He is also a relatively famous writer for a series of novels and in spite of his age (50 something) is still a hit with young attractive ladies. But he still loves his wife...uh huh. The farce has a few titters and the byplay between 2 teeny-boppers (watch out for up and coming actress Jessica Barden) and a rock star are pretty funny, but ultimately the comedy and the drama don't seem to match up well. Still, it is a modestly entertaining film."
3,"Sea Dog II, no!","I've been reading plenty of the other Reviews. There it goes again... Everyone says this game is ""Sea Dog II"". Despite in all regards it isn't. Not even close. I've myself played Sea Dog, and remember Sea Dog was created by a Russian Company. The ""Disney"" never bought the game.Sea Dog II is still developing. You can Search Sea Dog II on Gamespot.com or search Age of Pirates. The company decided to change the name to Age of Pirates.Sea DogsBy: Bethesda Softworks, AkellaSea Dogs II/ Age of PiratesBy: AkellaSD II/ AOP will be using a new render Storm II. I can't wait till it comes out.---Oh and by the way, ""Pirates of the Carribean"" was a good game, but I've been spoiled by Sea Dogs and other better sea-faring games. I recommend you to buy Sea Dogs II/ AOP when it arrives and not POTC."
1,Great while it lasted,"As with a previous user, the connection became loose very quickly (within 2 weeks) and does not provide a good connection between the power pack and cord to the computer. I am purchasing a different product... too bad, I loved the idea and design of this one. Not recommended."
1,Can be bought elsewhere.,"This is the best game I have ever played. That being said, go to your local Best Buy and buy World in Conflict Soviet Assualt for $20."
3,No Skirmish. Place your units in specific circles,"I was looking forward to this game to be like Company of Heroes.Iam disappointed.The graphics are not top notch although the physics effects are good.Plus the storyline is awful.Once you complete the campaigns, the game ends. Period. I mean that's it. No other choice like skirmish, etc.Plus the campaign itself consists of placing your units in specific circles or areas.If you take the tutorial, and you quit in middle, you can't continue tutorial from where you left off. You need to start from begining.The movies are great, the cutscenes are good, plus the physics if awesome.But all of this pales in comparison to the phenomenally awful storyline, lack of skirmish option and no easier user controls."
2,This game sucks,"Compared to the old one this game is nothing. I will say it has much better graphics and some cool new fetures, but the roster sucks now (besides adding Lita, Hogan, and Austin). The playing is much more complicated and the new matches suck. The original bra and panties was a lot cooler than the new whatever the hell it's name is. The burried alive match is ok but still boring. The GM mode is hard because you can't keep superstars happy, they always get hurt, and you can never trade. Designing an entrance takes a long time and everytime you want to see a camara angle you have to wait forever for it to load. The season mode sucks and the locker room thing isn't really that cool. If I were you I would rather save my money and get the new Need For Speed or something better than this piece of (cencered for young ears)."
4,2006 Smackdown vs. Raw,"this is a fun game with great graphics and they have improved the contol you have over the characters,the one thing that disappointed me about the game is in career mode you only have one year of season then its over,other than that this is a real good game."
4,Dissapointed,"Don't get me wrong,this game is fun,but,it dosen't have the other superstars such as,Ashley,Crystal,Boogeyman,MNM,Paul Burchell,Mickie james,Maria,etc.And the divas can only participate in fulfill your fantasy,Special referee,womens title match etc..they can't even be in season mode.the game is fun though.Also kurt angle is not on his right show.and christy hemme,and joy giovanni,are no longer in the wwe.it is not a waste of money,the create a superstar is updated.one more thing,when the females are on a team,thier entrances are manly.so 2 the creaters of this game,do aa better job next time,because i love wrestling."
5,WWE SMACKDOWN VS RAW '06,"THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED SVR 2006 IS OUT ON PS2 AND PSP. I'LL GIVE YOU THE PROS AND CONS:PROS:1.GREAT ANIMATION.2.AWSOME LEGENDS.3.TITLES DEFENDABLE IN EXHIBITION MODE.4.BETTER ROSTER.5.CREATING TITLE BELTS IS LESS EXPENSIVE.6.CHALLENGE MODE NOW 2 PLAYERS.7.GM MODE.8.GREAT SEASON.9.EXCELLENT VOICE-OVER.10.

(e.g. MARK JINDRAK,HAAS,SPIKE DUDLEY etc.)3.SEASON TO SHORT.OVERALL 9.5/10"
2,Tips-e ----- more like Tipsy!,You'd better be stone cold sober when you wear these shoes as the sole isn't flat but goes up on the sides making balancing very difficult. Why in the world they would make it this way is beyond me.
5,Loved this movie!,"This was a feel good movie. Acting was excellant. I loved both main actors. Funny, exciting and heart warming. Loved it!"
4,Fun and lighthearted,"This was a fun and lighthearted comedy. The actors are all pro's and give a solid performance. The story is predictable, but Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston are reliable actors and make the movie fun to watch."
1,Fell Asleep Waiting for Something to Happen,"My title says it all. I even went to two redboxes to find this movie and was frustrated when it started skipping. But I got it to play, kept watching, woke up periodically, tried to force myself to pay attention....wait, isn't this supposed to be entertainment?It just didn't do it for me. Looking at reviews here and elsewhere, it seems like you'll either love it or hate it. I don't think I laughed a single time. I just kept waiting for something to happen. And fell asleep waiting."
2,Worst of 2010...so far,"Unwatchable is all I can say about this ridiculous flick. Even wifey hated it and she loves these sappy chick flicks. Two hours seemed like twenty. If you are female and under 18, you will love this faux romantic comedy. For everyone else, you have been warned to save your money and use your time for something else. This is two hours you will regret having spent watching these sleepy, uninteresting characters. Aniston made a few movies tenish years ago that were fun i.e. Office Space, but the last few years she has been involved with progressivly worse movies. Two stars ONLY because she is still nice to look at. Skip it."
2,"It was kind of funny, kind of dumb","It was kind of dumb. there was some funny parts, but I thought they could do a better job. I wouldn't watch it again."
3,ok,"It's an ok movie... It was cute at times, and had a couple of laughs, and also seemed a bit odd at others"
3,Little kid was great...,"This was almost boring due entirely to Aniston's bleak performance. She seemed bored, tired, and just not interested in anything, including any of her love interests. There was like zero chemistry between her and Jason Bateman. Despite that, Jason Bateman and the little kid, Bryce Robinson, stole the movie, making it all worthwhile. When they both were on scene it was delightful. Whenever Aniston would hustle onto the screen, I would cringe inside, when she opened her mouth. I don't know if it's age or what, but she def did not seem into this job at all. The kid is amazing with his dour looks and funny ways. Perfect casting!"
2,Wow. Boring.,"I found this film predictable, tedious and not very smart. I don't watch a lot of romcoms, but gave this one a go since Jennifer Anniston is in it. Her last five movies received very poor ratings and this one was touted as one of the better ones. I gave it a shot and just didn't enjoy it and that sums up why I refuse to watch romcoms; most of them suck. The one romcom I can recommend is 500 Days of Summmer - that's a good one."
4,The Switch,"This was a very funny, very cute movie. I would watch it again. I did like the ending very much."
5,Great Movie!!,Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!! I will watch it again! Jennifer Anniston does her Usual Best!! Funny and Serious Too. Great Love story!
2,Close but no cigar,"There are worse ways to spend a Friday evening - however, despite the attractive and likeable cast - this is strictly by the numbers."
3,Fairly predictable,"Ok movie, not any big surprises. Plot is simple and characters are developed fairly. 3 stars is about right for an average movie."
3,Good,A little disappointing some of the bonus artist was tape from TV not live. And it shouldn't had been so much break up of the artisit performance. If there doing more than one song let it be play and go on to the next artist.
3,Not Much To Rave About!,"This Cd has Rick Derringer pounding the pavement with blues again and it can get a lil annoying.There are a few real winners here like:Hide Away 1962,Something Inside Of Me and Checkin Up On My Baby but the rest of the CD fails to impress."
3,i would recommend yo a 14 year old,I founds it hard to follow somethimes as there was a lot of twists in it . I thought the ending could be better.
4,REQUIRED for the remixes at end of tiger and duke,"This CD is bazare. like everyone says. VERY bazare. BUT a lot of the funky noises and remixes in the tiger and the duke are featured in this album. If you need a song to look for to get into this album look to This Heat. That song takes so many different directions in its 10 mins, that I deem it one of my favorite TSOAF songs. plus its got keith singing (good old war), who is the man."
1,what is this??,"what happened to this band??? this is terrible. tiger and the duke was so amazing and technical. but this cd is just a bunch of noises. only one song actually has guitar in it.. and its really annoying. 14 tracks of nothing. dont buy this. buy tiger and the duke, or a sasoin or circa survive cd instead."
2,I tried to like it but...,I really just couldn't get into it. I am a huge fan of Tiger and the Duke and was anticipating this album highly. When i first listened to it I was dissapointed. I found it slow and uninteresting in some parts. So I tried listening to it numerous times and while I can listen to some tracks I tend to skip over many and get bored. Is this album artsy? Yes. Do they have talent? Yes. But it just isn't my taste.
4,Bugs Bunny's Festival of Fun,"This is an okay video, because it contains two Friz Freleng classics, ""Baseball Bugs""(1946) and ""Rhapsody Rabbit""(1946). It also contains the brilliant 1944 Bob Clampett cartoon, ""Hare Ribbin'"", in which nearly the whole cartoon takes place underwater, quite elaborate for a Warners cartoon."
1,VOODOO DUDS,ALL THE MOVIES STUNK.THEY WERE ALL OLD AND LOOKED LIKE THEY TRANSFERED THEM FROM OLD TAPES TO DVD.THE QUALTY AND SOUND WAS REALLY BAD.
2,"3 to 4 years of life, used 4 times, battery and charger dead!","I used this battery with the drill about 4 times max in a span of about 3.5 years. Then both batteries and the charger were dead. I took it to a DeWalt / B&D; service center and the technician confirmed they were both dead. Another reviewer said the same thing; that they both die. You lose both batteries and charger. Since these are Ni-Cad I used to drain the batteries to avoid memory but another user said one should not drain completely with the charger they recommend, maybe that is the trick. I don't know.Now I have a B&D; drill in mint condition but it's a better investment for me to buy another drill that comes with a better battery life. I found a Lithium powered drill for a good price during Black Friday deals."
1,False Advertising,This Battery is not the HSB14 it is advertised to be!!It is the standard black batt. Although it fits the Anneversary B&D Amazon is misleading it's customers.
5,Battery,"Product was exactly what I wanted. I looked at four different stores including Lowes and Home Depot and couldn't find it anywhere else, at least not for the price. Completely satisfied."
2,Incorrect Item???,"The two previous reviews chastize Amazon.com for advertizing this item as the battery for the Black & Decker Anniversary Edition Drill. Looking at the picture of this item I would have realized it wasn't the correct item because it is black. However, I have searched the Black & Decker sites for the very same, but silver, Anniversary Edition battery pack and cannot locate it anywhere. I think more blame must go to Black & Decker because I believe they discontinued the drill and the correct replacement battery pack. Then again, Amazon.com was wrong to advertize this one as the Anniversary Edition pack. Another but, Black & Decker wants $49.00 for this same pack, so why not order it from Amazon for the above price of $40.00? I will after I hear back from Black & Decker."
2,Hot to the point of burning finger tips,"Its a cute looking computer. Light and a perfect size. BUT, it gets so hot that I basically can not use it after about half an hour. The cursor area is untoucahble. Even typing is uncomfortble and unplesant because of the heat and the high temperature of the keyboard.I wish I had bought it at Costco so I can take it back but unfortunately I bought here from Amazon and dont think it is returnable. Dont buy it."
4,Still kicking,"Glad to hear the Subdudes back together and cranking out that unique sound of theirs. I had to buy this CD as soon as I heard the first single on the radio, and it didn't disappoint."
1,weak construction,"The product shipment was unsatifactory. It arrived with a truck witn no lift gate and only a driver. I had to hire three people to bring the generator down the truck. Next, the assembly instructions were not adequate, parts were missing and there were rwo broken parts on the frame."
1,the people at SOE are bait and switching liers,"This was a wonderful game in 2004/2005 untill a upgrade call CU ( combat upgrade) was put in place.hundreds of people quit the game and tryed to kill the game by not paying so that the game would die, then 6 months later after 1/2 of us realy start learing how to play good thay spring the New Game enhancement NGE for short on us and have KILLED the jedi to where any one is better than jedi.i strongly say DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! you will get hooked and end up paying $15 a month just to hang with the people.save your self from this game and DONT BUY IT!!!!!"
1,SOE socks it to their customers once again,SOE took a great game and twice totally changed the game for the worse with no input from veteran players who had invested much in time and money.The game went from 32 to 9 professions with the professions totally changed. Last April they did the same thing and surprised uw with a totally different game. Neither was an improvement. THEY ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to listen to their customers and as a result have lost tons of players. The servers are now ghost towns.
3,Not the star wars fantasy,"Very boring, bugged, quests where no NPC ever moves and its just plain stupid, to much lag and with the NGE combats fun but not professions, a billion jedi wander everywhere and its jsut wrong to have that many jedi. It is still a fun, soacial game with lots of places to explore and venture, but all the planets are almost idenical and all the houses are the same, its just stupid how easy it is to see that sony did a sloppy job.BUT it is still fun at a leval"
1,An awful game,"SOE and Lucas Arts turned what was a great game into something not worth buying. There are many better games out there to spend your money on.SWG never made the numbers expected, and in an attempt to increase the subscriber base they completely changed the game. The end result has been a collapse of the community as all the rewards that veterans worked for have been devalued."
1,Godawful!,"Pay no attention to the lemmings touting this game's virtues. I still have an active gamecard account (until it runs out), and a quick look at the servers for SWG show a wasteland. Coronet, once the most populated city on nearly every server is a ghost town. Last saturday there were 4 people at the mining outpost on Dantooine, a month ago there would have been 100 on a saturday night.The CU encourages grouping, good luck finding a group. I feel sorry for new players trying to get started. There are no CRAFTERS anymore! Have fun finding decent equipment.Go ahead, waste your money. Might as well flush it down the toilet."
1,Buyer Beware!,"My son pestered me for this game purchase. It arrived very quickly and my son opened it before reading the very fine print requiring additional purchase to play this game online. Needless to say, he has learned a valuable lesson because it is unreturnable and has absolutely no trade-in value at the local game store. Unable to review the game itself because I won't allow him to spend that outrageous monthly/yearly fee. The purchase information is not listed on Amazon's site and only available if you take the link to GameStop's site. It's like $180/year to play - what a rip-off! Don't be fooled as we were - do your homework first!"
1,Pass it on because of SOE,I played this..not impressed. The servers are very bare of users. The SOE team was rude to me and cancelation of my acount was a large hassle. IT took several calls to get them to stop charging me. I will never buy a SOE game again..
1,"Boring content, slow combat","This is a waste of time for online players. Since the changes Nov 15, 2005, this game is more buggy and laggy than ever. The content is sorely missing and the combat is slow. I would suggest checking out other online games Amazon has to offer because this one is a disappointment."
1,game not like mmorpg,This game is not like an mmorpg at all. It is like a fps that has no system of aiming or any kind of skill involve. you just click and hope it will hit the enemy good.
2,Through One Ear And Out The Other,"I don't know what everyone else is listening to, but I listened to LeToya's new album and I was completely bored out of mind. There was not a single song that stood out. Every song was forgettable and could basically be sung by anybody and you know I'm right. There's nothing new here and Letoya's personality is barely present. The only good thing I could say about Letoya is that her singing doesn't irritate me like Beyonce's. That's pretty much it."
5,I bet LeToya has ruffled a few feathers !!!,"Where do I start, what do I say??? I bought this cd on the strength of one single called ""She Don't"". I normally wait to hear a few songs before I commit to a whole album but I have not been dissappointed.This cd is FANTASTIC. Track after track is pure entertainment. No skipping through, just leave it in the player and it delivers good music. The club bangers are great but it's the ballads where LeToya shows her real strength.The good thing is that she won't be slept on like some artists because she already has a fan base from her DC days. I am so so glad she left DC. She would never have got her shine. We would never have heard her beautiful voice above the screaming and catterwailing of the lead singer. I am so so rooting for LeToya. This is her moment and no one is going to block her blessings this time around. Go Toya !!"
3,Hopefully she gets all the blessing that she deserve.,"All I can say is that this album is alright and it's great that she finally got this album out. My favorites are ""Tear Da Club Up"", ""Torn Remix"", ""Gangsta Grillz"", and ""What Love Can Do,"" other than that it's really nothing to rave about."
4,Decent Album,"I actually like this album, her voice may not be the best but this is the first album i could say had the club tunes. I hate the albums where all they talk about is how they love a guy, he cheated and she has to find a way to leave him. Although toya has one song like that, that is pretty much it, her album celebrates how she got it goin on, how she loves her man and how she's gonna show us what we needed to see when she was in destiny's child. I love it , excellent job latoya. and all the people saying no song stood out, you're out of your mind, haters haters haters, clearly all the haters are beyonce fans."
5,Very Cool,This book is a great all around kind of reference book. Covering a wild variety of plants it includes lots of interesting details such as traditional preparation and chemical structure for active ingredients. Highly recommended.
3,Could be more,"I found the book intresting, but short. Thus even though I am an herbalist I would not recomend it unless the reader wants as complete a library as possable on the subject."
4,Nice footage,"Just got WW 2 in hd i sat and watched the whole thing,thought it was a good vid. interesting storys of the airmen that fought the war."
5,"As of Jan 23,2013 I have not recieved this movie","Have not recieved this movie as of 23 Jan 2013, and am patiently waiting on delivery. please expidited this delivery"
2,Cursory Look at the Edmund Fitzgerald,"This book is only 46 pages,not 70 as advertised. The $14 is far too much to pay for such a small booklet. It just provides a cursory look at the incident. No in depth look,interviews or details. I was disappointed and was expecting more than I got."
1,Don't Buy This!,"Like Joe in the previous review, I concur. This is a terrible vacuum cleaner. It blows out anything that's inside of it, so you end up not only with the same mess, but with dust particles in your eyes. It's a terrible waste of money."
1,stupid vacuum dust blower.,"This vacuum blows out dust and particles just as fast as it is sucking it. It's the worst product of Black&Decker.; When you are cleaning your car, full dust blows to your face!!!Black & Decker 12V DustBuster Auto Vacuum Cleaner"
4,Good,Very Good lo recomiendo practico confortable y economico ............... ............. .. .. . . . . . . . .
2,Poor quality for the price,"I am giving these a bad review because for $100 they are nowhere near the quality they should be. The sound was fine and the wireless worked well (they are infrared so the transmission doesnt go through walls, and the sound is poor at more than 10 ft. away), but the microphone for xbox live didnt work well at all. At first it didnt work at all, but when I put the mute switch in-between ON and OFF I was finally able to talk to my friends on live. But even then the sound was poor. When I put the microphone back on that came with the xbox they could hear me very well. Conclusion: the microphone stinks.Overall, the sound was good and it was cool having wireless headphones, but the microphone stinks. So do yourselves a favor: if youre going to spend $75-$100 for a pair of wireless headphones, get the good kind that transmit thru walls, etc. that dont have an xbox live mic, cuz you wont use the mic anyway."
3,EarForce Headset by Turtle Beach,"The acoustics are fine.Wireless is fine, although there are problems connecting at times.No crackling or ""white noise"" during play, acoustics are fine.Volume is adjustable by in-line on/off switch.Goes through two (2) AAA batteries in 6-8 hours of play.The biggest problem with this headset is the material the earphones are made of - a criss-cross fabric that rubs against and irriates your ears and head after wearing for a long time. The fabric is durable, but not comfortable while wearing for hours at a time."
3,Meh...,pros:reasonable priceextremely long battery lifeworks as describedcons:ear cups are child sized / hurts after a few hoursmy mic cord broke after a week like everyone else's
3,Overall just OK,"For $80, I was expecting more. These things are large, and the included stand is lightweight and falls over. They fit comfortably on my head, but the plastic feels cheap and the band isn't as tight as I would like. I have a normal sized head, so the cranium isn't the issue.Sound quality is on the high end of average. Extreme bass doesn't sound that great when cranked up, but at reasonable volumes, it is just fine.If I had to do it over again, I would probably buy something else spending a little more if necessary. If you need wireless headphones that also allow you to talk on XBOX live, I don't know of a competing product that beats this."
2,Not good for chat,"If you use chat, don't buy these headphones.When chatting, the microphone frequently picks up electronic interference. My teammates complain of loud humming, and my voice becomes quiet or completely inaudible. One minute it'll be working great, and the next minute it's worthless.On the plus side, they're very comfortable and the sound is great compared to my little TV speakers. And when it's actually working, the microphone sounds better than the standard Microsoft headset.If you use chat, you'll be better off with the standard Microsoft headset. If you don't use chat, you'll probably like these."
1,Really Disappointed...,"I buddy of mine has this headset and loves it (hasn't had any problems), so I ignored the two other reviews and purchased one. Turns out I should have just spent my money elsewhere. I had the same problems with three different games (Project Gotham Racing 3, Need for Speed and GRAW). Once the game audio starting building, the volume would either drop or cut out completely. Rev an engine...audio cuts out...two guys shooting...audio cuts out. Other problems included the sound was reversed (noise on right side of screen came in on left headset, even though I had everything wired correctly) and horrible sound quality through the mic. No one that I was playing online with could hear me, even with the mic up against my mouth.Maybe I just got a bad unit...but it was so bad I didn't even bother to try a second one, I just returned it and got my money back."
3,Second Chance,"Back Cover Description: ""Some day you will come to me on your knees and beg me to take you...and I will break you.""Six years ago Carlo Saracini had flung those words at Jessica. She'd fought him to the last, but now she faced a choice: three months in Carlo's bed, or her father would go to gaol. Maybe Jessica had been forced to her knees, but she would never give in - because she also remembered Carlo's final vow: ""I will never forgive you.""Typical of L. Graham's stories and not too bad. This heroine has money, or comes from it anyway. The hero is Greek and typical Alpha, but not as mean as some of Ms. Graham's men usually are. Jessica met Carlo while she was engaged, and wouldn't break her engagement to be with Carlo. Six years later she's a widow and her father is in trouble. Yes there is another female lusting after Carlo and will Jessica tell him the truth about her marriage? If you like this author, you'll like this story."
3,Not long enough,"There is so much cool stuff that was on Liquid TV that is not on this DVD that one struggles to consider it 'The Best of'. Where are the 'Dear Mum' sketches, or the Oingo Boingo song 'Don't go in the Basement', or the 'Istanbul was Constantinople' song, or 'The Art School Girl's of doom, or 'Dog Boy'? None of it is here. Sure we have some cool stuff like couple of 'Stick Figure Theatre' sketches and some 'Bobby and Billy' and, the way past cool, Aeon Flux. But I reckon there won't be any other DVDs of Liquid TV so go right out and buy this. It's still worth it."
4,Good Deal,"For the price of a cordless edger, it was a really good deal. I wouldn't suggest this if you had a large lawn, unless you have an extra battery."
1,Hilarious book. For NON-thinking people.,Why has evolution stopped? Why are there still chimps? I came from a tadpole.........yeah. Ridiculous theory that is outdated. And why are we still teaching this drivel to our children as if it holds water?
5,We love this book,"There are probably a jillion books about National Parks, but this one has the information a family with growing kids needs to make the most of visits to them. With this book as a guide, we have already visited over a dozen East Coast parks, and it has been of great assistance, especially in helping maximize the experience for the parks we only had a limited time to enjoy. We continue to use it to help map out our trips, we will be hitting 3-4 more parks this summer."
4,Freedom of Thought,"I recently read this book in a class at school and found it to be provocative and intelligent. I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews for this work. I am not Jewish, nor do I think you need to be Jewish to appreciate this author's message: ""what is old is new again."" I am Phillipino, Catholic and female...I belive that's three srtikes against me in the areas of priveledge, wealth and influence. Yet, I could relate to this author's message...not because I'm politically correct but because I'm open-minded. Too often, people shut out unpleasant meessages or ideas that challenge their hard and fast beliefs about equality, oppression and human rights. While I'm sure my positive review of this book will garner many unhelpful votes as well ( quite possibly by people who want to silence this author's message) don't let yourself be told what to think...go out and think for yourself!"
1,Nothing More Than a Microsoft Sales Pitch,"If you are looking for practical assistance with HIPAA compliance, look elsewhere. This is nothing but a very long adervertisement for Microsoft products."
1,Lasted One Wash Cycle,"These will probably work great if you use them on jeans that will never be washed again. I pulled mine out of the dryer and found the patches either hanging on by a thread, or curled up inside the legs. If you have other jeans that are completely worthless, cut them up and use them as sew-on patches. These aren't worth it. If you insist on buying iron-on patches, just go to the grocery store; same quality at equal or lesser price."
5,"Yes, it is excellent.","You cannot feel that it is in brand new condition. So, it is just conformtable."
1,no product!!!,"I ordered this shoes and they said they will sent it and the estimated date is 27 September. Then after a week they said they don't have that shoes anymore and can't send it. what the heck, just go out from bussiness!!!"
3,I am happy with them,"I ordered 9.5's, because that's what I normally wear, but the shoes don't have any padding to speak of, so they feel a little big. I like the look, so I'll probably go get some Dr. Scholl's Inserts and start gellin' like a fellon."
4,good shoe great price,"its very comfortable, i could slip in without undoing the laces and the 30 bucks free shipping is the best part, ive even gotten a few compliments on them"
5,This book was really good,"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were described well and seemed life-like. The plot was great and i didn't want to put the book down till i finished.I read the book in 2 days, i didn't want the book to end. I really enjoyed this book and i think everyone should read this book. It is very exciting."
5,Martinusen combines poetic prose with masterful pacing,"Cindy Martinusen has masterfully woven the past with the present in Winter Passing--and somehow made me analyze my own preconceived notions. She has combined beautiful poetic prose with masterful pacing and characters that are not predictable. Her strong research and attention to detail put you right in contemporary Austria--a wonderful, can't-put-down trip from the first page to the last. I recommend it highly."
5,Jaws of Death,"The copy I received in DVD form was perfect. Many thanks for the memories - I wrote the screenplay under a nom de plume because the director couldn't read . . . I also wrote the concepts for Lucky Lady with Burt Reynolds and the TV series In Search Of . . . plus wrote and directed Bloodstalkers and ""starred"" in The Search for Bigfoot while appearing too in the Smithsonian Series ""Monsters Myth or Mystery"""
4,Both western novels have plenty of action,"The travails of Touch the Sky continue as he remains a pariah among certain Cheyenne warrior societies. The first book is about slave traders in Texas who intend to sell Cheyenne women and children into slavery but Kiowa and Comanche chiefs covet a pretty Cheyenne maiden for themselves. A small Cheyenne rescue party sets out to save her and the rest of the captives before it's too late. The second book is okay and is about white men who masquerade as Cheyennes to bring trouble to a band of Indians as part of a personal vendetta by one of the army officers. Fine page turners but ""Comancheros"" is the best of the two books by a wide margin."
3,Interesting But Difficult,"I have been interested in cosmology from when I first watched Carl Sagan and I have been reading about the subject ever since. I am not qualified to provide critiques of any technical aspects of this book however I can say that I did enjoy it though I found it overall difficult to comprehend. It seemed that it may have been written for those with greater knowledge than those whose primary instruction is from watching science programs, perhaps a ""For Dummies"" version will be someday be made available for us."
5,Jacky Faber back again!,"Now Jacky is trying to find her beloved Jaimy whom she has not recieved any letters from. When she finds him he's with another girl! Jacky is horrified and promises to live alone. Even with serveral men claiming they love her Jacky will always stay true to her heart and that means not talking to or about ""him"". During her acts she is accused of being a pirate! No, not Jacky Faber. Jacky is her wild self yet again. If Louis Meyer leaves us off eith that cliff hanging ending I'm gonna hunt him down! It's difinatly just as good as the other two books!"
5,Better than Pepper,"After getting dumped by Elektra, Ween have released a proper follow-up to The Mollusk. Instead of the forced whimsy of White Pepper we find The Brothers Ween going off in the direction of the earlier album's mixture of effacement and ambition. Personally, I am greatful. Whereas many bands when creating whimsy evoke Syd Barrett and Robyn Hitchcock, Ween scares up Residents flashbacks (ie ""Neighborhood"")amidst subtle pokes at the Prog Rock camp. While the band's reputation is built on coarsenss and eclecticism, Quebec supercedes these expectations. Like The Mollusk, this album seeks to create a synthesis which while humorous isn't a joke. This subtle distinction allows these songs to co-exist. Nice job, guys, hope to see you soon."
4,Vive Quebec!,"After a much delayed release (due to a label change), Ween strikes back with a vengence with Quebec. With a promise to return to 'the browner aspects of ween,' the album's opening track bears similarities to The Pod's ""You F---ed Up."" From there it's a Mollusk-esque journey from Zoloft, which was obviously written under the influence of its title, to the quiet, although somehwat boring, finale of Alcan Road. Also on this cd is a catchy, bouncy and updated version of 'Hey There Fancy Pants,' which is of Crank Yankers fame. Probably the best track is the warped jam of So Many People in the Neighborhood.Noticably absent is the infamous ""Where'd the Cheese Go?"" song that was pitched for a Pizza Hut commercial and subsequently rejected. But it's omission is entirely forgiveable considering the scope of this zany album. Yes everyone, Ween is back, and they're browner then ever."
2,The first mediocre Ween album.,"Quebec is Ween's first album apart from Elektra, and the production value of this disc is just not what we've come to expect from ween since Guava.This would not necessarily be a problem - should they return to the entertainment value of The Pod and God Ween Satan.But that's just the problem - this songs on this album do not have the high polished production quality we've come to accept and love, nor does it have the crude but entertaining quality of the earlier albums.It starts out strong enough with the punk rock ""It's Gonna Be A Long Night"", which invokes memories of God Ween Satan's ""You F#*ked Up"". But this track not half as strong. From here on out, there are no standout songs. The thing just cruises along in 2nd gear - with songs that sound like they are not quite finished or in slow motion.Buy the other Ween albums first, or -even better- the new Live CD exclusive from Ween.com."
5,all hail the boognish,"oh yes, another great ween album. in response to the ""featured review"" i think ween is at least ten times as talented as the beatles. the songs of Ween have never been much less than accessible, if peculiar. i'm personally baffled as to why some songs haven't been big hit singles yet.but i suppose being what they are, Ween is perpetually resigned to being a cult band. bah, long live cults i say!while this album is not as classic as, say, Pure Guava or The Mollusk, its definitely up there and i think its superior to their last album White Pepper. they really have to stop leaving 3-4 year gaps in-between albums. i hope they tour near me.anyway, if you're a ween fan you have to own this, so this review is superfluous. if you're not, give it a try, this might be the one to convert you."
1,Evil and wrong. Steer clear.,"Sprayer worked for about 45 seconds and then clogged. Called Wagner. ""support staff"" at wagner was Very unhelpful. I returned the sprayer which I'm very happy about."
1,Did Not Work And Went In The Trash,"I bought this unit from Costco. I hoped to save time in painting a garage. I found the unit rediculously over packed requiring way too much time to unpack and set up. It is jammed with hard to remove plastic plugs and paper which makes set up time consuming. After setting it up, searching for the stupid drain valve that one must hit twice before using, I turned it on and all I got was a stream and not a spay of paint. I switched from prime to spay a couple of time and it still would not work. It stalled everytime I switched to spray. At this time I was one hour into the project and no paint was on the garage. I decided to place this product where I put all my worthless tools. Into the dumpster. With gas at $3.00 a gallon I wasn't about to drive 170 miles back to Costco to return it. If and when I want to buy another paint sprayer I will make sure it is engineered in Germany or Japan. I buy tools to save time not waste it."
4,Works great when it works...,"Unit works very well, but it seems that each time I get started I have to mess a bit with it, disassemble, clean it up again, and then it works fine. Maybe I am doing something wrong. Nonetheless, it works great and is a tremendous timesaver for big projects."
2,"It is a great sprayer if you use it for one job, and don't expect anymore","This is a great sprayer if you keep your expectation low on the durability side. It does its job well for small to medium size jobs. However, if you don't mind spending countless hours trying to clean, fix and jiggle the thing to work and frustration that comes with it, it is a good product. Now to be fair, I believe all paint sprayers have similar problems and same issues with cleaning and maintaining. We sprayed our exterior of the house and three bedroom interior space with this product. When we went back to reuse it for another job, despite spending an hour to clean and following the manual for the maintenance, the machine did not work the second time around. I think for $200, was it a good DIY tool? I give it ""YES""."
3,"It's Called ""Fantastic Realism""...","...and to write successfully in this genre, the first rule is to provide the most fluid transitions possible between the fantasy and the reality. This has not been accomplished here, even though the effort is nothing to scoff at. Nesmith's head is definitely in the right place, and with a little more work he could probably do the same for literature as he has for music and television. But while this book's reachings span from popular culture to mythology to bad diner food, the transitions in between all of the different subjects were as graceful as the choreography in... well, a typical Monkees video. It's a shame, because with a few more tweakings this could have been a great work of Americana. Still, someone out there could turn this American patchwork into a very interesting movie. Are you listening, David Lynch?"
3,"Good historical material, but old production","This video has interesting historical summary, but it must have been made in the 70's, and we wish it were more up-to-date."
3,This is a bit dull but average overall,This movie is kinda dull but is average overall because its entartaining enough to watch because of its subject matter and execution. 7.5/10
1,Blue Ray will not run in my Sony player,First and formost the vendor of this product shipped on time and was very helpful with the problem with the Player. I can tell you this will be my last Sony purchase. The vendor credited the entire cost back to my account ***** (Five stars for the vendor).The Blue Ray loads and then starts the previews but whan it reached the main menu it freezes when you click Play it to play the video. Thank you this is just what we need is more copy protected junk on the market. I can't review the movie obviously because I could not watch it. I will not play on My PC with power DVD.
3,Didn't live up to hype,"I was extremely excited to watch The Company Men but maybe I should have read the background of the movie a little bit more to understand what this was all about. Though the movie has a star studded cast with solid acting, the overall depressing theme was tough to watch. Albeit this movie is about what happened to so many people in the recession, so I do understand that their point was hit. My biggest complaint was that there really didn't seem to be much of a plot. It dragged for 3/4 of the movie before I realized that there really wasn't much of one in the first place. I thought the film was scenic and it wasn't a complete waste of time, I just wouldn't pick it up if you want a feel good business movie."
3,Great cast but less than compelling,"I had high expectations for ""The Company Men"" with its great cast and very relevent subject, but I was disappointed. The producers couldn't resist turning this into a feel good sort of film. These stories don't usually turn out this way in real life. Try ""Up in the Air"" for a story that's more true."
3,Unenlightening,"I thought I was going to like this movie more than I did. It has a good subject and a great cast, but it is a one-note film. If you are used to captivating TV, like Mad Men, or the older Six Feet Under, this will seem quite thin on the ground. If you haven't lived in a cave the past few years, the story: corporate greed and the 21st century marketplace, is all too familiar."
4,Very sturdy,"I love our OEUF crib and this conversion kit is just as sturdy, easy to assemble (my husband and my 2 year old son had a blast putting it together). My only concern (and I cringe that I have to give it 4 stars since I love the crib so much) but the open space without a railing is a problem if you have a kid that moves a lot in his sleep. Our son is only 2 years and 3 months old and we thought he was ready to move to a toddler bed, and while he loves the freedom of getting in and out of bed on his own, he did fall off the bed the second night. We have carpet and it's a low bed so he didn't get hurt but that surely startled him. Maybe he's not ready yet to graduate to a toddler bed but for now there's array of soft pillows around his bed so if he falls again he can land on pillows. If your child doesn't make 180 degree turns all night long, then this conversion kit is perfect for you, very sturdy, easy to assemble, and very elegant (just like the crib)."
2,Poor quality,My daughter is in the fifth grade and wanted to join band and play the trumpet. She loves being unique so I got her this red trumpet within a week I had to take it to a repair shop becase she could only play one note. I wanted to get her a new one becasue the repair was almost as much as the brand new trumpet but she wanted it fixed. I recomend you spend your money on a actual trumpet that will not break in a weeks time.
2,Total clique,"These guys sound like every whiny emo band. I like emo, don't get me wrong, but these guys are not anything special in a genre of music where many bands sound the same. To be successful you have to be unique in this genre. These guy sound like a Saosin wanna be band, but not as good. I bet these guys just got a deal with Tooth and Nail because one of the members is brothers with Spencer of Underoath. WHo may I add are a great band."
1,UNSATISFYING PURCHASING,"When the item was received just arond last Christmas, it was polished shiny and the design was really attractive. However, after we used it and washed, we found the silver color truned little dark (not tarnished yet, but it seems like) and some spots look like peeling.Since we threw away the packing box, we felt not to return it. However, if the merchant agreed to accept the return without the box, we would appreciate it. Therefore, they would learn what the problem was. And they may feedback to the factory.Hoping to receive a good reply from the merchant soon."
1,Misleading,"I was very disappointed with this blue-ray. it does nothing. there are three stills of fish life, basically turning your tv into a lame fish tank. i thought it was a show about fish, not a still. i read the description too quickly, but even after going back to see what i missed, it wasn't that clear. NO WONDER this was discounted. TOTALLY UTTERLY lame."
4,"Relaxing, Beautiful DVD","I gave this film 4 stars because of the beautifull photography that is a relaxing way to spend ah hour or so. There is no plot whatsoever and the only action is of marine amimals swimming in their enviroment. IF you like this sort of thinf(I do, once in a while), then get this DVD."
4,"A little complicated at first, but worth it!","This is top of the line for Pioneer and well worth the extra cash! It's a little dodgy to play with at first, definitely use a CD-RW disc for your first few times!The only downside to this is that you have to use the Pioneer CD-R & CD-RW discs, other brands don't work in here. But the quality is excellent of the player, it records like a dream and is fun to use. I would recommend this to anyone who is sick of using tapes to record music."
5,tammy faye,"I love Tammy Faye and thank God for not only who she is, but for her love for a lost world. I'm so glad and encouraged personally that she has the guts to not only be herself, but also how she chooses to look or wear her makeup. Whoever wrote or said for her to get rid of her makeup is an IDIOT. I can't stand people like that."
5,Very cute chair for the kids!,This came in a box with easy removal and the kids loved them! good quality chair with easy clean up for spills! ---sunshinemacaroni
1,rocker chair,"he really enjoyed his couch and help us not to hurt himself trying to sit on the big couch,"
4,Armchair,"This armchair is not upholstered with a chenille fabric. It is a ""stringy"" terrycloth. It does pull, etc. However; my daughter does sit in it to watch TV and get cozy. She loves her chair. I was the only one disappointed with the fabric of this chair as I thought it was a true chenille."
4,Great chair,"We bought this for our 2 year old. He loves it. It is well-built and sturdy and looks like it could withstand years of sitting and moving. I do have a few minor issues:* the fabric stains easily, and when my son dribbled some water on the chair, it created a white splotch that we have not been able to remove.* the chair is promoted as a rocker, however, it really doesn't rock all that much (which in hindsight is probably a good thing).Overall, a great product from KidKraft."
4,60 Day Slimdown (post-natal workouts),"I think this a great set for the new mom who wants to start getting her body back into shape. With 4 DVD's, there is a great amount of variety to keep you from getting bored. The program details what exercise(s) to do each day. The rest of the program info involves nutrition & tracking your progress.You will need 2 sets of weights - (probably 3 lbs and 5 lbs if you are new to exercise) and I think it's helpful to have a lightweight exercise ball for the Core Metabolic Jumpstart DVD (but a light weight can be used instead).I like the overall tone of the workouts. I found Lindsay to be a bit too perky at first, but she is upbeat & motivates me to finish each exercise which is what really matters. I feel like you can get a great workout in each time if you put in the effort. This is great for beginners to more advanced exercisers. It has been my go-to workout program since my 2nd child was born & I'm glad that I purchased it!"
5,Great husky plush!,"Even though the tail doesn't have the full husky curl, it's easily ammended with a little stitch in the right spot.Makes a wonderful gift for any husky lover!Absolutely soft and cuddlable! You will have to give it a brush first to straiten out the tail fur before giving it as a gift to anyone, but other then that it's cuddly and beautiful."
5,Great Yard Tool,The recondition lawn edger came looking new. and its backup by a two year waranty by Black& Decker. will reconsider buying other products like this
4,Works well at a good price,"Very impressive. My lawn is heavy clay but this edger goes right through it. Trenching ability was also excellent. Clearly the item has been used by a prior owner....but reconditioning seems to restore the mechanics to new condition. At this price, you really can't go wrong."
2,Dated,"I don't recall if I saw this when it came out. I probably did because I loved Paris, Shirley MacLaine and Billy Wilder. What a difference a half-century makes.When I watched it now I was terribly disappointed. The Jack Lemmon character was silly, the whole premise was naive and it just didn't grab me. I hate to say it but I was also offended by the old timey view of prostitutes as good-time girls who really loved their work. I'm not politically correct or even much of a feminist, but I found portraying prostitutes in this way really offensice. There is nothing funny or entertaining or cute about prostitution and the women who endure this terribly degrading 'profession"" sure don't look like Shirly MacLaine. I turned it off after about 20 minutes. Maybe it got better? I'll never know. I probably did see this and enjoy it fifty years ago; I know better now."
4,Green Stocking Diaries,"One character in ""Irma La Douce"" describes the love between Jack Lemmon's sad sack and Shirley MacLaine's heart-of-gold streetwalker as ""cute"". Herein lies my problem with the film. I liked it, though it was a little overlong, but I was expecting something a little edgier from director Billy Wilder and his co-scenarist I.A.L. Diamond. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they were adapting someone else's work instead of creating something original. Lemmon and MacLaine still have that distinct chemistry but it's not as apparent as it was in Wilder's masterwork, ""The Apartment"". One pronounced credit to the film is the hilarious turn by Lou Jacobi as Moustache, Lemmon's mentor and dispenser of advise. Not a bad film but I would behoove you to check out Jules Dassin's ""Never on Sunday"" with Melina Mercouri which covers similar territory as ""Irma La Douce"" but with infinitely better results."
5,An Honorable Defeat: The last Days of the Confederate Government,The book is a gift to someone. I was very pleased with it's appearence as it looked brand new. It arrived very promptly and in good condition. Thank you.
1,A Dishonorable Feat,"This, quite simply, is a bad book. The scholarship is slippery at best and brazenly poor in many instances. It's a curious little exercise -- Civil War meets the mood ring. While it is not surprising to find CW Battles and Leaders-like character feuding occuring in 2001 (Davis v. Breckinridge, Lee v. Breckinridge, Lord! Breckinridge v. Breckinridge!!), it is surprising to discover not-so-veiled homophobia (the bit about Benjamin) and anti-semitism (the other bit about Benjamin) so prominently featured. Oh, Benjamin was fat and told jokes too, and smiled too much, and ate ham, and was rich. What is the point? Breckinridge, having been Vice President of the United States, led men to kill men defending that entity. This is worthy? I love a good yarn, but Breckinridge the hero? Not for me."
2,Season 2 Needs More Seasoning,"I have to say I'm quite surprised at the accolades over season 2. Anthony LaPaglia is a fine enough actor in his own right but Benzali he ain't!!! The understated Benzali in my opinion WAS season one. Check out the Special Features of the season one DVD and watch DB get misty over the character...priceless!Although I was hoping I'd get caught up in the follow on, I wasn't. I respect those who are enjoying the next chapter, it just wasn't for me."
1,No Benzali...Completely Different Show,"Season One was Brilliant. While the supporting cast remained the same, the show was never close to the original.A real disappoint in comparison. Not bad but it's like comparing a tricycle to a BMW. I guess they'll both get you there but there is a real difference in the ride.Buy Season One."
1,Not very good,"I only received part of my order, so I was very disappointed. I hope to find the complete 2nd season."
4,"plus: great color, minus: uses velcro","The blue color looks darker and more sophisticated than as displayed on the monitor, it's actually called ""Midnight"" instead of just ""blue"". It's way better than I've expected. I guarantee that you would feel the same too. The overall design is very modern, in terms of materials used and shape. It's very compact, not as bulky as the picture made me felt it was. The minus goes to the usage of velcro. If Incase can use some sort of elastic bands to wrap around the PDA in place, it would be perfect. But this may result in larger dimensions in return, and it's just my personal opinion. Overall, this is a great case with great cusioning, color, material, and a fair price. I highly recommend it."
3,A semi-recommended source,"The best thing that can be said about this book is that it exists; it's the only thing of its kind short of the Complete Peerage. The worst thing that can be said about it is almost everything else. The 1883 edition, with its supplement, picks up all those titles which had died out and therefore were not in the later editions of Burke's Peerage. Arrangement is by family name, rather than by title, so one does get a sense of the power the great families accumulated. The amount of narrative detail varies from almost nonexistant to extended Victorian hyperbole, dates are very spotty, and minor factual errors are rife. So use this to outline the rise and decline of a family and its branches, and then go to the Complete Peerage for reliable details."
2,"Nasty smell, burns your nose","I would highly recommend Stomahesive powder over Karaya powder. The smell wafts into your nose and not only does it burn but it is not a pleasant smell. You think it's a good deal for 2.5 oz of ostomy powder but it is not. Stomahesive is 1oz, but it is a much better product."
4,my floss piranha,"i wish his teeth were a little sharper - sometimes he shreds up my floss instead of cutting me a piece, but i don't care, because he is adorable, and i love sharing my countertop with him!"
2,Shows Potential,"Eric Church shows alot of potential on his first major label debut Sinners Like Me. Unfortunatly though, this record seems to be all over the place. It's almost as if Church has no idea what he wants to be. Some of these songs are molded in the vein of contemporary country (think keith urban or rascal flatts), while others are more ""traditional"" (think stuff that doesn't get played on your local hot country station). Even still, most of these songs add a southern rock vibe, which throws everything off all together. Now, none of this would be bad if Church could actually pull it off, but more often than not, he can't. Lyrically, the material here is pretty strong, but lyrics alone can't make an entire song. Hopefully Church will come out with something a bit more focused next time around."
5,A Golfer's Fantasy,I had invited my husband's golf buddies over to celebrate his birthday and gave his this book as a gift. The golfers spent quite awhile looking at the pictures and making comments about the difficulty of the shots and wishing they were playing the courses the holes were on. It provided a lot of fun for them during the party. The pictures are great and really depict what the book is all about.
2,Purple Shampoo,"I bought this product at Walmart and so glad I did because I only wasted 3 dollars. I didn't mind the smell, but it did considerable damage to my hair, making it dry and brittle as others have mentioned. As far as toning down the gold brass in my hair, I can't say it did anything remarkable to help this. It seems like there is a bit more ash in some areas and the gold has faded, but it is nowhere as effective as I thought it would be. I guess I should use it a few more times, but considering I have long and fine hair, I'm afraid to do any more damage. It left my hair with the worst texture ever. I've had hair dye that was less damaging."
1,Purple sludge giving a three-day stink ...,"That's harder to get rid of than skunk, and almost as bad! No kidding -- made my hair smell like institutional floor cleaner mixed with sour clogged-drain odor, which you could smell at 10 yards away and lingered when I left the room. Scrubbed my hair with other shampoos for three days before a even small dent could be made in the odor, and to top it off, just one application of this essence de fishbait also left my hair looking like brittle straw covered with a film of old wax.Bought this as part of my search for something to replace the much-missed Silver Expression shampoo which recently stopped being produced. The search must continue ... I regret to say that somehow I accidentally bought two bottles of this junk, which is definitely like the old joke about first prize is a weekend in Cleveland, second prize is 2 weeks in Cleveland ... do yourself a favor, folks: learn from my mistake and save your money."
1,Shimmer Lights is better!,"i bought this shampoo for my blonde highlighted hair after reading all of the glowing reviews. however, after i used it for about a month i realized that my hair was yellow and i thought i needed to get my highlights touched up. then i realized that it was the shampoo! i immediately ordered Shimmer Lights and WOW my hair looks awesome. it got rid of all of the brassiness that this shampoo allowed my hair to acquire. my hair is now back to it's ashy blonde hue that i love. get Shimmer Lights instead if you have blonde highlights!"
1,Not as good as nexxus simply silver,"I ordered this because it had good reviews but tried it and it doesn't do the job toning down brassiness. I have used simply silver by nexxus and it worked but i was out and ordered jhirmack silver brightening shampoo. You can find simply silver cheaper than on amazon, I just bought it from fasham beauty center, on line and with shipping it only came to $16.94."
2,"For Adrienne Barbeau fans, primarily.","Adrienne Barbeau, in tight shirts or low-cut gowns, sometimes running, sometimes wet. Oh, and in one scene for DVD viewers only, bathing in the swamp for some gratuitous topless shots. That, in short, is about all this movie has going for it.Adapted from a DC Comics character, Swamp Thing joins the ranks of comic adaptations that should never have been. On the side of evil is a 2-dimensional evil botanist (Louis Jourdan) and an incompetent band of commandos (David Hess, Nicholas Worth, et al). The hero is a GOOD botanist (Ray Wise) who transforms into the rubber-suited title character (Dick Durock) and is lovesick for Barbeau. They all muck about in the swamp searching for the ultimate glowing green fertilizer.If you have a hankering to see director Wes Craven at his worst or Barbeau's breasts at their best, this is a must-see. There's no other reason to go near it."
2,Slow-starting. Disappointing. TV series is much better.,"It took a good 20 or 30 minutes for this movie to really get going. The premise is interesting; however, the execution is poor. There's even a scene where the female lead just can't handle the shock and faints. The TV series is much better."
2,Greed,This Movie Is Worth About $10.00 Any one who would pay more than that is just plain stupid.I was going to purchase it so mychildren could watch A funny B movie I enjoyed from the 80s.ButIt's not going to happen the greed mongers have surfaced.Do notpurchase this movie at this time. The rumor is it's going to bereleased again in late 2004.I was off a little but will be released 9-20-05 can get at wal-mart for $10.37
1,ghastly,The plot is moderately interesting but the writing is too contrived. It reads like a Regency romance novel with literary asperations.
2,A Little Ridiculous,"This book tends to take the most simple sentence and turn it into a long, winded embellishment that sometimes makes the story hard to follow. The actual plot of the story is ok, a little ridiculous and outlandish, but entertaining.Amy has a crush on THE most beautiful and popular movie star of the day and it just so happens they meet through mutual friends, become involved and fall madly in love. The ups and downs along with the story are of course paparazzi and an infamous sex tape scandal from a previous relationship. It's all a little little too cliché and expected, but does the trick entertainment-wise."
3,This is a good one...,"I really liked Love: a User's Guide. I'll start off by saying that though the basic story line of single and looking for love is very ordinary, the lives the characters in this book live are not. People don't take exotic weekend vacations and are not surrounded by celebrities on a normal basis. Other than that, it's great! Really, it's a fun escape from the far-too-realistic books I've been reading. The story line here moves quickly, making it a light and easy read. You'll find yourself hoping that Amy, the main character, wins the respect we all deserve as lowly entry-level executives and finds her dream guy. Finally, this is a story where the beautiful, self-admiring male doesn't end up the womanizing monster other authors write about. That's right, normal looking women can win those men over too!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Someone needs to inject a little reality among all the rave reviews on this page. This is a horrible book, a muddled mess. Its biggest problem is Amy, possibly the world's most shallow, unlikeable heroine, who truly doesn't deserve the happy ending she receives. The charming hero (the one saving grace of the book) is so appealing one wonders what he could possibly see in a twit like Amy. Plus, the book sometimes steps back and takes a detached, omniscient-narrator tone that is supremely irritating and simply doesn't work. Worst of all, the book isn't funny at all, although it tries valiantly to be.I realize that not every piece of literature needs to be deeply meaningful, but it should at least be well written and somewhat convincing. This book fails on both counts, and on many others. Avoid it unless you're in the mood for a less-straightforward version of a Harlequin romance."
2,Next!,"This book was totally unbelievable, and I mean that in the bad way. The only reason I read it was because of the wonderful reviews, and I was very disappointed. Of course, I wasn't expecting too much from a book with a cartoon drawing on the cover, but I didn't think it would be written for a 12-year old reading level either. I'm giving it two stars because somehow, I managed to finish it."
1,Chore to read,"Yes, the old adage rings true here: never judge a book by its cover. That was my mistake, because it sounded quite good when I read the back. I was looking for something light and fun. But the entire book is so disjointed. Many times I found myself going back to re-read a sentence that was so awkwardly structured, you couldn't figure it out the first time. It really reads like a first draft that hasn't been edited. A pity, because it could be a charming (even if somewhat fluffy) tale to read.Another word of warning...there are LOTS of references to British Lit, so if you're not familiar with writers from Keats to Enid Blyton, you may not pick up on some of the attempted jokes."
3,I'm Sorry Little Critter,I'm Sorry is a good book because it teaches children to say their sorry when they do something wrong. Even though it might be an accident the little critter still tells you to say sorry. Sorry can make a person feel better if you hurt them or something they owned. That is why if you have a little kid who doesn't say sorry this is the book that will teach them why it's good to say your sorry.
2,Over Priced,"I got got the medium, and found it was way to small for just the basic. (Canon 30d, bat/vert grip, 2 lens and flash) So I returned it. I was checking out this one (large) larger then needed but the cost at 260 USD is way out of site for this bag.The camera compt. needs to be re-designed stronger velco and more of is needed.Looks and color is a 10 star, but functionalty is 3 Star, price is a 1 star.The medium is $150 USD amd the large is $260 USD maybe they need one in between the Medium and Large?So I'm still on the hunt of a good bag that fits me."
3,Could be better,I purchased this bag along with a Kata R-106 to compare. I thought the construction of the NG to be somewhat flimsy especially the zipper for the camera compartment and the padding in the camera compartment.
5,Not just the usual bio!,"Linda Hogan tells a beautiful story of pain, love, life and healing. Literally, weaving her life story together, a story that anyone can relate to comes to the surface. This book is not just ""another biography"" told so that people can sympathize and feel sorry for the author. Instead, it is one of those rare books that pulls you into the authors' life and teaches you something about yourself.Sometimes detached from herself, Hogan lets you into her life, her pain and makes you realize that pain and hurt is not always what breaks you, but is what makes you stronger. A fine, beautiful book and a definate must read."
1,Is the Bible Gay Friendly?,"This book does serve as an excellent introduction to pro-gay theology. However, CAREFUL examination of the ""evidence"" presented by Kader shows that the Bible is not ""Gay Friendly"".The author is dishonest, in that on more than one occasion, he fails to provide the reader with the complete rendering of sources he sites or changes the context of sources (including the Bible) to suit the argument he is trying to make. These tactics indicate that the author is fabricating evidence for the point of view he espouses, rather than presenting and considering all of the evidence available to draw a conclusion.Let the reader beware!"
3,GOTTA WATCH THOSE DVD TRANSFERS,"I HAVE LONG BEEN WANTING A DECENT COPY OF THIS MOVIE, MY ONLY ONE BEING A SLOW SPEED VHS DUPE, WHEN I FOUND THIS RELEASE FROM THE NETHERLANDS. THE MOVIE SEEMS TO BE INTACT, ALTHOUGH MY OLD COPY RUNS 111 MINUTES, BUT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM A VHS COPY, THE PICTURE QUALITY IS PRETTY FUZZY. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MANAGED THE SUBTITLE ON/OFF OPTION IF IT WAS A VHS TRANSFER, BUT THIS COPY OBVIOUSLY NEVER GOT NEAR A PIECE OF FILM, THE VISUALS ARE JUST THAT SOFT.THAT SAID HOWEVER, THE MOVIE IS UNIQUELY WORTH SEEING, EVEN IF THIS IS THE ONLY VERSION ON DISC AVAILABLE TODAY. ALTHOUGH SCARING UP A TAPE COPY WOULD PROBABLY SERVE JUST AS WELL."
5,wet saw,THIS SAW IS AWLSOME. IT CAME FULLY PACKED AND WAS EASY TO ASSEMBLE. GREAT PRICE TOO.I LIKED THE FREE SHIPPING
4,Inexpensive alternative to Azelex,"This has 20% azelaic acid in it - same as the prescription brand Azelex. Azelex was $60 for me (for 30g), even with decent insurance. The inactive ingredients are different, and this doesn't go on quite as smooth, but I would swear it actually worked better for me, but that might be only because I'm more liberal with it, since every gram doesn't cost $2.My dermatologist was fine with me continuing to use this on top of the new prescription he wrote me for Epiduo. The two of them are working together fine.I like it because it's a natural product and because it's OTC, so I don't have to wait in line at the pharmacy and shell out the big bucks. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't come sealed, but somehow I think you'd know if it had been tampered with."
5,great,working well for my wife body. it has saved us fro goung to the doctor for treatment. great job for purchasing it
1,They Suck,"These were not what I expected, I suppose it should be a buyers beware when you buy a picture. They did not fit my ear buds and forcing them on was an issue."
4,Good,They are pretty good and they fit all the sizes I needed them for. I received them when I expected and they have good quality
1,poor quality,"these were described as fitting skullcandy however they do not, very poor quality flimsy, since they did not fit my buds i didn't try them for sound quality, i don't think they would stay in the ear..."
5,Very handy and durable,"I needed this precision screwdriver set to change the RAM in my laptop. I loved the free twisting end so you can stabilize the end with one hand and with the other you can just twist the handle to unscrew/screw the small screws.The handle seems durable but the extending end needs to be tightened with good force when it is extended otherwise if you put too much pressure on the screw the extension will be pushed back into the handle. I learned to tighten more the part that secures the extension and also to decrease the pressure I put on the screws. That took care of the above problem.I may get more adventurous and change some other components of the laptop because of this tool set!UPDATE: (10/09/09) - I changed the HDD of my Macbook Pro and this set helped beautifully. Actually it was pretty neat to go through the ""bowels"" of my computer and see the intracacies of an Apple laptop."
4,Good product. Could use a little more engineering.,"This is a good product and seems to be of good quality. The inner lining is thin plastic and doesn't hold the bits in place at all. If you turn it over, all the bits fall out. A little tab on each side of the bit holders would keep the in place for the most part. Now, a light bump starts a minor panic attack that the bits are going to fly out. still recommend. The actual driver is top notch. Has an extension and the swivel end allowing the user to apply pressure where it matters most and still turn the driver easily."
5,Awesome,"Love this movie. Great fun, and good acting... even from Will Ferrel and Brad Pitt. My little girls love it even more than I do."
4,Another fun Dreamworks title,"While I don't think that any of the Dreamworks titles hold up to Pixar's efforts (except for How to Train Your Dragon), they continue to put out fun titles that parents and kids can enjoy. Megamind is no exception. It's a fun take on the superhero genre. The Blu-Ray quality is there, but it's also nice to have the DVD to take on trips. It would have been nice to have the digital copy as well, but I cannot complain with the value. Very happy with the purchase."
5,Fun for the whole family!,I bought this movie for my two sons: age 9 & age 2. They both love it but my husband and I do as well. There are lots of recognizable celebrity voices and there are funny parts for adults too! We all really enjoy this movie!
1,What a rip-off!,"I love the Megamind movie. It is one of my favorites. However, I bought this ""double-pack"" for twice the price I would have paid to buy the original movie, thinking the second one was a full length sequel to the first. The second ""movie"" is about 15 minutes long and looks like maybe it was meant to be part of the ""special features"" on the original movie. At any rate, I will be returning this ""Double Pack"" and buying the movie for half the price. I believe this is false advertising, people!!"
2,BluRay disc defective,"The blu-ray disc was defective and i returned. the player could never go to the menu...screen went black after ""loading""i returned for refund.2 stars because Amazon was gracious and expeditious in the return and refund."
5,What's with the 1 star ratings?,"I really like this movie (watched it in the theater) and I will probably buy it. But I wanted to point out that several people are giving this a 1 star rating apparently because they ""feel"" the original came out in 3D and the DVD should also come out in 3D. Let me point out that the original came out in BOTH 3D and regular versions, and the first time I watched it, I did not see the 3D version. Sure if you want to wait for a 3D version go ahead, but it's not right for a lot of people to presume that a DVD is a specific format then give it a low rating for being something else."
3,Average,"Seeing this movie reminded me of how I feel about animated movies. They're okay, and now and again they're really great. But most of the time, they're just average. I think that was the same with this movie. For an animated movie, the plot was very clever and had a good twist to it. But it also had the same events that other animated movies have: the hero (or in this case, the villain) goes wrong, realizes that this isn't what he wants to do (usually because of loneliness or a romantic interest) and changes himself. I didn't mind this movie, but I don't think it was a must-see. I recommend it for younger kids who are tired of seeing your everyday animated movie with a regular hero in it. They'll love this one because of its new twist on good and evil."
3,plusses and minuses,I purchased this because it had upconverting for much lower price than competitors. But it sure seems underpowered at 90W per channel. I had a ten year old 100W per channel Sony receiver and it was way more powerful. so that's a disappointment. Wish I had gotten the 705 or 805 model.has a 60 hz buzz on the woofer that I have not been able to get rid of.Customer support from Onkyo was good.
2,Limitations,"The HDMI upconvert, does not give the best picture. Component video ends up working better, so I would seek other features in this price range, such as more connectivity. Quality video conversion comes at a higher price. If you're using component video, the instant status displays (volume adjustments, sound modes, etc.) don't come thru. So, although the receiver has all the latest features, they don't really work well yet. Onkyo Tech Support was no help and even seemed annoyed that someone would call them."
3,Good but not great,"I bought my TX-SR605 about a year ago. I also loved it until last week when my hdmi inputs stopped working. I contacted Onkyo regarding warranty work but they were very specific that the receiver would have to be sent in its original package, which i did not have any longer. So now I am stuck with a receiver that has no working hdmi inputs or outputs. No working hdmi ports means no HD sound. So now I'm back to just having a regular receiver. Do not buy this receiver. Personally I would have bought a Sony like I have in the past. I bought this receiver because they were the first on the market to offer the new HD sound formats."
1,"Consider something else, do not fall into trap for hdmi upconversion","I brought this last month, and my experience is that there are lot better out there compair to this one. Reasons i am saying is below. My preferance is Harman.1> Sound quality is no better than $100 receiver.2> HDMI upconversion converts to 480p only, you will not see any difference at all. And in somecases even worst but never better. Same price receiver can do 1080i upconversion.3> I had problem with certain decoding like dts and dolby didn't work in most of the times for all speaker. (I am not sure what was wrong but never had this problem with harman)4> For no reason sometime it will stop sending video signal for few seconds."
4,Needs a better FM receiver,"I have this receiver hooked up to a 7.1 surround system, and it works great. I used the included microphone to automatically adjust the speaker volume levels but, I didn't quite agree with the chosen levels, so I manually went in and adjusted them. I would have given this receiver five stars, except for the fact that the FM receiver doesn't pick up anything but extremely close stations. I live approximately 50 miles from most major stations, but to have several FM receivers that can pick up the FM stations very well. The only way this receiver will work for listening to FM stations will be if I hook it to an external antenna."
2,Not Happy,"I knew it was a lower level receiver, but I figured with all the bells and whistles it was worth a shot. It's packed with goodies and fairly easy set-up. After a couple of days hooked up to my older Yamaha towers(8ohm) I tried to air it out a little. It broke my heart. At just over half it kept shutting down into protect mode. It was not even getting a chance to overheat. It was sitting on the floor out in the open and it couldn't keep up. I wasn't trying to rattle the windows and it would repeatedly shut down. I sent it back and stepped up to a Marantz and haven't looked back."
2,"Denon 1908 betters the Onkyo 605, easily","This is dedicated to all the people who are distressed over their 605's, & to people contemplating a receiver in this level.The Denon AVR-1908."
5,Love That Onkyo!,"My sister needed a 7.1 A/V receiver for her new home theater room and this one is perfect for her needs.She wanted to spend $300 and this was less. This is excellent quality at a budget price point, though not for a novice to set up; like her. I set it up for her. Gotta love me!"
4,This is one hot receiver!,"I have been very happy so far with this receiver. The various listening modes are great, it has a healthy number of input/outputs, and it was relatively easy to set-up. The only fault I can find with my Onkyo receiver to this point is that it really runs very hot. Even just sitting in standby mode it is quite warm, and after a couple of hours of sound decoding, putting your hand on it is very unpleasant. You will half-expect it melt into AVR soup. I have found no indication that this in any way impacts performance, though, you may be most comfortable if you're able to put the receiver in a very well ventilated place. I would definitely recommend this product, the price/performance margin is very favorable."
4,"First Onkyo, but not the last",This is my first Onkyo product and I am very pleased. Setup was a breeze and the sound quality is first rate. Gotta love it!!!
2,pamphlet,"This appeared to be a bunch of magazine articles cut and paste into a short book. There was no reasoning, progression, or consistency to their plan. It did contain a variety of exercises though but no plan. I thinkYou Are Your Own Gym: The Bible of Bodyweight Exercises for Men and Womenis a much better alternative."
3,"Ok, but not close to great.","I don't know what it is, but I just don't get into this book. I will pick up my Pavel kettlebell or Bobby Clark book over this one any day. It has some different stuff, but other books are much more interesting and seem to be more hard core than this one. Oh and for some background.... I haven't been into the gym weight lifting for many years. I prefer bodyweight and a now kettlebell exercises because you really get everything working together unlike many weightlifting exercises which isolate."
3,Beginner's Bible,Not A BAD BOOK FOR BEGINNERS. DOESN'T OFFER MUCH FOR ADVANCED BODYBUILDERS.STILL SOME OF THE EXERCISES ARE USEFUL FOR ALL LEVELS OF BODY BUILDERS
5,Gives you an insider's view of the political mind.,"The mystery of it keeps you in doubt until the very last page, but the best thing about this book is that it gives you an insider's view of what really goes on in a politician's mind."
3,"3.5 stars - Good, but not great.","I'd not read Tapply prior to this but didn't feel lost in the series. I very much enjoyed the characters, the fact that Coyne is ethical, and the fact that we didn't spend any time in the courtroom. The sense of place and dialogue were excellent. I knew who the killers were very early into the story but not the motive behind it all, and there was a good twist at the end. While I didn't find it and outstanding read, I certainly enjoyed it enough to give others in the series a try."
3,"Functional, reliable, but bulky and big","From photos of this , I thought it would be so much smaller. It is very sturdy and functional. I wanted it for my walk-in closet to reach the top shelves and it works fine but I have had to make room to store it, even though it flips shut. The 3 is for not realizing or understanding how bulky it is."
1,Wont play,It arraived in time but when i play wont start not even in my laptop. So i returned it. The service was great.
5,Stetson Half Dome Wool Hat,The hat was as expected and I am very pleased with the product. It's fits well and really looks good. I highly recommend it for value for money.
2,Comfortable but not durable,"I bought this model when it first came out. It worked pretty good for about 2 years. It was ergonomic and comfortable, but the trigger started leaking and I could not find any one local to repair it. I sent it to the Dewalt repair center and it cost $135.00 to repair. I think I will go back to Hitachi nail gun or maybe try Max nail guns.Follow up on this review after still having a problem with the trigger I took it once more and to my suprise Dewalt gave me a brand new gun. (Dewalt, you're O.K.) They took the old gun back, that I used almost every day for two years, for evaluation to improve their guns in the future. It's been about six mounths and this gun seems to be working well. My only complaint now is that the six position depth is not a fine enough adjustment for the perfect depth; one doesn't set them deep enough, the other is too deep."
3,Banzai Falls Slingshot,"Kids love the toy, but slip n' slide water hose busted after a few hours. Water will not shoot up from slip n' slide hose to water down the slide. Body board popped pretty early, but was to be expected. Extra body boards I bought also didn't last very long. Overall, the blowup side of slide is still usuable, but will have to get a new slip n' slide for future use."
4,A minor triumph,"Though a little paternalistic, this is a baseball book I pick up every few seasons. Roger Kahn follows the fortunes of the Utica Blue Sox and makes you care about the results of the 1983 New York Penn League Class A championship. The relationships in this book work, because they are frankly about work. Anybody who has been forced into tight living, or working quarters with a group who share skills, if not temprament can relate to the players, management and hangers-on who populate this rich story. The life lessons go down easy, the epiphanies are done lightly, the love of the game shines brightly. The title, spoken by a minor member of the minor league team, is another of this sweet stories many hits"
4,Great read and very surprising ending!,I found this book to be a very quick read and very enjoying with a different perspective than many other novels I've read. It is surprising how sometimes an uncomplicated novel can be so refreshing. Well worth the few hours spent!
4,Great read,I really enjoyed this book. The author took the time to develop the characters in the piece. Good insight into depression era life and coal mining.
5,Excellent and moving read,"The beautiful, rich relationships offered a glimpse of a time when family got one through hard times. i read his book through the night as i wanted to stay with Hattie to a happy ending. Great read!!!@"
4,Turn back is what it is.,"Very interesting read. The story flows very well. It covers so much territory that I don't even begin to know how to share but I can tell you this, it takes time to really read this and enjoy it. I liked it. Love, a very strange and complicated emotion."
5,Great Music!!,"This CD is great! I love the way I can find all my CDs on Amazon! Thanks Amazon, for another terrific CD full of great music!"
2,Not suitable for photos,I tried 2 of these-- both made horrible lines through my photos. I wouldn't recommend it if that's what you want to scan. It's ok for b&w documents.
5,Join With Me In Yesteryear.....,"Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaaaayyyy!Are you old enough to recall being glued to your TV set watching the Lone Ranger? Are you even older, and remember listening on the radio? Are you younger, and always wondered what the older folks meant by Hi-Yo Silver?Here's your chance to re-live those days, or live them again for the first time!Nobody ever said the acting was stellar, but some of it ain't bad, and that's besides the point. This is the ORIGINAL Lone Ranger TV series, the first, the making of, and the masking of, the origin of the Masked Man who brought Law and Order to the Old West.You didn't think it happened in New York City didja?Thrill as the anticipated massacre occurs, feel for the Rangers, glory in the telling of the survivor's recovery in Tonto's care, see how he came to be called ""Kemosabe"", join with me now as the LONE RANGER RIDES AGAIN!Now how can you pass that up?"
3,Awkward,Seems to ride too high for me. The knockouts I removed were the highest so the ride height will be even higher on thinner belts. The retention is fine. I would not buy this again and instead go with a similar leather holster. For the price and retention I give it a 3 star.-Jeepin Jesse
1,glock holster,I personaly do not like this holster. it fits so tight that when i recieved the product i put my glock 26 into it and thought that i was going to have to cut the holster to get my gun out. even after heat molding the holster as well as taking a dremel tool to it..... it still fits to tightly. even my glock 17 fits to tightly for my taste. I would not recommend this product.
3,Not for logic problem aficionados,"True fans of logic problems will not enjoy this book. The puzzles aren't particularly challenging, most of the solving grids aren't set up properly, and there are numerous errors. I find the problems to be like those found on fifth grade homework. I was expecting something akin to those found in the Penny Press logic puzzle magazines, but this was not so. To the publisher: correct the mistakes before your next printing!"
2,No worldwide voltage support,Please be aware of misleading product description - it does not include worldwide voltage support.
4,Good product for the money. Minor improvements maybe?,"I had purchased this shaver to replace my old panasonic, because I fried my charger for the old one in Spain. The shaver works good with the triple blade, and very good for wet shave. The only thing I didn't like was that the AC charger is big and bulky, so it's not very good for travellers, and I prefer my old Panasonic's Linear motor charger type compared to this one's two prong exposed pin socket. The linear motor type is completely sealed, and you just let the shaver sit on the flat surface of the charger. Totally sealed from water. The only other thing I didn't like about this new one is that if I have the shaver screen off to dry the blade components, it doesn't rest well on the surface due to the ergonomic shape of the shaver."
4,Panasonic Pro Curve Shaver,"I bought this for my husband as a replacement for his other razor. He likes it but wishes the speed were a bit faster since his beard is very heavy. It does cut well and charges fine. He also likes to take it into the shower with him. All in all, he would buy another one if given the opportunity. The one negative which is why I only gave 4 stars is how expensive it is to replace the blades and the foil. They cost SO much, it probably makes more sense to just buy a new razor."
3,Not bad,"Except some unbelievable scenarios. For instance: The cop breaks a few rules to remove a renowned serial killer from jail one night by forging a signature. Then, alone, escorts the serial killer deep into the woods with no backup. Hmmm. We're halfway through the book... I wonder what will happen?? The killer escapes, (a gimme), starts a fire which leads to massive forest fires and the death of a homeless man AND he then kills again. This time, it's the heroine's sister. There is no mention that the heroine is upset with him at all about this???? She's just glad to see him at the funeral. ??? After 6 months of the killer being on the loose, the cop finally catches the guy and is regarded as a real 'hero' by the other cops and retires with much dignity. Uh huh.And why is the park full of so many mommies with their children, even slathering sunscreen on them, at 6:50 in the morning?"
1,Petite post it,This is not a standard size post-it. Very expensive for little notes. Not a good buy.
1,Very small,"It is mini not the original one in the picture it is big but when it is arrived not what I want it is really disappointing for me, I really hate that not very useful for me"
2,convenience-vs-comfort,"The shoes are very cute, very comfortable, but not very easy to put on, I almost feel like I should have ordered a bigger size maybe. I probably will never end up wearing them, they are that difficult, so I look at it like I wasted money.I probably could have returned them but the hassle is not worth it.I will not order shoes on-line again."
5,The BEST book on probate in California,"If you can only purchase one book on probate in California, this book should be your first stop. I am in the process of probating my mother's estate and I will save at least $20,000 by using this book. There a dozens of forms, tips and tons of information on the subject. If you are motivated and organzed, this is the guide to help you avoid the high cost of attorneys in probate. I cannot urge you STRONGLY enough to use this book as your guide to probate in California."
5,Thorough and helpful,This book answered all my questions. It is written very thoroughly and with all the information necessary to settle an estate on my own! I highly recommend it to anyone.
3,How to Probate and Estate in California,"I was pointed to this book by The Executor's Guide, also a NOLO publication. However, the How to Probate book had no information about settling an AB Living Trust. AB Trust is not even in the book's index. I did find one form in the back of the book that I will use, just to dull the sting of buying a book that was almost useless to me. I should have read more about this book before ordering it."
5,Ecellent book for anyone!,"After my dad passed suddenly I found out that it was going to cost thousands of dollars to get my dad's land in my name, this book has every detail in a very easy format. I have no law background, I am a Biologist, but with this book I am able to do it all myself, no lawyer needed. thank you!"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"For anyone who had a chance to see the original production or televised version of the same, this is absolutely horrific! It was as though this production was thrown together quickly and haphazardly. It had seemingly no direction. What was forgotten in this production is that this glorious, brave, daring work is not merely a genius piece of music but it is also a brilliant piece of ""theatre"" of drama. In this, the performers seemed to have no idea of who their characters were or why they were singing (except for Anika Noni Rose). The director didn't seem to know that this was a piece about faith and doubt and worldliness and choice. It questions who is God, what is the Church, how does it all fit into our daily lives as we struggle here on earth. What it means to believe in ones religion and be a part of the world. In fact there was no direction. What a complete disservice to Mr. Bernstein and to JFK in whose honor it was originally written."
3,I'll second what most of the others have said,"I consider the Bernstein Mass to be the most important piece of classical music since Puccini and Strauss were in their prime, and it's much more powerful if you see it rather than just hearing it. The conclusion is especially powerful. However, not having seen it before, I was puzzled by the lack of the broken chalice. I knew what was supposed to happen, and I was wondering why it didn't happen. Thanks to the other reviews, I know what else I missed. If the PBS version is ever released on DVD, I'll buy that one and donate this somewhere."
4,convenient duster,"Great for dusting the soil in my vegetable garden with diatomaceous earth for sowbugs, earwigs, ants and other pests that heavily invade my vegetable growing area.The extension that's provided is kinda whimpy and it's difficult to distribute the powder evenly with it ...so I don't use it. It's made sturdily and I'm hoping to get many years of use from it.I guess the only negative comment I might have is that each time I pump it, it gives off a loud squeak. I don't think I'm suppose to oil it since it may not function if I do, but since there aren't any instructions regarding the squeak, I'll have to put up with the annoying squeal.I've used it on my woodpile, and the DE repelled the spiders, leaf wasps, and other creepy crawlers that usually find a place to hide between the logs."
3,Only fair for the price...and with an annoying squeal.,I hate to have to diss this product but I have to. Yes it's cheap. Yes it does dust plants. But it's very finnicky. The powder has to be bone-dry; no lumps. Also you have to point it UP to get a fine dust cloud. If you point it down your plants will look like a powdered doughnut; white with dust. And then there's the awful squeal that it makes. It's very loud. And the parts appear to have been sonically welded together so there's no way to take it apart and put some grease on the o-ring in the pump. I'm going to get one of those Miser things with the crank and hopper and see if that works. I'll let you know. If I think of a way to break it open and lubricate it I'll let you know that too.
5,Great receiver,"I purchased this receiver as part of a home theater system mainly because of its 7.1 capabilities and auto calibration of the surround speakers. It's a breeze to set up and delivers house shaking base and crystal clear sound. I purchased acoustically matched Infinity speakers for the system. The many options offered by the selectible surround modes make it very easy to taylor the sound to fit the music source, whether it's a move, music DVD or CD. For the price, this receiver is hard to beat."
1,Broke 1 week after 1 year Warranty -$430 wasted!,Multi-channel (Hi-Fi Audio -my favorite feature) broke after 1 week after 1 year warranty was up-a waste of money/time!Don't buy this product unless you have $400+ to throw out the window!
2,Abysmal production of a great musical,"Vanessa Redgrave can't sing - perhaps the song should be ""The Simple Joys of Silence"" instead of ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood"".Franco Nero leaves you cold.Richard Harris, however, is the one, bright, shining moment in this Camelot. TheBroadway Versionwhich he did in '82 is head and shoulders above this."
5,Wonderful Camelot Memories,"When I saw the ad for the Camelot DVD, I was reminded of the wonderful music and beautiful scenery of the movie I had seen over 30 years ago. I assumed when I ordered it that the picture would not be very clear, as it is an older film, so I thought ordering it in Blu-ray would improve it a little. What a pleasant surprise as I watched the Blu-ray copy which provides a wonderful, clear picture! It is hard to believe this is not a current movie!"
2,Didn't survive the test of time,"Growing up, I loved this movie, and I had looked for it ever since. What a disappointment!The songs didn't end.The characters were caricaturely naive.I enjoyed watching Richard Harris, but I liked him better in later films."
4,The King Arthur Legend with song and dance...,"My favorite poetry and legend set to music.Vanessa Redgrave is my idea of beautiful and English:she really doesn't sing as well as maybe she should.I suppose that you can nit pick this about it not having the whole taleor distorting this or that,but this production is just beautiful for all time.If one looks at it as a work of art, the result is successful.I loved it!"
1,Poor customer service from Weber...,"My fiance received this grill ordered from Amazon, and out of the box, the welding was broken. It took a week to get the new piece. Then, we realized that his folks had accidentally given him the natural gas version, not the propane version. To return it, apparently you have to be able to disassemble it, get it back in the original box, and then you're charged a $150 return fee. The fee is bad enough considering what good customers we are for amazon, but the worst part is THIS GRILL IS NEVER GOING TO FIT BACK IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING with the various parts. And Weber doesn't sell conversion kits to change to propane or you risk voiding your warranty. Pretty sad for such a nice grill, that's a back yard plant stand now."
3,Bought for 8-year-old,"We bought this for our 8-year-old daughter for Christmas. She's been able to make three different lipbalms so far. She has had a lot of fun playing with the different flavors. As a parent I am not impressed with this toy. The lipbalm base is very hard to clean up afterwards. It's greasy and doesn't clean up with dishsoap and leaves a messy residue. Also, the lipbalms are really soft after making them. She put them in the freezer to harden them up, which helped, but when they warmed back up, they were runny again. This happened with all three that she's made even though she's had adult supervision making them (so we know they're being made correctly)."
1,Click away before it's too late.,"If you're scouring the internet for a toy that has no value beyond a patentable ability to coat every surface in Vaseline forever, this beautifully boxed migraine is for you. The committee that designed such a thorough nightmare should be subpoenaed and held in confinement until congress can pass a law that denies due process. As if the concept (melting petroleum jelly in a plastic cup of lukewarm tap water then scooping it into a tinier cup with a stick) weren't vapid enough, bottles of food coloring are provided for a fresh level of anguish. To force a drop of liquid from these pesky vessels means power tools. While eager offspring await paltry production of a primary color, know that any wayward release will ""permanently stain."" In fairness, I can't say this product will cause instant death. I'm nonetheless confident the sensation it left on my skin and my psyche will not cease until I am cremated. More satisfying crafts await you and your family."
1,Kind of like Crisco...,"My 5 year old recently received this for her birthday. The kits comes with way more balm than what will actually fit in the containers and the balm is the consistency of Crisco and really lacks any type of flavor other than, well, yucky. Try to find something better if you can...."
1,dont buy this thing,my mom got me this at target when i tried making it the first time i made a big mess in our hotel room we where only in San Fransisco for 2 weeks the balm is not really balm it was sort of a waxish thing and its sticky and disgusting it is so hard to get the balm into the little tins if you do some how get it in the balm will be impossible to get it in neatly DON'T BUY THIS THING
3,Messy,"My 9 year old tried doing this herself and made the comment that it was more difficult then she thought. Washing this product is nearly impossible due to all the grease. You can make 5 lip balms, my daughter on her own made 1 and packed it back up."
1,Icky Mess!,"We got this as a gift, my daughter was so excited with it until we actually started to make it. The bowl, measuring cup and spatula are too small so everything spills or slops out of the containers while mixing. It is very sticky, think lipstick left in your pocket after getting laundered. It gets everywhere and is nearly impossible to get clean. It left such a residue on the little colorful containers that the stickers wouldn't work so we couldn't even decorate them."
5,BEST OF THE BEST PERIOD!,"Powerful 3D Graphics Video Card at a reasonable price. I tried two nVidia GeForce cards prior to this one had had to return both of them. This card does excellent work at Video and 3D graphic.For the price, this card can't be beat. It has the speed, memory and bandwidth throughput for graphic intensive applications and games. There is not an nVidia card at a similar price that is on a similar playing field. I tried two different nVidia cards prior to this one on a new Sony VAIO Desktop. I tried the nVidia 5200 MX 440 and a nVidia 5600 FX - neither one did a good job with video or 3D graphics. The ATI(VisionTek) Radeon 9600 Pro is well worth the price!"
2,decent when it worked,After only 200 nails I had to return the nailer to dewalt for repair. And adidtional cost of $164.00 for repair of failed components. initially the nailer was well made and worked fine until it failed. The question that comes to mind was did I recieve one of the lemons made on a Monday. Of all Dewalt tools i own this one item has given me the most problems. I stand by Dewalt tools and awknowledge that at times one bad one can slip by the inspection process. I will continue to buy Dewalt for thier quality ans service.
4,Pretty Bracelet,"Wow, this is a very pretty bracelet! The picture really doesnt show the detail of the mother of pearl inset. It is a deep craving of the flowers. The band is very nice and is exactly how the picture shows it. I rec'd it much sooner than the expected delivery date and since its a Xmas gift I was very pleased!"
3,Good but less personal,"I loved Joseph's first album: ""Big City Secrets"". The songs and their stripped-down sound appealed to me. His newest effort is the thematic cousin, but is much more polished and produced, without the forays into atonality that marred the first album (one improvement). However, I miss the personal feeling of the first album. This newest effort does not tell the stories of life and pain nearly so well. It is a very good album, and well worth the buying, but I feel it is missing the warmth and personality of the first. But I can't wait for the next one!"
4,Very lengthy,"I bought this for my mother in law, as a gift from my daughter. Her reaction was touched, but also overwhelmed. This book covers all the bases and then some...hopefully she will fill some of it out!"
3,Nice book but not what I was looking for,"I had gone back and forth trying to find the best book to have my parents fill out for my new daughter and I settled on this one. Most of the books are for one individual to fill out. I got confused with all the books I was looking at and purchased this one thinking that it was for both grandparents to fill out together however it is not. It is a nice book and the grandparents are going to try to fill it out jointly, however it is not easily set up for that."
5,Beautiful conversation starter...,"Another animal-inspired design from this great Amazon vendor! The detail is fabulous--from the spiral around the ring, to the wolf heads, to the snake clasp, to the snake-skin links! Fits small to medium wrists, and is appropriate for men or women."
3,pewter wolf bracelet,This is a great bracelet the only problems that i had with is the clasp... as soon as i got it the clasp broke easily i replaced it with a different clasp of my own but it was very inconvenient. all in all its a very nice bracelet however!
2,Statistics Trauma,"Many graduate students in the social sciences (at least in my era) were forced to suffer through this awful text. While in his introduction Hays claims to want to reach the less mathematically inclined with his book, his indecipherable, dense prose has led many graduate students into intensive psychotherapy. Just ask any clinical psychology student of the 60s, 70s, and 80s what they think of this book, and you will hear moans, their heads will shake, and they may even shake involuntarily. I hope that current graduate students in the social sciences are still not being subjected to this Haysian torture device!"
5,answers from scripture for our future,"this is a detailed and well documented book. it can be read with the Bible alongside and suddenly, our present times become very clear. A must read."
5,awesome,this book is very informative. It was very accurate in details pertaining to events in the bible.
5,,"I just finished reading Evans' The American Prophecies and could not put it down. I found it extensively documented, compelling and a must read for Evangelical Christians seeking to make sense of our current world. Contrary to other reviewers I have read, I do not find Evans a man of hate, but someone who is deeply saddened by the world events he has witnessed and feels a moral responsibity to let others know the dangers we face. In doing this he is well-aware of the attacks that will come his way--but our faith demands sacrifice. Ignoring history in the name of political correctness has cost us so much. The tone of some of the negative reviews reveals much fear and confusion about what is happening right now. While Evans may not be correct about where we are in God's timeline (only God knows), he is brave about pointing out the signs--I just hope even one reader benefits from his ""voice crying out in the wilderness."""
5,A must read!,"A true eye opener for those of us who have never been taught the true value and importance of the Jewish people, or their role in the return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Learn for yourself why these special people are still precious in God's sight, and why it is so important that the United States continue to be Israel's ally. God bless you!"
5,"Intelligent Book Based On Fact, History & Prophecies","This book is a great read for people who hold the Bible in high esteem. This book explores the roots of hatred towards the Jewish people by those whom we now know as terrorist (Islamist). It has alot of factual history and interesting facts regarding the Jews early contributions to the United States. For those whom have an understanding of the Bible and biblical prophesy ... it puts forth some very interesting future scenarios. The view of the author is very much based on the Bible past, present and future."
5,Awesome,I am a little over half way thru this book. it has so much information that we as American believers need to know. it is very interesting and easy to read. believers and non-believers as well need to get this book and read it.
4,Most Accurate,"The Bible states that God will bless them that bless Isreal.Gen 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.I believe the United States will be bless when we keep an eye on Isreal and help this renewed country."
3,repent America repent,"A biblical call to be humble and not proudfull and wicked,the evidence is solid,you don,t like america will die in his own sins.you better read this book.rating is 5 not 3"
4,The American Prophecies,"Have followed Michael Evans for many years...he is an annointed man with a special mission. This book is a sober reminder to us of the critical role America plays in both Israel and the unbelieving world. You will not get the balanced truth in the liberal media - as it conveys a slanted and blinded opinion of the true issues in the Middle East. Having traveled in the M.E., I recognize much of the veiled beliefs of the peoples there (and in America).I agree - if liberals express hatred over this, ""it's got to be good news.""In our endeavor to love our neighbor as ourself and see peace in the world and in America, we must embrace the ""Prince of Peace"" - the one who loves Israel most - Jesus."
5,The Truth Shall Set You Free,"Anyone who is a student of history and the Bible will see the truth in ""The American Prophecies"". Michael Evans has written the most comprehensive record of how the Islamic world feels toward the US and Israel. Before I read Evans' book I had read the Caner Brothers book ""Unveiling Islam"". Evans confirms what these two revealed about Muslim beliefs and practices.The Bible of course is very specific about what will happen to anyone who curses Israel and what will happen if you bless Israel. I have had many personal blessings from my proclivity to show mercy and kindness to Israelites.Only those who have their heads burried in the sand will not understand what Michael Evans says is based on fact and history."
1,Hal Lindsay Redux,"As a pastor, this book disturbs me. The primary purpose of the scriptures are not to predict the future, but to deepen our relationship with God.Any baby boomer will remember Hal Lindsay's 'Late Great Planet Earth, in the 70's, which predicted the end of the world by the Soviet Union in 89. When that did not happen, it got revised. Gorbachev as the anti-Christ, the Pope as the anti-christ, books like this get lapped up in any crisis...same during Gulf War 1.And, I happen to agree we need to have close ties with Israel, but we also need to dialogue with the moderate Muslim World as the President is encouraging, otherwise the killing will never stop.Save your money, buy Marcus Borg's ""The Heart of Christianity Instead"""
5,For those who have ears let them hear,"Sometimes it's not easy to accept substantiated fact related to prophecy. Some have been driven away from the truth in some way or the other but it is usually because they themselves have not done sufficient research. When they hear some wacko they accept the wacko as a representative of the thing they themselves do not understand. So, they are driven away from the truth just as it was intended. I recommend that all who read the book, assuming an IQ greater than 50, do some research of their own before they condemn it. You may not be disappointed . . ."
1,The Man or the Myth (half star),"The only prophecy I have for this book is disappointment. The information given in Mike Evans writing may be well received and well written, however I think this author should pay more attention to facts instead of practicing prophecy. I think to compare this addition to a group of well written tabloid stories would be a fair comparison. The book offers only a bit of fact in order hook the reader. If I wanted complete fiction, I would have bought a classic. Don't waste the money on dribble from a self proclaimed prophet. This book, at best, is for entertainment purposes only."
5,The American Prophecies,"This is an excellent book. It is loaded with history and facts. I have heard others criticize this book, but to criticize it you could not have read it nor desire truth. How in honesty do you criticize the truth?"
5,Timely Book,This book opens up some of the long-hidden prophecies about the end times and America's part in them. A must read for anyone wanting to plan for the future.
5,American Prophecies / Right on the Mark!,"I have read many books on Bible Prophecy over the last 25 years. This is the best I have ever read. Concise, to the point, and extremely informative. It is Biblically based and offers the Christian a unique insight into the times we are living in..Right Now. After reading this book a Christian should be even more excited about the Lord's return and want to share that love and expectancy with many others. I wish I could have given this 10 stars!"
5,Too important to ignore,This book tells us in easy to read style and no uncertain terms what the future holds for America. It needs to be read and spread throughout America. It is too important to ignore. Our lives depend on it.
2,Wrong Title,"Mr. Evans book, while well written, is really about his personal view that Bible prophecy centers on Israel. According to Mr. Evans, America's role in prophecy is entirely dependent on its relation to Israel. The book lacks solid Scriptural basis for Mr. Evans choice of the title. The title, `The Israeli Prophecies' would have better represented its content."
5,God's Prophacies,God's prophecies will always be fullfilled. Halalulah!!!!!! For healone is God and his will will always be acomplished.Brenda Davis
5,book review of The American Prophesies,"THIS A VERY FACTUAL AND PACTICAL TREATISE FOR THE DEFENSE OF AMERICA AND THE DEFEAT OF THE MUSLIM TERRIORISTS, INCLUDING THE HOMICIDE BOMBERS. iT IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND SHOWS A VERY CLEAR AND CAREFULLY THOUGHT-OUT PLAN FOR ACHIEVING THE DEFEAT OF THESE TERRIORISTS. WHETHER AMERICA HAS THE NATIONAL RESOLVE TO FOLLOW IT'S CLEARLY DELINIATED STEPS/METHOD REMAINS TO BE SEEN. I fear for my homeland and it's lack of resolve.THIS BOOK WAS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ME,AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE.FRANK P GROSSSAN ANTONIO, Texas"
5,Afraid of truth?,"I read this book because I needed to read something factual after reading the nonsense, romantization and manipulation in DaVinci.Why are so many drawn to the falsehoods in that best seller? I have no clue. But, they are being deluded if they believe that NOVEL is based on fact. It obviously is not!But, I do know that truth can still be found. I beg readers to keep an open mind and pick up a copy of the American Prophecies....it is a read well worth the time."
5,Now I get it,"Now I understand the importance of Israel in this day and age. From the sons of Abraham to George W. Bush, the mystery is now revealed. Now I understand why the sons of Ishmael and the sons of Isaac are at war still today, and why America has reaped blessings and curses from God about how we have dealt with each."
5,The American Prophecies: Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Natio,This book is wonderful!! Very truthful and right on target. Everyone needs to get this book and read it. It will truly enlighten everyone who reads it on many issues in these days we are living.
5,The American Prophecies a wake up call.,This is a page turning book. One that you don't want to put down. It is not a gloom and doom book but rather a book that gives evanglical christians a hope and vision. It is our choice for how our nation will go and if we as christians will stand for what is right.
1,"Don't be usin' your booksmarts on me, buddy","Well, this is for that last reviewer, John Zyerce. There you go spountin' all that booksmart stuff, using logic and stuff. This book ain't for you Cambridge college boys, its for us illiterate Southern bumbkin Christians. We don't want nothin' that upsets our mythologies, and there you go tryin' to make sense out of scripture. Next thing ya know, you'll be trying to convice us that man came from monkeys or sumptin'.We Christians like our scripture like we like our wives: dumb, fat, and drunk. Okay, that didn't make sense, but that don't change nothin'. Don't try to convince me that biblical interpretations of prophesy have changed over the years, cause I gots ma' fingers in ma' ears, and a piece 'o straw in ma' mouth. And that's tha' way I likes it."
1,Rationalizaton,"Another attempt to rationalize the current problem, continue, and exacerbate it, based upon subjective and warped interpretations of the Bible. The more you read, the more the author's arguments weakens, revealing its flaws, biases, and inacurracies."
5,About Time,The New Age Secular Humanists are twisting in their hemp-undies over this and I'm enjoying it. This is a wonderful book that should be read by all Christians who are proud Christians.
2,A must read for every American,"Mr. Evans has given us a keen insight into both past and future for our nation. His close adherence to Scripture, his keen insight into both past and current events, and his obvious love and concern for the United States of America shine through on every page of this book. It is not a knee-jerk reaction to other points of view, but rather, it is a serious look at where this land we love can go, with the help of God and true patriots. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his thesis, it behooves every American who loves this country to read this book with an open mind and prayerful heart."
5,This book has absolutely the best information.,"If you want to understand what is going on between Ishmael (Arab) and Isaac (Israel) read this book, immediately.Kathleen Taggart"
1,Rattlesnakes Constricting In Prayer.,"I was raised in the help the poor Lutheran Ministerial tradition & attended Parochial School. The way this man thinks has nothing to do with Christianity as I learned it. That is ""do unto others . . ."" & ""turn the other cheek"" Christian behavior.This book is the hateful spiel of a renegade snake handler & has more in common with Ouji Boards & Black Magicians then the Gospel of Universal Love & Understanding I learned.It is sad to know how much US Christian thought centers around Apocalyptic death wishes and religious bigotry.This sad, ignorant chimera of misconception is a pitiable excuse for religious thought. Evans mostly avoids Bible quotes, as it requires such exquisite mental gymnastics to make anything anywhere in the Bible conform to his rancid spiel.Typical Fundamentalist Pornography. READ FOR A DAMN GOOD LAUGH!!!"
4,Eye Opener,I have read portions of this book so far and found it very informitive and even surprizing. I believe the insight in this book is very valuable. It's worth checking out for yourself.
5,The American Prophecies:Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Nation,What a powerful and timely message for our nation! It's a must- read for every American!
1,Superstitious nonesense,"Mankind has walked on the moon, but all too many people still intellectually live in the dark ages, still suffering from the ignorance and superstition that prevailed at that time. This book is a blatant example of this.When you believe in things that you don't understand,Then you suffer,Superstition ain't the way.Captain Video"
3,Good for a quick read.,"This series is okay and great for a quick read. But the story is, I don't know, maybe a little to MMMMMM. And it just leaves you thinking ""Am I missing something?"" It's enough to keep you reading the series to see what happens next."
5,Riley St. James has another page turner that's brilliant!!,"What more can I say about this very talented and gifted writer. As his first book, ""Moonglade"", it is a book to be read by all. The storyline and his characters can be identified with so much that one tends to feel they are part of the story and the character. A little anger, fear, suspense, sadness and mystery are sure to be felt by the reader. It grabs you on the first page and your hooked, once again by this writers wonderful talent. Thank you Mr. St. James for sharing your talent with us. I'm patiently waiting for your next page turner."
1,NOT A GERBER!,"I should have read the other reviews....this is NOT A GERBER BRAND KNIFE! It's a ""superknife"". I'm VERY disappointed that Amazon allows this false advertising!"
2,-----------------> FLAG... Not a Gerber!,"This item doesn't say Gerber anywhere on the packaging.Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the real thing, A Gerber multi purpose tool."
3,Not for kids,"I enjoyed this book and thought it was well written. I think it was too graphic for most of my children (13, 11, 9, 7). It seems to be written for too mixed an audience. The hero is an eleven year old boy and a teddy bear, but the story revolves around adults and an adult situation. Definitely for older kids."
3,Great Children Movie,This is a great movie for the whole family but especially kids and it is funny and teaches kids a good lesson
4,Cute movie!,Very cute alternative to all of the Disney Pixar films. I recommend for kids 3+; mine love it and ask for it all the time!
4,"Kids belly laugh, parents giggle, and everyone dances","I rented this movie expecting to hate it. It did have some over dramatic and slow parts but I was presently surprised to find this movie had really funny moments. The voice acting/animated cast of this movie and the reversal of the traditional good guy, bad guy role make the movie very worthwhile. My youngest, 3 and 6, were belly laughing and asking for the movie to play again and again. The music from Highway to Hell to ""BAD"" had everyone dancing around the room. If you are looking for a kid's movie that parents won't groan through this is a GREAT rental."
5,Great family Movie,"Could not resist ordering this movie, the price was to good to pass up!! This is not only a fun movie for the kids to watch with friends but also a great movie to watch with the grandparents!!"
4,Fun action movie for kids and big kids (aka Dad),Saw this at the theater with my son and rented it a couple years later. Enjoyed it both times. Worth renting for sure!
3,Just okay...,"This was just an okay movie. I've watched funnier ones. I didn't hate it, but it didn't really draw me in. Don't think I'd rent it again."
5,Favorite!!,"I am 31 years old and will watch this movie over and over. It gets funnier everytime. I absolutely love this movie!!! Oh, my 4 year old son loves it too! LOL"
5,Megamind (Single-Disc Edition),"My children kept borrowing this DVD from other family members, so it was time to get our own copy this year."
4,Pretty good movie,"I like this movie. It is humorous and fun. The kids like it too. Not sure it is a favorite, but one of the better kids flicks we've bought in awhile. Worth watching - more than once!"
5,More Rapture Please!,"The first time that I saw this video I was 21 years old. That was in 1989. I seriously cried. This video of Anita Baker was the most truest of all her videos. Not only did I enjoy hearing her live--but truth be told--this girl can really sing! I must have watched it over and over again until I just couldn't watch it-- and then some. Well, I lost the video after I relocated to New York in 1990. But ten years later, I found it again on Amazon.com. And still, everytime that I see it--I still cry. ""Watch Your Step"" is one of her most powerful performances. I still feel like I'm in church everytime that I hear this song. Anita just goes somewhere... faraway... in this song to a place that only she knows. It's great! I love her so much!"
3,Subtitles???,"The DVD's are very interesting.But it is a pity that no subtitles are available.I would like to use these documentaries in my music lessons in Belgium, but without subtitles (even if they are in English) this will be impossible."
3,Very good theoretical explanation of FEA,"This book provides a very good explanation of the math behind finite element analysis, but no information on using FEA in a real-world setting."
3,"Good concept, but unbalanced.","Been an avid smashball player for many years, and have gone thru too many of the cheaper (tho fun an functional) $10-$13 ones. Thought of making my own sturdier paddles, so when I saw these, thought I'd give it a try. These are firm, with minimal flex, so if you're a ""banger"" like me, serious stroke adjustments need to made in order to maintain longer rallies. This was expected. But what really concerned me, was the obvious imbalance: top heavy, and the flimsy feel of the narrow, lighter handles: the latter (as the days playing progressed), being the more noticeable flaw in the design. You would think that for something in this price range (not cheap, since you logistically need two), that this issue would've been resolved. For these specific paddles, the handles will need to be built up in order to achieve correct balance and feel. I will definitely make my own paddles the next time, knowing now what needs to be incorporated into the design process."
4,good enough,"The body of the racket is a bit narrow at the bottom (near the handle), makes it a little hard to play at first, but I guess it is just a matter of time.The handle is very convenient and soft.And the racket is very light so you don't get tired soon!"
5,Low-impact thorough workout,"This workout does not look as tough as it is! Leslie really works all of your muscle groups in a low-impact, easy-to-follow routine all in 30 minutes! It was exactly what I was looking for in a 30-minute workout!"
2,Wish I had read other feedback before I purchased this.,"A stated in some of these other reviews, you will not get anything from this book that you could not easily access online. I was hoping for some information like a quick reference to icons on WebEx, how to set up and save polls, etc. Nothing like this there. You could write this book after spending about 2 hours reviewing online materials."
1,Not very useful,"I bought this book thinking it would show/describe common techniques for art related projects (some do's and dont's). Or even a bit on brazing (for welding with exotic meatals like copper and brass). Instead, it is just a step by step for several really uninspired projects. And then mostly tack welding. Not much serious welding.It does cover some very basic information on the different welding processes, but you can get that online for free. I would suggest saving up for weekend welding classes at your local community college. At least you will learn proper welding techniques from pros. You can then determine what equipment is best for you for your needs."
4,Not a First Hand Review,"I purchased this as a gift sent directly to the recipient so I did not actually get to see the product first hand. However, the recipient raved about the quality and usefulness of the product. Personally I wouldn't buy one for myself simply because I think it's a bit corny to wear a BBQ tool belt. However, if you are a corny person, as is the person I purchased this for, then go for it. Probably good for tailgating where you would be surrounded by even greater examples of over the top behavior."
3,review of First Truth,"This book took too long to get to anything interesting and I was bored with it. I would have stopped reading halfway through except that I was halfway through and so I finished it.There are two characters introduced to the reader at the begining of the book. Strell and Alissa. They find their way together to a mythical place called The Hold. Alissa is the daughter of a Keeper, and is searching for a book called the First Truth. Strell is the son of a prominant pottery family who has made his living as a piper.I would recomend this book to teen and preteens"
2,First Truth: Fell flat,"When I first started reading the book, I thought I was going to enjoy it. However, as the story progressed, I realized I didn't like the main characters, Allissa and Strell, because they were very flat and static characters. And the villain was just awful. when the reader is first introduced to Bailic, you think he is going to be a very smart villain; however, he ends up being very stupid and unobservant; he reminds me of the stereotypical villain you would find in a melodrama. Characters are extremely important to a story, and because there were so few, the author should have spent much more time developing her characters.The plot was so-so, and the climax fell flat. I believe it was only in the last chapter that Allissa found ""her book,"" the item she was so set on finding since the beginning, and nothing really exciting happened.I know this is the first book in a series, but I do not plan on continuing reading it. One of the few fantasy stories I have read and did not like."
2,Cliche Fantasy with Clunky Pacing and Low Creative Level,"Kim Harrison and Dawn Cook may be the same person, but the writing is worlds apart. I tracked this novel down after being totally wowed by the nine books in this author's urban fantasy series, which starts withDead Witch Walking (The Hollows, Book 1). ""First Truth"" is a cliche fantasy coming of age story with temperamental and immature characters, tons of useless scenes, a random pet kestrel named 'Talon' (yeah, expect this creative level), and an extremely slow plot with little resolution. I do not recommend this novel if you expect Cook/Harrison to be as good in her early works... you will be disappointed."
5,Biography of a Psychic,"The title catches your eye, but Mia Dolan's lifelong struggles against poverty, abusive men, and family losses makes an interesting memoir even if the psychic parts were omitted. It details her efforts to survive verbal and physical abuse and to make a life for herself and her children and to overcome the circumstances and poor choices that try to drag her down.Adding another dimension to this, is the awakening of her ""gift"" which enables her to help others. For those skeptical of anything they cannot see for themselves, this may seem too airy-fairy. For those with open minds, it's fascinating to see the development of Mia's psychic skills.This book was published in Britain under the title, The Gift."
5,Cest Bon,"This is a really great collection of cover songs sung in French. I bought it because it had Barry McGuire's ""Eve of Destruction"" used at the end of a Michael Moore documentary. I was pleasantly surprised that I love the entire CD."
3,NOT SO PUNK COMPILATION...,"TRUTH BE TOLD....If you put this OFFSPRING greatest hits on a party, i will REALLY REALLY enjoy all these great PUNK and some PUNK POP songs...but this compilation from OFFSPRING really brings the REAL POP moments from this old punk band....And i gotta notice....NO SONGS from their masterpiece IGNITION???? NO SONGS from their good raw debut??? man, it's hard to say, but OFFSPRING really sell their sound...I always will enjoy ALL I WANT, THE KIDS AREN'T ALRIGHT or GONE AWAY, but the OFFSPRING glorious days were REALLY REALLY in the past of old punk albuns like SMASH and IGNITION..."
2,"Maybye its they're greatest hits, but what do the masses know...","For pre-americana fans this will be mostly painfull to listen to, bordering on OK with a very few half-decent songs from a little earlier on in the line-up. No doubt the post-Ixnay fans will lap it up though..."
2,Obviously They Didn't Get the Real Offspring Tunes,"Dong't get me wrong this is an okay collection but their music needs more exposure and not only the radio singles. I have about 6 of their albums and its all great fun. They should make a GOLD Collection just like Sublime. They didn't just put the radio songs but other great out of the mainstream songs. Where is Bad Habit, I Choose, Don't Pick It Up, What Happened To You?,Americana, Pay the Man, She's Got Issues, Race Against Myself, Long Way Home, Million Miles Away, Come Out Swinging, One Fine Day, Dammit I Changed Again, Staring at the Sun, Living In Chaos, Smash It Up, The Noose, Lightning Rod. Plus The Other Songs and that would be a good offspring compilation but the record companies don't care about the fans just the money."
3,"Hey, I don't own it, but the tracklisting...","...isn't too impressive. Sure, it has all their popular songs... but seriously, Americana was a pretty disappointing album on the whole (especially the singles). The tracks on this album are acceptable for an introduction to the Offspring (Can't Repeat is a great new track, too, and should replace Green Day's Good Riddance as the classic graduation song...), but really, I'd recommend picking up Smash and Ixnay to hear the entire albums, which are hardly featured in this collection. They're the best ones out there. So yeah... I'll rate this three stars, not because it's disappointing, but simply to deter customers from buying it and instead getting the goods! Sure, though, yeah... a nice intro for the ""highlights"" of the Offspring's musical journey."
2,Missing the Offspring Huzzah.,"This could be so much better... The best songs on here are ""Gone Away"" and ""Original Prankster""... and those are rather pop to my taste...Why not the SMASH sound? This album needs the in-your-face bull that Dexter so gladly whips out."
2,I love it!!!/I wrote too soon!!!,"I have been wearing this toe ring for a few weeks now without taking it off. I have had several toe rings and I have learned to choose them wide and thick so that I can keep them on all summer. Like the prior reviewer mentioned, when you take them on an off a lot, they wear and eventually break at the bend point. I can not wear thin toe rings because they slide and turn too much and dig into my toe, so a wide ring is best for me. I highly recommend this ring! I have worn it through many showers and it's holding up nicely!Edit - June 29, 2011I wrote too soon! Last Friday, I was walking and this toe ring split in two and fell off. I hadn't been taking it off, so I wasn't causing a bend impression in the ring. At most, I would tighten or loosen a bit, if needed. It lasted me @ two months. ;-("
1,Don't waste your money!,Plays with a LARGE watermark in the lower left hand corner the entire time...... VIDEO YESTERYEAR. Nice job! I had to return it and get a refund....
5,New lessons from old,"It may be an old B&W movie, but there are life lessons here. I used this story to show my autistic grandson how we can overcome adversity. He thought it inspiring, marveling at the drive and determination of Douglas Bader."
3,"works as advertised, but beware","the thing works great--plugged it into the single ethernet drop at my desk (runs to a switch in the server closet) and devices connected through it don't even realize what's going on and the throughput is excellent.however, powering it from my windows vista machine caused it to bluescreen repeatedly. worked as expected from my linux laptop sans the crashing."
2,Aluminum Heater Core / Not Brass,"This is Not the Original Design Brass Heater Core, as pictured. It is made of Aluminum, and the core is similar to a cross flow radiator, tubes with fins, and the end bells are different. It will Fit, but it's not original design. Mine had 2 damaged tubes, small dents. I returned it. Bill"
5,The Original Renaissance City,"This is a grandly illustrated and beautifully written history of the small Italian city of Urbino, which at one point during the Renaissance rivaled Florence and Roman both economically and culturally. It was the birthplace of Raphael, and the town features many works by that artist as well as by Piero della Francesca and other artistic luminaries. It remains a real jewel of a town. This book is highly recommended to anyone planning to tour the Italian hill towns of Umbria and Tuscany, to follow the Piero della Francesca trail, or enjoy a hiking trip through the Umbrian countryside. It also offers a great armchair journey to anyone interested in Italy."
1,To thin for large tile,"I bought this while doing a large floor and counter job using large porcelain tile with many precision cuts required. I gave up on this blade because of the flex on thin trim cuts. It does a pretty good job on wider straight cuts but will drive you nuts if you need to trim off 1/4"" or less. I switched back to a blade with a thicker kerf."
5,Love it!,"We bought this for our son's nursery, it has withstood 4 years of our children turning it on and off, the night light feature is great! It looks much better than the lamp we had for our daughters that just had a bare light bulb behind a cut-out for a night light."
2,IT WAS A GIFT!,"Oh about this one - I've NO idea what or how this painted.The scaborous, scurrilous Mr Kinkade's treacly, overly ""twee"" and Bygone day stuff makes me sick up a little everytime I see them. But I didnt buy it for myself. i bought it for someone whom's taste is suspect but she's family and I'm stuck with the clueless cow. (I keed - I'm a kidder) The tonal values are like something akin to the color scheme of circa 1970s home furnishings - lots a pastels, - his stuff should come with an airsick bag. It looks like the art your grandma would hang in her guest room, the one with the quilt from the Carol Wright catalog where she got the wolf themed thermal blanket.I've read he doesnt even paint all of his own paintings.Leonardo wept.I'm adding ""poop"" as one of the tags for the product.m wright"
2,Far too basic....,Far too basic for even the average fan - i found myself skipping around too much when i started reading things that anyone who has any knowledge of baseball should know. This book may be a good beginner's book for younger fans.
5,Great Packaging and Speedy Service,Got this as a house warming presents and still get thank you's from the new home owners today.Would order another from this person again.
1,Great music ..,....the choreographer fails miserably - the fine dancers in thiswasteful production had to be mortified...in street clothes & sneakers - moving around in a banal parking lot - utterly useless appropriation of wonderful music. Junk in the name of daily modernity. Life is too short for ...this.
1,Hellish,"Want to have nightmares? Well, then get this DVD.What was the Lyon Ballet thinking of?????Copellia is a very gentle, charming wisp of a ballet. A light touch is essential. Delibes score is light and delicious.All of that goes into the trash can. Much of the music is cut,this version of the ""ballet"" is set in a seedy urban setting.There is almost no dancing. Swanhilda hardly exists except todo some quasi-ballet moves in combat boots while munching an apple.The horror really begins in act 2. Dr Copellius is able to produce a never ending series of Coppelias, they emerge froma movie projector. All have red dresses, spike heels, and blondwigs. They seem to be both male and female underneath the oppressive costuming. And that's pretty much where the ""concept runs out of steam. There is a little more perfunctory action,instead of Swanhilda doing some of the doll specialty dances,Dr Coppelius and Franz do them instead. Why?What did this gentle ballet do to deserve this?"
1,COPPELIA - so-called,"Please don't waste your good money and time on this video/DVD. It is NOT a ballet. Even though the music is the classic Delibes' ballet music, the performances and/or sets and/or watchability are below ZERO. There is no ""dancing"" per se. No pretty costumes etc. Just street clothes and shoes! and performed in what looks like a parking lot ---- I think you get the idea!"
1,Porcelandia,Skip it. Not that funny at all. The t.v. shows were a billion times better than this. I've seen bad shows or movies and usually I see the whole thing even if I don't like it. This is one of a few dvd's that I had to stop because it was awful.
4,cute!,"very small and very cute. worth the money, because it comes with a very reasonable price tag, even with shipping."
1,Huge Disappointment,"The first 190 pages deal with how to customize components and how to create your own components - basically information found in the Flash Help section.The last 1528 pages are a *replica* of the Flash Help - Components Language Reference section.1908 pages of the Flash Help section without word search capabilities!The only positive thing I can say is if these five authors are responsible for the Flash Help section, they did a great job. I just don't like paying for photo copies of something I already have."
1,Disappointing,"This book was put out by Macromedia itself. Based on the title, I expected an original book that would be well written and instructive, to complement the more dry technical online documention. I opened the book and found it largely an effort to make a quick buck, providing little that is not already freely available on-line. The first section of the book is not original as another reviewer has pointed out, however at least it organizes some help section material into a readable flow. The bulk of the book is just reprint filler. I feel I got ""taken"" on this purchase. As you may have seen, Macromedia was notorious for having complaints over its published books. Hopefully Adobe will operate this end of the business in a different fashion."
3,A tip for novice tile cutters,"This is not a review about the product, Just a tip for you guys who are saying that the blade walks.All saw blades will warp or walk when getting to the end or trying to shave edges on tiles.You can NOT be cut by a tile saw unless you hit the fingernail. If you touch the blade nothing happens, its not sharp. It actually grinds the tile not cuts it. So when cutting thin strips or getting to the end of a cut simply press the saw blade into the cut with your right guiding hand, I use my knuckle on the pointer or just use my finger tips. That will keep the blade from warping and your cuts straight. I worked with a tile union guy for a few years and he taught me alot of these little tricks."
3,"Decent, but one size does not fit all.","It got the job done and fit within my PT Cruiser dash very nicely, but frankly didn't fit around my new stereo as snugly as I'd imagined. There was just enough wiggle room left vertically that I found it necessary to glue in a thin strip of foam to prevent the stereo from shifting around. I realize this is supposed to be a somewhat universal dash kit for the car makes listed, and that the manufacturer has no idea what type of stereo you plan to install. With that in mind, maybe it would work perfectly well with a different model of stereo --who knows. Just be prepared to do a little improvisation if it's not quite right."
1,missing installation brackets and support plate,"This package contains no parts for actually stabilizing the new stereo. It only contains a face plate. If one actually wants an installation kit you will have to buy this product which does include all necessary pieces to install the stereo:Metra 99-6505 Chry/Dodge/Jeep 98-UP with Pocket Dash KitThe package of this product states it includes installation brackets, but it does not. It's as if the company is trying to sell something they mispackaged."
4,sounds awesome,more power and the car sounds awesome when you get on it. the gas mi didnt change tho. but oh well love the power and sound.
2,Its nice enough but it is not creole,"I got this book expecting my gumbo's, roux, piquante's, bisques and king cakes, but no it interprets creole as Caribbean food! Even the back blurb says 'authentic traditional and modern recipes from the sun drenched islands in the Caribbean'!There are a lot of recipes in here I would never associate with creole, such as callaloo, jerk seasoning, pepperpot, conch and lots of food with papaya and mango. Why this was not called caribbean cooking I will never know. In fact there is not one classic creole recipe in the whole book! however it does dedicate 14 pages to jerk and different jerk rubs which is great.Its a shame as creole books are hard to come by and this apple press series of 'cooking' books are surprisingly good with nice pictures and easy recipes. But this one did dissapoint. 2 stars purely for some nice tasting recipes."
2,It's Definitely Thin.,"I am glad I got this on a Friday sale, otherwise I'd feel totally ripped off. It is indeed cashmere, and it fits pretty well (although it does tend to stretch out unflatteringly after wearing it awhile). But mostly, it's thin. Very thin. I wore it once and noticed a hole midway up the right sleeve that wasn't there when I put it on. Of all the apparel I've bought on Amazon, this one feels the most like a rip-off.And ditto on not buying any more cashmere."
1,Cheap stamped metal,"The picture, description and pricing would seem to indicate a well made utensil, but actually turns out to be a cheaply made thin stamped metal fork that twists and bends easily. Very disappointed customer."
2,"Math isn't for infants, but this book is","I removed this from its envelope and gasped when I realized it was only the cover - the entire mass of bound pages had fallen out. Used books rock. After I remedied this with Elmer's Glue, I set out on a mathematical journey. Except it wasn't very mathematical, this thing is really colorful and childish. I believe Prentice Hall has a penchant for publishing the most ridiculous, simplified drivel. Most of the pages are taken up by these erroneous rambling storybook things that go way out on a tangent. Yes, they're ""Excursions"" but they don't have to be so mindless. Maybe I'm just taking the wrong math class. I'll try College Algebra with a different book next year."
3,Mathematics,"The item came in a fair about of time. The condition was ok, for the price paid. It was fair."
2,Not much eye candy here,"The amazon women in this film wear unflattering outfits. They wear big hats that cover the entire head (no hair visible) except the face. From the back, you don't know whether they are men or women. Sure, you can say this is realistic, but this is a phantasy anyway, why not make it as enjoyable as possible?There are also way too many scenes of one woman battling another in the arena to the death.The film is about how Thor and his friends organize an uprising against an evil queen. It is not a battle of the sexes. Men and women fight against other men and women.A much better movie of this kind is ""Kilma, Queen of the Amazons"". Here, the amazons wear skimpy, sexy outfits of fur and leather (no hats) and ride bareback on horses at full gallop, swinging spears and swords. Plus they are gorgeous, 18 to 25 years old."
1,Overpriced for 1 blade,"The picture shows a box of 5, but I only received 1 blade. Local retail price is about $10 each, so having to wait 3 weeks and only getting 1 was very discouraging."
5,The Positronic Man,"A heartwarming tale and a sad history. An amazingly accurate satire of our civilization and our own inhumanity. Touching to say the least. If you have never read a book by Asimov, this is the one that will hook you. If you have, this book will reaffirm your commitment to the master of Science Fiction"
5,Required Reading,"After seeing the movie ""Bicentennial Man"", I ran straight to the library to pick up ""The Positronic Man."" (I was surprised to find the book 'out of print', especially with the recent release of the movie.) This is the first Sci-Fi book I have ever read, and first review I have offered. I have not been in high school in some time, but this book should be required reading! I'm sure it would bring some hefty discussions on the issues of humanity, morality and mortality. A very thought-provoking, fascinating book and a joy to read."
2,Man this thing is ugly and freaky looking too,"I bought this for my baby's room because we have it decorated in a Bumblebee decor. The animal looks scary, freaky and ugly. The legs and wings sort of flop around and have very little support. The eyes are a shiny green and overall I would not buy this again. I bought it only because of the price."
5,I LOVED this book!!!,"Steve Sullivan gives you credit for having a brain. He delivers a conceptual understanding of a process and lets the reader fill in the blanks. His message is crisp, straight-froward and doesn't mince words. As a result, I got just what I wanted. The book cemented in my mind what a sales relationship should be about-Gaining Influence with a customer. The anecdotal stories made the book as entertaining as it was educational. I will use his Objection Handling Model for the rest of my life."
2,Not as shown,"The harness I received was different from the picture. The harness was much thinner and less substantial than in the photo and had fewer ""buckles"" to adjust to your rabbit. Plus, it just came crumpled in a bag (no cardboard rabbit cutout), and there was a plastic tag with nothing attached as if the tag had been cut. There was short printout of the text that was written online stuffed in the bag as well. Disappointing. Perhaps a different supplier would have provided the proper product."
1,Not worth your time to read it,"I used to love Cheryl Holt, but now . . . not so much. This book is indicative of the Holt that I don't like at all - unlikeable characters, idiotic plot points, and then the most unforgiveable of crimes - no romance. Yes, there was sex. But between the two main characters - the first time they do it was around page 200 and it was not that good a scene. There's lots of voyeurism, and disloyalty. The hero is simultaneously an idiot and a royal jerk to the heroine, for months and months. The heroine is simultaneously boring and quite stupid, taking the hero back into her bed after. . . um. . . she looks at him, despite his very hurtful and longstanding betrayals. But then he apologized so profusely - oh wait, no he doesn't. At all. I can't even say this book was formulaic - because the formulas for romance novels are good. This book . . . isn't even good enough to be called formulaic. It's just. . .boring and not worth your time to read it."
2,no supero mis expectativas!!!,"la verdad es que cuando lo compre crei que era lo que necesitaba, pero despues de dos meses de uso el bulto se rompio increiblemente en el ziper. estoy muy incomodo con esta compra no lo recomiendo su compra y uso y eso que soy un seguidor de la marca fiel."
4,finally found that 1.5 din kit,"I looked everywhere for a 1.5 din dash kit to install my radio and .5 din equalizer, but no one seemed to carry them. Finally I ran across this one, which did the job beautifully. The plastic is a little flimsy and there were some corners sticking out that didn't fit easily at first, but that's pretty par for the course with these things. It looks good now that it's installed."
5,This has become my new favourite!!,"This is an earthy, healthy and a filling lentil soup. I eat with Ajika aromatic rice. The spice combination is excellnt. Yummmy!!"
5,Awesome Book,"An absolutely wonderful book. Godement's style is extremely succinct and clear. He explains difficult concepts of modern algebra with extreme fluidity. The organization of the book is also wonderful, especially in his description of modules over rings."
5,Fantastic Backpack!!!,"Love this backpack!!! Super comfort along with so many useful compartments. Looks great also. You can tell its not one of those entry level backpacks.If you are looking for a backpack that is comfortable and stylish, this is it!!!"
4,"Almost perfect,","The zippers are not smooth... Hopefully, it'll get better after break in.Other than that I really like this backpack. I like the many pockets, stylish color and a lot of room inside. I bought this for traveling. I read the reviews and I thought this backpack would be only good for books... But it wasn't! This has a plenty of room to store stuff and also doesn't look too bulky."
5,Awesome bag. No cons,"This bag is definitely the best bag i have ever had.I ordered it two weeks ago, and got it last week.It holds alot of stuff, and the pockets are big.The zippers mover smoothly.It has two main pockets to hold the larger items, and then two smaller pockets to hold the smaller things like pens, pencils, ipods,etc.All in all- I am going to keep this bag for as long as I can. It's everything I want in a bag, and I can carry it everywhere.Great product!:)"
5,Worth the price and then some,My kids can go through a backpack in half a school year. So far this one has held up better than most and looks like it might make it through the entire school year. It would be a HUGE bonus if we can use it again next year.
2,High Sierra Swerve Pack (Black),I always place the product name in the title because Amazon does combine reviews at times. I had to return the book bag within 30 days because part of the zipper because exposed from the inside. It seemed like a good product at first. I am disappointed the product did not last very long.
2,Not exactly what I expected,"The colors were not what I expected and it was smaller than expected, also. I also had a hard time getting what I wanted because they were out of quite a bit of products I chose."
5,Awsome Backpack,This backpack has it all ! Wow. Compartments for everything. Great price for the product. Material and workmanship are excellent for the price.
5,Nice backpack,"This backpack is a nice quality. Solid construction. I ordered the Garden/White/Ash color for my teenage daughter and she loves the design. The background is a really eye pleasing white color and the design has flowers, birds and trees."
4,Great backpack for students,"I gave my daughter this backpack as a gift. It is very well made and its colourfull design is very distinctive, stylish."
3,small backpack,very small compared to picture and description. pricey for the quality. Would not recommend this back pack to othersMuch better backpacks out there for less money
4,"Zippers, Zippers, and more Zippers","I think my title kind of explains how I feel about this bag. There are so many different zippers on this bag that it seems a bit excessive. With that being said, I still like this bag very much. There is 1 main compartment (can get to it through 2 different zippers), a small pouch in the main that can be opened through another zipper on top, and 3 secondary compartments each smaller then the previous but all are still quite large. I love the fact that it has so many compartments, but it also may have too many. Sometimes I almost feel lost finding stuff in my bag.In short though, if your looking for a bag that has a lot of compartment and can hold a out of stuff, this bag is a solid choice. It looks good and even though it can fit a lot, is not so big that it looks awkward. I made it only 4 stars only because of the excess of zippers and possible overdoing of the number of compartments."
1,Encourages divorce,"It's truly bizarre that the author calls this book ""Taking Responsibility"".Many of the book's examples of taking responsibility for your own happiness in the context of a relationship involve LEAVING the relationship. Unless your partner is abusive, is addicted or is breaking the law, this is NOT taking responsibility! Taking responsibility means assessing your own positive and negative contributions to the relationship and, especially if it's a marriage with children, RECOMMITTING to that marriage.Branden has been married and divorced several times and had at least one well known affair. Please consider the source when deciding whether this book is really going to teach you to ""take responsibility"" or just encourage you to run from responsibility, when truly taking responsibility is uncomfortable.Don't jump on the ""I'm in pain so it's ok for me to make you suffer"" bandwagon."
5,Photo Scanner,"The product has exceeded my expectations. I had shopped locally for purchase, however, I found the Amazon.com price to be far better than a local purchase. I should have saved the gas money and started my shopping on line. In addition I did not have to pay shipping or taxes. I'll be back........."
1,I wouldn't buy,I bought this HP scanner and it was nothing but trouble. I have been reading online about install issues with this scanner and it may not be worth your money and wasted time. I often troubleshoot friend's computers and I have built more than 10 computers over the years and I have never had to spend over 5 hours trying to get a piece of hardware to run. I never did get this scanner to install and I am glad to be taking it back.
4,Concrete Saw,"Received saw on day promised. Packaging was damaged but the saw was OK. After reading instruction and doing minor assembly including putting in oil and gas I try starting the Robin's engine. It took several pulls to get the engines started. Being ""NEW"" I expected initial start up to be more difficult. Once the unit started and warmed up I could stop and restart the engine with one pull. However, when I used the saw for the first time several days later the engine did not want to start. After pulling for 25 times or more, it started. Something tells me that he choke is not working properly. Next time out I will call customer service if I have the same starting problems. I have to say that the saw operated and did a great job once it started. Easy to use and the cuts looked great in the 24ft. X 36ft. garage."
4,"for fans only, but very interesting","DHG is of biographical interest to us hardcore PKD fans, and I doubt it would mean much to those who are not familiar with his life. This book covers an interesting and gloomy period (circa. 1970) of PKD's life, and deals with people and events that are given little attention in that seminal biography, Sutin's Divine Invasions. As the above reviewer has noted, the material forms what would later be A Scanner Darkly. The book itself (esp. the cover art) is very tasteful, and the book is quite rare, so it is one for collectors. PKD one said that his poetry was terrible, and the poem in this book is living proof of that:-)The two major essays in this book, ""The Android and the Machine"" and ""Man, Android, and Machine"" are also in the more complete ""Shifting Realities of PKD"" so I would recommend that book over this one for those reasons, but for those of us who have to have them all..."
1,Not Worth the Money!!!,"I had much higher expectations for this book...perhaps too high. Normally the Dummies line is rather well thought out and explains most application attributes fairly well. I found this book to be dull, lifeless, and the author focusing more on humor than useful information to keep his reader from putting down this book. One major gripe is in the area on the ""mail merge"" function as it relates to ""envelopes and labels."" The explanation of this function becomes too hairy even for experienced computer users, and needs to be revised extensively. If you have no other recourse, this book will, at least, get you started. However, if you need something with a little more bite...I'd recommend the Visual QuickStart Guide."
5,Mentalist Fanatic......,This was a brand new sealed copy of one of my favorites t.v. shows...another gift from my husband. I love this show and can't wait until season 5 is available for purchase.
2,"I like the show, but this dvd set is badly produced.","Do not pay full price for Mentalist Season 3.The first two seasons of this show's dvds are perfectly satisfactory. Season 3, however, is the most poorly produced dvd I have ever seen. Horrible pixellation/rastering in the image, like a second-generation VHS copy. It looks better on regular broadcast television. The menu screen looks totally normal, but the episodes themselves are blurry, twitchy, and unwatchable.I suspect that these are not dual-layer discs, but single-layer. To save a bit on production, they compressed the digital info to fit on the cheap discs.Marvelling at this botched, sub-bootleg production, I realized that the industry is douchily declaring their intention to abandon the DVD in favor of Blu-ray.My copy, luckily, was also defective, in that two discs of the five were unplayable, so I got a refund."
1,A Clever Smarmie Cult of Cersonality,"I watched some of the Mentalist. It is clever, and is based on the perceptions of its main character of which there is a sparse smattering of clues to as how he does this. Clever writing. Being something of a deep perceptionist myself I see the holes of the story and it is bothersome. But again isn't all television a cult of personality? Just not my cup of tea I guess because of exploitations of perception inherent in the show's premise.Tighter writing exists in other shows such as Fringe and The Closer (with some good sub plots.)"
1,Don't bother with this one,"As a lover of all things horror, slasher, etc. I was looking forward to receiving this. Unfortunately this movie does not provide anythng of value. No scares, no creep you out stuff, no extreme violence, no erie plot, no gross out effects. I could go on. Giant holes in the plot and many unexplained sequences. The film makers attempt to add a tripping erie set of sequences which will only get to someone under 14 years old or someone who is actually tripping at the time of viewing. Try Eric Stanze's Ice From The Sun for a low budget acid nightmare feel. This movie fails on so many levels I wonder how it even made it to DVD. After 30 minutes (which seemed like 2 days) I was checking the clock. Save your hard earned cash!"
2,Not that shocking or haunting...,"Reading all the hype regarding this low budget horror film, I expected a film 10 times more creepy than the Britain made Woman in Black DVD. (Which was creepy, shocking and wonderful) Instead I watched a horror film that had some really great moments (faceless nuns wondering around...demon clowns teasing and taunting), but some really ""ho-hum"" moments too. (The toy plane scene was ridiculous as were several scenes that went nowhere.) The acting is mostly atrocious. The good points did not overcome the bad ones so this one gets a big fat ""C""."
1,Dreadfully Dull,"The biggest mystery is how many people (based on reviews here) seemingly enjoyed this poorly-directed, amateurish film. Trust me - rent this one before you even think about buying it. Better yet, forget about it completely. It's not frightening and it's definitely not comparable to Suspiria just because there's a few (pointless) scenes with red gel on smoke."
1,WOW,"I was very interested in seeing this movie because of all the reviews stating it was ""the scariest movie ever"". So i trusted the reviews and bought it. Boy was i surprised that this movie that had so many great reviews is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. First of all theres no way to get passed the amazingly horrible acting. I have never seen such terrible acting ever and probobly never will. Second of all it's not even scary, it's too cheasy to be scary. I mean i know he had a small budget but i mean come on this makes troma look good. Trust me everyone this movie is total trash. Don't waste your time or money"
4,Good police page turner./,"I rented the audiobook read by George Guidal. I found the story to be fast paced, credible, entertaining and the writer did a good job of crating enough suspects within the story that he keeps you guessing until the last couple of chapters. One small criticism is that some of the scenes are written as if they are a movie script rather than a book, almost as if he is using the book to sell the movie script. In any case, good, light high caliber entertainment."
3,"Great start, cliched finish","I bought this book after hearing Mr. Hosp on a local radio show. I work at a competing law firm in Boston and thought the book would be interesting since it is set in the Boston legal community. The first 350 pages of the book were very good; full of character development, a good storyline, interesting plot twists. Then as Mr. Hosp set about wrapping up the storyline, the book went completely off the rails. The final showdown was so clichéd, from the action to the horrendous ""do it for Johnny!"" type dialogue. Just an awful, awful ending to what started out as a very good book. If Mr. Hosp writes another book, I'll certainly give it a go and hope for a better ending."
2,"sad kittens, sad kid","My one-year-old loves, loves, loves the other books in this series, so I figured she'd love this one, too. But, she can't stand this one. I don't know if it's the crying kitties or the scolding mommy, but she will not allow anyone to read it to her. Oh well..."
1,False advertisment,"We have several items of Waterford Crystal we purchased in Ireland two years ago , now my wife wanted a Lismore 10"" bowl witch I went on Amazon and the description said MADE IN IRELAND , the bowl I received is stamped made in Slovenia . This is bait and switch ... I will return this item and never again buy from AMAZON. DENNIS HOLLORAN"
3,Seems to work but some design flaws,"I recently got the Tranquileyes after suffering for ages with dry eye. I used it a couple of times and seemed to feel some relief. However the strap keeps coming loose and sometimes right off in the middle of the night, losing the seal it is supposed to have to maintain the moisture level. The foam pads glued to the goggles themselves (rather than the removable ones that you wet) are also already coming unglued and I have only had the goggles for 1 month and used them maybe a dozen times. While they do provide some comfort the design really needs to be improved for the price."
5,My favorite sandals,I loved these sandals and wore them almost every day for two spring/summers. So sad when they finally died. I bought another brand last summer and was very disappointed.
4,Thought provoking,"I enjoyed this book and felt I learned something about a culture and country I did not know enough about. I decided I wanted to read her previous book, ""The Good Women of China""."
3,Excellent workout!,This was probably one of the best videos I've seen in a while. It's not too difficult and it's not easy either. It's perfect for a morning workout or a supplemental workout if you can't get all of your cardio and fat burning in at once!
1,no,So long and boring. I did not used it. too technical not enough visuals in the book to keep me interested
4,Captivation,"Can't remember why I bought this, whether it was impulse, intrigue or research, but when I pushed the play button I was bracing for something like 1349, or some strange Norwegian Black Metal venture. Boy, was I wrong. WRONG. The first song, some eight minutes and change, I thought was an off-put shot at setting the listener up for a metallic blow to the senses, but no. It drones on and on quite beautifully. The next impression I had was ""whoa, that drummer's got an amazing feel for time."" The second impression was ""now I know where David Lynch draws inspiration."" Moody, very very moody. A.D.D. stay away, music fans gather. Given a chance, you might be able to seduce that super hot vampire chick sitting across the room on the red vinyl love seat with this CD. Enjoy."
5,Get ready to laugh,Dana Carvey's disc is a laugh a minute. I enjoyed Dana back when hewas on Saturday Night Live and his early years. When I saw this on tvI knew I would have to find it and buy it. If you like Dana Carvey you willwant to add this one to your collection.
4,Region code 2?,"Really, TNT, really?This film is great saturday afternoon fare, and deserves a region 1 dvd release. Come on, put it in a three pack with the Young Guns series and call it the Emilio Estevez western matinee pack!Filmed for television, as I recall, don't know that it would benefit from a blu-ray transfer."
4,Canon PIXMA iP90 Photo Inkjet Printer,"I needed a printer for document and letter production while traveling with my laptop computer. I have not tried the photo option yet. The printer is compact, produces clear and clean printing, is easy to use and easy to transport. I had an initial problem installing the ink cartridge and called the company for help. The company responded promptly and the problem was quickly resolved."
4,so far so good!,"ordered it from amazon... came nicely packed... easy to install on my laptop...the only concern is that the ink cartridges are the smallest thing i have ever seen. i have only printed out 1 thing so far, but it was crisp and clean and the color was exactly right. the whole reason i purchased it was for an upcoming trip to florida. I need to work while being there on pleasure and needed something that would travel well. i am a little concerned about the weight. i expected it to be a bit lighter."
2,I Like it,"Image is sharp and color is good. I like this model because in addition to 4x6 photos, I can print 8x11 documents. The printer fits in my laptop bag and goes with me whenever I travel. It's only been a couple of weeks, but so far so good. I give the PIXMA iP90 an excellent review."
1,beware canon excahnge policy,"I ordered this printer from Adorama through Amazon. The printer did not work and was pronounced defective by Canon tech support. Canon advertises a 30-day exchange policy, but when I asked for an exchange (24 hours after the printer arrived), I was told variously by different customer service reps (including a manager): 1) that Canon has a ""new-for-new"" exchange policy but I would only be getting a re-manufactured printer because the company stopped making it in 2005: 2) that the policy is ""re-manufactured for new"" only; and 3) yes, the company still had new printers available, but the returns dept could not pull new printers from the sales division.I ended up returning the printer to Adorama, which did refund my purchase (but I had to pay for the return)."
5,Great lightweight printer,This is a great Lightweight printer. It is much lighter and thinner than its new replacement by cannon the pixma ip100.
4,pixma,Handy for our laptops. Prints well. Have it on a separate part of house which it makes it easy to use.
1,Buyer beware!!!!,"I took a chance on this and wish i hadn't. the sound quality is OK, but not great. the really bad thing is for some reason the intro to ""Love & Happiness"" is cut short. not a cd issue but apparently a tape edit or something from the source they used. This alone caused me to put the cd back in the case and haven't touched it since. Too bad since the packaging and liner notes are really great. I have emailed the record company that released it weeks ago, have heard nothing. So i'd think twice about getting this, despite the recent reissues sounding even worse."
4,Mixed feelings about this set,"I bought this CD after hearing some of the instrumental stuff on my Pandora station. The first CD has those great instrumentals that really drew me in, with amazing atmosphere and beats. The second CD I could go without. I am just not a huge fan of the vocals laid on the track."
1,wrong region,"unfortunately the blu-ray was unable to be played in Australia, I would have thought Amazon would have been aware that they were posting to Australia and either informed me or not sent it."
2,pg-13,"Would like to see you sell this item, ""The King's Speech"" in the PG-13 version that was shown temporarily in theatres. I am aware of many people who would be interested in a PG-13 version.I had to put a rating even though I have not seen the movie. I do not want to see the movie with the current language in it. I realize some people disagree, and that is fine, but would be nice to have available in both versions for people of differing feelings and opinions."
5,The King's Speech,"Despite my personal distaste for The Anglican Church and It's History founded in Anti-Catholic Bigotry, I was touched by this Film and The King and his impediment and how he overcame it.I thought being that it was British Funded (just as PBS is slanted and Boring most of the time)I was wrong this time,I found the movie at times besides sad and ""Heartfelt"",funny as well. Although I don't think Winston Churchill was so,and Neville was mentioned briefly(the Appeaser)."
5,very enjoyable,"""The King's Speech"" depicts the intense struggle of England's Prince Albert to overcome not only his severe stammer, but also to embrace the role he never wanted or was trained for, that of King of England. With the steadfast, loving support of his wife, ""Bertie"" learns to trust the unconventional Lionel Logue as a speech therapist. It is the growing friendship between the prince and Logue that forms the foundation of this film, and is what gives it its heart. All of the actors are exceptional. It was a refreshing change to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a more ""normal"" character for a change, and her understated performance shines through. The awards this film received are all well-deserved."
5,AMAMZING!!!!,"One of the most amazing peices of art that I have seen in many years, the performances are stellar, the writing incredible, costumes, impecable! Truly worth the accolades that it received."
5,The King's Speech,This was an excellent DVD movie. It was too short though..... I could have watched more and more of it. It was interesting.
2,Nothing that great,"Maybe I was hoping for too much since this movie won best picture but really did not find it that great. Think with a few adjustments here or there it had the potential to be much better in my opinion. Got a little bored in the middle of it. There have been a few past winners of best picture film that I did not find very interesting. Obviously, many people disagreed with me. If you like history type dramas then give it a try for yourself if you have not seen it.Peter J. Miller"
5,Three Generations Gripped By This Fine Movie -- Repeatedly,"Our extended family has played this three times and is still getting pleasure from this ""True Story"". The writing, acting, and production is of the highest quality every moment. The Blue Ray makes our top-of-the-line HDTV come alive. This disc will never be traded in. This is a very-unique theatrical production: It sucks you in -- because the deep characters are so easily understood."
1,Great movie; don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray,"""The King's Speech"" is a great movie, but the Blu-Ray disc is unplayable on many popular BD brand players, such as Samsung (my experience) and LG (read the other reviews). Apparently the copy protection on the disc is so strong it fools the players into thinking they don't have enough memory to play it. My experience was that the player took nearly ten minutes to grind haltingly through the first ninety seconds of the movie. To add insult to injury, a group of inane movie previews you are basically forced to watch before getting to the main menu play fine. The DVD is nearly as good quality and plays fine in any DVD or BD player. Don't waste the extra money on the unplayable Blu-Ray disc!"
5,A TRUE CLASSIC!,THIS IS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS AS WELL AS ADULTS! YEAH THERE IS SOME CURSING IN IT BUT THATS WHAT WILL GET THE KIDS ATTENTION. IT IS A BEAUTIFULLY TOLD TRUE STORY AND EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT. COLIN FIRTH DID EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN THIS ROLE AND HE WAS LOOKING AS HANDSOME AS ALWAYS :)
1,kings speech,"sad to say this was not a good movie some of the actors are good but the plot????? you would never call the prince of Wales Bertie especially from a person off the streethis family would have used that phrase,and the person that was suppose to be Churchill left a lot to be said, may be this was because the people that made the movie never bothered to check this out,or check news reels, when the Prince of Wales's brother abdicated the throne and his brother the prince of Wales became King, shortly after that was the beginning of WW11 all in all not a very good movie just another version of how it was viewed from an modern American directers point of view or how they thought it should have been, just wish they would do there home work and get it right instead of chopping it up like they did,"
4,Awesome,I dunno about ya'll but this book was awesome I really enjoyed this book like all his books I've read they are all really good I haven't found one I haven't liked so far but this one was really good I really liked they way the girl liked him and he didn't know about it it was really good but there was some sad parts in it
4,Misty,I have searched everywhere for this movie! My fourth graders read it as a chapter book.We had fun comparing the book to the movie.It is dated but still takes the class to Va.
3,boring,i love animal m ovies. i love horses. but this was dissapointing. I wish i didnt buy it at all
1,Most of it was really boring!!!,"In the past, I enjoyed reading the book ""Collected Short Stories of Saki."" So, I decided to get the complete works. Well, it sucked!I would advise that anybody that wants to read Saki for pleasure should stick the Collected Short Stories. I sold the complete works to a used bookstore within a week of receiving it from Amazon."
4,"Good-looking, Works well","This is an attractive grinder. Salt shaker on top is handy, as is one-handed action! My only complaint is that there's not a much difference between the coarse & fine grinds."
4,A very innocent time,"Bell was one of many ""arabists"" who traveled throughout the Middle East near the end of the Ottoman empire. This book is really an interesting travelogue and insight into Middle Eastern culture from the view of a privileged English woman who was viewed as curiosity by those she visited and traveled with. In a way, this is a fairly innocent view of that part of the world, but you could do worse than read this book. Much of the clannish nature of the cultures she wrote about is unchanged from her era (and indeed, from centuries before) and is worth the couple of hours it will take to read this book."
2,Decent Small Group Primer,"Dreisbach offers a decent model for small groups that creative church leadership could adapt. I think his handling of ""traditional"" church wasn't as well thought out as it could have been. I selected the book knowing I was reading something profoundly different from some of the other church leadership books I had been reading. I would have much rather he just outlined this as a ""House Church"" model and marketed the book as such. Sure we can make the claim that the early churches in the New Testament were house churches but that was because Christianity was so new. The church building was a product of the need for a house of worship that evolved from the house church.My advice to church leaders considering the book? Take the basics that are presented here and give thoughtful study to the paradigms that are presented. I felt those were helpful. The rest is just rehashed material. You'd be better off buying a book like ""Can We Do That?"" by Andy Stanley and Ed Young"
4,Great Documentary,"This is one of the first WWII documentaries that really show the mistake that Hitler made by invading Stalins Russia. I'm not good with words but no one else had written a review for it. Sorry. But if you like War documentaries watch this, it's great."
1,A great disappointment,"Besides the film being poorly mastered (the image shakes so muchthat gives us the impression that the DVD was mastered inside a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean ), it was made during wartime by the US Government. The DVD then tells the story from the ""official point of view"" and, of course, ignores all the new evidences that were discovered/unclassified since then.If you want a comprehensive look on what actually happened on Russia and WWII as a whole, you must then order titles such as ""The World at War"" narrated by SIR Lawrence Olivier. If you expect this documentary to be as good as National Geographic's comprehensive approach on the Battle of Midway (6 stars-""The battle FOR Midway"" ), forget it."
1,bad condition,"First of all, the seller charged $26 for the book, and on the back cover the price was 7.95. I got a refund from Amazon for the difference.secondly, when I received the book, the cover was completely OFF! So I glued it to the book. Now, the whole book is falling apart!"
2,Too big to be useful,"This drill is very large. My big hands can't even make it all the way around it to squeeze the trigger comfortably. Very unsteady.Not typical of DeWalt, mine arrived with a chuck that spun around in an elliptical fashion, instead of circular. It would not drill a single hole. But that is rare. My review of 2 stars is based on the disappointing size. For what you need this drill for (getting into tight spaces), maybe a Makita would be better. Size is the most important factor with a drill such as this. I sent it back."
3,Cordless Right angle drill,My company uses many cordless drills and we recently found a need to get into tight spaces. Now my crew wants more than one.Michael P.
2,Heavy Duty I think NOT,"The DEWALT right angle drill works well but you need to take good care not to drop it. My DEWALT 18V cordless right angle drill broke when I knocked it off my tool box. It was a 14"" fall and I guess it just landed the wrong way. When I picked it up, it started rattling. I was thinking ""NO WAY"". I couldn't believe it. It was a 14"" fall. I also have a Bosch 18V hammer drill which my neighbor accidently dropped on a hard concrete floor from the top of an 8 foot ladder. A few scratches but it still worked flawlessly."
3,Great fan till it started rattling,"Ordered two of these over this past summer (2012). They really do help. Used clear plastic to enclose our large screen room. Ran new 10"" flex duct. Added one of these, but soon needed the second to cool. Now its cooler outside, so only run the furthest one which by chance is the quietest. You get more air flow leaving the vent cover off. For the price, will more than likely replace with the same and hope next one doesn't rattle so much after a couple months use. There has to be a better way to build a mouse trap than these cheap""o's"". LOL"
2,a flat cliche of lesbian lives,"Rather than breaking cliches, this movie seems to embrace them: the principle characters appear to be incorrigable partner swappers and there is even a scene where a U-haul joke is told. The dialogue is terrible; the relationships between the characters seem superficial and shallow. The film improves a bit toward the very end, when new love interests develop, but you may not make it that far without first hitting the 'eject' button on your VCR."
2,Not good for making pens,These are decent tools for small ornaments but not big enough for turning pens. The roughing gauge is tiny and it will take you forever to get a Slimline pen down to the right size.
1,Too good to be true!!!,"After my order was cancelled, I didn't complain immediately since I thought there was some mistake sometimes. Then I still found the item advertised and decided to give it another try before writing a review. This time they didn't wait 1-2 weeks but cancelled it immediately after 24 hours. The funny think is that they still have their product listed here. Amazon should ban them from selling anything here and remove this misleading advertisements."
5,Experiencing God,"Simply awesome. Praise be to our Lord Jesus Christ for the gift given to the authors to write such a helpful tool. Our Church is using this workbook to know our God in a deeper, personal way."
5,The Best Way to Know and Do the Will of God,"I used this book a year ago with a group of four other men in my church. At the onset, we thought that the best way to start our group was to find God's will for our lives. By the end of the 13 week study, 2 of us were in different states serving the Lord, and another one stepped up as a ministry leader.Blackaby is a great author. His organization and step-by-step guides make it very easy to follow along.I am so excited that I am ordering 2 more books as my wife and I are going to begin reading it again!"
1,Tiny cradles,"The cradles are absolutely terrible, holding only the tiniest of bicycle frames. We had five bikes in our household, and the rack cradles would not fit a single bike. We tried two mountain bikes, a 5-year-old's bike, and a 7-year-old's bike. If you buy this to hold four bikes, be ready to buy four crossbars to make them actually work with this rack."
2,Limited Use,"Thomas represents itself fairly in this book. It gives you what you might expect given the painstaking chore of citing locations of over 1300 monuments & markers: ""very general locations"", in short, it will get you in the vicinity of a marker, but I would gather you could travel two miles on a road trying to find a marker location described as "" West Conferderate Avenue"" (I'm not kidding here). A very general road map with the names of main roads is provided on the back cover, but you get no other graphics what so ever, like a grid identification system (i.e. A-3, B-8, etc.), to get you closer than just the name of the road. This guide is good for determining/confirming IF there is a marker on the field for a specific regiment (say a distant relative, great-great grandfather) and where you can wander around to find it, but beyond this it will not save you alot of time or aggravation. Look closely at the Thomas description, it doesn't promise you alot, and you don't get a whole lot."
2,"Less of a boxing movie, more of a re-hab family drama flic","Not a treat for the boxing fan, it's just too dramatic and focuses on the family drama surrounding a crack addict. There's barely any action, suspense, romance, or comedy in it (or boxing for that matter). The best part of the film is the original HBO footage of the older brother fighting. The preview is a huge spoiler too, I can't recommend this film, it's mildly entertaining with a good cast, but the parts of the story they choose to focus on were quite unappealing for a boxing fan like me. The choreographed fight scenes are pretty unrealistic as well, all in all left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Definitely worth checking out,I will spare everybody my lame esoteric views and just say - if you were interested in this movie at all in the first place - you will definitely not be disappointed. It is really good.
4,"Familiar Formula, But Gets An ""A"" For Effort","After watching ""The Fighter,"" I realized that I have now seen more boxing movies than actual boxing matches in my life."
3,The fighter,It's a movie that could have a bit more action and a better story line however it keeps you watching
3,Disappointing!,"This was made from a real story. All the acting was acceptable, but Mark Wallberg is beginning to be the same character in each of his movies. There was a lot of The Shooter personality in this movie. Don't like fighting so my feelings are tainted by that. The movie was just too predictable and was not very entertaining. Definitely for a select audience. This movie was definitely superior to that ""The Other Guy"" - a real waste!"
5,Closer to a 4.5 But Worth Watching,"This film is worth watching for the acting by Christian Bale alone, but I truly want to commend the screenwriter and crew for doing such a phenomenal job in creating an all encompassing world for these actors to thrive in. The story itself, nothing new, still manages to weave an intricate and complicated plotline as the two lives of these boxers plays out and presents a perfect setting for Bale and company to shine. Definitely something worth checking out."
3,The Fighter,"So - so story line. Don't know how this got nominated for best picture. Definitely enjoyed the performance by Christian Bale, but after that.... found myself wandering away from the movie at times."
3,"not as good as i thought , or as good as people said it would be.",It's and ok movie.not worth the theater money but maybe a redbox.bale is a great actor.but the storyline was a bot weak for all the hype.
4,Excellent look at a new england mill town,"I really enjoyed this movie on a couple of different levels. It is a good story and a true story. So good entertainment in terms of a movie. But I very much enjoyed the look and feel of the movie from a New Englander who grew up in a very similar city in massachusetts. The hair styles, clothing, attitudes, buildings and streets were all extraordinarily well done. They really did their homework on this movie and got a real feel for what life was really like."
3,The Fighter,well to be frank with you can't see it as an Oscar winner and would never compete with any Stallone film. not sure if it rates an OK. Probably not what anyone wants to hear.
3,I love these actors but...,"I've been a fan of Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale for years. But seriously, I watched 45 minutes of the movie and wondered why I should empathize with these characters. I know it is supposed to be a dramatic movie, but I've seen episodes of soap operas that work better than this. The actors are amazing so I can't help but think there was something wrong with the direction of the film. Where's the passion? The first four Rocky movies as well as Cinderella Man brought it."
3,Predictable,"This movie had a great cast with strong acting, however the story line was slow and highly predictable. It was an average movie with an unoriginal story."
4,"Amazing, the best MP3 out there",The I-pod is amazing. I am still figuring out I-Tunes though. It would have been nice to have an instruction manual or a tutioural when you first download the program. I immediately put it in a case to protect it (it can scratch very easily). I haven't put any pics on yet but am interested to see how that works. All in all I'm glad I got it and I'll be suprised if I ever use all the memory!I don't rate it a 5 because of the software and the FM transmitter doesn't work as well as it should so I can't use it everywhere I bought it for.
5,wow!,"This a great product (yet again) from Apple. If you own a Mac (like I do) this works real smooth. I was able to sync my contacts and calendar too apart from all my music and podcasts without ANY hassles.The colored screen has a more than decent resolutions and it syncs with iPhoto to make literally ALL your snaps available for viewing anytime. With 15 hours of battery life for music this is perfect.It uses the same cable to charge and sync. It can also charge using your computers USB port. Not many people talk about this but I really liked the sound quality that my iPod delivered using the headphones that came with it. One downside I feel is when the noise level increases in my surroundings I have to take my iPod out, unlock it and then change the volume. No easy control on the headphone for it!!!"
5,Ipod,"excellent product, only had it for a couple of days tough (Ipod Video released and had to get one :p )"
3,Defective,"I rated it all 3 stars based on how easy it was to work with the seller on refunding the money since the item was DoA. I would still come back and buy from this seller. This was a much older iPod and hard drives really only last so long, I've gone through three on two computers."
1,Did not recieve what I ordered,I did not receive what I ordered. In the product description I was to receive a used Apple ipod 20gb Photo. I did not receive this product at all. instead I got a 4th generation white ipod that does not work at all. I am very disappointed and will not be ordering anything further from Amazon marketplace ever again.
3,Love the concept if it will work for me,"I just purchased the iPOD Color and the Bose Sound dock...what a great combo! I love the clarity of the music. Only problem is that my iPOD Color just froze on me, in the middle of a song screen. I tried all the tricks on the Apple support site to reboot it, nothing worked. I worked on it for an hour or more. I am going to return it to the store for an exchange. I will also follow a person's advice here and purchase the extended warranty. Are the iPODs known to be problematic?"
2,Not a Great Movie!!,"I don't normally write any negative reviews,but this one was a stinker.I bought this DVD because my son just did a book report on Sounder. I also read a couple of nice reviews and read about the awards this movie was nominated for. i thought that this movie was pointless and boring from the beginning to the end. I don't know how it ever got nominated for anything. The acting was ok but the screenplay was just horrible. I would not recommend buying thisDVD unless it's under 5 bucks. Sorry."
1,Poor in every description!,"Item did not fit into the housing, mounting bracket too wide. Lower tube 1"" too short! Leaks! Poor quality re-pro item. We all know what I have to go through to take this back out of a 1969 Road Runner. Someone should pay me for the several hours of my labor to replace this."
3,Customer Action,"Dr. Johnson presents an insightful primer of consumer behavior, and how the manager can best serve the customer. By using the information contained within the book, one can better understand the myriad of factors that drive consumer behavior, and the market's reaction to them."
3,My Thoughts,"The book was okay. It didn't exactly deserve to be called a Super Chiller. I've read better R.L. Stine books. I really like them in fact, but this one sort of stunk. Come on Stine you can do better. I want to read the next Seniors In too Deep. I hope that it's a lot better. The ending in Let's Party was a little week!"
2,I WAS DISSAPOINTED!,"Geez! It's a new series, and I was waiting forever for it to come out, and when it finally does, and I read it, I felt dumb that I bought such a bad book! I love Fear Street books, and I've read almost every one, and this one, by far, was the worst! It was more of a Goosebump book.It was like the seniors were 10 year olds! Please R.L. Stine, make the next one better!"
4,I really like it!,"It looks great, the price was even better. It was a little tricky to install even for my very mechanically inclined husband. But it's up now and works well. No complaints. The light bulbs are a little pricey, but that really has nothing to do with the quality of the light."
1,A Piece of Junk- Don't Buy,I bought one of these and after eight days the electronic controls refuse to work. It does what it wants. I can't even turn it off and on. But the worst part is Fridgidaire will not honor the warranty. I been been trying to get them to have it repaired for over a month and all I get are lies and given the run around. I spent money on phone calls being put on hold because to talk to a rep I have to dial a number that is not toll free. The treatment I've received from Frididaire/Electrolux is disgraceful. They will tell you anything to get you off the phone and then they ignore your requests. I can't say what I really think of these jerks. They deserve to go bankrupt.
5,Great deal,"I use a variety of KMC chains on different bikes and this one is like the others. It is cheaper than the Shimano or SRAM equivalents, shifts better on my bike with Shimano components, and comes with a reusable quick link. It lasts about the same length of time as the brand names."
4,A great place to go when you need some help,"I was fortunate to find this book at a local library at a time when I was seeking help for my badly damaged hair. If you want to get some pretty useful advice about getting the curly mane into order,I'd say you could do very well right here as a start. I have eventually gone on to start locs now myself,but if you choose not to go that route,this book will still be a blessing and encouragement. I just think it's a shame that we actually have need for books like this.It's our hair and yet we find ourselves at a loss as to what to do with it as it really comes out of our scalps because we've been masking it with chemicals for no really good reason for way too long."
3,Educatioinal Experience,"I was somewhat disappointed with this purchase. Many of the pieces played were at different speed that I had come to learn them. Some pieces were so fast, I thought that it was unreal, others were slower than I anticipated. I realized that music is open to personal interpretation, but I feel that about half of the pieces were off tempo. Admittedly, I am not a Bach expert, or an Elliot Gould fan, I feel that this purchase was almost not worth the time and effort I spent looking for it."
5,Excellent AND Funny!,"What a great movie. We watch this every year. Charming, funny, sad, great reminder to slow down and smell the roses, etc. I LOVE Ally Walker, perfect for this role!"
2,Annoying,"This is the most annoying acting Hayden Panettiere has ever done. I loved all the other movies she was in and thought this would be cute and fun to watch, boy was I wrong! She was loud and abnoxious. That mixed with Ally Walkers sour and boring personality along with bad acting, made this movie horrible! My family watching it with me - half of them left the room and the rest of us were disappointed! We were all annoyed!"
4,Chocolate extract,"This is a good product, but I didn't taste the chocolate. I use it with plain yogurt and Equal. Still, it has a flavor that's tasty."
2,Impossible to read,I am trying to read this book but it is not making any sense to me. I will never get through it.
5,A Dog of Flanders,"I actually love this movie,to me it is truely a classic which moved my heart and soul. If you ever loved a cat or dog when you were a small child this movie is for you. I only wish they made more movies like this one now. I recommend this movie to any parent who wants to show their kids what goodness is. I say five stars and hooray!!!!"
4,Great Ideas,"The Open Hand Cookbook is one of the cookbooks that inspires me. It has very cohesive and inventive menus, and is fun to read and cook with!"
4,A Rare Gathering of Texas Legends Giving Their Best!,"I live in Austin and recently saw a preview of this concert video. First, it's a great way to spend your money for a good cause . Second, it truly demonstrates why Austin is considered by many music lovers to be the best city to see live shows. The DVD looks and sounds great! They did a nice job recreating the live feel of the performances. One of the most exciting points about this concert is Spoon! You understand pretty quickly why there's so much buzz surrounding these guys. All the artist are at the top of their game. Natalie Mains sounds great lending her vocals to Patty Griffin and Joe Ely. Escovedo prowls the stage like a panther, and Willie Nelson (as long as he's been performing) still executes his familiar tunes as if for the very first time. For anyone who is wondering what all the fuss is about when it comes to the Austin music scene, this DVD will set the record strait. And then ya'll can come down and see us all in person!"
2,A Great Series! I Guess.......................,I watch the suite life everyday.I think its a great show.I think i won't but this dvd.I mean 4 episodes is a waste.I can just ask my brother to record it with his dvd recorder.I'll buy it when its has all the episodes of the first season!
4,Too many syllables,"This book contains thoughtful essays that critique Frank Jackson's story about Mary. The selections offered what seemed to my unprofessional viewpoint to be wide-ranging and comprehensive. I thought Frank Jackson's own commentaries were among the most readable and penetrating. Excepting Jackson and maybe one or two others, the various authors, all professional philosophers, seem helpless when offered opportunities to use big words when small ones would serve. Did they want to be understood, or admired at a distance by lesser beings? If I were grading the essays, writers in the habit of using words greater than 6 syllables would be encouraged to revise their sentences. Or hanged."
2,Numerical Lineal Algebra not much on applications,"This text may be OK for math theory types, but for engineers wanting to know applications and how to use matrix algebra it was extremely lacking. There are very few examples, only proofs. Hardly any probelms with actual numbers are solved. I only bought this book for a course I was taking and I ended up hardly using the book at all because it was just too difficult to interpret. Not recommended for those looking for applications."
2,Mommy's Busy Book,"Do I really need extra paperwork to do to plan my child's day/week/month? Some good ideas, well stated and some ideas that don't have enough detail to be helpful. A lot of this is more for preschool age or very late toddler stage(at least if you have a boy). A lot of very talky filler. As a busy Mom I don't want filler to go through, I just want easy to find ideas with complete and clear instructions for materials and methods. Much of what is good I have seen elsewhere. This came very highly recommended, but the friend who recommended it doesn't go online."
3,Not so creative,We found a lot of the activities to be common sense games that we have already tried. It is a great book for those that need a push in the creativity department.
2,Nothing special and quite repetitive,"It's better served as a 'check out at the library' book rather than purchase - Flip through it once and you've got everything you need out of it, I would not consider this a reference of any kind. There were multitudes of entries that were repeats with small changes...at least 5 different crayons to make just with different mold types, games with the tiniest variations and things like 'sing nursery rhymes'. So many of the entries would not keep my toddler entertained for long, maybe my 8 month old but by no means any older. Out of the 365 entries I found only about 25 to be new or creative ideas however my 2 year old has not had any held interest with the 7 I have tried so far. I am constantly looking for new activities for my children and this book would have to rate as one of the lowest quality activty books I have read. I would not recommend this book."
4,I like it so much!!!,It's so Util..Me encanto!!! te hace jugar con tu bebe con lo que menos puedas imaginar...te da tips perfectos para juegos...por ejemplo a mi bebe le encanta tomar todo lo de mi cocina....ella te dice como hacerle un box de utensilios de cocina paqra que el lo disfrute y sea seguro para el jugar...me encanto muchisimo! te ensena que no hay limites!!! puedes hassta pintar en tus cristales con tu bebe y todo estara perfecto!!!tienes que tenerlo!
3,It's an OK book,"This book is a bit outdated but it offers some great suggestions for playtime. However, I am not sure if it's worth the money."
2,Does NOT include a permanent filter.,"The technical specs for this product included a permanent filter with this product, and I was disappointed to find that one was not included with the product. I chose this coffee maker over another (slightly cheaper) model b/c I thought it included the permanent filter. Can this be fixed on the website b/c this is misleading?"
4,Second one,After replacing the first one which went dead after using it for one hour the replacement has been working fine. now it has been 3 months and it is still working. I have to agree with other people the first coffee u make with this machine it tastes like plastic flush the machine out couple of times you should be fine after that.
3,Minor Complaint,"I bought this to replace my existing DRX5, which is a very good small coffee maker. The only complaint I have about the new one is that they changed the display from a bright green LED to LCD and it is much dimmer . It's very hard to read unless you lean down and look closely. Adding a backlight would make it much better."
5,Love it!,I just LOVE this little coffee maker! It says 4 cup... but holds 2 1/2 c water... so for me .. that is not quite 3 cups. Still ... is a really nice little coffee maker! Programmable... easy set up... and programming. I also ordered a permanent filter so no need for paper filters. Have made 8 pots of coffee so far and is perfect! Doesnt take up much counter space... looks nice.... is very quiet... an all around good coffee maker for the money! Would definately buy again.
4,"pretty good, but yes, really small","I've had this coffeemaker for a year & it is very effective. Only downside is that it's hard to find the (baby) coffee filters for it! And it really does only make about a grande's worth of black coffee. Also, be careful of placing anything directly in front of it because the front buttons press very easily, and sometimes it turns on accidentally. But hey, for the price, worth it."
4,Just right size for me,Im not a big coffee drinker so this is just the right size.. Shipping was fast and carefully packaged
2,Cute but WEAK,The coffee pot is small and makes 2 cups of coffee. Bigger problem is that the coffee flows through so quickly that it doesn't have time to brew in the basket. The amount of coffee I have to use exceeds what I needed for a large pot!Frustrating and little savings. Boo.
3,broke after a year,"well, they must've read the previous comments about the clock running slow because my clock runs consistently fast! I loved being able to program the coffee so it was brewed when I got up...but after a year of heavy use it has developed problems heating the water & brewing the coffee...it takes about 15 minutes to heat the water to boiling, then it gurgles & sputters & steams for the next 15 minutes while it tries to brew - I put in the amount of water for 4+ cups & am lucky to have it brew almost 3 cups. It was great while it lasted but I'm looking for a different brand to try...I don't think this coffee maker was made to handle the heavy daily use that I gave it."
1,Un reliable coffee maker,"This coffee system worked only a few days and made only some 10 cups of coffee, then ceased working for some unknown reason."
2,The coffee wasn't hot,I chose the low rating because the coffee was not hot when brewed and it didn't stay hot.I did like the design.
4,"Very Good Coffee Maker, Amazon Drops The Ball","I have two of these coffee makers, one in my office and the other at my shore house. They do a great job of brewing a small pot of coffee for 2-3 cups. The only challenge is having access to the 4 cup filters as they're not always easy to find. My one disappointment is the picture shows green l.e.d clock digits when in fact they're black. This makes it a little more difficult to read given the background is a darker gray. Amazon could do a better job of showing an actual coffee maker that ships instead of a corporate photo this is anything but 100% accurate."
1,Shocking...,"Worked well for about a week. After that, Armageddon. This coffee maker sent bolts of lightening out in all directions at anyone in the room. After many painful attempts to unplug it, we've decided just to build a new kitchen. We are beginning to think that the coffee maker is actually sentient. If you poke your head into the kitchen, it sends a small electrical bolt out as if daring you to come into the room."
3,get the Mr. Coffee NLX5 model instead!,"My mom has a Mr. Coffee NLX5 4-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, which we all love!I made the mistake of buying this model instead. The flip up top causes water and condensation to accumulate inside the top. And, trying to re-insert the carafe back cannot be accomplished, unless you flip the top up -- which you cannot do if it still making coffee."
