1,Does not work,"I tried it because I thought it would relieve my wife from using earplugs. After a few weeks of using this product, my wife still uses earplugs and there is absolutely no difference. It does not work at all!!! What a waste of money."
1,Consult your doctor,"This product did work for me; from the very first night of use, my snoring was significantly reduced in volume - to a tolerable level. HOWEVER, one concern a consumer should have is that the ""medicine"" in this product may cause a ""rebound"" effect; i.e., if you stop using it, the symptoms may reappear even worse than before.Bottom line: Consult with your doctor.I stopped using the product after a week and went on a doctor prescribed medication that, from a safety (FDA tested) point of view, I'm much more comfortable with; and the price is comparable given my health insurance coverage."
4,Cute Movie,My 2 year old recently was introduced to Pooh Bear and she loved this movie. Roo is the main character so she was little confused about just where Pooh Bear was most of the time but it was an enjoyable story.
1,"Pooh Characters Mean? Disney, please stop!","Hitting and being mean in the 100 acre woods? Isn't seeing that on TV enough? And its the ""adult"" characters being mean and the ""child"" characters are going to correct the ""adults""? Disney your not helping!!! The age group of Pooh needs to see mean or unkind acts immediately corrected. My 4 year old was bored, except a few scenes of the little Heffalump playing with piglet. The movie's point was over his head. Once again, Disney puts adult themes into a child's movie and once again they fail to connect with the child."
2,Bleech! Don't bother...,"I was eager to read this after loving the Ya-Ya Sisters and Cold Sassy Tree. We read it for my book club, and no one could get into it. The characters were incredibly flat, and the story contrived. The twist at the end was such an artificial plot device, it seemed more of an afterthought than a closure. I was truly amazed to see people liked this book in the other reviews. I hated it, and our book discussion was about 10 minutes long."
3,Slow paced book..themes related to friendship and quilting,I read this book after reading and enjoying The Diary of Mattie Spenser by the same author. This was a slow paced book and the plot was hard to follow at first. I found the character development weak and it was hard to keep all of the characters straight through to the end of the book. I enjoyed the main character Queenie and the themes of friendship and quilting.
3,"A predictable, light mystery","This book was a quick and easy read. I would have liked more character development, but I suppose there were too many characters for that. The sense of place wasn't really there, it could have been Anytown, USA. I had to keep reminding myself that the action was taking place in Kansas. The plot and its outcome were predictable, even with the red herring thrown in. A pleasant diversion for a few hours, but nothing I'd reread or recommend to friends."
3,Dry as a Kansas dust bowl,"I believe this book is one of Sandra Dallas's earlier books. It is a story of several rural families in Kansas in the 1930's during a time of terrible drought. I loved two of her later works: Whiter than Snow, and Prayers for Sale. This book was a little disappointing as the story line was a little slow developing and it was a little hard to keep track of all the characters. The book did get pretty exciting in the end, but it took a long time to get there. It does give a clear picture of how people got by on very little in tough times and how important quilting was to women in terms of a productive activity and friendship."
4,Good mystery and quilting theme.,This story was full of interesting characters and scenes. The plot kept my interest from beginning to end. I love stories with quilting themes and a good mystery. Fun read.
2,Advanced Listening Comprehention,"When I got the mail,the package was broken. They put it it a paper envelop and that day was rainy so book was wet. I could have returned it but i don't have time for it.And there wasn't any listening DVD n it, I think it was supposed to be in the package"
5,What about Coco Street?,"I just love ""letter to a poet! Can you tell me more info about diva Coco Street?"
4,Good Film!,This was an intriguing movie. It was well acted. It was a great story. The only thing I didn't like was the resolution of the apocalyptic theme. Kind of cheesy. Watching Bacic throughout the film is quite a bonus. He's extraordinarily hot.
3,Sound Quality,"A nice CD. However, it seems to be a bootleg, with everything mastered from vinyl LPs. I just got the CD for ""Trouble""."
3,Picture Incorrect,I thought it comes with the wooden stand but disappointed when I realized that its not included. Used it 1 time so far to chop a melon and its no different than my German knives.
2,It's not that sharp. Period,"I was smitten, and spent $200 bucks on this knife. I got it, and did the obligatory tomato slice. And... it didn't cut it. I had to saw like the dickens and ended up with some hideous slices. For comparison, I have an Oneida Performance santoku. It's seriously a $15 knife. I also have a Gatco carbide knife sharpener, which cost me $13 at Cabela's. With a few quick swipes across that sharpener, my Oneida cheapo blade is MUCH sharper than the factory edge on the Shun. Sure, the blade doesn't stay sharp as long, but it literally takes me 20 seconds (that's not an exaggeration) to sharpen it, and it performs much better than the price-inflated Shun.Stay away from this knife. It looks cool, but if you have ever used a truly sharp knife, you'll know instantly that this thing is an impostor. Needless to say, I'm taking mine back."
1,Caveat emptor,"Caveat emptor... Latin for Buyer Beware. Save your money on this one. Although Ken Onion got everything right on his design of this knife, i.e. ease of holding, correct cutting angle, etc. Ken didn't make the steel. This blade became dull after only one use. I thought I was in a bad movie after cutting 3 pounds of Sirloin beef for Baeuf Bourguignon on a ""Butcher's Block"", I had to use a sawing motion to cut through the last few pieces.This is unequivocally the worst purchase of my life, and I am 60 years old. I have relegated this knife to my junk drawer, and went back to using my American made butcher's iron knives."
5,awesome,"Best knife I have ever used, and I have used many. To the person who wrote the ridiculous review cricizing a knife he never actually used would like to say use it before you critisize."
3,My Husband Liked It Better Than I Did!,"His reaction surprised me because he tends to be a bit leery of historical-romance based material. However, I really think he liked the pirate, the pirate ship, the coast of Cornwall, the war, the smuggling and that kind of thing. I liked the pirate too. He's the 36 year old son of French actor Alain Delon so it was hard to go wrong with him as a French pirate. However, the story itself really didn't work well for me, in part because the ending was changed from the book's ending. However, it was an evening's entertainment and no expense had been spared in bringing this authentically to the screen. My husband would probably give it 4 stars and he liked the woman too. So if you want to watch a historical romance on your video/dvd system that won't send your husband scurrying out of the room, this one is it."
4,Better Than Expected,"It's almost always said the book is better than the movie, but until Daphne Du Maurier's book, Frenchman's Creek, is rereleased, Du Maurier fans will have to settle for the movie version. This is a remake of an earlier movie and although there are no major stars featured in this movie, it was far better than expected and well worth watching. The main characters are well-rounded and even subtle subplots are woven into the main plot almost effortlessly. There is a twist at the end that was unexpected, which made the experience even richer."
3,Meh,"Let me start by saying that I didn't read the book, so my opinion is based solely on the movie. What drew me to it is Masterpiece Theater's reputation and my love of Cornwall. I didn't think the movie did either justice. It was just barely okay. I almost turned it off and my husband only stood it for about 30 minutes. The plot was unbelievable. It plays like a modern fantasy romance rather than a period piece. No self-respecting woman would behave the way that this woman does with the smoking, drinking in a public house, and running around half naked in front of people. The ""romance"" was not very romantic. There is no courtship or falling in love. It's just a kiss and then we are supposed to believe that they love each other. If that were me, all the killing would cool any sense of romance right away. The scenery doesn't capture the beauty or essence of Cornwall. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but I won't be watching it again."
1,Formulaic and Derivative.,"This hackneyed, terrifically unoriginal ""thriller"" will leave fans of the genre reaching for their Le Carre or Deighton for a dose of the real thing. Silva's idea of a character flaw is a mild smoking habit? Please. I havent seen a collection of characters like this since I put away my Hardy Boys books. All of the women are slender and attractive, all them men handome and cool under pressure - not to mention sensational lovers with the security of an inherited bank account. The descriptions of exotic locales are tired: London - rain and fog; Cairo - hot and dusty. Skip it."
3,Left Wing Ryan,"If you are growing tired of the ideological bent of Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan, meet Daniel Silva. This book is something you might have gotten to read if Tom Clancy had been a liberal.A mole assassin is left stranded in deep cover by the end of the Cold War. He goes into business for himself and is ultimately hired by the military-industrial complex to shoot down a passenger jet and blame it on the Palestinians. The real object of the exercise is to get America to deploy a missile defense system and re-elect a right wing President.A resourceful CIA analyst is thrown into the fray and disrupts the bad guys' plans after a lot of good people (including his own wife) have been killed, wounded or otherwise put in harm's way.If this sounds familiar, it should. It is a variation of the plot of Clancy's Patriot Games, brought out of Ireland and set on the post 9/11 international stage.Silva did much better with The English Assassin. This is basic fluff."
2,Strong start but fizzled out,"The start of the book was promising, indeed. After about 100 pages, though, the writing fizzles. While this is by no means a boring book, it lacks the expert research and background knowledge of a Clancy book. Silva simply gets many details about actual intelligence organizations wrong. He still manages to pull out a quite interesting read.One thing though: how many ""Harvard-trained"" lawyers and cigarette smokers can fit into one book??"
4,A Damn Good Novel,"Mark of the Assassin is a powerful suspense thriller that begins on page one and grips you all the way to the end. By comparison to other authors (Tom Clancy, John Grisham,) Daniel Silva has found a form that keeps the pages turning and the bed lamp burning. Overall, read this novel. It is worth the money!"
4,A great spy tale,"the characters in this book were well developed and likable. the procedural and poltical aspects were ture to life and much like wat i dealt with as an FBI agent on the counter terrorism section. in all, this was an entertaining and true to life read."
4,Good but not great,"A lot of stereotypes here - the educated, mature CIA agent, his beautiful lawyer wife, a goodlooking international killer, a Ronald Reagan type of US President.... But otherwise, a good read. Mr.Silva pales in comparison to maestros Frederick Forsyth & John Le Carre. But the book is still a good read, & builds up to a nice climax. Read it!"
5,Solid Thriller!!!,"Unfortunately I can't stay up late at night to finish this, but this is a fantastic read. I loved every minute of it and it held my interest throughout the entire book, which is hard to do. I thought the characters were interesting and well developed. Great story line as well. Another good one."
3,A Stepping Stone To Better Novels,"I hate to denigrate any work of Daniel Silva. However, this work is not on par with his other literary successes. Especially the Gabriel Allon series. However, the plot is quite good. An American flight is downed by a stinger missile and hell breaks out in the Middle East. The conspirators start to erase their tracks to the crime, and need the help of a soulless assassin. I remain glad I read it."
2,"Not a Spy Thriller, No Gabriel Allon","I enjoyed two other of Silva's books about the artist and spy Gabriel Allon (The Messenger and The Secret Servant), but this one was a disappointment. It is not a spy thriller so much as a political conspiracy tale -- and a heavy handed one at that. Silva doesn't do politics as well as he does espionage. Just in case you want a synopsis, Republicans are evil and controlling the world. Wow, never heard that one before. Also, the female characters in this book are really distasteful. The one we are intended to sympathize with -- a Washington DC corporate lawyer -- is a whiner. Oh honey, how dare you go off to prevent terrorist attacks when you promised to be here to support me? Sheesh. And the other females are worse -- cardboard bitches and temptresses. The Amazon description says this is a ""Gabriel Allon novel,"" but as far as I can tell, he's not in the book at all. (I'm not all the way through the book, but I would be suprised if he showed up at this point.)"
5,Darling charm bracelet,My granddaughter loves this bracelet - I sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day.
5,You will love this CD,"Jonz has a very nice, fresh, and unique sound. Although he does put you in the mind of a Maxwell, Eric Benet cross with a tinge of a Prince feel with some of the lyrics and acoustic guitar. Very nice songs- my favorites are ""Pro-Vide"" and ""The Truth."" Check him out at (...)"
2,Was not good!,"I found this book horribly written. I guess I may be spoiled by the best true crime writers, Ann Rule, Jack Olsen, and Jerry Bledsoe. They know how to tell a good story even with the most wicked, evil deeds. While Tommy's story is indeed horrific and disturbing, there was nothing to draw me in. I actually stopped reading it because it was so bad...which I never do! Pass on this...wait for another author to write Tommy's story."
2,Okay but not a book I'll reread,"I'm a big fan of true crime but I wasn't enthused about this book. I found myself skimming pages, a sure sign that the author wasn't holding my attention. The subject held promise for a good read but the story just kinda, sorta ""wandered."""
1,Encourages Unhealthy Eating Habits,"With a childhood obesity epidemic in the United States, the last thing we need is a book that teaches kids to clean up their plates. Though this series of books is generally fantastic, I am terribly disappointed with the eating habits this particular book seeks to instill. Many prominent table problems among toddlers and young children are ignored. Healthy eating and eating until one is full should also be covered, but the author is completely oblivious to modern medical opinions on nutrition and diet. I am dumping this book ASAP.If you are desperate to teach healthy eating habits, trying new foods, and nutrition choices to your young child, I suggest Eat Healthy, Feel Great by William Sears. As far as table manners go and behavior management go, I am still looking for that book.Please don't espouse outdated attitudes about eating to one more child!"
1,Takes a long time!,I've been asked to review the item but how can I?! It takes forever to actually start receiving the magazine! I ordered the subscribtion in June and it will only start arriving at the end of September!
3,An interesting read but not quite what I was looking for,"When I read the description of this book on the preview page I thought I was getting a collection of diaries, journals and/or personal accounts of being on the receiving end of Nazi persecution against homosexuals during World War II. In fact, it was more of a term paper spending more on the reasons why the persecution took place rather than narratives from the prisoners themselves.The book is interesting with its in depth analysis of the reasons leading up the the laws of Nazi persecution, but I was more interested in learning about the personal human struggle than anything else. I guess I was looking for something like ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" with a homosexual twist. If you're looking for an historical perspective to party politics during the Nazi regime, then this book is for you."
3,size,We have an 18'6' Monterey Montura and this cover barely fit. We found that the only way to get it on was to put the back on first. The cover seems to be made for a squarish windshield as it sags inside the euro style windshield. Luckily we already had a support system from our previous cover that kinda takes the sag out.
1,On a concrete surface? Stay away!,"If you're planning to this house on cement, please for the sake of your pets, get something else.I've had this for less than a year, and the regular movement and bumping of my dogs has worn four neat quarter-sized holes in the base of the house.Also, when water drips on the roof, if follows the curvature of the plastic and comes inside the house! It's not as snug as it appears.Doors or flaps do not fit neatly onto this thing, and because it's plastic, screws can have a hard time holding. Do yourself a favor and look at your other options."
1,Broken out of package.,"I purchased two of these and one never worked. The other works but it's the opposite of the other switches like it I have in my house. When you push the switch up to the first setting it is on 100%, then as you go up on the switch the light dims or the fan goes slower. To me it should be the opposite but maybe that's just because the others I have in my house are that way."
5,The best book available,"As an author in the process of writing a textbook on FreeHand for Delmar Publishing (due out in 10/99), I have to say that at the present time Olav's book is the only one given a positive review by any of my students."
3,DVD is the best way to own this classic film,"Given that the film is roughly 30 years old, and no special effort was made to clean it up, the quality of this DVD is surprisingly good. The picture is bright and crisp, with flecks and scratches occasionally present but never annoyingly so. The sound is clear, but certainly not stunningly good. The subtitles seem to be reasonably good, although I intend to get feedback on these from some Czech friends. And the film itself is just as good as I remembered it from when I saw it on TV 25 years ago."
4,Enchanting,"Three Wishes for Cinderella is a beautiful and enchanting version of the Cinderella story; a must see! The only negative part is that it is not really for children to enjoy because of the language. The movie comes with undertitles. But anyway, it is a beautiful movie!"
1,Do not buy Lorex product,"I purchase 3 different Lorex systems, all have problems,and no warranty services. Buy these Lorex systems at your own risk because company does not back up their products.Do not recommend !!!"
2,Lady Bug,"The book is cute but costly! I realize this was written in honor of her son, but it should have been much more reasonable in cost and shipping."
3,Well done overview,"My first reaction to this book was one of disappointment. I thought it was too general and too short. However, since I've read it, I keep finding myself referring to it and implementing ideas I found in it. Many of the things I already do and I found this book affirming. I like her phrase 'Start where you are'. After reading her overview, one can always look for more information to cope with specific problem areas, like clutter."
4,"Great drive, lousey software.","I purchased this to backup my notebook computer (my primary computer) after a harddrive failure. I didn't want an annoyingly loud drive because I wanted it to stay on for automatic backups. I was a little worried about heat since it has no built-in fan, but it seems to run very cool and best of all, it's very quiet. It's nice having firewire also since that frees up one more USB port. It also goes to sleep when not being used and wakes up automatically when addressed. I'm very pleased with the drive so far.The Bounceback software on the other hand should go right in the trash. I gave it four stars because of this. It caused Win XP Pro to continuously freeze up whenever I opened Explorer (my computer) or tried to plug in another USB device or memory card (like my camera or thumb drive). I had to quickly uninstall it.I have since found a free download call Cobian Backup which I am very satisfied with."
5,great product,I love my Mr Coffee coffeemaker. It make coffee really fast and barely makes a noise. It does not have a lot of buttons to set and the price was great. It really helps to be able to read product reviews to now that I am buying a great product.
2,Takes forever to brew coffee,"Wasn't a bad coffee pot when we first got it, but after just a few pots the brew time began to slow down noticably. Now it takes about 20 minutes to brew a complete pot, and we haven't used it that often. I see that some people have had great luck with this coffee pot, and others haven't. Like so many consumer products these days, it seems to be the luck of the draw as to whether you get a good one off the assembly line or a junky one. Apparently we got a junky one. If you buy this, just beware that you're rolling the dice on product quality."
2,Brewed 2 pots and it's going back!,"Bought this to repace a Mr Coffee NLX23 (I broke the discontinued decanter). It took 30 min to brew 12 cups. 2nd pot the Pause and Serve function did not function and I cleaned coffee up from the counter. Grinds were in both batches. Because the lid is 8"" long, had to pull it out from under counter to add water and ground coffee. This is not what I want and need in a coffee maker! I am very dissappointed in this product."
2,Coffeemaker,"The carafe is designed in such a way that when you pour it - especially if you've made a full pot or close to a full pot - coffee spills out all over the place. If you buy this product, always make sure you pour over the sink. I have no idea why it does this, but it has done it every time so it must have something to with the design of the rim and pouring spout."
1,i have the older model of this,I bought the older brother of this for $30. I'm not sure if they fixed these issues yet but when you make 12 cup's of coffee the handle would break off and hot coffee goes on your hand. Also the coffee was never hot enough
1,Think before buying this item,Do not buy this coffeemaker if you do not like carafes that cannot be poured without spilling around the pour spout and dribbling down the outside of the carafe onto the countertop. It is almost impossible to pour with out spilling no matter how careful one is on the method of pouring. We had no problem with the crafe on the like model that we replaced and are replacing the new carafe with the old one which we still have and does not dribble.
5,Really good!,"This is SO easy to use even though I don't make coffee everyday. When I do, it's really easy and wonderful."
2,Only worked for 8 months,This coffee pot work great for 8 months then it just quit working. I thought it should have lasted a lot longer. It was lightly used only 2 or 3 times a week.
4,Works well,"I've had a set of Shun knives for 3 years now and hadn't had them sharpened. You are supposed to have them sharpened once a year. Shun used to provide sharpening service for free if you mailed your knives too them, but they have discontinued this service. I found this out just as I was getting sick of my knives been dull. The electric sharpener worked well, it took two passes on my 9"" chef knife to get it perfectly sharp, it was 90% of the way there after one pass. The sharpener is very loud, but I guess that is to be expected. The unit is fairly compact, which is good since I don't plan on using it more often than once a year. Overall I would say it is a good investment especially since you can't get the knives sharpened for free anymore."
2,There must be something wrong with me,"Most people love this item, but I got absolutely nothing out of it. Then again, I can't have an orgasm. The only thing I got was a massive migraine that lasted over a week, and cost me several trips to the doctor's office and a week off from work. A word from the wise, don't put it on max cause that's what I used. Other than that I'm pretty sure it's a good product. I just think it's me, no man can satisfy me, not even a machine, so I'm not surprised."
2,it'd be great if it worked like it was supposed to,"for the first 30 seconds it was lovely, but i believe that either the motor isn't powerful enough to keep the shaft rotating smoothly or 3 AA batteries just don't provide enough juice for the motor to work more than 30 seconds. it was a nice idea, but i'm rather dissapointed. the jelly material is somewhat difficult to maintain also. i think if it were hooked up to a larger battery pack it'd be WONDERFUL... which i think i may have a macgyver friend with a knack for electronics attempt to do for me."
2,First Duel-Stimulator...there are MUCH better ones out there,"I worked in an adult store for over a year and aquired many toys, etc. The Rabbit Habbit was my first duel-stimulator...they looked like fun, and this seemed like a pretty basic one. I found that the clitoral vibration wasn't quite strong or direct enough and the beads stopped rotating during when muscles were tightened. Vibratex makes another duel stimulator called the Koi which is STRONGER and more direct and the beads do not stop rotating...I have others, by other companies and they work SO much better."
3,Good for the first 10 times...HA,"Well, I have bought two of these. The first one broke afer just 1 month - the metal wire neck that bends and rotates the shaft completely broke in half. The second one broke during my 5th use!!! It just stopped rotating...the wire itself isn't broken...so it must have been poorly made. The bunny ears still work on both, but it [...] because the orgasms are so much better when stimulated by the G-spot and clitoris...Don't get me wrong, I didn't abuse this toy! The first one I had, I probably used only 10 times...it's a grat toy - it makes you orgasm in the matter of minutes, and it feels amazing - but it's inevitable that it's going to break within a month. I think I am going to invest in a better quality one, because you won't get your money's worth out of this one!"
2,Great while it lasted...,"Worked well at first, but vibration function randomly stopped working after only a couple of months of light use. Vibrator is very disappointing without this feature. Quality of construction seemed poor out of the box. The base with controls seemed like it should be attached, but just flopped on and off. I chose to purchase this model over cheaper ones because I thought the quality would be better. Would not recommend this product to others because of the poor quality."
4,Hier Kuier Die Manne,This is typical South African Braai (BBQ) music. Nice to listen to and very good party music. Although you may not understand the lyrics the beat is great!!
2,Content poor and difficult to use,"CC3 has a huge amount of functionality. The trouble is, unlocking that functionality is a herculean task. It appears that the developers went out of their way to avoid intuitive interfaces. Nothing works they way you would expect. This may be a hangover from its AutoCAD roots, but it really needs to be addressed before this product could be described as user-friendly. My other gripe about CC3 is the relative lack of content, such as textures and icons. Don't get be wrong, it has quite a lot, but less than some free mapping products and a lot less than I was expecting. I get the impression they have an eye firmly fixed on selling add-ons. Overall, a fairly poor offering given the price tag. A pity, I wanted to like this tool."
4,AN ACQUIRED TASTE...,"These British mints are, as the advertisement states, ""curiously strong"". Those who like the taste of cinnamon will enjoy these mints with their powerful minty flavor that underlies the hot cinnamon taste. Of all the flavors in which these mints are available, cinnamon is the best, with wintergreen a close second."
2,Swivel head problem,One problem with this ratchet. The button that allows you to swivel the ratchet end popped out. The material appears to not be hardened and has an indentation of the ball bearing in it. Electrical tape now keeps the button in.
1,Garbage - start to finish,"If this book was titled, ""Miscellaneous Nonsensical Ramblings and Point Blank Stupid Statements That Any 4-Year-Old Would See Through,"" it would be the only honest thing in this book.It doesn't take a psychic to tell that Sylvia spent no more than a couple of hours scribbling down this blabber. The seamless mixing of fable (unicorns?), generic pseudo-Christian beliefs, and obviously off-the-top-of-her-head wishful thinking really show just how little thought went into the writing.Just like her $700 for a 30 minute over the telephone 'psychic reading', this book is a ripoff.I just feel bad for the trees that had to be cut down to make the paper it is printed on."
1,One star is far too many,"This book would be laughable if it were not aimed at filling children's heads with absurd nonsense - for this I would call it criminally abusive. Talk of unicorns and warm temperatures is the kind of off-the-cuff blabber that a 3 year old would make up. A dying pet is a serious issue for a family, not something to be addressed with a bunch of half-baked feel-good ramblings. Do not buy this book."
2,"Love Sylvia, but not this book...","I love Sylvia Browne and am thankful for the wisdom and insight she has brought to the public. The premise of this book is a good one, and it could have been a very helpful product. However, the format of this book just doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Was Surprised,"I thought the book was going to be more in depth than it is. However, having said that ~ it's a wonderful introduction into the other side for children. Once they realize what a wonderful place it is for their pets, it must be a wonderful place for people too!"
3,For Children,"I love Sylvia Browne and this book is for children. It's brief, simple and cute. Great gift for kids. I love knowing that we will be seeing our pets again. It helps heal the pain of losing them."
3,"Nice to know our beloved pets do go to the other side, too.","After reading this book, I felt better about losing our beloved Chow, Bear, after having her with us for 13 years. I wanted to know if she was still with us in this life and if we would see her in the next and it answered all of those questions. It did comfort me when I needed it most. I would recommend it if you have lost a beloved animal and are wondering where they go and what happens when they die. Could be longer though. Overpriced, as new, for content also. Buy it used. It is worth it then."
2,Not what I expected,This is a childrens book. I was expecting it to go into much more detail. But over all the book was great for kids and I agree that it would be a nice gift for someone who just had an animal pass or has a child that has lost a pet.
1,DID NOT BUY BOOK AFTER READING REVIEWS,"I AM ALSO A SYLVIA BROWN FAN, AND AN ANIMAL LOVER. AFTER READING THE REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK I DECIDED NOT TO BUY IT.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT BOOK AND AFTER LIFE READ KIM SHERIDANS BOOK ANIMALS IN THE AFTER LIFE, IT IS EXCELLENT."
4,good,"I have known the author and find that all of his writings have a great sense of being able to escape from the pettiness that so often affects religious writings. Muhammad never claimed he was a son of god and in Islamthere is no such thing as original sin, so why have to die on a cross? This is a good read for anyone REALLY wanting to obtain a better understanding of some of the current world events."
5,What a catch!,"Doc is just an ordinary guy, a retired dentist to be exact, who loves to fish. Lew is the local sheriff who needs Doc's dental knowledge to solve crimes. Together they make a great team. But what makes Victoria Houston's books delightful are the other colorful characters that inhabit Loon Lake and appear, and interfere, in the investigations. If you like blood, guts and testosterone, Victoria's books are not for you. But if you like a puzzle, strange happenings and the characters that go with it, I highly recommend ""Dead Angler""."
3,Good sense of setting,"I enjoyed the writing style and the sense of place. There were several editing errors, including not going to a new paragraph for the next speaker, which made the conversations sometimes hard to follow. There was also too much cursing, although, at least, there were no sex scenes.The characters and place were more prominent than the murder mystery. The mystery held few surprises and was not at all riveting. It was rather mundane. The ending was pretty much a let-down, too. It ended too abruptly after the mystery was solved. It needed a little humor, a little romance, or something more to bring better closure--something to make the reader smile. I won't be archiving this one, and I don't plan to read more by this author."
1,BIG MISTAKE TO BUY,"I bought this product, and listen up!!!! This is NOT ""silicone spray"" made by Liquid Wrench. This is ""Liquid Wrench WITH Silicone"" in it. If you are used to buying WalMart Silicone spray, as I always do, you will notice immediately the strong ""Liquid Wrench"" smell as soon as you spray it. I was greatly surprised of Liquid Wrench that they would FALSELY label there product. If you don't believe me, then, enjoy your liquid wrench with silicone."
1,good fiction - but that's all,"Like one of the other reviewers, I too am an archaeologist (of the Classical sort) but from the statements in the book and the descriptions of the objects (they were displayed on the London Museum website a little while ago - I too wish that there could have been illustrations) I just cannot see how anyone could be so sure that these remains were of a female gladiator. Throughout, the English curators and other academics emphasised caution and even suggested other interpretations (such as the 'incriminating objects' found with her remains being related to her faith or funerary ritual and not her profession - both eminently sensible, I would think) but Zoll seems fixated on a sensationalist approach which has little to do with archaeology and more, I suspect, to do with box-office and book sales. Archaeology is full of good, honest stories so it shouldn't be necessary to tell tall tales!!!"
5,Faint Positive at 9 DPO,"I have tried a couple other early test strips, but I am thrilled with these. I ordered them on the 2nd and they arrived the 8th, short timeframe but it felt like forever. I was so anxious to test that I went against my better judgement and tested that night (9 DPO) with a nearly empty bladder. I got a faint line. I was amazed, so I used a First Response Early Result that I was saving for confirmation. It had a very faint line too. I retested in the morning (10 DPO), and I had faint lines again, but definitely not imagining it. I am high risk, so I'll be using these to monitor my hormone increases, but I highly recommend buying some if you are TTC!"
2,Positive or Negative?,"Positive or Negative? Unfortunately it is still a question you have to ask yourself after taking this test. Though it should be answering this question for you right? I have taken 2 test, 1 yesterday and 1 today and I saw 1 line very bright so I assumed I was negative which wasn't the answer I wanted so I felt disappointed. However, after reading other reviews about the 2nd line being very light, I rechecked both test and there is a very very VERY light line where I assume the 2nd line should be, but it is so very unclear that I can't celebrate a pregnancy when this test still leaves me so unsure. I thought the whole point of a pregnancy test was to positively indicate that I was pregnant not speculate whether I could be even after taking a test. I will have to buy a name brand drug store department test today because these have left me confused."
1,Very thin,"The tests are very very thin, almost impossible to see anything because of how thin producer decided to make a strip. Yes, they are very cheap, but I bought them from a different producer before for the same price and they were not thin and therefore better quality. With these you need to take a magnifying glass to be able to see. Better to charge 5 cents more, but provide good size of a product and make it realy usable."
4,Good but....,"they pick up very small traces of HCG which is good and bad. in my case was bad since i got 3 faint positives one day, the next day a lighter line, then the 3rd day it was gone... i would probably buy them again, but this time probably not get excited until the lines got darker."
1,"Clinical Guard, NOT Wondfo's - FALSE POSITIVES","Look in the gallery at my pics. I got two false positives with these, taken at two different times in the day. A blood test the same day was negative, so it could not have been a chemical pregnancy. These were a HUGE disappointment to me! Do NOT BUY THESE!"
2,Didn't test postive until 5 1/2 weeks along!,"I must have mistaken these strips for the early detection strips, but they weren't even detecting my pregnancy on time. I tested a few times in between 4 weeks and 5 1/2 weeks pregnant and didn't get a positive result until I was 5 1/2 weeks pregnant! I was feeling the fatigue, but thought I was just tired from work. From my experience, it must take a high level of HcG hormone to show a positive on these tests. I would shop around more and find the early detection strips for a few dollars more."
1,Tests received are not tests pictured,"I ordered these and even paid for one-day shipping. They are NOT the tests pictured. They are a different test with which I'm not familiar so I have NO idea how sensitive they are. I HAVE used the tests pictured and am familiar with them. Don't waste your money! Order tests that say from ""WONDFO."""
4,Great,"I'll admit I'm a little paranoid, and with shows like ""I Didn't Know I was Pregnant"" it makes my fears even higher. I bought these as a cheap way to satisfy my freaky fears, and so far they've managed to calm me down without feeling guilty about the pricetag I'd be looking at if I were to go to a pharmacy or grocery store.If I ever decide to have a little jelly bean, I'll be sure to keep these in stock."
1,DID NOT WORK,"I loved the price on these tests, but the ones I got just plain didn't work. I kept testing and thinking that I wasn't pregnant, even though my period was late. Finally I said to myself 'perhaps it has something to do with the ghetto-cheap tests you bought on the internet.' Turns out, it did. I bought a couple tests at the store and they both showed positive. After several more days I tried these strips again and there was still no positive result. Save yourself the hassle."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought it because it was so economical and stated that it was 10 HCG. I was hoping it was able to tell me if I was pregnant by 9dpo. I took it everyday from 7dpo to 11dpo and all were BFN. Something just didn't feel right. I had symptoms of sore bb's and I had cramps. I took FRER test the same day and BFP! I am veryyyyy disappointed with this product! Do not buy it!
5,Where have these been hiding!?,"Perfection. Affordable price, and just what I need! These are great if you're on a special cycle of birth control that limits your period to 3 or 4 times a year. You need to test and be sure everything is working. They're very accurate, and it certainly beats using the big brands from the store that are 10-16 bucks a pop.Love love love this product!"
1,Buyers beware!!!!,"These give false positives...after loosing my son in July at 17 wks and then ttc since sept, it is hard when you get your hopes up when you see a nice line on your wondofo...then later find out after several positives that is neg. I know some people say that I might have had a chemical, but no....it didn't even detect my pregnancy this cycle yet clear blue digital did. The lot # that I have is W00120694-3 exp 06/2014"
3,You get what you pay for!,"These came promptly. They were individually packaged. Much smaller than the picture seems to show. They are a little hard to read, but all in all a good purchase for the price."
1,Thin Line False Positive,"I've ordered two batches of these tests now, and both of them contain tests that show a thin ""positive"" line within seconds of the pee hitting it. Looks like a legit positive, but after three months in a row (and 5 bad tests out of 50) of this, I'm done. I'm going back to tests from early-pregnancy-tests. They're more expensive, but I've never gotten a false positive with them."
2,Got a line on my first test!,"I used this test for the first time last week. I was 10dpo and got a very faint positive line! I was skeptical, but thrilled that I may finally be pregnant. My period came the next day. So although I think it was a fluke, it was disappointing."
1,did not get what i paid for''',"Hi...I usually don't write reviews ..but this time I felt like I had to ....I order these Wondfo Pregnancy Test Strips, 25-count...after reading the other reviews and looking ...I thought these were going to be 25-count (Blue) strips ..for early pregnancy test results ...I ended up receiving the pink..color stips ..which did not decet any pregnany ..I still had to go out and get a test from pharmcy....:)not happy with the product...save your money and go get a first-respond pregnancy test from local drugstore...Baby dust for Everyone..:)"
5,Good Purchase- Unexpected Prenancy,"Although I shop at amazon.com all the time, I rarely write reviews. This product got me to take time off my crazy schedule to tell all the women out there in the same scenario, give this product a chance. For the price, you get an extremely accurate product. I was shocked my test were positive, as I've never been pregnant nor was trying to get pregnant. I took several other more expensive test and they were all positive. Buy with confidence ladies!"
5,The best preg tests on the market for the price - period!!,These really are your best bet for pregnancy tests. An amazing value and amazingly accurate. I had a BFP on day 12 dpo from a Wondfo test that was 2 months expired! I was nervous about its accuracy so I bought another pack back in September. Happy to say they were correct :) I am currently 13 and a half weeks pregnant. Don't waste your money in the drug stores - stock up on these!
2,Count them!,"I ordered two of the 25 count wondfo pregnancy tests and when I got them there were only 46 in there, so make sure you count then when you recieve your order. I haven't used even one of them yet.. I hope they can send me the rest of my order. I'm kind-of disappointed."
2,Bad batch,"I had ordered this product before and was very happy with them. This batch that I just got is horrible. The tests are full of indents and pits, making it impossible to read the results. I guess if you had a blaring positive it wouldn't be so bad but when you have a faint positive, it's nearly impossible to read. Plus, the dye doesn't clear all the way through making it even harder to read.I'm hoping I just got a bad batch, it would be great if the company would replace them but I have no clue how to contact them."
3,Ordered Wondfo and got ClinicalGuard,I ordered 25 ct Wondfo Pregnancy Test Strips and received ClinicalGuard strips 2 days late. I couldn't resist and bought a FirstResponse kit from Target before receiving these. FirstResponse gave positive result with two sharp pink lines within a minute. When I received ClinicalGuard strips .. these were too tiny .. difficult to hold and test. But results were positive but slower than FirstResponse. I liked FirstResponse better than these (ClinicalGuard).
5,+HPT 10DPO!,"I have heard that the ""internet cheapies"" can be less sensitive than the more expensive store bought brands. Although very faint, I received my first positive test with these 10DPO. I Highly recommend these tests."
4,Loud Rock N Roll w/ Faith-centered lyrics,"A great blend of loud, grungy rock-n-roll tastefully blended with thoughtful & personal faith-centered lyrics. The lead vocalist, Vince Lichlyter, has an awesome gravelly baritone voice that fits this style hand-in-glove. This is rock and roll to rattle your windows with.""Faith Like That"" is far-and-away THE standout track on this disc, even though it's mellower than many of the songs surrounding it. This song, and the CD's closing songs, show that this band can also handle the softer tunes with talent and taste.This whole CD is a fantastic first album, and reveals that Jonah33 has huge potential. I look forward to seeing them grow as songwriters and musicians in the future. For now though, buy this CD and set your volume to 11."
5,"blood, guts and gore on stage","This book proves that Hollywood writers and directors weren't the ones who invented Horror, it was the Grand Guignol theatre and its playwrights."
4,"Good book, lots of theory, examples...","This is a pretty good book. There are lots of examples andtheory, however the detailed explinations of circuits justaren't there. You need to be pretty well versed in basicelectronic theory before picking up this book."
2,Disappointed.,"This is the only protector I've tried, so I have nothing to compare it too, but I felt I did my research and this appeared to be better than most of the thin film protectors. I followed the directions in installing it on my G7. It was a clean and easy install. However; I've noticed three days after installing it, there is one corner that has worked loose and will not reapply. So far, this isn't a problem as I still have protection for the entire monitor, but I wonder how long the protector will remain functional. I think the Giottos SP8252 is the way to go as it is a glass protector with antiglare coating."
4,Song titles in this book,"Here's a list of all the song titles in this book:Auntie Maggies Remedy, Chinese Laundry Blues, Fanlight Fanny, Frigid Air Fanny, Hindoo Man, I Blew A Little Blast On My Whistle, In My Little Snapshot Album, It's A Grand And Healthy Life, Leaning On A Lamp Post, Like The Big Pots Do, Little Ukulele, Mother Whatll I Do Now, Noughts And Crosses, On The Wigan Boat Express, Sitting On The Ice In The Ice Rink, Sitting On The Top Of Blackpool Tower, Swimmin With The Wimmin, The Lancashire Toreador, Theres Nothing Proud About Me, When I'm Cleaning Windows, Why Don't Woman Like Me, With My Little Stick Of Blackpool Rock"
5,The shoe I come back to.,"I wear these shoes everyday and I am on my feet most of the day. I have tried different shoes and I always come back to these. They last me about 5-6 months. Once the insole support is gone, I have to get a new pair. Aftermarket inserts don't work. It would be nice if they had a little more ventilation as they get hot when the weather is warmer. Good traction on ice and snow."
5,Great Shoes,"I'm somewhat of a connoisseur of shoes. I like to have shoes for every occasion. Sometimes you just want a good white shoe to wear. This fits the bill.Pros:ComfortableWhiteStable, in case you need to play a game of basketball or somethingCons:White, so once they get dirty beyond a certain point, there's no cleaning them well enough, so you may as well get a new pair"
4,A Helpful Textbook,"I decided to assign this book for my class, Shakespeare on Film, and am satisfied with it. This is a good overview of how Shakespeare's plays have been adapted to film, and is clearly written. The coverage is excellent."
2,judge this book by its COVER!!! Horrible!!!,"This book contains 224 pages. Pictures take up quite a few pages. Lots have been on the news for a long while. Some stuff is already on the internet for the public to read!!!!! Amber brought out some facts about her family and childhood that I have not heard about. Being betrayed, Frey talks about a few difficult months during the trial on SCOTT PETERSON. I was sorry for her, especially since she revealed to have gone out with Scott. Her words were a repeat of the trial testimony. I am glad that Amber Frey helped to convict a murderer. Thanks to her. Bad thing is, this book is dissapointing and dull and flat. The publisher rushed this book and it is obvious, especially sicne the trial only ended a little more than a month ago."
1,Bought it and took it back...i should have known...,"it would be so damn boring. My whole interest was in Laci and all Amber goes on about is her and Scott, everything basically i got already from Courttv...in book form. It sucks do not buy it instead get Ann Bird's for her perspective and then Catherine Crier's for the court's perspective. Amber was a no body until she profitted from a few one night stands with a cheating babykiller and a beautiful and missed lady and her baby. She should be ashamed of this book...witch."
2,O.K. BOOK IF YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE CASE,"This book was o.k. It is not too informative however. You don't learn anything different from what you've seen or heard in the media. I feel bad for Amber, but I feel even worse for Laci's family. This whole book is about ""poor Amber"". Yes, Scott was a real jerk and a compulsive liar, but there are lots of guys like that in the world."
1,Junk,"Just a money maker for another ""victim of society who slept with the wrong guy.No one will believe the vivid dreams she claims she had, and no one feels sorry for someone who kept contact with this guy even after the cops left her home.She was after the cash on this one. DOesn't come across as a really bright individual."
4,Amber has a right to tell her story,"I cannot say I enjoyed this book as I too was a victim of a narcissist/psychopath and to read about Scott Peterson's lies and manipulation of Amber was a trip down memory lane for me. Amber has been ridiculed and her character assassinated because she fell so quickly for Scott Peterson, but unless you have experience with one of these personalities, you cannot possibly judge her or understand. Do I think Amber made some mistakes, big and small, yes. I have compassion for her as a somewhat naive young woman caught up in a tragedy not of her own making. It was interesting to get some background on her and helped me to understand why she made some of the poor choices with men that she has made. I applaud her for having the courage to come forward and assist law enforcement at great personal cost."
4,Job well done Amber,"I thought that Amber did a good job on this book. I live in the bay area, and have heard about the case since Laci was missing. Every detail about this case has been broadcast, and there was still a lot of things that I was surprised to read about. I also liked that fact that I could read it on one sitting (4 hours). It wasn't drawn out at all, it was to the point. I think Amber is a brave lady, and I didn't mind spending the money I did to buy this book. She has two kids to support, and poor thing has lost all of her privacy over this. I think it shows how strong she is to have to deal with Scott for over a month just trying to get more info as to Laci's whereabouts. She could have stopped it earlier, but she sincerely wanted to bring Laci & Conner home."
1,Dumb Blond Makes Millions,"I would not deem low enough to buy this book so I read it at the public library. As I was reading this money making piece of junk, that interestly came out right after the verdict, I saw it as a base piece of exploitation of the judicial system.The book screams: Let's write a book and make loads of money.I was simply disgusted. The contents of the book itself? Boring, hackneyed, nothing that I did not already know. Book was rushed. Don't waste your time and money!!!(...)"
1,Trash,"She readily admits that this book is to secure a future for her children. It's all about money, and it would take a fool not to see that she saw dollar signs in Scott, too. Now she bemoans HIS motives? Puhleeeeze.I wish I had read the reviews and seen Oprah before I laid out money for this garbage. It's hypocritical, thrown together, has extremely poor editing, and reflects immaturity and intelligence levels of the author that boggle the mind. If you saw her on Oprah, or any of her other interviews, you realize that she can't put two words together, much less a coherent response to the questions of interviewers. Likewise, her attempts in this book for sympathy fall flat. She quotes the Bible, yet sprinkles the book with her own obscenities. I wonder if she's considered another Bible lesson: ""You REAP what you SOW""? But then, Scott wasn't looking for a Christian OR intelligent conversation, hmm? This book proves he had found the right gal. Enough said."
3,Over and over again,"If you like reading the same thing over and over again, this is the book for you. In Witness, For the Prosection of Scott Peterson, the author Amber Frey describes her relationship with Scott Peterson. She tells of the telephone conversations between the two and how he has affected her life. Amber is in connection with the Modesto Police Department trying to get information to them about Scott having a connection to the murder of his pregnant wife Laci and his unborn child Conner. I would recommend this book if you were not able to follow the trial in the beginning."
4,A horrible experience,"I read this book in about 2 days. One should really step away from the media circus and the trial and read this book, and I mean really read it. Too many are quick to say she is just some ""dumb blonde bimbo"" without really understanding the whole thing from her perspective. What happened to her reminds us all too vividly that we are human, and that we are susceptible to conmen like Scott Peterson, and we don't want to admit it. Here's a quote from her book, from one of her church friends, ""Amber, the only difference between you and everybody else is that your life is on public display. We all have skeletons in our closets."" How true!She saw the white fella on the horse and thought she had a wonderful chance to be happy. But he wasn't the fella on the white horse, he was the wolf in sheep's clothing. It took a lot of guts for her to come out with the story. She could have sold out to the tabloids but she didn't. She should get some credit for her actions."
1,Unfortunate,"It is unfortunate that, as one of Ms. Frey's acknowledgements reads, she was allowed to ""tell my story, my way."" It is about two paragraphs away from being a coloring book.She shied away from any in-depth revelation of her relationship with Peterson which is, after all, exactly and wholly what she had to offer. In other words; ""the dirt"", ""the skinny"", the details on what he said and did in the privacy of their relationship that might give us a window into how his warped mind worked."
4,Almost ashamed to say I liked it,"I have to say, I did like this book. The other reviewers are correct in saying there is not a ton of new information here if you were following the case in the media. But it read like a woman telling her girlfriend all about this guy she met, and that was fun. It's a very easy read, and kept me interested until the end. If you need something to pass the time on a flight, this is a great choice. But, really for women only. I don't think men would get past the first page."
4,Martin the Cobbler,"This is a great video. I'm using it in our Sunday School program, and the kids have enjoyed it. The accent is a bit tough for the younger kids to make out, but other than that, it's been a hit. Thanks!"
4,Time Bandits - Dubbelgoud,A fantastic compilation of this bands works including all tracks from 'Fiction' & 'Can't wait for another world' albums along with the more popular early works (I'm only shooting love .... etc). Sadly didn't include the bands first single 'Reach Out' or any remixed/extended versions but very good value for money nontheless.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this item for my kindle, hoping it would have phantom of the opera sheet music in it.first, i do not like the summary, because it names a few songs then says ""and many more"". there is no list of songs, to tell you if the song you wanted was in it.so i bought the item, and opened it. second problem occured when the e-book had a lot of trouble opening.third problem, when it finally did open, it was blurry, small, and you could not read the sheetmusic. you could try to largen the sheet music, but it did nothing.the next day, i called Amazon, and got my money back, because this e-book is a big waste of time, money, and space on the kindle."
5,Simple Life Review,"All of the seasons of Simple Life were good. Very funny show. Still the best reality show ever! Fans have their favorite seasons, but all of the seasons are good and worth watching! We love it!Thanks,Paris Hilton News and Reviews"
5,fits 6.5,"Works on the 6.5 also, glad i got it saved money didn't want to go all over the place to find this rare item so glad it was online"
1,Below Expected Standards,"Although I loved the cast, the material was WAY beneath their usual brilliant resumes. What a waste. For true fans only. I for one had to get it because I am a fan, but I cannot recommend it in good faith. Good luck."
3,Maintains Interest,"Those not familiar with the Sibelius Seventh are missing a little gem--brief, somewhat enigmatic, but beautiful and stimulating, the Seventh yields new treasures each time it is carefully auditioned, and given a performance and a recording standard as high as this version, the listener will surely want to listen oven and over again. This two-CD set also includes a couple of tone poems and a version of the sprawling Kullervo Symphony for orchestra and voices, a work which can seem overly long in some recordings but which Davis seems to shape in such a way as to maintain musical interest. A warm, slightly distant recording by Tony Faulkner, very nice on the ears."
1,Hits & Rarities ?Singles A's & B's,"Terrible sound quality! I have most of these songs in other CDs and there is a discernable negative difference in the quality of this CD. If you want to buy a good Move Album buy ""Shazam"" other wise buyer beware!"
2,I expected more,"This film was recommended by a friend as being one of the best romentic films made. Well, maybe in it's time it was but it didn't do a thing for me."
1,not recommended,"The book lays out how to trade an uptrending, downtrending or range bound channel. It asks for the practitioner of it's methodology to believe in the nature of price to move from one end of a channel to another and to do so quite often. I found the channels to be subjectively drawn and of no value. That describes the first 2/3 of the book.The final 1/3 of the book is a mish-mash of nonsense concerning Gann angles and a ton of other subjective nonsense. I do not recommend this book."
2,No instructions and not that sensitive,"I know you think you're getting amazing deal for some super sensitive tests right? Nope. It is a good deal, but the tests aren't that sensitive. I took multiple tests and First Response & Clearblue Easy Digital gave me clearer to read results. I got a REALLY faint positive on these.Also with no instructions, I ended up wasting multiple tests by over dipping. You can find them online but there was no indication of that in the package. I didn't find them until today. All this time I was using urine that was too hot (needs to settle 5 mins and be room temp) and dipping it for waaaaaay longer than necessary.Maybe if you're more experience, these are just fine, but for someone on her first pregnancy, they just didn't work out well for me."
4,What a fun collection,"This is a collection of the Film Board of Canada's best graphic film shorts drawn by supurb artists with interesting insights, beautifully presented."
3,fun game but didn't keep her attention for long,Got this to play with my 3 year old daughter who LOVES games... didn't keep her attention for long and she basically just wanted to play with it and not do the game. Maybe she was a little too young.
3,Eggs don't stay together,"This is a fun game, but two of my eggs don't stay together well at all. The slightest shake of the spoon and they pop open, causing them to fall."
5,Great for kids of all ages and ability levels,"We have a special needs 3.5 year old and this toy is awesome not only for her but also for her typical friends and 6.5 year old brother. I love the size, great for little ones or special needs kids. I am buying another set to give to my daughter's special needs preschool classroom."
4,You can get vertual experiences in Pulmonary Medicine,"This book mentioned case studies for medical students, residents, pulmonary fellows, internists, and other health professionals. The readers can get vertual experiences in Pulmonary Medicine. This book will be your strong weapon to solve the problem in your medical practice. Enjoy your vertual medical experiences with this literature for the treatment of your patients with respiratory illness!"
3,good but missing some essentials,"This book has a great format with interesting case studies involving a number of respiratory conditions, however if you are looking for a thorough examination of respiratory disease, this is not where you will find it. It is completely lacking case studies involving Pulmonary Embolism and Pulmonary Hypertension-- two topics you probably don't want to miss. Overall, a good introductory text with clinical applications and a ""big picture"" approach to respiratory disease."
2,COMPLAIN,My name is peter mbuthia .ABOUT SIX WEEKS I HAD BOUGHT THE BOOK FROM AMAZON BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE BOOK IT IS HARD TO REVIEW THE PRODUCT IF I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCTCAN SOME BODY TELL ME WHOM I NEED TO TALK TO SO THAT I CAN GET THE PRODUCT OR MY MONEY BACK
3,Very large!!,"I have a different version of this car seat, and we own a Toyota RAV4. The seat worked great when she was little, but now that my daughter has gotten bigger (she's 3) her legs reach up to my headrest. Because this seat is so elevated, when she stretches her legs out, she is kicking me in the head. It's very frustrating. I wish it wasn't so tall. Plus, picking her up to put her in it, or take her out can be difficult (like if she fell asleep somewhere) because she now weighs 37 lbs. Well, you have to LIFT her to put her in it. Now, keep in mind, we have this installed in the middle of the back seat. If she was on either side, this wouldn't be a problem. But, even when she's awake, she has to CLIMB into it. Also, the foam that surrounds her head broke very easily when I hit it wrong one time lifting a sleeping baby into it. We are now replacing it with a Graco Nautilus. I already like it better! This seat is much lower."
4,I'm prejudice,Don't count on my review - I have a friend on this show so anything they do is SUPER with me.
1,Sickly lame...,"I gotta say, I'm glad they created GHI. It took every investigator that I hated from the original series and sent them to the other side of the world. Thank God! I hate that these idiots have their own show, but at least they aren't ruining the great one anymore."
3,Eye Opener,Really opened my eyes to how little I apparently pay attention. My goal is to change this. When we first met and were married I knew all these quirky things and now I know very little. Too much attention on the kids I guess.
5,SO FUN!! I ORDERED IT FOR MY INLAWS MARRIED 45 YEARS,MY HUSBAND AND I WERE BEST FRIENDS FOR 13 YEARS BEFORE WE MARRIED. WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED 3 YEARS... I ORDERED THESE BASED ON THEIR REVIEW. SO FUN!! HE WASN'T TO FIRED UP ABOUT IT INITIALLY BUT ONCE WE GOT STARTED IT MADE FOR AN EVENING FULL OF LAUGHS!! :) WE ORDERED THEM FOR HIS PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN MARRIED 45 YEARS... BET THEY SCORE BETTER THAN AN 855!!
4,Questions answered,Not only is the book well written and easily read but it answers many questions that have been asked for a century. Actually the subject matter is so arcane that the book answers many questions that were never asked. Well done Mr. Lavopa.
2,The de-glorification of the person of Jesus Christ,"I want to start off by saying that I found many things which this author explained helpful, but I can't ignore the fact that this book largely ignores, and at times de-glorifies the person of Jesus Christ [i.e., His sonship and deity]For example:""Moreover, Jesus, in an effort to suppress any sort of personality cult, warned against calling him ""Lord, Lord."" - Pg. 201The author shows here that at best he does not understand the context of Jesus' words in Luke 6:46, or at worse ignores it just to ""prove"" his point. I recommend this book only for its parallelisms."
4,"Finally, Steven King's ""The Shining"" :)!","Years ago, after watching and enjoying Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", I bought the Steven King novel and found it both a different and more powerful story. It was only a couple weeks ago I learned a more faithful version was available on film, so I watched it and it does indeed stay far closer to the novel. True, it's less spectacular than Kubrick's relatively glossy and hyper effort, but if you enjoyed the novel, definitely check out the miniseries. Both films are worth viewing, but keep in mind that what Steven King wrote is a very different thing from what Stanley Kubrick filmed, don't confuse them.Note: This is a three episode anamorphic 16:9 widescreen presentation with commentary -- each episode occupying a single DVD side (side four being blank). Total duration is 273 minutes and although the picture is a little on the soft side, it's not excessively so. The DD2.0 sound track quality is just fine."
4,old-fashioned movie,I enjoyed the old-fashioned straightforward story of romance and music. This movie can be watched by adults and youth alike.
3,Not What I Expected,"After reading the reviews for this movie, I purchased it and I have to say I was disappointed. It had several curse words scattered throughout, which made me cringe as they were not needed in this otherwise clean film. It was a good story, nice happy ending, but this is not something I would keep in my collection."
3,Arrived Broken,"I haven't watched the movie yet, but it looks like a good story, since I am a fan of both Amy Grant and stringed instruments (my daughter is a violinist). It also looks like the story has a good message. I've been a fan of Amy's for 25 years, so I figured I couldn't really go wrong. However, it arrived broken. The damage was minor, so I did not return it. The part that holds the DVD in place broke off and the DVD just bounces around the case. It's annoying, but it was too minor and too much of a hassle to return it."
5,Isserlis and Hough are always the best,"If you've never heard the Grieg cello sonata, please go buy this recording. It's worth it simply to hear Isserlis's beautiful execution of this work. But every track is well worth listening too, and it's hard to imagine that the Rubinstein and Liszt pieces could be neglected once enough people listen to this recording. The title of ""Romance"" refers to a style of music, not an imperative for the listener; Isserlis and Hough are never sappy, forced or unclear in their musical intentions. Rather, they are two of the world's best chamber artists achieving flawless blend and unity of expression in these unjustly neglected works."
5,Forget the stupid camera man and concentrate on the wonderful performance.,"This is a beautiful production sung and acted out by a fantastic cast.Unfortunately the film director was an idiot and marred an otherwise 10-star performance. As it is, still 5 stars.Not only did Jonas Kaufmann gave a terrific performance in the title role; the sisters Charlotte and Sophie are both vocally very beautiful, the Sophie especially outstanding, and the husband Albert wonderfully portrayed by the great French baritone Ludovic Tezier, a grossly underrated singer.Kaufmann's Werther is not a light-voiced one, but he is so moving that makes you wonder why hitherto only lyrical tenors were casted in this role?The stage setting is romantic and beautiful. To downgrade such performance by side issues is really putting the cart before the horse, and misses the critical issues horribly."
5,Emotionally devastating,"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. Kaufmann is beyond wonderful, the conducting is superb and so is everything else. Only the videography might be faulted. It roves all over the place, sticking its nose in where it has no business going. Production is -- surprise! -- not egomaniacal ""director's theater"" despite many fine dramatic touches"
5,"Zero Tolarence; and, not all remembered correctly.","I skated with Toller, as a principal, at Radio City Music Hall in the production of ICE, in New York City. I must admit that this book is extremely entertaining!! A must read for figure skaters and fans. But I was there! And though Toller said there was no closing night party, there was. Toller and I were there along with Peggy Flemming, Robin Cousins, and the rest of the cast. Plus, its producer: Bob Shipstad and choreographer: Sara Kawahara and pair skater, soon to become one of skatings most innovative producers and choreographers, Sandra Bezic.But anything Toller writes is his interpretation, which is slightly different to what actually happened. Still, take it with a grain of salt -- and enjoy. I think Toller is one of the greatest skaters -- of any era. And perhaps the most esoteric skater of all time. I'll buy anything he writes and enjoy (if not agree)every word. His books are hilarious and witty."
3,A few design oversights...,"I've purchased 2 of these cases and like how all my equipment can stay together. However, I wish there were some sort of outlet for the power jack when the player is in place--as it is, one corner of the player is always popped up over the edge of the case to accomodate the plug for the power. Also, the pocket for extra cables, DVDs, etc is up against the headrest, and so can never lie flat against the headrest if there's anything in the pocket...I think the pocket would be better situated on the bottom of the case to allow the headrest portion to lay flat. All said, this is a convenient case and I think it is available at a fair price."
5,Perfect,"My grandson loves this. Once he gets all buckled into his car seat, he reaches over and lifts the lid to get his favorite DVD playing. Really great for long car rides."
4,Portable DVD Player Case,"Very fast shipping; quality not quite what I expected but will suffice for what it will be used for, especially considering the price. Would purchase again."
2,Will do.,"Okay little case just to protect dvd player when not in use. Functional on the headrest set up if you have lots of patience. This item was on sale, if full price would not purchase."
2,DVD Case,It wasn't what I thought I was buying but ok. It fits the DVD player I bought but I was hoping it was alittle bigger. It really is designed to anchor to the seats in a car. The storage compartment is too small. If you want to store all the accessories it is pretty tight. I would aim a little bigger.
3,Doesn't work on XP!,"Lots of bugs, can't get past the first screen! The notes say if your cd-rom is too fast it can cause problems (no kidding!), but the fix doesn't work."
3,poorly designed stand,"The globe itself is ok and has a lot of educational value for kids starting out in geography, but the stand is so poorly designed that when you rotate the globe on its axis, the stand easily detaches from the globe. The whole point is to be able to rotate it, so in effect it's not very usable if you have to keep fixing the stand again and again. A heavier stand that would not move when rotating the globe would probably work better. The attaching mechanism needs redesign too -- right now it's just a screw in the base."
3,Stand is a disappointment...,The globe itself is great. My daughter received this for Christmas and she just loves to find different places on her globe. The only problem is the stand. It is just screwed on at the bottom of the stand and we have to keep trying to tighten it up. They really should have made the stand better to with-stand children picking it up and actually using it. Other then the stand it is a great globe.
2,Roger Whittaker - The Christmas Song - CD,"It seemed. that for most of the songs, Roger was waiting to get in on the act whilst the constant bells and choir went on and on.Most of the songs were in the wrong tempo. The whole tape was like a poor rehearsal.Roger should have just sung as he always has, until now, brilliantly.He is my most favourite Singer, still.Barry Mayfield"
1,Did not fit my bed frames,I have returned the items purchased because they did not fit my bed frames. I have not yet received information that I have received a refund. The items appeared to be of good quality but not a fit for what we needed.
1,Not for my dog...,"I returned this before I even let my dog see it. I may have missed it in the description, but there is a large square, plastic box (I'm assuming battery powered) inside the toy that makes it ""ribbit"". Simply put, if I wouldn't chew on it...my dogs not going to chew on it. That box inside is all corners and I can't imagine it being fun to chew on."
2,Small,"Smaller than I expected and not the same frog that I was trying to replace. The shape is odd also, almost ball shaped. Our dog isn't pleased with it either, I will be taking the voice box out and placing it into the old, much loved frog."
3,Marti Webb was better,"I love Bernadette--but she always breaks the microphone. She's MUCH BETTER live. When will someone learn to record her properly? The Marti Webb version of this show is rougher, but much better. Still, Bernadette's ""Married Man"" breaks my heart. The Sarah Brightman version was probably the most in character, as she's such a princess--but her nasil-y singing drives me up the chalkboard."
5,The greatest version out there!,"This performance is so well done, and it's only Bernadette Peters who sheds all the chilling emotions into it. Neither Sarah Brightman (""Tell Me on a Sunday"" TV version, London) nor Marti Webb (London Original Cast) can come close to this performance. It's Bernadette that Cameron Macintosh and Andrew Lloyd Webber always ask when they do their spectacular musical revues (check out ""Cam's Hey Mr. Producer,"" and ""Andrew Lloyd-Webber's ""Celebration Live at the Royal Albert Hall""...it's Bernadette Peters they always ask to do ""Unexpected Song,"" which is perhaps one of Andrew's best compositions ever. I personally prefer ""Tell Me on a Sunday,"" and only as performed by Bernadette. This album was out-of-print toward the latter 80's and early 90's, and I almost got a heart attack when I saw it re-released by the mid-90's. Thank God! It's an album of Bernadette you just can't live without. Just superb!"
5,Bernadette is fabulous,"Buy this disc for the wonder that is Bernadette Peters. I can take or leave the music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, but the singing is some Ms. Peter's best."
1,A New Kind of Scam,"This book contains only 2 pages of writing. The remaining pages are all blank. The ""reader"" is supposed to write the book for the author and then send it back. I see that the ""author"" David Rising (if that is his real name), has just ""authored"" a similar ""journal"" called Paranormal: Journal. Don't waste your money, buy a diary instead."
4,Arthur Fiedler Rides Again!,"If you grew up with the Boston Pops under the direction of Arthur Fiedler (like I did)...this Christmas music should come as NO SURPRISE to you. It's basically a composite of the three Arthur Fiedler/Boston Pops Christmas Lps with a few extra unrelated tracks (by The Canadian Brass) thrown in. If you've been listening to the older Lps, Cassettes and god forbid--the 8tracks)for the last several years..this update wouldn't hurt! Nobody performs ""A CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL""/""RUDOLPH""/""SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN""/""WHITE CHRISTMAS"" and ""WINTER WONDERLAND"" like Maestro Fiedler and The Pops. ""SLEIGH RIDE"" (by Leroy Anderson) is the definitive version. Pop this in your CD player during the holiday season...you'll receive several positive comments from family and friends."
1,7burgessalmost8,"DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!! I realize these are under $5 for $15, but I have used 5 now and I have not gotten a clear positive! Well at least if I didn't already know I was pregnant! Our insurance does not go into affect until Jan. I just found out I was pregnant with our 6th a week ago. I bought these so I could keep track that my hormones were rising like they should be. The positive lines I have been getting are so light it is very hard to see. Plus mine I got looked nothing like the ones pictured. I decided I needed to go get some from the store, went and got First Response. Came home took the test and the positive line showed up right away, just as dark as the test strip! I got 3 of those for $7. I know you get more in this set, but if they don't work........."
4,Nice Job!,"I have all the ice guides to colorado, and this one is about the only one I trust. Ratings are, in my experience, slightly conservative, which is better than being the other way, particularly for ice climbs where getting in over your head can be very serious. Route information is, for all the routes in the book I've done, very accurate."
4,pretty good,"I found this to be a pretty good guide. There is a lot of ice that is not covered by the book. But, what is covered is described pretty well."
5,excellent value,"Audio clarity was excellent. This is a good value for the money.Very nostalgic, big band sound was excellent with good coordination with excellent singer."
4,More than just good pop music,"After 30 years of listening to music (mostly progressive rock and heavy metal), I find that I also enjoy Demis's albums from the 70's. This is undoubtedly some of the best popular music ever produced (along with Abba, maybe). One of my favorites is his first, ""On The Greek Side Of My Mind."" It is significantly less pop-influenced than his other albums and even has some progressive rock elements (no surprise since Demis was in Aphrodite's Child with Vangelis). The album flows very well and is an enjoyable listen, start to finish. Now if only we can get a label somewhere to reissue ""My Only Fascination"" from 1974, we'd be in pretty good shape."
2,A logbook,"Byron Curtis is a well-prepared kayaker who paddles down much of the Mississippi. Other than the scale of the trip, he takes few risks. And since he rarely gets out of his boat, and never for any length of time, he relates few interesting experiences. The terrorist attacks which happened while he was on his trip could have provided something to write about, especially later in his trip when people seem increasingly suspicious of him. However, he never explores this or any topic in depth here.Someone may find the campsite coordinates and packing list useful, however that content itself doesn't seem like enough to justify a full-length book."
5,Outstanding,This series has total potential to become one of the best vampire series to ever hit the selves.
1,"""Glad I bought just one""",I am an avid reader and fan of the vampire and paranormal genre. I do not find books I dont like or dont finish but this is a first. I tried several times to finish this book and couldnt. I was going to order several of Hart's books at once and I am glad I didn't. Save your money on this series.
3,Not exactly the keys to the palace...,"I got this book from the library; used one source of recommended reading material from the official DANTES website, specifically the text called ""Understanding Business"" by Nickels and McHugh (great book; it's all you need.) I took 3 weeks to study; took the test today and scored a 64 (takes a 46 to pass.) LOTS of extraneous info in the DANTES study guide--you'll never see most of it on the test (I saw maybe 15%) but it gets the mind primed in the right direction. The Understanding Business text was perfect though. Read the summary's at the end of each chapter in the business text; take 6 to 10 tests in the DANTES study guide and go pass the test (you will.)"
2,The Biggest Hurt,"These recordings were made for Audiograph Records, they are not the original Columbia Recordings. 8 of the tracks are from Barbara's 1982 album The Biggest Hurt. The only Barbara Fairchild compilation issued on CD to contain the original Columbia recordings of ""Teddy Bear Song,"" ""Color My World, ""Cheatin' Is,"" ""Kid Stuff"" and ""Baby Doll"" was Classic Country on the Simitar label. That compilation, although out of print, is far superior and relatively easy to find used."
2,pass on buying this pillow,"I would pass on this pillow. It isn't comfortable and doesn't hold the air well once it's inflated. This pillow, Lewis N. Clark Original Neckrest Inflatable Pillow, is much better."
3,"Good value, but very small capacity","For this price, you really can't complain. However the boxes are very small - capacity for several smaller pills only. Too small to hold my daily multi-vitamin pills."
3,I was an OK Book!,"It is not what I was looking for, I wanted more of a german-dutch-amish dictionary.This is English Spoken with a amish Acsent or whatever . Not what I was looking for . But the DUTCH-ified ENGLISH Might be ok for some people"
4,DMSO,"I use it more as a detox and preventative element and thusly I really have no dramatic notification of any sudden results that it may or may not have encouraged. Otherwise, it does do what is claimed in terms of penetration and taste."
3,DMSO Roll-On,"Jury is still out on this one too - have severe back pain due to lumbar spine degeneration. So far, only ice & Bio-Freeze Menthol works on relieving some of the pain along with Ibuprofen, which I don't want to take too much of...DMSO does cause skin to get really hot, so it does generate blood flow to the area. Will keep using to see if it does what it's supposed to. LOVE the roll-on applicator - makes it SO much easier to apply!"
4,Very good book lots of info and very easy to use it explains the rifle in great detail,this book has a lot of usefull information in it on the serial number and what is correct with that serial number
5,Baby Einstein: Baby da Vinci - My Body (Tabbed Board Book),This little board book is so cute! It is larger than I expected which is a wonderful surprise:) My little 3 month old loves touching and turning the pages as I read to him. Five star rated and well worth it.
2,Boring...,My son is so bored by this book by the time we get to the 3rd or 4th page. EVERY SINGLE PAGE just has a mirror and the text asks if you can look at your [instert body part here] in the mirror.
4,Great starting club and a strong performer,Bought this as a replacement for a set I've had nearly 10 years. I lost one of my original clubs. They hold up to drops and scratches very well and are solid and well weighted. Great for beginners or as a practice club.
4,EVA DRY PETITE ELECTRIC DEHUMIDIFIER,"I wanted to post this review after reading alot of complaints of unit being ""Noisy""I ordered one and after 1 mo. it started getting really noisy"" i opened up the unit and noticed it has a fan like and computer desktop would have, it looked like a cheapie chinese model so i went to Fry's and bought a fan for $5 bucks and replaced it.A slight mod will have to be done as the connectors dont match. I just spliced the wires and used electrical tape, and wall ah"" Whisper quiet unit!I understand most people wont want to do this and perhaps you shouldnt especially if the unit is new, but thats what i did to resolve the noisy issue. Other than that the unit works great!"
2,Great while it worked,This worked well for about 2 months and then it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I spent $40 on something that broke shortly after.
4,It is what it is.,"Look. This isn't a big dehumidifier that will suck out all the water from the air. But if you live in an moist area this thing could work for a small room. I'm a freshman in college in South Carolina and this thing sucks out 200-300 mL from the area per 24 hour period.It doesn't make the air feel like it does with a full sized dehumidifier, but it improves it a lot, and a little goes a long way. If I come into the room after not being in it for a long time, it's very noticeable and very nice. However, when I am in a lot, the room can still feel a little humid.The noise is not really noticeable, it's a little hum. The AC unit in my dorm is a good bit louder than it, but admittedly that unit is pretty old. I have no trouble sleeping with it on, and it's right below my bed. You could probably sleep better, in fact, since I at least find it hard to sleep when it's humid."
5,Great product,"I ordered this after reading all the reviews on this and others like it. I am so pleased with my purchase. We have a fairly small bathroom and it sure does the trick on those humid days. I really like how it assists in drying out the shower after use as well as the wet towels. No more musty, wet, mildew smells in the bathroom either."
4,-Works Like A Charm-,"I purchased quite a few of these little guys and have had no problems whatsoever. I read reviews here and several people said that they were loud, etc. Well, they must have supersonic hearing because I disagree. The amount of moisture/water these things are able to collect is just astounding. Highly Recommended!!"
1,Eva dry Electric Petitie Dehumidifer,To be honest its not what i thought it was I really was in disapointment cause of the size i mean it did say petite but geee could it hav gotten ne small wow & then for the price i shold have jus saved my money it really was a waste of money really i probably wont buy ne thing from u again ;(
4,Does the job!,"I got the Eva-dry in December of 2008 and I've been using it ever since. I put it in my bathroom because we don't have any windows (the ceilings are low too). I think it'll only be good for small spaces. It seems to work well for us. The entire dehumidifier fills up within a little less than a week. Originally when we got it I thought it was a little noisy but since its in our bathroom (across the hall from our bedroom) you can't really hear it too much. If you were planning on using it for your bedroom I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind the noise. I also wasn't sure if using it after a few months, it wasn't as effective. I thought originally when I got it, the water compartment filled up pretty fast. It doesn't do it as fast now and I wasn't sure if it was because I've been using it for a while. I try to dust it pretty often incase dust gets stuck in the machine. Overall, I still think its worth getting."
2,"works,but does not last","This produce really does work fantastic,the only down fall is that the motor for the fan does not last more then a month or so.Starts to get noisy ,then fails shortly after that."
4,Good product,"I have been using this on my boat over the last few weeks. During the winter it is damp and cold. I also leave a radiant heater running to keep the temperature above 55. The EDV-1100 does well. It seems to gather 2-3 ounces of water every day. If I was able to keep the boat warmer it would likely do better. From advice on a boaters forum someone suggested removing the top fan exhaust grill. It seems to have higher wind throughput by doing this. The power adapter only gets mildly warm, no issue here at all. I would really like to buy the EDV-2200 but there are bad reviews on it due to the hot power supply. I ""might"" just buy another one of these for the boat. We only use this while the boat is docked, not underway."
5,Great for Damp bedrooms,"I purchased this dehumidifier based on other ratings and found it to be exactly as described. This is very petite which is a nice way of saying small but it really does the job! My son's room (size 11x12) has two windows that get a lot of condensation and it always felt damp. We used the Eva-dry and within a couple of days the room felt better, my son's cough went away and the motor is quiet enough that now he uses it for white noise to help him fall asleep."
2,"Works Great, BUT ONLY FOR 12 MONTHS!","I purchased this unit to keep a walk-in closet dry. It work's great despite it's size and it's very quiet. Problem is, it only did so for a year.Upon cheking the manual it said that if the unit fails I should check the ac/dc power adapter (as if this problem was something to be expected) I checked it and yes, it's not working.I went to the manufacturer's web site but it offered no info about repairs and no way to purchase the mentioned cable.The unit has a 12 month warranty but YOU HAVE TO REGISTER WITHIN 10 DAYS of buying it or it's not valid!So be advised: it works well but for a limited time. If you buy it, register!LM"
1,Almost Worthless,"The humidifier works very slowly, taking about a week to fill a two cup resevoir. Even in a small closet, that is not enough to make much difference."
1,Breaks down easily,"Dehumidifier works well... when it works. First one lasted 13 months, second one lasted 13 days. I would not think of buying a third one. Amazon customer service - 5 stars, easy and simple procedure to return."
3,Decent little unit for the money,"It worked really well taking humidity out of a damp bedroom for a couple years, then it died.It is however a really good price for a small dehumidifier."
1,Defective,"When I plugged it in, the ""full"" light would not turn off -- so the dehumidifier would not turn on. There was no Customer Service number in the box, so I had to look it up on Eva Dry's website. When I called the number (not toll-free), the Customer Service person said the sensor was defective and I could mail the dehumidifier to Florida for repair. No thanks! I'm returning it and trying a different brand."
1,It worked then broke,I bought it for my daughter who started using it and today she told me it stopped working. Please let me know how to handle getting a new one.
3,"Works great, but limited lifespan.","We've had two of these. The first died after a month, but Amazon replaced it with no problems.The second lasted just over a year and worked beautifully the whole time. There is no easy way to clean this unit. It gets rather dusty over time and I suspect this might be what contributes to its eventual death. We had it on all the time in a small bathroom. I just wish it would last longer!"
4,happy,"This device really works good. It's very small, but it works good. I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others who are looking for a small but powerful dehumidifier."
5,Too quiet...,"Truthfully, when I plugged this in and didn't hear anything, I figured it couldn't possible work. The sound of a motor is non-existant! And it just sucks the moisture out of the air in the bathroom in a few minutes. I love it, would recommend it, and wondered why I put up with the dampness for so long."
4,Great Product with Some Modifications,"I won't go into detail about how this product works, but if you don't like the fan noise, you can easily fit a much better, quieter fan in it and make it nearly silently. I put in a Noctua NF-R8 80mm fan and you literally cannot hear it! Warning, the Noctua fan does not include the right adapter so you'll have to solder the proper one on. You'll also obviously void your warranty."
1,Absolute Garbage,"Very poor efficiency when it was working. This is partly because the front vents don't allow much airflow, and partly because they are very hard to clean and become clogged with dust quickly. But, the efficiency concerns aren't the main problem ... it's just that the unit's power supply burns out quickly and you're left with a useless piece of scrap. The non-standard plug means you can't easily swap out with another power supply. And, the company claims that it won't honor its warranty unless you ""register"" with them within 30 days of purchase."
1,Eva-dry Electric Petite Dehumidifier,I was very displeased with the product. It never made a difference in a very small room. It stopped working within 5 weeks. Waste of money.
1,Worked great for 10 months,"What can I say...I bought this for my bathroom which is lacking a ventilation fan and has tremendous moisture issues. I left the unit on 24/7 and it worked very well, with the water basin needing to be emptied every 2-3 days. Unfortunately, after 10 months, the unit started just making a buzzing sound and the fan wouldn't work. I tried to open it up and replace the fan, but it turns out the circuit board is cooked. Since I opened up the unit, I voided the warranty and the company won't honor it. What can I say...$50 is a lot of money for 10 months of use."
2,I don't think it does anything...,"I've had this thing in my approx. 10x10' room for a week now running constantly, and there's still no water accumulated in the catch pan... And it's not for lack of humidity. I'm deployed, and my room is definitely humid! I'm not sure why, but I just don't think it's doing anything.. Bummer."
2,EXCELLENT CONCEPT BAD PRODUCT,THE FIRST 2 FILL UPS WHERE VERY QUIET AFTER THAT STILL WORKS BUT VERY NOISEY
1,Didn't work,"This product did not work AT ALL. It didn't take one drop of moisture out of the air. I tried it in one small, damp closet, and in a damp laundry room. This dehumidifier didn't work in either area. I returned it."
1,Rather too small,"I'm not sure what this dehumidifier is precisely for, other than perhaps a cupboard or closet. It's far too small to produce any noticeable change in air humidity in even a small room. I at times have water running down the windows of my apartment due to humidity problems; I ran this unit for 2 hours and there was still not one drop of water in the reservoir. It is also not ""whisper quiet"" but sounds like a small fan one might use for cooling."
1,not even a teaspoon,"I purchased this item to use in my bathroom. While taking a showing i turned the unit on and let it run for an hour after i finished my shower, i checked the unit and there wasn't even a teaspoon of water. i continued to let the unit run for an additional 1 1/2 hours and still nothing. don't waste your time with this one."
4,"Good, but not quiet","I bought this a few months ago to help dry out a bedroom with a mold problem. The unit works well and seems to get a lot of water out of the air. However, please note that it is quite small and is probably only useful in a small room. My only complaint is that the specs said it was ""whisper quiet."" It is not. It's not overly loud, but it can be heard in the hallway and the noise can be a bit annoying."
4,Working great after 6 months!,I purchased two of these and they have lived up to my expectation over the first 6 months. I haven't had any issues with them and will update my rating/post if anything does happen. They pull a good amount of water out of the air but having two of these in my apartment still didn't remove quite as much water as one larger (30 pint) unit did in the same amount of time -- although they are much quieter.
3,works until broken,"I bought this to use in my humid deployed location. It worked really well to keep my small room dry. My towels dried out really quick and the dampness in my room diappeared. However after two months the motor went out and it broke. I was unable to register the warranty because of the firewall on base and when I got home from the deployment the warranty was bad because I did not register within 10 days. So I am just out the money. Recommend because it worked great for two months, just use caution and dont forget to register for the one year warranty."
1,Does not dehumidify bathroom during shower!!!!,"I purchased this unit in order to keep my bathroom mirror from fogging up during showers. My bathroom is very small, so I figured this would be no problem. Boy was I wrong! I used this unit for 3 days, and it only collected about 3 drops of water. And my shower steams the bathroom up like a steam sauna. How can you only get 3 tiny drops of water out??? I could run a rag over the mirror and squeeze out a solid cup. Well, anyways, for anyone trying to dehumidify the bathroom during a shower, avoid this little unit. It might work great in a low humidity area, but that after all, that seems kind of pointless."
2,For jazz-fans only,"Of course you can't blame Elis for performing jazz at a jazz-festival; and this music is probably performed very well too; but any way, I didn't enjoy this because I don't like jazz; two stars only because I want to warn everyone considering buying this cd because there's so much talk about it or because one may like Elis so much (like I do): beware; this is really jazz!"
3,"Middle of the road, dissappointing collection.","I love Poppy's writings. She could publish her grocery list and I'd buy it. Having said that, her collection from Gauntlet Press is a tad uneven. The great stories are here;Arise, Self-Made man, Saved,Pin Money and Mussolini and the Axeman's Jazz. All are great genre-breaking tales. But some of the others seem to be just ramblings, incoherent musings at best. And if someone can tell me what Peter Straub's introduction was meant to do, I'd greatly appreciate it. Caitlin Kiernan's afterword is a fun reminiscence on her first meeting Ms. Brite. Recommended for fans of Poppy Z. Brite, only."
4,Monkey Kong Monkey Kong Monkey Kong Monkey Kong,"This album brings out a lot of creativity. Songs like ""Summer on the Underground"" and ""For Staters"" really shows the potential of this English group. I did not think that they are like Offspring, like some people have said. They are even cooler than Offspring. If you are looking for some fun stuff, this is the right thing to get."
1,Truly unbearable.,"This is one of the worst CDs I've heard in a long time. I'd classify the music as emo, but I feel that'd be an insult to the emo genre (which is strange since I generally don't like emo). Musically there is nothing original on this CD. A has an amazing amount of energy for a band that's going over well tread ground. Lyrically, I find this album insulting. Not in any outraged way that I would react to someone like Eminem. Instead, I'm insulted by how little time this group seems to have spent coming up with words to their songs. Chants like ""the old folks are losers. They can't work computers!"" are part of what makes this one of the dumbest albums I've ever heard. They might be able to make up with this with the sheer energy they seem to show while playing, but there's another major drawback: the lead singer has one of the most obnoxious whiney voices that I've ever heard. All of the above combines to make listening to this album an excruciating experience."
5,Awesome value,"These work great. Fit my pontiac g6 perfectly. (2006)Also, clicked right in and installed in seconds!!amazing price 100% satisfied."
1,Does not fit 2008 Pontiac G6,"CAUTION: These wiper blades (Bosch 441) do not fit the 2008 Pontiac G6. (However, according to other reviews, it appears that they do fit model years 2005-07.)"
1,Suitably reverent but poorly done,"Mr. Bjarkman uses the title ""Dr. Baseball"" on some of his other books, but you may need a doctor to digest this lumpy, slackly written entry for fans of the Dodgers."
4,Good deal,"This really is a good deal right out of the box for everything including many games.I dropped in a 256mb Video card ($99) and 1gb extra memory ($99), came up with an excellent gamer, and was still $300 under the same configuration discounted retail out of the box!"
1,Not happ with this one,I've had this system for just over a year. It's one of the slowest computers I've ever owned. About a month ago the screen went blue. It doesn't come with a recovery disc. I would't buy it again.
2,Didn't use it.,"I bought this book to use for my Medical Transcription job, but I ended up not using it at all."
2,Disappointed in Little Tikes,"Little Tikes has always been known for their quality, but unfortunately this product leaves something to be desired. We have now returned 3 of these because of poor construction. The product does not seem to get firm enough, and on each one we have had we found a place where air was leaking out of the seams. My three year old was very disappointed because this is the only model we have found with a slide (which she loved) and we had to return it for another brand. If you can get one of these that actually works correctly I am sure it would be great fun, but I guess we just weren't that lucky (three times!)."
3,Okay C++ book,"Interesting concept of explaining C++ through the use of diagrams and pointers to code segments. Really useful I must admit despite what others say.Each area of C++ is concisely explained with examples on e next page. Great for QUICK references. HOWEVER, its filled with minor spelling errors.... this can be quite disappointing, but hey, its not that bad. What area of C++ is explained? Just the usual stuff, but nothing to do with library definitions, but more on e basic stuff like arrays, enums, OO and others.Definitely a SHORT and QUICK reference book, but for such a thin book compared to the other massive volumes of C++ programming books out there... you might want to look else where. This book is definitely for BEGINNERS ONLY. But the minor errors might cause some confusion.....so watch out."
3,Big but bendy bra,"I thought I'd try a non wired bra. Mistake! Perhaps this will work for others but not for this mammary bearing woman. It is Ok and I wear it, but it crunches up underneath (beneath the bosum, wrinkles develop. I think my size is just too big for these.). From now on I'm staying with underwire, although I am gratefull to Goddess for making bras my size. Thanks folks"
3,Review for use as Conditioning Treatment for Hair.,"A quick search on Google or Pinterest will bring up a variety of instructions for deep conditioning hair with coconut oil. Since so many bloggers were raving about it, and I'm mildly obsessed with hair conditioners, I wanted to try it.The results are in: its okay. It DID leave my hair very soft to the touch, but no shinier than other conditioners. It was also difficult to wash out.Pinterest/Google gave several instruction options. I chose to wet my hair and apply the oil, then heat through with a bonnet dryer. The oil is solid at room temperature, but melts when rubbed in the hands, so heating it is not necessary. I did not mix with anything. It has very little smell. It has a more pasty than sticky texture.Will perhaps try again, but overall prefer other actual conditioning treatments."
1,Has he ever met any witnesses?,"short and to the point:WHERE did he get the idea that MOST witnesses do NOT want to go door to door? i am grandpa to a kid who LOVES the work! my daughter of 20 - single, sweet, still a virgin - is a pioneer and goes out for LOVE of JEHOVAH, not for some guilt or whatever.He is all wet. Hence my question, which likely will remain rhetorical: has he ever MET any of Jehovah's people?"
5,gorgeous book,Lost my original hard copy and bought new hard cover book from this seller which was in perfect condition for a reasonable price.
2,Average at best,"I love Bocelli and visited Westminster recently so there should have been a great connection with this video but I found it a touch boring and uninspiring. Christmas Glory had some moments with a couple of songs but overall the video was disappointing. If you are in search of Bocelli selections, there are far better choices - Sacred Arias for one."
3,Christmas Music and Poetry,"Charlotte Church in my mind is one of the most beautiful spirits alive on the earth today. She has an almost angelic quality about her that always makes me wonder if God stops everything he is doing to listen to her sing. When she sings ""The Holy City"" it gives me shivers just from the pure beauty of her voice.When I listen to Andrea Bocelli, I always close my eyes because there is something spiritual about his voice. While Charlotte and Andrea do make many appearances, the choir is magnificent.One thing I noticed that amused me to no end was when Charlotte Church was singing, the choir boys stood so perfectly it was as if they were enchanted by her. In fact, anyone singing with her seemed to think they had just gone to heaven.A spiritual evening one imagines would be quite wonderful to haveexperienced at the Westminster Abbey in person.~The Rebecca Review"
2,A feeble offering from a fine writer,"I feel that Alison Leslie Gold, whose book on Anne Frank I thought very fine, was unwise to choose this topic. In approaching the relationship between Eva Braun and Adolf Hitler, her imagination seems to have recoiled. A kind of paralysis sets in immediately after the brilliantly-written description of the horribly real people who sell the author the ""Diary."" Alas, these are the last horribly real characters to appear in the novel. The unrelenting banality of the ""Diary"" entries seems to owe much to a reading of Hannah Arendt, without Arendt's originality. Alas, it not only makes dull prose -- it offers nothing new. This was an opportunity for Gold to say something about a much-neglected topic, offer some insight into a notorious but little-understood relationship, but she has largely passed up the opportunity. Seen beside any real effort, in fiction or non-fiction, to look at the nature of Hitler, I'm afraid that this book pales into insignificance."
5,Beautiful music and excellent interpretation,This french impressionist music is very beautiful.To play this music a flutist needs an excellent technique but also an excellent tone and Galway has both. There is no flutist that has a more suitable tone for this music as Galway does. This music explores a great variety of sound shades and that is what makes it so special and unique.Just listen to Debussy's L'Apres midi d'un faune and you will understand what do I mean.This music takes to a world of beautiful and fantastic sounds it is like having a dream full of music.Even if you don't like very much classical music you will enjoy it. Listen it it is like a relaxation therapy. This music really relaxes you.It is an excellent purchase.
4,WOW!,"This book really helps you understand how what starts off as an innocent friendship can get out of control and cross the line...We have to be careful what we share with others,especially thiose of the opposite sex...."
5,The Must Read for understanding and recovering,"This is a life changing book. For everyone reading reviews I would put this book at #1. It is up to date and will help make this awful stuff understandable and more important give you some ideas on what to do next. Its mostly for the victim of an affair be it emotional or sexual or both. For the person who had the affair chapter 8 is a must read. If you have no interest in reconciling, this book would not be the best."
5,Great buy!,"Unfortunately, I have to say this book amazingly accurate, I'd compare it to my journal if ever I had written one. Sometimes its funny, sometimes its nice to know Im not the only one, and sometimes I feel as if Dr. Glass were spying on me, too close for comfort. Its definitely a book I'd recommend whether you've had relationship problems or not, its a book everyone needs to read."
1,This book is a joke,"If this book is such an ""authoritative tome"" on the subject, then how come none of the multiple couples counselors and therapists I've talked to have ever heard of or read the book?The premise that only the ""involved"" spouse had anything to do with the affair is a complete and utter fallacy - and anyone who's been cheated on and wants to believe that is just fooling themselves. This book panders to the spouse who was cheated on and I personally fail to see how that attitude provides anything constructive to a relationship that's going through the rebuilding/healing process. There are no easy answers to anything in life, sorry."
4,Kind of a hard read,"I think this book is very helpful,just a lot of info to take in at once. She bounces from one couple to another so it's hard to keep up with. I am trying to just take pieces of it that fit my situation. Not a book to be read quickly."
2,"Good, but...","I love silent film, and obviously the author does too. But I feel like she has way too many ""most,"" ""first,"" ""only.""and ""best"" designations. And who she decides to write about is so all over the place. Some left out that I feel shouldn't have been. Some included that were ho-hum. But the writing is lovely."
3,Mostly pepper flavor,"It's flavor is okay, I was hoping for more of a spicy cardamon and clove flavor."
2,Los Ricos tan bien lloran,The dvds looks a cheap product and i hate the kind of dvds come in double layers.
5,Los Ricos Tambian Lloran,"I wanted this novela as a child and I was fascinated by it. Having in DVD helps relive those moments. The quality and story is fascinating. This is how the classical novelas were made. They no longer make this kind of novelas and it is sad. In this novela there is drugs, violence, and unappropriate language. The story still warms my heart."
3,"old stuff, good enough also today","I was hoping in something more significant; anyway, it is not a bad book."
4,pretty good!,"this is a good inspirational book to give to a loved one. i plan on getting it for my sister. her cat died and i lit a candle for his soul- it was the same candle i lit when my daughter died. i think she was touched by that- if you love candles or feel particularly close to the idea that lighting a candle is a spiritual activity you may gleen a lot from this book- it is relatively tiny and portable, a great book for your purse. also a cute gift. A+."
4,Really does help,"Every time a doctor would mention Kegel exercises to me I wanted to scream. It's not that they're difficult, but how do you know you're making any progress and, honestly, it's something that is easy to forget.But this little gadget has really helped me a lot. I started out using it 6-7 times a week and now I use it 3. I'm in my 50s and no children, but I started having problems with leaking in my 40s. Nothing seemed to help me until I tried ""Myself.""The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it can be a bit difficult to figure out. But read and follow the instruction carefully and within a month you will definitely see a difference. Having electronic feedback is what helped me stick with it."
4,Track listing,"This is the nearest match to what I have in my hands right now. I have a different cover - the one with her sitting and wearing an orange shirt - but it is a ""Silent All These Years"" import from Germany. The song I have are1) Silent all these Years2) Upside Down3) Me and a Gun4) Thoughts"
4,work socks,These are nice work socks for colder climates. They work well for me. I finally got the right size after I mailed back the wrong size that was sent. When I mailed back the wrong size socks they some how got lost in the mail. I was out my 20 bucks. O well I guess that's what you get when you order on line. Other wise I love the socks!
2,Poorly made,"I thought I'd try these since I loved the Wigwam Comfort Hiker socks so much, but these socks are a major disappointment. They're way too thin, but even worse, they have a terrible, squared-off toe. So you can feel this hard nub in the corners of your shoes."
2,No Thanks !!,"A very difficult read. Normally I have difficulty in putting a book down but with this one the difficulty was picking it up. The lack of punctuation was very off putting. I sometimes had to read passages over and over before understanding who was speaking to whom and then the Spanish would start and I'd be lost again.However, there were a few touching passages and the ending ALMOST brought a tear to my eye. But overall it was rather disappointing. The sentences were too long, the descriptions a bit too descriptive (to the point you forgot what he was describing) and the Spanish just too annoying.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,i am dyyyyyyyyyyyyiiiingggggggggg,"I am listening to the cd version of the book. This narrator is killing me!!! I am so bored and annoyed.I have blanked out over 100 times and the reader's voice is horrible, he's so breathy and boring. I am trying to finish this book but I dunno..."
2,Review (overheard) on the Plains of New Mexico,"Cowboy 1: Hey, Bud, did you read that new book by Cormac? Cowboy 2: I might of looked at it. 1: Care to opine? 2: Well, I've read better. 1: You can say that again. 2: John Grady deserved better'n that. 1: I don't know if him or the dog was better off. 2: And how bout that epilogue! 1: I know, what you're sayin', Bud. I mean I gotta blow my nose in the morning, but I don't share it with strangers I meet. 2: I guess ol Cormac thought predictable and windblown was the way to go on that one."
4,wonderful reading but terribly abridged,"This is a wonderful reading of the closing ""chapter"" of Cormac McCarthy's Border trilogy, but it's terribly abridged. A pity--it's one of the best things Brad Pitt has ever done. McCarthy has really stumbled upon a most engaging formula: Aeschylus meets Louis L'Amour."
4,an allegorical depiction of the American mythos' end,"Macarthy's final book of the Border Trilogy is indeed, a depiction of the final chapter of the great American mythic hero, the cowboy. Eminent domain, the love of horses, a beautiful Mexican prostitute, authentic dialogue, the sad old rancher...they're all here, along with Macarthy's other, omniscient character, the landscape. Maybe a brush a little too broad this time, but he's definitely got the dialogue down."
4,Henckels makes beautiful scissors,"I needed a small pair of scissors to use when doing mending (yes, I'm old enough to know how to darn). I already own Henckels' kitchen shears, so I knew that these would be good quality. At $8.99, with the super saver and 4 for 3 options, these are good value as well. The reason they only get four stars is because they do not come with any kind of case or protector for the tip. These scissors, as all Henckels scissors, are extremely sharp; for this reason they should be in some kind of case, even in a sewing basket, so that they can't accidentally cut you."
3,These were just what I needed...for awhile.,"I was looking for a spice rack that would fit inside my pantry door. These actually fit the bill VERY nicely. They have a slide to adjust them, the accommodate many sizes, and they looked nice and orderly when they were installed. They are basically peel and stick, and it's pretty strong adhesive if you are not going to put them in a place where they will be jiggled a lot. They stood up for 6 months before beginning to fall off the door and into the floor. At first I was sticking them back up there; then the tape started tearing. I'm sure they will still be fine if I want to superglue them to the door. I don't. I will edit if I find an alternate solution. With a more reliable way to mount them, they would be fantastic, especially for the price."
3,Enjoyable but not exceptional,"Some reviews have compared this book to Girl with a Pearl Earring or The Virgin Blue. I liked Chevalier's stories much better...richer characters, deeper storyline. I read this entire book and mostly enjoyed it. I was never tempted to give up on it. But, on the other hand, I was not moved by it. The characters were hard to relate to....vapid, hysterical, social climbing, shallow, etc. Those are the words that come to mind. The character of the lame Aunt Julie was my favorite. She seemed genuine and strong. If you read this book, you'll probably like it but if you don't read it you haven't missed reading a GREAT book."
5,An engrossing read!,"I read this book with very few pauses. I have been interested in the art piece 'Madame X' but the book made it come alive. Of course, it is fiction, but I want it to be real. I know that the story is based on facts and bits and pieces of documentation that are available to the author, but the story that she has woven around this tangible evidence is so otherworldly that I was lost for a full two days as I read. I was wishing to be Madame X and wanting for the tale to be true and yet not at the same time due to the tragic romanticism. It was truly a great read."
5,Why I loved Bye Bye Birdie,"My favorite kinds of music are those that you can remember and sing word-for-word when you hear the 3 opening notes. Bye Bye Birdie is one of those musicals. The chorus of guys and girls is great, and Jason Alexander's voice in ""Rosie"" is amazing. The support vocalists are astounding, and this music isn't some you'll soon forget."
2,WHERE IS DICK VAN DYKE & CHITA RIVERA?,"Bye Bye Birdie is not Bye Bye Birdie without Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera. This TV production was like a high school production. Jason Alexander can't sing, can't dance and his hair piece kept falling all over the place. Conrad looked like an old man, and Venassa Williams, though she sings pleasantly, was ok. The girl who played Kim was terrible. Though this TV production followed the original broadway show and had all the songs from the origianl show, plus they added 2 songs which didn't measure up the to rest of the score, the singing is bland and poor in some cases. As for the movie cd. Though not as good as the original broadway cast album because they dropped some of the good songs, it did have a lot of spirit, and who doesn't love Ann Marget. Music wise, talent wise, you can't beat the original cast album and the cd is just grand. I never get tired of listening to it."
1,SWITCH & BAIT,SWITCH & BAIT ******** BEWARE ************Ordered a Victorinox and was shipped a generic no name brand made in Germany.Ordered the Swiss made Victornox to replace my other Victorinox that was 30 years old.Was not shipped what was advertised - typical SWITCH & BAIT
4,"A good recording, but not for me","I tried hard to like this recording, yet I was bored. This is not the performers' fault, all of whom do a marvelous job. Rather, my dissatisfaction with the recording comes from my confusion about how the music of Rossini's early period should be performed. This music falls somewhere between a baroque opera seria and a bel canto opera, and I just can't decide whether one should sing it the way one would sing Vivaldi or the way one would sing Verdi. While I was trying to do justice to Kasarova I was simultaneously wishing for a counter-tenor to sing her role. While thinking of what the performance might have been I ruined my enjoyment of the performance that was."
5,Makes great Chi Tea,Boil 14 oz of water and 2 bags for about 3 mins. Add sugar (I use 1 Stevia) and some whipped cream (not a lot of calories so use the real stuff) to a cup and pour team over it. YUMMMMMMM
4,Forkchops,"This set was purchased as a gift for persons who love asian food and prepare many dishes from Thailand, China and India. It was well received."
4,Is it necessary?,"The book is not bad, but I wonder why the authors had to publish a separate text, instead of incorporating it into their other one (""Engineering Electromagnetics""). There is a lot of overlap between Chapter 8 of Engineering Electromagnetics and Chapters 2 and 3 in Electromagnetic Waves."
2,Not as good as other Stephen Shwartz music!,"I had expected music like the fantastic musicals Godspell or Pippen that Schwartz wrote. This album is a much more contemporary and boring Schwartz. I must admit I was VERY dissapointed. However, if you like soft rock, you may enjoy it."
3,Spirit Of John Morgan - 'Age Machine' (Repertoire),"Originally released in 1970, as this is the British psych band's second of just two records. Personally, I liked their first self-titled effort Spirit Of John Morgan a little more (see my review). Tunes here that I found myself hitting the replay button [a few times] were the title track ""Age Machine"" [reminds me of Zeppelin's ""Boogie With Stu""], ""Friend Of Jesus"", their stab at progressive ""Seventh Dawn"" and the catchy ""Mumbo Jumbo"". Read somewhere that John Morgan (the band's key player has performed with James Brown for many years). Overall, this CD reissue isn't a bad find."
4,Works fine,"I'm happy with the Internet Phone Wizard. I bought it so I could use a good cordless phone with it and not be stuck to the computer and it does that. One of the reasons I didn't give 5 stars is that you can't actually dial a number into the phone, which I knew before buying, but still that tethers you back to the computer when you don't have a speed dial programmed in. Another reason is that sometimes the caller id on the phone doesn't show the current caller but the caller before. The last reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that sometimes after a call has ended, it will start ringing the phone for about a minute. These last two things are intermittent and really don't bother me. The first thing, as I said, I knew before buying so, on the whole, it works fine."
1,Very poor quality and no support,I bought the first device and while I could hear fine the person on the other end heard either a really bad echo or words were being dropped. I sent it back and tried another one with the exact same results. Contacted their tech support online and never received an answer. I tried both devices on three different computers with the same result. I can use a headset connected to the sound card with excellent phone quality so it is not the network connection. I would not recommend this device.
4,Wow I . Love this book....,At first I couldn't get into this book but once I did I would wake up at all hours to read some more.. it's a great love story.
3,A Soft Place to Fall (Shelter Rock Cove),I have enjoyed books I have read by Barbara Bretton. This one was good but it dragged in places for me.
4,Nice Comparison of Two Formidable Military Figures,"This is definitely not for the general reader. More time could have been given to the Waterloo campaign but all in all a good account of the two men and the mutual respect that had to have for one another. I enjoyed the numerous meaderings he took on all aspects of these two personalities and their lives before and after Waterloo.He shows though how both were so concerned about their place in history. Although Welington won the battle, wanting no one to forget that, he seemed to lose the war as Napoleon was very successful in propagating the Napoleonic Legend. Most enjoyable for any enthusiast of this period."
5,Stories of Saints of Italy,"These are a series of beautiful stories of saints of Italy including Saint Antony of the Desert, St. Martin the Bishop, St. Nicholas, St. Benedict, and more. Many details I had never heard before are included herein."
5,Karen McDougal is a Goddess,"Any video featuring the lovely, seductive, and enchanting Karen McDougal is a video worth owning. Whether you are a die-hard fan of Playboy videos, or simply in awe of the spectacle that is Ms. McDougal, this video is a must have."
4,Overall a very pleasing video,"Karen McDougal really makes this video. Her natural earthy charm and uncommon good looks make this video stand out. There is also a nice variety of sets. I wanted to give this video a 5 but Karen's breasts appear fake and detract from her otherwise outstanding appearence. Nevertheless, you won't be disappointed with this video."
2,"Karen's beautiful, so why not show her off?","A gorgeous Playmate with 'home-town' appeal and a mega-watt smile. Karen sizzles in a slow striptease by an apartment door. But be warned. The video is heavy on the rock-video kitsch; those slick, MTV-style edits that work well for music videos, but are just plain irritating in a Playboy production. Unless you're a diehard Karen McDougal fan, I'd say skip it."
2,Total pain,"The game itself is okay as far as the questions and stuff, but theres something wrong mechanically with the buzzers......and you get something wrong if you don't spell it almost exactly. Oh, and Trebec is soooooo annoying!"
5,Eye of the Storm: A Civil War Odyssey,"I just received the book ""Eye of the Storm"": A Civil War Odyssey. The book is in perfect condition from the Atlanta Book Company. Terrific service, thank you.Mike"
4,HAIL TO THE CHIEF,"good movie about Lincolns last days, watched with my 11 yr old son ,my favorite part when he entered Fords and the play comes to a halt and they strike up hail to the chief ,very moving."
5,Stovetop Barbeque,Almost like using a barbeque without having to go outside. Nice grill marks and fat drips into groves providing a great appearance to your indoor fte champtre.
3,Too hard to wash,"I thought this would be a great pan to cook meat on and it is. But trying to wash the pan and get into the grooves adequately was just too much trouble. I gave the pan away to a friend than has more patience. It was a very heavy duty pan and well made. Nice and heavy and it heated evenly. Not sure if the ""pre-seasoned"" coating helped much as meat always seemed to stick while the juices ran to the bottom as it was designed to do. Maybe I'm just to impatient too use this type of pan which required a lot of elbow grease to clean."
2,Okay,It is a little cumbersome - more of a reference rather than a enjoyable learning book. Probably would not purchase it if I had it to do over again....
4,For older kids,My husband is fluent in Italian and my son is starting to say a lot of Italian words. We got this to help him learn more words. There are A LOT of words! It's not very engaging for a toddler because there are so many words on a page. This will be a great book for when he is older.
5,Evanovich is great.,"I love all of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books. Having them on cd just makes it easier to ""read."" I highly recommend them to everyone."
3,Large Print book,"The book was fine to read, great author. The cover was bad, torn and bent, but that of course does not take away from the contents."
1,Very disappionted,"I ordered a book that was supposed to be in good condition. I was very disappointed when it arrived. It was soiled, some of the pages stuck together, the spine broken and pages loose. It even smelled bad. I sent it back within a week in April. I hadn't heard from them by the middle of June so emailed them and they finally credited my account. Bad experience all around."
3,OK,"I am not a fan of Suze Orman, but I bought this book for a person who did not know much about budget management and financial discipline, and for that purpose the book is OK."
1,Don't Bother - Waste of Money,"I read this book hoping to learn something new and of value. Instead I learned how television celebrities are all hype and no substance. Nothing she says in her writing was useful to me. Everything she offers is well-known common sense financial advice available for free from almost any financial website.If you want some good sound financial advice, here's some:DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!"
1,Biased and not always correct,"Orman writes with an obvious bias. Though I agree with much of the obvious; it serves to cloud the not entirely correct. I would suggest Arthur Levitt's, Take on the Street or other such, more knowledgeably written books."
5,Suze Orman,"This is a fun book to read, with alot of 'makes sense' applications for the everyday person. And the price couldn't have been better, great condition and delivered quickly. Will buy from this seller again!"
3,its ok,"was suprized,there is not much of a mango taste to it,also my children love these types of fruit flavored snacks,,but these are a little to hard to give smaller children.but all in all they are ok."
1,Useful Information,"This product site does not list the years for which the code reader is intended(1984-1995) nor could I find a link with said info. As the owner of a '98 Chevy, this info would have been helpful. Now I am stuck with a product for which I have no use. I can only speculate as to weather or not this oversite is intentional. I will not be purchasing any more products from this site in the future. Caveat emptor."
1,even the action was not redeeming for this hunk a junk,"stratham is going to have to have a talk with his agent about this one. bad writing, unexciting fight scenes, characters that you just don't care about, no conflict, etc. if you're in the mood for a stratham flick, this ain't the one."
5,great movie,so much fun jason statham always plays a great action roll keeps you on the the edge of your seat
3,Blitz,"This was a little hard to get into because of the British language. They use so many different words than we do that sometimes you don't understand what is going on in this movie. Jason Statham as always is good in the action department but he talks so low some times you don't know what he is doing. All in all this is a very nice movie with action. I can't say I truly love it, but maybe if I watch it a couple more times I will get to understand it better."
4,Hard but needs a chance.,Scott. Don't blame yourself. This type of stuff is hard to listen to on record.I guarantee you though if you've ever seen the Art Ensemble live you'd be a fan. Fabulous show every time.
1,Low-quality,"Disappointed by the low quality of the kit. The soldering tip is made of extremely maleable copper, became blunt after first use. The pump has no suction whatsoever - the piston is only half as wide as the plastic that surrounds it. I'd return it if I could."
1,Spend your money on something else...,Terrible and worthless...spend your money on a soldering iron that will actually work.This soldering iron will barely get hot enough to do tinning and that's about it. I gave it a try and after the miserable results using it I promptly threw it in the garbage and spent money on one that actually works.
4,25Watts just doesn't pack the right punch!,"Overall I'm pretty satisfied with this kit. It does contain just about everything you need to get started soldering right away. My only complaint and the reason I didn't ratr this five stars is because the soldering iron is underpowered. I did read a few reviews were people had mentioned this fact. But it seems not everybody gets the same type of soldering iron, as most reviews claim that it worked just fine. I was one of the unfortunate ones who received the 25 Watt iron. I do not believe that I would recommend this kit to a friend."
3,"Misleading title, Electrical Reference Handbook for Audio","What's interesting about this book is that it covers aspects related to audio installations that is not normally covered in audio related books.It deals practical installation issues such as AC power (e.g. regulation), grounding, earthing, interconnection, connectors, cable, wire termination and racking.It is really a reference book for installers, not a book that you would read from start to finish.The information is a bit obscure so the book is not all that useful for those without a strong engineering background."
1,Crashed after 10 months,"The funtionaility on the screen on my iPaq deteriorated over the last month until it would not work at all. A ""clean reset"" as directed by the customer service representative confirmed what I already knew...the unit is no longer working properly. My advice is when you start having trouble with realigning the screen (which I did many times before the final crash of the screen) you call HP to see what can be done. I've abandoned by iPAQ for another option. It was an expensive experiment in having a cell phone and PDA that I won't repeat any time soon."
1,Good while it lasts,"These headphones broke after about 3 months of use. The wires got tugged on JUST a little...and snap...the headphones became inoperable.On the sound side, they were decent, although I would have preffered more bass amplification. If you haven't had the luxury of listening through high end headphones, you will not notice any difference. The earpieces were also movable, making it a snug fit for people like me, who wear eye-glasses."
4,Continuing the Adolf epic,"This is an excellent follow-up to ADOLF: A TALE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. If you enjoyed the first book, this is a superb addition.The artwork is fantastic, and the story is great. Adolf Hitler's characterization is realistic and funny at the same time.The only drawback is that not all of the three Adolfs featured in the first book are in this addition. However, that doesn't detract from the ongoing story."
2,"Provincial goes to Hollywood,","A fresh alumnus arrives to conquer Hollywood-and does it!More hints on sex than actually shown while more boy-talks than character's interest in females but pleasing an influential one on her command, made this story a bit more realistic, probably.Beautiful actors add some visual pleasure to this fairytale-family-viewing to inspire school graduates."
1,WORSE MOVIE EVER!,"Granted I only bought this movie because I was a background actress in it and although it was a kick to see me several times throughout the film, this movie was boring, not funny and a waste of time. The directing sucked, the cinematography sucked, the screenplay sucked - it all sucked!"
1,Some urban legends do change!,"I was a Sergeant in the Corps attached to Marine Aviation Logisitics Squadron 16 (MALS-16) during Desert Shield/Storm when I heard story of the personal sex tape from the wife of a Marine. I was in Al Jubal when I heard the story of the Marine's wife sending him a recorded Rambo vhs tape. When he was watching the movie along with other Marines, the tape switch to a man and a woman having sex. The woman had a mask on which she then took off to reveal being the Marine's wife. She stated that this is what he gets for cheating on her many times. The story goes further, supposedly after he watch the tape, he shot himself in the head with his M-16 rifle when he went back to his tent. Now when I was told this story, supposedly it happen within that same day. But the part of him shooting himself the same day I heard it 6 months later. Hey, Swofford, when did the story reach you? You, sir, are a SH*T BIRD!"
1,Swofford is a DIRTBAG!!!!,"Tony Swofford spends most of the book discussing his emotional problems growing up as an Air Force brat and then details the chicanery he pulled in an attempt to get kicked out of the Marines. While he's ""pouring out his heart,"" he continually jumps back and forth to his Gulf deployment (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm). Very poorly written.Overall I found this book to be 257 pages of pure and unadulterated CRAP about a self-centered jerk. It is not worthy enough to be compared with other USMC books such as, ""A Rumor of War,"" ""With the Old Breed,"" ""One Tough Marine,"" or ""Marine!"" just as Mr. Swofford isn't worthy enough to call himself a Marine.This is the first book for which I ADAMANTLY AND VOCIFEROUSLY DEMAND A REFUND. NOT WORTHY OF ANY STARS."
1,Pretentious and juvenile,"I bought this book and was hooked in the first page. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. You never get to the fighting, since he didn't do any. He trained to be a killer and never took a shot; just wept over dead Iraqis. This guy probably took a lot of heat from real Marines, since they don't tolerate whiners who think the're better than their rank. And he didn't measure up to his. (Oh, my -- are you and your broken, drunken buddies going to look me up and beat on me for ""a day or an hour or a lifetime."") This guy is a disappointment to the Iowa Writers program as well as to the Marine Corps."
1,If this book is true then why isn't the author in prison?,"Most of what the author describes in this book should have gotten him courtmartialed and thrown in a military prison. Even if you want to be charitable about it, at the least he should have gotten a dishonorable discharge."
1,Don't Buy,"This book is an offensive, vile and absurb rendition of the enlisted men of the USMC. Threw it in the trashcan after reading as it is not worth placing in anyone's bookshelf."
2,Not at all a good book,"Swofford is a braggart, a probable liar, and as such is an example of all that is wrong with American military culture.His platoon seems to be populated by overgrown, scatological fifth graders, hopped up on whatever hootch they can ingest and hyperdeluded by an aggregate of Hollywood war movies, from which they get their twisted self-images.If this is the message Swofford is attempting to send, then he's done an adequate job. Unfortunately, he is a terrible prose stylist who prefers to tell rather than show, and whose strange compulsion to list things is to say the least annoying."
4,"Well, it's a Hell of a story, anyway.","Hmm, I read this book and was extremely impressed- make no mistake, the author is a whipsong writer. I thought i had ingested the true gritty tale of some extremely crazy stuff, and was repeatedly reminded of why i would tend to run a mile not to join any military organisation going. Then I read the reviews posted here by other Marines and everything went a little ""Rashomon""- who's accounts do I trust? Who is telling the truth? Perhaps they are all telling their personal truths, perhaps they are all covering up, obfuscating, or distorting their credentials. Maybe none of them are Marines at all. But as far as the book itself goes, even if it is complete fiction, it is still beautiful. Not pretty, but beautiful. And, like I said, a HELL of a story."
5,Killing the Messenger...,"I really enjoyed this book and respect the author. In the first chapter Swofford clarifies that he wrote ""what I know"", and there is a bibliography of books consulted for facts pertaining to Gulf War combat and Middle Eastern topography. That being said, he honestly and deftly narrates his education about life, warfare and manhood from his formative years as a ""military brat"" and then as a Marine Corps sniper deployed to the Gulf War. The book alternates between flashbacks, interspersed, tangentally connected incidents (like a friend's death) and the particularities of U.S. military history, artillery and service. There is a wealth of human grist in this memoir to consume for an intelligent reader. The fact that he shared his front-line account of a war should be applauded. The straightforwardness of Mr. Swofford is a trait I wish I saw more of in our world."
2,A counseling session put down on paper.,"I must agree with earlier reviews that this book is of minimal impact. Although some of the events and feelings portrayed are candid and dead on, the book as a whole is still lacking, and reads like something you'd hear at group counseling.The author seems to want to make the reader feel some sort of empathy with him, and his particular situation, as he sees it. I am sure this book will create all sort of empathy, hand wringing, and literay buzz among those who have a particular view of war, the military, or current national policy. But for those, like me, who have been there, seen that, and have the t-shirt it all just sounds like whining.Either anti-war or pro-war, I was hoping for something a little more solid.Sorry, I can't recomend this book."
2,horse shoes and handgrenades,Close but not quite. Anthony Swafford does in fact capture some aspects of what its like being a Marine. I found his description of his combat experience close. However; his self described antics prior to the actual events and descriptions of boot camp were extremely exagerated. I too am a Marine. I too went to the same boot camp and was even a Drill Instructor at one point. I too went to the Gulf war. But for the life of me I dont remember seeing any Marines behaving like that either at Camp Pendleton or in Saudi or Kuwait. Of course it is possible he and his platoon were the only ones who did anything there. Please spare me. I found it an entertaining read if nothing else. But to describe the book as anything but one persons view through a straw. Of events and experiences in the Marines during that period of time as anything else but BS is exageration.
5,One of the best books written on Desert Storm,"I have read many books on many of the battles the US has been involved in and Tony's ""Jarhead"" may very well be the best. He told a hard to tell story of Marine who questioned his choices and his service. This book is very well written and is much more interesting to read than many of the books put out by journalists, Generals and Admirals.Tony should be very proud of his service to his country and of this excellent book."
4,Interesting but depressing,"I served in the Corps at the same time as Mr Swofford, so many of the places and some of the names are familiar. Also familir are some of the feelings, and he does a good job at articulating them. While my tour in the USMC (and life in general, apparently) was not nearly as depressingly hellish as his was, it struck a bone or two. I caught myself feeling rather torn while reading this book - on one hand a little angry at him for painting such a broadly negative picture, on the other, proud of him for having the stones to air it out.Over all, good book."
4,True to Life,Combat snipers are really like this. I knew some of these guys. They're crazy (and not in a good way) and are totally unsuited for any other kind of life once they've been trained. They are extremely good at what they do and extremely dangerous to humanity. Swofford shows the Gulf War for what it was and the marines for what they are and grips the reader in a frenzy of activity making the whole thing seem like a slowly approaching train wreck. A very good train wreck.
5,Excellent example of a Marine's experience,"Having also served during that period in 1/8 STA, I can personally tell you that this book moved me from page one. Reading this book not only brings back memories of my unit but also reminds me of my own personal experiences. If Swoff hadn't written the book from his perspective, I would have thought it to be my own. From cover to cover, this book portrays all the experiences a young Marine goes through in a Victor unit. From the most fleeting thought to the greatest aspirations, Anthony Swofford has captured something intangible by most writers in this genre. This book tells a true story from a perspective unlike anything else."
1,full of lies,"as a retired marine and a desert storm vet, i found this book full of lies. no jr marine would talk to a senior officer the way he has the marines in his book. this was not so much a book about desert storm but about his feeling about the marine corps. it was wrong to make everyone feel that the book was a truthful account of the marine corps during desert storm. this book should never have been comparied to a rumor of war."
5,"""Jarhead""","Swofford's book is a metered revelation in both reality and humanity. I haven't been so affected by writing in a long, long time. I don't have to be a Marine to recognise the authenticity of feeling this man conveys. Hopefully, this book has/will stanch some of his and other veterans' internal bleeding. But mostly it should make us all think about what we do when we commit others to war. Thank you, Anthony Swofford, and keep on writing."
1,Marines?,"Where do I start? I hope the book was good, cuz the movie was atrocious. I never go to a movie wishing for it to end as much as I wanted this one to. Are marines really this bad. I cant beleive that the Staff Sergeant played by the overacting Jamie Fox can be responsible for an innoculation range in which a soldier gets a bullet thru his skull, and subsequently dies, can then go on with his career let alone serve on operations. What kind of trust would his soldiers have in him? Is this the way marines act in real life? Apparently this is a true story, god help anyone serving along side these poor excuses for soldiers."
3,Anthony Boudrain goes to Iraq,Jarhead was a good read but he is just a little to much sometimes. He gives a great depiction of what it must be like to sit in a windy sandy desert for months not knowing when the war will start. He gives you a good feel of what the average life of a Marine is. The author was a sniper during Persian Gulf War 1 and I had never read a book on the affair so I was glad I read it.But don't get to excited.
1,question of character,"I'm a former Marine (13 years) and Desert Storm veteran and this book absolutely sickens me. My military experience is something near and dear to my heart because of the many friendships I made. I'll never experience that kind of camraderie again. So, it really disgusts me to read such nonsense. In my opinion Mr. Swofford is corrupt of any morals and character. He certainly doesn't represent the Marine Corps I knew or the men and women I served with. God help you for selling your soul to make a buck. The book is pure garbage and lacks any sense of truthfulness. I just can't grasp the reason why he would do such nonsense.""Tucked away in the folds of my life are discipline and determination, a refusal to quit when the going gets rough, a love for our country's freedom, a respect for authority. Thanks Marines!"" - Chuck Swindoll"
5,Q1 6 Cell Battery,"I love my Q1, but the battery life has always been too short. The 6 cell battery fixes that problem."
4,A superb insight into the psyche of Lust Killers,"For those who have ever asked ""why?"" This book will help you discover the answers, one of the best Serial Killer books on the market and one I refer to often for research and uni study.Highly Recommended."
3,Sombody wake me up!,"As in many trilogies, book two is just filler between the beginning and the end. So is the case here. I was hoping to at least resolve the issue as to wheather the Fool is a woman, (dissapointing), or a man. As much as I like Robin Hobb's work, I found myself saying, ""just what the heck was that chapter about?"". The character plots meander all over the place, the story line seems to bog down with too many loose ends, awaiting book three. I managed to finish it, because of my devotion to Hobb, and anticipate satisfying endings to all the issues in book three. Having said that, If you like Hobb, you will find enough to make this a satisfying, if skimpy meal."
5,Great storyline,"Robin Hobb is an amazing author. This series is so far my favorite that she has written. Great story, well written."
4,Fitz stays true to himself-- frustrating and very human.,"Hobb is consistently such a good fantasy writer and this book is not an exception to that rule. It isn't her best, which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five, but I'm impressed at the number of books that she's managed to write while still keeping me enthusiastically attached to the series. I was actually pretty seriously disappointed that the final book in the trilogy won't be released in paperback for another six months.People have pointed out that this is a character development book, and that's clearly true. But there isn't anything wrong with that and endless saga writers like Rober Jordan should take a lesson about how it's done."
5,A Fantastic Guide for Vegan Cooking,"Real Food Daily is a superb all-purpose vegan cookbook. Ms. Gentry's recipes are delicious, wholesome, attractive, and inspiring.I most appreciate her enormous contribution to making vegan food choices tasty and exciting.Be assured that you will receive value many times the price of this cookbook.Some of my favorite recipes are: Hummus, Guacamole, Pico de gallo, Carrot Salsa, Cucumber Raita, Golden Gravy, Black Bean Soup, Tortilla Soup, Corn & Black Bean Salad, Southern Corn Bread, Pear & Apple Compote, Spanish Rice, Refried Beans, Cranberry Relish, and Carrot Cake.How impressive that Ms. Gentry shares her discoveries and culinary wisdom with the owners of this fantastic book. She is truly a pioneer/leader for all of us who eat a whole-foods-plant-based diet.Rebecca WolfeMonroe, NC"
3,"I came away confused, but I was drunk when I read most of it.",I wokr a lot of hours so I tend to self medicate and read books that interest me or that have a buzz going on. A buzz for my buzz so to speak. I been hearing a lot about this and it took me about over a month to finally get through. I am really into how intense Basso gets and he has some really deep comments. But I just ended up confused at the end of it all. I should read it sober but I've been on a buzz before when I've read things and I ended up being fine.
4,"QUICK, NEW YORK-STYLE ITALIAN FOR PEOPLE ON THE RUN","Chicken Cacciatore, Shrimp Scampi Gambino-style and Manicotti Marinara are just a few of the traditional Italian dishes from ""Joe Dogs"" Iannuzzi's Mafia Cookbook that will make you feel like a made man. With a collection of anecdotes of Joe Dogs' life with the mob, this book isa good read even if you don't cook. If you do, most of the dishes feature minimal preparation time and do not call for complex ingredients requiring pre-preparation. Overall, the book would compliment most cooking libraries and work especially well for the novice Italian chef"
5,delicious and entertaining,The recipes sounds just so wonderful and authentic. I bought to go with my italian baskets for Christmas. I am using the ingredients from some the recipes for the basket with a good bottle of wine and of course the wonderful story/cookbook.
5,The original Explicit Lyric CD,"I'm a huge Jesse Dayton fan and couldn't wait to get the new Banjo and Sullivan cd. The music is fabulous....at first listen to the lyrics I had to hold back some giggles and some gasps but could not get the tunes out of my mind. There are no curse words....just very explicit lyrics....most are hilarious and some are just darn good country songs. I would love to have all of the cds that Banjo and Sullivan made instead of just the hits so hopefully Rob Zombie, Jesse Dayton and Lew Temple will start working on this soon."
2,worked a little over a year and then nothing...,"While it was working, this was a good product. I liked that you could change display from glaring bright to inverse so that driving at night was not quite to hard to do. After a little over a year of being used every other day though, the component no longer recognizes that an iPod is connected. I've tried every iPod I own and nothing works. Harman/Kardon offers no individual parts for this unit on their website, so I cannot check to see if it is the cord or the unit. Was a Christmas gift from my boyfriend and I don't have the heart to tell him that it has died already. I would not purchase it again."
4,"works great, no problems","Works like a charm, every time. Takes abotu 15 seconds to heat up all the way. It's stable and heavy enough to sit by itself on my desk without moving around, and the large power switch is easy to flick off when you're holding the 2 ends you just cut."
4,Very good transfer but not up to Criterion's usual standards,"I confirm another viewer's observation of Criterion's Alexander Nevsky: The visual restoration is excellent when it is done, however Criterion seems to have NOT been THOROUGH in restoring the ENTIRE film. There are countless sequences which appear to require simple digital clean up but wasn't done. The demonstration of the restoration, though impressive is simply ignored for too many sequences. Nonetheless, it is the very best version one will ever see (so far) or own. An amazing film. The full length commentary and extras are excellent."
2,Beware,I have been Nordic walking (really hiking up and down mountains) for nearly 4 years.I used to love these poles. They are carbon and don't vibrate like aluminum poles. And they are light.However I continually have issues with the locking mechanism not locking. I have sent the poles back once. Leki has a lifetime guarantee. They sent out repaired poles.However... having the locking mechanism fail (will not lock at all) is terrible. Once I had to use the poles at their shortest size since I couldn't lock them. Another time I had to abandon the trip.I have Leki traveler poles I use when traveling by air and have had no problems with them.I have given up on these an have just ordered some SWIX fixed length carbon poles.
4,It works great when it finally works,"I networked three PCs using the Homelink Phoneline system. It took forever to get it working, because the documentation is very incomplete, but now that it's working, it's wonderful. My daughter attends an online academy and I teach online and we can both work at the same time without a problem. janet"
4,The Legend of Mackinac Island,"Folk legends are an important part of our culture. The Great Lakes region of the United States has its fair share of folklore. One story tells us that `once upon a time' there was a grand and great turtle that floated in a world made up entirely of water. The turtle was called Makinauk. One day Makinauk received word from a great spirit that he was to build a new world, a place now known as Mackinac Island. The new world would be built on his back; where the animals of the world rested when they needed to refresh themselvesThe loon attempts to bring, from the bottom of the ocean, the soil necessary to make the land. When the loon is not successful, other animals try. Who helps and who is successful is the beautiful story of dedication, commitment, friendship and loyalty.The Legend of Mackinac Island is a traditionally illustrated book that will delight children (6-10) and one that reinforces the idea of cooperation for the good of all."
2,"Five stars for the pics, -3 for the writing","'Relieved to see the Traverse City reader's comments. I thought I was alone in failing to see the supposed ""magic"" of the book's verse. And is it legal to claim a byline for a Native legend that's as old as the hills? Just wondering."
4,Good Product for the price.,"This has been a nice bed for our first grandchild. At the price paid it is a very good value. The only reason that this does not get five stars is due to construction quality. While it is not poorly constructed, I would not say that it is built to last for years - it will never be handed down to another generation. Overall, though, we have been very satisfied with it."
5,Nice Basket,"We're so glad we didn't spend tons of money on a basket; this one worked great. Our son only fit in it for four months and we used our own blankets anyway. If it was warm weather here we probably would have taken it outside and used the hood in the sun, but it was cold and the hood wasn't ever used. It's kinda flimsy, but decent...you get what you pay for."
5,Best Led Zeppelin Book In Print,"The format of this book will eventually (hopefully) put ""written as recorded"" tablature songbooks out of buisiness! It gives you the songs as they are intended to be played. Many tablature books print too many details, they even print mistakes made by the artist.Granted, this book assumes you know how to read basic notation. If you don't want to learn how to read a little music, you have no place complaining. And for players who don't read yet, this book has a section of the main riffs and solos in tablature in the back of the book. I'm not sure what else could possibly have been included, since every song from every album is all in one book.I found the print to be very, very easy to read, as opposed to most ""written as recorded"" tab books, which are next to impossible to decipher, even for advanced players.Over all, I've had alot of FUN with this book, and that's exactly what a Led Zeppelin book should be."
1,Not a Tribute,Any one who is a fan of Luther Vandross will be sorry if you purchase this CD. It's not a tribute.......it an abomination.
4,Transitional Novel,"While this novel is not as exciting as some of the others within the Deryni series, you get the feel that the stage is being set. I would have to agree with previous reviewers that it the novel sometimes does not flow as well as some of the earlier books, however that does not detract from the overall value of the book. I found that I could not put the book down and eagerily await the next book within the series."
3,Has not engaged me thus far...,"First, let me say that I am still working on this book. I have gotten maybe 100 pages or more into the story line. It has not really drawn me in as of yet. This is a bad sign. A good story usually hooks you in the the first 20 pages. curiosity will lead me to finish the book but so far little else. No characters stand out to me as of yet, the storyline isn't all that engaging, and the writing is ok but nothing electric. I assume this book will end up as mediocre as it has been so far. So not a bad book but certainly nothing as interesting as the original deryni series or the saint camber books( original series)."
3,Mediocre,"The only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2 is because Edith Layton is normally one of the most dependable and satisfying Regency authors. The plot was interesting enough, but there simply isn't any chemistry between the main characters; in fact, the villains of the piece are far more intriguing and better drawn. I found myself nodding off after the first two chapters due to lack of interest. If you are a Layton fan, save your money on this one, and reread one of her earlier books."
4,Shows real promise.,"As a longtime jazz fan, I'm pleased to see more and more jazz artists receive recording contracts. I'd never heard Jane Monheit sing when I picked up this CD, but was pleased to find that she definitely has talent.Her style is satisfying and her song choices leave little to be desired. Her voice is reminiscent of Maureen McGovern's, but of better quality. Unfortunately, she sometimes has a tendency to be nasally; this is annoying, but doesn't happen so frequently that I abandoned the CD. Monheit also sometimes sounds like a country singer, riding hard on her Rs. Nonetheless, she is mostly pleasant to listen to, and I will consider buying other Monheit CDs."
1,dismissive and oversimplistic,"This book is ruining our marriage- it's obviously been helpful to some people, perhaps their spouses would also go to counseling and perhaps their issues were not as complicated as ours. I found the book to be very condescending and dismissive- breathtaking actually in it's ignorance. It seems to be mostly about sex and blaming; not about developing the intimacy and connection necessary for a healthy sexual relationship. If you or your partner have been abused as a child -the blaming and the use of fear to motivate are likely to cause a lot of pain and escalate problems in communication."
5,Much Needed Book!,"Congratulations to Weiner-Davis for providing the best book on the market for couples where one feels strongly about needing sex and the other partner has a low sex drive. Extremely reassuring for women who have the stonger sex drive. Weiner-Davis provides the wisdom of an experience sex therapist without pages and pages of theory. Just straight talk on the realities of the disappointment, yet with options for creating a more satisfying relationship."
1,Great Resource but obsolete test database,"This book is a great reference for anyone wanting a quick and to the point learning reference guide. However, it is useless for the actual Microsoft Server test because the key focus and format of the questions in the book and the CDROM do NOT match the questions on the Microsoft exam. I failed the actual exam (miserably) after routinely scoring very high on this books assessment testing database. Do not trust the testing material in this book."
2,Rehash of Dummies 70-210,"I had great luck with the ""Dummies"" book for exam 70-210, but this was a disappointment. Coverage of DNS and DHCP was marginal and IP section ommited some important subnetting instruction, i.e. describing subnet masking. I used the Self Test Software exam simulation (which was fairly accurate) and it had ip issues in it that weren't covered in the book. The 70-210 ""Dummies"" book gave a good background which helped. I got 800 on the 210 test and 700 on the 215 with the same studying."
1,Do not like the taste. Amazon packaging is great.,"I read all the nice reviews here before i made the purchase. But it is really not my 'cup of tea'. All the nice descriptions could not help. It tastes like medicine. On top of that, of course it is not returnable.I am going to see whether my colleague would enjoy them. I am happy as long as I do not have to drink it myself."
2,"Not so sweet or tasty, in my opinion","Everyone has their own taste. I'm a huge fan of the Good Earth caffeine-free original tea, but my local stores stopped carrying it, so I tried this one from a big box store as a substitute. The price was right, but it doesn't taste sweet or spicy, compared to the Good Earth."
3,Basics,Good book but most of the time it remains pretty basic with very simple concepts. There are more pictures than actual information. Nice first book on the topic.
5,MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING 14E,"Excellent book, easy to understand, explains the concepts very well and has several exercises with solucionario that can be used as guide. In addition to very good conditions, it like new."
5,Quick Delivery,I was very satisfied with the condition and delivery of my book. I have no complaints.
3,Weak textbook. Recommend find another.,"I have to disagree with the majority of other people here. I am an MBA candidate, the MBA being my second Master's degree.I found this textbook too simplistic in the readings to make a smooth transition to problem-solving (end of chapter problems more complicated than text examples). The text helps you understand concepts, but does not prepare you well to apply skills.I am surprised at the typographical errors I discovered, considering this is a second edition and credits approximately 100 people with reviewing the book.I believe the text suffers from haphazard layout in certain passages, seemingly jumping around in an illogical sequence. Many of the pictures are unnecessary fluff. I suggest eliminate side articles. Keep the readings concise; eliminate extraneous material to conserve reading time and reduce costs. The book is overpriced."
5,Rock-n-Roll Lives!,I'm old enough to remember when this was on the top of the charts. Great music and a great vender.
1,"a brilliant example in irony, a terrible guide to math","My wife, a former dancer who is now enrolled in college as an adult, was assigned this book in her Math class.The title seemed to indicate that was the perfect text for someone who had successfully avoided math in high school, but now, many years, later was confronted with reality.But much to our surprise this book only made things worse, much worse.I'm the math geek in the family, so I could appreciate the spirit in which the book was attempted. The author does try to make things transparent by discussing the fundamental principals/logic behind topics as Pi, the seemingly magic ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.But the execution is a classic exercise in an ""expert"" talking over the head of the reader. Unwarranted assumptions abound. Multiple concepts are packed into single passages. The text must be painstakingly read and unpacked word for word.DANGER, Will Robinson, Danger!"
5,THE CHILD DEVIANT!,"This is really cool debut album by this EBM band from Los Angelas, CA., with a brutal sound. The first and the last tracks are my favorite songs on the album. If your a DJ looking to spice up your set, there are a few potential club hits just waiting to be discovered. Recommended for fans of Suicide Cammando, and Distorted Memory."
2,I missed it!,I thought I read it properly but I missed the part where it said it was not for the manual pump it has no hole at the top to connect it. So I just used the membranes. The 24mm breast shield was good for my size 36B but does not detach so it just became a good toy for my 2 year old. I imagine it would be great for the other medela pumps though because it just a replacement of the top piece.
3,functional but hard to clean,"Because these are a a single piece and the tubing between the breastshield and membrane is longer than the standard size, it's more difficult to clean it after each use. Other than that, it works fine."
4,Product as described,This product is exactly as described. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it's harder to clean than the shields that come apart as this is all one piece. Milk gets trapped if you don't immediately rinse them. Also you can't use this with a hands free bra. They work great for me as my backup set though.
5,great for mothers that pump at work,"For three months, i was using the 2-piece personal fit breast shields that came with the pump and just washed & sterilize them with the medela steam bag after every use. When I went back to work, I purchased 4 of these and my only regret is that I didnt purchase them sooner! I work 12 hr shifts and pump every 4-6hrs. I've been using them for 3 months now and it is so helpful to have spare parts when I'm on the go. They hold great suction (better than the 2-piece personal fit ones) and are easy to clean. I'm thinking of buying a few more and I would definately recommend these to anyone who pumps regularly."
4,Quality Comic Paperback,"ADOLF: A TALE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY is about three people named Adolf during WWII- the infamous dictator, a half-German half-Japanese boy, and a Jewish boy. It seems that a potentially harmful document to the Third Reich has fallen into the wrong hands.This is a historical work with fictional characters. I recommend this comic book to anyone interested in World War II, comic books, or Japanese magna.The artwork is in black-and-white, but that does not detract from this masterpiece. There is a distinct Japanese style to the artwork.This is the first book in a five part series. My only gripe is that the the most famous Adolf- Adolf Hitler- could have been featured in the book a little bit more. I am sure he will be in the other books- considering what the damaging information about him is.Like I said, if you are interested in worldly events in that time period 1930's-1940's get this- now!"
1,Let's hear it for the location scout!,"This awful adolescent drivel is saved only by Sean Connery and the breathtakingly accurate scenery. The late 50's interiors are dead on and throughout the movie, I kept wondering, how on earth did they get permission to shoot in Cuba? Of course they didn't - it was shot in Spain.Despite the interesting atmosphere and backstory, the story itself isn't cohesive and there are holes in it big enough to hold one of Batista's white baby grands.Perhaps the story would have held if the female lead had more strength. Brooke Adams portrays Alejandra Pulido with a here-again, gone-again Spanish accent and a weakness that betrays the character as written."
2,A total mess - and not always in a good way,"Richard Lester's Cuba was rushed into production with an unfinished script and more memorable for a troubled shoot that saw Sean Connery and Richard Lester at each others' throats than for anything that made it to the screen. Set in the last few days before Battista loses power, shown with such authentic period detail that no-one seems to remember it's supposed to be Christmas (the title card even gets the year wrong!), it's a plotless mosaic disinterestedly following Connery's mercenary supposedly advising the army but in fact doing nothing much in particular before falling in with old girlfriend Brooke Adams for a love story that doesn't really happen either before the revolution sort of happens because they've got to end the movie somehow. Then he goes home alone. Hector Elizondo's aide and Chris Sarandon's cheating husband are the closest the film gets to rounded characters but everyone else just phones it in."
1,"it was bad,, and not comfortable at all,","okay today i got this lube, and i am like lets give it a quick try, this thing dry so fast unbeleiveable, plus it makes ur skin so sticky, i added water worked for about 10 sec then dries again quick, so i am like lets stick with just the water lol.. but ya this product sucks, i ordered it just because it was high rated and i guess the only people who put it in high rated were the ones who owns the brand... so my $9.48 went right down to the trash..."
5,Great product,"I love this product, my significant other doesn't seem to like it that much. She says it tends to be too slippery but I just think i'm using too much. Great for back door play!!!"
3,It contains glycerine,"I was hoping this product didn't contain glycerine, but unfortunately it does. It works, but our doctor suggests using ones without glycerine."
5,Baby loves it,"My baby isn't much of a sleeper and when I need to get stuff done this video is perfect. He loves watching it. I sit him down and he just stares at all the colors and things going on. The best part is that it's not to long and better for babies not to be sitting in front on the tv for hours. It's less then 30min, I might need more time then that but it's perfect for him, he doesn't need to watch a lot of tv. Note: if you have an iphone/smart phone they have an app for babies similar to this video. Works great when out somewhere and need to calm the baby down with some distraction."
2,"it works, but....","Cheaply made. It works, sort of, but it's so lightly made that it had completely deformed after two or three minutes. Probably more Chinese junk. We're getting some use out of it, but it will only handle the very lightest edging, and even then you will have to bend it back into shape after every use. Don't push on it very hard. It's bound to fail soon. Tired of Chinese junk. We really, really are."
5,Wonderful shower experience!,"This was so easy to install, works perfectly, feels well-made, and makes for a wonderful rain shower. It is metal, not a cheap plastic like some of them, and the screws tighten nicely to put it in a locked position. I put it in our guest bathroom, but I might be taking more showers in there!"
4,Too Soft for Me,"I tried to like this showerhead, but the water pressure coming out was too soft for me. Seemed to take more time to rinse soap off. I kept it and reinstalled it for a friend and she loves it. It does take a little effort to tighten the joints to keep them in place, but overall it's a nice showerhead. Just not for me personally."
1,Worst Quality DvD I ever got from Amazon,I was astonished at how poor the sound quality was on this DVD.I have bought many DVDs and CDs from Amazon over the years and this is the only one that was so badly recorded that I felt it was unwatchableIt sounded like an amateur effort from the front row of the stalls.
3,TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY!!!!.....,"THIS DVD IS RECORDED FROM THE AUDIENCE ON A HOME VIDEO RECORDER...THE SOUND QUALITY IS REALLY TERRIBLE!!...HOWEVER THIS PROBABLY IS ONE OF THE LAST PERFORMANCES OF QUENTINS LIFE AND IS WORTH WATCHING ANYWAYS!!,IF YOU CAN TOLLERATE THE SOUND QUALITY THAT IS!!.."
3,"Not a movie, just a recap of the seasons episodes...",I bought this for my girls to watch in the car because they LOVE wubsy!! It is about 70 minutes long and just runs back to back episodes from this season. Not really a movie. It was a disappointing buy because I already own some of the season DVD's.
1,Save you money!,"I just purchased a copy of Total 3D Home Deluxe and installed it on my Compaq 5000 series, a relatively new and capable machine.However, it simply will not run in the 'planning' mode, which happens to be the part of the program that looks to be the most valuable. I read the instructions, troubleshooting tips, and even uninstalled and then reinstalled the program, but no luck.The program cover says ""Visualize Your Dreams"", and I am doing so, but unfortunately, only in my head."
1,Broderbund Home Suite Design Warning,"Reviewing Total 3D Home Suite which seems to bundle most everything they offer. Very frustrating, counter-intuitive, difficult to work with, no tutorial, help not very helpful. Unless you are experiences with their products and have figured out some magic way to make them helpful, I could not recommend them."
5,Great Product!,"I don't understand what the other reviewers are talking about. This was the easiest thing to use. I installed it, and was using it withing five minutes. I designed my current kitchen. I was able to tell the program what kind of cabinet, size, height of hang, window, door, appliances, and then see it in a 3D walkthrough. This is an amazing program. If you can't figure this one out, this is what you should do: Unplug your computer, put it in a box, and send it back where you got it from. You shouldn't be using a computer."
1,Not good if you have more than one room,"I have tried numerous times to get this software to work but have found that it consistently freezes up with even simple house designs. I have repeatedly contacted the on-line support service and have been advised to decrease the video performance, get new video drivers and shut down all other programs on my computer. None of this has helped. I bought a new 3D video card that supports 32MB SDRAM and still had no success. This is the first time I have bought software that just did not work. Mattell would do well to take this off the market, do a bit more research, and try again. I wasted dollars on the software as well as on a new video card."
2,Mischievingly over[priced,"The quality of book both in content and presentation is low. The writer introduces his recommended technique and then explains some of his experiences and some historical view but without even trying to reason why it happens what happens or to generalize it - what the reader learns is just an opinion that could be heard anywhere from anyone without any sensible support for it. The presentation is also very low quality. It is more like the book is a photocopy of a hand script or something. Bottom line, doesn't worth a penny."
4,Helpful Reference,"This book helped me learn the basics, I would use it as a reference when I was not able to ask my instructor questions. The book's organization seemed odd at first, but as I progressed it turned out that it goes over material in the best way possible. This book, however, is not a Teach-it-Yourself book. I feel that the same goes for all martial arts book, its only a supplement. As a supplement on the Sword it is effective in communicating the skills needed."
1,Don't quit your day job,"I have always enjoyed the light humor and spontaneous comments that McCord brings to television commentary. However, this is a boring, and disappointing book. Gary would do well to have someone else edit his transcripts for literary flow. The choppy sentences and introduction of too many characters in each chapter, makes the book difficult to read. I got through the first two chapters then tossed it back on the shelf to collect all the dust it deserves."
5,A Work of the heart....,"This book is not your ordinary story, it is the blood, sweat and tears of a brave family suffering from generation to generation with Muscular Dystrophy. Christine O'Hagan should be proud of how elloquently she is able to share her losses from her brother Richie to the ultimate loss of her own precious son Jamie.She shares so much in this book, you can't help but wonder how she was able to sit all those long hours and re-live so much sorrow. But don't be fooled. Christine knows just how to tell her story with her very fine sense of humor which has always beenher strong tool through her struggles.A book to read not only for the journey of her life, but also for what it gives the reader.... The true meaning of what live is about. God Bless you Chrissie."
3,disappointing,"After reading ""The Uncommon Reader"",by Allan Bennet, I thought I would try some other books by the same author. While they were humorous to a point, they by no means held up the same way as ""..Reader"" did. I was very glad that both stories, ""The Clothes They Stood Up In"" and ""The Lady in the Van"" were extremely short!"
4,Love Them!-,They are so handy to use... And make it easy to clean breastpump parts. The only draw back is you have to let them sit for 10 min. if you don't rinse them off.
4,"good idea, and they work.","These are good for the price. Used mostly to secure a guide for saw or router for smaller cuts. They are easy to maneuver, quick on and off, and hold adequately if you don't test them beyond the capacity of a plastic clamp. Price isn't at all bad either, compared with what you -can- pay if you try. They won't do everything you need a clamp for, but they'll do a lot."
3,"Great stories, poor quality","The stories are well told, though I wish they didn't use the word ""kill"". On day two my 4 year old dropped it flat on it's back from about two feet up and the cover ripped and the binding came off the spine. Wish it was more durable."
5,Ike Truman,"This is a fabulous first book by a very good writer and poet. The poems here are well crafted, full of colorful language and are topical for the time in which they are written. There is everything from South Africa, to the lack of black writers in the educational system discussed. It is all done well too. Third World Press hit a home run with Gilmore's first book. And, of course, what an incredible title.Ike."
3,Looks great but ............,"Looks great and was very excited to try it out, however it doesn't fit on my xl specialized globe. The front rest plate doesn't have clearance on my handle bars. However it was very easy to install and actually came the allen wrench needed, Overall I would recommend it to anyone with a bike that fits."
1,No room for the rider,"As pointed out by other here, when installed, the weeride doesn't leave any room on the top frame bar, which is really dangerous when you need to stop in a stop light. I have a fairly large frame and didn't work for me. I am returning it."
2,not made for larger kids,"Seems like a well put together and well made seat, but I bought this for my 17-month old, who is at the top of the percentiles for height and weight. She weighs about 29 pounds at 17 months, and barely fits into the straps. She is also fairly tall and the adjustable foot rests were just about too short already! Not recommended unless you have a little peanut!"
4,great idea,"this is a great idea. my grandson loves it. i feel better about having the child in front where i can see him instead of the back. the only down side is it makes it a little tough for turning, but you can get used to it and it will work fine. good purchase."
4,Awesome ride.,"Just got this seat today and was well worth it. Only problem i had was finding longer bolts to go in the front due to my large triple clamp forks. Also seat is a little wobbly back and forth but was quickly fixed by wrapping a little foam around the frame of my bike to prevent rocking side to side. This thing is so comfortable to ride with. My one year old daughter and I rode for miles. The only adjustment to my riding style was having to pedal with my knees a tiny bit wider than usual but even that only took a few minutes to get used to. This thing is awesome, a must have!"
4,Awesome product!!,"Cool!! This it great baby can see everything. Very sturdy on the bike, I even installed it myself. Works great I always get inquisitive looks from people. Have ended up a couple of times stopping and talking to people about the bike seat. Great Product would buy again and again. Excellent!!!!"
3,think before you buy,"I read all the reviews on this product & was convinced it would work great. What I did not consider, however, was that the seat goes right between your legs as you are pedaling. I have to bike with my knees sticking out & it is not comfortable for long rides. Also, my daughter's helmet hits me right in the chest while I'm biking (she's only 11 months). I fear that as she grows, we will need to get a different seat or a trailer. I am 5'6"", so maybe it would be okay for someone taller or for men. For women my size or smaller, I would not recommend. I wish I would have considered these things before purchasing. If I could make the choice again, I would have gotten a regular baby seat that goes on the back of the bike or a trailer."
2,Has potential,I was really hoping this would work. Hinders your pedaling and comfortably. You have to stick out your knees and ride in order to avoid you legs getting scrapped up from the seat. I have adjusted everyway possible and tried 2 different bikes. Let down...
5,MUST HAVE!!!!,I can honestly say whoever came up with this product is genius!! My 5 year old spent her younger years looking at my back and now my 15 month old enjoys seeing where we are going when we ride!!! We have had multiple people stop us to ask where we got the Wee Ride!!! LOVE IT!!!!
1,I don't think so,"I did not like this seat, and so I returned it. I am not sure how it is supposed to work or why someone would try to put their kid over the top tube of their bicycle but it is a bad situation. It makes it hard to pedal and my daughter was trying to get all up in my steering. I also have a nice hatred for it because I now have a small scrape in my top tube in the shape of a circle where the long metal piece that holds the seat on cut through when I was tightening the knob."
4,Toddler gets a great view,"This seat is great! Our daughter loves it. She is 3 years old & still uses it. She is pushing 40 pounds, is almost the size of a 5 year old, and her feet almost don't fit in the little foot holders now, but we have gotten a lot of use out of this seat. The shoulder seat belt is too small now, but we are still able to seat belt her around the waist. Depending on the type of bike you have, the bar makes it a little hard to steer, so it takes a little getting used to. I like that the child is near the center of gravity on the bike & can see out. Compared to back-seat carriers, this one is easier on the tires of the bike. I would recommend this to anyone who has a 1-4 year old child."
1,Very misleading,I bought this seat the other day at toys r us for my 3 year old son to sit on so we could go for bike rides. I got home and took it out of the box to discover that the seat was so small it looked like a seat for a doll. VERY disappointed with this product. The box says it's designed for children over 1 and up to 38lbs but it clearly is not
2,Not for tall people,"This product in design is a good idea, putting the child up in front of the parent so they can interact and the child can see where they are going, but talk about poor design for the parent.I am 6'2"" and my knees are now bruised thanks to this seat. Dont get me wrong, it is possible to ride with this on your bike, if you are willing to ride bow legged. If you hit an uphill stretch and want to really pump on the pedals, be prepared for some pain because its tough to get some torque on the pedals if your knees are splayed out to the side.I am going to return this one and buy my next option, the green front mounted seat. The reviews on that one seem to solve my problem. I will keep you posted on how that turns out.Add in the poor strapping system, and somewhat shaky mount, and this is only a 2 star product. It better be 4 stars or better, after all, this is the safety of my son I'm talking about."
2,Great but....,"This is a wonderful way to talk to your child and have more interaction while riding. By far better than the trailers and rear mounted seats I have tried. However there are some things you need to consider:- Turning radius of the bike is restricted- Does not handle child up to 40 pounds as stated. My son is two and is 50 percentile height and weight and is just about too big for it.- You have to ride slightly bow legged for you not to hit the seat with your knees. Its not good for long rides, can be very tiring."
5,WeeRide is the BEST RIDE,"The seat does not compromise your ride as the typical ""back seat"" rider or ride along. My daughter can see the view in front and not just see side to side and a view of my back. It is very stable and sturdy and easily transfers to our other bike. I am very, very pleased with this product and would tell anyone thinking of a child bike seat that this is the best option."
1,I would not recommnt this!,May not fit every bike! It didn't fit ours! I didn't feel safe puting our daughter on the seat - it didn't offer much support for her. Plastic is very flexable!!! I returned it immediately!!!
2,Need to drill hole on one of the center bars,"You need 2 pairs of hands to attach this thing to the bike. We needed to drill a hole on one of the center bars so the 2 bars can be screwed together.If I knew this beforehand, I would have returned it in a heartbeat. However, we have already installed the 2 bars on the bike before we realized the lack of hole on one of the bars. Either we got a defective one or company who produces this does not have a quality inspection procedure.I would have given this product a zero star had it not been that my child absolutely loves to ride with me using this.For all of you reading this, get the i-bert-safety-seat available here on Amazon or on ebay. It's more expensive but a lot easier to install and more comfortable for the biker (this is according to a friend who bought the ibert.)"
5,Love this!!!!!,"I just got this for my 12 month old. He is 22 lbs and very average size, he fits perfectly. It installed well on my elecktra cruiser 7 but we had to switch the screws it came with so they were a bit longer in the back of the mounting bar. My son loves it and so do I, he is in my arms the whole time. I'm 5'9 and 135 lbs and my knees do not hit. I highly recommend this!!"
3,good product but needs improved safety harness,good solid product that was easy to assemble. needs an improved safety harness with a strap across the chest like a car seat instead of relying only on the hip level straps. The back could also have been lengthened to provide additional support.
2,"nice idea, bad design","The idea of placing the seat in front of the rider is a great one. However, once installed I realized that the bulk of the item prevented me from pedaling comfortably, as the insides of my knees kept rubbing against the outside of the seat. I tried adjusting the mounting brackets higher and lower to see if it could help, but neither made a difference. I am a male, 5'9"", 185 lbs, and I installed the seat onto a mountain bike. I can only imagine others have experienced the same thing. I do not suggest buying this seat."
3,wee rider,Everything about it is great except that when the child is riding between your knees like this you have to hold your knees out a little while you pedal. It is a bit of a pain. It would seem obvious but I didn't think about it and now I think I would rather have the baby on the back of the bike again for that reason.
2,Disappointing,"I was realy looking forward to using this as I'd prefer to have my son where I can see him. I was VERY disappointed. First, the seat is way too small. It says it can accomodate up to 40 lbs. My son is 25 lbs and just barely fits into it. It would never have lasted him more than 2 - 3 months. I've seen other reviews that have a similar complaint.Second, many bikes, including mine, have a handle bar shaft that rotates all the way to the base; therefore, you can't attach the seat on one end.The concept is great, the design of this seat is definitely not"
1,bad quality product.,Release does not work out of the box. poorly made. The internal rod pushed out but never retracted to original position. Useless. Returned
5,"12"" cable release",The ordered item arrived in just 3 days so I could shoot with my film camera the same night. 5 stars
2,Don't buy it!,"I saw this book in a book store, and I must say it is very very mediocre. The quality of printing was quite bad, the colours were nowhere near as good and this book doesn't highlight the incerdible talent of the Russian-born artist. There are such art book of quality nowadays! (It's as if this book had been printed in the 60's!) I would compare this book to a soup with no spices and salt. If you're looking for a book on Chagall that really shows how great and lunimous his colours and paintings were, don't buy this book: try to find ""Chagall"" by Jacob Baal-Teshuva (Taschen) or ""Chagall: The art of dreams"" by Daniel Marchesseau. Those would be the smartest buys you could do!"
4,Magic!,How an invention this simple and obvious took THIS long to become mainstream might be one of the biggest mysteries of this century. Every home that lacks a pro-athlete should own at least one of these. My only complaint is the price. I found I could get a 3 pack of equally effective ones at the dollar store.
4,does the job,"This was a lot of money to pay for something I used to get free from businesses and political campaigns, but I found that opening lids can be very difficult without one. This one is quite solid and hopefully will survive my husband's sometimes creative uses for it better than the thinner version we had before."
1,Sold a Lie,Was advertised as a lie to sell a one row radiator. This is totally misleading and dishonest to send a one row radiator in lieu of a real 2 row radiator.There are no ways to contact you by phone to tell you of the total bovine scat and total horse puckey this is. Way to go Amazon for allowing this.
2,Noisy and Broke,"Cleaned regularly. Quiet for the first 6 months, then the compressor got very loud. Continued to operate for two more years until the fan motor burned up. Parts for repair were gonna cost about $60, but I decided to buy something quieter instead.Might be worth $80 new. Definitely not worth $100+"
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"I was very disappointed with this steamer. The power of the steam was insufficient to remove wrinkles. I went over the same area repeated times and the fabric remained wrinkled. I tried it on shirts, pants, and table linens. Very poor results. I could not recommend it."
3,Not all the signs are accurate!,"I was enjoying my new set of flashcards until I realized that many of the signs shown are not found in an ASL dictionary as the proper sign. So while the concept of learning via flashcards is fun and encouraging, I feel the need to cross-reference every word in case I'm learning the wrong sign. I will, however, give part 2 and 3 a chance!"
5,Awe-some!,"This is awesome! Here is a pretty vivid explanation.* It is 1935, and Indy must race against both the Nazis and the Asian crime syndicates to possess the legendary Heart Of The Dragon* Travel with Indy from the jungles of Ceylon to the underwater palaces of Istanbul to the violent streets of Hong Kong* With help from his beautiful partner Mei Ying, he'll use his whip and gun to avoid traps and survive street brawls & martial artist wars* Leap, swim, climb and punch your way through exotic locales as you survive an adventure just like the movies!Also here are some cheats.God mode:Hold L + R and press Up(2), Down, Up, A, X, A, B, Up, Down, Y, Start at the ""Press Start"" screen. Note: Use the D-pad. A song will confirm correct code entry. You will become invincible with unlimited ammunition."
2,"Much too sweet, and bad nutrition","Although Glucerna seems to help avoid low blood glucose, it is sweet, sweet, sweet! And, ironically, full of things that are otherwise bad for you, like transfat and palm oil, and little that is good. Another brand of diabetic snack bar is not likely to be worse, and almost certainly would be better. The makers of this bar don't care about our health: just our money."
4,much more fun than it has a right to be,"this little horror/action/ comedy(yes it really is all those things ) is just so much fun you can't help but like it. the monster is a cheesey blast,the action is well done, and the comedy is very funny is a sick way.not much sense as a cruise ship about to be highjacked is attacked by ""sea monsters"" from the deep. like i said this is just to much fun to take seriously and if you let it you can get sweapted away with it."
1,Deep Rising doesn't play,"Received dvd and doesn't play! It's the first one I've ordered that on any dvd player pops up a message and says ""Doesn't play in your region"". Tried settings, different folks dvds with same result. Seems to have been a waste of money/frustration buying this particular movie."
2,Good graphics and not much else,This was a pathetic attempt of a horror flick. The plot was awful and the monster okay. Save your $$$$ for something else.
4,Deep Rising,"This movie has a ton of action. While it's not exactly intellectually stimulating it is a fun check your brain and grab some popcorn sci-fi action flick. The fictional Chinese assault rifle they carry is very cool and the movie doesn't have slow boring spots, it's fast paced till the end. Check it out for an alternative to shark movies."
3,Aliens at sea.,"I like Treat Williams. I like Famke Janssen. I like movies about ships lost at sea, and the toothy creatures that lurk in its depths and look on people as savory entrees. Oh, and I definitely like the Alien series.All that explains why I sort of enjoyed Deep Rising, a rollercoaster of a movie that tosses all pretense of originality out the window from the get-go and focuses on doing the same old thing in a fun and flashy way."
4,DON'T MISTAKE THE NAME!!!,"When I told my family what I wanted for Christmas (Deep Rising) I recieved a copy of Mercury Rising and Deep Impact. The film was intended of being a B film but don't give it so much ""Bad Vibes"" it's not that bad of flick. Just think of it as Titanic with Leo getting eaten by a Giganic octapus thingy. The best scene is when you see all the dead bodies in the ball room."
1,Now what?,"Cliché, abuse, rape... poor effects, bad cast. Hell Leviathan was 100 times better than this."
3,Deep Rising,"From the the director of ""The Mummy"" Stephen Summers movie before he made the massive hollywood blockbuster came this film which had a decent run in the box-office and was a hit on video. Stephen is good at what he does creating fun for the viewer making silly gags and corny acting. Deep Rising doesn't scale any great hights but it provides a decent fun time on your lounge room couch on a rainy saturday night."
3,Mindless but thrilling!,"If you liked Aliens or Predator, then you'll like Deep Rising. It's a very cliched and predictable monster thriller, but as long as it makes me jump out of my seat it's fine. And this movie made me scared plenty of times. The plot and acting is totally B-movie quality (the passengers and crew of a luxury ship are killed by a huge sea monster, and a group of thugs stumble upon the scene too late), but the special effects and gore scenes are very elaborate. Also, the characters are pretty charming at times. The movie wastes no time getting right into action, and the action it has is incredible. Rent it for a good but forgettable scare."
1,The Band is Brass under the Plating,"Bought this watch as a graduation present for my grandson. It was everything he wanted; analog, chronograph, calendar, and BLACK. That was important. He wanted a black with silver watch. Within six weeks of receiving the gift, the black plating on the watch band started wearing off on the outside. Now, some 10 weeks into the wear, the plating on the inside of the band is coming off on his wrist. That's how I know the band is brass. He loves the watch. He does not like the brass. Very, very disappointing!"
4,Fabulous piece.... but a little too heavy!!!!,Easy to understand and use...once you go through the manual briefly. Looks great.
5,great watch,I got this as a gift for my brother and he couldn't be happier with it. Nice features and design.
4,pulls on arm hairs,"This is a great watch. Its got a seizable heft to it and feels high quality. It looks great and has plenty of features. I only have two problems with it. First, the LED screens are hard to see (the newer skyhawks with atomic timing have backlight screens). The second problem is that the watch is very painful to wear, as it plucks out arm hairs between the watch links as it moves around your wrist. I have not had this problem with watched that lack interlocking links (the kind that have a band that will go flat, and not hold an oval shape, when placed on the band). For this reason alone, I give it a 4 out of 5. But buy it if you don't have arm hair."
4,Funny nonsense!,"Let's face it, Mr Rich is no Hemingway! This a funny collection of booze stories and photos - I liked it."
2,Printed in CHINA!,"Although this is a very attractive and thorough book, it is a disgrace to our Marines who love and fought for this country to have it printed in China.It's time to show support for OUR COUNTRY and our troops Buy American!"
5,"Outstanding, informative and gives the Corps Honor","Received my copy for Father's Day. It was a great present, but I would have bought it myself after reading it. it is one of those type of books that you will share with others over and over again. The pictures are outstanding, the stories are to the point and very well researched.While I wished it would have spent more pages on the Vietnam War, the book is after all about the Corps and I have enjoyed it and continue to refer to it often."
5,Love it!,"So refreshing, and it doesn't burn the bejesus out of your mouth like a lot of mouthwash can. This is the only kind that we use! (although it is cheaper at the grocery store, oddly enough, than on Amazon)."
5,Immediate results,This was a great buy. I am glad i have it. I will never go back to regular mouth wash
2,"Short cable, short antenna, short signal","I got this card to replace my Microsoft G card because I wanted to have my PC on the floor, and it only got reception on the desk. This unit would allow me to remotely have just the antenna on my desk. When it arrived, the cable attached to the suprisingly short (less than 3 inches) antenna was not enough to make it to the top of the desk! If your tower is on the floor, this cable isn't long enough to make it to a standard desktop. After putting my tower on a stack of wood to elevate it, it still had no signal. I repositioned the tower to it's original desktop position, and still had ""very low"" signal when I used to get ""very good"". Overall, waste of money-pass on it."
3,Be forewarned,"This is not what you'd call a politically correct album; Dr. Bombay (and his new alter-ego, Dr. MacDoo, his Scottish brother) are in fact a Scandinavian Euro artist. The songs are poppy-happy (insanely so, with almost-English lyrics that *nearly* make sense) and the music keeps on a-bumpin' but some might find the stereotyping offensive: Dr. Bombay drives a taxi in Calcutta, lives with his enormous extended family (much of which was eaten by a tiger) and sings of his love for curry and rice. On the other hand, I have Indian friends who love this stuff precisely because it is so over-the-top. It's addictive, goofy stuff."
4,finally something for us Indians,"i bought this album from reading the reviews on this page. Boy! was i glad. this is the funniest thing i have ever heard, and being an indian i totally relate. i thank dr bombay for doing this album and for his great sense of humor. you can laugh and dance to it at the same time. good at family gatherings,, a must have. but you gotta like techno music though."
3,Good Rockin' Here,"I finally received this concert and I am not disappointed. This show was filmed in a small club, & makes U feel like U are right there in the room. These guys can really rock, Jim McCarty is one of the most underrated guitar players ever. I'm glad I bought the cd & now can watch em live. I really try to give each of my reviews the right words so anyone who reads them can decide for themselves what to buy if U've never heard them."
2,Like I've Always Been Told...,"...if you have nothing nice to say about something, then don't say anything at all.I know this isn't much of a review, but it's the best I can do under the circumstances.IF you can make it through this once completely, good for you.I couldn't.I wanted to, but I couldn't.Nuff said."
5,Excelente product !!!,Recomended for all papermodelists and enthusiasts.The models are in high quality gloss paper and is very simple to mount.
5,Daughter of Mine,"A must for any father who is about to see his daughter marry. ""Daddy's Little Girl"" is a song of the past."
2,Just OK,"After reading the reviews for this CD I thought I would try a copy to get the song ""Daughter of Mine""It was an OK song but I found another song on (Amazon.com) that I liked much more for my father bride dance.Its called ""A Song For My Daughter""The words to this song are much better and it was nice to get both a male and female version of ""A Song For My Daughter"" so it could be from my dad or mom. We used the male vocal and when dad and I danced everyone had tears in their eyes.Joyce Russo"
5,Just what I wanted,I ordered these as a Christmas gift for my husband. They were exactly what I wanted. My husband loves them.
2,Beautiful glasses but......,The glasses are beautiful but the first time we used them one cracked. They don't have a level bottom so the wobble on the table. Not worth the price.
2,SummerSlam billed as FELL the HEAT yeah right,123 kid defeats Hakushi- pretty good match and they had a good cruserweight paced fight 8.5/10HORRIBLE tag title match please fast forward 4/10HHH pinned Sparkplug Holly- this match did not make HHH under any circumstances. It just got his finisher a big pop. bad match 6/10Barry Horowitz pinned Skip with the help of Hakushi- horrible match thats all i have to say 5/10Undertaker defeated Kama in a casket match- very suprised this match had a lot of good wrestling and one bump 8.5/10HBK defeated Razor Ramon for the IC title- very good match with some awsome bumps. I thought the athletisim in the 2nd match was better than WM 10 10/10Bret Hart defeated Issac Yankem by DQ- this match had a couple boring spots not much wrestling and a horrible ending.7/10Diesel pinned Mable for the WWE title- by far the worst main event in history of the WWE. Diesel wins by a clothsline. 5/10Overall- 6/10Best match- Ladder and casketWorst match-all of them exept the opener
1,No es Karaoke,"This isn't Karaoke. No lyrics display. This is strictly music without a vocal track. The lyrics are included in the liner notes, in little tiny print. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, the music is nicely done, and sounds like Mana.Este CD no es Karaoke. La letra no sale en pantalla. Es tan solo la musica sin cantante. La letra viene en el papelito que va dentro de la caja de CD. No era lo que esperaba. Sin embargo, si eso es lo que buscas, suena bien. Tal cual como los temas originales."
1,A long wait and inevitably cancellation.,Amazon never delivered and took months to cancel my order. Poor showing for amazon on this one.
1,Tattoo Goo is HORRIBLE,"I recently bought this product for a tattoo I was getting. Well needless to say I got that tattoo and this product did not do anything good for the tattoo. I used it for 2 days, and the tattoo was scabbing, and very dry. Once I stopped using this product and started using another, which I'd used before on previous tattoos, it looked 100 times better within a matter of a few hours! I would NOT recommend Tattoo Goo to ANYONE!!!!"
3,Good Buy from Amazon,"Amazon had the best price around for this grill. Grill performs it's job well, but as my experience has been with other Foreman grills, easy to use, hard to clean."
4,"George Foreman GRB72PG Broil Grill, Platinum","Very happy with this grill even thought the plates are not removable. I was looking for a grill with removable plates, but decided on this one after reading several reviews. I have the smaller one and like the way it cooks. I am more concerned with how it cooks than how it is cleaned. I used the cleaning suggestion of putting a couple of wet (but not dripping) paper towels on the grill and closing it immediately after cooking is finished. Works great. No scrubbing just wiping. It fits 4 1/4 lb. hamburgers, which is mostly what I have used it for. I did notice some smoking. It seems to get a little hotter than the smaller one.George Foreman GRB72P G Broil Grill, Platinum"
4,An excellent class book,"We used this book in our Quickbooks class. Combined with the pre-entered data for some of the exercises, it was incredibly useful for learning Quickbooks.Perhaps it is a bit dated today, but it could still be used without too much difficulty to learn bookkeeping on even the newest versions of Quickbooks."
2,A reasonably good book for novices - not for professionals,I found this book lacking for my needs. I am a professional bookkeeper and was looking for a Quickbooks book that would show me some of the lesser known aspects of the product. This book kept to the basic material which you need to do the basic functions. I also forgot that the payroll part of Quickbooks is a seperate product in Australia and was irrelevant to me.
4,Good read,I really liked this book I have not read anything by this author before. Some people found the Daughter Gracie annoying but I liked her baby talk. I do think the editor should of looked the book over more hence the 4 stars.
5,Even Elvis fans will like this book!,"This is the first book I've read by Susan Andersen and I was NOT disappointed. Emma and Grace Melina (""Baby Beans"") are on the run from an overbearing guardian who has a dark secret. Emma's car breaks down outside of Port Flanery and inside the town, Emma and Grace meet Sheriff Elvis (""Elbis""), their soon-to-be protector. And then the adventure, and yes, a little fun begins. The climax - when the guardian, Grant, catches up with Emma and Grace, will keep you glued to the pages!"
2,"Beautiful photos, but a bit of a disappointment.",Beautiful photo's but short and a bit of a disappointment for quilting lovers.J Becker
4,ACTUALLY CALLED A NIGHT IN,THIS CD is a great chill out CD. BG picks great tracks but fails to mix them together properly which is why he didn't get five stars. This is a great cd for chillout fans.
5,"First Alert 2118DF Steel Fire Safe with Digital Lock, 2.0 Cubic Foot, Gray","After reading some of the reviews my expectations were kind of low.I'm very happy with purchase. It gives me a piece of mind that me valuables will be safe in case of fire.Safe is heavy at 140 lbs, but probably not heavy enough for two strong guys to carry it out of the house.Overall I think it's a very good product."
3,Arrived Dented,"Packing includes putting safe in box. No padding. It arrived dented on top and side. It going back today... hopefully without any problem. Also there is misleading review by Weber which say packing is impressive. I bought it thinking that may be amazon learned from customer and fixed the issue since reviews complaining about packing were old and good review was written in 2009...... but nope ..... not yet. If nicely paid amazon/honeywell exes can hear me ...... USE PADDING TO PACK SAFE WHICH WEIGH ABOUT 70 LB. IF YOU DONT THEN IT GETS DENTED IN SHIPPING..... D*** it. It has padding on top and front side, its matter of using five more sheets of same material which should cost less then dollar.Product its self looks good and solid built. Only if they knew how ship it.... it might get 4 or 5 star."
4,"Great for drying sponges, etc","To prevent cross contamination I like to have at least 3 different sponges on hand. This rack has open slits that help dry sponges quicker so that bacteria doesn't multiply. There's also plenty of room left over for my soaps, My fruit wash spray, and my dish washing gloves. The middle part is narrower than the rest to allow for tall kitchen faucets."
4,A good game!,"I found this game to be very enjoyable. Yes, it was challenging the first time, but that's what makes it fun. Anyways, I recommend Phantom of the Knight to anyone that likes Scooby-Doo."
1,Poor quality,"For some reason, this CD-ROM has flaws described by one of your other reviewers too. I bought this for my son as a special reward. We could not install it and had to contact support from the manufacturer. Their help was useless. We returned it and got a new copy. The game was slow, the characters spoke out of synch, parts of the games did not work. We returned it again and bought something entirely different. We are now nervous about buying ANY games in this series despite the fact that my son loves Scooby Doo."
4,Oxford Standard Writing Desk,The table is built very well. The color is a little more red than I expected. The table works well for me. It is a good buy for the money.
2,Disappointed and Mis-Leading,"I thought that I was ordering ""Dusty: The Classic Biography Updated and Revised"" by Lucy O'Brien, but I received the original book that was published in 1989 prior to her death. I wanted the revised version. Otherwise, I enjoyed the book to that point."
4,Cheap and does what it is supposed to do.,"Title says it all. Calling these strain relief boots, if you have ever used them you know is total bull. These are best called anti snag boots. They keep the tab end of your ethernet cables from snagging as you pull them back through bundles. They also allow you to color code your cables by network, pick say blue for your eth0, orange for eth1, white for eth2 and so on... They hold on nicely, and are flexible enough to keep me happy."
4,Good way to color code,It's cheap and it works. Good for color coding cables. Beats climbing under or over searching for the correct cable.
5,"Note to Don DeLillo fans: ""Birdwell"" is DeLillo","Haven't read ""Amazons"" yet (Amazon.com is still searching for it), but Cleo Birdwell is the one-time nom de plume of Don DeLillo, who wrote the 1997 best-seller ""Underworld,"" National Book Award-winner ""White Noise,"" late-1980s best-seller ""Libra,"" and literary cult favorites such as ""The Names"" and ""Ratner's Star."" If ""Amazons"" is anything like DeLillo's other works, it is full of social satire and commentary, with hilarious dialogue. Hope to find it soon!"
2,Man Visible & Invisible is Not Visible,"This particular inexpensive paperback version of this book is virtually (and I mean that literally) useless. There are numerous references and explanations of illustrations--of which there are none.If you are interested in this topic, you might want to skip the frustration and expense of ordering this version of the book."
2,I wouldn't bother.,"I bought this album after loving the songs ""Letter to myself"" and ""Are You The Walrus?"" I have these 2 songs on Tooth and Nail compilations and these 2 songs are definitely HITS! 5 stars. But the rest of the album does not stand up. Pity. If you have these two songs, enjoy them and don't worry about the album. If you don't have these 2 songs by all means get the albums for these two but don't have high expectations for the rest of the material."
1,"a must ""not"" have","If you like great vocals.If you like great guitar playing.If you like great songs.Avoid wasting a cent on this piece of garbage!!!Let me explain. First the vocals are so overbearing, overdubbed and anoying that if you want to hear any of the guitar you're out of luck. The solos are okay, but the levels are way too low to realy catch it with all the rest of the song noise going on.... The guitars in no way even come close to what Jason Becker and Marty Friedmen are playing.All in all this is the worst CD i've ever purchased.Stay away from this one."
3,"Well written and executed music, but too exhausting","To those unfamiliar, Blind Guardian's style is essentially a blend of speed metal, European fantasy-based power metal, and their own unique medieval sound. Their latest offering is well written, well produced, and well executed, but unfortunately, it never gives the listener a break. Bands like Opeth are able to fuse their exhausting music with softer acoustic breaks and instrumentals to make the heavy parts hit that much harder, but Blind Guardian's music ends up a blurr of ignored emotion. I'd only recommend this to hardcore Blind Guardian fans or people interested in the genre of fantasy metal."
5,And Then There was Silence= best song ever,"The closing track on this CD is enough to warrant buying it. The song is truely amazing. The fact that the song runs 14 minutes and repeats the chorus only three times is astounding. The song may be 14 minutes, but it doesn't feel that way, it's not an experience like Peter Frampton, the song flows by and is incredibly enjoyable. Other stand out tracks include: The Soulforged, Battlefield, and Precious Jerusalem. There are no bad tracks. If you liked Nightfall in Middlearth then this album is a must, but if you cannot be pried away from Blind Guardian's very old heavy sound then you may not enjoy it the way I did. If you've not yet heard Blind Guardian then this is a good album to start with."
5,"Good metal, excellent band.","Well, I like Blind Guardian's new album more and more with each listening. Everyone I know says ""Blind who?"" I don't care. Excellent album. Check out Nightfall in Middle-Earth too, I think it's their best album ever. After a few more listens to A Night at the Opera, or ANATO, I think both will be at the top of my metal list for some time."
4,Mellow beauty,"Paul Simon is a master craftsman, and we find him having some fun on this odd collection of songs. The multicultural percussion is still here, as well as a very light touch in all the instrumentation sounds. There are moments of great beauty and poignancy. Be it said, however, that this album will not be viewed in retrospect as one of Simon's best achievements. (There's no shame in that, since his best achievements are incredible, but I feel the need to let you know not to expect overmuch. This is a more homespun little effort.) Here he relies on occasionally wandering melodies (a la Joni Mitchell) and more simple rhymes. A few tracks (such as ""Pigs, Sheep, Wolves"") are downright bizarre, but give the man credit for doing whatever he damn well feels like and not worrying about being overly commercial. It's always been one of his strengths. If you want a mellow album, there have been no better ones this year."
2,Once too often to the well,Simon deserves credit for popularizing world music sounds but now that folks have caught up to that his effort here sounds gimmicky and tired.
3,Decent...clearly not his best work,"Although I am a huge Paul Simon fan, I, like many others, am disappointed with this album. On a positive note, there are some interesting instruments featured throughout the album and the clarity of the HDCD recording is incredible. However, considering the fact that Paul Simon is known as one of the top songwriters (probably the best alongside Paul McCartney in my opinion), it is surprising how poor some of the lyrics are on this album. The song ""Love"" is a perfect example (just listen to the bridge in that song). Not that the album does not have its moments. I think the song ""That's where I belong"" is comparable with some of his best work. ""Senorita with a necklace of tears"" and ""Old"" (although too short) are other standouts. However other songs like ""Darling Lorraine,"" ""Quiet"" and the title track are a bit dull. Overall it is a decent album, but since our expectations of Paul Simon are so high, you can't help but be disappointed with it."
2,short shelf life,"As has been pointed out ad nauseum, this record's various virtues are not readily accessible; they do bubble to the surface eventually. The problem is that its many obvious faults never disappear, and in a short while one tires of the whole thing, virtues as well as faults, baby as well as bath water. Simply put: you shouldn't have to work this hard to enjoy a product this perishable.I like little bits of lyric here and there, but not any whole songs--""The Teacher"" comes closest, I suppose. I hate ""That's Where I Belong"". I like the ""release my fists at last"" line in ""Quiet"", but consider the rest of its lyric--as well as its music and noise--rubbish. ""Darling Loraine"" rambles; ""Love"" never quite comes together; etc."
4,A Sleeper,"I was disappointed when I first played this CD. I left it in my car CD and let it play for a couple days. It is a _very_ good CD. The songs are complex (he ""thinks too much"") so not much hope for airplay for the 13 year olds, but the songs are all solid. I caught myself walking around humming ""You're the One."" ""Pigs, Sheep and Wolves"" makes me smile. His song about growing old strikes a chord.Buy the CD, but don't play it just once."
3,Simon's Apocolypse Now,"As I listened to this CD, I recalled an interview in which Paul Simon apologized for his ""sophomoric"" songs like ""The Dangling Conversation"" and ""The Boxer.""Would that this album had a song that equaled either. Nothing on this CD grabs you, and Simon's voice lacks the energy, the sincerity, that long-time fans have come to expect.This CD is to Paul Simon what Apocolypse Now was to Marlon Brando -- Simon mumbles and stumbles his way through the set, but we are left with the feeling that we are witnessing an artist past his prime. We are left yearning for the ""sophomoric"" music that made him famous, the music that made us love him so, and the music he now apparently disdains.There is nothing here that is memorable or lasting, nothing that you'll want to share with your friends or your children.Still, Paul Simon is a genius whose works will endure for generations, despite ""Your The One."""
1,Pure junk,Impossible to get on and off and I have 3 bad connectors that cause 2 different channels to go out. Would not buy again
4,Like seeing the episode you missed....,"Well, I'm a Farscape fan, and if you are too, you'll probably like this book. I sure did. Overall, the story might be a touch on the light side - you can pretty much tell where things are going. There aren't too many surprises, but there are a lot of good laughs in the typical Farscape vien. I had a lot of fun reading this book. It's a very good romp with the characters I know and love."
4,Works as advertised,I only leave 5 stars if I am impressed. This charger works just like the OEM for my T-Mobile Shadow.
2,You get what you pay for,"I've had this product a little less than a day and it stopped working - It seems to have a short in the power pack because when you tap it, the light comes back on. Ive bought other chargers from the same manufacturer and had no problems, so I would buy from this manufacturer again but its not worth the time to try and get a replacement for such an inexpensive item."
4,Solid Machine,"The Bicep Tricep Machine by Body Solid is a very well built and sturdy exercise machine. It really works the biceps to the max. I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the fact that the instructions that come with it is basically useless. It gives a diagram of the machine and it's parts and that is it. You basically have to figure it out on your on via trial and error. It took a good hour to put together. Once you figure it out and put it together, you have a good machine. Other negative is they are slow in shipping, but this is balanced out by the fact that the shipping is free. Buying it through Amazon is a big plus because you save a few hundred dollars on quality machine."
2,Interesting but more advertisement type of book,Interesting but more advertisement type of book. The author writes about our environment and a lot of times pushes you to takes supplements of Standard Process manufacture
1,Towel rack,I bought this towel rack last summer and the arms of it bent as soon as a wet towel was hung on it. The heat seems to melt the arms. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Jeff Golub does it again!,"From his time in Avenue Blue to now, Golub continues to mesmerize listeners with his unique guitar sound. His music is relaxing and stimulating at the same time as it touches the souls of music lovers. If you like sexy guitar music, you will love ""Temptation."""
4,Cinemax music,Buying this for my father who loves fine guitar work but cannot rock as hard as he used to. Upon further listen this music sounds A LOT like the kind of background music that gets used in a lot of softcore porn that one might find on Cinemax at 3AM under names like Nightcap or Sensual Desires. Hilarious.
3,Eh....,"It's ok...not as cool as I thought it would be.My son loves the intro song, and they only play it on time on the DVD at the very beginning. Not before each episode."
2,Questionable content may be inappropriate for young children,"It pains me to write a negative review about one of Sesame Street's shows, but parents should understand that this box set contains the DVD ""Families, Mail and Bath Time!"", in which children are exposed to homosexual families where two dads are raising a baby. This content was not appropriate for my young viewers and so we are unable to enjoy the rest of the Elmo DVD."
1,Really Disappointed,"I thought this would be the answer to my knee problems but I was really disappointed. This knee brace does not feel the least bit comfortable when you walk. Furthermore, if you follow the directions for size, the knee brace you get is way too small if you have a knee around 18"". This brace is so uncomfortable about the only place I could ever wear it is in bed! I would definitely avoid purchasing this brace. It looks great in the photos but is not comfortable. I had a friend whose leg was much smaller try it on and she had the same results. Avoid!"
5,Flatbush Cowgirl is the real thing!,"Flatbush Cowgirl is a sensual daydream captured through an honest first person lens, an unfiltered lens that fearlessly, unapologetically looks back at all of the infinitesimal triumphs and heartbreaks of growing up. Golda Solomon has deftly constructed a cinematic tour of the past that exposes the universal in all of our memories... the children's playground songs, the eye too heavily made up, the clumsy kiss, the tingling syncopation of jazz. Golda Solomon's poetry is as fresh and real as it gets...no posing, no pretending...this is dark black coffee on a cold rainy morning. It hits the spot hard. I'm already waiting for a refill. If you love the sound of the language as it is spoken; if you can hear music in honest speech; if you look for poems that elicit smiles, shivers, or sighs via subtle consonance and well-placed parison, then buy two copies of this and give one to a friend. This book deserves to be widely read."
1,Barely readable (0 stars),"Not only is the subject matter of this ""novel"" silly, but its literary merit is not even worthy of one star. As if the plot wasn't bad enough, Rhinehart's proper use of grammar is, well lacking. Save your money."
3,Banging my head against a wall,"This book could have been incredible. The characters, the orginality. This makes it all the more annoying that the actual narrative is so hit and miss! Maybe this is what you'd expect from dice theory, but Rhineheart keeps on twisting the story from porn to thriller and back again. It is worth reading, but don't be affraid to skip pages."
5,REPEAT LISTENER,"LISTENING TO STEPHEN HAWKING'S THEORY'S AND PROJECTIONS, I'VE LEARNED THE TRICK TO UNDERSTANDING HIS WORKS IS TO PLAY IT OVER AGAIN. SOMETIMES I'LL PLAY HIS AUDIOBOOKS TWICE IN A ROW, THEN PLAY IT AGAIN A FEW WEEKS LATER. THE UNIVERSE IN A NUT SHELL HAS SIMILARITIES THAT ARE IN HIS CAMBRIDGE LECTURES. HIS ""ASSAYS"" AUDIOBOOK ALSO HAS SIMILARITIES. HIS IDEAS ARE PUT INTO UNDERSTANDABLE TEXT. SOMETHING YOUR AVERAGE SCHOLAR PROBABLY COULD NOT DO. IT'S FACINATING TO CATCH WHAT'S BEING EXPLAINED AND SAY""WOW"" OUT LOUD. KEEP THE GREAT WORK COMING."
4,Very helpful guide,"If you are about to become a user of Stata, or if you already have worked with the program for some time, this guide is likely to be of great help! It introduces you to everything from setting up a dataset to engage in programming. It is rich of examples. The book has saved me a lot of time, and it is really a short cut, instead of consulting the reference books.Due to its size (339 pages), it is not a comprehensive guide; you will need to use the help command and the reference material as complements to this guide. It loses its fifth star due to limited coverage and its incomplete index."
3,Complete Glock,A very good look at the mechanics and structure of most Glock pistols however now outdated a little and doesn't include the newer models but all in all a very good video for people who work with or around guns or a firearms training class especially with the growing popularity of these pistols.
4,Spiderman game,"I bought this game for my grandson so I cannot review the game personally, but my grandson seemed to like it when he played it at my house on Christmas. He may have given it a highter rating."
4,Loved it Great descriptions Great storytelling,Realy enjoyable book and very easy to get into it and not be able to put it down. Great desscription just love it looking forward to more from this wrighter
1,1/2 the tests didn't work at all ...,"I bought these in addition to the ovulation tests. Half of the tests didn't work: the reference line that is supposed to show up so that you know the test is working - WASN'T THERE. I ended up buying the more reputable brands (answer, first response & ept) and have not had any problems with them at all."
3,"It's McQueen, but it's cheap.","My two boys love Lightning McQueen so they would love this toy no matter what but it is a nearly $50 toy that is CHEAP. The plastic is brittle, the eyes are stickers that were lifting when we received it and got accidentally, partially ripped off the first hour they played with it. If it wasn't Disney's Lightning McQueen and just a regular car with the same features, I feel like I could find it at the cheap toy section of Wal-mart for $7."
2,Not worth the money - phoning it in.,"The author seems to be resting on his laurels with this book, which does not inspire any ""a-ha"" moments."
5,Not what I expected!!!,"I was hoping to read sci-fi. Wow, if you find this in the sci-fi section of your store, it is mis-shelved. Please notify the store clerk. This novel is merely a comedy. And, it should be shelved with Sherlock Holmes, not Neuromancer. The setting? Victorian England, not outer space.I LOVED IT!!!This is one of my top ten favorite books of all time. If it hasn't already been done, this needs to be adapted into a stageplay. It reminded my of the vaudeville productions I used to attend as a child. English accent, derby hats, situational comedy, and witty, witty, bantering dialogue. Giggle, giggle, giggle. That's what this book will make you do."
4,Loved it,"This book is a real kick in the pants. Plenty of action, humor, and some great characters, to say nothing of the dog. The ending may be slightly predictable, but still a joy to read."
4,What fun!,To Say Nothing of the Dog is a lighthearted romp through Victorian England (to say nothing of the Blitz and a few other time periods). Willis even seems to adopt the style of some of the comedies of the era.
5,LOVED this book despite NOT liking Doomsday,I decided to give this book a try despite the fact that I hated the Doomsday Book. I am so glad that I did because To Say Nothing of the Dog was a real joy to read.
4,Not what I expected - but wonderful on its own,"I had a hard time getting into the start of the book because, as others have said, I was expecting science fiction. Yes, there is time travel - but for all that it doesn't follow the basic sci-fi outline at all. However, once I got into the book I thought it was hillarious. I couldn't put it down once I was half way through. Yes, the story has been done before (Oh no! We changed history!) it was the characters and the humor that made the book. Very enjoyable, very funny, well worth the read."
4,To say everything about the author,"With apologies to Jerome K. Jerome, Robert Heinlein and the Marx Brothers, this is a unique book. It is a victorian drawing room comedy, a time-travel tech, a love story, a mystery, and a locked-door who-dun-it.Like a Marx Brothers movie, the plot is too intricate, and half of it makes no sense until you've read half the book, so I won't even try to summarize it here. Needless to say it's interesting, though after a while I found some of it hard to follow (I kept loosing track of the character's relationships to each other) because so much was going on. But all that was missing was a little shakesperean crossdressing, and people running in and out of doors.It's just a very happy book to read, and I do have to say that I even liked the dog (but I won't say anything about the cat)."
3,A fun and interesting romp -- eventually,"I have to admit that I almost put the book down after the first fifty pages, and again after the first hundred pages. After that, however, I was hooked. The first part of the book relies too much on slapstick and a couple of characters that are really caricatures (Terence, Professor Peddick). However, the book eventually finds its stride, introducing characters that are interesting, funny, and easy to connect with. Also, the plot, which plods along for the first part of the book, becomes more and more intriguing. This book really would have been excellent with some judicious editing of the first half, but I'm glad I finished it."
3,But they do talk about the dog!,"Its a wonderful fun romp that is a combination of a Victorian piece and a sci fi novel that involves time travel. Much like the oft mentioned Three Men in a Boat, this is a novel you can think about, or you can just enjoy the ride with."
4,Loved it!,"I was really surprised how light and funny this book was after reading the exciting, fast paced, and stomach-churning Doomsday Book. I think one of the reasons To Say Nothing of the Dog comes across as light is that it takes place mostly in the Victorian era, a time when people apparently acted ridiculous. The humor of the book covers up the scary implications of changing the course of history. Also, I was so happy that Dunworthy was in it, I enjoyed him so much in Doomsday Book, I hope he shows up in more of her books! I've also read Bellwether (it is great). I plan to read all her books!"
3,Relentlessly amusing,"I view with suspiscion any book, play, or movie that labels itself ""hilarious""; they are often at best only mildly humorous. A mystery fan, I bought this book for the quirky title, not realizing it was categorized as sci-fi, but I was pleased to find that it deals with one of my favorite genres, time travel. The writing is so relentlessly amusing that the humor ceased to have an impact on me after a while, but the story is well plotted, the characters are appealing, and I really loved the dog (to say nothing of the cat)."
4,Excellent!,"A great read, excellent characterization in all things. Loved the relationship between Ned and the animals. Don't necessarily need to read the first one in the series to understand this one. Could easily be a stand alone."
3,Was The Editor Put To Sleep By The Kikuta Gaze?,"I decided to write this review because there is a possibility the Otori series may be made into a movie.The book should have stopped either before or immediately after the battle of Takahara! Lian Hearn lost focusand allowed the characters to turn into people who where nearly unrecognizable. Such as Muto Shizuko, arguablythe strongest female character who went from being the leader of the Muto family, into a grieving mother awaitingdeath by starvation. Hearn should have left good enough alone with the ghost of Yuki. Bringing to life an evilapparition motivated by revenge on Takeo made little sense. I was also irritated that a map showing Miyako,Takahara and other new locations was not included in my book. However, I enjoyed the majority of the book as wellas Hearn's storytelling."
1,CONDITION OF PRINTED BOOK IN BAD CONDITION,Was totally disappointed with the quality of this book. Sent it back for a refund. Will purchase the book elsewhere as it is for a gift and the quality should be pretty good to give someone for a christmas present
4,Love the series in general,"So I found out this book was being released by complete accident. I loved the first 3 and was anxious to see how this one wrapped everything up. I didn't like Kaede at all in this book. She annoyed me to no end. I was also not completely thrilled with the ending, although I do believe it finished off the series and didn't leave any more questions. Overall it was a good read."
1,"Not very helpful, lack of new information",I was very disappointed with the so called field manual for loan signing. Half of the book was blank lined pages for notes over 50 pages. I would not reccomend this book to anyone with any notary experience.
4,sandals,"I love these sandals. they are comfortable and stylish and perfect for those of us with not so perfect feet, because they have alot of coverage of the part of the foot that shows bad nails, white skin or prominent veins."
5,Much easier than what I was used to!,"This cable came as a good price ($.01) ^_^ Plus shipping if course, but it makes putting all thos pictures on your computer so much easier if you don't have a card reader. I used to have to email the pictures to myself in order to get them. Not anymore! Other reviews recommended going to the Nokia web site and downloading the software insteard of using the cd, that's what I did and I haven't had any problems so far."
5,Nice!,Delicious great value since they are much more expensive at the grocery store it’s a great buy. good idea for some stocking stuffers too!
5,Great quality product,Everything about this collection is first class. The pictures on the site were accurate - I was glad I made the purchase - it saved me hundreds of dollars compared to the retail mark-up from my other distributor of patio furniture. I ended up purchasing the whole collection!
2,Wow! This is really a long movie.,"How many adventure movies of this type have heroes looking for a lost city in the jungle or a kings tomb buried under the sands of the Sahara Desert or an under water cave with riches beyond belief and when they find it, it begins to collaspe all around them and they have to flee for their lives. Well, this is another one of them and actually not a very good one of them. If I was restricted to review this movie with using only one word I would have to say ""Boring""."
1,3 hours of Long and Boring,This movie is 3 hours of boredom. Maybe they could have edited out eighty minutes of horrible dialog. I fell asleep so many times. Five of us watched it and all were disappointed.Please read some of the other one star ratings. I do not want to waste anymore time on this movie but just want to warn others. I am amazed some people have watched it more than once. I feel I wasted 170 minutes of my life. BTW there are no deleted scenes and also Jerusalem is no where near the coast.
1,The Last Templar,"Anyone who gave this movie a three to five star rating has an I, Q. of less than 100. Therewas absolutely nothing good about this movie including the actors performances, the direction (which was horrible), and the screenplay. I pity anyone who has wasted there money in purchasing this DVD and worse than the latter having to sit through this miniseries. I personally removed it from my DVD player after 30 minutes."
3,Poor quality item,"I purchased this item over a couple of years ago. The shave quality has been reasonably good, and the linear motor has been trouble-free. However, the overall quality of the product is poor. The rechargeable battery now holds almost no charge. To make matters worse, the HydraClean cleaning system is flaky to the point of being unusable."
3,"Problems, ok for its price range","This was a step down for me from Braun and I had to return it. The really stupid feature is that it won't shave while it is charging -- who thought of that? It is a problem because the battery life on this isn't nearly as good as my Braun. Second, and maybe this was just my unit, sometimes when I turned it on, it would just click but not shave. I would have to charge it some more or squeeze it or turn it on and off to get it going. That at least enabled me to return as defective. Third, the trimmer wasn't good at all compared to Braun.All that said, it does shave very well. If you can't afford a $100+ model, this may be a good one to try."
2,Not a great stocking stuffer,"If ""It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"" suffered from too much mean-spirited humor, this special suffers in the opposite direction. It's overly cute and cloying (and not all that funny, either). It's so over-the-top sweet that you'll get cavities just for watching it. It's safer for your kids than ""Very Merry,"" I guess, but I can't imagine them wanting to come back and watch this bore-fest over and over again.As in my ""Very Merry"" review, I recommend ""Muppet Family Christmas"" and/or ""Muppet Christmas Carol"" instead."
5,A thinking person's book with some interesting plot twists.,The novel had an interesting premise and wasn't just another version of other book ideas I have read. It also kept me guessing about what might occur next and how the conflict would be resolved. I enjoy reading books that I don't feel I could have written so this was a good read.
2,History is subjective.,"Although First Mothers is an interesting topic, this book had a few serious flaws. The author is obviously a journalist, not a non-fiction author. The chapters felt a little choppy, and the lack of a firm timeline was confusing at times. Also, there was a strong bias throughout the book, particularly in favor of Rose Kennedy. It was an interesting book that was obviously researched extensively. But it was a bit too nostalgic."
1,Worst book I've read in years,"First Mothers was the choice of my book club. Poorly written. Disjointed. Total waste of time. If you're interested in these women there are much better choices out there. I forced myself to read about 3/4 of the book so I could be part of the discussion. Other than the person who chose the book, no one liked it."
2,Not the best way to train my ear.,"There are several enjoyable ways to train the ear: Listening to jazz tunes, transcribing those tunes, playing along with those songs and playing through fake books. There are several ways to train the ear that are not much fun: Playing intervals and chords yourself and listening to someone play intervals and chords. Isolating intervals and chords from real music makes for dull exercises. Maybe they're useful, but where's the enjoyment? I'd rather listen to the great jazz icons on my CD player while looking at the lead sheets in fake books."
4,A Good Look At Boot Camp,"This text is an excellent guide to parents and would-be soldiers who have enlisted or are wanting to enlist. It examines the boot camp expereince and talks, generally, about Army life after graduation. The boot camp experience is well described and illustrated with photgraphs from recent classes. Some details on materials trained, such as Army Values, and Soldier's Creed are included.I do not recommend this text for personnel currently serving in the Army since the information is so elementary, it would be of little value. However, I would highly recommend this text to Recruiters who are helping applicants and their parents to understand the Army experience.Overall, well written and well illustrated with no technical flaws to speak of."
1,Do not buy,"Safe worked great for several months. Then one night I heard a noise and tried to get into it. It would not accept my code (the small lights wouldn't even light up), and then it locked me out for a while. Got into it later with the key. Found the batteries were good, but replaced them anyway. Same problem again. So I left the top open for the rest of the night, only to find that the safe would emit random beeps during the night. If this safe always worked as good as it did in the beginning, it would be great, but this problem is unacceptable."
1,Save your money,"warped right out of the box....Sportsman's Guide did issue a pick-up slip that I didn't ask for. Repackage, reship,remove the wax again is just too much to ask...Just more junk from China.....Save your money"
1,Other care plan books are much better than this one.,The care plans and interventions provided in this book are very limited.
2,Dissapointing for an avid Elvis Fan,"I was expecting much more from this video. It was basically home video taken by someone at one of his concerts. Not very good. Also, the audio portion, was very disturbing. Should have been more insight as to what brought on his speech."
2,Shot block review,"The shot block is not worth what you pay for it. The blocking mechanism is cheaply made, and is mistimed. The blockers fly up at odd times, generally after the ball goes through the hoop. The ""chatter"" that broadcasts is okay, and my 12 year old grandson seemed to enjoy that aspect of the toy. After playing with it once, he put it away for the rest of the week. Good sign it is not a very good toy."
4,Change is a Good Thing!,"I love Berg, because she can take a bore like Myra Lipinsky and make her interesting. She can take a homely, unpopular, loner and create a world where she can become beautiful.Myra is a 51 year old nurse who lives with her dog. She seems satisfyed to stay that way until one of her ""home visits"" happens to be the gorgeous, popular, sensational football player of her old high school, Chip, who by the way, never noticed that she existed, (since she was dim and unpopular)Until now....This book is about two people who would have never met under normal circumstances. A loney,solitary woman. A man with a deadly brain tumor. But Berg allows love to enter in, hope, dreams. And we all adore when the ugly duckling is beautiful in the eyes of the quarterback!Myra needs Chip as much as he needs her. And even if time is limited, they take the hours they are given.Only if we could all live like that!"
2,Boring,I got about half way through this book before I finally realized I really don't care about Myra or any of her patients. She is boring and needs to stop feeling sorry for herself and get a life. I'm not going to finish this book and it won't bother me one bit that I don't know what happens.
4,Good book,This is a story about how a single woman finds love in her life. Myra is a strong woman with many people around her who care for her but she doesn't see her life as this way. Elizabeth Berg writes very well. Every single line in the book pops up at you. The story is simple and yet very true. I liked it a lot and will try Berg's other books.
2,had it with quirky,"Take a stack of 3 by 5 notecards and jot down the following plot themes: quirky minor characters, dying football hero, middleaged friendless visiting nurse, beautiful highschool cheerleader alone and getting old and cool dog. Shuffle the deck and put them in a book. If the setting was Baltimore, you wouldn't know if it was an Anne Tyler book. I just can't take anymore quirky characters. The dying of cancer theme was okay, the romance, doomed as it was, was okay, and the dog worked. But all those insightful though odd patients of hers, helppppp....Ms. Berg is best when describing the simple life of a woman. This time, she gives us an unlikeable heroine who is somehow beloved by all her patients, who attracts the dying love of a former high school stud and who beats out the homecoming queen in a quest for his affections. The one good part is the final resolution when Myra finds out she's worth loving. But oh dear, it takes so long to get there."
4,Touching...and laugh-out-loud funny...,"""Never Change"" is a perfect Elizabeth Berg book. She takes a wonderful fairy tale, infuses it with unconventional and the most unlikely heroes, spices it with her cleverly-crafted irony, and keeps us laughing with her self-depreciating sense of humor. The result is a perfectly believable, romantic fantasy that is a pleasure to read.Berg doesn't indulge in the ""bodice-ripping"" imagery of other romantic fantasies. Instead, Myra Lipinski, a 51 year old visiting nurse who sleeps with her dog, guides us through this sensitive love affair with the man of her dreams, as she removes her inhibitions and her poor self image, one sensible shoe at a time.But wait! This is not ""Cocoon."" Berg's characters and story are kept young and vibrant by the wonderful characterizations of Myra and her far-out patients. And the author's characteristic sense of humor keeps you reading.Great reading with more substance than your average summer reading book."
4,Never put it down!,"This is refreshingly different look at a typically dismal situation. In this book, Ms. Berg demonstrates that sickness and death do not have to be as terrible as one thinks. In a fantastic novel with several poignant moments, two high school acquaintances become reacquainted later in life. This is one that you don't want to miss!"
3,Cute earrings but too short,"I really love these earrings. They're silver, they're leverbacks (so you won't lose them), and they are cute! The only problem is that these earrings are definitely NOT 1.5"" long. They are maybe .5"" to .75"" long. If you have short hair, they would be wonderful, but with my mid-length hair, you simply can't see them. It's kind of disappointing..."
4,"Not slick, but has good info","This DVD is combined text and video. It is not a DVD that you sit back and watch straight through as a video. It looks like a couple of old Utah fish biologists did it with a handheld digital camera, so the result is definately not slick and polished. However, it is competent, and has much good information, especially the text component, on a wide variety of subjects.I have some pretty serious problems with the casting demonstration, and if you want thorough treatement you probably ought to look at the Joan Wolff DVD.You are probably better off using this on a computer with DVD, which is where I am watching it, than on a TV DVD player. It's organized basically by chapters and it is more useful if you have something like a mouse to select what you want to look at. It really looks like it was intended to be used as a supplement for some form of high school or junior college outdoor recreations course."
5,This book will likely change your paradigm...,"Walter Winks' exposure and analysis of the domination system and its ""myth of redemptive violence"" changed the way I think. This is one of those rare books which provide new insights into everyday life, and in the process, forever redefine the way you look at the world. Brave, articulate, and oh so relevant to our day and age."
3,Welcomed But Not Exactly Triumphant Return,"I'm a huge POSIES fan and was always hoping they'd get back together. EVERY KIND OF LIGHT is a ""good-enough"" return for me, but I would not say that it is GREAT by any means. This album is just not very consistent. I would rate it about equal to SUCCESS, sort of a twin sister to...I even think the sound of each album is very similar. The best tracks from that record and this one would have made an amazing collection...maybe even as strong as their classic FROSTING ON THE BEATER. I recommend LIGHT for sure but I just can't rave about it. If you're a fan you'll love it. CONVERSATIONS alone makes it a worthy purchase."
1,Generic and boring,This Bryan Adams-esque album is throughly unoriginal and uninspiring. Everything on the album has been done before. Totally undynamic and uninteresting.
3,Not a translation!!!,"This book was long in coming and, at least in Europe, it has been rumoured to be a translation of Karma Chakme's famous ""Mountain Dharma"". What a disappointment to see that this is not so. While Khenpo Kathar's teachings, based on Karma Chakme's root text, are clear, lucid and to the point, the title in itself is misleading. It should rather read something like ""Teachings on 'Karma Chakme's Mountain Dharma' as thaught by Khenpo Karthar"". A good book, but not the translation many have been waiting for..."
3,Nothing really new here,"I got this book with much anticipation because of his previous book Jesus, Jewish Theologian. I was expecting some in-depth analysis of Paul's theology and how it related Judiasm to Gentile Christians. I was disappointed because the book was very sketchy and he basically took the discussion in Jesus, Jewish Theologian and applied it to Paul. In fact there was much redundant material between the two. He also repeated the same details throughout this book. If you haven't read anything by Young, find Jesus, Jewish Theologian and read it. Otherwise, save your time and money."
5,Great Book,"In my personal studies, I'm trying to figure out what Christianity looked like during the first century, by peeling away all of the theological arguments by Christian sages and numerous church organizations.Paul is a victim of constant misinterpretation because we interpret him in light of what we think he has said, however there's a movement to try to understand Paul in his context. This book does a good job of putting Paul in that 1st century context and explaining his teachings as a pharisee.I loved the book. Brad Young is great."
2,Not Happy no support,APC needs to get with it. There are many iMac users out there and APC can't seem to support them. There is no software support for the ups to talk to the computer in case of a power failure. Writing that program can't be that difficult. I would think that APC is a large enough company to support Mac's
5,Mom loves this,"My 82 yr old Mother loves everything about Mr. Lowry. She has all sorts of CDs, DVDs, VHS movies, etc that have Mr. Lowry on them, usually with the Gaithers. When I saw this VHS tape on Amazon.com, I knew I couldn't go wrong with this as her Christmas gift. I was correct."
5,wonderful,"this CD is the best, most relaxing CD I have in my collection. you won't be sorry if you purchase this. it's wonderful."
3,Ok but not great,"This is the 5th in a series of 7. It has a lot going on and setting up for the last 2 books, but it has not grabbed me like the first 4 did. I guess by the 5th one you have to do more set up for the finale. Still need to read it to complete the series, but not as good as the rest."
4,One of my favorite movies ever!,I love this movie! It shows you how long creativity can go even if you don't have a Hollywood budget.
3,Ingredients are a 5 star... texture and consistency of paste not so good,"I use the mouthwash from this same company and love it so really wanted to love the toothpaste.. Its just that I am used to a paste, something that you brush onto the surface, that you can see foaming as you brush.. This toothbrush turns to water I think.. It completely liquifies and endes up dripping out of your mouth while you are brushing. Although my toothbrush runs for 2 minutes, I don't think there is any paste in my mouth or on my teeth after the first 30 seconds"
2,Medium Lasagna Dish,"This product was very disappointing. It should be renamed something else--Small Serving Dish. With luck, the dish might hold 4 small pieces of lasagna."
1,MAKES ME NOT WANT TO SHOP ON AMAZON ANYMORE!,"NONE OF THESE VIDEOS WORKED AT ALL, ALL THESE VIDEOS WHERE SAID TO BE NEW, BUT SEEMED VERY OLD AND USED AND BROKEN ! I WAS VERY MAD IN THE FACT THAT I COULDNT NOT CONTACT THE SELLER OR AMAZON EASILY AT ALL ! I ENDED UP THROWING THESE AWAY, BECAUSE THEY HAD NO USE ! I HAD TO BUY A WHOLE NEW SET FROM BEST BUY!"
1,The The Golden Girls...,"Got these disks as an XMAS gift from my parents. They will play a while, then pause and skip, etc... First they are very compressed versions of the originals ordered from the US (The regular are dual layer disks, these are single layer with the same exact movies), so the quality is less. Next, like I said there are playback issues with at least half of the disks. I don't think it is scratches, etc.. It is the way they were pressed at the factory (factory?????). No visible scracthes, and if you make an exact copy of the disk (no copy protection on them), the problem exists at the exact same place. I would not waste your money on these disks and just spend the few extra dollars and get the American versions."
1,ABSOLUTELY ANGRY,"I love The Golden Girls. I had this set bought for meThe Golden Girls - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7)because it is obviously all of the seasons that were released individually but together in one package. The only problem is that when I get them I put the first disc in and started out working great! That is...it played perfectly...until the 5th episode and then decides that it doesn't want to work any longer and starts skipping large chunks of episodes. I am absolutely furious! Seeing as how it was ordered for me I don't know who to get in touch with, whether any of the other discs are going to be problematic (it is a 21 disc set!), and whether or not I'll be able to get an exchange or if they will even work.That said, save yourself some trouble and go out to a store and buy the seasons individually. At least then you'll have a better chance of them working properly. You may even save money in the end that way. I just want discs that work!"
2,"AT's review of Essential Silver Surfer, Vol.1","I have to say I did not enjoy reading this. I believe it's because the comic was written from a time period where the issues discussed and depicted in the comic were not as relevant to me as reader today. Sure, we still face the similar social issues today, but the way it was drawn and described just seemed outdated to me."
3,Takes time to build,really is a movie you have to watch with an open mind and understand that its artsy.It truly is about art.\There is a great passion and the build up of plot and passion is slow but worth the wait.I really liked it.
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful.","Tragically uneven, INCOGNITO features beautiful European scenery..and an engaging look into the world of fine art.As a suspense thriller, it offers as many twists and turns as the viewer can handle, but repeatedly slows and stumbles through underdeveloped sub-plots, and shallow performances by the main characters. Patric is wonderful as the angry young forger, but fails miserably in any instance where he is to convey sensitivity or romance. Irene Jacob is a wonderful actress, as witnessed in the two Kieslowski movies, but can't deliver the vague Prof. Marieke van den Broeck . As for the storyline featuring Rod Steiger, and his relationship with his son (Patric), it starts slow, before totally petering out all together.Interesting and beautiful as a travelogue, it's worth the rent if you stick with it to the end."
3,A very honest account of growing up in Limerick,"This book was written as a corrective to the denigratory account of growing up in Limerick portrayed in Angela's Ashes. The latter book, for whatever it's literary style, is nothing more than pretentious claptrap and O'Flynn's There is an Isle should be compulsory reading for anyone who thinks Angela's Ashes is an accurate account of it's time and place."
3,Tops McCourt,"While sometimes spending a little too much time on details for the Yank reader this book is well worth the effort. It shows that people can overcome and even thrive in the worst of conditions. O'Flynn also puts blame for these conditions where it belongs; the British. The featured reviewer (Kirkus Associates) must have skimmed the first few chapters. ""There Is an Isle"" is a much better work than ""Angela's Ashes"". Of course devotees of Frank McCourt will miss his constant attacks on Irish Catholic culture, but then again, they have numerous other sources."
1,lousy design. you get what you pay for.,The strap at the top causes the SD card to constantly pop out of the treo and can corrupt your data. The hole at the bottom is not quite big enough to allow you to plug in the synchronizer cable completely - to make a firm connection you need to remove the case. The clear panel makes the touchscreen nearly useless.
1,Terrible!,"I suffered through this because I had to...the only book I had to listen to. It was possibly the worst, most boring, most ridiculous plot I have ever been exposed to!Do not buy, rent, read or listen to this"
2,bad,my son was not able to play this cuz it was hard and that sucks i think they should makes games for kids with special needs to play on these system
4,Ok bowl set - not big enough to mix in,I was looking for a mixing bowl i could use with my handheld mixer that would not get any mess all over the counter. If you are looking for that same thing then you need to purchase something else. The 4 qt bowl was surprisingly small. I stil rate this 4 star because i guess its my fault and i should have known but there is no way i could mix cookie dough or whip cream in this bowl without a huge mess. that being said...the bowls seem to be of good quality and i will use them for something i'm sure.
1,POOR Engineering_Battery Door,"The RCA CDS-6300 camera is a piece of junk and RCA knows it. We all know about the horrible battery life and that is to be somewhat expected. The pictures were good but the major issue is the battery door which fails. It would be simple to engineer a new door for retrofitting. They claim too costly so they ignore it and tell you that the only thing you can do is to purchase a replacement camera. Contacting customer service is a joke either through email or through their 800 number. We need to get together as a group to make them stand behind their product. For what I have spent on this camera, I could have purchased a decent Sony."
5,Easy to use and happy,"I bought this to lug stuff for dog shows. I can fit my 32"" dog crate (with 40 lb dog inside), grooming table and other necessities and haul as needed. Make sure you have an assortment of bungee cords! I am very happy with it, and the ease at which one can make longer or shorter increases the versatility."
5,A fond memory unmarred by ego.,"When hyping this book on the Sci-Fi channel author Robert Bloch quipped ""People will be surprised to find that I have done absolutely nothing of merit with my life."" Ha-ha. The man wrote Psycho, the novel that inspired the movie made by whatshisname. But there is also a bitter truth in that statement, Bloch lived the real working writer's life. The one where he didn't get to go to a great many foreign lands, didn't win national acclaim or even fame (despite the success of Psycho), but worked hard, and mostly broke, at his craft for decades. Both the man and his writings really are overlooked national treasures, both to those who simply read him or those lucky enough to have known him. I miss you Mr. Bloch, you had a great life filled with merit. Highly recommended to those interested in a real working writer's life."
5,Wish I Had This Book Three Years Ago,"I'd have to agree with Marjorie from Ohio. When my only daughter lost her grandpa three years ago (12 at the time) she was distraught for months. I couldn't seem to find a way to explain it so she could reach a degree of acceptance. She was sad, then angry, and would say things like, ""I wasn't finished talking to him yet."" I even took her to a minister and that didn't help.Then I saw the author on television, so I ordered it. We sat together and read it. Each page was like taking a page out of life. Boy, did she boil this one down to a fine broth. And the illustrations are wonderful for kids and I think necessary pauses for adults to digest each page.The very next day I noticed that the book had disappeared from the coffee table. It was in Tanya's room. I said nothing. A week later she walked into the kitchen, gave me a hug and said, ""I think I understand now, mom. I forgot that it must have been hard on you too."""
4,Pretty Good,"This one is really ok, but i must admit there were a couple of ""Un-Darshan-like"" tracks that kinda frazzled me, but it just takes some getting used to. It does however make up for it by cleverly maneuvering over to the throbbing bass, kickin beats and dope-ass sampling that the Good Darshan's known for. Kept me dancin for a good while though!"
4,Who said The Cult were dead ?,"Well this is the first album of Ian Astbury I've listened to since the demise of The Cult, and what can I say - Great ! Ian's singing on ""Devil's Mouth"" is way out of tune (flat as a pancake) but, hey, it wouldn't be Ian Astbury if a few flat notes were not thrown in. ""Tyger"" & ""Shambala (R.F.L.)"" are both a slight distraction from the rest of the album, sounding like they came from a mix of 'The Cult' with 'Gong', 'Ozric Tentacles' and bit of 'Hawkwind' thrown in for good measure ! If it were not for the fact that this was a solo effort you could easily be forgiven for thinking that The Cult had reformed. This is definateltely one for any Cult fan, a great album, go get it!"
5,Wonderful Wonderfalls,"I just recently discovered ""Pushing Daisies"" which, of course, lead to the discovery of ""Wonderfalls."" I just finished watching the DVD set, and I am just heartsick that the show is not only gone, but it's been gone for a while. SIgh. On the positive side, that last show was a good one - you could even pretend that it tied up a few loose strings. You could also pretend it was a mini-series with a happy ending. Does that work? Sort of, but not really. Oh, well, I'll look forward to the ""Pushing Daisies/Wonderfalls"" crossover in a few weeks. And maybe I can find an orange Mold-o-rama lion somewhere."
5,So much potential,"This is another show which was stricken dead before its time. Somewhere between ""Joan of Arcadia"" and ""Dead Like Me"" lies ""Wonderfalls."" A quirky dramedy about a girl who talks to inanimate objects that ""guide"" her into doing what's right. Is it God? Is it some other powerful force causing her to do things for the greatter good, even if it's at her own expense? We'll never know, because this is yet another series that Fox broke before it was even out of the box.It had a cozy spot on Fridays, and Fox moved it to Thursdays against ""The Apprentice"" within three weeks. Haven't the learned anything from ""Family Guy""?"
1,MJ 2,"Another over exploited child star, another future failure. HM/ MC is proof that you don't need to talent to land a movie roll"
4,pick one! but great movie,"I enjoyed it, but the point of her is (sorry to ruin it) pick one! but good movie though, to ruin it for you dont read unless you wantme to ruin it for you, only if you want to, she stays as hannah and miley. some parts made me cry though its a perfect family movie"
4,Thumbs Up From A Mom,"My daughters are 6 and 8. I was so pleasantly surprised by how much all 3 of us enjoyed this movie. This is classic Disney fun, corny humor, and tons of heart. The main 'moral' of the story is the importance of honoring the love of family and friends. We listen to the soundtrack together frequently, and all 3 of us are looking forward to the DVD release of the film so we can watch it togther again...and again!"
4,Workhorse,"We have 3 of these units in our plant. They are about 3-4 years old. They work well. The one issue we have is that the lamp replacement cost is, IMHO, high."
2,Seriously?,"I have eclectic taste in music, and only knew one of the artists received. That artist was Johnny Mathis. Seriously? Cute idea in theory, not so much in reality."
3,Wedding gift for the rocker couple - disappointed,"My husband thinks they're cool. I just wish they didn't have tape all over them. I like vinyl, that's why I put them on the registry. When I opened the package they looked like the center of a record with packaging tape all over it. Doesn't feel like vinyl. It feels like packaging tape. You can even poke a hole through the tape through the center of the record. Kinda cheap for the price."
5,Groovin',"They are fun, artistic, and serve their purpose very well. My tables are not only protected, they've become hip and stylin' with these functional yet neat-o coasters."
5,MASTERPIECE,"This has to be the best box set i have heard and own in a while.. The Isley Brothers still grooving after all these years .. How many groups can see that they have had hits in every decade.. The Isleys 50's,60's,70's,80's, and the 90's.. This great collection illustrates the staying power that most groups could only dream of having .. I really enjoy this cd a whole lot.. The earlier material not to familiar with most of it .. either it was slighty before my time or i was just a lil guy .. Some very interesting music on that disc ranging from 50's doo-wop soul .. to the Motown Era.. Love the song This Ol Heart Of Mine .. Disc Two and Disc Three O man this put in me in heaven all these songs sound great then and even more so now .. I recommend this collection highly for music lovers"
2,NOT LEGIT!!!,"THE CUTS ON THIS ALBUM ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS AND MANY OF THEM SOUND LIKE ONLY RONALD IS THE ONLY ISLEY BROTHER DOING ALL THE SINGING. SO IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF ALL THE ISLEY BROS. ORIGINAL RECORDINGS OF ALL THEIR HITS --- YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET THIS 3-DISC ALBUM!ALTHOUGH THE PACKAGING IS OUTSTANDING, THE QUALITY OF THE MUSIC WILL NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL SONGS THAT YOU HEARD ON THE RADIO OR ON THE ALBUMS THEY WERE RELEASED ON, SO WHATEVER YOU DO, IF YOU WANT THE CLASSICS HOW THEY WERE ORIGINALLY RECORDED. YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET THIS ALBUM"
5,part of my life's soundtrack,this is a must have for anyone born in 1948. so many memories.it will bring smiles when you recall the dances and the clothes.a great collection!!!
1,Not all metal!,"Do not buy this item if you are looking for an all metal tripod. The is not an all metal tripod. The clips, the parts most vulnerable to wear and which really should be metal, are plastic. The hook to hang up the tripod is also plastic."
5,Changed My Life,"I absolutely love this book. Learning how to bake bread was one of the most satisfying things I have ever done and this book taught me everything I know. My favorite recipes so far are Buttermilk Bread and Pocket Bread. Whatever you do, give this book a try and be persistent. It is definitely worth it and once you learn the starter recipe the rest of the recipes will have a similar pattern and will come much easier. Finally, whole grain bread really is great for your health. After giving up refined flour and refined sugar foods for the most part and doing some walking, I have lost 25 pounds. And whole grain bread is really my foundation. I couldn't do it without it. And don't forget to eat your fresh baked bread with a little bit of real butter. There's nothing else quite like it."
1,Wasn't the best book for me to start with....,"I wanted to bake whole-grain bread, and bought this book first, as it came highly recommended. There was a lot of good information, but when I tried one of the recipes, I got a brick. This failure discouraged me from making bread for quite a while. Then I got a copy of ""Breadtime"" by Susan Cheney (which is entirely whole-grain breads). My first loaf turned out beautifully. The instructions and recipes from that book are what turned me from non-baker into a real breadmaker."
4,Good bread book for whole grains,"You will definitely find a lot of information on bread baking/making in this book! Very good book for a beginner, which I am."
3,"Started well, but...","This movie started well with a lot of interesting potential plots. However, somewhere along the way it just lost me. It meanders a bit too much and doesn't always seem sure of what it wants to be. It seemed at times that it was going to be a movie about gay relationships, but then at other times it's more about small town life. The lesbian character Linda just drops out near the end without any explanation. Worst of all, at the end of the movie two random gay guys kiss for no reason. It just doesn't make sense and contributes to the impression that the directors just hadn't settled one what they wanted the movie to be before it was released."
2,Great until the ending,"This movie wasn't quite what I expected. I liked all the depth of character and some of the issues tackled in it. I liked the actors as well. However, the ending really frustrated me. Until then, it was a really wonderful movie."
5,Les Luthiers- Los Premios Mastropiero,"This is Les Luthiers, an awesome/hilarious show just like the others, simply great.One more to complete my collection :)A+++"
5,Terrific show - great DVD,"They say this is the ""best show nobody watches"" ... thank goodness it's finally being recognized with Emmy nominations. Buy this DVD without hesitation, and be prepared to be moved and entertained. It's a gem, as are the other seasons of Friday Night Lights."
3,"Good effort, but cryptic","Somewhere in this book Monod has a good point. The problem is that his writing is cryptic, and the point is hard to find. Even if you manage to do it, you will probably find that it was not worth the effort."
3,calming animal music,Worked on a couple of the cats but not on the two that needed it the most. I can say I did enjoy it but not for every day use.
3,A little long,This was a fascinating fantasy novel and a different take on the fairy world. My one complaint is that it is a little drawn out. I think it could have easily been 200 pages less.
2,Goodbye nobody,"How the mighty has fallen! After Otherland we have this lukewarmTad Williams whit a whiny, self-pitying loser who's also one of the most unlucky charachter in literature. He's called in Fairyland, where all he does is stumble and whine and make an utter fool of himself when a pixie comments on his obtuseness and slowness in ubderstanding situations. The Fairyland is a stereotype whit nothing that hasn't been seen a thousand times, and the only seemingly original idea (the Goblin Revolt) seems borrowed from Harry Potter's series. An utter disappointment. Goodnight nobody,indeed!"
1,dull,"Mr Williams can write and he has proved it, but honestly speaking this book is bad. It is not exactly ill written but that is about all that can be said for it.The story is not awful but it is neither original nor particularly interesting. Characters are not endearing, villains give no thrill whatsoever. Writing is fairly neat but it builds little tension and this book is very easy to put down.I surprised myself to think: ""How many pages still?"" more often than it is good for a fantasy book.Little emotion, little tension, little interest. This time Mr Williams has not worked well."
2,don't buy is you're short waisted,"If you are shortwaisted it hurts your back and your neck, no relief here and there is no way to adjust. For those with a longer torso it works great and is very relaxing. Reccomended back measurements should be listed."
2,Hmmmm ; not what I thought,"I don't give a s--- what anyone says ; Make Some Noise is one of the best albums of it's kind EVER, and Here's the Deal was close, but still had it going on. However..... Hmmm. Don't know what it is. Very scattered, not cohesive. Horn parts get very annoying because once they're introduces, they never change!!!! That's always been the way but it's never been this annoying. I REALLY hope they release a better album to follow up. I'll buy it no matter what, but just didn't groove on this one."
2,Use with Therapy,"I initially picked this up prior to my first visit with my prior therapist. I would say that used in conjunction with a good therapy program this book has the ability to be useful but I wouldn't recommend using it as a sole source of treatment. It has some suggestions that are just completely unrealistic (for example, removing ALL low fat, sugar free and diet foods from your home) and it seems to simplify things a lot. Admittedly, this book is probably not geared toward individuals like me who have been suffering for over 12 years and need more intensive treatment. Worth a look? Yes. There are many sections that helped me come to some important realizations so I would hate to discount this book entirely. However, I don't recommend that you use this while forgoing visits with a qualified counselor."
1,dreadful-------,To start with there are two grammatical errors on almost every page. The proof reader must have had his eyes shut.Then it is childishly written and certainly a work of fictionsurrounded by mostly accurate dates as to what happened when.I would not recommend this book to anyone past grade 8.Peter Oakley
3,Wings 7 Review,"I love the whole Wings series, but in Season 7 after Joe and Helen get married and Lowell leaves, it's not quite as funny. Lowell was a lovable goofball, but the new guy is just an idiot. I guess it's no wonder the show canceled in Season 8."
3,Mixed bag.,"Recorded in the 90's this double live set is a mixed bag. The contemporary performances of the 70's classics are enjoyable and performed well (but still don't compare to their work in that time period). However, the contemporary compositions leave a lot to be desired. The performances are short on creativity and come across as sounding dated and somewhat wooden. Directionless, sorely in need of a sense vision. Stick to Cook for a stellar PFM live performance.Not essential..Simon"
2,Poorly organized book with rambling style,"I found this book difficult to read due to the author's writing style and the organization of the book's contents. The author picks anecdotal evidence from strange sources that are not clearly related to financial markets - not a convincing method in my opinion. The organization of chapters and sections within chapters do not carry the reader through a logical progression of the topic.As someone else said, the author attempts to write like a scientist which just results in a confusing book that does not give the reader a clear message or understanding of the topic. I don't feel any better prepared to ""forecast financial markets""."
3,A novel,"Lodge has written, through documents, autobiographies, notes by famous contemporary writers and friends of James, a novel about the life (or better the last years) of Henry James.it His anxiety, the literary and theatrical failures, his decision to be a ""bachelor"" all his life long.A view of his friendships and above all Du Maurier's. His best friend, who will turn into one of the best selling authors of that time.The conflict between envy and friendship underlines the great humanity of James.It's not a catching novel, but it is beautifully written (like all books by Lodge) and I appreciated very much only after I finished it.For all Henry James lovers, a book to read!"
2,Strictly for fans of Henry James,"I'm not a fan of Henry James. I didn't make it past Page 83 of this book, so my judgment isn't worth much. But if you admire James as a writer and would like to know about him as a man -- a cold fish if there ever was one -- this book may be just right for you. It's even written in a slighlty plummy style, reminiscene of James's writing."
3,Bad choice on packaging/Defective disc,I now need to exchange my season 6 again with a defective disc 4. Same defective disc and same spot on disc.I reccomend everyone watch any box set they purchase in it's entireity to make sure you do not get stuck with an defective disc. This makes 3 times I have had to exchange a box set in 2 weeks!!!!Why change packaging half way through a series? The problem is they hire people who have no passion for movies or shows. Look at how they changed the packaging on the simpsons. The worst!!!!!!!!
4,Very good,"I am simply addicted to this show. But the 7th and the 8th seasons were no so good as the first ones. Actually it starts to go down hill in this one... What I don't like about this season is that the characters start to get very malicious, different than the way they used to be on the previous seasons... so some episodes are just not so funny... However, I own the whole collection and in general I love them all, so I do recommend it."
1,Good luck with applying this film,"Good luck with applying this film to any large then 2 feet window.The application requires at least 2 persons with skills, an exceptionally clean room and a lot of planning and patience.The film has an adhesive on one side, which naturally tends to collect all sorts of dust from any surface it might touch while you working on its application to the window. Once the dust is there it is virtually impossible to remove it.If one is not careful enough an lets the exposed film bend so the sticky side touches another part of film - the piece of film gets ruined."
3,A nice change from traditional country music!,"This CD is comprised of great tunes, that have that new sound. They are in many ways traditional sounding, but in others, they steer away from the original country sound that many people expect to hear. I believe that many more people will open up to this as friends share it with friends. Good work overall, CHICKS RULE!"
5,FLY,I sent this cd to a friend because I have it and enjoyed it so much. The talent the Dixie Chicks has shows in their music and I will continue to buy all they produce. It is a great cd!
2,Not a very good CD,"I was truly disapointed with this CD. It was terrible. Only about one song is worth listening to. The Dixie Chicks dont really use much feeling, and the CD is way to over rated. Its kind of sick how over rated this Cd is. If you want a CD , completely opposite, buy SHeDaIsy: The Whole SHEbang. Those girls can sing alot better than Dixie Chicks. The CD is a big waste of money, you'll really regret buying it."
4,What an Awesome CD,"From the opening notes of Ready to Run to the heart tugging final strains of Let Him Fly, you will not find a more complete country western/country rock offering, this albumn alone has brought me back in to the country music fold. The harmonys, song writing and musicianship are outstanding. These ladies are to be commended, it's no wonder they cleaned up at the CMA's, and yes the Chick's most certainly do ROCK, keep up the awesome work Chick's, you have a fan for life!"
3,Disappointing mainstream pop,"Loving country, bluegrass, chicken pickin' etc. and having seen a charming documentary about charming Dixie Chicks I bought Fly with enthusiasm.Sorry to say it left me disappointed. Mainstream pop country flavour and the ""ooooh oooooh baby"" repeated ad nauseam left me cold. And the lead song too much resembles a chainsaw never idling. Too many times I caught myself thinking ""please stop screaming little girl we know you are there"".A single with Sin Wagon and Hole In My Head as B side would have been a winner."
1,i'll pass,i really liked the chicks until they showed the world that they are insane hippies who hate this country.
4,Dixie Chicks bring new meaning to Country Music!,"I'm not really one for country music, except for the ocasional Faith hill or Shania Twain song to come around. After hearing a few songs on this album (and on wide open spaces, one of the Dixie Chicks' other albums) I really like the beats and melodies and found this album easy to sing and dance along to. If you're a country lover, if you aren't, if you like good music, you'll love this CD! : )"
4,Good country music (!),"Today I bought the first country album of my life. I usally don't like country very much but Dixie Chicks is really good! There are some great songs on this album, ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" for instance. The only sing I think is too much country is track 8: ""Sin Wagon"".This is an album you can buy also if you usually don't listen to country."
5,Slic New Country Chic,"For those of us who dislike traditional bandjo type twang, this group of ladies brings about an upbeat, foot tapping list of enjoyable songs. I especially like the song, Goodbye Earl- you either love it or hate it though. A refreshing cd which brings a nice country breeze into the millinium scene! Enjoy!"
5,"I don't even like country music and still love ""Fly"".","I first heard about the Chicks five years ago, when my dad brought home one of their indie CDs, ""Little Ol' Cowgirl"". I didn't like it all that much so I forgot about the Chicks. Recently I had been hearing from my friends how great ""Fly"" was and once heard ""Goodbye Earl"" on the otherwise dull Grammys lat February, I had to run out and get the CD.I do not regret that move.""Ready to Run"" is a great opening to this CD. ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" is a ballad that Martie co-wrote and ""Goodbye Earl"" is funny as hell. ""Hole in my Head"" and ""Sin Wagon"" are atypical country songs that appeal to fans of pop as well. ""Without You"" is just plain beautiful. I can't find anything wrong with ""Fly""."
1,A dull and twangy followup,"If you like ready to run, save yourself some money and buy the single, because the rest of this CD is blah! Sample that Earl song, where they half sing-half talk, if you like that country ""roots"" sound, then you might like this, but if you expected something like their first CD, which I really liked, then you will be sorely dissappointed."
3,A fun trip!,"3 & 1/2 stars.The Dixie's crafted a nice mix of nu-country/pop and good ole' down south attitude on this second disc. The first four tracks are great. My favorites are 'Ready To Run', 'Without You', and the beautiful 'Cowboy Take Me Away'. The mix is full and the girls musicianship really stands out in places. A few of the tracks bore me, hence the lower rating. Even for someone like me who has NEVER listened to country music, these girls are a lot of fun. Recommended."
5,Great music,I love listening to Aeoliah's music. I find it relaxing and uplifting. I highly recommend this CD and any other CD or MP3 download from Aeoliah's collection. You won't be disappointed.
2,Tango = bad transfer,"Not a bad story. Light on character development.But, good actors doing a craftsman-like job.However, the Tango release is currently the worsttransfer that I own. Technically, the black levelwas incorrectly set when making the transfer. Thisresults in ""noise"" and ""pixelation"" of anything dark.Think of night scenes and dark blue uniforms, etc.You can also see the automatic gain control ""pump""when scenes shift from bright to dark. Also, theMPEG compression is poor resulting in pixelationof suddenly moving objects in static scenes.I wouldn't buy it unless you need to see the prequelto ""Zulu"". Nowhere near the impact and emotionalinvolvement of ""Zulu"", one of the great films."
5,Zulo Dawn - DVD,This was a Christmas gift that I ordered late. I was very surprised to get it 4 days before Christmas. It was a relief and my friend loves it. He has the original Zulu and is a collector so he was glad to add this to his collection.The transaction was very easy.
3,Good Attempt,"If you have any detailed knowlege of the British battles in Zulu Land, you will recognize this was an attempt to fill in the gap after Stanley Baker's excellent movie Zulu. It was unfortunite that Mr Baker couldn't do this production as well. The show lacks numerous detail and the actual battle scenes are disjointed. The incorrect use of carbines instead of rifles is also apparent. The difficulty remains, if you want any film version of the battle of Isandhlwana, this is your only choice. Taken as a whole, the production is entertaining if not somewhat lacking."
2,"Zulu Disaster....er, Dawn","Color and sound way off and terrible. Hard to understand dialog, especially Burt Lancaster's ""frozen smile while talking through clenched teeth"" manner. If hearing impaired, do not be taken in by Amazon's data on this movie. In Product Details, under ""Format"", it states it is Closed Captioned. IT IS NOT!!!This error on Amazon's part caused me to return it for Partial Refund."
3,What is Burt Lancaster doing in this film?,"Despite the theme of the picture, I thought I was watching B. Lancaster in his acrobatics pictures (The Crimson Pirate, for example). Too many somersaults and performances that do not sustain themselves. Not convincing. It is all, less war.Eugenia Lizalde"
3,Necking with Louise,"I thought that the book was interesting. I liked how it was set in 1965 and learned about everything about that time period- Vietnam War, Civil Rights, etc. I thought an awful lot of things happened to the main character, Eric, in the time frame of this story and couldn't relate too much with him."
5,this album rocks,"I actually liked this album better then there first..and the first album rocked!Last one picked is very very uplifting. And is still targeted around girls...cuz in todays society everyone has to be ""perfect"". according to Tv and magazines..and superchick begs to differ.This band has songs for people that might be going through depression, or people not being excepted because there different...and then a song about all the drama in high school and how its pointless.I definatly recommend this cd to anyone."
2,Broke within a few days,"I like the physical design of this hose sprayer in that has separate controls for pattern, volume, and on/off. It worked rather well for a few days and then the on/off button broke and it became trash in an instant. Two stars for design and hope for the future."
1,"Good for really, really young kids","My 4 yr old son is a Blue's Clues nut, so we were really excited when we heard this game was coming out. Considering the amount of time this game was delayed for release I was very disappointed in the quality. It's a miserable, patched job... There are about 4 levels and most of the game-playing is waiting for the data to load so that you can move around the level. The special skidoo games in the game lack complexity and offer minimal learing skills. Steve is poorly animated, and I cringe everytime I hear Mailbox's voice. The last part of the game doesn't involve the player at all, but treats the viewer to a poor imitation of the movie that the game is based on. My son conquered the game in less than an hour, so I sincerely suggest that you borrow the game before you purchase."
2,dull game,my little sister was 4/2 years old when she bought the game she liked it for about 6 months then lost intrest she plays it about once in a blue moon (not very often at all) now. she likes spider man 1 and a bugs life more than this game. this game is also loading almost all the time. But even when it is not loading it is not even as fun as the show(im 10). The graphics are like eric carls books. Dont waste your money.
3,they should make a more air/wick transfer,To expensive for the material used in the glove. Not a good value compared to cheaper gloves that wear out faster and can be replaced cheaper
2,ripped and are too thick,"they didn't last very long, are expensive, and don't have as much grip as other gloves I've used. I'm much happier with the $6/pair Head gloves I got from Racquetworld."
2,not the one I ordered,"well I got the wrong model but was in a hurry ,my old glove broke any way this is as good as the one I wanted,first time I get the wrong stuff from Amazon."
3,Not bad but not the best,"I have a relatively long thumb. I usually wear through my gloves pretty quickly. This ones seems to be holding up a bit better. However, it does not fit as well as many others I've had, particularly around my middle finger. It has been pushing down on my nail the last few times I have played, and that hurts. Also, the grip is white for some strange reason. After one game, the grip was mostly black and my racquet's grip was getting a big lighter."
1,Not the right glove,I ordered this glove expecting something amazing and I never even got the glove in the photo. I got some other ektelon glove. to say the least I am a college student and really didn't want to take the time to send it back and wait for the right one so I played with the one I received and it is falling apart on my pinky finger of all places. Also the black from my grip is leaving its mark on the glove which really isn't helping the glove grip much.
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"This is ridiculous, I was excited to receive this book. I finally get it, and half the pages are completely unreadable!! It looks like a bootlegged copy and the images were taken with a cellphone camera!!! DON'T BUY!!!!"
2,Half Of Them Didn't Survive,"This DVD shows music videos, interviews, and backstage footage of ""Rock Survivors"" The majority of them did not survive.KISS: Survived but haven't released a CD in yearsOZZY OSBOURNE: Survived...BarelyYES: SurvivedSCORPIONS: SurvivedLITA FORD: Did Not SurviveBON JOVI: I Wish They Didn't SurviveSKID ROW: Did Not SurvivePOISON: Survived KindaMEGADETH: Survived KindaEXTREME: DiedWINGER: DiedNELSON: DiedWHITE LION: Should have survivedTRIXTER: DiedKINGS X: DiedUGLY KID JOE: Did they even live?ANTHRAX: Survived KindaSLAUGHTER: DiedThis DVD may have some cool footage, but it is a joke."
3,"Gender, Family and Work in Naples provides just enough info.","While giving precise information on several key issues surronding the subject of this book, the author fails to go into more in-depth discussions on some points resulting in a case of quantity, not quality."
1,this game is AWFUL,"This game is a nightmare. My husband, who is super at all sorts of video and computer games, can't even get it to work well. To rescue the pets, Barbie needs your help to make them not scared, make them come to her, etc. However you try to help, though, generally does not work easily. You will have better luck just randomly clicking until she does what she is supposed to do. Very irritating and disappointing."
1,"why not ""Gnostic Gangster""? or ""Alchemical Alien""?","The manipulative title just kills any pretense of scholarship. More to the point: A) if Jung was creating a new Mithraic church, how come he was advocating poligamy, since Mithraism required chastity?( forgot that one..eh?..Dr. Noll? ) B) Where are the Mithraeums ( the temples of Mithra? ) Know any one, Noll? ( Dont answer ""the analysts office""...u r supposed to be fair..remember..a scholar..right?) C) If so many catholic priests are jungian analysts, does it mean that Richard Noll is smarter than John Paul II? or perhaps John Paul II is...oh ..no ...no...noooooooo....*thump* ..."
2,much fascinating detail but accuracy is doubtful,"I suppose the Jungians need a shake-up from time to time; too bad this author is biased. Still he has assembled much useful background, both biographical and historical, that should help any future biographers. He's definitely done much work! Why can't he present his findings more honestly?"
1,lmao,who tha fkuck would trB^ute this ni99ahhe only B^een rappin fkor like 3 yearsimma B^etter rapper den him and im 14fkuck this cd
3,Good,"This album is simply 'pretty good'. Nothing more, nothing less. It's got some good songs, and it's got some clunkers. I don't think Ashley knows what type of music he really wants to get into yet, and I don't think the band that is backing him up on that album is all that good. Ashley is very talented, and needs to get with a group of younger, edgier musicians, in order to take his music to the next level. Simply making 'ok' music is unacceptable for someone as personable, likeable, and talented as he is.Standout songs on this album are ""Let U Go"", ""Feel so Alive"", ""Soundtrack to Your Life"" (obviously), and ""Crazy Beautiful"". Hopefully he ditches his current backup band, and goes with more edge."
4,Soundtrack to your life,"It is a good cd. The songs each have a different feel to them. Angel is a good artist and so if you like him, or liked O-town then totally get this cd. It's worth it."
3,Didn't Perform Well On The Charts,"The music isn't bad, it just sounds like so many others though.What is very surprising is it's chart performance inspite of all of the promotion that it got. The album and first single both debuted high and then plummeted down down and out of the chart top 100. The album entered the chart at a promising #5 with sales of 72,000. However, the second week it almost fell completely out of the top 40 landing at #37. The third week was another huge fall to #72, and then quickly fell out of the top 100. You really can't say that it didn't get promoted what with a t.v. show, t.v. ads and radio ads and having a top team produce. Maybe it's the boy band thing, or maybe he just says ""DUDE""! too much! Who knows. Music is a fickle business that's for sure."
5,Greatest CD Ever !!,This album has sooo much to offer. The lyrics really paint a picture of what was going in Ash's life while writing them. I recommend this CD to everyone !!
1,Folk Korn?,"Yes, it really does sound like Korn tried to make a folk rock album, and failed miserably at it. I just figured anyone who read the other glowing reviews of how spectacular this album is should hear an accurate description of what's in store for them should they be snookered into forking out $14 for worthless tripe."
5,BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Wakes up even a TEEN!,"Hooray! It works!!! Finally, a product that lives up to the hype! This wakes our eldest daughter for school on her own! No more pleading and arguing to get thisnearly comatose teen up in the morning. Truly a God-send to our family!"
2,Awesome while it lasted..,"The sound this alarm clock makes is like an Atari video game, light flashes, and vibrating disk freaks out! It was a pretty bad-ass way to start the day. Then if broke. The disk goes off every time I set it. Just not a well made product.I am sending it back to the manufacturer because it has been more than six months and amazon won't let me return. Sonic boom say they can repair or replace it...but I have to pay for this shipping to Missouri! x'pWish I listened to the bad reviews they where so true!"
5,loud,"Loud, Annoying, bright, and it shakes the bed... ie it works! I bought this for my girlfriend (now wife) and we've been successfully waking up for 5 months now.The only thing I would change is the brightness of the numbers on the clock.. We turn ours so it faces the wall."
2,Worked for a few days,"As a notoriously hard sleeper, I had really high hopes for this alarm. And for a few days, it didn't disappoint. However, within just a few weeks, the vibrating disc stopped working completely. Shortly thereafter, I apparently trained myself to sleep through the alarm at its loudest and the flashing lights.I bought my son, who is also a heavy sleeper, the same clock in a different shape. He experienced the same issues with his model. The disc stopped vibrating after a very short while and he grew accustomed to the lights and sounds very quickly."
2,"Nice concept, but faulty.","The concept of this alarm clock is a great idea. The exterior of the product was attractively styled too. HOWEVER, I received a defective clock. The minute hand would not change the time on the clock. So I could not even set the time or alarm on this clock. The buttons on the clock are too small also."
4,Baseballs that last.,"These have been lasting pretty well. Nice threads when you are pitching. Remember since they are babe ruth, they are smaller than regular baseballs"
5,Byrds and bluegrass,"It isn't exactly true to say that the Byrds never made a Bluegrass album. This is in response to a review below. In 1968 the Byrds released 'Sweetheart of the Rodeo"", a sort of honkey tonk country album, with Clarence White on guitar, one of the best bluegrass guitarists of all time, playing some excellent bluegrass tunes. For me this constitutes a bluegrass album."
3,To the mountain and back again,"""Comet in Moominland"" is one of the earlier Moonin books. Its a good book, entertaining and fun to read. A children book that is definitively worth reading, especially if you like the Moomin family.In this story, Moomintroll and Sniff noticed a comet is approaching the planet on which they are living. They need to discover what the impact is on them and therefore they start a long trip to the mountains to ask the scientists in the mountains. After arriving there, they take the trip back to find a place to hide from the comet. The book covers this trip.I didn't like it as much as the Moominpappas Memoirs book, so therefore leave it to 3 stars. Though, it is definitively a good children book and a good addition to the your Moomin book series."
5,Great BIG net!!!,"The name of the net ---the Super Cage Mouth Hitting Net--- is exactly what it is. I've been using it for about a month, and I have enjoyed it. The only downside is the lengthy set up and tear down."
2,a fairly unambitious effort by Symons..,"'The Man Who Lost His Wife' is a rather tepid story, and a badly told story at that, concerning a middle aged London book publisher who fears his wife has ran off to (former) Yugoslavia with his business partner. He runs off to snoop on her and finds misadventure of his own. Although not without curious moments, I found this book to be very dull read. The characterizations are especially thin.Bottom line: even Julian Symons fans should give this a miss."
2,for beginners only,"I think this book may be helpful to people who have absolutely no experience with holistic therapies, but if you are not new to alternatives, please make another choice. This book will not be worth your money. It basically lists the alternatives available (homeopathy, reflexology, accupuncture, etc.) and some testimonials for each type of alternative."
4,an ultra-informative resource!,"This book is extremely informative and a great place to start if you're looking to think ""outside of the box"" about fertility issues. I'd also recommend ""Inconceivable"" by Julia Indichova."
4,nerf fun,"I just wish this company had the dart tag set I purchased to use these darts with. Their prices are fantastic, my toy came from Target and was way overpriced."
2,Not recommended as streaming purchase,Bought the streaming download. Very few navigation options. Can not even jump from chapter to chapter. Workout is pretty mediocre too. OK for total beginners but not for much beyond that. I think production values are OK. Shot in the eastern LA basin by the boulders out by the 215 merge.
4,Surprisingly Good,"I'm not into poetry very much, but I really enjoyed the book. It hit so close to home. I struggled with some of the poems, but continued to read and did enjoy the book very much. I have gone back and reread some of the poems and will probably reread the book after another month or so."
2,5 stars?!? Not nearly!,"I LOVE Bruce too, but there's no way this album deserves 5 stars. Not even 3 in my opinion. Shame-Based Man gets a 5, but this one is disappointing. I will buy and watch everything Bruce does (even Dog Park, which also ...), but I won't lie and say they're good if they're not. If you don't have Shame-Based Man, GET IT!!!! It's the funniest album ever recorded by man. And I'm not exaggerating!"
3,mediocre mamet,"this is a slight and unimpressive play, especially when one takes into account mamet's impressive body of work. This play focuses on the huge gap between an older, waning actor and a young promising one. The interaction between the two is often fascinating, and the scenes in which they perform from the play they are acting in are very telling of their 'real life' characters. Overall this was a disapointment, and should probably only interest completist mamet fans."
3,Not sure what to think???,"Purchased 2 tires and put one on the rear first but it was really heavy. I haven't flatted and it worked really well and not too hard to install. I didn't install the 2nd tire because I didn't have continuous flats, then I tried to install it and I couldn't. It was sitting in the box for a couple months in my garage and now the tire seemed to have widened???? Not sure what happened but now I can't even fit the bead in rail of my tire. When one side is in the other rail of the tire is like 2 inches away. So now I have no idea what to do with an expensive tire that won't go on my bike."
4,BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE MY OPINION,"This game is better than the first champions to me because it has two more characters, and it has all these new weapons, armor, items, and areas to go to. I think this game is also a little like the first one because despite what I put above, this game has the same feel to it and its pretty much the same thing just with different details in the game.But I still recommend this game to anyone looking for a good solid rpg experience."
3,I've seen worse games,"You choose a character from the start and you'll be stuck with him or her throughout the entire quest. Other than that, the gameplay is very similar to Gauntlet Dark Legacy in a sense that you mostly run around killing weaker adversaries. I agree with another user that Champions Return to Arms gets rather redundant after a while. Throughout the journey, you unlock newer weapons and armor. The problem is, they just recycle the same designs over and over again therefore greatly reducing the excitement of upgrading your warrior. On the positive side, the game retained my interest long enough for me to beat it. For that, I consider this a worth while purchase."
2,Let Down,"We bought this game for our 3 1/2 year old and although her first reaction was excitement since she'd be able to play something using Daddy's PS2 and best of all, it was a Dragon Tales Game, it wasn't what we both expected.It's slow & boring. As much as you'd like to buy this game, it's not worth it unless you think it'd be great for your child to start off slow. Spend your money on something like a Dora Game for the playstation; which can still be at your child's pace, yet is actually FUN and educational too."
3,Awkward to wear and use.,"I purchased this case to carry my Treo 600 when I was not carrying a bag or briefcase. I already found the Treo to be too large to comfortably carry in a pocket. This case does give fairly easy access to the phone and is well built. However, it creates a large package to attach to one's belt or waist. If you don't mind the ""gunslinger"" look this case may meet your needs. If you want something a little more compact, look for something else."
4,Not the classic album by Magic Sam.,"Just a quick note that this release is not the classic ""west side soul"" that was released on Delmark and the song listing is incorrect. However the music is good early Magic Sam. The sound quality isn't up to the Delmark sides, but you can see Sam's style forming on these tracks."
4,Treo 650 replacement battery,"Gee, what can I say? It's a battery and it works in my phone/PDA. Life is good."
5,Great,Best deal you can get on the Internet. Even good to have one lying around. Shipped quickly and cheaply. Get it for the price alone.
2,not really feelin' this... (2.5 Stars),"T.I. is a pretty decent rapper, one of the best mainstream emcees from ATL, but I'm not really feelin' Bring Em Out. The beat done by Swiss Beats is too bouncy for my liking, and while it's probably fine for the clubs, it doesn't really do T.I.'s skills any justice. Anyone who says this is really hot is either a) not a true hip-hop head or b) from Atlanta. The second single You Don't Know Me is superior to this one, I'm just not feelin' Bring Em Out."
4,Practice practice,I found this book to be very helpful. The explanations are very clear and it gives a lot of practice exams.
4,Great for a little self-taught italian!,"I decided to teach myself italian, and after reading many amazon.com reviews I settled on this book (and two others) to help me. I think this is essential, because most of the general workbooks do not focus on such in depth verb conjugation, and that is so important when learning a new language. This actually made the workbook I got easier to do, because it gave such great explanations....it is very user friendly!"
4,"Uncomfortably funny, as usual","This show keeps with the theme, ""What is she up to now?"" A good episode to watch when life's routine needs a little break."
5,awesome show,I heard good things about this show so I gave it a try. Not dissapointing at all. Krysten Ritter is awesome. I have become a devoted fan.
5,Complex,"Watch this with a few friends and snacks, it goes past being bad and comes back around to being hilarious. Watching it by yourself would probably be a terrible experience though."
3,Incoming sound way too loud,"Plantronics CS351N Supra Plus Wireless HeadsetI have a bit of a hearing deficit so I never expected to find myself complaining that a headset was too loud. But this one was. Set to the lowest possible incoming volume, the conversations were still blasting me out of my chair. I set the volume on my phone to the lowest possible volume as well and it was tolerable. Unfortunately this made my outgoing volume quiet as well, which didn't work.Ultimately I had to return the unit. I'm not sure if I had a defective product, or if I'm particularly sensitive to loud sounds but there wasn't enough volume control to be useful to me.Previously I had a CS50 for three years and really loved that one. Unfortunately it eventually developed nasty static once I was 10 feet from the base, so I've been looking for a replacement."
4,Criminal Minds - Third Season,"I was a late comer to the series, but after watching reruns on TiVo of the show last year, I asked for the first two seasons for Christmas last year and when the third season came out, I ordered it right away. I really like the series and think the shows are well written and acted. My only complaint with the third season was how short it was, but that wasn't the show's fault."
2,Bad Condition,I ordered this dvd because it said that it was in very condition. Unfortunately the box arrived and it is not in good condition. The box is bent and the sides are ripped. If I knew that it would have arrived like this I would have purchased it NEW. I will not be ordering from this company again.
5,Great size for its purpose,"I sponsor a child through World Vision and other than the monthly monetary donation, all additional gifts need to fit in a 6x9 envelope. My little girl is 6 and likes to draw and color, but it's hard to find coloring books small enough to fit in the package. This is just the right size and fits nicely in the envelope with enough room for a pack of colored pencils. The book itself has a wide range of animals so I'm sure it will be entertaining to look through.I'm happy that this line of coloring books exists so that I can send more in the future!"
3,An Army Officer's View,"It was great to find a book published well over 50 years ago, so I could see what ""spin"" the author had on the battle. Surprisingly, the author did not laud Custer--the title comes from the author's belief that Custer was more made up than real. The author, though retired military, made what appeared to be a fair attempt to reconstruct the attacks from the Indian's point of view. The book does not compare to ""Lakota Noon"" in analysis, but the author states at the beginning he is just presenting the facts as reported by others. The book also contained other interesting information from Sitting Bull that even my boss, a Lakota, had not seen. Be warned, though: It's a long book with a lot of self-serving statements by Army officers."
3,"Time attack mode too difficult for kids, but fun for others","It's a fun game to play, but they forgot one thing: the time attack mode switch. It's always on, which makes the game too difficult for younger, inexperienced kids. The only way for them to enjoy this one would be using a Game Genie or Game Shark. However, it's a pretty nice game after the first four levels. The levels of difficulty only pertains to the ""coasting"" effect, nothing else. Small maps, but the time attack mode makes them big. The character art makes it interesting, you get to see more of it on level 4 and beyond."
2,inaccuate information and damaging stereotypes,"It's an old saw that writers should write about what they know. There are so many inaccuracies in this book, particularly regarding Native American culture and history, perhaps Eidison should turn his considerable talents to other subject matter. For example, he writes about Zuni Hogans. The Zuni, a Puebloan people, have never used hogans, which are a structure unique to the Dineh, or Navajo, people in the Southwest. In 1885, when the Army had standing orders to shoot any Apache, man woman or child, off the reservation on sight, it is unconceivable that a group of Apache warriors would encumber themselves with a group of captive white women on a journey of several hundred miles through territory full of U.S. Army forts and hostile Hispanic settlements. This book adds to a plethora of damaging misinformation about Native Peoples. Is it any wonder that the suicide rate among Indian teenage males is 300% greater than the rest of this nation?"
1,worse than I feared,"i was intrigued by the reviews of Gravity' Rainbow so I ordered it. It is every bit as pretentious and boring as I feared. Mind-numbingly boring, in fact. I think this kind of book is only enjoyed by people who like to feel they are privy to a literary higher ground the rest of us don't inhabit and couldn't possibly understand. The story takes place in London in WWII, and the premise is that every time a certain American soldier has an sexual conquest, the Germans send a bomb to that very spot. One reviewer said that the author uses beautiful prose...I can think of many authors who write much more beautifully, and who manage to make their books interesting and meaningful as well."
1,Bottom line: lousy prose,"Who put it into Pynchon's head that he could write? I mean, even the first page of this book offends my sensibilities. I don't care about the supposed ""ideas"" he has, where he went to college, where he worked after the navy--the bottom line is, the man can't write. I think he knows this, and he feeds off of it. Hence the style of his book. Or lack thereof. His art is heartless. Can there be any debate about that? In college, the few people who liked Pynchon were all science fiction readers and, yes, heartless people. With a bone to pick. (Go outside and toss the ball, fellas. You'll perk up in no time.)"
3,help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was excited upon purchasing this book because of all the hype surrounding it, but soon found myself in well over my head. I was only able to get through the first 70 pages and despite concentrating had no clue to what was going on. I did have vivid dreams the nights I read the book, however, so on some level it was working on my subconsious state. I fail to see how this is considered a literary gem."
3,A very good 3 1/2 star book,"Yes, there's a lot of gravity here - dense, intense, tyrannical and demanding gravity. It does demand. There's nothing wrong with a little work though. Some of the reviewers here had to attempt this thing a few times before actually making it - myself included.It's a mountain and I the reader felt like a mountain climber, if you will, and when I got close to the top, even though I knew the view would not get any better I said to myself: I'll take the extra steps and finish this thing. Then I can say: I finished this thing. Was it worth it? For all the five star reasons, sure why not. There's gold in them hills.But, too often I felt frustration knowing I have enjoyed journeys far more user-friendly that had just as good a pay off."
4,Excellent,"Gravity's Rainbow was quite a journey for me. It took me a good amount of time to read, and at times it felt like work, rather than play. All told though, it was an enjoyable journey. Some of the passages are among the most jarring and beautifully written I have ever read. Several scenes had me laughing while turning the pages. It is incredibly complex and scattered, so I am going to admit up front that I will have to read it several more times to ultimately decide my thoughts on the matter. At first blush, however, I thought that V. (Pynchon's first novel) had a ""tighter"" story, one which I found more engaging. While I enjoyed the story and pacing of V. more, Gravity's Rainbow remains an excellent book.P.S. Pig Bodine is one of my favorite literary characters, and I was surprised and pleased to see him pop up in GR."
1,Incoherent.,The book is written in a train-of-thought style that keeps steering you away from the plot. The tangents Pynchon goes off on are not essential in the least. I'm convinced this book could be an interesting 100 page novel if all that excess verbage were excised.
4,"Huge, dense, strange, possibly rewarding","I picked this book up because I wanted a challenge after reading Joyce's Ulysses. Well, this is far weirder than Joyce's book. Gravity's Rainbow sprawls out page after page with a plethora of references to art, science, pop culture, and anything else that Pynchon felt like putting in, apparently. I plodded through the first 400 pages feeling quite amused by the extravagance of the language and the often dream-like quality of the scenes, but the main point eluded me. A more disciplined soul than I, with a real interest in difficult literature, could probably make sense of this book."
1,Offensive Trash,"An entire novel centered on the unrealistic, flimsy idea that a man getting erections will attract missiles? Some missiles may be heat seaking but the temperature of blood found in the groin during erections is no longer near the degree it takes to attract heat seaking weaponry. Get your facts right, Pynchon. A scientist you ain't. As for the books social commentary on a whole, I can say this: I have not read the book, but I watched the film, and to be blunt, I've seen better film on teeth. Pick up a classic Steven King novel like IT instead of this pretentious crud."
5,Hard to Define...,"This book is hard to define. I read it almost a year ago and I'm still trying to digest it. The writing is very entertaining and engaging at times; other times it is downright frustrating. I found it best to just keep plugging along without trying too hard to get at meaning (there may be none there). Part of me feels like there is something I missed in the book, but overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to those up to the challenge."
2,A magnificently written yet excruciatingly tedious book,"It's been said that there are two reasons to read literature:1. For the enjoyment of reading2. To say that you have read literatureIf you fall into the latter, then this book is for you. If you happen to fall into the first category, then there are a multitude of books other than Gravity's Rainbow which are more worthwhile to read. Throughout the majority of this novel, I found my attention wandering as I sludged my way through Pynchon's sublime yet mind numbingly unfathomable prose. To be fair, I wouldn't call Gravity's Rainbow a bad book. It is simply a chore rather than a joy to read. If you are interested in Pynchon I strongly recommend The Crying of Lot 49 or V over this."
3,Paganism and Christianity,The book actually wasn't what I was looking for. I bought one as a gift and ended up buying something else.
4,good for waveless days,"i got this game a few days ago, at first i couldnt believe how reelistic it was. i was very happy. but now i think its ok. theres not that much to the game but it is cool. my advise is wait untill it comes down in price"
1,ew...,eww............ who is going to buy this is going to be so mad. this is such a bad CD. i feel sorry for Hilary Duff.
1,Always read the fine print!!!,"I purchase this album for my grandaughter, thinking I had purchased Hillary Duff....how wrong I was...and how disappointed my grandaughter was!! This cd is really pathetic, and would make bad karaoke sound good!!!I only wish I had looked a little closer and realized this is in no way Hillary Duff, but someone trying to sing HER songs, and not doing a very good job at that. If Simon had heard even one of these songs, he would have cut her off at the knees!!!! Be careful what you buy...it is not always what it seems!!!!VERY unhappy in Ohio."
4,Box Set DVD,Got this used and it was in really good shape. Glad to get all in one set. Wanted this for along time. If anyone likes the Syi-Fy channel this is a must !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I never received it!,I want my money back. I ordered these a looooong time ago and haven't received them. I will not purchase from Amazon again.
1,Too much money!!!,"I love the Wild Thornberrys, but this game didn't do it justice. I bought it for my six-year old daughter and she didn't like it. Once you get into a stage, it doesn't let you out of it. Neither the start or select button can take you out of there. Maybe we should play around with it some more, but we got so frustrated we just switched over to the Tarzan game. Now that game is awesome! The Wild Thornberry game is too, too expensive. Save your money and with half the money you can get Tarzan---Now that's a game! It seems that Activision (made Tarzan and Spiderman) makes really great games. Sorry Mattel."
4,Totally Adorable,"My husband bought this game for my kids,who are six and four. I really thought it would be too much for them. They love it!As Goofy you explore several rooms in his Fun House for items in his movies. Although it is a little challenging for my kids to retrieve some of the items,once you retrieve them all, you can watch a full length Goofy cartoon. I love playing this game myself. It is a excellent game for the whole family to do together!"
1,Bad design!,"There's a problem with the design of this headset. The jack used is too short. It's EXTREMELY sensitive to movement. If you don't have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still, you'll loose the connection. I don't know why they designed it that way..."
2,Not an mp3,Not the best headphones...tinny and hollow sound...does ok...sounds like a cheap MP3 player even though it is the best phone in whole universe!
1,Palm Treo Pro Stereo Headset,Very disappointed as this headset doesn't actually fit the Palm Treo Pro as advertised. This has the smaller 2mm plug when the Palm Treo Pro requires the larger 3mm plug. This product is of no use to me !!!!!!!!!
5,c'est magnifique!,"This movie is so great, and also so watchable--the best!!!I was watching ""The Big Sleep"" and saw its influence on ""Rififi""?Also, the more modern ""7""?The rain, the weather, and yet the separateness, the automaton-ityesqueness of societe.Yes, I am a dork and I know nothing!Except this is a great movie--watch it as soon and as often as you can!"
3,"Good, but no masterpiece.","The legendary wordless heist is pretty good. The silence isn't driven by any need within the story for most of its duration, but it's cool nonetheless. The characters are well defined and the story plugs along well until the end with a final segment that doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all and seems stylistically out of place."
2,KID ROCK,No Kikd Rock Performence But Good Matches.When i Ordered It On PPV back In April It Was Awesome.Add Kid Rock In The DVD It Wud Be A 5
4,"Shoot To Thrill, just without much thrilling.","I was there live, yes live in Houston, Texas, live infront of 72,000 fans.To sum it up, it didn't feel to much like a WrestleMania, it felt more like Survivor Series or maybe a more hyped up Royal Rumble. Maybe it was the match quality or the actual matches.I enjoyed everything about WM 25 otherwise. John Cena's entrance was great as usual, and WWE please....please keep Big Show out of main events. Seeing Austin live was something good, and Shawn Micheals Vs UnderTaker was possibly the greatest match of all time.Randy Orton vs HHH was possibly the most boring match that I have ever experienced, even the crowd was dead.The quality of HD on the Blu Ray disc is ok, not 1080p, but definitely better than 480i or anything televised, plus you also get the HOF on Blu Ray, kinda boring to watch, it's one of those things that you gotta watch live to enjoy.If you are building a Wrestling collection, I would also add this DVD/Blu Ray to my collection."
3,Better then some....still tin can echo,"Purchased this for the mrs. Overall it performs well, but as a receiver of her calls with this headset, I do hear a tin can echo.She has been happy with it, saying it fits well, callers voice is clear, and she likes having the mic closer to her mouth."
4,vERY GOOD BUT A DIFFICULT READ,"Recommended but wuth some caution. The pluses include author is candid about his thoughts, raises some excllent points about using percent rather than dollar amounts. When testing use either market adaptive stops or percents to normalize. It is however a diifcult read....never managed to finish reading it cover to cover. I have large amounts of it on many occassions and do feel qualified to comment. I really liked his comments on TRADESTATION the so called industry standard...an overpriced and [very] ugly way of inflicting testing your methodology to come by !Now system writer that was one that really made a gargantuan difference to actual traders"
3,Useful but,remember: there is no such thing as a free lunch..you have to build systems yourself and test test test and then optimise a bit.(I said a bit :-)
3,Hard To Complain Yet Not a Matching Glow,"The bulbs just did not match my exepectations based on feedback. This light in our post lantern looks much more like a traditional bug light, it is very, very YELLOW, not amber as I was expecting. Disppaointed, should have only ordered one, I think I would prefer the dark amber to hopefully get some type of amber glow."
4,As I remembered,"If you like sappy, predictable, light hearted, holiday stories, then this is the perfect choice. Glad I added this to my collection of holiday movies to enjoy."
5,Borrowed Hearts,A family holiday movie for everyone. Shows you that loves happens when we least expect it . A must have for holiday movie collections.
5,Borrowed Hearts,Been watching this on TV for a few yrs & kept waiting for it to come out on DVD & it finally did. I just love this movie & enjoy watching it very much so :)
1,Didnt come with cd,I bought this DVD because I like watching this movie on TV and I thought why not just own it and also because it came with a Christmas music CD which I thought would be wonderful. But unfortunately it did not come with the CD which is very disappointing. I haven't watched it yet so I do not know if it is edited yet.
1,Unhappy with edited version,"Borrowed Hearts. The original version is a wonderful story, but they edited this version making it lose it's continuity and understanding, and have basically ruined it. We tried to return it to the seller, but they were rude and argumentative and now Amazon has started an investigation into this problem and hopefully we'll get our money back. If not, we will have wasted our money and will never order from this particular company again! They should be required to put, ""Edited For Children"", with their ad so adults would know not to buy the item."
5,Loved it alot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is our 2nd copy. We loaned out the first one and never got it back.Great family movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,fav,it is a good story it has to be one of my favorite movies to watch all year long not just christmas.
4,Not bad.,Good for linux admins that couldn't get kde documentation in some of the other books. Get this and a gnome book and you are ready to go.
1,not happy,Reasons :Too big for size. Keep slipping off my baby's foot & he's just 3 months old.Hardly make any rattling sounds.
2,Just O.K,My three months old likes the ones for the wrist - the socks won't stay on because there is no lycra... who knew?ADD LYCRA! SOCKS NEEDS TO BE STRETCH ON!
3,Cute,Adorable product. Cute concept. Nicely made. But my daughter didn't give a crap about them. If anything they only got in her way while she was trying to get her hands in her mouth.
3,wrist too short,my bb is 18 weeks and the velcro on the wrist band can just manage to meet at both ends on her wrist. Its not gonna be good for bigger babies. I hope my bb will enjoy touching her feet!
3,Great Idea but...,"the socks do not stay on my daughter's chubbilicious feet. At four months she has just started grabbing her little tootsies and these feet-finders are super cute but 1, aren't shaped like a sock to accommodate the heel and consequently come off rather easily and 2, are a bit tight (but dont seem to have any elasticity to them) and are hard to keep pulling back on my baby's feet."
1,Your little one doesn't need these,"With our first child, I bought these so our baby could have some stimulation when he was young. These are more entertainment for adults because the baby didn't really notice them because he had to wave his wrist directly in front of his eyes, which happens like once in a blue moon. Then you get paranoid that the little animals will fall off and land in your kids mouth."
3,Hard to rattle,"The rattles are cute but doesn't really serve their function to ""rattle"". The sound is really low and you have to kind of shake quite hard in order for the rattle sound to be heard. It's hard for newborn to shake their hands/feet to make it sound hard enough to interest them. When I put it on my newborn she wasn't even aware that they're there. At 12 week, my daughter is starting to gain more control of her hands and feet and awareness so I'm going to give it a try again but the foot rattle no longer fits her. They should really make it a bit bigger."
2,Didn't fit,"I bought this in October 2012 & was hoping for the set with black & white stripes, but received the set with green & yellow (first product picture). I got these when my son was 4.5 months old as that seemed to be when he was really noticing his feet & grabbing them & I thought this would be perfect. Unfortunately nothing fit, the wrist bands were too small & the socks went on okay but weren't elastic & just fell off. [However I should note my son's a big boy & weighed around 15 pounds at the time] Only 2 of the 4 bugs rattle & it was a very quiet rattle at that. I ended up returning the set.We also received theInfantino Foot Rattlesas a shower gift & these still snuggly fit him (at that time) & stayed on much better, both booties rattle but again it's quiet. I believe the infantino ones are only sized up to 3 months but they are a nice stretchy material. Walmart also has Garanimal ones that look nice {& a cheaper price point!} but we never tried them."
2,Poor sound and wrong material for feet,Out of the 4 rattles only 2 are rattles and the other 2 are just stuffed bugs. The rattlers are not noisy enought. My daughter doesn't even hear them herself while she moves her arms.The other issue is that the socks are not elastic enough and too big for ther feet. Just as she starts to move they will come off.My daughter was 4 month old when i bought this.
5,Gift,"This was part of a Christmas gift for my nephew. For him to shoot his sister, mother, and possibly the cat if he's quick enough and has got good aim. I imagine the cat would be harder to hit than his mom and sister, but I guess if he leads his shots he should get it down in time. I also got him some extra ammo so he doesn't have to reload as often."
4,Great gun for kids,My 8 year old nephew hasn't put this toy down! The darts glow quite brightly and the gun has good range for a nerf toy
3,Its OK,It is good but the trigger is in front instead of back and it's hard to hold. It is very bulky.
3,False Packaging,"The package on this product would indicate that the entire dart glows, but the glowing dart is a product of wrapping stiff decals around the dart and it is the decal that glows. This makes the dart less stable in flight and increases friction as the dart exits the chamber, reducing velocity and consistency in dart trajectory. That said, it is a decent toy and a nice complement to the Rev-6 model. It can be fired without the batteries, whose sole job it is to ""flash"" the chamber every three trigger pulls to ""charge the darts before flight. It is nice to find lost darts around the house by turning out the lights when the fight is over."
1,Get A Life!,"Go take care of your wife and maybe she would want to role play with you. Create your own love lust stories. Be a respectful, honest spouse and maybe your partner would happily be enough for you!!"
5,surprisingly effective and entertaining,"I consider myself a well-educated, articulate woman. I scored in the 98th percentile for the verbal portion of the GRE, and was an English major at university. So many vocabulary books/tapes seem to teach words that a)I already use, or b) are so arcane as to be useless. The Wordbuilders series was terrific and included vocabulary that I really wanted to learn. Besides that, it was refreshingly entertaining; great to listen to in the car. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Joey Heatherton,"This cd is lovely to look at but you may need to be a Joey fan to appreciate the music. This music is ""of it's time"" the 60's and 70's and over produced.Joey had a good voice but she would have been better served with simpler arrangements.The photos are beautiful."
2,OK,This was not the best book for a reference. I would like something that shows musculature and how exercises affect it.
5,Good stuff,I Love this Nutraspray melatonin natural orange 2fl. oz. I only use a half of a spray at night and im asleep in 5 minutes or less. If you take it when your not going to get 5-8 hours of sleep it will make you groggy in the morning. That's what it did to me anyways. But it actually worked. So give it a try.
5,Great knives,I love these knives! What a difference it makes in the kitchen when you have good tools! It makes cooking so much more pleasurable. I did alot of research on different brands and then my husband got me these for Christmas. I couldn't be happier.
3,snazzy,"Pretty snazzy set of knives, including the unique glass panel storage rack. Extra sharp high quality steel, comfortable handles, easy to use and clean. German steel made in Taiwan, non-stainable. My bread knife stained after the first use. Overall though, I'm happy to have them in my kitchen."
4,Super gift,Very nice knife set and looks nice on the counter. The knives are a good quality and should last a long time.
4,Charming,"My favourite Naipaul, though not his best work. He captures our dreams, our ability to create new realities from the mundane aspects of life. In linking song and prose he is able to tie the novel to a time in Trinidad's history. But, the themes are universal, love, money, and making a Way in the World. In those themes there will always be laughter and pathos."
1,What a poor design!,"I purchased two of these fans mainly for the color I needed. Within a few weeks I find out the globes were sagging. After tightening them again and trying not to break the globes,they still came loose and two globes fell and broke along with the bulb covers. And guess what! Westinghouse don't have replacement parts for the design failure that I believe is the problem. But of course it's been discontinued! If you don't use the fan, it just might work you! So much for buying a ceiling fan. And I suggest you don't sit directly under it. The vibration of the fan however so little, will loosen the globes and could fall upon you."
4,The beginning of a genius!,"Yes,this is the first album released by this guitar virtuose of Chicago electric blues school! An excellent job with great songs and perfectly guitar tunes! Really another gem,from the great Delmark Records,with visionary spirit of Bob Koester!"
3,"RATED E, BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE",I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HEED TO THE OTHER REVIEWS. MY 4 YO CANNOT EVEN PLAY. MY 7 YO HAS A VERY HARD TIME. ADULTS?? MAYBE A LITTLE BORING.
4,Lou the Artist,"This PBS video makes the case that Lou Reed is not just a guy who makes thrilling rock music. He is an Artist (with a capitol A) in the great modernist tradition who experiments with his life in order to test the limits. This sounds forbidding, but this documentary is fun and unpretentious and exhilarating."
1,Highly theoretical and inaccessible,"This book was assigned reading for a children's literature course. It is extremely dense, highly theoretical, and somewhat inaccessible. Unless fairy tales are your life and love, this is not your book. I don't know what the previous reviewer was thinking, but there is no 10 year old I know who would EVER be able to comprehend or indeed care about what Zipes argues in this book. This book would be excellent reading for a Fairy Tales Ph.D. candidate. (BTW, I am a college graduate in English and teacher of English for 13 years, so it's not that I am a disinterested or incapable reader)."
1,Ugh!!!,"This book is boring, hard to read, harder to understand. Not for a beginner. Bought this as a textbook for a class. The professor should have assigned another book. This was way too difficult. Makes you fall asleep!"
2,"Frustrating to build, great to display.","I must say this set was extremely frustrating to build. It is the least structurally sound Lego set I have ever built. Granted Lego was limited in what they could do because they were copying an existing design, but that is no excuse for the problems I had.First, attaching the cockpit area caused the lower wing to fall apart multiple times. Once I finally got that attached (after about 20 minutes) I built the upper wing and had to attach that one to. For the next 2 hours I sat there rebuilding the lower wing, cockpit and upper wing to get it attached right. Like I said, EXTREMELY frustrating. It took close to 4 hours to build when it should not have taken more than 2.After it was all built I think it looks great sitting on a shelf, where it will collect dust because if I dusted it, it would fall apart."
2,N-Secure,"While this was an ok film with a common run of the mill storyline; it could have been a whole lot better and entertaining had they allowed, maybe, Robi Reed to cast it for them as far as males in the film. Had the lead been Blair Underwood, who has the background for this part and would have made the lead character a more difficult, as well as interesting study...given HANDSOME, SOPHISTICATED, and wealthy; I would have watched it time and time again (a personal preference). Also the wardrobe of the male friend was not up to the standard of the overall attaire of the cast. It was tacky and unsophisticated and just did not fit. Will I watch it again, when someone who hasn't seen it might want to watch it......and to see if they agree with me. I probably would have waited to get it at a reduced price, had I known what I know now. I would give it 2 and 1/1 stars.LOL"
4,Interesting,"I'm from Memphis, so it was good to see familiar faces and places throughout the movie. The story line was better than what I expected. I believe it had a good plot, but I didn't quite like some of the delivery. But overall, it was pretty good."
3,Queensryche Soundtrack,"I was amazed in the hospital scene (after the girl was in the car crash with her daughter) in this movie to hear the opening parts of the ""Operation Mindcrime"" track from Queensryche. ""Dr Davis, telephone please. Dr Davis, telephone please. Dr. Blair Dr. Blair, Dr. J Hamilton Dr. J Hamilton . . . "" Did anybody else notice this? Bizarre!"
4,Satisfied,"I was pleasantly surprised that i was able to hook up my 2nd generation IPOD to this system without any problems. I used the USB port on the system to do this.The sound quality of the system is good for its price. The FM receiver is good and i don't hear any background noise. This system looks nice and sleek.The only complain i have is with its remote. Its not as sensitive as i would like. Sometimes i've to click the buttons twice.All in all, i would say its a good system for the price.Philips MCM275 Flat Wall-Mountable Shelf System"
5,Amazing CD with beautiful singing and great choice of songs!,This CD contains beautiful singing and excellent choice of songs and instruments. The artist chose a collection of the most beautiful lullaby songs from different cultures. I highly recommend it to any new parents! It is definitely going to be a favorite baby shower gift item. The CD is amazing!
5,compliments,"i can not tell you how many times i have had people ask me what perfume i am wearing, saying how much they like it.it is the only scent i now wear, usually picking up a couple of bottles whenever i get to Ireland."
2,Good for level one HS German,"I was very disappointed with the number of cards and the lack of articles (m, f, n) and formation of plurals.The cards may be good for a very basic level of High School German but not beyond that. I admit that I did not check for the number of cards, but I was not ready for the number of repetitions. 1100 questions and answers? Well, maybe, three per card on each side, but how many times can you count ""danke"" and ""bitte?"""
4,Imaginative History,"Most history books are written in a monotone voice and many of them are also white-washed. But this book is very different from normal history because it sparks the mind for new thoughts and new possibilities, or what could have happened.This book is pretty amazing from the story of what could happen to the Mayflower to other unimagineable things that could pop up into the mind. I liked this book very much, but the only downside is that sometimes the essays and stories get a bit dull at times."
2,Kind of Disappointed,"I truthfully wanted to enjoy this book. I really did. After reading this book, I now believe that there's very little point in analyzing what didn't happen as opposed to what did. It also seems like any historian can make up any silly hypothetical situation and write about it. For instance, the first chapter about how things would be different if the wind blew the Mayflower in a different direction. Well, sure, I don't think you can argue against that. What if aliens came down and gave President Truman the technology to develop the nude bomb? It seemed to me like that would have been just as valid of an essay to read.Maybe I'm not being fair. There are some essays on key moments in American history, such as what if JFK wasn't shot. Unfortunately for me, I found the essays about the key moments in American history to be boring. And I love reading about history.Other people here seemed to have loved this book, so I may be wrong."
3,"Showed up damaged, very hard to clean","This is no reflection on the actual board itself, but it did show up damaged (one side was bent, causing the bottom corner to bow out from the wall after it was hung. I ended up taking it down, bending it back into place by hand, and it seemed to fix it without any major issues.My complaint with this board though is that it's very hard to keep clean. Using name-brand markers and erasers, you practically have to scrub the get the dry-ease off of there. And even then, ghosting is left on the board until you get out the board cleaner and paper towels to clean if off. I know it's not a porcelain board (which is what I'll buy next time), but still, I've never even had an issue with a melamine board being this hard to clean. I'd avoid if you can afford to..."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with my purchase. The white board came broken complete large section on the rightside facing the board. I had to return it. This will not keep me from purchasing other items in the future.
3,Disappointed in Book!,"Dear reader: This book might be funny and informative, but it is not what I had envisioned. I had just finished reading ""Blood Oath"" (by Christopher Farnsworth) about a fictional story - being the Presidents Vampire. When I saw this book on the Amazon website, I thought that the book was kinda of an exaggerated version of the Farnsworth book. This is actually about quirky and mysterious things that have happened through the ages. So, to make a long sentence even shorter - I didn't finish this book, and maybe you might feel different from me, but I didn't enjoy the writing and found it boring. This book is good for individuals that are interested in weird happenings. P.S. If you want to read a exciting book about supernatural vampires, definitely read Blood Oath. It is great!!!"
2,No 'Pop',"While you could tell this book was meticulously and intellectually 'Pop'researched, the writing and stories themselves failed to 'pop' for me."
4,Solid bar. Not Olympic quality,I bought this as an extra bar for my home gym. I have a Hammer Strength bench with a true Olympic Bar. This thing is a bit lighter. It will work great for 95% of the people out there.Those doing very heavy squats and deadlifts I advice spending the extra money for a higher end bar. All in all absolutely a great bar at a great price for the normal home gym.
5,Loved by my 8yrs old son,"I bought this game for my 8yr old son, he has some pokemon games too but he finds it the most funny and interesting game out of all. He spends a lot of his time with this game at gameboy color and I am ok with that since it is not another killing/shooting kind of violent game. If you buy this game or any game boy color I will highly recommand to buy a magnifier w/light to save his eyes, this is just a thoughtful advice from one who cares."
2,I couldn't get past 1st level,"I couldn't get past the first level of this game, I didn't know what I was supposed to do. You get into this Spider's web thing and it doesn't let you out. If I knew the object of the game I'd be able to but I couldn't. Could someone please help me with advise. Thanks."
3,can't pass level 1,"Hi,i and all my friends had the same problem, no one know how to defeat the spider. I can't help you either. How can we solve this, because there are no cheats or codes or usefull reviews available on nintendo.com or gameboy.com This is quite silly, we are from Holland"
3,cool,This was a cool game and it has lots of levels. Its not the best game in the world but it would be a really great gift for someone you love.
4,An essential addition to your West Side Blues Collection,"Jimmy Dawkins was not the first, but he was and is one of the very best West Side (of Chicago) blues guitarists. This is his first album, and it features some killer guitar work along with some somber singing in that classic minor-key West Side sound.Highly recommended."
3,Way to expensive,"The trouble with Garmin it charges way to much for all of its add ons. If you were buying this for a cheap radio you could buy it in the dollar store, but because of the interface you have to buy from them."
4,More Miles per Gallon,"Not to bad, got one for my son and my father in law for christmas. They both said they got 2 to 3 more miles per gallon."
3,Good Sound -Short Length,"I picked up several of these when we were cleaning out grandma's apartment. The production values seem to be reasonable, and the sound is crisp, clear and well managed in its balance between the highs and lows. Its a nice snappy album, but the CD barely tops 30 minutes, making it only desireable based on the price you have to pay for it. I suspect there are much better values out there in terms of content versus price."
1,Worth on par with paperweight!,"I'm really stunted by people who rates it highly. I read it back to back in one night. Try harder for one week to get usefull info. Nothing.IF you lived in my country, I'm more than willing to dig it from trash box in the garage and send it to you - free.For newbie, you can get higher rev RPM by crankin' up your printer - and print the man page & how-to."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,I RECENTLY GOT A TRAXXAS STAMPEDE XL-5 AND HAVE HAD IT FOR 2 WEEKS. IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME I HAVE GONE THROUGH FOUR OF THESE PEICES OF CRAP. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOTOR. A MOTOR THAT I SUGGEST IS THE VENOM FIREBALL 15X2 MOTOR.
3,Fast but fragile.......,"Dramatic increase of speed compared to old stock traxxas 20 turn motor, [Stinger]. I put 1 in a traxxas Blast boat, stampede, and rustler truck with XL-5 speed control. Pretty fun. Make sure you gear your rc to where you don't burn it up. Pinion to spur ratio. Quick burn up on overheat. If you can't touch the motor for more than 2 seconds without burning yourself, its too hot."
4,Just what I needed,"This is the second replacement bulb I've bought for my Himalayan salt lamp. When I opened the little box, I groaned. I didn't think the bulb would fit in the little hole that accommodates the socket but it did. It works with the dimmer, too. The first bulb replacement was too small to heat up the salt and didn't last long at all. It would be nice if this bulb would last a long, long time because it IS rather pricey."
3,Screws,Where are the screws and what are they called? I cannot seem to find them. As of now I'm not satisfied with my product
5,Great Stand for the Price. Stable,"This stand is a lot more stable than the people here seem to be saying it is. It is important to make sure to tighten the bolts as much as possible to avoid any wobble. I have not experience the bolts coming loose yet as I don't move the stand much. If you're going to use this stand for a keyboard you plan to keep at home and not move around much, just make sure to tighten the bolts and you're good to go."
5,Exceeds expectations,"I have already had a single x keyboard stand in the past. My prior experiences with single x keyboard stands were that they were very wobbly and overall didn't feel very solid. The pros of the single x keyboard stand is that they have always been the absolute cheapest options for keyboard stands. Keeping this in mind you could understand why I had such low hopes for this product.This keyboard stand is much better constructed and feels like it could support much more than a standard keyboard. The assembly was beyond easy, just screw in 4 bolts and you are ready to play.I must say that I bought this stand because it was cheap and offered Amazon prime shipping. I fully intended to upgrade later when my funds allowed me too, This stand has exceeded expectations so much that I have no plans of ever upgrading.This keyboard stand will more than suffice for home use, don't hesitate to pick 1 up!"
3,Fair enough for the price,"The keyboard still slides while playing at times, otherwise it's perfect it is the right height for me and is sturdy otherwise."
4,Exellent Service,I have been with nextel for nearly a year now I started out this time last year with the Motorola i205 and just upgraded to the i265 it is one of the best phones I have ever had the service is the best I have ever had I have no problems making or reciving calls. If you are considering nextel give it a shot they are in my opinion the best cell company out there.
2,canidae dry dog food,"My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though."
1,Not yet received,"The book has not yet reached me, even 1 month after ordering it.Had ordered for the 1st time on Amazon...Extremely disappointed."
1,I suppose I am in the minority on this?,"I loved Talion Revenant, and know people who are also absolutely in love with his Star Wars series. This all just led me to be even more disappointed after suffering through A Hero Born. It certainly had some interesting ideas there, but it was really distractingly cheesy! But give it a read if you think you'll find otherwise, this author clearly is very talented despite my thoughts on this one book."
5,Tragic Loss,"I have searched for years, and to my disappointment, Mon Cherie Hazelnut Chocolates were no more. Never has a chocolate melt in my mouth quite like this one. I was truly saddened to discover that it was no longer being made. I hope the company will reconsider."
3,"Very expensive, about 10% failure rate","What's to review? Most worked. 2 out of 20 did not. Haven't used the other 30 yet. For the money paid, I would expect all of them to work!!!"
3,Car for the Gods,"I am a Lamborghini owner so I have researched every possible factabout the car. Not because i plan on selling or replacing parts forworn ones, but for the fact that this car is truly a mark ofexcellence in the super car genre. I've read many books and this oneis about a five when compared to all the others. It gives facts butits mainly for the beginner lamborghini ethusiasts, not those that hasindepth details on the cars. As anyone Lambo ethusiasts knows, itshard to find Accurate stats on the car's performance numbers, but thisbook has all of its facts and numbers correct. For the guy at thetop,..that little four door that dodge produced for lamborghini is nota ""True lamborghini"" , go to this sight and have your eyesblown from there sockets from cars your eyes wouldn't believe."
2,expansionism doesn't ask nicely,"This book contained a lot of informative statistics, but I felt that the implied thesis was that expansionism, imperialism and other forms of colonization are always bad and that nobody asked the countries conquered if they wanted to be conquered. The selection of quotes seemed bias and out of context (especially the quotes drawn from Mark Twain)."
3,Wake Tower Speaker,"This speaker pair is a fair value. The speakers that shipped with the pair are very low quality. I replaced them with a pair of high quality JL Audio speakers and they sound great. The Mounting Brackets are made from plastic, and do not hold up well in the wakeboard enviornment. My tower is 1-3/4"" so the brackets do not work very well. Both of them broke in the middle where the bracket makes contact with the tower because of the pressure placed on those mounting points. I phoned the manufacturer and they did replace them no charge. I have since taken a thick piece of rubber to use inside the clamp and the bracket to make the mounting point of the tower 2-1/2 inches. This way it has even clamping power around the entire tube. I think the manufacturer knows there is an issue because the speakers ship with a safety wire."
3,Used for a rhino not a boat,I bought these and used them in my rhino for off roading in the dunes and just cruising through the desert. I am writing this review 2 years later I bought them dec of 09 its now dec of 11. They are good speakers I could hear them very clear with a few audio adjustments to the deck. They had good bass when needed and treble. If your looking for a quick $100 speaker set and dont wanna spend $500-$1000 on other rhino audio set ups these arent bad. The only bad thing that happened to them was the mounting brackets snapped after 2 years. The sand and vibration got the best of these though. They are pretty much shot now but for $100 for 2 years that aint bad. Now i am actually gunna order the 8in 300watt ones to install into the rhino.
2,No Air,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase 4 of these items. When I received them, the first one I opened and examined, had the same lack of air flow as another person's review had stated! I then proceeded to check the other three and found the same problem - all four are missing the air ports on the ""spool"" section! The other thing I am not too happy about is the air swivel is held together with o-rings instead of metal snap-rings, I guess you get what you pay for, lucky for me they were going in my machine shop, I have a new project now!"
4,My 6 month old daughter loves this book!,"My 6 month old enjoys turning the pages on her own and looking at the pictures in this book. We can sit her on the floor and she'll spend 15 minutes studying the pictures as she turns the pages. I like the book because it exposes her to art, and because it's got a cute story and rhyme to it. I plan on buying more books from this series."
3,Having coffee with Joan,"That's what this book will feel like to you: surely you must be sitting in your favorite coffeeshop across from Joan Borysenko, bending heads over a couple of Cafe Mochas! Joan tells it like it is, but with compassion, and a relation to what happened to her. I've had suspicions about the source of guilt in my life, but Joan's stories were the push to clarity. Years of talk therapy coalesced for me with this book. I had the good fortune to meet Joan once. Her energy is so friendly; you'll swear you've known her all her life. Thank the Source for inspiring this woman to teach us!"
1,Great-But a TEARJERKER!!!!!!!,"This book is one of the best ever so far. Its filled with emotion, love, and courage. Jess and Christian really love each other and then what a drastic ending! I was like OH MY GOSH!!!!! I cried at the end so hard when she said I won this for Christian the bravest man I ever knew. It showed how much she truly loved him. This is one of Kate's best yet, but what a TEARJERKER!!!!"
3,Caveat lector!,"I, too, read Nick Tosches' article in Vanity Fair. Since I am ""from the Sixties,"" as James Earl Jones says in ""Field of Dreams,"" I was part of the natural audience for a story like this.When I looked up the book in Amazon, I bought it quickly, figuring all along that it would be an expansion of the magazine article. 'fraid not. It's just a $10 version (Kindle) of the article I read for nothing at Vanity Fair's website.I should never assume anything when it has to do with writers. I should know. I are one, tho nowhere near as compelling as Tosches can be.I really wish he HAD written a longer book. I was along for the ride, wherever it went. He recommends a more comprehensive book on the subject. I imagine I'll see if I can find it, tho Tosches says it's not for sale in the USA.Just a warning: This is a short ride. Intense, but very brief."
1,The scrubber I received is nothing like the one I ordered,"The brush I received is blue and white, and most importantly does not have the scrubbies on the edges as shown. The brush I received is dollar store quality. I am very disappointed."
2,high handicapper ball,"This is a decent golf ball if you're a beginning player and you want inexpensive balls but a mid or low handicap player will probably be disappointed. They are not long, the spin factor seems very low, and the ball just sort of feels dead or heavy coming off the clubface. I'm a 12 HCP player with just enough ability to tell a good ball from a mediocre ball. The Fuzz isn't a good one, but it is worth the price if you're not a serious golfer with average or better ability."
4,Good Show,I like watching shows that were on in the 80's and 90's so much better than whats on tv today. It has it quirkiness but that is the charm of the show.
1,Thank God it was cancelled,"Most annoying show ever. Navel-gazing to the extreme. Humans have been raising children for millenia, but somehow it was tougher in the eighties. Well boo hoo."
1,Way of Zen,This book was received poorly collated: pages missing and in wrong order. I was very disappointed and have requested a refund.
2,Performance nowhere near expectations,"Not sure what the other positive reviewers consider good or strong coffee, or what procedures they used. I tried this device several times, and see the problem as basically not having the coffee grounds getting sufficiently wet during brewing. The tight plastic mesh allows very little water to get into the device during microwaving, and thus very little coffee gets actually brewed. The emptied coffee grounds come out partly dry after ""brewing"". I tried different heating times, and also pre-wetting the coffee - messy and impractical. Fortunately not too much money spent on this."
1,GREAT MOVIE - DVD DOES NOT WORK,"I loved the movie when I went to see it back when. THE DVD DOES NOT WORK. I tried 6 times it started with ""loading DVI"" then it says ""REGION ERROR"" and locks up.Good Movie BAD DVD"
3,A decent film.,"Overall this is a decent film. Compared to the book, the film is definitely intended to evoke more sympathy for the Jewish plight in Europe after WWII, considering it focuses almost entirely on the DP camps in Cyprus, whereas the book devotes equal attention to the DP camps and the actual political and military maneuvering involved in building the state of Israel. One note definitely in favor of the film is that it's depection of the Exodus incident follows the historical facts a little bit more accurately. All in all, still a pretty good film, glad I bought it."
3,Great Movie but poor transfer to DVD,"The movie itself is what I expected, having seen it before. It is a captivating epic motion picture faithful to the book by Leon Uris.Sadly, the transfer to DVD was done on the cheap. Occasional artifacts from the worn master film are evident. And while it is a ""Widescreen"" format, it is not Anamorphic or ""Enahanced for 16x9 TVs"". This means that if you have a wide-screen TV, the picture needs to be viewed is zoomed 4X3 mode to fill the screen. This lowers the resolution of an already poor copy.In sum, buy it for the story but don't expect a vivid viweing experience for your home theater system."
2,WORSE TRANSFER EVER!!!!,I wont even go into the story line or the actors roles. I want to ..I have to tell everybody about the transfer to DVD of this classic movie. The picture looks like a bad VHS copy done by an amatuer! The sound.....oh my God the sound is absolutely horrible! I watched this on my Sony 36 inch tv and I immediately cleaned my DVD player thinking there was something wrong with it! I adjusted the sound on my Sony ES (Professional Grade) Reciever several times and into several modes from Mono to Theatre EX to basic stereo and nothing would improve it. MGM be ashamed!! LOUIS B MAYER is rolling over in his grave!!!
4,looks just like the middle east today!!,"This is historically close to history, a nice way to teach how things transpired in the Land of Israel via a drama that promises to keep you interested!! And notice the way it reminds you of the CURRENT Peace Process (and the future resolution to it??). Nice. No bad language, no nudity, safe."
4,Good meat slicer,Good for firm meats like ham; not so easy to use for roast beef. Wouldn't recommend for cheese - which would overheat the motor.
4,great inexpensive boots,"Purchased for my 89 year old father in a nursing home who has Parkinson's and poor circulation resulting in severe venous ulcers and lower extremety swelling. No shoes were big enough. Had to modify the boots by slipping 1"" foam between outer layer and fleece to give the boots some structure and prevent them tripping him....he is unstable enough as it is.One of the tags is memory foam...there is no foam in the boots except the stuff that I put in. The sides are floppy and there is fleece cushioning the sole."
4,An Acquired Taste,"An Acquired Taste-- If you will give these a try for a week or two, perhaps, substituting for a package of peanuts (they are about the calories of peanuts), you may be pleasantly surprised at how they satisfy your appetite, especially in the late afternoon an hour or two before dinner - I have found by enjoying these about an hour and a half before dinner I will be satisfied with a smaller dinner serving.Chew them slowing and one or two at a time as they may seem to be a bit on the dry side. Order the other favors too of the ""round"" variety. I found the bars to be a bit over-baked in the centers; but, the rounds seem just fine.While you can certainly eat fresh cheese and enjoy the benefits, these packages are just right size for a person on the go and they don't need refrigeration. Give them a try and perhaps you'll acquire a taste for them!-"
4,Pax!,"Although Jim Hightower doesn't document as well as some, this same information has been well and thoroughly itemized and documented elsewhere. And, although his is not the best book on the subject, Hightower is indeed correct: we, the people, have lost control of our own country. Remember ""Of the people, by the people, FOR the people?"" We would do well to pay attention before it's too late.However, in reading the reviews on Amazon, which I generally find quite helpful, I have noticed an odd thing. So many Righties, Bushies, Conservatives (sorry, I don't know what they are calling themselves these days) apparently become sputteringly incoherent with rage upon reading (or, in some cases, obviously NOT reading) something they disagree with. They attack like enraged and starving Yahoos in hilariously illiterate, fortunately short, and usually vulgar little outpourings of spleen. I mean, really, is this necessary?"
4,Gin Blossoms Raw and Rough,"Sometimes raw and rough just means poor production or lousy musicianship. Not in this case. This early Gin Blossom disc is certainly less polished then New Miserable Experience (which contains 4 ""Dusted"" tracks) but it is raw and rough in a good way. To me, this cd has a much more country feel to it. Alt/Country that is. The guitars remind me alot of early Old 97's. One track, ""I can't sleep"" sounds like it could have belonged on the Long Ryders first record. I think if the band had gone in this direction rather than the sound of ""Congradulations, I'm Sorry"" then they would have been right in the Alt/Country discussion. If you like the Gin Blossoms and you are a fan of Alt/Country then pick it up. You will not be disappointed."
1,Another Disappointing CD from the Hypnosis Network,"This is the second purchase that I made from the Hypnosis Network. I thought that I received a ""bad apple"" in the bunch.So, I was willing to give HN aother try. However, to my same disappointment, the product was sorely lacking in technique. Ifound the material and delivery very ineffective.Once again, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Good Stuff!,"I first caught some of this series on Sci-Fi channel, during their October month long fear-fest. I was only able to watch about an hour of it before I had to leave for work, but it intrigued me, so I went on a hunt to rent it. No one had it in stock anymore, so I ended up buying it. Woohoo! It's a crazy little series that is definitely Stephen King. I like pretty much every single King production, even if most of the actors are no-names. They usually do a great job of bringing the creepy element into the scenes. This series is sufficiently creepy and strange, with lots of crazy characters. The behind the scenes is cool too, getting to see what it was like to film such a huge project. I enjoyed it very much, watched it all in one weekend, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of King's movies like Storm of the Century... really LONG movies!"
5,Gift,I gave this as a gift to my father for christmas. He has an almost complete collection of Doctor Who. It came in great condition and he's very happy with it.
3,Works only on some micro SD cards,"The reader doesn't work for Kingston micro SD cards larger than 1 GB, probably not for other brands as well. The manufacturer wasn't aware of this, and said that they would try to get me a software update to enable reading 2GB Kingston cards, but several weeks have gone by and nothing yet. :("
4,Share the project with a child,Easy and fun project to do with the child for whom you made this purchase. I think it would be a great idea for a child's party project. The price is reasonable enough to provide each child with a kit.
1,$10 Rental for 24 Hours,Amazon must be employing some really idiotic salespeople....$10 rental and $14 purchase.....Come on...Get a grip on life!This is the most absurd rental price I have ever seen shown for a show...
3,Innocuous,"I think the general flavor of these reviews captures this small production accurately. If you are the kind of person who believes a reference to a favorite movie in another film makes that second film inherently worth viewing, then this is for you. Do you enjoy shouting aloud, ""Ha! See that? They're referencing the scene in Bride of Frankenstein when Elsa Lanchester....""? If that's you, you'll be enchanted, because they invoke every old horror movie I've ever seen.If, however, you want a film with something original, something not wretchedly PC, and something witty and clever, then I'm afraid you must go elsewhere. This is not vile, and was visually well done, and my 11 year old grandson was amused. But slight, predictable, and ever so gentle, this film genuflects at every PC altar and ignores any where quality or originality is held up."
1,Don't bother...!,"This animation was very disappointing and totally disturbing for adults and children alike. I found nothing funny or entertaining about it. While the animation may have been well done to some degree, the plot, characters and actions in the film are scary, and not in the good sense of the word either. I purchased the DVD expecting greatness (which is found in successfully animated films such as Monsters, Inc., The Incredibles, and Toy Story, etc.) gave it the benefit of the doubt while I squirmed in my seat, but halfway through; bored and disgusted, I just threw it in the trash. The movie is pathetic and fails miserably as entertainment. I could find no redeeming features. I couldn't even bring myself to give the DVD away (free) to anyone I knew! It would be too painful and I would make no friends in doing so. Don't bother buying it. It is not worth the viewing, time, or money."
5,Smart. Funny. Heart-warming,"I fell in love with this film, but importantly...my kids loved it. One of the most entertaining animated films I have seen in a LONG time!"
4,Most people won't need this,"Just an FYI if you are looking to purchase this item: most dishwashers made in the past few years will fit directly onto most InSinkErator disposals. I have a ~ 1 year old Frigidaire that connected securely without the need of this kit. If you are replacing a disposer, you can almost certainly re-use the existing dishwasher connector. Having said all of this, if you are doing a new install with a dishwasher, and the dishwasher has a smaller drain hose, this is the perfect solution and well worth the price."
5,I have searched for this all over,"I love this lotion. It is my very favorite; not greasy, smells wonderful, not irritating to sensitive skin. I use it for everything! I have bought it for years until recently it disappeared from stores. So I am overjoyed to find it for sale here."
4,A guilty pleasure season 2 but lacking DVD package,"A guilty pleasure show to watch on E!. Aired spring of 2008.Season 2.Well, we get more episodes in the 2cd season. The 1 that will tug at the heart strings is the last episode when they go to New Orleans & help a family out who lost their home in the 2005 Katrina storm.No special extras. A few deleted scenes & a video segment with Rob.Now, here are the problems with it 1. EPISODES ARE NOT UNCUT. Come on. The Girls Next Door DVD's are uncut they have nudity & language. Why is this show NOT shown uncut? I am very disappointed in that. 2. This HORRIBLE & CHEAP DVD case/holder. It has intentional HOLES IN IT ON BOTH FRONT & BACK Cheap, stupid & THOUGHTLESS 3. No commentary as well on the episodesAt lease it does have a chapter/episode list. BUT, the 1st season DVD said the original air dates for the episodes Season 2 does NOTLet us hope the DVD for season 3 is better than this"
3,Kim and kompany.......,This klan hit a slump this season...not that season one was oscar winning material but it was entertaining.
5,Great for the families of female Muslim converts,"This is a great book for families that are dealing with the hardships of a relative converting to Islam. Because of misconceptions about Islam, the conversion process can be diffucult, especially for those who think that Islam in practice is like the film, Not Without My Daughter. It gives a glimpse into the lives of Muslim female converts who are rendered silent by the media. They speak for themselves and articulate the choice to make Islam a part of their lives."
2,"Good Adaptation....poor music,annoying scenes","My husband and I watched this movie, and felt we had waisted our money. Pride and Prejudice FAR outweighs this one.First of all, the music in this movie we found to be barely tolerable.Secondly, In my opinion, the foul language could have been left out of this movie. Making it a bit more family friendly. Thirdly, We did watch it till the end, but it was a drudgery.I have read the book and will say that they perhaps did the best they could at putting this book on screen as it would be a difficult screen play to write. But some liberties were taken in the movie that I didn't like.Overall, it was a waste of time and money.On the other hand, Pride and Prejudice,Persuasion, and Jane Austen's Emma are excellent movies on which to spend your valuable time and money."
1,Depressing to no end,"I have never read this book, but bought it based on other movies I enjoyed that BBC has done. If you like Charles Dickens, you might enjoy this, but if you are looking for anything lighthearted or romantic you will be disappointed. Nothing like Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters which I enjoyed very much. Although I am sure that this is a literary masterpiece, it is depressing (as many literary masterpieces are). This is not an all around bad movie, just a bad match for me."
1,Could Not Sit Through This,"I was excited to sit down and watch this, but sadly could not get through more than a couple episodes. Natasha Little is a great Becky Sharp, and the costumes are lovely, but the adaptation is performed as a melodrama, exaggerating everything-- especially everything disgusting. Most of the characters are disgusting, so most of the time viewing the show was unpleasant. The music was a bit melodramatic as well. I hope I never have to listen to it again."
4,Get your classic fill. Quite enjoyable.,"Pretty good rendition of the classic. Dobbin is superb, and many actors are wonderful in this series.Beware of absolutely stinky music. Couldn't be worse, really. Well, maybe it's a toss between this one and soundtrack in the ""Invincible"".Other than that, definitely watch it. Beats Reese Whitherspoon's mockery any day."
3,Not all crazy over it.,"Doesn't look as nice as the package (like most things) but it's something different. It's a fun idea but this is one of those pieces that may be just that, a fun idea. It's of ""ok"" quality as anything from leg avenue is more of a novelty type item. It is made of 100% nylon, and made in Taiwan. I can't see it lasting for more than a few uses before it snags or rips which is unfortunate. It's also ""One Size"" where you should usually be a little weary about things like that. The bottom part of the body stocking was fine, but the top part to cover the torso, could be a little short if you have a longer torso. I rate this 3 stars, it'll be fun while it lasts, but it's of average, at best, quality. And yes, it is crotchless which is not noted anywhere. The company that it is sold from (fenvy), i have emailed them and they have never responded. They won't get anymore of my business either through amazon or directly."
2,Sad day when I tried it on,Twas Smaller then this model. I'm a small woman. 5'3 and it didn't fit. I opened it up and put it on to find a run :( Probably when they put the little cardboard in it. I can't model with it. Its only going to be used for the boyfriend. And I was really excited to use it for modelling too!But the fabric was amazingly soft and looked nice otherwise!
3,Fun for Halloweentown fans but change in cast a disappointment.,"Return to Halloweentown is an enjoyable movie for the kids that have been following the Halloweentown series. A change in the casting of the main character, however, is disappointing and a bit disjointed. It has been fun to see the children grow into young adults, and the storyline is enjoyable."
5,Great movies!,"I ordered the whole series of Halloweentown movies for my granddaughter for her 12th birthday. She is ecstatic and has played them over and over since she got them. The delivery was faster than advertised. Thank you, Amazon, for your super service!!"
3,Fun for the entire Family,"So nice to have a fun Halloween movie that will not create nightmares, but laughs."
4,Well Played,"This is a wildly alive and comic novel of the AIDS crisis. In the late 70s young writer Harley Mims moves to New York City and promptly falls into a deep friendship with Angie, a raucous talented painter, and Robert, a gifted composer as well as ""the most beautiful man in town"". The novel lovingly chronicles the highs and lows of this trio as they f*ck, frolic, and establish themselves as artists - oblivious to the specter of AIDS looming on the horizon. As the pandemic slowly surfaces we see a culture decimated by disease, but in the face of panic and death the virus only serves to strengthen the forces of friendship and intimacy among the group. This bond carries over into the care giving and making peace process, which became the adopted lifestyle of a generation. Funny, sexy, smart, and thoroughly rewarding, this is a novel to make you laugh; cry, and most importantly appreciate the awesome and immortal force of friendship"
4,Very Cute!,"Loved this product except I was expecting a wall decal and when I opened the package it was like a disposable tablecloth. I was very disappointed at first but once I, very easily, put it up (by myself while holding my 1 year old daughter) I was happy."
1,Two Panasonic Lemon's in a row,"Panasonic TH-50PX75U 50"" 720p Plasma HDTVI got this Plasma as a replacement from Circuit City for my first Panasonic 50"" plasma TV that I paid $3200 for. The previous plasma's HDMI input went bad after 1 1/2 years. I have had this new TV for just 6 months and now the same thing has happened to this one. The screen just went green when using HDMI. It took 6 weeks and a lot of hassle to get the first replacement from Circuit City. One of the clerks there told me you have to complain for a month before they will replace the TV."
4,Edgy,Definitely has the dark side expected - but handled quite well. Channing Tatum is an excellent choice for the star of this movie - it is different - haunting and worth watching.
1,gave it away,"unfortunately, this movie would not play in either my dvd player nor my sister's. I think it must have been foreign imported and programmed for the European market. Because I bought it used, it wasn't worth trying to return."
2,Not as good as sounded,"Storyline sounded good and Tatum Channing is an enjoyable actor. However, after seeing the movie, I was just ready for it to end. Just not enough to keep your attention."
3,Waste of good actors. Weak plot.,"Very weak plot and disappointing ending. I watched it because of Al Pacino. He was very good as were the other actors. Unfortunately, the story really went no where and I kept waiting for a bombshell hidden agenda plot. Never happened.White kid from the projects kills 2 worthless pathetic men. Al investigates and covers it up since he was the former partner of the kid's cop father who was deceased. Kid grows up to be cop. Past comes back to haunt them. A few more peeps die, the end.It really had so much more potential. I rate if Fair if you can't find anything else to watch."
2,these feel like a $14.00 shoe...poor,these are awful and I have returned them. Not only do the size 8's feel like a size 7 but they feel exactly like the price I paid for them.Don't bother!
4,UK DVDs,"I want to see this video since I didn't see it the first time. I will buy it even though it is formatted for UK DVD. That is not a problem. You can still play it in your PC whether laptop or desktop. I have played several UK DVDs that way, even one from Germany (it wasn't a PAL format). You simply can play several then have to play a USA DVD so the player doesn't do a permanent switch to UK region."
1,Industrial Metal Record of the year,"After the success of ""01"" with their harder than Minsitry sound. Testify inlisted the help of Metal Blade Artist Skrew to produce this followup which proved to be the most powerful and diverse Metal Industrial record of the year!"
2,Crooked label makes it 3+ degrees inaccurate,"I just received this thermometer from Amazon. My wife and I were impressed with the NSF certification and the HACCP guidelines the thermometer was to follow. However, I have no idea how it can pass such guidelines with any confidence, as the unit we received has the label cocked just shy of 10 degrees counter-clockwise, making the degree reading off by about 3-4 degrees of temperature.The unit is a solid steel unit with no ability to adjust anything. However, if you thought this was to be one of the more precise units, you will be sorely mistaken. Even if I put up with the wildly crooked label, I can't calibrate it for the actual temperature, so I'm left not knowing if the unit came calibrated and the factory had to twist the label, or if the unit would be calibrated if only the label was straightened.It's made in China by a French company. Maybe that says it all."
3,A Great All-Inclusive Work on the Seattle Music World,"When my cousin ..., told me of this book, I was all excited with anticipation... waiting to read up on all the bands and musicians I knew when I was part of the PNW music scene in the 60's.. ('63 to '67 with the Regents out of Tacoma). Well, there was some disappointment, and some satisfaction. The treatment of the ""Golden Era"" (50's & 60's) of PNW rock was prettly slim, yet still well presented. The 10 or so pages dealing with the ""Golden Era"" satisfied me, and the remaining 200 or so pages satisfied my daughter. If you are in to the more recent events of Seattle area music in the 80's and 90's, this is the book to get. Sammy Carlson... Bassist, The Regents '63-'67."
5,Great idea and great quality.,"I have an Xlarge dog with too much energy. Dog whisperer said to put a pack on your dog during walks that you can add water bottles to; the dog has to focus and concentrate as well as carry added weight. The pack fits perfectly and it is so convenient when we go walking, biking, hiking; he carries our water, his dish and my cell! I no longer have to pre-plan clothes with pockets or carry a pack of my own. He was 7yrs old when we got it and he is just fine with using it! The pack is about 2 years old and still in great condition. I recommend it to anyone with a dog that needs to focus a bit more during walks. Even just having the pack on them makes them more aware that it is `work' time and not `play' time."
5,Great for new parents,"I give the book to every new parent or parents to be. It gives them a very easy to read and understandable view, from the baby's perspective, of what's going on developmentally during the first couple years of birth. An excellent read for all parents!!!"
4,Review of AD for dummies,So far the book is right on and helpful as far as giving the back gorund of the AD system.Book showed up ontime and was good price.
2,Urgency,"Have been taking Prostate Power RX for a while now, and while I wasn't expecting miracles,so far I find it rather disappointing. It does little to relieve that pressure/urgency to empty the bladder, and frequency of urination. I do not recommend it. Would advise checking out ""prostatepillreport.com"" before ordering a prostate supplement."
4,pretty dope,liked it production was solid bootcamp click for life bcc p-body niga repin that duckdown shout out ta dru ha
5,Acer LCD monitor-WOW,"So much quality for a inexpensive price.My daughter refused to use other monitor in the house, she wants Acer LCD only."
2,Breaks easily,"This is my third time replacing this ac adapter. I have other laptops that are even older than the one I use this adapter for, which I have yet to have to replace. The same part breaks each time too making me think it's a defect in manufacturing that HP just doesn't want to acknowledge. The wire right before the part that plugs into the computer gets loose/frayed."
5,Perfect!,It was exactly what I needed . I was going to buy the exact same cord through best buy and it was gonna cost me $70.00!! This was Definately a deal!!!
1,they just keep breaking,"I'm on my way to my third adapter...unless you will be using your laptop on a desk and never move it, this WILL break and it won't take long...I think they were designed to break..."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I wish I had paid attention to these reviews before I purchased this product!! What a terrible waste of money. The product only worked for 7 months and HP support had the gall to tell me it was a software problem with my computer. HA How would I know when I can't charge the thing because the AC does not work. Spend your money elsewhere. This product stinks! Giving this one star is being generous.
2,Why add an adapter to the end,I just dont understand why there needs to be an adapter on the end and why does the adapter look like it doesnt fit all the way onto the cord. There's an unpleasant gap of metal showing. It also seems like it does not charge as fast as my previous HP 65w charger that came with my HP laptop.
2,fails to convince,"Research about linguistic relativity promises fascinating reading. Unfortunately, the majority of articles in the book are dry, dusty and full of overly academic language. The only piece really worth reading is Bowerman's article on the spacial categories of children which shows how differences in the perception of spacial relationsships (up/down, into, out of...) are linguistically encoded."
1,"Useful for ""titled"" readers. Useless for the rest of us.","I purchased this book and wish I hadn't. As a genealogical source for individuals searching their roots it is almost worthless. It is really a ""Who's Who"" of living title holders with specific and narrow info on their lineal descents. The individuals who appear in it are of families who already know their ancestry, and who in fact provide the data. This book contains virtually no useful information for collateral branches of titled families, which means that if you don't possess a hereditary title it will be very difficult or impossible to learn anything useful. If you're researching living title holders, it may be useful. If you're looking for your own roots, you'll probably be better off finding this in a library than paying for it."
1,Not of great value - not one for the home library.,"Yes, I have read through the book. I DO get a mention in it but still find it booring, useless and to me a great waste of money. Information contained is not upto date as I have NEVER received a request to update our Australian family links. My best comment is that it costs nothing to look at it in a Public Library."
5,great other than showing a rape,thought this was a great series. loved it. other than one part that i absolutely hate. they had no need to show a rape.
2,"He sure can noodle, but good music it ain't","After reading about THE BEST GUITARIST IN SPAIN, I just had to buy this.Well he might be the noodling champion of spain, but he is nowhere near the best guitarist. The material is well below average even for a SHRED / METAL cd. Most of the tunes are pointless noodling exercises. Not much in the way of melodie or emotion on this one. His style is nothing you havn't heard before ( and mostly done heaps better ).Try JORGE CASTRO or the VARGAS BLUES BAND if you want to listen to great players from spain, this guy is certainly not it.A MAJOR LETDOWN"
1,Too Big a Size,The lug nut is too big to be used on my 95 Accord. The person whom I bought the Accord had put in custom alloy wheels and there was not enough room to used 7/8 inch wrench to tighten the lug nut.
3,...,"The minimalistic artwork of this album is gorgeous and makes great use of typography, although the text is a little hard to read. But why a lily?! It's almost as if this band wants to have no street cred at all.Perhaps that really is the case, as their debut release makes it obvious that A Heart Well Ending is young. I applaud the band for being able to put together an album and sticking to it the way they have, because it seems pretty obvious that the band has fun doing what they do. However, the truth is that there isn't much the band can offer that hasn't already been offered. But if you are a fan of pop-punk and decent-looking rocker boys, then by all means, check out A Heart Well Ending."
4,A great historical fiction novel,"The year is 1193. King Richard the Lionheart has been captured while returning from the crusades by the Emperor of Germany. His Mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, struggles to amass Richard's ransom. In Wales, a large ransom payment disappears. Eleanor dispatches her man, Justin de Quincy to investigate.In Wales, Justin becomes immersed in the political intrigues of the Welsh court. As he slowly uncovers the clues to solve the mystery, he also discovers treachery that even includes Richard's deceitful brother, Prince John.The author, Sharon Kay Penman, is a prolific author of historical novels of England and Wales. This novel is the third in her ""Queen's Man Mysteries"" series. I enjoyed her writing style which made this novel a nice easy read."
2,Want this but not at $18.99 price point for Kindle,"I own almost all of Sharon Kay Penman in one form or another and in some cases mutliple formats for the same title (Trade, trade paper, AND Kindle). I even have 1 title that was available for Kindle that the publisher has withdrawn (Time and Chance). But I will not pay $18.99 for a kindle version of a slim 322 page novel. Too bad because I really would like to have all four Justin de Quincy mysteries on Kindle. Since I can get a mass market copy for $1 that's the route I will take with these."
4,A very good read,"This was a very good story to read. The story was well put together, and maintained my interest throughout, with a very good and unsuspected ending. Gripping ones attention. I would certainly recommend it to others, very nearly made the fifth star. I really had to think about it."
1,If You're Looking for Insight and Tips Look Elsewhere,"I picked this book up at the library. I was looking for some advice and insight to help alleviate my singledom. Maybe it's funny if you're married and you don't care any more, but mostly this book has just bummed me out. I got through the first 80 pages and decided to return it rather than risk paying a fine for something that is making me feel hopeless. I guess the scenarios are just too close to my real life experiences. If you're looking for good advice, this book probably will not have your answer."
4,Hilarious,"Okay, this is obviously a huge take off on ""those other books"" - but I have to say, I loved it....What I loved about this book is the fact that the authors, unlike ""those other books"" state their stories (from their own experiences) but do not try to shove down our throats a ""moral"" or ""lesson"" in each experience.The humour is great and both authors are self-depracating - which is great, for those of us who do not really want to be hit over the head with yet ""another"" how to relationship book.Its obvious these authors intended to write this books as part memoir (part therapeutic process perhaps?) - nonetheless this is a serious, fun, humourous look at the dating world.Buy it."
1,After 1st use the glass top broke by itself. No one wants to take responsibility!!,"I have call the manufacturer, they do not have any in stock. I've called Antonline (the seller) they don't have any answers. What am I going to do?Please respond, as I have an appliance I can not use.Thank you,Carlos Vazquez917-602-0571"
4,Docking Cradle,The docking cradle should be an included item with the phone. Without it your phone can slide around or even fall off. A needed item.
2,"One lasted 3 weeks, one lasted a few months....","So, um, I guess they're improving Quality Control, right?A charging/synching cradle is absolutely neccessary for a Treo- the nice bright screen eats batteries FAST, as does an active internet connection. I leave mine charging most of the time that I'm in the office, and with it in the cradle, I can easily grab it if the phone rings-not as easy with it plugged in.I returned my first cradle after a month, thinking I had just drawn the unlucky dud. My second one conked out after a few months. Same symptom for both- would not reliably synch. Usually I can get it to work if I jiggle everything just so, but it is quickly getting to the point where that doesnt work EVER.I have a third party cradle coming in the mail. Keeping my fingers crossed!"
3,Kind of expensive for what it is. And it came damaged,"First, let me say that I count on buyer feed-backs for my purchases on Amazon, but sometimes the feedback's maybe a little low for some weird reason. But this really does deserve 3 stars.I gave this a 3 star review for two main reasons.1st reason is the cost, I think this is a little over priced, its plastic (kind of cheap plastic too), the light-up eyes are just OK, ones is brighter than the other. there a few graphical bullet marks that look pretty bad too. And this is what I can see through the plastic window.2nd reason is the item came broken, there is a leg piston/brace thing that attaches to the body with a screw, and it looks like the screw is missing so the piston is dangly . The packaging is covered in dust(petty I know, but this is a gift) due to it being fulfilled by amazon I can only get a refund and then buy another one. That is a huge connivance due to Christmas being so close."
5,Superb Knife from Emerson,"Emerson makes really high quality and REALLY expensive knives. Many go for $300 or more. The Hard Wear line from Emerson is a much cheaper alternative. Seki knives is the maker, but using Emerson's standards. I own two of them. They are great for camping, cutting anything imaginable or self defense."
5,MAASDAM PULR,THE PULLER WORKED AS ADVERTISED. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS ON SOFT GROUND WHERE I HAD TO PUT A BLOCK UNDER THE BASE SO IT WOULDN'T SINK DOWN . OTHER WISE IT WAS EASY TO USE.
2,Maasdam PP100 Post Puller,"The Maasdam Pow'R Pull PP100 Post Puller is constructed of very light metalic tubing. Much too light for the advertised/promoted function of pulling various types of fence posts out of the ground. In this reviewer's opinion if this ""power puller"" can pull it out of the ground then you could pull it out by hand unassisted. The one that I purchased has a success rate of 0 for 1. After unsucessfully attempting to pull a 6 foot standard metal ""T"" Post driven into solid ground about 18"" I added a short piece of pipe to increase the leverage. I was not too supprised when what ""gave up"" was the handle instead of the post. The bussiness end of the tube comprising the handle is now in the shape of a ""banana"". If you are looking for a serious tool to assist you in removing post from most types of ground/soil then I would suggest that you continue your search after a brief look at the ""Maasdam Pow'R Pull PP100, Post Pull'R"". Pay More. Get More!"
4,Reasonable price proposition,"Decent batteries at a low price. Perhaps not the highest capacity, but good for everyday uses."
5,Extremely Helpful,"I must say, it's a wonderful read for anyone with a parent with BPD or BPD - tendencies. I spent years trying to figure out what was so ""off"" in my childhood household - this book lays it out and laid the foundation for several ""A-ha"" moments. I highly recommend.You can see the effects of the book here:[...]"
1,faulty product,"I bought this so I could listen to my Ipod with my girlfriend, and it was delivered just before we left. We just got back from a 2 week trip to Turkey, and the splitter was worthless. It has a bad connection so only one of the two headsets works. Very frustrating as I dd not have a chance to get another in time."
3,Easy read,"If you are looking for a light, easy read, this is the ticket! I am a preschool teacher and belong to several groups. With limited time, this book fit right into my schedule. It helped get me in the holiday mood and made me realize how commercialized Christmas really is.Skipping Christmas pokes fun at how over the top people get during the holidays. It kind of reminded me of the Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase. I even rented the DVD version, Christmas With the Kranks. Great movie!Thank you,Riley"
2,Grisham is grasping,"I have read every book Grishman has written. Although a deviation from his lawyer tales, the book lacks depth. An OK Christmas story, but a book that really left me flat. I expect more from Grisham."
2,skip this christmas book,"Having read most of Grisham's other books , and enjoying most I jumped at the chance to read his latest as an escape from the hustle of the holidays. I should have skipped , ""Skipping Christmas"". This was certainly not his best venture. I almost wonder if he even wrote it! By its pure brevity I knew there wouldn't be much there as far as plot, but thought it might be inspiring like, ""The Christmas Box"" of past years. It was so predictable and sterotypical. It might just make it as a script for a Chevy Chase movie--the part when Mr. Krank falls off the roof-- oh, wait a minute ,that's already been done! I almost wonder why he wasted his time on this. Surely he doesn't need the money and I wouldn't waste yours."
1,Diminishing Returns,"While the first third of this book is reasonably engaging, the story begins to repeat itself. The book grows redundant. The same point is made again and again. Things are said over and over. Buy the book for more.Boredom is an art; absolute boredom is an achievement. I hereby tip my hat."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Grisham should be ashamed of this book, which is complete drivel. I couldn't stand any of the characters, ESPECIALLY the protagonists. Whiny, spoiled housewife and narcissistic, spineless, rude accountant - what's not to like there??? By the middle of the book, I was actually looking forward to their trip being ruined! Completely unbelievable scenarios and dialogue throughout (what planet do these people live on??), capped with an utterly ridiculous ending. (We're supposed to consider Luther a hero because he gave away something that he wasn't going to use anyway?? Um, o.k.) What a waste of time and money - like something from a middle school creative writing class."
1,The Worst Novel I've Read,"Someone call Clive Cussler and tell him this piece of amateurish drivel supplanted _Inca Gold_ as the worst novel I've read. Having never picked up a Grisham novel before, I was expecting something at least clever or well-written, based on his popularity. Sadly, this novel is to good writing what any Jim Carrey performance is to good acting; that is to say, not remotely related."
1,shallow and racist,"The only reason I bought this book is because I had read and liked some previous books by Grisham. I definetely don't recommend it! It is a shallow book, nothing special about it but most important, clauses like ""he wasn't dark at all"" a comment that makes a dark! expected Peruvian suddenly handsome and ""he moved up another notch"" because he had been educated abroad in England (Peru is not abroad??) are unacceptable.Grisham dropped more than a couple of notches!!"
1,Skip Skipping Christmas,"After reading the first chapter of Skipping Christmas on the internet I was motivated enough to part with some of my hard-earned money to buy a copy.Unfortunately I wasted my money. The rest of the book did not live up to the first chapter.Having read some of Grisham's exciting writing,I am having trouble with the notion that this is one of his books. His other books have main characters who are strong individuals. The Krank's, on the other hand are wishy-washy, afraid of their neighbors, terrified of disapproval by others. The theme of the book-that Christmas has become an expensive chore instead of a delight-certainly has merit. Luther Krank's decision to ""skip"" Christmas (meaning skip all the usual preparations) and go on a cruise instead seems innovative and I cheered him. But the rest of the book is spend with Luther and Nora abolutely COWERING in fear over what their neighbors say and do.Very frustrating silly book. Anyone want to buy mine?Lynn Badler"
1,what a piece of ...,"Don't be taken in by this book and the people who love it. It's 45 minutes of reading time that you'll never get back!The main themes of this story are (1) all men are ultimately controlled by henpecking wives and neighbors (cute huh?), (2) it's impossible to skip christmas (how could you even think such a thing?), (3) neighbors actually care whether you put a plastic frosty on your roof or not, and (4) christmas isn't christmas unless you have a turkey and all the traditional trappings...That is all I have to say."
3,Not your typical John Grisham,I found this book to be mundane. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen - that's the only way I got through the entire book. Thank goodness it was short - I didn't waste a whole lot of time.
4,Grinch is Back on Hemlock Street....but will he stay?,A very quick read and delightful story. Grisholm writes and entertaining story of a family that decides to forego Christmas and take a Cruise instead. You can imagine what scenerio's come to fruition throughout this funny short story.A cute ending that will instill the spirit of Christmas lasts forever. I recommend.
3,"Good Beginning, Silly Ending","This one gave me mixed feelings. The beginning was great but the last part almost forced me to put it down. I found myself completely agreeing with the absurdity of Christmas spending and decadent traditions. There's a lot to relate to in the first part of the book. The middle takes a disturbing twist with the subtle and overt coercion of the protagonists (the Kranks). I wanted to tell the Krank's neighbors and friends to ""cram it with walnuts."" Unfortunately, the last part takes a frustrating turn into absurdity. The marathon events during the last day are completely unbelievable. The ""rescue"" and heartstring ending is a bit predictable but makes for a warm finish.""A Painted House"" was a refreshing and wonderful tale about simple life. This story, however, is not nearly as compelling. It's a decent quick read but is not on my recommended list."
5,Must read,After reading this book when it first came out I gave it as Christmas presents to friends and relitives. It truly is a joy to read with great humor for all.
2,Not his best work,"This short novel started out extremely slow. It was difficult to get into but I plugged along anyway knowing Grisham would give me a great ending. He took a long time setting up the story for the ending, which was the only thing I truly enjoyed. I'm glad I read this story, however, Grisham should stick to what he knows best - the law and the courtroom."
2,Grisham's Weakest Book,"This is my far John Grisham's weakest book. He is one of my favorite authors, so I was quite disappointed when I finished reading Skipping Christmas. Although it is a short novel, I took my time finishing it because it just wasn't a page turner as nearly all Grisham's books are. The book's greatest downfall comes from its complete focus on the negitive aspects of Christmas. It certainly did not put me in the Christmas spirit."
2,Negative,"Not up to Grsham's usual quality, the first of his books I could easily put down and walk away from and the first one I wanted my money back on. How long can you drag on whining and a scrooge like attitude. I loved all his other books and am hoping for more of the same."
5,"Perfect to read on a cold winters night, with a hot toddie","This book is great light reading for the holiday season. The story is touching and funny and reads easily. Yes, it does bring tears to your eyes, but in a warm holiday way. Perfect if you want to curl up with a hot toddie on a cold winters night and read a fun modern christmas story. Perfect story for those with children who need a nice break. I was glad I read it."
5,"Hysterical, not heart warming!","I loved this book. It is far from the typical Grisham legal fair, but something that everyone has thought of doing at least once in their lifetimes - skipping Christmas! The characters are wonderful - the wife, pathetic, the husband, oh, so stalwart in his resolve to skip the holidays - until a wrench is thrown into their plans. Do yourself a favor, Grisham fan or not, and read this next November!"
4,Superb story teller,"This book proves, once more, what a writer Mr Grisham is. Far away from the lawyer thing, this book is a very curious and funny side of the impossibility of simply changing plans when this concerns to the familiar and the community life. Incredibly wrong about the possibility of skipping the Christmas ""obligations"" the Krank's family provides us with a hilarious adventure."
5,Skipping Christmas,I thought it was an unusal work for John. It was cute and sweet. I enjoyed it but somehow the title is missing something. I wouldn't of called it skipping Christmas
3,Not impressed.,"I got this book hoping that it would help me get into the spirit of Christmas. It only served to get me in an even worse frame of mind.I agreed with the Krank's decision at first but then felt very let down as the book continued. If John Grisham was trying to convey the spirit of Christmas, he failed in my eyes. I just thought the whole thing was a little too contrived.I know the author is trying to spread his wings but this was not a good attempt. Just another commercial ploy to sell books (he got my money). Maybe he should just stick to what he does best-thrillers.The shelves are filled with wonderful, heartwarming stories of the holiday spirit and those struggling to find it, this book should not be a part of them."
5,"Another Tale of ""Scrouge""",Grisham describes the life of a married couple deciding to skip out on the annual Chrismas festivities. The book is wonderfully written and redefines the idea of the meaning of Christmas. This is a heart-warming novel written for those who love the traditional holiday season (and those who love to laugh-out-loud as well).
2,Uninspired,The mix of an unoriginal storyline and uninteresting characters resulting in a less than enjoyable read. Not one of Grisham's best works.
3,Pleasant,This is not great literature but a simple pleasant read. A time to relax with an enjoyable tale which is a huge departure from other Grisham works of which I have read all.
5,Skipping Christmas,What a fun and comical book! I definitely think they should make a movie out of this one. It would be the new Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase (a classic).
2,Definitely NOT worth a buy,"A good storyline, as can be expected from John Grisham, but Skipping Christmas definitely lacks the substance of most of his previous works. It's an easy read as the book is quite short. Worth borrowing a copy but not something you'll go back to if it's on your bookshelf. Skipping Christmas has the feel of a last-minute push by a publisher to ""get one in the aisles"" before the holiday shopping rush. Save your money."
1,"Boring, repetitive, just skip it!","I was looking for a book that would help with the Christmas spirit outside of the material aspects we get hung up on. Maybe the end of this book does that, but the majority of the book is just plain boring. So they decide to skip Christmas. Fine. But it just drags on, and on.Best to just skip the time it takes to read this book and go for a walk in the woods and think about what Christmas means to you."
3,Utah Reader,"A good book for readers who are wondering if all the shopping, wrapping presents, and attending family or work parties are worth the effort. One couple decides to break with tradition. The results will have you laughing out loud as they try to save what's left of Christmas. The ending is very satisfying and will keep you thinking about it long after you close the book."
3,Subtle racism spoils this otherwise fun-to-read book,"I've always enjoyed Grisham's novels, but am disturbed by the subtle racism in his newest book. The book was fun-to-read and was read easily in one afternoon. It had the pace of watching a movie. The jabs at Peruvians, though, spoiled it for me. I do not want to tell anything about the ending of the book for anyone reading it, but especially at the end, I found the racism a bit over-the-top.The book really seemed like it was made to be a movie, and it looks like that is exactly what will happen. Hopefully, they will take the racist dialogue out of it though."
3,A different kind of Christmas story,The story starts out slow but then takes you through some twists and turns. It was a fun read - very different from the usual Grisham fare. Some would call the difference refreshing but I call it just a difference :)
3,Charming and funny,"With the Kranks only daughter, Blair, in Peru with the Peace Corps, they find themselves not feeling very festive this holiday season. Nora is always thinking about Blair and on the verge of tears, while Luther, an accountant, starts looking into how much money Christmas costs them every year. Luther gets the bright idea to skip Chirstmas this year - no tree, no gifts, no Christmas parties, etc. - and take a cruise instead. They would actually be saving money considering Christmas cost them over $6,000 the previous year. Their friends and neighbors don't take too well to their idea, however, and many hijinks ensue.This is only the second book I've read by Grisham. I didn't like the first one (The Appeal) at all, but I found this one rather enjoyable. It has everything you want in a light holiday read. It's charming, funny, and manages to get the point of the holiday season across very well. I can see me recommending it to my friends in the future."
3,Good holiday reading,This book is easy to read and does a good job in driving home the message about the true meaning of the season. It's surely not his typical courtroom drama but certainly entertaining. Would love to see the movie..
2,"Bah, Humbug!","Unoriginal, formulaic, its a quick holiday read that isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the best. I disliked the characters from the opening chapter and never felt they ever rose above one dimension. As a minority, I was horrified at the shallowness of the characters when they fervently hoped their daughter's friend ""wasn't dark."" What? Good news. Later it was determined he ""wasn't dark at all, in fact he was lighter than they were!"" What a relief. And what dreck."
4,"Twas the night before Christmas, not a lawyer in sight","I don't know if I'd call this book a Christmas classic any more than I'd call ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" a classic Christmas movie, but, just as I enjoy seeing the antics of the Griswolds every December, I'm sure I will be returning to this book for some light holiday entertainment. And what's wrong with that? By now you know the story: a middle-aged couple faced with celebrating Christmas without their daughter who joined the Peace Corps and was shipped off to South America decide to sign up for a Christmas cruise and skip all the hustle and bustle of the holiday season. Of course, that's easier said than done, as pressure from friends, neighbors, merchants, and civic charity groups threatens to wear down their resolve. They certainly can't get away with skipping Christmas....can they? This is certain to become a movie showing at a theater near you for the Christmas of 2003 or 4."
4,Enjoyable Christmas Read,"Skipping Christmas was a light and enjoyable read. Grisham succeeds in portraying a crazy, hectic Christmas rush that almost overshadows the purpose of the season. The ending makes reading about all of the annoyances that abound during the Christmas-time craziness worthwhile and warms the heart."
5,I loved this little book,"This is a well crafted movie script disguised as a book. Grisham is terrific in this one from start to finish. I couldnt put this book down. It has real meaning to me and it rightly illustrates the cynicism in many of us about the Holidays. To me it asks the question ""Why do we celebrate Christmas?"". Is it about the rituals (some mind numbingly stupid, some actually fun), the spoiled kids, Christ's Birthday?. I like the message: Forgoe your own self interests and make somebodys world a brighter place. I am going to try to do that myself this year. Thanks Mr. Grisham for your sermon."
1,Skip this Book,"Absolutely horrible. Every single character is barely fleshed out, the writing is no more than adequate, and the plot could come straight from a Lifetime movie. However, what really kills this book is the preposterous ending. After an incredible amount of animosity builds up between Krank and his neighbors, all is forgiven and forgotten in the last few pages. People are trying to get him arrested, and, a few pages later, they are helping him, or receiving gifts from him. Are you kidding? I would never forgive neighbors who treated me that way. Yeah, yeah, it is just a book. But, to defy reality this severely is a crime. I think this book took longer to read then to write."
5,Grisham without Lawyers!,"This is not your typical Grisham novel. Sure, the quick pace is there and the incisive insight into the character; but this is a completely different kind of book than he usually writes. It's rare that a book makes me laugh out loud, but this one had me chuckling several times. The premise is simple: Christmas is overblown, so when the middle-aged Luther and Nora Krank are facing their first Christmas without their daughter at home, they decide to skip all of the traditional celebration and spend their money on a cruise. If you liked the movies ""A Christmas Story"" and ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"", this book should be right up your alley. It's close enough to reality to make me wonder about the holidays next year...hmmm"
1,Not funny. Waste of time. Distasteful. Boring. Awful.,"If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story. The end.Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas ""happen"" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home. In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth. I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it. Why torture yourself?It would have been a good story if they did this. Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of ""making Christmas happen.""A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read. Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it."
1,Skip This Book,"Annoying story, annoying characters, annoying waste of money.Skipping this book would have been a better move........."
1,Not Worth It,Personally I thought this book was awful. I am a huge fan of John Grisham and I did't think this was even close to being as good as his others. The entire plot line is in the title and the end was extremely predictable.
3,Are Americans Really as Awful as Mr Grisham Portrays them?,"The problem for an English reader of this sentimental story is that he can't know how exaggerated it is. Do Americans really behave so oddly at Christmas? Is it possible that a family which decides not to put something called a ""Frosty"" (seems to be a model of a snowman) on its roof could be ostracised by all the neighbours? Do Americans preparing to go on a cruise think it perfectly normal to acquire a tan from a machine before departing? One hopes that Mr Grisham has grossly exaggerated the traits of his fellow countrymen, but there is a lingering doubt.Anyway, a competent though not remarkable book.Charles"
4,Merry fun for a Merry Christmas,"As a huge Grisham fan, I'll read anything he writes. I have always preferred his more traditional courtroom novels, and bought ""Skipping Christmas"" expecting that it probably wouldn't be as good.I was wrong. It was just as good as most of his courtroom novels and was a perfect afternoon's laughfest.Who knew this guy could write such fabulous comedy? Actually, I did -- his comedy is really quite good in places in some of his other books. But this one is an out and out sitcom and enjoyable from beginning to end.One word of warning. The book gets off to a slow start. I would call it more ""amusing"" than downright funny for the first half. Then a specific event occurs which starts the laughs flowing, and it's hysterical from there. So for those who may have started this book and put it down a few pages in, you really owe it to yourself to give the book another try."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"What a unique and interesting book. For years, my husband and I have thought that the holiday were overrated. But, we had the same outcome as the Kranks! Definately a great read or gift for someone - especially when the holidays have overtaken their ability to think clearly! Enjoy!"
3,decent beach book,"I had never heard of this author or the book and bought it at the supermarket so I wasn't expecting too much. But I was pleasantly surprised. While parts of the book were a little dull and slow, the overall setting kept things moving along quite nicely. Of course the author makes heavy use of some pretty standard hooks: sex, Japanese history, drugs, sex, violent death, basic murder mystery plot, sex and naked women. But hey, this is a supermarket book, you kind of expect that in a paperback bestseller.There was too much about nothing concerning the heroine. The Japense equivalent of a woman in a Steven Segal movie, I guess. But I did enjoy the book. Definitely a great read for a plane trip or the beach."
2,Disappointing,"The fourth entry in the Sosakan Sano Ichiro series is set in 1690 Tokyo. From the opening scene of Sano's arranged marriage to the denouement, this outing leaves a flat aftertaste. Sano's bride, Hirata, has a penchant for investigation and she sets out to find the murderer of Harume, the pregnant favorite of the ruling Shogun. Sadly, the relationship between Sano and Reiko reads like a bad romance novel, complete with fiery tempers, illogical misunderstandings, and the requisite revealing of the killer. T his outing should come with a strong warning for those readers who do not like graphic sex in their mysteries.Rowland appears to have done her research, but unfortunately used it all in this book. Perhaps because of her concentration on the history, she paid less attention to developing her characters because they remain cardboard-flat and the dialogue overly dramatic.This was a disappointing entry in an otherwise enjoyable series."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I would like to comment on the author Laura Rowland. I've read this book and found it very interesting and exciting. It has intrigue, sex, action and great imagination on the author's part. I would reccomend this book for all people who like to read about Japan."
5,Great DVD,My son loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the Disney channel and loves his DVD collection for the afternoons. Great DVD.
4,Super Cute,"What can I say, It's MickeyMouse Clubhouse?! It is everything you would expect it to be. My son loves watching this dvd."
4,it was good to say it was mostly about salem,"ok if you dont have patience dont buy this book as only about one third of it is about sabrina the rest is about salem and his doggie friend and parts seem to repeat themselfs but i wouldnt completly rule the book out, as its not as boring as dogs life."
3,"Very good for GRE, lack some information for GMAT","This book is very good for those who wants to take the GRE Test. However, for GMAT it lack some important review."
3,It's not great but not that bad either..,"This book is definitely not as good as A Hero Born. It's entertaining, but the sense of flow and characterisation that made the first book so good are lacking in this sequel. But that can't totally be blamed on Michael Stackpole. The thing to remember here is that most of this story was written by William Wu and not M.Stackpole. The story concept and characters are Wu's. Stackpole only made modifications to the story so that it could get published, so technically it's not really a Stackpole original piece. But nonetheless, it's still worth a read."
4,"Meat, not gruel","I'm puzzled by the complaint (made by several reviewers below) that the plot threads are never tied up (yes they are, in the final third of the novel) and that we never find out what the mysterious punch cards do (we most certainly do -- see pp. 387, 421, and 429, where we're told EXACTLY what their function is).This is admittedly a novel that has to be read carefully; one can't just slurp it down like jello without doing any work. It's a serious novel, thank goodness -- not ""light entertainment.""I'm also puzzled that nobody seems to have noticed what a highly *political* novel this is. This book is much more about political and cultural ideology than it is about alternative-history technology."
3,Very Disappointing,"Bruce Sterling is one of the finest writers working these days, and William Gibson, while something of a one-trick pony, can write a good novel. You would expect THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE to be pretty good. Certainly the concept (alternate history Victoriana with Babbage's machine a reality) is fertile. Sterling and Gibson did their homework (almost too well--the references to Disraeli's books are likely to fall very flat for most readers). The prose is nothing special, but is certainly readable.And yet the novel doesn't hold together. It's difficult to put a finger on just what's wrong with THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE. The ending is both weak and contrived, but that isn't really the fatal flaw. Somehow, a lot of inventive sound and clever fury adds up to nothing much, and even leaves a slightly distasteful sensation in the reader's mind.Read Gibson's NEUROMANCER, or pretty much anything by Sterling, and you'll be much better off than you will be reading this book."
1,More than the sum of their faults,"Gibson and Stirling write such wonderfully crafted books that you have to wonder how together they wrote THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE into the ground. The characters in the story act as if they are the ones who are gear-driven automatons. The plot consists of winding their keys and letting them wander aimlessly around a seedy and unconvincingly technological Victorian Englnd. Gibson and Stirling eventually let their story wind down and have to conjure up a disappointing ending before all of its momentum is lost. Whoops, too late.I am amazed by the number of people who like this novel. It is flat and tedious especially when compared to their other great works, such as Gibson's NEUROMANCER and nearly every other book Stirling has written. Ignore this book if you have not read it and enjoy Gibson and Stirling, separately, at their best."
1,Possibly his worst book ever,"Gibson wrote many great books.He may even deserve credit for having the entire cyberpunk genre spring to live as everyone was trying to imitate Neuromancer.This is by far the worst book by Gibson I read. Yes, there's a decent description of live in an alternative past. And even a memorable scene. But overall the book is boring, the characters are uninteresting, and the peculiarities of this alternative past just don't lead to anything.If you haven't yet read Neuromancer, Count Zero, Virtual Light, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Idoru, Pattern Recognition, etc. why would you read this book?"
2,Count Me Among the Disappointed,"How could you go wrong with a plot based on the What If of Charles Babbage's difference engine actually being built, working, and changing the course of human innovation by bringing about the computer age as a realized steampunk past? How could you go wrong with a team of the most talented cyberpunk writers, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling?Well, it went wrong. I forced myself through it, I had to get to the end regardless how many other things I'd rather be doing at the time. The characters didn't engage my interest for the most part and in the rare case that one did get into a bit of interesting tiff, the authors shortchanged me by going away to a different and less interesting storyline. There were so many starts and stops that I just lost track of who was doing what, where, and why should I care.It could have been so much more, but it wasn't.- CV Rick"
3,Could have been better,"This book was fun and hard to put down, but it was also overly long and the ending, what should have been the best part due to its massive setup, was not good at all. It's like they reached their deadline and just jotted something down on the way to the printer's. Could have used cooler steam-tech."
2,Too many cooks spoil the soup,"I'm guessing the creation of the book went something like this:Gibson: Hey Bruce, want to write a book about steam powered computing?Sterling: Yeah, that sounds really interesting. Let's do lots of research and make it sound very authentic.A few months pass....Gibson: Well, I've actually written the entire book now. How did your research go?Sterling: That's funny, I wrote the entire book too. Why don't we throw dice. If it's an even number, we'll put one of your chapters in, if it's an odd number we'll put one of mine in.Gibson: Sounds good."
2,Dissapointing,"I usually enjoy Gibson, but this time I felt let down. I enjoyed segments of the book, but I never felt like it tied together. The importance of the cards was never displayed, even indirectly. I really struggled throught the ending and never felt like there was any point to the story."
4,Written for a small audience,"Reader, beware; this is not for the majority of Gibson or Sterling fans. If your grasp of history enables you to recognize the street address of the Hellfire Club, or the name of the woman who kept that room, you will find a fantastic cornucopia of clever allusions in every chapter of this book. However, the plot is neither as well crafted or as satisfying as the wonderful background setting, so readers without historical interests (or with poor educations) will find this book unrewarding. History buffs, especially those with interests in phrenology or early computing machines, will suffer the relative weakness of the story line for the pleasure of immersion in the theme."
2,"Awesome world-building, disappointing ending","What I appreciated about this steampunk book was that it didn't have the unrealistic supernatural/gothic element (vampires, werewolves, elder gods, etc.) that are in so many books of the sub-genre. It is just good, solid alternate-history world-building. However the ending was disappointing / anticlimactic and a bit hard to understand since it was told in a completely different style than the rest of the book (via newspaper clippings)."
1,Tedious and Annoying,"While you keep hoping it will get better, it sucks. Gibson's other novels are better. Don't know any of Sterling's work."
2,"title is bad, book is good","i'm sorry, but all i can say is that it only mentioned the difference engine once, and in the last few pages. It didn't even say what the difference engine was. Other than that, the book was well written and had a better than mediocre plot, but as a rule the title should have something to do with the book."
5,DIY,"Anyone who owns a car needs this sort of book; it gives you an idea about how stuff works and a better informed driver is a better driver/owner/responsible so and so. For less than a lunch, you can have a wonderful resource at your fingertips when things go haywire."
4,"short, but not disappointing","""The lonesome town is crowded, i'm always first in line...with fresh new starts for broken hearts and wasting all my time..."" Renaissance is much shorter than the usual mxpx albums but songs like Lonesome Town make the 18 minutes (9 tracks) worth it. I'll listen to that one, Party II (Time To Go), and The Opposite over and over again. Nothing compares to the EPM, but Renaissance is full of fast, catchy songs that are especially great for the car. Don't get your hopes up, but check it out."
2,MxPx needs to get back to the old school sound,"Lately, MxPx has been sounding like all these pop punk boy bands. When are they going to get some stuff together like the good old days, back in '92. None of this la la la junk, let's get louder and faster already."
4,perfect gift for TOH fans,"This is a magazine for old house lovers -- people who like the style of an older home, for whom the things that break and the things that creak inspire renovation not cursing.My wife and I live in our second old house, and have watched the TV show since before our first. For us pragmatic Norm the woodworker, blow-dried Steve the host, and spendthrift Richard the plumbing/HVAC guy are like family. This magazine provides occasional coverage of the project house you see on PBS which is a bonus for fans. But its main focus is to show you how you can fix up your own old house.It is a great source of ideas, inspiration, and the vendors who can sell you what you'll need. Got an old house and the money and patience for renovation? If you do, get this magazine."
3,handyman magazine,I've only received a couple issues but I've enjoyed reading it although I haven't gleaned any valuable information that is useful so far.
5,great gift for a homeowner,I have given this as a gift to both my husband and father-in-law. They are both very handy and own older homes. It is perfect. I even enjoy reading my husbands for organizational tips.
4,This magazine is a keeper,"I enjoy the t.v show This Old House and Ask This Old House. This magazine is a continuation of these. It has major repair ideas for sure, but, it also gives ideas on smaller-scale home projects. It is informative, imaginative and fun to browse through. If you use a little creativity and imagination, you can use some of their ideas in your own home on a smaller scale. This is the perfect magazine for a do-it-yourselfer like my husband and me. The ideas and possibilities are endless. Even if I can't do them myself in my own home, I enjoy the ideas I get from reading and searching the pages for ideas. This magazine is a keeper!"
1,magazine is mostly advertising!,"I thought I was subscribing to a ""help and idea"" product...butinfo and creative ideas were very much lacking for ""home improvement."" I wish I could cancel the subscription!!!"
2,SAD DAY FOR KAY FANS,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE KAY'S WRITING AND SO LAST LIGHT WAS A TOUGH READ FOR ME. DIDN'T LIKE THE CHARACTERS OR CARE ABOUT THEM. THE FAIRY STUFF A COMPLETE DISTRACTION AND MEANINGLESS. (IT'S HARD TO GET WORKED UP OVER A SHIMMERING NOTHING WITH NO SOUL OR PERSONALITY.) GRATUTIOUS [Adult relations]. LOTS OF BIRDWALKING. FELT LIKE I WAS READING DISCARDED PORTIONS OF EARLIER WORK. THIS GUY (HA) IS A GREAT WRITER AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS NEXT PIECE, BUT LAST LIGHT I JUST DONATED TO THE LIBRARY. OH, HERE'S TIGANA, [AHH]."
1,Beverly Hills Gold Parfum,"I figured this would smell OK if the Spelling empire had anything to do with it. Boy was I wrong. It smells awful on me. Maybe just a bad mix of my chemistry and the ingredients in this perfume, but I'm sure glad I didn't pay a lot for it..."
1,Item Decription Item Description Item Description!,"I bought this item thinking it was the movie Starring Humphrey Bogart. Upon receiving it I discovered that ""no"" it was not. This is actually a BOOK on dvd. Thinking that maybe it was my mistake I went back to Amazon and looked at the description. It said only that it is a DVD, nothing else. I think that if Amazon were to change the description to something like: Book on DVD, it would make more sense. However, in spite of this error on both their part and mine, the product did ship to me very quickly and the refund was quick too. My review is 1 star for the decription. However, I would give 4 stars for the refund process."
1,Bad doesn't do it justice,"This was a horrific book,fairly inaccurate and just crude. The author spent most of his time showing us his raunchy vocabulary, instead of delving into the subject matter. I wouldn't reccomend wasting your time by reading it.If you are looking for a good one for the coffee table, try Judith Bennett's Sex Signs: A womens guide..."
2,Dodge Diesel Ram TPS,"I bought this product to replace the one on my 1994 Dodge 2500 Diesel Ram which had developed a dead spot, as they always do. The first one I received could not be installed and adjusted to meet spec's. I sent it back for replacement. The second unit was identical to the first in that it could not be installed to meet spec's. I found that the only thing I could do was to drill out the two mounting holes by a great deal so that this unit could be rotated sufficiently to meet installation spec's. Doesn't anyone check to verify that these units can meet application specific specifications? Next time I need to replace my TPS I'll look for another manufacturer."
5,Christmas Tradition,"I bought this book for my children about 30 years ago. It came with a 45rpm record. We loved reading it and listening to the song every Christmas! Now I read it to my grandchildren and they love it also! I could never figure out how it didn't become a Christmas classic or even made into a Chritmas video, it is such a great story. The only problem is, we don't have a way to play the record, so my grandkids don't know the song. Last night on Christmas eve, my granddaugher starting telling my son about the book and both he (33 years old) and his sister (35 years old) started sing the song at the same time! It was such GREAT memory!Our book and record is still in perfect condition!"
5,Finally getting the recognition they deserve,"I heard this band about a year and a half ago. The song was an old version of In Dying Days. I thought it was incredible. I then heard the old version of Hester Prynne, and the songs they had on their purevolume. They had an old song called Before The Break Of Dawn, and it was incredible, but these songs on the full length totally slay everything they've ever done. This is probably the best cd I've bought since Through The Eyes Of The Dead's Bloodlust. A while back, I heard they got signed to Mediaskare and were putting out a full length. The first song I heard off of it was Strife (Chug Chug). This the definition of ""metalcore"" or whatever people are calling it now-a-days. This has everything metal (blast beats, sick riffs and speed picking)and it's combined with hardcore (2-steps and breakdowns). This is bound to be one of the best releases of 2006. I know it already."
2,You aren't missing much,"If you're a Kottke fan like I am, play your older discs and don't bother shelling out for this one. Too many vocals. The instrumentals plow little or no new ground. His first half-dozen or so albums remain my favorites. However, to see him perform live is still a tremendous pleasure, regardless of the material."
3,funny but not enough material to be good value,seems to be made from intercutting 3 episodes of SNL. running time is not as long as we expected and quality of the video transfer is not great.
4,great setup but a bit old-fashioned,"As a German tutor and native speaker, I really appreciate the way this book is set up and systematically builds one lesson on the next. In the exercises, it reviews information learned in the last few chapters.In my opinion, the only little draw back (and the reason that I did not give 5 stars) is that it would need some updating as far as some of the pictures and words are concerned. It is quite uncommon in modern German to use terms like ""der Knabe"" or ""das Fräulein Lessing"".Other than that, I am completely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to any beginning learner."
5,Beginners can't go wrong with this book.,"This book was the fifth one I acquired in a previously unsuccessful attempt to learn German on my own. When it arrived from one of Amazon's ""other"" sellers, I thought, ""Oh no."" My copy was so old it had a ""standard book number"" and an old, creased cover. But it turned out to be exactly what I had needed to steadily begin learning to speak German, and to make my German-English dictionary and the three other books useful references!""German, How to Speak and Write It"" provides, with its artwork and approach, the perfect jump-start to begin doing just what the title says. It cost less than any of my other German books, but it has been by far the most useful of all!"
2,"Nice hat but not ""One size fits all""",I'm a Glock gun owner and have been holding out to buy this hat because I wear a large hat size. I finally caved and bought it. What a disappointment! This hat looks like it was made for a kid. So much for One size fits all.
3,"""Without A Map""","I rented this movie just because I wanted to see how ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""-movie's Barty Crouch Jr. was looking like - David Tennant is good-looking and charming, but this movie was not a movie I would ever buy! So, if you are a David Tennant-fan - rent it, if you like. But you'll be disappointed if you buy it. Enjoy David!"
2,Horrid little film.,"This movie had all the potential to be a good little film about the ugly little relationship between an artist and his muse-lover. However, the disjointed story telling provided no plot or motive for the characters. I was hoping for more."
2,Disappointed,"First of all, the ovulation strips that I received were not the ones pictured. The ones pictured are green, and the ones I received were pink. If a vendor were to sell their product, they should at least provide the correct pictures, because it makes the customer doubt if the correct product was received. But these were what I got, so I used them.Second of all, the ovulation strips never gave me a positive result, even though I tested twice a day. I know I ovulated because the ultrasound showed my erupted follicle already released an egg, and my blood test also showed that I ovulated. I know I have a short LH surge, which is why I test twice a day. I had NEVER missed my surge ever since I tested twice a day, until now.I had always been impressed with internet test strips, so I thought I'd try these ones because they were cheaper than what I had purchased before. But this batch was unfortunately a disappointment."
5,"So awesome, so affordable!","I love these strips!! Plus pregnancy tests too - you can't even buy three pregnancy tests for the price of this whole kit. Its so affordable that anyone can test for ovulation, starting from month one."
2,Not too sure about these,"I have had the best success with First Response 6 Days sooner. I tried these and A) I never got a true positive on the OPKs and B) the pregnancy tests kept coming up negative even after my period was due; a week after it turns out I was quite pregnant (per my doc), and then and only then did I finally get a strong positive on these. Word to the wise: most women that order these kits I presume its not your first rodeo, and as such many will want an answer asap. If thats the case, spend a little extra money and get the digital OPKs and a 3 pack of First Response tests."
3,Hard to Read,"I ordered these because they seemed to be a great value; however, I found the ovulation tests difficult to read. I was never really sure whether I was seeing a positive reading on the ovulation tests. I feel like I ""wasted"" several months of trying to get pregnant and not really being sure whether I was timing it right. If you are trying to get pregnant quickly, I would recommend paying more for the ClearBlue Easy Ovulation tests and knowing for sure."
4,Ovulation and Pregnancy test strips,"I normally buy the combo pack by Wofundo, but I decided to switch it up and buy these because they looked different in the picture... they are the same as the Wofundo ones, they are not green and dark blue, like in the picture they have. They seem to work fine, easy to use, easy to read."
3,So so,So last month none of the ovulation detectors worked I tried 6. I know when I ovulated because I had my ovaries scanned. This month just for the heck of it I tried another LH strip and it worked so I guess it's hit or miss. I did use afternoon urine this month instead of first morning urine. Who knows.
5,One of the largely forgotten great novels,"George Sand's Indiana dramatizes and explores a wide variety of concerns in the nineteenth century with a brilliance one rarely finds in a first novel: Arranged marriages, what it means to be a Creole, colonialism and plantation profiteering, slavery, the beginnings of the deterioration of Old Europe, and the rise of the businessman. In terms of narrative style, this may be one of the most unique novels I have read. The use of narrator to facilitate multiple endings is ingenious as well as baffling. Once you get to the end and discover who the narrator is or could be, you will likely want to re-read the novel, and voila! It's like experiencing the novel for the first time. It is a very rare talent indeed to create one novel for a first reading and a second novel for a second reading. It's a mystery to me how Sand has lost much of her notoriety. This novel is far superior than most you will find anywhere and in any language."
4,"Romance, Intrigue and A Happy Ending",This is the first I have novel I have read from Sand and I really liked it. Indiana is told from a narrator who we don't find out who it is until later on in the novel. Which makes for an interesting read because as the narrator tells the story and gets into the characters there is a distance and yet the character's give their thoughts too. It is unlike anything I have ever read.Indiana will keep you guessing as it has lots of twist and turns in the novel and the ending will come as a complete surprise. It is pretty much a quick read and you will find yourself loving and hating all of the characters. Except Raymon he is just no good.If you have never read Sand before this is a good book to start with seeing as it is the first novel she wrote on her own.
4,Anthropology for Drug Geeks,A great look at a town profoundly affected by the psychadelic revolution and the way it changed the town and it's people
2,Missed The Mark,"Animals should have been a good ""Grade B"" horror flick, but it really never got interesting enough to make it worth seeing.The plot seemed interesting enough - No spoilers from me: The story revolves around a washed up football player who returns to his backwards hometown only to fall into a serious rut. Along comes a beautiful stranger who takes an interest in him, but she has a serious ulterior motive.What follows is a lot of sex, some fairly well done gore effects, a few weak fight scenes, and perhaps the cheesiest CGI special effects ever (seriously). The acting was on par with other low budget movies, but there were really no standouts to make this movie worth seeing again. This movie really moved slowly and the odd camera work and editing also made it difficult to watch.Not Recommended.CFH"
2,Is it real?,"I bought this flat iron to replace an older 2"" chi that was still working. I noticed that the iron does not get as hot as my older one. Also, the chi name has totally rubbed off the iron, something that has never happened to my older iron(4 years old) or those of my daughters. The name 'global beauty network' is also beginning to rub off the iron. I suspect this flat iron may not be an authentic Chi brand, but an imitation labeled as such? I wondered how I was able to buy the product so much cheaper than other sites."
2,FAKE,I purchased this CHI straightening iron to replace the one I've had for the last 7 or 8 years until I accently dropped it. This is definitely a fake and it nothing like the real thing. It looks like it but the quality isn't the same- the light blinks differently and the heat isn't as good. It's probably better than a Conair or Remington but it's no comparison to an actual CHI
1,I think I bought an imitation CHI!,My CHI model GF 1001 didn't even last one year! The plates are chipping and now I need to buy a new one. I wasn't aware that I bought a knock-off last year until I started searching for a new CHI and read the reviews. Very disappointed!
1,Expensive...but SO cheap!,"Bought this for my wife. She loved it...until it broke, 6 months later. Disgusting that we spent so much money on this ""amazing"" product. Once again, you pay for the name, and that's it!"
