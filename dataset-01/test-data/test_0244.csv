3,Question need answer.,Is there any body known the soundtrack to this movie? Is it in any of Patrick Doyle's work collection?
3,NUDITY OVERPOWERS ALL,"Boy, does Heather Graham have a great pair of mammary glands. The rest of her body is in no bad shape either. Unfortunately, a naked Heather Graham has the tendency to over power the content of this film. Much like J.D. Salinger's use of profanity in Catch In The Rye diverted his readers' attention away from the actual story so it is here. Which is too bad because this is an interesting suspense story. I should have seen the twist coming a mile away; but I didn't and neither did others I have discussed this movie with. But no matter. This film is condemned to be remembered for a smiling Heather Graham with her naked breasts."
4,"Pretty good, but not all that I'd heard about it","I liked it well enough, but I'd heard some hype about it and that was over rated. I was looking for something like ""Secretary"", and this falls short. It still a very good movie and well worth watching. I enjoyed it and it kept my attention. It's got some great twists, but if you're looking for something mainstream kinky, this isn't it."
2,Not a great one by any stretch,Sometimes one will watch a movie just to see how it ends. This is one of those movies where you don't have to do that as most folks with an IQ above 30 will have the ending correctly guessed by half an hour into the movie.The leads give it a go here but the plot doesn't do them any favors as it is never presents believable characters or situations. The London scenery and Graham give the viewer a little to watch as the trite tale unfolds. It's not a bomb but 2 stars is all it deserves.
4,GREAT BOOTS...THUS FAR!,"Boots came extremely fast!!! Packaging was a bit large, but nothing that was out of the ordinary. I did NOT purchase the military grade boots, so these DO require a bit of break-in time. The steel toe survived a 90 lb box dropped on it with no cracking on the first day, so that alone makes me happy! I am a bit concerned concerning the lack of stitching holing the base to the main part of the boot, but if they hold for a year, it is money well spent! I will update this review in a few months."
3,daz you can do better,sad when a good producer like daz has to take the funk out the g funk and get crunk or snap with the dirty south to sell records and jd still dropped him sorry but daz needs to make more of that uncut chit we expect from dpg this isn't a bad record though it's okay. jagged edge is out of their element here just like jd and avery storm.
3,WORTH A VIEWING,"I recently bought 'All The Right Moves' on DVD after not seeing this film for a good number of years. And I must say I recommend this film, it's worth a viewing and I think one will even return and want to view it again. Tom Cruise is classic, he does what he does best-his likability. Lea Thompson is adorable and a talented actress as always. Worth the buy!by Justine ryan!"
3,Just a Cruise film for teenagers,"The Polish kid in a steal town wants to get out by playing footballand become an engineer.There are sex scenes with Lea Thompson, besides drama with the coach,but it just isn't a very originalor inspiring film ( Cruise did sport films better later?)."
4,Tom Cruise + Lea Thompson= Great viewing,You get to see Tom Cruise before he exploded and Lea Thompson like you will never see her again. Add Craig T. Nelson as coach Nickerson (what a stetch) and you can't help but have a very good movie. The plot is pretty predictable with a couple sad twists. The only thing I was disappointed in was there were not as many football scenes as I would like. But anybody who grew up in a blue-collar small town where football was king will appreciate this show.
1,HEATER STINKS!!!!!!!!!,received pelonis heater from amazon promptlyhad read reviews one in particular about smell when heater is on.I SHOULD HAVE HEEDED THE INFO.i used it in an RV now the rv smells terrible like burnt plastic.sent email to seller but as of two days no replyi have ran the heater for up to 6hrs on high trying to burn out the smell with no luck yetBUYER BEWARE.... heater heats excellent but stinks up your habitat.
1,What a waste,"This is probably the worst DVD I ever bought! Nelson doesn't sing the songs, he just talks them and seems to have no energy at all!"
2,Music for Elevators,"Mantovani has gained a reputation in some quarters for producing ""beautiful"" orchestral versions of standard pop songs; in others, his arrangements have been compared to ""elevaor music"" - the kind of material once used in institutional settings like malls, elevators, and dentist's offices. In short, we have lifeless, bloodless cover versions of pop standards that by themselves have been regarded with disdain by many listeners.This impressive compilation contains a bounty of those sweet violins and voices in a style that has long since passed its usefulness. The best moments are campy and unintentionally funny, as when Mantovani attempts ""contemporary"" hits by Nillson his ilk. This is orchesetral music for people who have never benefitted from a grounding in the classics. Compared even to outfits like Sounds Orchestral, the sound is drab and musty. It's hard to imagine anybody listening to this kind of thing anymore."
5,This was a Christmas gift,We love Madagascar movies so I chose this as a gift for my niece. She was pleased I remembered that she liked the penguins.
2,"As described, but has not attracted the mouse.","I put these blocks out three days ago where there is known mouse activity, and so far it appears to not even have gotten a nibble."
5,My review of Collector's Guide to Pocket Calculators...,"This book is amazing. As a collector and researcher, I have not found any other book that comes close to the information you can find in this ""Collector's Guide to Pocket Calculators."" It is great as a quick reference to models and types, as well as lots of fun just to sit and read about all the different variations on a theme. Great photos! Lots of work went into this and it shows. Great job. -- Mark Greeni"
1,CRASH,"THIS DVD WAS SURE NOT WORTH THE MONEY. NOT UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO WATCH A VIDEO OF A PILE OF JUNK FOR AN HOUR ON TV. WAS CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED WITH IT. THE DVD CALLED ""MAYDAY, MAYDAY"". WAS EXCELLENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH."
1,Not strong enough,"The strips have enough magnetic power to hold themselves up and not much more. I tried to used them to hold a piece of thin foil against an air duct with no success at all, even when then entire perimeter was covered with these sticks."
4,Welcome to the Brotherhood,A fun read... Kathryn Smith creates a wonderful world to fall into with engaging characters and a heroine you can relate to. I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of the Brotherhood of the Blood universe.
1,Dont do Business with Yes Video,The WORST company to deal with. I usually do not write reviews but this company is bad. Your better of dealing with any other company or product than this one. Their service is terrible. No response by phone or e-mail.
5,IT rolls,This album can play all night.Burton's voice is strong and clear. His large range is still to be found. Enjoy the album
4,Burton still has it.,"Burton performs a lot of his old Guess Who songs, along with a few from his solo career. His voice is as good as ever, as his playing. Why not five stars? I can't help comparing the Guess Who songs to the Guess Who versions. Their songs were, and are, the best."
2,Just couldn't listen to it....,"I was excited when this album first came out, but didn't keep it for long. For some reason, the iconic Canadian singer/songwriter/pianist was going through a phase with so many annoying vocal ticks -- throwing in ya ya's on songs, etc. -- that it ruined the experience, especially as there is no music besides his piano work to distract you.Indeed, when ""Runnin' Back Thru Canada"", the double CD live reunion album by Burton's band The Guess Who, came out a few years ago I hesitated to buy it for this very reason. But relax; the strange vocal mannerisms were gone and that package is brilliant. I'd buy it over Up Close and Alone."
3,"USEFUL BOOK, BUT NOT THE BEST","I enjoyed the kits in this book, and the expanded rules on the proficiencies are good. For example, it has advanced rules on running an armorery or weaponsmithing business.However, the combat rules and most of the other stuff in the book is pretty [undesirable]."
4,Great Book,I highly recommend this book as a must read. The storyline was exceptional and the characters were so real. The steamy sex scenes were mindblowing. I can't wait to read another book by Mr. Luckett.
4,vote is still out,I just got this a few days ago. I also ordered DrEmu for my face. So it is nice I can kind of compare the 2 products at least on how it looks.This one is more of an oil greasy feel than the DrEmu. So I am using this one (which is less expensive) on my body parts and DrEmu on my face and neck only.I possibly put too much on my face?? But my skin doesn't seem to absorb it as well as the DrEmu.The oil inside of Thunder's bottle is like a thin creamy lotion. So I spreads out nice for large body parts.Won't know how well it works for a couple of months. Husband is also trying on hair line too. I am also putting on son's dermitis on back of arms. So we will see!
4,how can you go wrong with a 4 year lod boy and trains,"I gave it four stars, not because it wasn't a nice book just that it isn't one of my son's go to books. Great photos and info!"
3,"Not bad, but much smaller than I thought","The book is fairly small (less than letter size) and thin (around 25 pages). I purchased it for my 3 years old son, he enjoys the drawings but he is too young to enjoy the information in the text. If you are looking for a big book with a lot of pictures this is not waht you want."
3,A Fun Weekend Read!,"I found ""Weekend in Paris"" to be a fun light read that really falls into the new genre of ""chick lit."" This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Sisman and I thought that she managed to perfectly combine French ideals as well as English ideals into a very clever read.Molly Clearwater was a great character and I found her escapades to be fun. She was not a wishy-washy character but rather a strong person who was able to make the most of her weekend in Paris.I do agree though with one former reviewer with the fact that I was also a little let down by the part of the storyline that revolved around her finally finding her father. I felt as if we were left hanging. Why bring it up if there was not going to be any follow through???? Other wise this was a light read and a fun way to pass the weekend."
3,It's okay for a quick read,"I call these types of books ""Bubblegum for the Brain."" This one, in particular, is not a great book - but it is good for the genre. I read it before bed in two nights, but the last couple chapters were hard to get through.The book is quite predictable. It is a little too much so, with regards to the mysterious texts she gets from ""a friend"" and whatnot.I will say that I feel like the author had formal training writing. The reason? Well, when you learn to write, you're told to use a lot of descriptors to make someone feel as if they are in a particular place. Unfortunately, there were soooo many descriptors that I mostly skimmed through them whenever I felt she was about to go on and on and on...Sadly, this happened in almost every circumstance.Still, if you're looking for a beach read or a quick book for a long flight, don't count this one out. There are a few mildly steamy parts which I warmly welcomed (and didn't expect)."
2,Not a good read...,"This is my first read for Robyn Sisman`s book. And I didn`t really enjoyed it but I don`t hate it that much... I was captured by the front cover of the book.. what did they say about don`t judge a book by its cover.. I should have known better... The story plot was to be something like a cinderella kind.. pissed off with boss, went to romantic captial city Paris & life turns in favour for the girl.. A handsome french hopelessly in love with her... Had the best days of her life in a weekend in paris.. The story just sounds too sweet to be true. It could be a suitable to just kill time but didn`t left much of an impression after it has been read. Didn`t live up the value of the hardback. Should have waited for the paperback."
2,You Know What's Going to Happen Before You Even Read the Book,"A young woman is thrilled to be chosen by her boss to accompany him to Paris for a business trip, but she is devastated to learn he has ulterior motives. (Wanna guess what these are? Yep, just what you thought.) She quits her job and decides to go to Paris anyway. Of course she meets a handsome Frenchman and of course there is heartbreak and of course she learns not to be so naive and of course she meets a nice person who offers her a better job and of course everything turns out okay in the end"
3,Fun Read,"I enjoyed this a little treat after reading a heavy political book. Very fun little adventure, expecially for those like me who romanticize Paris beyond it's potential."
2,a weekend? 3 days that feel like 3 months!,The book started off good. It was funny and exciting and a good read....then somewhere in the middle i found myself checking how many pages were left until the ending and was dissapointed to see that there were still more then a hundred.unfortunately i never finshed the book. it was long and boring and her weekend felt like an enternity. entirely too mcuh stuff happened to her in a three day period. and she turned out to be a bit og a ding batjust my personal opinion
2,Not worth your time,This book had potential....but was so overdescriptive it was almost unbearable. Could barely stand to read it. Do yourself a favour and don't.
4,Clear message - live life!,"I was genuinely smiling when I finished reading this book! (Though, I cried at one part, I won't say which part...). A Weekend in Paris, is a romantic novel with a message, ""To live life to the fullest, to take chances, to have wild/crazy unplanned adventures."" Though, I didn't really like Molly's character (way too naive), I fell in love with the spirit that Alicia added to the novel. She's bold, courageous, and not afraid of having fun."
2,Not So Great,This book was almost painful to read at times. I cringed at some of the main characters actions.
4,12 in 1 flash memory card reader,A very useful card reader that does exactly as advertised. Only drawback is a somewhat fussy insertion slot for Pro Duo cards.
4,does the job,"I only have SD, Smart and Transflash (using SD adaptor). The reader does what it's suppose to do for these cards. Only complaint is that the light on the reader stay on ALL THE TIME and it's so bright I can almost use it as a night light."
1,More Form Than Function (Pins Easily Bend),I'm always weary of people who are quick to give an item 5 stars and not truly give it a run for its money. This card reader is more form than function. I purchased it because we do allot of re-formatting. You can not be quick about inserting the cards and after a short period the pins can become bent making it difficult for the unit to recognize or read the card satisfactorily... I found the SimpleTech & Dazzle PCI Slot Card Readers to be a much better tool by far for our Laptopstrzrtree
4,Portable and handy,"It does topple over easily when bumped. Internal card readers stay out of the way and aren't as clumsy. But this USB card reader can travel with us when we go on trips and want to share with others. And when others visit us, they can share.Even after being bumped many times it still works like a charm."
2,False Advertising,Pictured item is not what you get in the mail. Item I received was a shiny black 12 in 1 reader with a flimsy magnet base to stabilize the reader on hard surfaces. It works great but didn't receive the exact item in the picture.
5,This is a very handy reader if you use more than one kind of card.,"I'm a Graphics Designer and Photographer, and at work other people often bring me their various cards with images for me to upload. With this ImageMate, I can just put in their card and push a button and the files are quickly put in one folder for me on my computer. I've created a shortcut to that folder in my Adobe Bridge (others could put a shortcut on their desktop) to quickly access my newly loaded images."
3,Worked great until it broke,I was pretty happy with the reader until the socket broke that connects the cradle with the actual reader. Probably just a manufacturing defect but it left me with a sour aftertaste.
2,You get what you pay for,"I was somewhat disappointed with these scissors, but what can you expect at that price? The quality was so-so, the cutting action only fair. Time to upgrade to a better, more professional pair. I don't think my hairdresser would use these scissors, the cutting action was off."
3,Not fast enough for Video shooting,"I never thought I could have this problem but when I shoot movies with my Canon SD400 under high settings (30 fps, 640*320) it often shows a red exclamation mark beside the minutes and stopped working quickly after. Now I know why-- it's the SD card that's not fast enough. If I change to a lower setting that never happens again. But why do you want to sacrifice your video quality? Get a better one instead!"
5,Fine product,Although I ended up returning it and getting a shorter one. You'll want a 14 foot ceiling to use this. I miscalculated when I didn't take the length of the fan itself into account; that made the fan about 10 inches too low.
5,Wow!!!,"This movie is pre-code at its best. Myrna Loy has some real zinger lines, and you just love her character. Warner Baxter is good, but I wish the male lead had been William Powell. Don't miss this one!!!"
3,Good but not good enough,The book is good but it won't get you through the Foundation exam by it's self. It was weak on networking and TCP/IP and don't rely on it for the HTML section. It covered Copy Right and security well though.A good starting point but boost it with extra reading
2,Good for the novice,"Be careful, if you already have some knowledge about the internet and computers, shy away. It was written in such a basic way, it was hard to get into the book. Too much fluff for someone who has some knowledge, just need to get the rest of the story and then move on. If this sounds like you, don't get this book. If you don't know what a modem is, get this book. It's a good start."
5,If you have a boy who loves trains ... this book is it!,Great illustrations and a lovely story of a boy's dream of his fixing and then riding on his toy train.
3,Hear no Eno,"Eno's film work generally tends to showcase recording over artist, impressing more with production finesse and tonal clarity than anything composed on the paper. For ambient enthusiasts, Eno's impression on the medium could never be overstated, and therefore even scraps can yield impressive audio processing techniques. Casual fans however will want to dip into more popular waters first to decide if these murky, half-brilliant depths deserve plunging."
1,JUNK!,"Bought this at Walmart for $16. Right out of the box I found problems. It won't work! Initially I had to turn the speed to 6 (highest) for it to start spinning. After a couple of uses, it won't work at all. So there I was trying to bake...and this piece of junk failed. I had to stop working and run to the store to return it and get a new one. I told my sis ""It's a Hamilton Beach"" and she said ""No wonder...the worse brand ever!"". I've learned my lesson--never buy Hamilton Beach again."
4,a good product for the money,"i had purchased some very expensive pots but as we all know, they never come in all the sizes you need. i searched everywhere for open stock that was affordable since my fortune was already spent. these filled the bill. i got the 4, 6, and 8 quart. they are exactly as described. they aren't as heavy as analon or the other very expensive products but they are more than adequate. i would not hesitate to get more of them."
5,Watched again and again,"Anne of Green Gables is a classic that no little girl should grow up without seeing. After buying this my wife and daughter have watched it over and over again. The first two DVDs with Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea are fantastic. The third video, the continuing story, is ok, but doesn't have the same feeling as the books or the first two movies. All in all, I felt it was well worth getting."
2,Quality is poor,"Service in receiving product was excellent, however the quality of the DVDs is rather poor and disappointing considering what I paid for them."
5,Among the Ten Best Ever Films!,"There was nothing like sitting with my children, and now with my grandchildren, and watching them become enraptured by the wonders of what I consider to be collectively ""one"" of the ten best films ever made. Yes, in terms of overall quality, the Anne of Green Gables Trilogy ranks up there with Ben Hur, Dances With Wolves, The Sound of Music, and the other classics. In fact, even at 69 years old, whenever I feel as if I need some inspiration, or I feel others I love do as well, into the DVD player goes Anne! As others have attested, one will never feel embarrassed by watching or having others watch these wonderful, wholly inspirational films."
5,Know Your Flowers By Name,"This guide helps Texans (and visitors to Texas) to identify the common and rare flowers seen along the roadsides and in the pastures, fields, and forests of the state. Also included among the pages are 381 full-color, close up photos and 370 species including a description of its appearance, range, habitat, and blooming season.Texas is famous for its bluebonnets, and they are a sight to see in the spring! This book shows how many more lovely flowers decorate the state. My favorite is seeing red indian paint accenting a swath of bluebonnets. Stunning.Get this book to learn the names of all the flowers."
3,Not as good as Wildflowers of Texas,The biggest problem with this field guide is it's organization and it is much harder to use than the color coded Wildflowers of Texas. The photographs are not as good either.
4,""" most significant artists of the past century""","ABC formed in 1980 after Martin Fry interviewed Vice Versa guitarist Mark White and saxophonist Stephen Singleton for his fanzine. Under the direction of Martin Fry, the group scored several catchy, synth-driven dance-pop hits including ""POISON ARROW"", ""THE LOOK OF LOVE"" and ""BE NEAR ME"". The major factor in ABC's success was its stylish videos in the early days of MTV and ""THE BEST OF ABC"" includes the theme from its 1982 music video collection ""THEME FROM MANTRAP"".One of the biggest hits was in 1987 with the pop-soul Motown tribute ""WHEN SMOKEY SINGS"" from Alphabet City. More adventurous than most, ABC was one of the more popular purveyors of perfect pop. Highly recommend this ""best of"" album from the most significant music artists of the past century.Total Time: 45:06 on 11 Tracks/ Mercury Records - 314 542 459 2 (2000)"
5,solo poppy seed paste,"I have used this product before with excellent results.My husband worked in the retail grocery business for 50 years, so this product is not new to me.It has always been a very popular item with consumers. I was very happy to find this product on amazon at an excellent price. Eileen"
2,Undependable!,"This headset worked fine for the first week, after which, it started acting up. It would dial the last number even when I am on the phone with someone. Very aggravating!!! The sound is good. Although the price is remarkable, please consider buying something more valuable that will work well for a prolonged period."
1,"Sadly, mine was defective","The first time I used it, I discovered it was defective. Maybe not all of them are but this one definatly was. As soon as I received it, I called my sister to test it out. On my end there was crackling and she couldn't hear me well at all. I kept having to repeat myself. Realizing it was useless, I immediatly returned it. I'm Still waiting for my refund."
1,Stay Clear,"Listen to the others. It's a piece of junk. No one can hear the you becauase of the poor quality microphone. I bought it, tried it, trashed it. Save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere."
2,Motorola Razr V3 Headset,"I ordered two sets. The first two sets did not work at all( you can hear the caller but the caller can't hear you). After complaining to Amazon (complaining to the vendor got no response), the vendor sent me two new sets that worked.The sets that did not work were silver in color with thin calbes.The sets that work are black in color and have thicker cables."
1,Non-functional,Returned this headset to Amazon after five minutes of testing. The volume just wasn't there. I have normal hearing and could not make out anything the person at the other end of the line said.
2,Basic headset,"This is the most basic headset I could find since I didn't want to spend an arm & a leg for a Bluetooth headset. Pluses: cheap, sounds good, did I say cheap? Minuses: The clip is junk and actually damaged the wire before it fell off, the earpiece is too big, the mic picks up every sound in the area. There is also a really weird feedback using the ""mute"" on the phone and the headset.It's better than nothing but you might come out better plunking down the change to get a Bluetooth headset."
4,Hands Free Headset,"Nice product, comfortable for the ear, the volume is also good you can hear the other person. Yes, would purchase again."
3,Acceptable,Wanted a wired ear piece and paid .01 cents for this one. Other reviews of awkward in the ear are right on. I solved this by looping over my ear and then into the left ear. Clarity is very good. Great solution if you do not want blue tooth to kill your battery. B
1,It's a piece of junk,Guess Motorola used some of its best brains to make Razr V3 phone and asked its worst (brains) to design an headset for it. By far the worst headset one could ever make. They have set the benchmark for how worse a headset can be.
1,Not fit for teens,The language is atrocious. I definitely wouldn't use this un my classroom. I am not sure why it is necessary to use filthy language to get a point across...good authors have been doing it for years.
2,"The potential for an amazing story, but...","I hope -- and suspect -- that even as a (target market) young adult I would have been as unsatisfied with this book as I was after reading it as an adult. It's laughable and ludicrous to compare this book to the likes of Susanna Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted or Augusten Burroughs's Running with Scissors simply because they share some basic similarities. The story itself, the event, has the potential to really knock a reader's socks off, but is told in such an artless and stumbling manner it makes it difficult to want to continue reading, and especially difficult to connect at all with the humans behind it. I didn't find it ""refreshingly normal"" and certainly not ""scary"", as some other reviewers have credited; I found it boring, course and overall disappointing. I've read better straight out of my junior high students' journals."
3,Well...,"Like ""A Child Called It"" and other harrowing memoirs, this book can be appreciated more for its content, which is self-explanatory, than its writing style, which is amateurish. This makes the book a bit irritating at times, but the story is so good that I'll keep reading anyway. (Haven't even finished the book yet!)"
5,Incredible illustrations in a touching story.,Catalanotto's illustrations bring so much depth to this story of a child missing his father. His use of overlapping images to show the passage of time is beautiful. A moving book to have and treasure.
2,pretty much expensive chapstick...,"Seems like a nice, moisturizing balm. It's a little ""claustrophobic"" feeling on your lips: thick and petroleum-like, not something I would call ""sheer"". And though it comes in what sound like colors, like sheer burgundy, it dissapointingly adds NO color whatsoever, and virtually no shine. I'm sure it will be a decent, protective balm for the winter, especially to put on at night or outdoors in the wind. But I could've gotten the same results from original chapstick.Also, the vendor charges 4.99 on Amazon, but left their 2.99 store price slapped on the bottom of the jar. Not exactly something that gives a customer the warm fuzzies. I won't be buying any more."
5,Adorable,"This clock came fast and is so cute for my daughters room, it does the normal function of showing the time and having an alarm but it also has a demo button that plays parts of the classic cinderella song dream, it also projects stars on the ceiling when you press the projection button. My daughter just knows shes a princess so she loves it"
4,Interesting background information on popular sixties shows,"I must confess, I wish there had been more time spent on Time Tunnel, which was the shortest lived of Irwin Allen's shows, but should have had the longest run. I also enjoyed seeing James Darren in The Man From the Twenty-fifth Century, a demonstration film, which never aired and is admittedly only 17 minutes long. I wish it had been fleshed out into a TV movie starring James Darren. The parts with Jonathan Harris were fun too."
2,Not for the computer impared,"The code in the descriptions is so small that it has to be read with a magnifying glass. The quality of print is not such that all of the characters can be recconized even with the magnifying glass. The companion web site does not exhist per Premier Press. Generally, this book is worthless once you have php, and mysql loaded and that can be done with much better quality publications."
3,"Good Anklet, but arrived tarnished","The ankle is good for the price but needed some elbow grease to make it shine. It arrived a bit on the tarnished side, but not bad enought to send back. Good value for the dollar. Thanks"
1,Medicore and less than thorough.,"This is a reasonable, but not a strong book. Interesting cases are discussed, but their review is far from thorough."
4,Nice gift or travel reader...but wished,I would have purchased the workbook.*Four stars only if you can get past the colored glossy pages.
5,Awesome,great book... i have shared it with others. this is my favorite publication from Louise's work. Wish everyone would read it.
5,Will help on Healing Journey,"Louise L. Hay took the proverbial lemons and made lemonade out of them. She made beauty out of ashes, she truly turned her life around. And, having done so, she shares with the world how we can accomplish healing also. Ms. Hay is an inspiration. Someone had given me a copy of this book about 12 years ago. At the time I was not ready for all this what I called ""hocus-pocus"" back then. But because of a class I am taking for holistic healing, I had to purchase this book use as part of a research paper. I am so glad that I did, because this edition is even more beautiful than the original one I had. For those on the healing path, this is a definite buy. Keep in mind though that she is coming from a metaphysical perspective and that such things as a virus do come from sources other than ourselves."
5,You Can Heal Your Life,"And you can heal your life, with the help of this book and some effort on your part. A wonderful read that you don't have to read all at once. Very simple and very profound excercises you can do yourself to heal. I highly recommend this book if you want to make some serious and positive changes in your life and don't have thousands of dollars to spend on therapy!"
2,Total crap!,"At the insistance of an online ""New Age"" friend, I picked up this book. And it's awful. I have tried to read it about 10 times in the last five years. It amounts to GARBAGE. Louise L. Hay has built herself a nice little empire out of this nonsense. She regurgitates the same information in nearly every book and CD. This book will NOT heal your life; get a therapist and psychotropic medication!!! Louise L. Hay is not qualified to help us! (Two stars 'cause the pictures are pretty!!!)"
3,Keep an Open Mind when reading this book,"It's good to keep an open mind when reading this book. As Ms. Hay delves into the spiritual so born again's may not appreciate it. Lot's of good info, if you can get past some of her beliefs that you may not share.Still in all, it seems to be a positive book with good intent."
5,Enlightning!,"I enjoyed the movie and each time I watch it I pick up on something else. It's interesting to watch these principals put into a movie form ""Like real life""."
5,Perfect,I absolutely love this book...it's beautifully illustrated and has changed my life. I would highly recommend that everyone have a copy! Don't wait until you have something wrong to read it!
4,You Can Heal Your Life,How can you go wrong with Louise Hay? This book is a classic and it was great to have a DVD too. I found some of the writing style a bit antiquated but all in all a great book.
3,Great Book but DVD Faulty,"I enjoyed the book but the DVD did not work, so I am only giving 3 stars as I can't really rate the benefits of listening to the DVD etc.. I didn't try to listen to it before the expiration of returning items, my fault for assuming the product would work. Just a note of warning, if you buy this box set try the DVD out immediately. I spend a lot of time in my car and was really looking forward to listening to this as I found the book very, very good."
5,Awesome Book,I consult this book for everything. The information and reasoning for illness is so accurate. Great tool for life! :)
5,Very empowering,Beautiful page design makes this book visually appealing as well as being incredibly hard to put down. Very empowering and sets tasks to help you initiate positive changes you want in your life
1,Agreed: It's not as simple as she makes out,"Last night I opened this book, and the author says that children who need glasses have bad eyesight because ""there is something in their household they don't want to see."" And I was so disgusted by her idiocy I couldnt take the rest of the book seriously. However I do think psychology can affect you physically. If that point was made more reasonably and without this sense of absolutism, the book would be far more valuable. Stress does make you tired and more susceptible to illness. Yes, unhappiness adds tension and pain to your back. But a virus is a virus, not some cosmic force punishing you for not being comfortable with yourself.Sadly, I would guess that a lot of doctors are quick to prescribe drugs rather than more homeopathic/psychological/placebo options because they are worried about this slippery slope into, ""take your kids glasses away and tell them to cheer up!"""
5,A great way to look at things in a whole new light!,"This book is excellent! The way she puts things in a new perspective for me, changed my whole outlook on things. From work to play...I'm a much happier and ""sane"" person for having read this book. I would encourage every single person to read this. But it's more than just reading too, you have to believe in what she is saying. Once you read this, you'll see what I mean. Happy Reading!"
3,Wouldn't recommend,"I really wouldn't recommend this book as a self-help book. it is kind of all over the place and wishy-washy. If it is your first self-help book, then maybe it could be a good start but if you've read several you probably will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the things that she says make sense but I found that the book was not focused enough. For instance, she introduces an idea without really going into it enough. However, if you believe that physical illnesses are caused by a negative state of mind then this is probably the book for you. She goes into great detail about this."
3,Not for everyone,"This is an inspirationally written (and beautifully produced and illustrated) book which has helped many people. Louise Hay teaches that ""whatever we think about ourselves becomes the truth for us."" She believes that many illnesses, including some normally considered purely physical, can be overcome by the exercise of the will. Some of the conditions she talks about need regular medical treatment and her ideas could lead to rejecting needed medical care. I think the book may be most useful to sufferers from conditions that are at least partly under the control of the will, such as obesity, anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep disturbances and addictions."
4,School Study,This DVD does go along with our textbook story used in our English class. The students said it also helped them to visualize the story much better. They especially enjoyed the DVD being shown immediately before Halloween. The time frame of the DVD works well in our 42 minute class leaving enough time for a brief introduction and necessary closure.
3,Kindle formatting is horrible!,"I am really enjoying the study. I would recommend it, HOWEVER, the formatting on the Kindle is very poor, hence the 3 star rating."
4,A fine western collection,"An excellent price/value combination, with three rare titles of good, solid westerns, never before published in America on DVD and with such high video technical quality.The extras are relatively abundant and very interesting.A must have for every serious classic westerns collector."
3,Good for the Price,"At $10.99, this package is well worth it. None of these movies are classics, but they are pretty solid. I had seen all of them in my youth. ""The Gunfighter"" has held up the best. ""Garden of Evil"" is better than I remembered, and ""Rawhide"" not quite as good. Gary Cooper is equal to himself in ""Garden of Evil."" Gregory Peck shows that he really was the best actor of his generation. He does an excellent job with a ""not really a good guy"" role. Although I like Tyrone Power, he just doesn't quite cut it in ""Rawhide."" It may be a script problem because his character just doesn't seem very defined."
5,One of the best westerns ever,"My favorite western and it was overdue for a DVD release. Gregory Peck is at his best and Karl Malden is great as the local bartender. Helen Westcott is superb as Peck's leading lady, but the finest performance was probably Millard Mitchell as Marshal Mark Strett. Not to be missed by either Peck or western fans."
4,"Good ""After Bicycle Ride"" Replenishment","I often use Powerbar Recovery immediately after a hard bicycle ride. It prevents a drained and hungry feeling from the exercise for about 90 minutes until I have time to eat solid food. I think, but have no way of proving, that the next day my muscles have recovered quicker than when I do not drink the recovery mix. I'm sure there are other supplements that will have a similar effect, but this is the one I prefer. I often mix with whey protein and supplements. I also prefer the orange flavor."
5,Be My Girl: Greatist Love Song/Dramatics,"These guys are the great.Back in the day around the Seventies, these guys came out with some of the best hits. I listen to at least one or two of their songs on a daily basis"
2,Not very realistic...,"Let's see....you divorce your wealthy husband for beaating you up but when your 8-year-old son comes home from school with a big 'ol black eye on two different occasions and a note from the principle stating he's been in a fight, you do nothing about it? You don't ask the kid what happened? Don't call the principle for more information. Dont' march right down to the school and demand to know who's beating up your kid? Well, this author lost me right there. You don't let your kid go around getting beat-up without doing something about it. Plus the fact that other basic things don't match up as well - like the fact that the main character, Goldy, is flat-out broke and running her catering business on a very thin string, but has enough money to have a gym membership to which she can add her niece - well, it just doesn't work for me. Plus the writing is erratic and Goldy isn't very likeable to begin with."
4,A nice 'cozy' mystery,I am a recent fan of the 'cozy' mystery. This was an enjoyable book. A nice mystery without any over the top gore or bad language. I look forward to reading her next book.
1,"Rude charactrers, lame humor","I hate to say it, but I did not like this book. The characters are rude and unlikable for the most part, and her attempt at humor didn't do it for me. I would recommend skipping this one and reading Selma Eichler, Janet Evanovich, or Mariah Stewart instead."
4,Davidson Books A Pleasure,"This was the first Davidson book I read, and have since read her entire collection. I love her sense of family and home - she is always most relaxed when she is in the kitchen cooking. I have also tried several of her recipes and my husband praises her dishes! Light, entertaining, and a good murder mystery in each story. Enjoy-"
3,DIANE MOTT DAVIDSON,I enjoy the series very much and look forward to the new books as they come outthis one was a little weak or so i thought
4,Ms. Goldy's usual homerun,I have read most of the cooking detective's books...while formulaic I love yo see what mischief Goldy is going to get into..and its amazing how much she can eat!
4,Goldy is Great,"I wondered how this series with Goldy Bear would hold up. I had originally thought that Goldy was a Jewish caterer. My mistake! Goldy's real name is Gertrude and Goldilocks is the name she uses for her catering company. I truly enjoyed this mystery. I found it interesting how Goldy had to rely on other cleaning jobs when her catering business is temporarily shut down by accusations of poisoning. I know there's no way in hell I could ever clean up after other people. I have a hard enough time doing it for myself!I'd like to read more in this series. I'd like to hear more about her budding relationship with the cop, Tom. I like him. He's sarcastic and speaks his mind. Wonderful attributes in a man."
5,Sonny Boy Williamson,"Simply the best. This is a great collection of songs interpreted by the great, elegant, blues master, Mr. Sonny Boy Williamson II. One of my favorite CD's."
4,Sonny sings from the Soul!,Sonny lets the listener feel his emotions as the words and notes come from deep within his soul. Each note we hear carries with him the love of his music.
4,Great Intro to Women Blues,"Did you know that women were the first popular blues singers? Black Pearls explores the pioneering women who in the 20's changed the record instustry and music as we know it. Having read a few blues books by now, I found that portions in the introductory sections lacked the sort of awe-inspiring insight that makes for an excellent blues book. And my attention span had me skipping half-way through the chapter on lyrical analysis. Howvever, once I got to the sections that focus on the individual performers, this book excelled. There are many who seem hellbent on denying these particular women a hallowed place in the history of popular music (read Alan Lomax's brief dismissal of the classic blues era in his ""The Land Where the Blues Began""), but Harrison's prodigious biographical and musical insights really open the door to a greater appreciation of the women she features. As a companion, I might suggest the cd ""Classic Blues Women"" by Rhino Records."
1,A mistake from the start!,"This book in all accounts is a mistake. It is nothing but whinning for like 100 pgs. I wanted a good book with some facts. This was made up facts, and the same made up lines over and over. Along with this made up fact book, there are several grammer and spelling errors. Im sorry but it was just bad in every way something can be."
3,Okay,"It was okay, but NOT Creech's best. She could have done better than that. The characters had pretty good personilities. This is the 2nd Sharon Creech book."
4,Transitioning to a new school...,"This book was required reading for all of the 6th grade children who will start this school year at the new middle school. She said it was okay- ""it was interesting...enough."" This wasn't one she wanted to read, but saw the value in the story line of a girl beginning at a new school that she didn't want to attend...and then ended up liking the school so much she didn't want to leave. So I would recommend this book for other teachers or parents who want to open up discussion about changes and transitions...and then make them do character analysis, story map or another extension activity along with reading :)"
5,Bloomability,"This is the best book I've ever read, and believe me I've read a lot of books. I've read Bloomability like 5 times and it never ever gets old. Ever since I first read it, it made me want to go to that boarding school in Switzerland. That would be so great if everyone were REALLY treated equal. That would never happen at my school. Well anyway, everyone schould read it, because you can learn so much from this book. I don't want to give anything away, but I've been so much nicer to people than I used to and I always think about what would happen after the book. I wish Sharon Creech would make a sequal to it because it is the BEST BOOK EVER!!!!! Sharon Creech has been my favorite author since I was 8 and I'm 13 now and she still is! If I could, I'd give Bloomability a 10!"
5,Hurrah for Sharon Creech!,"This book is one of the best I have ever read. A combination of a teenager's life and feelings, and the adventure of living in a foreign country, it makes for a great read. This book describes exactly how I feel sometimes. It also has a great description of going to school in and international school. I presently go to one, and it amazes me how well Sharon Creech has captured the experience. I recommend this book to anyone who is or has been a teenager, or has gone to an international school. It's about a girl named Dinny who is ""forced"" to go to Switzerland with her Aunt and Uncle. Her uncle is the headmaster of an international school. Dinny goes to this school. She has a complaining, obnoxious friend named Lila, and a boy friend (not boyfriend) named Guthrie that is really close. She also has loads of other friends. Enjoy reading about Dinny and her school! It is a truly excellent book."
1,don't buy this product,I used this for less than a day. I got through two bags of apples before it broke.It also is very hard to get the apple slices out which is how i cut my finger on it.
2,"Good, but copywrighted - BEWARE","The list is awesome, but there was no mention before I purchased that ALL of the songs are copywrighted - yep, that's right... I don't know WHO would actually need 400 sounds for personal use, but I bought this to use in PROFESSIONAL projects, so it was a BIG dissapointment."
5,Southern history comes alive,"Regardless of the reader's politics, this volume offers an excellent preparation for celebrating the 4th of July. I really did not expect to finish the book, but after reading the first chapter, I could not put it down.It gave me a perspective of early history in Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. Schoolbooks tend to concentrate on Revolutionary activity centering in New England.Also, this book, unlike textbooks, portrays both good and bad characters on both sides of the war. This is one objective the author may have found easier to handle through a work of fiction.I recommend this book, not only for reading one time, but to include in your library for re-reading and reference."
3,Wonderfully researched,I love Jimmy Carter and want to salute him for writing fiction. I can't think of any other former US president who has done such a thing.What kills this book is not the research which is excellent but the people in the book which seem to be more like actors in a play then fictional characters. They speak as if they already know the outcome of the situation they find themselves in.The transitions from one scene to another are also painful to read but I could even ignore this if the book didn't have the tendency to good into history text book mode spoon feeding the reader perfectly self evident information which the characters never utilize.Overall-For all of its faults the book does make plain that which no one else wants to remember the Revolutionary War was never as simple as everyone would like to believe.
1,The worst book/historical fiction ever written,"Was I ever primed for this one. As a living historian who portrays the Southern campaign I could not wait for the book to arrive. It was obvious from Carter's Larry King interview he had read the right books, had a firm grasp on the salient issues and understood the long-overlooked importance of the Southern front. What he could not do was tell a story, write a passable piece of dialogue or engage his reader at all. It was in short a book as disasterous as his presidency. In fact, I am convinced were he not a former president, short of self-publishing, this could never have been printed. 134 used copies from as low as $4.59 right here on Amazon says it all."
3,Flawed but enjoyable,"I agree with some of the criticisms made by other reviewers who gave low reviews. The characterization tends to be shallow and inconsistent. The transitions between personal stories and historical accounts are jarring and sometimes frustrating. But, in spite of these problems, I still enjoyed the book. So, I feel three stars is appropriate. I learned a lot about the history of the Revolutionary War in the South and the people who lived through it and enjoyed learning about it in the context of fiction. Since such books are so rare (apparently this is the only one) these pluses alone made the book worth my time."
3,I give it a C+,"The Hornet's Nest will have a place in literary history because it is the first fiction book writen by a former president but the book is more than just a trivia entry. Hornet's Nest is a decent work of fiction. It's a little dull in places and no-one can compare this to John Jakes's stuff. People won't be reading it 40 years from now but that's okay. The book has sturdy, business like writing. Most of the details are correct. Carter doesn't try to make his hero sound like a 21rst century man and except for one silly mistake (Nobody wore trousers back then. Men wore breeches and they were always tight) it works. This isn't the greatest fiction I've read this year but it's far from the worst."
4,Absolutely worthwhile,"Okay, I'll admit this is not the greatest novel I have ever read. I agree that it's not likely to win any prizes for literature. Nevertheless, it passed the three most important tests of a good read:1) I learned a lot reading it;2) I could not put it down but was disappointed to finish it;3) It was three-dimensional, meaning that I felt like I was a part of the action, not watching it on a TV screen.This very good book helps fill a very large void in our understanding of the Revolutionary War in the South. More important, it sensitively explores the ambiguities of war, loyalty, and patriotism."
2,A painful read...,Love Jimmy Carter but I wish he would have put his years of research on the subject into a non-fiction work.Genuinely wretched dialog.
2,What a bore!,Jimmy Carter cannot write fiction! His conversations are formal and lecturing. His main fictional character has no passion. This should have been a history book. The sections dealing in the pure history were interesting and informative although I did tend to lose track of which side he was talking about.
2,"Toshiba usually reliable, not in this case","My positive experiences with Toshiba in the past is what lead me to purchase this specific brand DVD player. My family and I went on two vacations within the last month and this was purchased for my children to watch their movies during the plane rides. Immediately out of the box the DVD player functioned very loudly when loading a DVD, making a grinding/grunting noise. It did have a beautiful picture on the LCD screen, however. The player only lasted about 3 weeks and stopped working during our return flights from our second vacation. It didn't even last one month! I would avoid purchasing this item again because, even when working, it took forever to load DVD's and was very loud when doing so. Not to mention that if you have problems with the unit, you have to send it to Toshiba for service and cannot return it to the vendor you purchase if from, which is a significant inconvenience."
1,Went through 2 units with skipping problems,"The one star is for battery life. Otherwise incredibly frustrating to go through two players both with unpredictable stutter and skip problems on different disks.In addition, the screen controls are limited. If you are playing an older letterboxed dvd, it will only show it with blackbands all around resulting in a 5' picture. You can only stretch the picture, not magnify it to fill the 16x9 screen."
5,fun placemat and art mat,"bought this for my nephew (3 years old) after getting a similar one as a gift for my daughter (2 years old). It works well as a placemat at meal time, or you can flip it over for a white drawing area with washable markers. Ours has gotten alot of use and is still holding up great. I would recommend as a gift for 2 and up kids."
3,Tedious to watch outside of Fields sequence.,"This ""episodic"" movie is mostly a slow Melodrama with the only comedy coming from W.C. Fields' 10 minute sequence in the middle.An ailing Millionaire decides to give away some of his wealth to those less fortunate ( this later bacame a television show in the 1950's ). The affects on the recipient's lives is dramatized in this multi-story movie. The highlight is the comedy relief story of W.C. Fields mid-way through. Fields buys a new (for that time) car and encounters a road hog.The rest of the film is more interesting for the historic value of seeing Paramount's stars of that time.Of historic note: in the 1960's & 1970's Castle Films sold the 10 minute Fields segment for home use on 8mm & 16mm film. In 1979 MCA Home Video sold the entire movie on ""DiscoVision"" Video Laserdisc as one of their first home video releases. Since then there has been no official release of this title to the home market ( the source of this DVD release is uncertain )."
4,Cheap but thin,"This sleeve fits a Dell Vostro 1500 neither snuggly or loosely. The claim of waterproofness is silly, neoprene is waterproof, but the zipper is not. The padding is thin, and offers little shock protection. However, it protects against scratches, dust, and the price is low."
4,Amusing and Insightful About Mr. Bush (Before Being Pres.),"Here are some mostly top drawer essays about Pres. Bush, before his Presidency. So I'll just note a few items not noted much by others here. The first is his religious conversion at about age 40, and questioning whether Jews can get to heaven. When he asks his mother, Barbara, if this is possible, she suggests calling Billy Graham, who replies that Mr. Bush should not play God. Second is his remarkable method of getting rich , by parlaying $600,000 into $16 million, by forcing certain well off people to move, and passing (barely) a referendum to apply a sales tax to pay for the new stadium. In both cases, property rights and low taxes appear at odds with standard GOP thinking! With the new stadium, the investors net worth skyrocketed! If only we could all be so fortunate! His time as Texas governor seems average enough, and there are some accomplishments in education and other areas. So this seems a reasonable critique for all sides."
5,TEXAS-TWANGED MOLLY READS IT BEST,"When it comes to political commentary nobody is quicker on the draw than syndicated columnist Molly Ivins. Now she focuses her Texas size wit on the most talked about politician in the Lone Star State - George W. Bush, whom she calls ""Shrub"" or simply ""Dubya.""She calls the man who is our President a man you would have to work at to dislike, while she traces his sometimes circuitous political career and astutely assesses his qualifications.No one is better suited to read ""Shrub"" than the sometimes gravely voiced Texas-twanged Molly."
2,Good Grief,"Molly must have a personal grudge with President Bush since all she seems to be able to do is find ways to bash him. Even the complements in the book are backhanded and it feels like the tone is anti-Bush.Molly has a way of telling a story to make it seem one sided, the book isn't totally unreadable but if you understand the Ivans/Bush relationship you need to read it with a grain of salt.This book would be better if you had a non-biased person writing it"
2,The Road Not Taken...,"Ivins has wasted her talent on this rather brief re-hash of the public record. Obviously meant to capitalize on current events, it would surely have been much more interesting if she had focused her ""Texas-sized smarts"" on answering the puzzle that so bedeviled her and her co-author: ""The puzzle of Bush is why someone with so little interest in or attention for policy, for making government work, would want the job of president, or even governor."" That would have been a worthwhile effort. It's not too late, Molly!"
5,Shearing the Family Bush,"When I picked up Molly Ivin's book ""Shrub"" I expected to read a fairly short, biting, and amusing commentary on a politician prone to malapropisms and frat-boy behavior. Instead I found myself crying. Crying because of the injustice that is occuring in Texas at this very moment, injustice cemented and continued by Bush's reign as governor. My strong reaction was due largely to the skill of Molly Ivin; although she is most assuredly not a member of the religious right, (she frequently pokes fun at them) the facts are presented in such a clear manner that they more than speak for themselves. Anyone expecting a 'tour de force' will be disappointed. This book is not ""Les Miserables"". However, if you're willing to be challenged, angered, and amused...you may find Ivin's book worthwhile reading."
4,Verified what I already knew...,"While Bush was campaigning it was clear to see he wasn't wrapped too tight and Ivin's book just verifies that over and over again. What is amazing to me is how he has fooled the American public. However, I believe that into his second year as ""that guy occupying the White House"" the public is beginning to understand the big mistake they have made. All they have to do is to look at their bank accounts and stock portfolios. It's that old line...""It's the economy, stupid!"" But Bushy boy is in great shape. This books tells all about how he sold stock in failing companies making millions before unsuspecting shareholders knew the truth. He bailed out & left them holding the bag. After reading this book the reader will be sick, disgusted and angry with George W."
5,You Gotta Love Buddy!!,"Wow!!! For just under eight bucks this CD is a steal! These are all tracks taken from his classic Chess Records period and they all smoke! When listening to a song like ""Leave My Girl Alone"" you can hear how he must have influenced the likes of Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin with the high notes he hits with such conviction and intensity. And that's talking vocals. Most people talk about his influence on the Guitar greats and that's all very true, but I'm sure he had an influence on singers too given what a great singer he was/is. What a performer! ""My Time After Awhile"" is another highlight with more strong vocals and smooth guitar work. ""Worried Mind"" was a surprise because I hadn't heard it before. Great song with Buddy's usual great guitar playing. At this point in time I'd have to say he's not only one of my all time favorite Blues guys but one of my all time favorite performers period. You gotta love Buddy!!!"
1,"Great Cast, horrible movie!",Nearly two hours of my life I will never get back. This movie was so painfully stupid and boring. I can't believe I didn't just turn it off! Don't waste your time!
4,FABULOUS shade of red!!!,"Good fit but, beware: runs small! Truly a corsette-type fit without the holding power. All up though, this is the most gorgeous shade of red!!! Love it!!!"
4,Does everything it's supposed to do,I gave it four stars instead of five because of something that was really my own fault - I underestimated the length I needed. A 50 foot hose just doesn't stretch as far as you think it will.
1,Digital Rip Off,I bought a trampoline for my grandchildren and wanted to send them some safety instructions. For 5 bucks you can learn that children should not jump unsupervised and that they should not do fancy manouvers. Also there is a medical summary of the most common injuries. Do not waste your money.
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this book over the weekend. The first thought was that it was actually a coloring book. Each page has very limited information about the subject and then a little activity on the back of each page. I wouldn't buy this book again..I really didn't see how a child could really learn anything about any of the subjects on the front of book. Every page just has little blurps of info not anything indepth. I would recommend the ""take along guides"" by by Diane Burns.Please don't waste your time or money on this book (unless it's on sale for .99)"
5,Most Truthful Book,"Just finished about the warmest, most truthful book I've ever read. God works miracles and Floriana's life is a testimony to His all-embracing love and faithfulness. I believe her father truly repented and is now in heaven with her truly saintly mother."
1,"Sorry, no good","Sorry, thought this was rubbish. Characters are thin, the plot thinner, and the 'masterful conclusion' that the jacket blurb promised, the only reason I read this terrible book to the end, just wasn't there at all.I know Campbell is supposed to be a legend, but on the evidence of this, I can't see why. I've read one other of his books, The Claw, which thankfully was far better, and I only hope his others are also better. This is his debut, apparently, so I'll let him off.But come on - and sorry, this really gets me - we're faced with a good guy called Chris, and a bad guy called Christopher, and we're not expected to realise it might turn out to be the same person? Give the reader some credit, please.The only good thing about this book is that it's short. Don't bother, you'll be wasting your time. I've read a lot of books, and very rarely do I think this little of them.Terrible."
3,"Not bad, not great","Though this book is one of, if not the first novels by Campbell, it is a little weak. Sure you see signs of his great skills of tension and story telling, but I suppose that I expected a bit more from a horror genius such as he.This is a decent read, and the ending is a bit strange. Perhaps strange enough to make the novel worth-while."
5,This is TOO Funny!,"This book is hilarious. It's a scream! The old nonsensical nursery rhyme is freshened up, dusted off and given a satirical slant. The parts with the horse are very funny. The humor runs rampant throughout this work and will leave readers of all ages, young children and adults alike laughing uproariously.For Beatle fans, the ""horse"" brings to mind ""Dark Horse,"" the one who pulls ahead, a description George Harrison often applied to himself. The short of it is, this book will delight all.Choldenko is a gifted author and is one to keep a watch for!"
3,Adorable but not soft,"This item is super cute and is true to the photo, however, it is by far not a soft item. The fabric is fairly rough, even after washing in Dreft several times. For that reason we haven't used it much. I would recommend purchasing a different, softer item."
4,Good swaddle blanket and cute print :),The swaddle blanket served it's purpose in snuggling our 5 month old daughter as she sleeps. The print is very cute as well.
2,Worst book I've read in a while,"I've read quite a few of Koontz's books, and this was garbage. How this became a bestseller I'll never know. I thought it was way too long, too stretched out. The strange happenings the (many, many) characters experience take up most of the book. I just got sick of it after about 400 pages. This is the first book I've had to stop reading and not finish it!"
2,not too bad,"for once i am not nauseated by koontz characters. don't really know why. perhaps because the events were more important than usually or perhaps because the plot doesn't focus on one person. the personality changes and events the characters go through are actually an ok read, but too much when all put together. well, at least it is somewhat relevant, which is not always the case with this author. the ending is disappointing. seems like koontz just gave up giving us a climax. a detail surronding the ending actually disgusted me philosophically, logically, almost religiously. i'll just say: godlike healing. either you understand, or you don't."
3,Bring on the black helicopters,"I would have preferred giving it 2.5 stars. Once again Koontz pulled me into the story and then went no where. I think a number of other reviewers have pointed out his inability to decide if it was God or alien or an alien God. I also think it is a shame he gave the characters all these great powers and then failed to make them greatly useful. BTW it was the longest 2 - 3 minutes known to mankind. I also was disappointed with page after page of repetition to then wrap up the end of the story - Boom, it's over. What a let down.I really liked some parts of the story, but once again he went too far with the powers of one individual in the big bad machine of government. If he could just let that go and get on with his writing we would all be much happier readers.The concept is fascinating and I would love to discuss this one in a book club type setting just to review the questionable points, plot holes, and other parts of the book.One more thing -Where was the dog?"
3,Predictable and overlong,"This one was a disappointment. It was obvious early on what these people all had in common. And while I liked some of the characters, others I didn't, so I was sometimes annoyed to have to leave one character to flit across the country to another one. Oh well. Read Midnight instead."
5,Koontz at his absolute best,"If you only read 1 D. Koontz, make this the one. I have read over 25 of his books (dissappointed in some and loved many others), and must admit this is him at his best (except for Watchers - a tough choice!). It's easy to rip a new one on Dean - I wish he did not feel compelled to put something out every year - why not be like Pink Floyd and do what ya want! So what if you have to wait 3 years - if it is a great book like this one, the wait be worth it. Bottom line - this book is just the best of this genre of writing, and the 700+ pages initially put me off, but I could have gone for more! Hope that DK puts out something of this caliber soon!"
1,Disappointed,"This book is very slow at the beginning. The only good part is the middle when they mystery reaches its climax. Unfortunately, the ending didn't live up to the strong element of suspense. The ending was hokie, cliched, and predictable."
5,Enough said!,"The only thing wrong with this book is that it ended!!! One of Koontz's best, I've reread it several times over the years and loved it every time. I'd STILL like the story to keep on going!"
2,Koontz can do better,"I didn't think I was ever going to finish this tedious read by Koontz. What was wrong with it: It was about 150 pages longer than it should have been; there were too many characters and not enough character development;and as the plot unraveled I realized how shallow, silly, and unoriginal it was; I mean, all these elaborate government conspiracy tales from Koontz are becoming really old. It's overkill. I've read most of Koontz's books and this is one of his worst."
4,Slow starter,I read a lot of Koontz novels. Most are great as is -- but a few have left me out in the cold. I was afraid this was one of the later type. At least for me it started off a bit disjointed and slow. I wasn't seeing any real connections or thread. But as I got further into the story it became very gripping and suspenseful Readers will enjoy this one!
5,Koontz Best Work...,"This book is truly amazing. It keeps you thrilled to the very end. The plot is good, the chaerctors are great, and the book is written masterfully. It is also makes an important comment about Aliens and about who should deal with them: Should the army make the Alien research as a part of creating a strategy in case that they are hostile, or should it be the science, that as a representer of the human curiosity, would ask questions first, and shoot, if needed, later?It is a cool and interesting book wither you are interested in Aliens or not. It gives a surprising answer to the ancient question ""Are we Alone?:..."
2,Not the greatest,"I am a HUGE Dean Koontz fan, but this one kind of let me down. It was all great and exciting until the end when the pieces started coming together... I won't give away the ending, but man, is it disappointing... The only thought that came to mind when the explanation of why they were all missing their memories was ""REALLY?!!!... give me a break."""
2,strangers,"I enjoyed the story ""strangers"" by Dean Koontz very much. The reason for only two stars is because of the way it was formated. A novel of this length is usually recorded on thirteen to fifteen cd's or tapes. this novel was on two cd's. This makes each chapter or section very long. If you want to change from a portable cd player to your car cd player, you may have to relisten to an hour or more. The story I would give 4 or 5 stars."
4,Slow start but nice finish,It was a little bit of a struggle the first 200 pages as it just seemed to go on and on about the same thing...but if you kept with it that long you would be rewarded with a solid finish. It was pretty fun trying to figure out exactly what happened to all these people with similar dreams and trying to figure out how this book was going to proceed. It turned out better than I thought and had some nice surprises a long the way. I'd probably say 3 and a half stars is probably more realistic but I'll go ahead and round up since the second half finished so well. Solid read.
5,Good Stuff!,I have been buying the 20 pack since my daughter gave me this stuff as a gift a few years ago. It's as close to old time movie popcorn I've ever had.
4,VERY WELL MADE,It was everything I remembered as a young lady and the product was of the greatest quailty.I am a very happy person.
5,Wow! Scary - but in a good way.,"We loved this movie! The footage is so captivating it totally sucks you in (pun intended). It's both scary and amazing to see how close the storm chasers get to tornadoes, and to see what people in tornado-prone areas of the country have to face each year. The storm chasers that are featured are fun, likeable, and of course, slightly nuts for doing what they do. We'll be watching this documentary again - probably every storm season!"
3,Gift,This is a Birthday gift for my grandson and his birthday is later this month and the DVD hasn't been viewed yet.
5,*****,Great price and quality. It took awhile to get it but it was definitely worth the wait. We couldn't even find 100 PSI in the hardware stores.
5,My first taste of rock,"I first heard this album when i was a kid and my dad would rock out to this tape while we were driving around. Besides the obvioius genius and God-given talent that these men have always brought to the table this cd has sentimentally always been my favorite. It is the best Petra album written to date. I have always had a respect for Bob hartmans ability in the guitar department and it seemed to me that after this cd they started to lean more towards the synthesizer than i would like. I did enjoy the later albums but this one and to a lesser extent ""On fire!"" are the Air guitar petra albums. Buy it."
1,Lots of problems - It's a dud,I used to like the CS 300 as a general HRM. There are several problems with this unit tat you don't find for a while.- No option for stem mount. Strap mount is hard to use if you need to take unit off the bike for other uses.- Forget about the connecting this unit to the Internet software. It uses an internal modem that you are supposed to place you computer mic next to the cs300 and it communicates with the Polar site. Good luck. This feature is worthless as it just plain does not work. Tried 3 different computers and 4 mics. Support was useless.- Stops receiving HR for no apparent reason then starts up again. It can take up to a full hour of riding before I get an accurate heart rate reading. I tried using the special electrode contact gel but still no good.- Sensor and strap roll over while swimming.I have purchased cycling computers for much less and they outperform thin piece of JUNK.
4,"GOOD PRODUCT, RECOMMENDED","I read all reviews here, and I was very worried about the quality of cs300, but I decided to buy it and I installed it in my bike and it works without problem, I recommended it, for amateur bikers. I play tennis too, and it is so useful for this or any other sport.He leído todas las críticas de aquí, y estaba muy preocupado por la calidad de la CS300, pero me decidí a comprarlo y lo instalé en mi bicicleta y funciona sin problema, lo recomiendo para los ciclistas aficionados. yo Juego tenis también, y es muy útil para este o cualquier otro deporte."
1,Polar,"This must be one of Polar's worst products. No way to delete files, one just has to wait for them to go away by themselves. The weblink sucks. If you're lucky you can get it to download data maybe one out of every ten times. Polar support non-existent."
5,There is a reason why every Howlin' Wolf song is a standard,"As much as I love Robert Johnson, he really isn't the king of blues. He's more second best. The true king is the one, the only Howlin' Wolf. You may as well burn all your Eric Clapton albums because this is the real deal. The pure sounds of the Delta are captured into every single Howlin' Wolf song. This is probably the best place to start with when it comes to the man and his music. It features all of his best and best-known blues tunes. There are few rock bands that didn't take a good deal of influence from the Wolf."
1,Never Again,"I was a huge fan full moon, but the latest installment to the puppet master franchise confirms (again)that there best days are behind them. I can't say how it ends I turned it off, it was that bad. I used to be religious about picking up all full moon movies as they became available. Now, I won't even rent one. Thanks for the memories."
3,Question - not review!,Before I order my mom's Christmas gift - Can any buyers tell me if Complete Commish has close captions or English subtitles for the hearing impaired? Despite many many requests Amazon persists in not including this information. Thanks all!
5,LOVE Dr Sinatra...,".. not only for this book... but for his knowledge on so many other topics. I first came across him in Suzanne Somers book ""Knockout"" and it sure sounded like he knew what he was talking about. The only thing I dislike about him.. is that if you write to him about something he has written.. he throws the same old story at you... they write, ""See your doctor"".. just what I was trying to avoid!!"
4,A good short with extremely valuable insight into film production,"I found this to be an entertaining short, great story and effects for an indie style studio.The in depth special features should be required viewing for anyone interested in film production."
3,beware of sizing!,"The muzzle itself is ok, but beware of sizing. The listing says that Size 4 is suitable for a Great Dane. NOT TRUE! This is way too small for a Great Dane...go to size 5XL. My Dane is not huge at 150 lbs, and the 5XL fit fine. Also be aware that some vendors for these muzzles ship them with no packaging whatsoever in a manila envelope, where others send them in proper store packaging. If you care about the packaging which has a lot of info on it, you might want to check first to be sure you are getting what you think you are."
2,falls flat,I live near Louisville...home of Churchill Downs. I started reading this just as Derby activities were getting in gear this year. Even with all the talk and interest in horse racing going on around me - I just couldn't get interested in this book. It is mostly plain old boring.The sections where P.G.'s stories are told are pretty good. You can get an idea of the kind of spitfire man he was. Other than that it is uninteresting.I gave up and asked my husband if he would like to read it. He tried too and wasn't able to wade through it either. It's not a long book..only 263 pages...small pages with big writing and big margins. Did I say boring ?
3,Cute but hurt feet,I loved these shoes in the store but they were out of my size so the girl had me try on the plain black leather pair and they fit perfectly. When I got these they felt really snug. I wanted them so badly I kept them but now can't even wear them. I ran into someone that commented on my shoes and how cute they were and she said she had a pair but they hurt her toes too. Maybe the fabric?
2,a flash of kitsch for vision-impaired,"Shiny flashy heavy metal band. Shiny flashy thick cheap-looking plastic body with huge letters/numbers on display. Childish colorful lettering surrounds the display. Watch that tells you it's there by weight. Watch that screams for attention, but has nothing to show when looked at. I prefer the content and logic of Casio digital displays, and will continue wearing their black model with rubber-band. I would pay $50 for Casio with thin light black-metal case and bracelet, half-size digits, and simple silver lettering."
3,Works good,Excellent watch for everyday use. This is the third one that I have had over 20 years and they really take a lot of abuse.
5,excellent watch for the money,"I bought this watch for its large clear digits, great for those of us who haven't 20 20 vision the band is too small for my large wrist so I put a large flexi band on it. it may not look as flash as others but it sure is practical"
3,Good but not a cool as the first,"The second and final film, this left a taste for more Cannonball Run in my brain. The DVD is excellent, except for a slight hum in the lower frequcncies. It is not constant, but is discernable."
3,Movie Nut,"I have always liked this movie, however, if it is on TV it is with a station that has commercials so I decided to buy it. Also, my ""significant other"" watches it every chance he gets with all the commercials. We both decided that Jackie Gleason makes the movie. It is corny but hilarious and all the players just seem to fit into their roles."
4,God Love the cannonball!!,"I thought the second was much funnier. I love all the actors and thought that the film was great. It shows a time when you could sit and watch a funny movie and not have to see alot of special effects. You don't need a big budget to make comedy. This is an innocent movie that was made to just have people laugh, thats all it does. I wish there were more."
3,Former Classmate,Only ordered this book to get copy of a poem?? mentioning our former classmates that didn't make it. Guess I am not into poetry of this style. Strange!
1,Ignorance and revisionism,"The author has given a reasonable and interesting history of warfare up until the 1600s. He does not understand the military and has ignored truth in defining and explaining their actions. He makes assumptions about current military thought based on ignorance. He has no knowledge of the current theories of war as presented by Boyd.He gives a typical liberal view of the military based on feelings from the 1960's. He ignores the actual facts of the behavior of American soldiers and assumes they rape, pillage and plunder as in the past. He describes the bombing of North Vietnam as carpet bombing by B-52s. He has no understanding of current air warfare. His description of using air power as a terror weapon reminds one of the older theories of Douhet and not those of Warden.The author needs to educate himself on current means of warfare."
3,The Father Of Rock N Roll,"AMAZON doesn't carry this title in stock so I had to get them to secure it for me from a third party seller. The first copy thay I received didn't work! They replaced it with one that did.ALL song tracks on this CD should have been presented in STEREO. I rated this as *** because the the program presentation. Had it been in STEREO, I would have rated it as *****.I don't know why CLASSIC songs like these are not digitaly remastered VIA COMPUTER to play in STEREO!If they re-released then in STEREO, most of the MONURAL copies would be replaced with STEREO discs!"
1,piece of junk,no good on xp and nivida there web site says there products may or may not work on xp stay away from ubisoft
1,Can't load it,I have a Pentium III 700 mhz and XP operating system with an ATI rage 3D card..I can't get this sim to run at all....CFS II and Strike Fighters run great on my computer. Microsoft makes the best flight sims.
2,don't believe the hype,"if you thought rowans battle of britain was a stinker wait till you play this one. it's a cross between janes and rowan, the worst of both. the only thing it has going for it is that it takes place on the eastern front.the multiplayer level is a joke, i was able to play only once due to my computer freezing up and trust me i'm running a great system. if you ask me microsoft cfs2 and cfs1 are still the best out there. but,overall it kept my interest for about a day.completly boring."
3,WELL....,I love flight simulation games and I love WWII flight games... Yet i am disapointed that this game does not meet the standards of a decent Flight simulator game... the graphics aren't that great and the enemy fighters are so easy to shoot down it takes the honor out of victory... However due to the lack of WWII simulation games I guess this will have to do~
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I agree with those who like the graphics of this game. I also like the idea of flying Soviet WWII aircraft. I looked forwarded receiving this game, boy was I disapointed with the way it ran. Very slow going from one menu to another. Freezing a lot of the time. I spent more time unfreezing, or trying to, than playing the game. I got tired of fighting it when it shut down for no reason. When it ran right, I did have fun with it. For the price it should run smoother. If this the best this company can do, I wouldn't buy stock in it."
4,great game,"This is a great game. It is inherrently more interesting than cfs2 in that you are not dealing with endless blue sky, blue water and identical atols. My only major caveat is that you have to fly all the way to the action. This cannot be excused on realism grounds as you have option of putting the plane on auto pilot and keying in accelerated flying speeds. Otherwise it is absolutely great--graphics,modeling,ground attack,scenery are all excellent. Picking out the enemy tanks from the friendy tanks in a interpenetrating front situation among village streets and small farms is a hard as it must have been in reality. Good game! Could be improved by including some of the best features from cfs1, cfs2 and Red Baron 3d. Seems to be inspired mainly by Janes World War 2 fighters---it definitely uses all the features that makes that game great!"
5,Wow best flight sim on the market at this time,"It will take alot to knock this flight sim off the top of the mountain. UBI stands for great flight simulation!!..Beats all other flight sims on the market. Best planes, weather and sound ive ever seen in a flight sim. Even comes with a mission builder. The possibilities are endless. Multiplayer is simply awesome! When flying in a thunderstorm lighting hits and the thunder pops scaring the hell out of you. Makes you feel like you there."
3,Good - but too short,"I bought this book for our upcoming trip to Cozumel. The book is good, the information is really good. The book is written in an easy to read and concise language. THe pictures are astonishing.My main reason for only giving it 3 stars is that it is not nearly comprehensive enough. I really need a much larger book about the different underwater life in Cozumel so I really know what I see when I get there.I would also love to see further information about favorite snorkel spots on the island. The additional info about the history of the island is nice info to have - but if I were to choose between that and more comprehensive underwater info I would go with the underwater info."
3,Odd,"A very odd book in my opinion; the order of the chapters makes it different from other books on the subject. For one, partial differentiation is treated before vectors, which is a significant deviation from most other advanced calculus texts out there. If you want to know the geometrical significance instead of analysis, buy another text this is after all a text on ADVANCED calculus. On the other hand, I don't know why the author calls it an advanced calculus text. Cross products and dot products are used instead of the inner product space; definitely not advanced. If you want a real advanced calculus text, buy ""Advanced calculus of several variables"" by C. H. Edwards. And Rojelio, learn some english. I had no idea what you were talking about."
2,Suicide: The Forever Decision.,"Even with its no-nonsense approach, to me the start of this book was rough as a self-help book aimed towards suicidal thinkers. If someone was in the state of mind to where they were very much depressed and suicidal, yet reaching out for help the words might bite back at them in a bad way.This might be a helpful book for those who are dealing with a suicidal person, but I wouldn't recommend a non-sympathetic toned book to be given to someone who is suicidal themselves. I would find a book with a warm, calm and relaxing tone to ease their brains into accepting the help they need.I suppose it would all depend on the person and how they handle criticism. I would imagine that most people in a suicidal state are fragile mentally and should have much more care and thought put into any words that reach them."
4,Practical Book,A book for engineers who haven't got time to study the lengthy derivation of mathematical equations. Ballpark figures and estimates are handy.
4,Traces the blues from the Delta to Chicago's South Side,"Traces blues from the delta into the heart of Chicago. In the process, moves from something close to Alan Lomax folk archive to proto-rock and roll. First Muddy Waters (1948) is just him with a acoustic guitar (!). Recognizable urban blues does not appear until 1952 (Eddie Boyd). Settings at the beginning are spare to empty. They fill out progressively, presumably as Chess gains production skills. Stand-out: tr 14: Howlin' Wolf (passionate abandon; full spectrum of color in his voice). Excellent recording detail on cuts. [46:57]"
2,lame collection,"Some interesting stuff, but this is simply a collection of emails and random thoughts, not worthy of being bound into a book in my honest opinion"
3,Easy to read overview of Canada's leaders,"Paints broad strokes to give a good overview of all of Canada's first 21 leaders. Interesting to see the ranking of each prime minister, bound to stir controversy. They do mention that the ranking of the more recent prime ministers are less static and can move up or down as their legacies are remembered or forgotten.A digestable section on each prime minister is displayed to capture the challenges and the corresponding successes and failures. This work is the result of querying Canadian panelists across the country for their opinions and the book is relatively balanced in its writing."
2,Life of Brian,"Funny in parts and pretty sad in other parts, just boring. I remember seeing it 30 years ago and thought it was funny, now not so much."
5,An all time favorite,"You must have an open mind to like this movie but if you do, its hilarious. Life of Brian is one of my all time favorite comedies."
4,Like the wit of Monty,"In their usual comical way of mocking different groups, organizations, etc, religion is no different. While some people may find the movie offensive it was funny and enjoyable."
4,Month Python's Life of Brian,"I saw this movie years ago at the theatre when it came out. It was oddball, off the wall and to me and my good friend who was also a fan of Monty Python, hilarious. I don't see it on tv much and it is nice to see the movie now and then. And it was a good price. If you like Monty Python, you'll enjoy this movie."
5,Monty Python at it's finest!,"Absolutly my most favorite of the Python films. A completely hysterical movie! One of the best parts is Eric Idle singing ""Always look on the bright side of life"" at the end."
5,Buy it or you'll regret it for the rest of your life,"I am a huge Python fan. (I mean, I like Monty Python a lot, not that I'm huge like the Stay Puffed Marshmellow man.) This is one of my favorites. If you don't buy this movie you'll regret it for the rest of your life and a penguin will possibly explode on your television."
4,Python at their Sacriligious Best!,"Jesus,watch out! Nothings sacred and that's what makes it so outragously funny."
5,Great movie with grat extras,"This movie has been around for a while and it is still hilarious. The extras included on the criterion dvd are well worth the higher cost. Perhaps the modern day Christian pharisees wrapped in their smug self righteousness will find this movie offensive or sacreligous, but do these Holy rollers watch movies anyway? If you haven't seen it, you should. This movie and ""The Holy Grail"" are two of the comedy classics of the late 20th century. Too bad they cut out the scenes with Otto. The only part I don't care for is the spaceship. The Pythons are all in top form in this movie, especially John Cleese. Enough said!"
3,That's funny?,"Sort of Saturday Night Live does Christ in a bad way... Although the acting is good and the comedy lines well done, it is so sad that they dishonorthe main part of what makes our civilization civil?That we believe legend as written or that there is humor in our lack of belief is probably what I dispute here:not that the comedy is well done or not.There is no way to tell after more than 2000 years where fact starts andmyth begins, but making fun of that ancient landmark life that transformed a barbarian Empire into something more is just pretty tasteless even if British upper class endorsed."
1,Dumb,Would not recommend bad comedy stupid storyline waste of money! Did not want to see nude man. If your a believer will piss you off!
5,Criterion Rocks,"I was very happy to learn my machine was region free and so could enjoy this masterpiece of comedy with precious deleted scenes and many other extras, including a wonderful array of commentaries and a behind the scenes documentary that are inexplicably missing from the Life of Brian DVDs available elsewhere in the world. Blessed are Criterion for weleasing the deleted scenes for posterity that were rescued from the private 1-inch reels in Terry Gilliam's house. Blessed are the film-makers for this gem that never grows old. If you love Life of Brian, get this DVD. (...)"
5,Laugh Of Brian,"British humor is not something just anybody enjoys...but among the best stuff to savor or get started with is anything even vaguely Monty Python. I loved Brian because it's delightfully absurd, slightly offensive, and just plain wicked (in the British slang sense). All Monty Python films must be viewed ad nauseum to fully appreciate every little nuance, every subtle move, every damn line until it's fully etched into your weary little brain and can be recited at a moment's notice in the presence of those people you've probably seen before chattering on about Big Noses and such without realising they were communicating via their nerdy little Python fantasies...but I digress. You can't watch this once. It isn't possible. You shan't appreciate it until it's in your blood. Not for overly religious types or the feint of Faith. Good, bloody fun. Thou shalt purchase Life Of Brian and so mote it be!"
4,"A great movie, not an immaculate edition","I'll assume everyone can find a review of the movie itself, and skip straight to this edition's features.The special features were fun and entertaining, but having been spoiled by Python's special edition releases of their other films, this one comes up a little short. Though what's there (an hour featurette, the original read through of the script [with animations by Gilliam]commentary) is excellent, and the film transfer is good, it lacks all the fun bits found on the Holy Grail or the Meaning of Life special editions.However, its the only game in town, it's an excellent film, and a great disc."
5,Round it up to 5 Stars,"Monty Python humor is too uneven to rate five stars, but BRIAN is spectacularly funny in places, never boring nor boorish.Worth buying."
2,"Great movie, lousy sound","I love Life of Brian. It is one of the wittiest movies I know. But the sound quality on the DVD (the $9.99 version, not the Criterion version) is appalling. The disk doesn't offer subtitles so one misses half the dialogue, listening to the muffled, garbled sound track. I've never heard a worse DVD. Don't buy this version!"
1,Wrong product,Expecting a card reader that would read CF cards - this one doesn't - missed the fine print
2,Destroyed my SanDisk Ultra II memory card,"This card reader worked great for about year or so, then one day it corrupted all the files it transferred. Luckily, I was still able to transfer the pix directly from the memory card/camera to the computer. But THEN when I tried to use the card again, it would not work. So, it completely destroyed a SanDisk Ultra II 1GB memory card. Needless to say, I can't use this product any longer.Later, I found that it wasn't the card reader, but the Nikon D70s that was causing the corrupt files. I had to scrap the camera. I'm still using the Sandisk ImageMate, happily."
2,"I like Elemis, but....","100ml of Camelia Oil can be obtained for $8.45 from japan woodworker -- this is the exact same stuff. I don't have a problem with most of Elemis's unique products, but I don't see the point of paying $32+ extra for the same content.Camelia oil is also great for kitchen knives after sharpening, btw. I use it on plane blades. I guess I'll have to start using my extra bottle on myself."
3,Not sure yet......,"I've heard very good things about this product for helping with stretch marks during pregnancy. I won't really know how well it works until I've started to go back to my pre-pregnancy shape. It has a nice fragrance that doesn't stick with you for too long, and it isn't greasy after it's been on your skin for a while; so that's nice."
5,BEAUTEOUS!!!,"This was one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen, of an area which I had never ""visited"" before on film. It showed Iran in all its beauty, lovingly and emotionally.The young boy who plays the role of the blind child, Mohammed, was extraordinary. His scene near the pond with the blind carpenter was one of the best I have ever watched. The director also did some wonderful things with the boy's hands: when he read and ""wrote"" his Braile materials, when he learned about something by feeling it, when he searched for the tiny bird in the leaves.This movie showed the power of family love and the devastation when a child feels unloved. It also allowed the viewer to get a glimpse at the way of life in the countryside of Iran.I would highly recommend this touching film....you cannot help but be affected by it."
5,Touching & Powerful,"This is one of the best Iranian films ever made. The praise it has received on this page is well deserved and this is a ""must see"" for all who want to get a taste of Iranian filmaking."
2,Yawn,"This game is not as good as Rouge Spear Urban Ops. For starters you can't pick between a list of real guns, grenades are ackward, The whole multiplayer chat and interaction between games is basically nonexistant, and the crosshair is an enourmous yellow thing. This game is more like Half-Life or Quake."
3,Uhm Can I Say Lag In Single Player Mode?,"Yes very very laggy in single player mode for me. i have a 750mhz 48x cd-drive with a pentium 3 and i lag very badly. it is because I only have 64mb ram. So no matter how big your computer is it does not run good at all without ram. So with the requirments on the box,dont look at them they dont help u at all."
4,"So many maps, so little time","I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter because the price was right. But, I was happily surprised by how thorough and lovely the pictures are. The beginning of the book contains a comprehensive section on how to read maps, and explains how a map can represent different information (climate, politics, terrain). Each continent also had photographs of the people, and natural formations that are identified with it. That was nice!But, all cannot be perfect alas. Many of the maps span two pages, to make it larger I presume. However, and this is REALLY annoying, you cannot see what is in the crease between the two pages! The United States is missing parts of it, Africa is bisected at the Congo. I would rather Nat'l Geographic had made each map a fold-out. I guess there would have been a chance that it would eventually get ripped out, but at least you can see the whole area being shown."
3,Not up to expectations,"1. The book is bound in such a manner that the binding conceals map features in the binding making them difficult or impossible to see.2. The content of explanatory material is too general. It presents no challenge to further interest children at the high end (age 11-12)of the recommended age grouping.A book like this should present a challenge to motivated children.If used with an adult it would be fine for younger children, but wouldbore or frustrate an adult trying to motivate an older truly interested, highlymotivated youngster. A sad commentary on the inspiration for this agegroup. We are grandparents of 79 years, whose 4 children have broad anddeep interests that they have conveyed to their children."
4,The second of only two great albums,"Ansley Dunbar ""drummer extrodinaire"" hit the blues limelight in the UK with John Mayall's Bluesbreaker's album ""A Hard Road"" in the 60's. It was obvious that here was a man with such technical excellence and passion that the formation of The Retaliation was bound to grab the attention of the British blues fans, and he did big time. Shame that he only made 2 albums with his band. This is the second one and although diverse and compelling in it's lyrical and musical delivery, the first simply called ""The Ansley Dunbar Retaliation"" was a masterpiece and still shines in the cosmos of British blues. So where is it?Anyway back to this album. The slow sultry voice of Victor Brox matches even the greatest blues singers in tone and feeling. If you like ""White Boy"" and ""British Blues"" this one is for you. A must for any collection. Enjoy!"
3,Helps but it's a huge dose and a huge pill.,These vitamins do help when you are feeling ill but it requires a lot of pills throughout the day and the pills themselves are huge which makes taking so many kind of difficult.
5,Finally I was able to stave off a cold!!,"I get colds 2-3 times a year and they always turn into sinus infections where I need antibiotics. I take Flonase, which used to work great but now doesn't keep me from getting the cold initially, and I used to love Zyrtek's nasal swabs but those are now off the market. I always do saline nasal rinses when I feel a cold coming on, and that helps a lot but doesn't always keep me off the antibiotics either.I got a sore throat on Tuesday and since everyone I know has been sick over the last month, I knew my time was here. I took some probiotics and the ""intensive"" dose of System Well, three in the morning and three at night, every day, and now it's Sunday and I feel all better. I never got a full blown cold like I usually do, my throat just stayed mildly sore as I fought this off. No congestion, no stuffy nose, no coughing. Very pleased."
4,A pretty good game,"I got freedom wings after i saw it in the cover of nintendo power, and i had to do some searching to find it. I am glad I did! the story mode is excellent, and the graphics are great. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating, is because if you beat it, then you start from the beginning with all the planes and money and weapons you had when you beat the game. And the multiplayer stinks, but i still recommend it"
1,Bad Phone,"This unit is an absolute piece of crap. The audio quality of the phone is tinny, fades in and out, and it is almost impossible to have a conversation on it. The radio is also tinny. I've had better radio sound way back in the 1950's with a Japanese plastic transistor radio strapped to the visor of my Ford convertible. You can't really tune the radio to any degree of accuracy, as the tuning wheel is stiff and difficult to use. The light for the clock only comes on when a button is pushed, then immediately goes off again. You can't just roll over, open one eye and see what time it is. Very user unfriendly. After one week, I unplugged this unit and put it on a shelf in the garage. If I had the original box, I'd send it back to you."
4,Who needs a plot?,"I agree with C. O. DeReimer that the gardens are beautiful. While the Laura Thyme character has a certain charm, Kendall's Rosemary is a joy to watch. After ""nearly sixty years"" on stage and screen, I think her youthful vitality still shines brightly and makes the whole series worth watching.My wife and I have yet to figure out the plot on any of them. Sorting out relationships between characters is a full-time job. Heck, who needs to understand the episode? Relax and enjoy the beauty of the settings and the warmth of the leading ladies."
3,Very difficult and frustrating,"If you want to play this game, a recomend you that first, read all the Big Manual (that came with the game), and then try to play. It's a fun game, but you still in the same level by a lot of hours."
5,Easy Read for a boss that may be in a rut and need a pep talk.,As the owner of Integrity Management Solutions Group http://intmsg.com. I feel as if this is a easy read for someone who is in need of a pep talk. I would not consider this book a how to book as the title would lead you to believe; although it is a quick easy read. If you are looking for quick quotes and reminders this book is for you.
3,"Defintely not a ""how to""","How To Become A Great Boss is a book of rules and anecdotes. It's easy to read - in fact it only took me about 2 hours from cover to cover. All the rules mentioned by Jeffrey J. Fox are appropriate and if applied, would work well for all bosses. Now there's the rub - ""if applied"". There is no suggestion in How To Become A Great Boss as to how one might apply these rules, merely a description of the rule and an anecdote to illustrate.I liken How To Become A Great Boss to a New Year's resolution - fine, valid and admirable on the 1st of January, but forgotten by the 31st!If you are looking for a reminder of what makes a great boss, then this book may appeal. If you are looking to find out ""how to"" become a great boss, then this book falls short of the mark. There's a place for vicarious learning, but not in such an important topic as management.Bob Selden, author of What To Do When You Become The Boss: How new managers become successful managers"
5,Best Customer Support Anywhere,"I have had this printer for four or five years now with few problems. It makes glossy color prints and crisp written sheets. There are a loads of options, including a setting that uses no color toner for B&W...a; significant cost savings. The lcd technology is superior to laser.What really impresses me is the 24/7 customer support line. When something is not explained in the manual or I am just not getting it (there is an occasional error message which is not in the manual; I had trouble setting it up as a network printer; etc.), their technicians have patiently walked me through the process to completion. I had a Brother before...the first time a I called, their number, it was disconnected. HP had stopped supporting a 5 year old model I tried calling on.Supplies are a bargain on the internet. There must still be a lot of these older babies out there printing away."
4,Easy to operate,Easy to use even when you are illiterate in digital cameras. The battery had a much shorter life than I had expected but of course I haven't used a digital camera before so maybe that is normal. I like the zoom factors when I am wanting detailed pictures.
3,At Last must have been her last,"good song!Most of the songs are doo-wop 50s songs. Which are alright. But none have the soul and sound of ""At Last"" the only REALLY good song on the CD, in my opinion."
3,classic,Some of the best songs you will ever hear. etta james will be missed! at last... my love has come along...
2,Not as scary as you would think.,"This book was a nice collection of short stories, but not as scary as you would think it would be. The reviews make is seem hard to put down. But it wasn't hard at all. There were one or two stories that were creepy. But as a whole, I was dissapointed. I didn't like the way that the author presented the stories either. It was confusing. He didn't introduce the person he got the story from well. His comments on each story, written in italics, and with too many ellipsis marks were overdone...I don't need to have the author's voice try to scare me as I read. If it is a good story, it will do that naturally. I wouldn't label this book as a waste of money, because it goes on my shelf with the rest of my collection."
3,Just OK...,"After reading the reviews on this book I could not wait to have it and start reading it. Well, when I started reading it I found that to me it just didn't have the ""spell"" that it apparently had on other people... hence, I didn't get scared as I thought I would be, not even close. Although, don't get me wrong, it's an OK book, at least an entertaining reading... but that's all, nothing Earth shattering if you ask me..."
1,Is this the same author?,"Judging by the reviews, this is a book that readers either really like or really don't like. Count me in into the latter group. I have been a Hamilton fan since ""Map of the World,"" but I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were not realistic, despite an intriguing and viable premise. In my opinion, the adolescent son's voice was stilted and the parents were both too weak to inspire the readers' empathy or interest. I didn't like any of the characters and forced myself to finish the book, hoping for a meaningful resolution, which didn't come. I hope Jane Hamilton will get back on track with her next book."
3,Disobedience,"The title says it all. Each member of the family disobeyed and broke trust with the other family members. I finished the book because it was the selection for that month for my book group. But it's not among my favorites. It's not a ""must read."""
2,disobedience=disapointment,"This is the first time that I have read anything by Hamilton. Maybe it just takes some getting used to, but there seemed to be pages of rambling that had nothing to do with the core of the tale. I found myself continuing to read the novel soley to finish it, not because I was consumed by the story line. While the book was readable, it was a struggle to finish the 176 pages that seemed to lead nowhere."
2,A Disappointment,"I have read all of Hamilton's other books and loved them, so I was disappointed when I had to force myself to get through this laborious book. None of the characters were likable, nor was the story line exciting enough to keep my interest sustained. The story had potential had the relationships between mother and son, mother and lover, and mother and father been more developed, but I was left wanting more dialogue, more confrontation, instead of listening to the son prattle on and on about his adolescent angst. If you're a Hamilton fan, wait for the paperback version or get it from your library - save your money."
3,A stray from Jane Hamilton's usual,"I loved The Book of Ruth and Map of the World...I love Jane Hamilton's writing style, thoughtfulness and throughness. Disobedience was nothing like her past novels. I had a hard time getting through it. I found the civil war reinactment very odd....actually the whole book was odd. It ends with somnewhat of a meaning. I didn't finish it unsatisfied, just mystified as to how Jane Hamilton came up with such an odd plot. It didn't reach me as her other novels have. (I have not read Short History of a Prince...though at this point I think I am afraid to). Good luck to those who try and get through this novel..."
3,"Unique source, lacks content","I had high expectations for this disk. As a student of intelligence (national security), I do a lot of reading on the subject. I purchased this disk as a portable ready reference.Many of the papers here are very good, but didn't cover the depth or scope of the topic.The graphics leave a lot to be desired. If the price were less ... I would recommend this product. The copying job looked like poor .pdf files... like a home job. Very poor quality.The content is there, but everything else is lacking."
1,Oh dear Lord...,"Yes, I bought this book once upon a time. Even back then when I bought it I thought it was full of nonsense. Now, several years later and after having discovered old system magic, well I have to say that my first impression of it was absolutely correct..."
1,please stay away from this book!,"I have looked through this book and as a Witch, I was very VERY insulted by what I saw. This book brings disgrace to Witchcraft. Witchcraft has one main rule ""harm none and do what ye will."" This book encourages people to cast spells on other people, which is very wrong. Real Witches believe that whatever you send out comes back three fold...we do NOT send out that sort of negative energy!If you are ne to the Craft, I could make some great suggestions for books to read about what Witchcraft is really all about. e-mail me at: yesterdaysnews63@aol.com"
1,It is no doubt a shame,It is a shame.. I would take several hundred thousands.. those who are in grave as witnesses against SS division called Galicia. An attempt to rewrite the history. Please bring this as an evidence. Please see those faces when you talking about SS DIVISION innocence.It is known that Ukrainians were one of cruel murders and that's what should say the cover of this book. Nothing else. Those are heroes for some on Ukrainian west.It looks like someone does believe that killing women and kids is for good.. What a shame.
1,Nazi apologist also,"Hey, Devil's advocate. I think you can see that Mr Marsh doesn't actually state that the Riga murders were made by the Galician Division and that you are the fool for thinking this. The Galician division was a bunch of murderous butchers like the rest of the SS. This book tries to make a positive case for them and it is unsurprising as it was written by the son of one of their members. Members of the Galician Division were not charged with any war crimes after the war and many of them settled in the United Kingdom, as did Michael Melnyk's father, but this does not mean that they didn't commit any atrocities. At the end of the Second World War many people escaped prosecution in an attempt to merely move onwards much like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa after the fall of apartheid. No-one would would assume that certain white South African police officers were not responsible for brutal crimes merely because they weren't charged."
5,Best devotional I have ever read!,"I purchased this devotional book shortly after it was first published in the 1970s. It is the best I have ever read or owned. Every single page is powerful!! Richard, now deceased, was once the chaplain of the senate."
2,Where the Evil Began,"If you're into anime you have most certainly heard of Ranma 1/2 and when you look at the sites dedicated to the series you begin to notice some odd ones: Shrines devoted to couples that don't exist in the original. Well, folks this is where it all started. If you're looking to put the blame for all of the shrines devoted to Ryouga and Ukyo or Mousse and Shampoo this is the place to look. It's all this things fault. While cliched and silly this is still a lot better animated than the original television show and is still entertaining if predictable fare."
2,The buckle/strap construction is total crap,"The shoes themselves are fine, and they look good. HOWEVER, the first time I tried to wear the shoe, the little metal ""eye"" that goes into the ankle strap hole fell off completely. In my attempt to fix it (with a knife, really poor choice on my part) I ended up stabbing myself in the hand 7 days before my pole competition. So. Not. Awesome. But I did end up fixing the shoe. Or so I thought. the night of my competition, the exact same thing happened, to BOTH shoes. Thank the sweet Lord someone happened to have a pair of pliers, so I could fix the shoes. It was an easy fix, but it's also an easy thing to do correctly when the shoe is made in the first place. This speaks to a lack of quality control during construction, so be aware!"
2,What where they thinking?,"So while watching this movie there were a lot of frustrating, boring, corny scenes. This is by far the most wimpy Hit man Movie I know. She is always crying and messing up so it was very annoying and boring. What a blah! I felt like giving the movie away because is an insult to my collection."
3,Great for any Canibus fan,"to me canibus sounds best over harder beats, this cd doesnt seem to skimp out on them, maybe a few times, but over all the beats match the rhymes very well. i got into most of the tracks on here, still got to listen to it more in depth. canibus sounds the same on almost any track, so the standouts are where he can remove himself a bit from battle rap and into story mode or the like."
2,Lost Princess Found,"Pretty bad movie.The acting and dances are very good, but the complicated plot of a child princess lost and later found as a street dancer has many holes. Similar story lines are handled much better in other films, especially some European classics.The stunt scenes are lengthened unnecessarily and the movie is too long because of that. Still there is an entertainment value for an audience that likes folk dances."
3,Blade review,I chose blade out of curiosity but I recommend it to those of you who like the blade story line.
2,Cheap foreign made,"I expected a little better quality, but this was another cheaply made China import. While the blade is servicable, it isn't the strongest. And speaking of not being the strongest, the handle (advertised as being ash) isn't anywhere close to being ash and isn't what I would consider a long handle regardless of the acronym used - LHRP."
4,Not EXACTLY like theater popping oil,"Pretty good stuff, but I'm finding it hard to emulate that flavor I get in the theater. Instructions with a table showing the proper ratios for popcorn, popping oil and seasoning would have been helpful!! It is far better than Orville's ""butter popping oil"". The shipping cost was about half the cost of the oil so it would have also been nice to have this as a ""free shipping item"" even if it would have to be combined with other items."
4,Artery-Hardening Goodness,"This stuff tastes good and gives that nostalgic movie popcorn smell. It doesn't exactly give that nostalgic movie popcorn flavor though. Still, it is pretty good. Best of all, it is loaded up with that good old artery-clogging coconut oil, so you know itis long opn that old essential yom factor."
4,Fab product,"If you want movie theater popcorn that YOU pop using real popcorn, this is the product for you"
4,Great for theater taste,Used this with Flavocol seasoning for that taste that I was looking for. I can now have that theater taste that I was looking for!
3,"Good idea, poor fit ..","Got this for my Tippmann A5 and it does what it is supposed to , moving your hopper out to the side to clear your view ( and gives you some room for more balls )but it was not sized correctly , it was to tight at the top where it meets the hopper and too loose at the base where it connects to the feeder , you could force it into the hopper and add some tape to secure it to the gun , my friend did just that and it works on his gun , an X7 , I decided to get a high capacity hopper instead , for the price it was not worth to return it ."
3,A real enigma.........,"Quality ( clear illustrations & print, very nicely bound)=10Scope of content=3 Nice, but not a whole lot there. A fullversion of this quality would be worth 2 to 3X the price ofthis 16 page version."
5,Blessings from the past,"A wonderfully clear presentation of the methods of Sicilian cooking through presentation of many important recipes. The author's recollections of his grandfather who taught him to cook shows the warmth, humor and culture of the Sicilians. Many of the recipes familiar in my childhood are found in this book. Now my daughter is learning one important aspect her great grandmother's culture.I look forward to the revised edition and plan to buy several copies for friends and family."
4,also on DVD!,This movie is now available on a Canadian DVD release at www.sullivanboutique.com and the DVD includes an insightful short behind the scenes film featuring Colleen Dewhurst and Sam Waterston -- a real treat.Hopefully the DVD will be made available through amazon.com soon so more people will know about it.
1,They should be called Slutz instead Bratz,"I hate these Bratz dolls. I know I will never buy any of Bratz dolls for my child. I think it's a shame that these Bratz twins dressed like sluts.Parents out there, please don't buy these dolls for your child because they may teach your child to dress like a slut. Buy other dolls for your child's sake."
5,gorgeous,I love these dolls s they are gorgeous especially phoebe the angel she looks much prettier than roxxi but any waythey are great dolls and I recommend them to everyone.
4,"Strong beat, varied orchestrations, vocals on every track","MERENGUE - Best of ballroomThis CD has 18 tracks averaging about two minutes, 15 seconds (1:46 to 2:45). There are varied orchestrations on each track featuring trumpets, keyboard and drums, with an occasional piccolo or trombone solo. Every selection features male vocals: solo, duet or ensemble, singing Spanish lyrics (although track # 18 appears to have some French lyrics). The rhythms are samba/merengue with a strong beat. Exceptions to this are track # 8, a slow male duet, and track # 10 an understated ""La Bamba."" Tracks # 11 to 16 each have the word ""Conga"" in their title. Only tracks # 11 and #16 have the expected conga- rhythm. As a dancer, I can recommend this CD--although I know many dancers are turned off by the vocals."
5,Excellent addition to the Witch World series,"I've loved Andre Norton's premise of finding a new life in another world via a gate ever since I read Witch World, the first and one of my favorite Witch World books. Eleeri is a great heroine; and her escape from a misguided social worker begins a great adventure, even as it recalls the time when helpless children were removed from their homes to be educated... And because she doesn't know how dangerous Keplians are, she rescues a mare and her foal, and then..."
4,aaahhhhhh!,"Well...... once again as many others i was forced to read this much to my ismay. and i still to this day (well..... 4 days after reading it). Don't have a clue what wen't on a why it is such a ""excellent"" book. My trouble was probably the fact it was in spanish and i as many of the younger generation had seen teh film before. and as any one knows some takes the pleasure away when reading it.!"
1,Highly overrated,"In my view, this is an overrated work. Words put together on paper do not necessarily make literature. Marquez is good in describing situations, he paints with words. But whoever thinks that literature should contain messages between lines, does not have to bother to buy this book."
3,A Spanish cultural window,"Cold blooded murder as Spanish honor... by twins with butcher knives.A transplanted Arab who took a maiden's virtue, so that her husband took her back to her mother's house on their wedding night.This novel is very well written so that you feel like you have been transported to a past time.The Spanish male has two sets of morals: one for the public imageand the other for private life.In a way the young Arab man met an end of his own making?Death sentence for consenting sex is just not a very modern American attitude."
2,Uhh.. Kind of bad...,"I bought this book for a present, but i had to keep it for myself. The quality of the paper is really bad and the pages have diferent sizes giving it a really bad look. If u r buyng it to read by urself, go ahead, it is complete."
3,not as good as original,"I bought this for my kids ages 3, 6 and 8. They are all big fans of Peter Pan. None of them cared for this movie-I was surprised. I have no complaints on the quality of the movie."
3,a short review.,"First, this movie is overrated and doesn't come close to the Disney original. Disney once stood for quality and entertainment. Now they will exploit any of their classics with a plethora of bad sequels.I'm not just a hater of new Disney, I own and have seen this movie. Some of it is actually not too bad. Captain hook is funny and the animation is top notch. However, Peter Pan doesn't seem like the same Peter. He seems more immature and annoying. Also, why did they need to have the same dog and call it Nanna 2? This just goes to show how little thought was put into the movie. Out of all the names for the dog, they choose Nana 2.... my god!"
2,terrible sequal,"This movie was a poor excuse for a sequal. It sounds like they did not even try to find voices that sounded at least a little like the original characters voices. Hook was just about the only one who sounded close! Also, Disney could have kept the music like in the first one instead of using the upbeat stuff that did not fit in. Neverland looked completely different, and they didn't even show the Indians. They used too much computer animation. It is not even worth renting. I would save my money for something else if I were you."
2,Antequated,"The book is copywrited in 1987. It tells you how to set up your paper on a typewriter. There is one section that is relevant to today, but other than that, it is too outdated to be of any help."
4,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,"After you read a book as well written as this one, it ruins you for others a long time to come. Suzanne Brockmann has several interesting characters in this modern day novel, each very differant from the other. I've not been a fan of contemporary novels in the past, but after reading-- The Defiant Hero, I'm hooked. It's got action, romance galore, and some of the most endearing characters. Enjoy!"
2,campbell is of course awesome but the compilation here is not so great,"As a huge Campbell fan, I found the visuals of things like waterfalls and constant new age music very distracting and unnecessary. The fluidity of Campbell's thoughts loose context and poignancy when dissected and dispersed between rather cheesy ""New Age"" sounds and visuals."
1,CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE!!!,"I don't think artists should use marginalized and discriminated against cultures this way. My understanding is that indigenous Peruvian people suffer pretty bad from discrimination within their country, and here's a little movie that invents a backwards tradition and portrays an indigenous community's fictional wife swapping and a father/town mayor that can't wait to have sex with his pretty young daughter. Imagine an American movie that portrayed Latino, African American, or Native American cultures that way! With no basis in fact it would never fly. The interesting aspect of the movie is that it makes you think about how such a tradition would cause nothing but suffering for all involved, and if it were, for example, an American movie about white country folk it might be like a Children of the Corn/ Twighlight Zone kind of creepy concept, but in this context the racial implications are impossible to ignore (or forgive)."
3,Artistic Intentions Not Fully Realized,"Salvador, a metizo from Lima, ends up getting stranded in the remote indigenous village of Manayaycuna. Don Cayo, the town's mayor, locks him away so he won't interfere with the upcoming Holy Time. Holy Time occurs between Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The people of Manayaycuna believe that on these days God is dead and all sins are permitted. Salvador escapes from his locked pen and befriends Cayo's daughter Madeinusa. Salvador and Madeinusa plot to leave together for Lima. But, in the end, a disturbing twist changes the plan.Thi is a highly symbolic film aiming to be ""high art"". But I personally was left confused and unsatisfied. I believe that movies, and other creative forms, that are so vague in meaning as to become indecipherable are neither artistically successful nor pleasurable to watch. Some may like this film for it's lofty intentions. But I found it to be overly pretentious and boring."
5,Transformational,"The first time I read this, which was years ago, I found it transforming. Just now, at another moment in my history, I feel encouraged and inspired."
4,A GREAT BOOK. AND THAT'S OUR FINAL ANSWER!,"We haven't had this much fun since we last played with our Ouija board! And finding answers to those questions plaguing you -- queries about live, love and liberty -- has never been easier: Simply touch your fingertips to the ""Magical Message Indicator"" in the center of the fold-out game board and ask your question. Quicker than you can say ""tarot"", a slight tingling sensation will pull the indicator around the board to rest on one or more of the illustrated symbols ... then look up the meaning of the symbols in the accompanying book. All we ask is that you never ask -- not even once -- ""Is that your final answer?"""
2,"""Tall poppy, tall poppy, tall poppy""","This book is dated, superficial, and at 70 pages of fairly large type, barely a book at all. I most enjoyed counting the number of times the authors wrote ""tall poppy syndrome."""
5,Very Nice!,"My Son liked it very much, nice and sturdy, a great set! they dont break the first time you use it."
2,Cutesy Turned Heretical,"If you think of ""Stolen Summer"" as a mockery of Catholicism, then I guess this movie deserves five stars. The religiosity and works based thinking of Catholicism is amusingly portrayed. This movie supports the recent findings of the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life. Catholics scored low on their knowledge of the Bible, their knowledge of other religions, and their knowledge of their own religion.""Stolen Summer"" ends with the heretical notion that it doesn't matter whose name you call on as long as that person represents good. It would be a cute movie if salvation wasn't a critical issue."
4,vegetarian the best-ever recipe collection,"like new, the condition of this book makes me glad that I purchased it used.It is great condition and NO marks. and the recipes are GREAT"
1,Never received book,"I unfortunately never received this item in the mail, so I do not know how it is. Amazon refunded my money though, which was great customer service-Thank you!"
5,A Re-Issue of the 1974 Version,"This must be a re-issue of the same book that Koontz published in 1974, in which he lays down exactly the way you write a best seller. I only have a copy of that book in Xerox. Anyway, he tells the most important secrets here. If you're ready to understand what he's talking about, you can use this to base a novel-writing career. No exaggeration. Fantastic book. Changed my life."
4,Was discontinued by The Learning Company,"Ultimate Family Tree is a great genealogy program which lets you do almost everything you could think of, even write reports in languages other than English. To me, this is THE genealogy program... While, for example, Family Tree Maker is a good program, too, it lacks a lot of the data entering capabilities of the Ultimate Family Tree.However, I would like to point out to potential buyers that its manufacturer ""The Learning Company"" has recently discontinued this software. They've decided to only sell Family Tree Maker instead of offering both programs. So buyers should think very carefully if they want to buy arguably one of the best programs on the market knowing support will probably be very limited if not nonexistant in the future."
5,Great product,"I am very noise sensitive due to a neurological condition. Noise increases my condition so it is in my best interest to be able to quiet things down quickly. I use these when I grind coffee, use the blender, food processor, or if the TV is on. They are fantastic. I have had others. These are my favorite so far. I have 2 pair. One in my husbands shop, one in the house."
2,There are Better Ones to Buy,"In my opinion the Howard Leight R-03318 Leightning L3 Shooter's Premium Earmuff is way better quality than these muffs. The Howard Leight ones have padding on the head band and are much better to wear than this Peltor. Only leg up that these have over the Howard Leight is that they fold up and take up less space in my tactical bag. If I had to make this purchase over again, I would have bought the Howard Leight ones."
2,Very Fragile. Doesn't cut out noise,"I bought this item from Amazon.com. Item arrived in a well packaged box. I paid around $40 for this. The worst thing about this item was the shipping charges and custom duties (accounting for > $10). I use this item during household activities such as vaccuming and during work related air travel (on small jet stream air crafts).Pros:Comfortable on my ears.Soft materialCons:Doesn't seem to cut out noises effectivelyVery fragile - after 5 careful uses, it seems that the outer layer of the ear muff may break soon.Amazon.com is very bad at not shipping items in Canada!Costly shipping and Customs FeesSummary: I would not buy this item again and would not recommended. I would also not recommend buying from Amazon.com. This item is not available through Amazon.ca. Also sometimes Amazon.com has more accurate market value/price for items compare to Amazon.ca (just in case if you are in located in Canada)."
5,Right on target,"Tom White's ""The Believer's Guide to Spiritual Warfare"" is right on target. It covers many issues that are sometimes confusing to those who haven't read widely or been involved in spiritual warfare. It is biblically on target. You won't be disappointed."
3,not bad but could have been better,"I am from Bombay,India, & I had to check out this album by Majella because im a big Daniel O'Donnell fan, having most of his cds and concerts on dvd. Now coming back to Majella's album's its not bad but could have been better i felt she drags a bit when she sings also she should do less of covers and come up with something original, and i thought it would have been nice if there was atleast one duet with Mary Duff..not bad Majella"
5,Great collection of the authentic Mambo/Cha Cha Cha Sound!,"This collection certainly brings back memories of those great ballroom dances of years ago. Good sound, good music, good buy!"
1,I hate to be uncharitable,I got this game to try to get an old school Fallout 1&2 type experience.I could barely get this program to work. My machine is a pretty fast Windows 7 machine with a good graphics card. I think Windows 7 doesn't like it.I just can't recommend it.
2,Metal Heart,This game does not have good enough grapics for me. My computer is more up to date. I am wanting better but it would be alright for someone else.
3,shut up and drive snippets,"only bought it for shut up and drive, although i did then go and buy the millenium album by chely after hearing the snippets"
3,"Very good, yet somewhat annoying and can be expensive.","I like this program a lot, but if you buy it and want to have a large variety of cards to choose from, prepare to shell out more cash. The program comes with a very linited supply, but you can upgrade. I have purchased 3 additional sets, and still am not extremely happy with the selection I have (example -- I currently have only three cards for a father's birthday -- actually, one down now and two more to go -- but then what? ). Also, the cards that you purchase are on a separae CD, so you have to continually switch back and forth from the Creat a Party cd and the Art and More Store CD. Annoying! Also, there is no option to e-mail the cards as you can in other programs, but I do like having all of the other accessories, such as banners, cup covers, mobiles, signs, posters, caledars . . ."
5,Excellent guide for integrating Fireworks,"First, let me state this. I agree that the title can be misleading. That is why the old cliche should be heeded to; ""Don't trust a book by its cover."" I'm a web developer and consultant. I purchase many, many books, but I read the editorials and reviews before I decide to spend any of my money. In the Editorial Review by Amazon.com it says, ""It doesn't cover Dreamweaver in depth, but it does show how to integrate Fireworks into the Dreamweaver workflow..."" This was a flag for me to check it out more thoroughly.As for the content of this book, it hits the mark for showing a person the fundamentals of Fireworks. I'm a Photoshop user from way back but I love the seamless integration between Fireworks and Dreamweaver.I recommend this book added to the reference of any serious developer who is not focused on using any single brand ofapplications or programs and is adaptable of using different applications in their quest of web design and development.."
3,Really lacking Dreamweaver instruction.,"This book only seems to cover a couple of basic steps in the use of Dreamweaver, yet is filled with a plethora of knowledge for fireworks. I really expected a lot more from the manufacturer of the software, yet I was left hanging with a lot of questions as to how I can do certain things in DW.The lessons that ARE taught in this book are very helpful, but it's the material that is not covered that most people are actually looking for. The book is not that bad, but for the price, all readers wanting to learn Dreamweaver will be very disappointed."
4,X,"I just got the score of X-Men The Movie. It's by Michael Kamen, the one who did the nice score of Iron Giant & the amazing music of Event Horizon. This time, it's a little different from Iron Giant but it's nicely done and goes well with the movie. If you enjoy real good score with good ambiance & action, get this one. I enjoy it very much."
2,Only one side,"The books in this series are great, as far as they go.The problem is that they only show one side of the uniform.For painting miniatures, reinactors, and wargaming it is necessary to veiw both sides of the uniforms!The books are only half done! If, the books showed both sides of the uniforms and in the same pose, I would rate the series a five stars. But because the job is only half done, I rate them 2.5.I hope the publisher receives this feed back so this error will be corrected because the series is excellent, as far as it goes. It just needs the other side!"
4,A Wonderful Aromatherapy Therapy Resource,"I am a massage therapist and I bought this book to help me incorporate aromatherapy more into my practice.I was very pleasently surprised at the amount of information in this book. It's packed with how-to's, tips, guides, and pictures along with an abundance of information.I am a visual learner, so I was really happy that there are so many pictures depicting herbs, ancient applications, and modern techniques among other things.I bought this book used from an Amazon seller and it came in excellent condition.-The only thing I will say (and the reason I knocked it down a star) is that the authors have fallen victim to the scam that animal fats are bad for you and they consistently bring it up. For a traditional foody like me, it was quite annoying."
3,Misleading Cover photo but Correct Title,"I purchased this book, because someone wanted to have the same book I already had, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Essential Oils The Complete Guide to the Use of Oils in Aromatherapy and Herbalism by Julia LawlessUnfortunately for me, I paid attention to the picture of the cover of the book, which was the same as mine, the author, which was the same as mine, and the title was SIMILAR but not exactly the same as mine.It is NOT the same book.When I received it, the cover was completely different, purple and although it has SOME of the same information, it does not have ALL of the same information.However, it does have a very nice section on massage techniques. I'm almost inclined to keep this one and give my copy as the gift.But overall I'm disappointed that I did not get what I thought I was going to receive."
5,"Crisp prose. Bizarre, uncongenial subject adroitly managed","This man can write. I'm surprised to find most of his stuff only makes it to hardback or trade printings. His protagonist is interesting, the handling adept. Mr Vachss continues his war on child abuse"
2,so so album,kind of a little different sounding than the previous albums. not bad to listen to once in awhile but i prefer the other albums
3,Does what it's supposed to... nothing more,"If your battery has any juice left, it lights up the LED. If the battery is dead nothing happens. What an age to live in!"
5,Definitely helps with communicating!,"I think this book is great. Not only is it fun to read to see if your significant other has written to you, but it's very interactive and hard to get bored of. My boyfriend and I use it to communicate and talk about things we have a hard time telling each other face to face. It gives us a chance to get to know each other better and to make our relationship better because of our heightening communication skills. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has trouble communicating in a relationship. It's fun, you won't regret it!"
3,"A ""ALRIGHT"" ALBUM","No its not the best but it certainly isn't the worst! I only like some of Trisha's songs. The song ""How Do I Live"" was only OK sung by Trisha but AWESOME sung by LeAnn Rimes! The better songs on this album was ""She's In Love With The Boy"" and ""Perfect Love"" are the songs that help give this album three stars. There were a few ""alright"" songs as well but there weren't enough songs on this album. I guess you can say I'm far from being a hugh Trisha Yearwood fan!"
1,How Do I Live Without You? Damn Easy!!,"Trisha Yearwood is one of the most boring singers in country music. I always feel she is more interested in appealing to the critics than to the public. She's famous for claiming she only records ""positive"" songs for women and yet her biggest hit was the whiny, dependent HOW DO I LIVE WITHOUT YOU and to top it off she gets into something of a catfight with the other singer who put it out (Lee Ann Rimes, I'm not that crazy about her, either). She definately is the female Garth Brooks - arrogant, pretentious, unctuous. It was incredibly rude of both of them not to appear at the CMA Awards this last year - even if they hadn't been nominated again, they should have out of courtesy. I hope the issue won't pop up this year and they aren't nominated AT ALL."
4,Which version to buy.....,"This album contains many good songs, but I recommend you to buy the import version of this album instead. The import version contains a number of extra tracks, for example the beautiful song ""On A Bus to St Cloud"", written by Gretchen Peters and ""Believe Me Baby I Lied"". If you find an import album that isn't much more expensive than this one, buy it instead."
3,should maybe stick to making speed squares,"I will agree with both the other reviews, it is not a high quality level, but for the $17 I paid, I am not too disappointed. When it is at regular price, you can get a much better quality level for only a few extra bucks.But sometimes it is nice having a level around you aren't too concerned about. They tend to get beat up on a job site so it is nice not having to keep one eye on your level all the time. Or one to borrow out to your neighbor without worrying if you will ever see it again."
5,Timex Takes a Licking but Keeps on Ticking!,I bought this watch for my dad because he likes expansion band watches. He says the watch is great. He enjoys the large numbers which helps reduce eye strain to see the time. He likes to work outside and often his watch gets hit by objects but it keeps on working. He would definitely recommend this watch to anyone.
2,A disappointing Timex Watch,This watch disappointed me compared to Timex and other brands I have owned in the past. I could not wear this watch until I replaced its watch band. It was poorly engineered and constantly bit hair on my wrist. It is cheap looking in its overall appearance.
5,"NO ""HUNG DOWN HEAD"" ON THIS ONE !!!!!","This cd is a MUST HAVE for Lowell Fulson fans or anyone who loves the blues!!! 45 AWESOME cuts with Lowell's powerful VOCALS out front and leading the pack on every cut! A perfect mix of all-out and slow-tempo throughout! This will BLOW YOU AWAY, JUST GET IT!!! ( P.S. Excellent service from the folks @ rockaway!!! )"
4,need more carefull in shipping,"I just received the bos with 3 CD's, and one of them has the case broken, but the sound quality of the CD is very good, I think you can protect the product with other alternatives (plastic, etc)"
5,I LOVE my Q!,"Would have given a 4.5 for the battery issue, but once I upgraded it, it works fine. I don't talk a lot on mine, so maybe that is why it lasts longer. I travel a lot for my job, and use mainly for email, texting (get the extra plan if you do alot of this, 15 cents a text adds up!) and calling. My PDA has Windows Mobile 5.0 (AXIM x51v), so it is familiar. It has rebooted itself a handful of times which seems odd, but no blue screen of death, no dropped calls, no problem getting my email out or uploading pics and music. The Wireless Sync is fantastic. When I went to Chicago, I updated the info online (dates, hotel, etc.) and I got weather, maps and directions on my phone! Brilliant!My only complaint has been finding a pretty (pink) leather cover for it that will protect it and accommodate the extended battery! This is a fun phone, good camera, does what I need it to do and looks cool. I highly recommend it!"
1,Stay Away From the Q!,"The Q is a frustrating waste of time and money. I have also experienced many of the problems described in the other customer reviews: random crashes, slow service, non-existant battery life, etc.Do yourself a favor and get an iPhone or, if you need a device for business, a Blackberry. Compared to the Q, both are much better and more reliable alternatives."
4,Love Henrie O,"Carolyn Hart is one of my favorite authors in the mystery genre and she did not disappoint me with this entry in the Henrie O series. I enjoy this series as much as the Death on Demand series she writes and am always glad to see a new one coming out. In this episode, Henrie O is recovering from an illness and attends her former son-in-law's wedding on a resort island. A murder occurs and, of course, Henrie O works to solve the mystery. As always, Hart's writing is dead-on; her characterizations are excellent, there are clues to help the reader along without giving the solution away easily, and the descriptions of the surrondings are vivid enough to make the reader feel as if s/he knows where s/he is.Hart's next book is a Death on Demand book and I hope that the next one will be another Henrie O. It is nice to have the break between the episodes of the two series."
1,Waste of money,This book has a tiny bit of information - the kind you could get from the Yellow Pages. It's a crime she's actually selling it to people. We moved to Pasadena two weeks ago and I already know more than this book. Don't waste your money.
1,Scatterbrained,"I had this professor for a history of economics class and she writes just as she teaches; listlessly. She meanders all over the place and will often throw in what she perceives as relevant information, but isn't about her trip to the Great Wall of China in the middle of discussing the pyshiocrats. This book is bombastic in language, excessive in wordiness, and it will make you fall asleep by mid paragraph. Seriously, skip this book. It is by far the worst economics book I've ever read."
3,A hard but basic book,"History of economic ideas, thoughts and analysis has been analyzed by many, not only by economists, but also by historians, sociologists and people interested in history of ideas. In this sense, the book does not provide any new information. However, for students not familiar with the basic 101 in history of economics, it is as good as any other book. My major quarrel with the book is that it doesn't sufficiently place the given theories in their proper historical context some times, and therefore it is impossible to understand why people held the ideas they did. Overall it is a fair book, but it does not come close to Schumpeter's ""History of economic analysis"" or the more modern ones by people such as Landreth and Colander (""History of Economic Thought""). It is true that they also fail to place various theories in their context sometimes, but their breadth (Schumpeter) or pedagogy (Landreth-Colander) make them superior."
2,Not as expected,"I bought the game for $19.99...thinking that a brainless game would be a good break from thinking games. I mean it's Whac-A-Mole...how hard can it be? Because it's computerized, you get gold moles (more points), hairy moles (sucks points away), etc. There aren't ""in game"" instructions, so you have to keep the book nearby. Overall, I'm just not impressed...I wanted a chance to beat on some moles, not have to read a book in order to play. I could only figure out a couple of things on my own.Gameplay ends quickly if you don't read the book. Moles don't go away on first hit all the time (unless you hit the screen harder). I wonder about the long term effects that could have on the life of your Nintendo DS.I tried to get rid of the game at Game Stop a couple of days later...they are offering $2. I'll give it to a friend, hopefully her kids will have more fun with it."
3,"nice shower bar, missing chrome caps","Really nice shower bar, easy to install. However, the bar is chrome but it came with non chrome round caps for the mounts.Also, it's not obvious but the handle articulates to adjust the spray angle."
3,Wine Reference,This book definitely contained dated material. Very limited on content. Interesting to look at so I added to my reference library. Book arrived as described.
3,"better in greek, but still watch it","It's an amusing little story, and you can watch it in englishand be entertained. The problem here is not so much in a cultural barrier asin the way the movie is dubbed: Hollywood-bland and given stock readingsthat take the life out of it. To make it even blander they have taken some liberties with the script... in the one section I saw, where the girl and guyhave a somewhat thoughtful exchange, it's turned it into Hollywood pablum..So here's your choice: you can watch Alice in the Navy and listen tothis poor actress trying, or not at all trying, to be Aliki Vougiouklakior you can go on E-Bay and order a movie called Aliki sto Naftiko and hear the marvelous inimitable Aliki herself along with the excellent Greek cast.Make sure you specify sub-titles, of course..I only reviewed this because I hate to see it get one star..and it's alittle unfair to blame a movie entitled ""Alice in the Navy"" for the factthat it's not in Greek."
4,Recommended,"A Newbery Honor Book, but also a picture book. A boy and his stepfather grow closer when they realize they are more alike than they thought. Not a story you often run across in children's books."
1,Lost Fur,"I used this on my 3 animals. 2 dogs and my cat. They all lost some fur,I have used it in the past and it was great. Im guessing they went messing with a good thing. Whatever they did, It didn't agree with my animals at all. It makes me sad to see there suffering."
5,I love this knife!!!,I actually got this at LL Bean for $15 I got it as my second knife and I'v had it for five years.This knife is very dependable and a good sturdy fist knife for a kid. This knife was taken everywhere I went and dropped in the snow many times. This is getting pretty beat so I'm gonna replace it at LL Bean. I love this knife it may be small but it is so usefull! I am now 15 and I carry this around with me occasionally as an EDC knife. Also the pocket clip lets the knife ride very low and conceled in you're pocket. This is by far the nicest pocket clip I have ever seen in a knife.
5,His Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam rocks! Smart and down to earth guy.,"Great insight into a very intelligent, perhaps genius, entrepreneur and businessman that happens to be a reigning monarch. HSH Prince Hans-Adam is expressive here, very relaxed and rather frank in his discussion of his nation, his businesses, and in the state of the world now that we're facing increased terrorism. He talks about banking secrecy, rule of law, a new constitution, the nature of monarchy and history. He even let's us in on what he likes to read on his free time. This is a mind expanding peek into a great and business savvy monarch's mind."
1,SPORTSMANSHIP,"Mohomed Ali was a man who denigrated his opponents,who arragantly boasted about himself and his prowess,in interviews he would babble on almost incoherently about himself.The man sounded like a child who never grew up.His lack of sportsmanship and disrespect for his opponents showed his own lack of class.He was held to a lower standered simply because he is black.Rocky Marciano and Joe Louis were classy MEN who Mohomed could have emulated,but his huge ego prevented that."
4,Limp Bizkit - Take A Look Around,"This CD is pretty good. It is definitely worth the money to have the Mission Impossible song plus live versions of N2gether Now and Nookie. Nookie live is very cool. The song is extended and Fred does some ranting as only Fred can do. If you already have both the MI 2 Soundtrack AND Significant Other, then this CD probably isn't worth it. I only had SO, and its worth the price to get any live recordings -- since Limp is the best live."
5,Wish I had more stars,This are the very best sandles ever made. I wear this sandles ever day. I have bad foot and this feel better than any other.
2,Cool product but - Headphones didnt last,These headphones were perfect but the right headphone died after only using it for 2 weeks. I like my music loud and thought these could handle the fury of the iPod volume levels but I guess I was wrong. I recently picked up a newer iPod and am currently looking for a different headphone solution. Maybe some of the more expensive headphones from Shure or something.On the other hand if you listen to your iPod with medium levels youll love these but it just did'nt fit my needs and died because of that.Self discovery of faulty products leaves my wallet skinny.
4,A Poetic Tapestry,"""Moon Tide"" is an ambitious and complex first novel.The story describes fifty years of relationships among the year rounders and summer dwellers in the coastal town of Westport, Ma., culminating with the killer hurricaine of 1938. All of this is really besides the point, for the heart of the book is in the prose, poetry really, that the author sets down with richness and sensuousness that is rare in a young writer. Each sentence is meant to be taken in, chewed and ingested for its own content and beauty. As it is poetry, the tale itself unfolds slowly, the facts of the story subservient to the panorama of the land and sea, and the motion of the plot secondary to the loving description of the coast where it takes place.This is a serious book, which leaves us hoping for more good literary news in future works."
1,very low quality,"I purchased this tool, I figured I would spend a little more money and get a quality one. Not the case! All the adjusting knobs are plastic, even the scribe. The scribe is stuck and will not come out, you can not use pliers to pull it out because the part protruding is plastic not like what is pictured. All the edges are sharp and it is made from a poor casting to boot. The case it comes in was falling apart when I tried to open it lol! Don't waist your time on this one. I am a machinist and have purchased cheap ones that where much better than this one. I did not even take all the parts out of the case it was so bad. Sorry for the bad review but I would want the truth when I look at a review and this is my honest opinion."
4,"A cute, feel-good romance","A fun story about a jaded woman who has very cynical and hardened ideas about love and marriage, and the romantic man who sets out to soften her outlook and open her heart. Joe is a wonderful character - I could fall head-over-heals in love with him myself! I appreciated the gentle way he led Laurel to view love in a different light and come to her own conclusions, rather than force his ideals onto her. The dialogue was snappy and entertaining. The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is that the story could have been faster paced and told in 50-75 less pages."
2,Forced,"this book was very slow, and the main characters didn't have enough chemistry for my taste. the heroine is annoying because she tries to prove that she is right all the time, when clearly she is wrong. the book and the characters in it seemed forced. t"
4,Good Aussie Worship At It's Absolute Best!,"This album is an absolute beauty! Hills CLC is the birthplace of this generation of praise & worship. Who said all good music must come out of the US? (No offense intended) God is truly working all over the world, and look out world, Australia is about to see an unprecedented move of the Holy Spirit. ""All Things Are Possible"" is merely the tip of the new generation praise and worship style in Oz! ""So You Would Come"" would have to be one of the most anointed songs on this album, akin very much to the altar call favourite hymn, ""Just As I Am"". There is a real liberty in Hills CLC P&W - just as Jesus intended!!!"
2,"Praise not as high as previous CD: ""Shout to the Lord""",I had to continually replay the CD to capture the Word-which Hillsongs usually ministers with. Favorite song is title song.
5,IT IS MOTIVATED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT,"All things are possible is one CD that is packed with the people of God singing with an annointing that is so great, I can't expalin. It is an album that takes a believer into the Holy of Holies. Songs like So close and Be exalted just help me to see the awesomeness of God. One thing I have to add is whatever Darlene and the team have been doing (prayer, fasting, developing a passion for customer spiritual growth) whatever they've been doing to usher in the presence of God, they should keep up because like I said, This worship is the highest I've ever heard or experienced."
4,Tastes significantly better than microwave...significantly!,"I saw these reviews and thought ""great.. a popcorn that doesnt taste like plastic dipped in butter."" I made the mistake however of ordering the 40pack. I also ordered the Wabash butter flavored popcorn topping. I really dont eat popcorn that much so without question I ordered a lifetime supply's worth of popcorn. Once it arrived I cooked it in a pot and added the topping. I must say it comes pretty close to theater popcorn (but not enough that I'll order a 40pack again!lol) But it was good. The butter topping really makes it good. I would highly recommend you buy the topping. Overall, this is without question very good popcorn and blows away anything that is microwave. It only go's to show you, some things are worth the wait...."
4,yummy popcorn,This is my second order of this popcorn and I love it! I use it in the Wabash Whirly Popcorn popper and it comes out perfect everytime.I would highly recommend it if you like theater style popcorn.
3,Fun retelling of old themes,"Although not breaking any new ground in the fantasy genre, this short collection of stories makes for a fun and sometimes romantic read. The first fiction efforts by Wand Wolfe particularly capture the spirit of the traditional fairy tale (""Frong Prince"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"").Editor Cecilia Tan has put together a nice blend of stories that encourages me to read more of her anthologies."
2,"Ho Hum, I've read better","The author is the director of evangelism for the Navigators and a combat marine veteran of WWII. These two experiences have shaped his view of leadership. Unlike many other books on leadership, Eims has structured his book sole on leadership and management principles taken from the Bible.His belief that any pastor can be a better leader is the chief strength of this book. Eims points out that the source of spiritual leadership is not found in natural charisma, but in the infilling presence of God; thus, leaders in the church must be men of faith before anything else. They must set the example before the congregation of what it means to be a Christian.There were some significant weaknesses in this book. There were just too many sermons. Page after page is devoted to biblical illustrations. For instance, in chapter nine over three pages of biblical exposition are devoted to Moses resolving conflicts.It was an OK book, I've read better."
4,Brian Cox is Fabulous!,"I was bored last night so I decided to browse through Netflix Roku and came across this movie that I had never heard of before. I have to be honest, if it wasn't for the great acting and direction, this could have been a fair/poor formulaic movie that I would have soon forgotten. However, the acting in this movie was great. Brian Cox delivers an excellent performance that I will remember for a long time. In short - if you enjoy fine acting and dramatic thrillers I would definitely recommend this movie."
2,2.5 Stars...Nothing More Than A Made For TV Movie,"This movie was described as a thriller. It was far from that. It was a drama, and a slow one at that. Brian Cox is a great actor, but his old man, hum drum manor was a little monotonous. Cox's character, Avery's dog is shot by three punk teens. Low and behold two of the teens are rich kids. Daddy believes their lies about denial of the incident. Daddy then controls the town and sheriff and nothing happens to the boys. The story drags along. The gunfight was just plain ridiculous. The whole movie felt like a prime time made for TV movie. Nothing overly impressive, just something to watch to kill some time."
3,get what you pay for,"Very earthy and blah. If you use extra sugar in cappuccino it is fine. I am obviously not a connoisseur by any stretch of the word, but was not impressed by this espresso. It is also not as finely ground as I would expect and as espressos I have had in the past. I will not be ordering it again."
5,EXCELLENT FOR ALL AGES!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL KIDS OF ALL AGES! THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE COLORFUL AND THE STORY IS GREAT! MY NIECES LOVE IT AND READ IT EVERY NIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME, BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!! FOR ANYONE WITH KIDS, GRANDKIDS, NIECES NEPHEWS--OR EVEN YOURSELF!GREAT JOB AND I FOR ONE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE OTHERS TO COME OUT! AWESOME JOB ANNIE BELLE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Jack and Rose 10 years later,"Interesting though not altogether satisfying study of a marriage in crisis. Winslet and DiCaprio as the warring couple are excellent if a little bit too ""pretty"" for their roles. All their bickering becomes a little bit repetitive and depressing. But that this film makes you feel uncomfortable is no accident. It's an unusually mature examination of adult relationships."
5,"""The hopeless emptiness; Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness""","This movie is very close to my heart, or maybe to my dark side; contemplating many subjects like boredom, high expectations, and self destruction. Based on the novel by Richard Yates; I don't believe any other two actors could've done a better job than Winslet and DeCaprio.Love is not the magic cure for problems; sometimes it might make problems even worse. When two people are in love and faced with life's crisis, what are they to do? What are we to do, when our minds take a life of their own and our decisions are separated from our passion, and might lead to our moral demise? Watch this movie and question the story of what is life all about, or as Yates once said: ""Most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy."""
1,Why was this movie made?,"I found this film to be very depressing and of no social or moral value what-so-ever. April is sooo unhappy, yet we never see her playing with her children? She took no joy in having her kids? What kind of mother and wife is she? She is unhappy because she lives in suburban CT? What is sooo bad about that? Her unhappieness comes from within herself, not in her conformist surroundings. The ending is horrible and leaves me doubting April's sanity. Skip this film."
1,Slow and plodding - lame script,I mean REALLY slow and plodding. This is a snoozer. Acting is pretty good for a script that is really lame. I suspect this was adapted from a play. Whoever adapted it just doesn't understand how to write an effective script for a motion picture.
1,Lives of Quiet Desperation,"Great acting, but for what reason? Pass unless you want to be depressed and ""hopeless""."
5,"Revolutionary Road: Favorite film, 2008","I absolutely loved this movie and was disappointed it didn't get the Oscar love it deserved. When I first saw the trailer, I'll admit, despite a fantastic score, it seemed too ordinary. What I didn't take into account, and foolishly now in hindsight, was the chemistry between two of our finest actors fueling every scene, word and glance. Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio offer up a Master's class in acting. Just sit back and be mesmerized. You believe every emotion that passes between these two. Add a great supporting class (I found the repressed neighbors to be just as memorable as Michael Shannon), an incredible score, and confident, take-it-there direction, and you have my favorite movie of 2008. Highly recommend."
2,What exactly was the point?,"I love both of these actors SO much and wanted to like this film. When it was finished, it was ""what the""?? What WAS the point of this tedious film? They were unhappy in their marriage - we get that. Maybe it's another film that didn't serve the book well, I don't know. The whole film lacked heart and depth."
2,"If you want to be depressed, watch this film...","What a downer. Yes, the acting was superb, but why? Personally, I don't want to delve into the lives of two people going nowhere, who have every opportunity to change for the better but refuse or can't see to do so. If they had only listened to the ''crazy guy!I get what this film was about, but why? What is the point of re-hashing this tired old opinion of 1950's suburbia? When it was over, I just felt kind of angry at myself for wasting my time and felt cr@ppy for the rest of the evening."
1,just plain awful,"hate to disagree with so many others, but we watch this last night and my husband and I both thought it was totally awful.It was depressing and there was no real point to the movie other than showing a totally discontent marriage, people having affairs, and horrible language. Yey. It didn't even have any kind of take-away message.Maybe we missed something, but we would NEVER recommend this to anyone!"
5,Ironing Board Cover,"I've had my ironing board for probably 20 years and it has a squared-off front which I absolutely love since I use it more for quilting than for ironing clothes. After 20 years, it was time for a nice, new, CLEAN cover. My local sources didn't have a cover with the squared off end, so I checked for a cover manufactured by the same company that made the ironing board. I got it and I'm totally pleased with it. Because it gathers and ties rather than has any sort of elastic, I can get it completely tight. Some people might see a drawback to the fact that it isn't teflon, but I prefer the non-chemical material of the canvas. I will buy another one when this one wears out."
4,Melodically rich and emotionally satisfying,"While I have not yet experienced the grandeur of Yosemite National Park (some album tracks are named after places at Yosemite), memories of past visits to places of striking natural beauty, and fantasies of future wilderness explorations are evoked with ease and delight by the colorful and inviting strains of ""December Morning."" Tim Janis demonstrates not only his fine technical skill for composition and orchestration, but also a keen aptitude for crafting rich and beautiful melodies that are both intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying. This is my first experience of his music, and I look forward to enjoying to his other works."
5,Fun and engrossing to read! Terrific book.,"Best and most delightfully clear presentation of genetics and the potential for understanding our moods that I've ever read. If I taught a college course in Psychology, I would start by having my students read this engaging book!"
4,Making Big Stuff Smaller,"The book gives some excellent insights into how to take control of your random thoughts and fears and make them rational. It gives you processes and techniques you can follow to make sense of many concerns that, at first blush, seem insurmountable. Take the time to reread lines, passages or chapters that most apply to your circumstance at any given time, and you can achieve a sense of calm that helps you sort through the ""big stuff."""
2,Disappointed,"O.k. I am very happy for Lauryn Hill that she is growing spiritually and all that but I felt like this cd is laced with way too much Christian sap. I liked Lauryn Hill, the rapper, much more than this current version of her. These songs just kind of go nowhere and stay there. Practically every single one of them is ridiculous long and they just don't do it for me. Anyone who liked Miseducation of Lauryn Hill may find that this cd is not their style. It feels like I'm preached at rather than sang to and frankly, that just doesn't do it for me."
5,Amazing,"Just did a complete listen of this album. It's incredible. If you are looking for something anything remotely like her previous work, don't get this album. If you are looking for a heartfelt, incredibly talented, raw singer baring her soul, buy this album. Each track is interspersed with Lauryn talking about how she is no longer living in the fantasy world she once did as an ""entertainer."" You really have to listen to the whole thing to understand what she is really trying to get across.When I say raw above, I mean raw. Most songs are complete but there are a few where Lauryn makes mistakes or even stops the song and starts talking to her audience. She also cries a couple times at the end of the songs. This is someone who has really looked inside herself and just wants to tell us all what she has found. This is not an album, it's an experience."
5,Stop Looking for the same thing!,"Why don't some you give it a rest.I think that this Is a great cd.The probelm Is when someone tries to grow, we don't want to allow them that right.The last cd was great but, I can feel her when she says It was not her.A lot of what you see In music Is prepacked and It comes from the record producers and not the artist themselfes.When someone says that they are being honest who are we to say If is real or not?Also, all black people don't think the same so It Is not just white reviewers who may think a particular artist Is a(sellout).Some people lack understanding and when something flies over thier heads they attack It. That's fine If you don't like the cd , but please don't put all of us (black people)In your box and allow an artist growth,If that Is what they desire."
2,Too much talking,"Way too much talking (disc 2 opens with a 12-minute monologue, and there are others). Could have been a single disc - easy. Songs are good, not great - all sound similar - Lauryn's not real versatile with her guitar. Overall: disappointed."
5,much more intimacy than the television could allow,"this is a very intimate release.. beautiful, simple.. and just directly from her soul at times.. i'm so glad she decided to release her unplugged performance.. i watched it when it first aired.. and was i awe of how simple and lovely it was, even though severely stripped down (compared to the production i usually associate with a lauren hill cd)..some of these songs seem to contain a virtual dictionary of her life.. as she throws endless words at you.. but it works.. you never really notice.. and often.. you are wanting more..so.. this is a wonderful cd (cds, actually).. and i highly recommend it to ANYONE that loves music"
2,Like an ad for Prozac...,"I have rarely been so disappointed. A couple of the songs are first-rate but her voice sounds shakey and her guitar playing is not accomplished enough to support an entire concert. More importantly, I find it incredibly offensive that she holds the audience hostage to her ramblings about how hard her life is as a millionaireGrammy Award winning superstar. She clearly has mental health issues, she should take care of them, put them into her music and not expect the rest of us who live paycheck to paycheck to waste our time pitying how hard it was for her to have a staff of 40....She's become ridiculous. In her 1998 song ""superstar"" she critisizes pop stars for having ""no concept of reality..."" Maybe she should listen to that one again."
3,It's good,"I don't have access to MTV2 so I bought the album not knowing what to expect. It was definitely rough, and yeah, some of the interludes could've been left out, but tracks like ""Adam,"" ""Water,"" and ""Lion"" were all really rich in lyric and performance. I would have preferred a final studio cut on her new materials but if this is what she decided to put out, so be it. Lots of people are giving her [hard time] for not putting out a more professional disc, but considering all the great stuff she's already generated and shared with us, I think fans and the rest of the general audience can cut her some slack. While Lauryn's new songs may lack the ambient grooves and crisp production that we've become so accustomed to hearing from her; Lauryn's heart, penetration, and fluidic charge are still present as ever. It's a good album."
3,"Would be amazing, if she could keep her chat to a minimum.","This album aggravates me to no end. Maybe it's because I feel the need to compare it to 'the miseducation of lauryn hill', or maybe it's because her throwing in her high-as-hell opinions and rambling thoughts between and during songs hits a bad itch with me.The rambling and opinion Ms Hill expresses in this album make me cringe. She sounds like a go-nowhere pothead, like she's inflicting her thoughts and need to talk on you and it's nothing very particularly interesting. It makes me want her to get on with the music.The songs are good, but to me, it's not worth the frustration of her unqualified commentary."
5,Just Buy It,"Amazing - that's all I can say. Intimate, spiritual, and powerful. Just buy it and find out for yourself"
1,Why? Lauryn why?,"I did not read any reviews I went out and got this album. Now I was not expecting Misdirection 2 but I did not expect to hear Miss Hill ramble on and on about her awakening. The songs were good but She got in the way of her music. I mean good for you Lauryn, but face it we buy your albums because we like your music, if you don't think you should protect your voice (your God given gift, if you will) and show us some respect and dress up to perform, tell me what are you doing here? Miss Hill needs to get over herself and soon. If I want salvation I know where to find it. If she wants to talk about her life she should write a book."
4,Not what you expect,"Well, id assume most people would have already heard ""into the light"" & are looking at this as an addition since they loved that album so much. Dont expect an ""into the light"" feel at ALL. This cd sounds like it traveled through time from the mid 50's with dark.... very dark & sad tunes all the way through. Not what you'd expect if you only know ""into the light"". This also goes for their other full release, ""broken promise land"" as well. They could be concidered a pair since they follow eachother much closer than ""into the light"". Theres slow, sad, crooning sounds throughout the album from start to finish. Im telling you, if you like Magnus' voice then do what you can to buy their other Cd's. this will put you in a lounge mode but dont expect to feel anything less than sad after listening to it because Magnus delivers the goods (as usual). just dont go spending 100$ on HERE for it when you can use Ebay or some other way of purchase fopr about 20 to 30 $ ...tops!"
2,Disapointing!,"Another of these conspiracy books based on sketchy details and plenty of imagination. The author doesn't show much material on which he can make so much of his assertions and in the areas which he does their source is doubtfull.So having wasted a week reading this book I was glad to move to another one! I gave it two stars because my interest in Medieval British history is limited, so to conver what possible biases I may have had I added an extra star.Contrary to readers below, there is nothing in this book that blew me away. Usually with the conspiracy books (even the most out of this world ones) they have to convince me for 5 minutes for me to enjoy the book. This book did not do that."
5,Excellent!,"This book really gives the picture of how ""Empoyees"" can make a difference, given the chance! I suggest ALL managers ans supervisors read this and apply it. Making employees feel they are part of the solution and not the problem will change their whole attitude about themsleves and their company."
1,Fish Wrapper,"Yes, you can judge a book by its cover. Just as when a person tells a tall fish story this book also falls flat at the end. At least when you get a fish there is meat on the bone, but this ""little"" book is not worth the money or the time spent reading it."
1,Review of CD,"The CD set is 3 hourit has the feel of a bad Human Resource video on office rules.It is read from scipts and sounds as such ....10 minutes into the First CD I ejected it from my Car's CD player.....Even in a captive environment ......it got the ""boot"""
4,Very usable,It's real good quality and very usable product.I'm using it each morning and very satisfied.I'm recommending it for all runners.
5,Ipod Armband,I love this product. I bike ride every day and I haul my ipod in the arm band and away I go. When listening to tunes I could ride forever. Great product.
3,Wrong Product but Good Solution,"I ordered two Nike Sport Armbands but only found out after I received the product that the armbands were designed for an earlier version of the iPod Nano.To the company's credit, they were more than willing to give me a refund for the products and did so in a timely manner."
2,so so,"When I first got this I was at first kind of bummed out. It says it fits the iPod Nano. It doesn't fit my Nano, it only fits the older white gum stick shaped iPod, the shuffle. Maybe there's a version of the Nano thinner than mine..whatever.Luckily, I had a shuffle stashed away. So, one count against.Then I realized once the shuffle is inserted, the placement of the button is wrong. You have to insert the shuffle upside down so the ear bud cord comes out properly, which puts the button on the front of the armband in the wrong place.Count two against.Every tried to wrap a stretchy thing around your arm with one hand. Guess what, it takes two hands.Count three against.I will give the armband a point or two for being incredibly cheap.I use it for a run daily as it does stay on my arm. I wouldn't recommend it to you dear reader, or anyone else unless you simply want something cheap. It fills that bill."
5,Great for toothpick arms!,"I went through about 4 armbands before finding this one. All of the armbands I had purchased previously claimed they would fit my twiggy runner's arms. While most of them did fit my arm initially, after about 20 strides they rode down my arm and wound up dangling around my elbow.This is the only armband I've found so far that will stay put on my arm even at a full-out sprint. It's composed of polyester, spandex, nylon and velcro instead of neoprene and velcro. The stretchiness provides a snug fit, and it's lightweight to boot.I should add that I don't even have an iPod Nano. I own a different mp3 player, but it fits inside the armband just fine. I think that this would work for any player that's about the size of the Nano or smaller. Some of the controls obviously won't be in the exact same place as they are on the Nano, but for me that's no big deal."
3,buttons don't line up,"It's ok to carry my IPOD, but the buttons don't match up, so I start the IPOD, lock it, then put it on."
5,Beautifully Written!,"""WT"" = Walks Through Napoleon & Josephine's Paris, Diana Reid Haig; The Little Bookroom (2004)(To the publisher, The Little Bookroom; 05/15/10 EM)""Dear Little Bookies:""Just finished ""Walks Through Napoleon & Josephine's Paris.""""Splendid writing (incapable of improvement); stunning art work; and the two methods of presentation are flawlessly integrated.""With appreciation of the good luck I had when I found WTN&J;, and wishing you the same, sincerely...""And the best part was that it flushed out the psychic damage done by that learnedly incompetent biography of Sumner Welles (a 380-page literary Bataan Death March). Unfortunately, another horrid Preakness race is being run today & the damage done - ""This is NBC, at Pimlico, bringing you the second leg of the Triple Crown from a permanent slum!' - cannot be countermanded by any known author."
2,Disappointing!,"I got this book on the advice of a friend and boy am I disappointed and wish I had not bothered.For me it was a waste of money for two reasons. One, I was hoping for more advice on a picky eater and there just isn't a whole lot in this book. Two, many of the recipes are nothing that my toddler would eat, and many aren't recipes I'd even want to bother with creating. I have a toddler, I don't have an hour to prepare a lunch for him. Overall I was just really hoping for something that would give me some advice and tips on how to get a infant, toddler to try new recipes and foods. No luck here!"
4,Sherman,I found the book entertaining as well as informative about General Sherman and some of the other personalities and events of the Civil War. The author has done an excellant job of researching his topic. It will be best received by readers who are true history buffs.
5,Buy this Cd now!,"This is Dan Swano's follow up album to his first ""Nightingale"" side project ""The Breathing Shadow"". The first album had a little more energy but I would have to say this cd is twice as good. The songs are a tiny bit more laid back with a great tone. The drumming is 20 times better, especially since it doesn't sound like it's all synthetic from a drum machine, and Swano's talent just keeps growing as he writes more songs and albums. The first song ""Deep Inside of Nowhere"" rocks and the cd just progressively gets better until the last song! If you like Swano's work I still suggest checking out the ""Dan Swano - Moontower"" cd, the best of all his work, well maybe I shouldn't go that far but that cd does KICK ASS! As for this ""Nightingale"" cd, BUY IT TODAY!!!"
5,AWESOME!,"This new single rox. it's going to be a great cd when it comes out. their new music is great. the song can i get your number is such a good song, upbeat. i love it! go see these guys in concert if you can, when they do this song, theres a really cool dance to it!"
4,Why don't more people know about Mary Griffin?,"Mary Griffin has an amazing voice. This single cd showcases her definitive song, ""Perfect Moment."" I love this song. Ms. Griffin sings it beautifully, and there are definite catchy hooks in the groove. The only problem is the mixes sound the same. There really is no huge difference between each and that's too bad. Sometimes, remix cds have mixes that are as different as night and day. Unfortunately, this cd single is not one of them. Don't get me wrong, there is a bit of house, dub, dance, but they sound like the same thing over and over.Someone, out there in this great, big, world of ours should remix this cd ... again. Until then, this will have to do."
5,Best Clean-smelling Cologne!,"This smell is somewhere between a fresh bar of soap, clean linen sheets and smooth citrus notes. There is nothing out there that smells quite so classic and clean, so you cannot compare it with any other cologne. It's the un-cologne (kind of like 7-Up was the UnCola back in the day - think 1980s). Never overpowering, overbearing or cloying. Just what I was always looking for in a cologne, but never knew I wanted.Wear this, and you are virtually guaranteed not to smell like the next guy."
5,Absolutely great planters.,"I bought 2 of these planters over a year ago. Highly recommend them. They are very attractive, sturdy, and roomy. Easy to keep clean. I only wish the deer didn't like them so much..."
4,Tight Bag that Does the Job,"Would highly recommend this product, as it provides a tight fit to the camera. It should work with the conversion tube if you point the camera up or down. It has pockets for the cables and the SD cards. Compact in that you can either carry it like a purse, or put it through your belt loops, which is real nice. Rated it a 4 vs. a 5 because I thought I would be able to carry the camera with another lens connected, which you can't."
4,Good for superzooom fz40,I bought this for panasonic fz40. Its camera just fits perfectly without you having to push it or anything. The front pocket fits the charger and an extra battery. I wish there was a little place to keep the lens hood. Its small and compact so its easier to carry around.
5,Possibly The Best Song Ever Written,"Well although this album has only one track dont be fooled!This is a masterpiece, 40mins of absolute brilliance!If you love bands like opeth with genuine song writing ability, this is most definately for you!*****"
3,Received a damaged globe.,"Don't get me wrong, it okay but not worth the price as far as I can see. Also it arrived damaged, The lamp post on the globe was broken off and since it was so close to Christmas we didn't have time to send it back to replace it so I used super glue to attach the lamp post back on. Now it's kind of leaning. Not sure how it got broken since it seemed well packed. I believe whoever put the actual globe in the styrofoam must have broken off the lamp post. Not happy with that but don't want to go through all the hassle of packing it back up to replace it. For $35 I don't feel it was worth it but then again maybe if it arrived not broken."
5,Book to lift up Soul,"Muhammad Ali... great personality, men with heart, through fight and believe in God, he live his life.Book is written in very easy language, just enjoyed a reading and lifted up my Soul.This book will always be like guide for living for me :)"
5,Two Words: Out Standing!!!,"I could go on for days about the musicianship, melodies, production values, and overall quality of this album. However, most of the other reviewers have already done that. So I'll just add my $.02 by saying that this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I can't stop listening to it. I hope they eventually come to So. Cal so I can check them out live!"
4,Perfect Laptime Book,"For toddlers, this will be a favorite. Study slobberproof pages, bright colors,lots of details( how many daffodiles, robins chirping, butterflies, frog friends, too many dandelion seeds to count?) and the friendly little bunny in red overalls. It's stood the test of time since 1963, and will surely become a new generation's beloved naptime story."
4,A good introduction,"This easy to follow introduction to Tai Chi presents a safe introduction. It is easy to follow, low impact, slow paced and yet still a work out.It does seem that one would soon want something more.After about the 4th time you do the DVD you will probably want to turn off the sound, but that's pretty common. It works well for senior adults with the warning to stay within their own limits and slowly progress."
1,"Whatever it is, it's not Tai Chi","This was a complete waste of money. The routine was simplistic and repetitive. This wasn't a work-out. There was no spirituality to the session. Whatever it was, it wasn't Tai Chi."
2,For the old-fashioned man,"Nothing very compelling about the information or it's delivery. You can find the factual stuff in general purpose books, and the advice for men is really geared towards the clueless lout who doesn't understand why his SO doesn't feel like making love five times a week anymore"
4,Chilling!!!!,"In the summer of 1967, four young professional men rent a beach house at which to spend their weekends. One night for kicks they create a makeshift Ouija board, and to their suprise, conjure actual spirits of drowning victims - with nightmarish results, shadowing their entire summer and their lives beyond their beach house. Two more things make this book exquisitely frightening: One, that despite sensing the evil, these guys can't seem to quit; and two, that this story is non-fiction."
5,fan,"Very good book and as usual couldn't put it down, if you like Ed McBain you will enjoy this book. He was a very good author."
2,Maps Lack Basic Addresses,"I've used my Gamin Nuvi 370 for two months now, and have found that the maps are depressingly incomplete, often lacking the most basic of addresses. Major streets can't be found. This morning I entered the address of a major metro stop on the DC systems and it couldn't find it. Google Maps and Mapquest find the missing addresses without problem. The situation might be resolved with a map update, but the update downloads are not ""currently"" compatible with the MAC OS, something that wasn't included in the purchasing information.I've tossed mine into the bottom of the drawer and will go back to Google Maps."
4,help me... maps,"Hello good night.I'm a customers from venezuela, I want to know if this product garmin 370 including the map of venezuela, colombia, bolivia, brasil, ecuador.... I like to travel a lot for that reason I want to buy this item..Please the persons bought this item told me if have full all the maps of this countries.. ThanksRegards from venezuela"
5,AN AMAZING LITTLE ASSISTANT!,"This is really an amazing and usful instrument for anyone who likes exploring Europe by car. I have visited 6 countries with this GPS and it took us everywhere to the front doors of almost all the hotels except one. It also takes us to all the sights and the nearest Metro stations in paris, Vienna.It also takes you turn by turn with street names even thought the pronounciation is not always correct. It definitly cannot speak French, nor Italian!However, it does not have the latest road informations in Slovenia and Croatia yet good enough to go to the major cities, streets and sights.The only downside is sometimes it does not always give you the shortest directions all the time, just most of the time."
4,GPS System,Being stationed in Germany this helps me to learn my way around because Europe has many different languages and different signs.
3,Nuvi Review,"I have only used the Nuvi a couple of times but right off the mounting arrangement could be better. With todays cars having fast sloping front windows the Nuvi winds up very far away from the driver. Makes it darn hard to see what is going on or to change something. Fortunately, the vocal directions save the day. So far the routing seems to be very good as the few times I have used it, it seems to have taken me by the most direct and quickest route. More use of it will tell the whole story."
5,Amazing product at a decent price,"I had a choice of the Nuvi 360 vs. Nuvi 370 and with european maps preloaded, getting the 370 made more sense. Getting the european maps separately costs over a 100$. This also has a traffic receiver which is NOT integrated. It is a separate attachment which is pretty small, nevertheless not integrated. Voice prompts are great and I haven't tried listening to music or an audiobook but the good part is that it will stop playing when it has to mention the next turn and will resume play after that.Great product!"
4,Trust but verify,"I've had the unit for a few months. It changes the way we drive in that we can focus more on the road and less on the signs. Unfortunately, it does makes mistakes. On more than one occasion we were told to get off at places that made no sense. When I knew the roads, I just ignored the instructions but it's not so great when one doesn't know the route.What I like most is that I use the unit to listen to my audio books and the unit cuts in rather talks over the speaker. I believe that makes for a safer trip.Some of the interfaces are not as smooth as they could be. For example, when placing a call it should assume you want to call the place you're driving to as a default. It doesn't.Overall, I like it very much."
1,Fraud,"Do not buy this book if you plan on learning any tying tricks with cdc. Only a few tying instructions are illustrated, and these are eigther very basic or simply bad patterns. There are only a couple of pictures of decent flies, without any further tying techniques revealed. Many of the flies covered in this book have prooven themselves as excellent patterns in their original state. Not all patterns were meant for cdc! On the other hand it seems like a lot of emphasise is put on the historical aspect of cdc emerging as a fly tying material. I really don't see how that is going to help me tying flies with cdc."
2,love among thieves,"Probaly Audrey Hepburn's worst ever film; it seems like the only reason she made it is that the co-star was her neighbour when she lived in Switzerland, and she liked his tv series."
2,Exercise in Self-Absorption,"This book began with an interesting premise- the incidence of depression and other mental illness over six generations of a family. Because the family had a somewhat famous ancestor, it was possible to assemble information going back that far. Unfortunately, the author seemed to finish by writing a different book, basically an autobiography that, while filled with much detail, wasn't very interesting. The early parts were well-written, the later ones less so."
3,Starts out strong...,"I was very excited about this book, and the first half of the book lived up to my expectations.The second half, the book fizzles and becomes quite boring, and feels as though the author is struggling to flesh out his book.Nice read, not great though."
1,Casio men's Forester Watch-Not Worth it!,"Don't bother with this watch, you will be annoyed at it because:1.The analog hands ALWAYS cover something on the digital display2.The analog hands are superfluous-bad design3.The thermometer shows a temperature of 84.2, my body temperature is 98.6 whereas the room temperature is 71, what temperature is 84.2 which the watch displays and what is the use of it?4.The watch does not display the year and month5.No indication anywhere of the expected battery lifetime under average conditions6.No indication anywhere as to what type of battery is used by the watch"
5,Best watch i've see,"This watch is a weather station,tne temperature ehat show is correct and the tide and moon phases"
5,Excellent Read!,"What can I say? FAB is such a breath of fresh air in the claustrophobic world of chick lit. It does not reinvent the wheel, but it gives it a fresh coat of paint and brand new spokes. It is especially great because it's REAL: throughout the many mentions of the latest fashions and trends, it reveals the all-too-painful vulnerabilities of those who struggle to have something substantial they can count on. Everyone knows somebody with a little bit of Carolyn, Taylor, Bianca, or Roxanne inside of them. Plus, it's HILARIOUS. Go pick it up TODAY!!"
2,Tonight I said Goodbye,"I was disappointed with this novel, the first of Michael Koryta's which has not lived up to my expectations. The emotional situations did not ring true, and I found myself skipping through sections. Previously, his novels have always been singular, distinctive- this one read like it could have been written by any number of other, not-so-clever authors."
5,Great first effort,This kid has talent. This is supposed to be the first of the series and it was very well done. I'll be following this one
3,Not Bad for What It Is,"I read this book because it received rave reviews, and because I like novels set in places other than New York or Los Angeles. It was an acceptable read, but I didn't find it riveting or compelling. There's nothing about the characters or plot that strikes one as deep or original: everything seems stock, or as if it came from watching television rather than from reading classic private eye fiction."
5,Company Aych,"I found this to be an excellent insight into the way people thought about the world at the time of the Civil War. It made fascinating reading and from a modern perspective, barely believable at times. My reading was fairly uncritical but I will re read it again and again. Thought provoking an an excellent example of "" history from below."" I would recommend this book as part of any study of historiography."

4,LOvE this series!,"It's about time there was a series with a large sized woman who is smart, sweet, and beautiful!! It's too bad though that the man she loves won't ever go for any but a skinny blond"
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"It works OK . . . and that's about the best I can say about it. Too bad TEAC's stuff had to turn to crap several years back....they used to have some really nice stuff....now it's the same mass produced cheap consumer electronics garbage as all the other popular name brands. I have the same volume control, AM/FM reception, and background hiss issues as some other reviewers, and am thoroughly unimpressed. However, if you're on a budget, it's a good price and it'll do."
3,Good enough,"Adequate. Don't lose the remote control; it has a mute button that is missing from the receiver itself. The speaker binding posts are the cheapest, flimsiest excuses for binding posts that I have ever seen, and I've seen many. They are still better than the alternative, though."
4,"Average sound, loud, Stereo only, great buy","I got this for my workout room, suround sound was not needed, and for that, this stereo works great. I wouldnt recomond it for your primary stereo, because the sound quality is'nt the best. It gets pretty loud thru an average set of speakers, great for running:-) If your looking for a second stereo or great sound quality is'nt that important this is a great little buy. Oh yea the remote works great also."
1,Teac AG-790A Stereo Receiver.,"I have been very unsatisfied with this purchase. At the time I purchased it, I had to have major surgery and I was not able to hook it up immediately. When I hooked it up, I found that it was strong in the base and treble but very week in the midrange. I could not find where there was any warrenty on it so I have been stuck with it. I do not use it for that reason."
5,Perfect,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for my needs, I replace a 25 year old receiver, I didn't want anything too fancy, and I still wanted to play my old LP's. The sound is great and the price was right! Thanks Amazon."
1,It broke after 3 months,"I bought this receiver in May 2006 (made in China....).It broke in Aug due to no signal could be sent to speaker. The same situation also happened 1 month ago, but in that time it played again next day. However, this time it broke completely. I will replace it.As my opinion, the quality of this receiver is not reliable."
2,Very little ink...,"I ordered 2 scents. One had no ink, this one contained very little. I have to press 3-4 times to cover the stamp with enough ink. Obviously, quality control is an issue."
2,Ehhh,"It was ok . Doesnt smell like grapes which is whateverThe main picture has grapes on it they areSelling it for the ""smell"" that comes with itSo one would believe it would smell .Maybe i got an old one that lost the smell .Its ink is fine the colour is ok"
1,Grossly inaccurate,"Although the book does contain truthful and revelant empirical raw data, the author severely slants the truth (and even sometimes makes half-truths to the point of incorrectly naming Presidents) to the point of satisfying her own argument. Although Castro may very much enjoy her deptiction of the sustained need for socialism, my exiled family as well as my Cuban colleagues find the book disheartening as it weaves a fairytale for Castro as the glorious Savior of the Republic. The fact is that although the Republic did need change, it needed sustained political evolution, not revoltuion as found in the Castro regime. As my family is and comes from a family of Cuban politicians trying to advocate such change, her book is a tragic misinterpretation of those great ideals the infant Republic was trying to accomplish. If you are interested in knowing more about what actually occurred, not some socialist propaganda, watch Andy Garcia's movie The Lost City."
4,Nice product,"Seems to work very well, I've used this for about two years now after reading about it in a Volvo site.Not liquidy or greasy like the other products I've used."
4,cute book,"a very good book, as it explains heradlry terms, and makes it simple to create your own device.pity amazon so hard to deal with if not in america"
1,Why no unanimous assent to historical Parousia???,"Unless 70AD 2nd Coming of Christ has as much historical eyewitness documented undeniable inscripturated apostolically witnessed Holy Spirit-attested evidence as unequivocal fact to the degree that Incarnation, Miracles, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension have across denominational lines of Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox Christendom, any variant of Pastism, preterism, fulfilled historicism is D.O.A."
1,What A Shame,"The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a simple message meant for ALL to hear. John Noe, a highly educated man, takes the Bible, and makes it very complicated and difficult to understand. To understand his book, I think you would have to have a degree equal to his masters.He attempts to destroy the very core of the Bible by convincing his readers that the ""end of the world"" has already come - and there will be no ""rapture"" or catching up as referred to in 1 Thes 4:17. He makes it all so complicated that the average reader would probably just assume he's right - simply because they can't understand what he's writing."
1,AUTHOR DEBUNKS HIS OWN ARGUMENT,"The bible is very clear that false teachers will emerge in the final days that attempt to disguise lies and deceit beneath the ""blanket"" of Christianity. In attempting to make a case that we are not in the ""final days"", Noe is further fulfilling prophecy that indeed we are. His conclusions are misguided and not consistent with Scripture.Stay away from this book. It is simply another vain attempt to discredit the bible and that, which is painfully obvious."
2,will only watch it once,it's a good idea of exploring new place for climbingbut honestly it's quite boring for the whole film.and not many good climbing problems included
1,Bag O Sha 2005,"Let's drop the average for Lenny's book a notch for his panning of the great movie Kingpin, which does have heart, contrary to what this buffoon says. It seems that all of Lenny's taste is in his mouth.Bah.Save you pennies and visit some online dvd-review sites as well as reading other customer views, it will certainly be more comprehensive."
1,Print and book size,If you buy this book be sure you have a very good magnifying glass. The pages have been reduced in size and the print is extremely small. They have also reduced the number of entries by thousands. The price has been reduced so that is a plus. Keep your old book.
5,One of the best Movie Guides,"I don't think anyone could find a more economically price guide for movies, with such good coverage of: Directors, Actors, a synopsis of the storyline, and star rating system. I don't rent a movie without first checking out what Leonard Maltin has written about it. Highly recommend."
3,Civic insert,"The insert are great but, is very important if you want performance or confort. The insert are not made for confort just performance, once you install this insert you feel the engine inside on your car, the vibration in the steering wheel and in all the car. I need new engine mount and I end up buying the new engine mount and taking off this insert, they are really uncofortablefor the daily driving, they are great for race track and only for that."
2,The author spends too much time trying to justify use of JTA,Far to much of the book is spent explaining why the old way of telephony programming is bad and trying to justify why JTAPI is good. In doing so the author is often doing apples to oranges comparison (an old DOS based API to JTAPI). Yes JTAPI is better than DOS but then how many large-scale telecom applications where implemented in DOS? If you can past by the biased preaching the middle chapters do provide many code examples.
5,Love this doll!!!,"This doll is extremely cute, well made, and I love that it's a little boy! I bought it for my son, and he loves it! Highly recommended! It is so soft and cute, you will love it!"
5,Great brother for Stella,I purchased this doll for my 20 month old for her birth present from her baby brother. He goes great with Stella. Very cute and soft!
5,Perfect baby for my son,"I bought this because I wanted a boy doll for my 2-year-old son. It's durable and very soft. I also like that the diaper has Velcro tabs so we can easily ""change"" the baby over and over again."
5,Revenge Is Sweet,"The Sisterhood is at it again and the revenge will be even sweeter then it was in Fern's First book Weekend Warriors.To the outside world Dr.Julia Webster is married to a senator who has given Julia a ""gift"" that is going to change her life fovever.The mission the sisterhood has to accomplish is not easy but seeking revenge will give them the stregnth and courage they need to prevail in the mission.The book is FANTASTIC and once you start you will be hooked until the very last page.Now we have to sit back and wait for the next mission."
5,PAYBACK,ORDERED THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON BUT WAS SOLD FROM SUPER-FLY-BOOKS AS USED. IT WAS LIKE BRAND NEW. I WOULD DEFINATELY ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Poorly organized, bad grammar","This book covers a vast array of networking topics, and can serve as a quick primer or reference. However, the depth of treatment varies inexplicably: some areas are explored in way too much detail for an overview text, while others don't have enough information to provide a good basic understanding of the subject. The quality of the text is extremely poor: there is hardly a paragraph without multiple grammar, spelling and punctuation errors, which is very annoying. Another major drawback is the lack of a glossary; by the nature of the subject the book is peppered with acronyms, and looking them up in the index is tedious, because there are many references for most terms and no way to know which one points to a definition.Not recommended."
5,Great looking cocktail shaker,The design is very nice and the glass was clear once we rinsed them off after removing them from the box.
1,This is just a bad movie.,"Whomever made this movie, should not make movies. We get alot of ""wierd"" visuals, and thats it. Biggest waste of time I have spent. So the conclusion still is, unfortunately, if you want Lovecraft read the books."
2,Totally Cthululess.,"Cthulhu Mythos fans will be badly disappointed by this one. Only things it has to do with the Cthulhu mythos or Cthulhu are a few place names. It was actually kind of boring. Watched it once, couldn't see myself watching it ever again, so straight into the trash it went."
1,Out of date info,"This book has information that is out of date. There is little, if any, revisions to accomodate modern poultry production. I have even found references in other books referring to what this book has wrong. If you like to read historical accounts, this may be for you. I wouldn't attempt to apply much of what I read in today' world, though!"
3,Didn't Hit the High Notes,"This book does have a solid base, and easily covers all of the requirements for the DB2 Fundamentals exam. However, it begins to come up short for the DB2 Administrator test. Many areas are not particularly well explained, and the description of the DB2 product family is a complete hash job, and really leaves you none the wiser.Perhaps the most annoying part of this book is that there is no public errata, and I quickly found two errors. Given that this is a certification book, it's crucial that it's accurate. The author e-mailed me and pointed out that the mistakes were corrected for the Version 8 book, and that the publishers didn't give them any web space for an errata.Overall, a good book. However, a book written by IBMers on an IBM product for an IBM exam should be final word on the subject. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and I would suggest looking at the 'All in One' Gold books."
5,A good old romp through old England,I really recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in theater or just likes a fun book!
4,Good Story but the book failed to separate fact from fiction,"Overall I liked this book's fast paced action, but it always seemed to be fact and fiction at the same time. However, I would recommend this book."
3,Good- Not great,This book's plot is good but there isn't really the right words. Instead of using 'you' like this book did it should be thy or thee.The plot was an orphan boy went to one guy's house where he learned a writing language that us really quick to write then another guy can and bought him. The guy that bought him made him copy shakespere's Hamlet in the language. When he loses the notebook that the script was in he joins the actors and is actully in Hamlet. Will he get the script to his new master? Read this book to find out.
1,"advertised as versatile, but none of the features are really useful","It has a iPod dock, but the iPod can not be used unless you computer are connected;It has a speaker with a subwoofer, but the sound quality is of such inferior quality, it is worse than any $10 speaker you can get in the market;It's image quality of among the average, not as sharp as NEC or SamsungIt simply make no sense to buy such a thing at a price $200 higher tahn its competitor, without a single feature impressive, and worth the investment."
4,One important message,"This book gave me one important message; if you write, you are a writer. Being a writer is not about being published but rather being the kind of person that makes sense of the world around them through writing. Goldberg reinforces the classic writers guidelines ie. commitment to writing, being free with yourself, not letting the pen stop etc. However, I had difficulty with Goldberg's voice in the text; she seems to be a trendy, flightly, new-ager and not the kind of person I'd like to spend time with. But hey, like she says, ""we are not our work""."
3,Nice ideas but lots of redundancy,"This book consists of a series of very brief (generally less than 3-4 pages) chapters, each of which tells a little story about writing. After about 10-15 of them, however, I felt that I wasn't reading anything new. It was the same thought, ""just write,"" told in many different ways. Therefore, I would rate it highly for its message, but my average rating is due to its being overly repetitious."
5,The Best Writing Book I've Ever Read,"The prose alone of this author was enough to keep me reading. Her voice is authentic and her advice sound. After a ""dry spell"" in my own writing, this book reached me on levels where my muse lay in wait...The author does not fill up pages with didactic exercises, but offers suggestions to get you going and keep you going. She reaches into the heart of a reader and thrums a beat. More than a book on writing, she reaches into why you write and rekindles the romance."
3,Feel it in your bones,"Ms. Goldberg takes us through the easy answers about how to avoid bad writing and gets right down to the bones. She clearly lays the groundwork for soulful, insightful writing that will captivate your readers. But it's hard work. Natalie doesn't let us shirk. That she is a worthy mentor is abundantly clear as you read her book. Her sentences are clear and easy to read, yet flow smoothly on leading you through the story and her thoughts. In true Zen fashion, we learn that the secret to great writing is subtracting rules for writing, not adding them. It is not easy to teach us, or anyone else, to unlearn what we've worked so hard to acquire. But Natalie's Zen training comes to her aid and she shares her insights with us in this excellent book on writing."
4,Great for motivating a beginning writer!,"I am so thankful to the person who recommended ""Writing Down the Bones"" to me. It is my writing bible"
1,I might have liked this when I was a teenage hippie.,"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews of this book. There is little of substance that would help a serious student of writing. It is also terribly repetative. How many different ways can you say ""write all the time even if it is drivel?"" I stuggled to get through this book for three months, reading a couple of the small chapters at a time. Finally couldn't stand the boredom and lack of substance. I recommend ""Writing the Wave"" by Elizabeth Ayres instead for a stimulating, immediately engaging help for aspiring writers."
2,"May be helpful for you, but useless for me.","I turned to this book when I had the idea for my first novel, thinking it would help inspire my creativity and get my story from my brain to the page. Rather than offering practical advice, I found the book romanticized the process. At the time I read it, I was looking for a guide similar to Vicki King's How to Write a Movie in 21 Days (except for novel writing). I have yet to find that sort of a book, but I just completed the first draft of my novel mostly on the advice from Stephen King's On Writing, and a few select parts of Jack Bickham's work. If you actually want to get some work done, read the aforementioned books. If you would rather read about writing (or are looking for advice like, ""Try writing at a coffee shop""), then you might try this book."
1,indescribably bad,"This lady, herself, can't write a lick, and she tries to teach you to do the same. She comes off exactly like Deepak Chopra or one of those similar new-age hacks, putting together a series of meaningless, stream-of-consciousness psychobabble catchphrases and then marketing it as some kind of how-to book. There isn't one sentence of useful information in this thing. I say all this from the perspective of a person who has actually had things published, including a how-to book, in fact, and it strikes me that what is presented here is the sort of romantic fantasy about writing that people who have no chance of getting anything published like to delude themselves with, which explains its popularity. I guess that the most amazing thing is that every so often one of these clowns does somehow manage to get one of these vague, feelgood books in print that then sells a zillion copies to other, like-minded dreamers. Go figure."
4,Interesting and instructional,"In our writing group we have an editor. She spoke highly of the book to me. I was looking for more reading material at the time so I decided to try her recommendation. It truly was an enjoyable read.The mind is a subject that has always interested me. I am not to much on Zen or poetry but over many years I have learned to accept what I wish, not just what is written.Of many books I have read recently I am very glad my friend advised me of this one. I will surely keep it close to reference it at times. I will be happy to champion her writing to anyone that reqests any interesting book from me."
3,"Good content, way too small in size for the price","While I can say that I enjoy the book and the insight into the writing process, the size of the book was not made clear. It's pocket sized, to be sure - it's about 3""x4"", making it kind of hard to hold. I'm surprised anyone would even bother publishing a book that size, let alone charge as much as any other book for it.But, the content is wonderful and helpful to new writers."
2,Mixed feelings,The soft cloth is O.K. But it wasn't at all what I expected. I thought it would be better quality.
5,Best introduction ever,"I have often wanted to learn about our mystical tradition, but thought the kabbalah center's approach was too simplistic and was not based on Torah. Since it was originally a requirement that any student of our mystical tradition should be a scholar of Torah and Talmud, the center was not an appropriate place to start. Rabbi Kushner's book is an excellent way to begin the study of mysticism, which really originate in Torah itself."
4,Clear Touch for Sony Reader Touch Edition,"It does what it says on the tin.A word of advice, it is easy to apply, but apply it from the long edges, not the top or bottom edges as the size is so exact to the screen if it is not dead straight it goes on at an angle down the sides.It comes with a screen cleaning cloth and applicator which are useful, but a debit/credit card is slightly better equipped to remove any stubborn air bubbles!"
5,horrible!!!!!!,"this was a major mistake on my behalf.i love christmas time horror movies,but this incredibly horrible b-movie is not worth buying.infact i'm selling my copy."
4,Works - Fast but not fastest.,"Not sure how to review a memory card. I mean it meets its specs, presumably, and hasn't failed - what can I say? - I use it in my D300, which can generate picture data much faster than the Extreme III or Extreme IV can handle, so a high-speed burst of pictures (RAW mode) comes to a screeching halt after about 18 pictures with the Extreme III and takes several seconds before you can burst again. My understanding is that with the Extreme IV it will take 2-3 more pictures before coming to a halt, and recover from the halt faster. So, I don't regret buying the Extreme III, since it is considerably cheaper than the Extreme IV, but I suspect my next CF card purchase will be an Extreme IV - in a year or two after the price comes down. Dunno how it would compare to other manufacturer's versions of a similar card."
3,English dub is disappointing...,"Unfortunately, the usual magic of Miyazaki's works was somewhat ruined for me by the odd (and truthfully awful) English dub voice actor choices. The main girl affects a strange New Zealand/Australian/British/""who knows"" accent throughout the course of the film, and besides that is just a terribly unemotional voice actress. Besides her, there were several other voice actor choices that just didn't...fit. As much as I love Miyazaki's works, I was disappointed by the dub. I suggest watching this one in Japanese!!"
3,like steel panthers needs dosbox and the CD player,This game was an extention with battles from modern wars but there really wasn't any wars quite like WWII. It has a desert storm b attle were the american army is WAY better than the iraqis and it not much of a fight.
2,Yawn.,"This is one big yawn. It is what I call ""boat payment"" music: When an artist must need some extra cash and puts out drivel. Save your pennies and wait for his next (and hopefully more inspired)album."
2,Junkie what happened?,I loved Computer Hell Cabin...but this album was a big dissapointment. Only 2 good tracks? wow I didn't think it would be this bad. Better luck next time.
2,SO BORING!,"I bought this in the audiobook format and almost fell asleep at the wheel. I love all things Celtic and was excited to pick up a good piece of historical fiction since it got decent reviews. But instead of being a fun novel about druids, it was a long drawn out whine about an old man who was losing his faith and withering away.In her defense, the author does use good imagery and detail, and the descriptions of magic are convincingly authentic. But the book itself is way too dull.And for a quick criticism of the audiobook: I hate male narrators that use falsetto when they do female voices. It sounds absolutely ridiculous. I would definitely not recommend either format."
2,Chain tensioner,"What I didn't know when I ordered these was that all dropouts have different dimensions and these don't fit my bike, so double check before ordering."
4,He is not only a great drummer,"Omar always amazes us with his great gifts for music. Not many people know that he is also a awesome singer and writer since his drumming has made him so popular.And I understand that those who only know him as a drummer get disappointed at his solo CDs. But if you get rid of the idea that he is a drummer,you will find the other side of him in his music, which I have really been attracted to. When he sings , he gives us the same energy that he gives us from his drumming.I've been a fan of Omar's for more than twenty years and I still get great positive and happy vibe from his music. It would be nice if he can make so-called fusion album though. Omar keep it up and I'm looking forward to it!! Mayumi"
5,The Musician of the World,"Yeah, He is the best MUSICIAN in the world. Love is the biggest piece of his heart."
3,Omars second coming,"Personally I dont like this album as much as his previous solo effort. This could be because this diverse musicisian just tries to include too many styles in the album and so doesnt quite know where its going. I enjoyed the more pop/funk songs the most which were more evident in his last album. These incude the fun title track which has a really cool beat to it including a nice break in it with just the bass drum, track 5 which is his best 'slower' song on the album, and track 9 mainly because of some amazing drums towards the end. The last couple of tracks are also enjoyable and some have him on the new Roland V drum electric kit which is interesting to hear(sounds just like a real kit). So over all a good listen if you are a fan of Omar or like drums but otherwise not the best."
3,Caution: Kindle Version Does Not Have Footnotes,The Kindle version of the Folger Shakespeare Plays has only the basic play itself without footnotes or other helpful information.
2,A Good Book for Beginers,"Recently I read four of the books currently available for Photoshop CS . This book was one of them and it was the weakest in terms of both the style of writing and content.\\The author points out that he wrote the book ""because not one other book he reviewed covered digital noise"". I do have to give him some credit here because digital noise is not addressed in most of the other books. The problem is this is the only issue that I found to be unique to this book.Overall, I guess in an attempt to lighten up the subject you are subjected to endless silly little joking followed by very simplistic techniques for handling various digital imaging problems.This book my actually be fine for a beginner or someone that does not want to really understand the subject. For me it was a dissapointment."
5,Excellent Book - Shows Better ways for Important Tasks,"I've been using photoshop for 4 years or so - and I thought I was doing ok with image sharpening, correcting exposure, etc. This book however quickly illustrates better techniques for sharpening, exposure, enlarging and dodging an burning. The techniques are simply explained - with some humor mixed throughout.This is a fantastic Photoshop book."
4,Good Book,I got this b/c I am still pretty new to photoshop and it's a tough program to get a handle on b/c of the terminology. This booked helped me get thru the basics and even had a few advanced tips. It's easy to read and very well written (Kelby is pretty funny!) I would reccomend this to anyone just starting out in photoshop.
3,Don't Judge an Album by Its Title,"In the case of Jaguar Wright, more of the same is a good thing. Noteworthy are the remake of ""Woman to Woman"" (previously covered by R&B singer Jewell) and the nearly 12-minute ""Do Your Worst""."
3,Not as good as the first album,"Jaguar Wright is an artist no doubt. She can hold a note no doubt. She can write a decent song no doubt. But, to me her voice and the way she twists words are borderline crazy. For her to be as cocky as she is, this set is half prereleased tracks from a previous album that didn't get put out and half hearted new material. The first single avergae, her rendition of Woman to Woman, unnecessary and uninspired. The album had a shinning moment in My Place, but other than that I had difficulty listening all the way through. I think the sophomore jinx has hit Ms. Wright."
1,a Broke Mary J.Bliege,"take away the song called ""song Cry"" by Jay z on his Overrated Unplugged album on MTV&nobody would bother listening to Jaguar wright. all She does is scream&Hollers on Her Songs.the Production&the songs are corny.She can't sing at all.she sounds like she was standing in front of her Mirror emulating Mary J.Bliege from 92-94 but somehow couldn't get it quite right.this album just as her last Album reflect she is a Bargin Basement on Clearence version of Mary J.Bliege."
4,"Solid watch, works well so far","This watch works and looks great. It's not as huge a face as some watches are these days, so it looks more normal on my skinny wrist. I've only had it about a month so I can't attest to the ""10-year battery"" but everything seems good so far. My only small complaint is that the links in the band are pretty big, so it's hard to get a really perfect fit, unless you are just lucky. Mine is either too tight or too loose if I change one link. But it's still comfortable enough. It has way more functions than I need, but I guess that's fine. It would be nice if the clock hands automatically set themselves to match the digital time (which is much easier to set), but oh well. Still a solid watch."
3,A Great Watch,"I like to buy watches for gifts,they are a great gift.This watch,is great,easy to read,keeps great time.No complaints from anyone that I bought themfor presents.They love this watch!"
2,died after 2 months,"Inexpensive, not particularly attractive, and lasted only two months. I paid $5.65 to ship it for warranty repair a week ago. Will I ever see it again? Who knows... Guess I'll get a Timex."
2,It fell apart.,"I liked this watch very much, but after two weeks the resin case fell apart and it came off my arm."
2,"Nice looking but after dark, forget it!","I wanted a cheap wristwatch that kept time in 2 time zones, was replacing one [a Casio] that had lasted about 8 yrs. This one cost about $20, looks nice, keeps time in 2 zones: 1 by analog hands, the other in the digital screen at the bottom, just like before. But the analog hands are not set by a twist screw as before; you push a button to change it, then hold another one down till the hands reposition.But the hands only move clockwise. So when i need to reset them for an earlier time zone, I have to go all the way around 23 hours to get there.THEN - when it's dark and you want to know what time it is, you push a button to turn on a backlite. BUT - it's glary and the hands are the same color as the face so you can't see the hands anyway. And no way can you read the digital face in the dark with the lite on.REally dumb. Very surprised at Casio. A very thoughtless product. 2 stars, that's all."
3,"One Star, Two Stars, Three Stars Go!","The watch out of the box is nice. The instructions for setting the watch are written in ""get your magnifying glass"" font. I'm fairly computer literate but admit the watch instructions defeated me. The watch was also difficult to view under less than ideal lighting conditions. Three stars because it's a nice band, nice idea for two time zones and all the other features. I'm sure some will find it a good watch so it would be unfair to give it 1 star which is the rating I give it from MY viewpoint. To add to being objective, I'm in the 'Senior' range of years."
3,Watch out for the band adjustment,"I was quite pleased with the watch as received. However, the band was too large for my wrist. There were no instructions for adjusting the band included in the shipment.. I therefore contacted Casio for adjustment procedures and subsequently received them.. I'm pretty handy with tools but I can say that 98 percent of those buying this watch would not be able to make the adjustment. If given to a watch repair shop the cost to perform the band adjustment would surely cost more than the watch purchase."
2,The photo make this look better then it is,"If you have ever traveled to New York City and stopped by one of those street side venders, this watch is about the same quality. Save your money."
1,Revisionist history,"Absolute rubbish.A truly fictitious attempt to discredit actual science-based examination of the phony evidence for war.Start with the fact that the anthrax was U.S. military grade, straight from a U.S. lab, and that as soon as that came out the ""investigation"" into the source of those mailings was summarily shut down, and go from there.This book is just another cover-up for neocon believers... people who will apparently believe anything, even if they are intelligent."
4,"Wonderful story, irritating voice","I love the story of the BFG and think Natasha Richardson really does do a great job at narration on the whole (Roald Dahl is a really hard author to read aloud). But the voice she chose to use for the BFG is so incredibly annoying, I would never put it on again. We listened to this in the car with the kids (ages 10, 6, & 4) for several hours and it took a great deal of willpower not to turn it off at some points. The kids loved it and didn't mind the voice in the least -- but my husband and I wanted ear plugs."
4,Dahl is edgy but fun.,"Sure those other giants are frightening, but so is life. Sophie is brave and the BFG is enchanting. His marvelous vernacular will have you renaming all kinds of things. Right or left?"
3,I loved this book!,i loved this book! It is exciting and funny. the BFG is a giant (a big friendly giant)! one day he goes to a town at the witching hour and looks in Sophies window sophie is scared and looks at him.sophie is taken from her bed at the orphanage the bfg and her become friends and have many edventuers together and fight off the MEG (man eating giants). i relly hope you enjoy this book!
5,A Wonderful World,This book was one of Roald Dahl's best books ever.It is about a little girl named Sophie that saw a giant and was taken from her orphanege. The person that took her said he is the Big Frendly Giant. This story would probaly be for 2nd grade and up. I liked this book because the BFG talks funny. I also like this book because Roald Dahl explains what his storys are about.
5,The Story of the BFG,"This was a very interesting book. I liked the idea of the BFG blowing dreams into children's windows, which made the children have nice dreams. The BFG gave the dreams odd names like Golden Phizzwizard. I think children should read this book because the author tells the story using vocabulary in a funny way. For example, he calls helicopters bellyhoppers. This book will keep you interested in finding out how the army and airforce will find and catch the giants. The giants must be found to stop them from guzzling humans. Read this book to see if they get caught. I wonder if you will wish that they get caught like I did when I read the book."
1,Am I the only one?,"I have tried, really I have, to like Road Dahl and what is referred to ""classic literature,"" I have read the BFG and James and the Giant Peach with my kids. But I found myself editing as I went and I did not like all the dark underlying content. These are books for children, right? James' parents being killed by a rhino and then the awful cruelty of his aunts, and in the BFG the giants and their horrid names that eat children... am I the only one who sees a problem here?? No more for us. I really do not understand why these books are rated well. I really do not understand why they read the BFG in my son's second grade class either. These books are NOT for young kids and are depressing."
3,Another useful piano book added to the collection!,"This piano book is not used as much as others in our house, but it is handy for teaching my son to read music."
5,Good beginner book,"I'm teaching my daughter and myself to play at the same time and this book has been very helpful. It won't teach you everything, and you'll have to supplement with online or other materials, but it's definitely good to add to your library."
2,I was embarassed for the characters.,"Have you ever read a book and cringed when something happens to embarass one of the characters? That is the way I felt throughout this book. There wasn't any real chemistry between Anne and Connor and Anne was at times incredibly weak and pathetic in her attempts to get Connor to reestablish a relationship. Connor clearly did not deserve her and Anne was not as strong as the author tried to make us believe. Anne and Connor hardly spent enough time together to learn about how each other had changed and even then, they clearly weren't ready for any kind of committment. There were also several characters the book could have done without and at least 3 subplots that just sort of died without being resolved.I was not impressed by If the Slipper Fits. I sincerely don't think the slipper fit at all."
3,Wonderful ideas poorly presented,"The ideas presented in this book were wonderful, but problems with mechanics and style interfered so much that I almost quit reading it. I cannot imagine a publisher letting something this poorly written get by. One problem was the author's constant ""gushiness"" and ending even ordinary statements in exclamation marks. Enough already! Also, run-on sentences and other grammatical errors abound. There are also some problems with clarity. At one point, the author (mistakenly, I believe) indicates that she was 15 when she was in the sixth grade."
1,More politics.,"The book is not bad if you can get over the liberal agenda. What would be expected from Mike Wallace? I hate to admit this, I would like to have seen historical pictures of the CMH and its recipients."
4,Was almost as good as expected.,"I read this book when it was first released two years ago. Of the 3,000 + Medal of Honor recipients, the authors did have to cut it down to about two for each war. It is a very informative book. I have read it several times over. I am surprised that only one woman was a recipient though. I figured there would be more. And, just one Coast Guard officer recieved this Medal. It is very informative, but to those who want more out of it, such as the entire biographies of all recipients, that book would be about 8,000 pages. There are some recipients who recieved the Medal of Honor two times. Do they get a second biography?"
1,Doesn't work...,This charger worked for the first week... then nothing. It seems that the connectors are poorly made. Don't waste your money.
4,wonderful product,"I recently moved to NJ area from NY and I was in urgent need of a GPS. You know how crazy drivers are in NJ, and I bought this GPS after reading many reviews about it and also about other similar modelss. The biggest features I liked in this model is that it speaks street names and bluetooth phone.There are still some glitches in the mapping software as it does not recognize the weired left tern system on RT-1 in new jersey where you can not make left ,instead you have to go forward and then make right and go round and come back (those who live in NJ knows very well what I mean). I hope this will be fixed in new mapping updates in 2009.I just don't understand why garmin would not give free update of maps every year instead of making you purchase. thats the only downsite of it and that is the reason I gave 4 star"
3,Somewhat Confusing,"We purchased this item for our daughter. She loves the unit and it works exceptionally well. The main dissatisfaction we have is navigating the menus. Trying to mark your current position as a favorite is rather convoluted. It would be better if there was a ""click here to add current location to favorites"" feature. Since we have not had the device for long...maybe there is and we just haven't found it. Other than that, once the locations are listed for favorites - the device is great and she is much more confident in her traveling."
4,Garmin c580,Ilove my c550 so I bought the c580 as a second vehicle GPS. I really like the 580 too. The only thing I would change is to show the traffic on the navigation sceen rather than having to go to the MSNdirect screen.
5,Best GPS of all,Love this GPS. Think it is to much better than the others. This is the second one I've gotten - one is a Christmas gift. BUY IT! Worth every penny! The price is right!
4,GPS,"The product works great with the information is programed in. However,the local streets and establishments need to be updated. It appears much of the local data is 3-5 years behind. It needs the ability to pinpoint a current location and save it. Overall it performs like I wanted it to."
3,Pretty good product,"I have had this item for about 2 months now. MSN direct is limited and not available in all areas, so if you are buying this because of theat service check availability or get the c550 i guess is the one that is identical but w/o the MSN.The GPS has been great even directing to shortcuts on class 6 dirt roads( I live in NH). All ijn all pleased the POI stores/ restaurants are inaccurate often, but when they are right having the availability of the phone number right on the screen and being able to cll by pressing the screen is an excellent feature.. can make reservations on the way to restaurant if needed.. very pleased so far. started having power issues today may be my connection to the car power plug, will chsck it out tomorrow."
4,I Love this piece,"Execellent GPS. I really like the guided voice for directions.I have been using this GPS for the last 3 months and I love it.The best part is once I got my new Nokia 5300 Xpres Mobile Phone.It took me less than 2 minutes to create the connectivity between these 2 devices. The Bluetooth works very fine and I really enjoy to talk to my friends, while driving using bluetooth in my GPS.I recommend this product strongly."
1,hardly worth your time > . . .,"The editorial review says it all:Conspiracy theorists and Civil War buffs may want to take a gander, but overall this book adds little to our understanding of the assassination."
3,pretty sorry book,"when i picked this book up, i wanted a funny novel maybe a little romance but not a stupid murder whodunit mystery....if you are looking for a book along the lines of 'good in bed' or 'summer sisters' this sure ain't it!"
2,Very uneven,"Picking this book up for its feeble connections to the world of chick lit and its more worthy successors, I was disappointed by this slight contribution to the genre. The characters are broadly drawn, almost caricatures, and the plot switches so abruptly from romance to murder mystery to thriller as to leave the reader behind.Don't bother."
3,Not as bad as it sounds!!!,I found this to be pretty much worth reading.It was an interesting book with okay characters & an alright plot that had mystery & hilarity both.I would'nt recommend it if you're looking for a really good read due to it being a bit cheesy & unrealistic yet sometimes we just need to read a book like that.But I think Smart vs. Pretty was alright for light reading but it won't ever become a classic--I can guarantee that!!!!
4,Relating to Reading,If you are a sister you will love this book. You will love this book becasue two sisters Amanda and Frank share there thoughts and feelings throughout the book. They go through the struggle of keeping there family coffee shop running. This book has mystery and comedy all in one! So if you get a chance to read it pick it up and read away.
5,sisterly love,"finally, a book that addresses sibling rivalry with a sense of humor, and not soapy, sudsy tearjerking melodrama."
1,Dull & Predictable,"I found this book about as interesting as a made-for-tv movie starring Jaclyn Smith. Dull, Dull, Dull. I had read the other amazon reader reviews, and felt confident in choosing this as a title for my book club. What a mistake. I was half-way in the book when I had serious doubts about my choice. At three-quarters, I was telling book club members to hold off on buying the book. I barely finished reading it, that's how predictable it was. By the end, I had to call all the book club members and issue a revised choice for our June book.This book was interesting at first, but then it became too convoluted. There were attempts at interesting conflict, which in the end, weren't interesting at all. It would make a nice premise for a sitcom, but it's not a good book. Not at all. Don't waste your time."
5,it kept me up all night!,"This is a high octane, caffiene-overdose exciting page turner! It really speaks to our generation. I loved the developing relationship between the sisters. They were very 'alive' and reminded me of my family."
1,Glad I got it for nothing.,"A friend gave me this book when she moved, and I can see why she parted with it so easily. This book took me forever to read; I only finished it because I hate to give up on any book (although I wish I had with this one, life is too short).The story isn't all that interesting. The writing was not to my liking, and the dialogue was pretty terrible.I recognized Valerie Frankel's name when I got the book, but don't let that sway you. Dreck is dreck."
2,Disappointing,"This book was really cute but an overall disappointment. The plot was back and forth, being both very simple but all over the place at the same time; there was too much ""drama"" crammed in there that it made it a really difficult book to get into. Very simple, very sappy."
2,Try Sulky vs. Flaky,"If you are interested in a book about the differences of two sisters and how they learn and grow from them, don't look here. While creating over-defined characters the author forgets about two things: an interesting storyline and realistic characters.As far as the sisters are concerned, it is easy to tell them apart. But ""Smart"" seemed more like a sulky pessimist and ""Pretty""... a flaky daydreamer. With the addition of misplaced supporting characters and an awkward 'who-done-it?' subplot, this book will always be better unopened."
3,Recommended... but not the best,"I think that this book was funny in a generic way. I had just completed Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella and thought that this book would follow the same brand of dry humor. I was wrong. This book lacked the structure that would probably put it up there with Bridget Jones' Diary (Which I have not yet read.) and the sequel. I think that if you want a mindless read for a plane ride or such, this book would be great. But if you are looking for a book to make you think, look elsewhere!"
5,Solid,This six piece set of Mini Torx screwdrivers are made solid and the grips are excellent. The kit also includes a decent carry case so as to keep them all together. Can not go wrong for the money on this set.
2,I received a used book in poor condition.,"I am fine with the content, my problem is with the condition the book was in when it was shipped to me. I received a used library book in poor condition, many of the pop up figures are bent and do not open well. Also I don't know how many different hands have touched this book so I didn't even bother letting my son have the book. If they are selling a used book in less than perfect condition it should be clearly stated in the description."
5,Tea Drop,"Have one in the home and one in the Motorhome, and one for backup. Used every day atleast once per day. Best electric tea maker on the market."
3,It is quite strong,I actually bought it and then learned that 100 mg is too much for females. After consulting with books I've found that the maximum daily dosage for women should be 25 mg! It is better to ask a health care provider before using. I've got to tell: it does increase your energy a lot...a powerful hormone and perhaps there will be more studies on it for the future!!
1,poor,"well, it didn't work for me, tried on hard plastic parts of interior of my suv,scratches still there ,any recomentation?"
3,Helpful,This book is an easy read. A lot of helpful information. Written so that is easy to understand. I would recommend it to anyone that has the Fibromyalgia syndrome.
4,Its alright.,Didnt know i could paint vinyl until I saw a video using this spray. Its alright but make sure you give it enough to dry cause it starting flaking.
2,Not so good,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just isn't that good. Some of the dialogue was very good and funny, especially the banter between the best friends. But overall, the movie had a sad and depressing look and feel to it. Hopefully, this isn't the way most LA twentysomethings live their lives.Also, I didn't feel that anything was resolved by the end of the film: it just stopped. No happy ending here.If you're into low budget and depressing movies, this one is for you. If you're looking for an entertaining, feel good, romantic comedy, this is definitely not for you."
2,Not good at all,"Well, I just stopped watching this film, or shall I say a part of it. It was 34 minute of it and I couldn't go any further.To watch it till the end, you will have to take prozac or sth. The acting is not so bad bad bad, but the action is nothing.Definitely a piece for the fans of alternative stuff."
3,Total Ambivalence -,"Personally, a major disappointment.Acting is suboptimal.Too many holes in this storyline."
3,"Terry, Tyrell, and Jeff","All three men have something in common: they will not-can not-be faithful to their women. That is until they learn that every dog must have their day.When they realize this, their hearts grow warm toward the women they love, but it's still that doubt of ""will they cheat again"".Love's Game really teaches women that the everyday reality of cheating does exist. It reads as an eye opener to women, and at the same time shows them that somewhere in a man's doggish ways lies sincerity and regret. For the ladies that have been traumatized by a man's cheating ways, however, I WOULD NOT recommend this book. It really has you on edge at times.RolandaNothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"
3,misleading mp3 support,"The owners manual informs you that CD-RW's are not recommendable and sure enough it did not recognize a RW disc recorded with mp3's or one recorded in a regular audio format (non mp3). I will say that the DVD funtion is outstanding, as is the audio quality from pre-recorded factory CD's and CD'R's. Unfortunately the CD-RW non-support is a major factor for me, and all e-tailers who sell this product have not relayed the CD-RW information. If this is not an issue for you, then by all means buy this player."
3,Alternative to PJs,"What I envisioned in my mind when I purchased this item was to use it underneath summer dresses to prevent summer rash. When I opened and see how it looked like, I realized it would not work for my intended purpose. Instead ofreturning, I opted to use it as alternative to pajamas during the summer. Thus, my 3 star ratings."
1,Someone has a chip on her shoulder,"The author is definitely biased. As a physician and an economist I certainly don't sympathize with the drug companies but the author appears to have a chip on her shoulder. She spits out factoiods and then uses poor logic without any analytical basis to derive conclusions.There normally exists two kinds of economics, normative economics and positive economics. This book is an example of a 3rd type of economics called unrealistic economics.It is so bad I returned it because I felt robbed."
3,Over the top,"I found this book to be interesting, but at the same time the redundancy became distracting. The voice Dr. Angell writes with seems a bit immature for this level of work, and the book is littered with personal opinions that are only partially backed up by fact. She frequently goes over the same material, constantly takes the same position, and doesn't go as in depth as she could into the issues. The book only skirts the problem and she writes what any person could figure out if they did some reasearch into policy and PhRMA."
3,Quite thin,"These gauze pads are only half the thickness of the J&J ones labeled as Hospital Grade Gauze Pads. I needed to use 2 for each dressing change. They are okay if you have a non draining wound and just need a cover to keep it clean. If the wound is wet or needs a moist ointment, I recommend getting the other type. I purchased them thinking I was getting so much more for the money than the hospital grade gauze pads. These come packaged 2 to a pouch, so I assume you are expected to use 2 of them at a time. If you have to use 2, they are more costly than the others. If I need large bandages in future, I will stick with the hospital grade gauze pads."
1,Not enough information on put trades,The book goes into selling puts and buying index puts as insurance. No where does it say how many months out to buy the puts or sell the puts. Very confusing. Also the formula given for number of index puts is unrealistic. Cannot recommend
2,Disapointed,"These really are not ghost stories. This is a compilation of the old TV program. I ordered two DVD's, two different series of Ghost Stories and have not even opened the second. Some may enjoy this but if you are looking for the paranormal you will not find it here."
5,Awesome!,"This was an awesome set of shows! I wasn't expecting it to be a tv series, but it was very good anyway!"
1,Disgusting,"This stuff tastes like glue. There is no hint of marshmallow flavor in it at all. I am a person who never eats packaged or processed foods so my taste buds are different from when I was eating packaged things regularly in the past, now I can actually taste individual ingredients in foods like salt, pepper, spices. So, to me, this tasted like licking the bottom of a shoe or eating glue. Full of chemicals, no food taste to it at all. Now a year ago when I regularly ate processed foods my taste buds probably would have found this to not be so nasty..."
1,Disgusting,"Only resembles Marshmallow cream / fluff slightly in appearance.Tastes gross. Almost flavored like sugar free pancake syrup, but disgusting."
5,A Fascinating Book,"Sacred Games is a wonderful journey through India through the eyes of two thoroughly human and memorable characters: one perhaps 'good' and the other not. Aside from learning more about the rich human landscape of this huge and diverse country, the book also brought home to me that we first world inhabitants who are so steeped in the luxury of natural resources (like water) do not recognize it and keep thinking we need more. The book brings you down to earth.Chandra's characters, large and small, are familiar and you don't want their stories to end."
1,Slow and scattered,"I am so disappointed in this book, I thought it would be really fast paced and exciting. I am about one third of the way into it and can hardly bring myself to continue. It is so slow and there seems to be way too much useless information that the author offers and I find myself thinking: ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on get on with it and just tell a story!"" I don't think I can continue reading, it is just to slow pokey for my taste."
4,Battles in the North...,"Quorthon has dominated Scndinavian black metal for more than a decade, even though he has publicly admitted that his music is most of the time low quality. After the ""Twilight of the Gods"" I did not expect to see another epic album from Bathory, but the man behind them surprised me with the release of this material, which is well out of the black metal norms he has gotten us used to. Epic metal ladies and gentlemen (maybe only gentlemen.) The recording is awful (I thought I heard an aircraft pass by during a song) but the music is something else. Think of this album as something that a friend of yours recorded at the basement of his house. The rest is left to the melodies from the northern provinces..."
4,Get dis CD or T gonna come to your house!,"Betta listen up foo! Mr. T gives this CD to all little childrens at the orphan home. Dats right, sucka. Them childrens really love to dance to da Hampton's singles. You betta get this CD for yo own children, foo! Otherwise Mr. T gonna have to come visit you in person."
4,Great Gift,"Great christmas gift. Couldn't be found on the stores so I ordered it on Amazon, fast service."
2,No benefits noticed,"Took one capsule every day until the bottle ran out and never noticed any improvement in my urinary flow. Don't really want to take drugs, so I'm checking other alternatives. Bottom line, didn't do anything for me, good or bad."
4,Useful Carrier,"Got this to bring along some favorite wine on a weekend getaway. Provided portability and protection for two bottles. The accessories were a bit lacking, I replaced the plastic wine glasses with two similarly sized glasses of my own - wine in plastic seems wrong. I used a cloth dinner napkin to provide some extra padding and protection for the glasses. Like another reviewer, I also brought along my own sturdier bottle opener - the one included did seem a bit flimsy and also seemed like it would be uncomfortable to use. These aren't major issues, the main thing I wanted was the tote and I'm happy with it's performance."
4,Biker Boyz,"This is an older film that I like. I'm a sucker for movies on bike or car culture. Anything with race or chase scenes. Good cast, descent script and it's filmed well. Good story about how difficult relationships are and the passing of the torch to the next generation."
4,A finely woven web,"An Uncertain Currency is one of the delightful ""finds;"" a book that catches your eye and you know in a glance that you'll enjoy it. I enjoyed Mario's story interwoven with the goings on in Floraville. It provided background and counterpoint. My only complaint is that there is a little too much going on to keep track of. I found myself frequently having to go back to try to find a previous mention of a character to figure out who was going what. I find it interesting that other reviewers have pictured Mario as Don Ameche or Cesar Romero. Even though he's Italian, I couldn't help pictuing him as David Suchet's portrayal of Hercule Poirot."
4,Makes easy work of reading,"I own this 2-CD set (bought them at Barnes & Nobles).It does indeed show you how to improve your ability to read faster and grasp a lot of what you read.As an author, speaker and consultant I read a lot of material and while audio-books are OK there are some things that don't come in audio format. So for me, learning how to read smarter was just what I needed and this delivered.Good luck"
5,Ipod Adapter,"Fantastic Product...best price (having thoroughly shopped it around) AND!!!! Fantastic support!!!! I had some initial trouble with engine noise....responded IMMEDIATELY and made suggestions (which, of course, worked)Whoot!"
3,Interesting,"I think the best possible review of this book is the book itself, after all, the implicit authorial (or narratorial) intent is the de-mystification of self-referentialism. That said, on a rather banal level I did find the book useful in plotting a journey from Walthamstow to Barnes. It's as vibrant an example of the genre as I have seen for a while, written with genuine verve, though the thematic crux of the darkness of the modern mind presented from the vantage point of one geographical location has, perhaps, one inherent strain too many."
4,Another Good Work on the American Revolution,"While not in the same class as Higganbotham's War of American Independence, Mackesy's The War for America, or even Middlekauff's The Glorious Cause, Griffith's work is still a good read regarding the Revolutionary War. As others have mentioned, Griffith admirably depicts the events, figures, and context of both sides. However, many of Griffith's points can be better found in other sources, so my advice would be to read those works (such as the ones mentioned above) before turning to Griffith."
3,Verbose,"Boring, I just could not get into this book. Out of all the Revolutionary books I have read this one was my least favorite."
5,Good,This is an old book but full of the information any tatter would need....a definate buy for the tatter of today
1,Lacks credibility,"There is plenty of hypocrisy in the world, in politics, and in both parties. While an author has the right to focus on one specific group, as Schweizer does, in this case his justification for doing so (that when liberals misbehave, they harm their principles, but when conservatives do the same ""they harm only themselves and their families"") is so absurd it makes it hard to take the rest of the book seriously.Try telling the families of each one of the 2,000-plus American soldiers who have died in Iraq that no one but Republicans and their families got hurt by a war based on a lie."
4,Falsehoods? Truths? Half-Truths?,"Since this book was released, I have not read or heard where there is a threat of lawsuit for libel...so everything must be factual. This will make a great gift for my friends on both sides of the aisle!"
2,"you're a hypocrite, therefor i'm right","Lets see, reviewer cpps validates this book because it shows the liberals portrayed being just as greedy and corrupt within the system as the Republican proponents of that system. But aren't the Republicans still worse because they are the ones who support it? Pointing out people's hypocrisy is all good and well, but it doesn't prove anything in itself, and it certainly doesn't prove the opposite of the hypocrites' proclaimed views. Or maybe it does... hmmm... Maybe the crackhead who tells you how bad crack is and keeps smoking it is really proving what a good thing it is with his hypocrisy. let's legalize crack!"
1,What a waste of time.,"Biased and shallow literature.....not worth reading it.Let me see...how many republicans in public office, as of today, are under investigation for bribery, corruption and abuse of power?"
4,Liberals- BEWARE!,"Hard hitting and well-documented.If you are a liberal, you better have a thick skin!"
4,No wonder liberals hate facts.,"Too funny. What a group of clowns we have on the left. Of course some of the actions brought to light in this book would actually be good ol' American business if the perpetrators weren't out proselytizing against other folks engaged in shrewd land deals, lucrative speaking engagements, and successful investing. It's a very readable book that will engage and enrage the reader at the same time."
5,You do it I do not have to....,Millionaire in 365 Days: The Daily Plan to Get ThereDid we not always know that as we get preached to by the liberals....they never do what they want the rest of us to do....names are revealed as well as their dirty secrets.....did you know that Michael Moore owns stock of health care companies and auto companies ?????Interesting and revealing...find out what they really do...in secret.
1,For the True Believer Only,"For those who already have thier minds made up and will look no further, this book is for you. For those that think that FOX News is not Biased then this book is for you. For those that like thier facts to fit thier conservative ideology this book is for you.For the rest of us that like to check the facts, that compare the hypocrisy of liberals and conservatives, and that want something other than propaganda... look elsewere."
1,"The book, itself, is hypocrisy.","Pres. Bush has to be the biggest living hypocrite today. Says we must fight to bring democracy and rights to Iraq, meanwhile he is robbing Americans of their civil liberties with illegal wiretaps. Both he & Cheney yell ""support the troops"" yet they send them into battle with no armor. meanwhile their buddies make away with millions. Remember do as THEY say, not as they do."
2,Hypocrits R Us,"I'm sure most people are guilty of hypocrisy from time to time. But writing a book about liberal hypocrisy to discredit a political philosphy is just plain silly.But I'm giving the book 2 stars because it is somewhat funny to read.To counter its silly point of view I am offering my own.Why do some conservatives support war and yet when it was there time to serve, dodged the draft?Dick Cheney and his five student deferments.Rush Limbaugh and the small butt pimple (which could have been surgically removed) that gave him a medical deferment. And let's include Limbaugh's outspoken anti-drugs sermons while at the same time he was an addict."
1,How VERY Sad.,"This book and those like it greatly sadden me, and make me seriously worry about the future of this country.Why is it that people take such pleasure in trashing and attempting to destroy others, just to make themselves feel somehow superior? The truth is incidental to them, and is only useful if it promotes their biased, self-serving agenda.Extremely sad, and very telling about where the TRUE hypocrisy lies.This book is for you if you like keeping company with the bottom-feeders of our society ..."
1,Typical right-wing subterfuge...,Don't waste your time on this dribble. It's not even slightly accurate and lacks any hint of wit.
1,"If you are gullible, buy this book and others like it","Michael Moore, Peter Schweizer, they are no different. If you want to make a lot of money, write a book that rips on one of the two political parties. The other party soaks it up and the person gets rich. You are a bunch of suckers if you pay for any of these types of books!I think we'd be kidding ourselves to think both sides have not been extreamly hypocritical. Spend time growing yourself and not on books like this."
5,Hypocrisy on both sides...,"Several reviews mention the author's lack of condemnation for conservative hypocrisy. It sounds like they haven't read the book.Mr. Schweizer explains that when prominent conservatives (Rush Limbaugh, William Bennett, Dr. Laura) have been exposed for hypocrisy, they took responsibility and acknowledged their shortcomings and failures. Liberals don't seem to be willing to do the same.Why? Because the conservatives admitted ""that by contradicting their own principles they had damaged their lives and reputations. They were not better off for having done what they did. But for liberals, the case is quite the opposite. When liberals abandon their principles and engage in hypocrisy, they often improve their lives. What does that tell us about which ideas are superior?"" (quote from pages 12 and 13.)"
2,"Initial shipment was disappointing, but Amazon replaced with another good set",The 1st 2 shipments that i received for the LOTR - The 2 Towers was disappointing. Both sets looked used and in a terrible condition with tears and worn-out marks on the boxes and celophane plastic.But Amazon replaced one of the set FOC when i wrote in to submit feedback.So Kudos to Amazonnizam
4,Good but would have been better with subtitles,Amazon do something please to have subtiles in movies. Over all the movie was good .. Streaming was good and the quality of movie was nice. Some places i realky wanted subtiles so it would nice to watch those scene with subtitles
4,"Its such a good movie, even though I liked part one better","I thought the The Fellowship was a better movie overall, but even so, I can't help but watch this Two Towers repeatedly just because it's so well done."
5,Great movie the series is great,The lord of the rings series is a great movie series from peter jackson for themovie is told just like in the three part books.Plus its filmed in 2.35:1 ratio the standerd for movies
5,Making history,The very concept of an extended edition is awesome. Peter Jackson has set a new standard for future DVDs. The Two Towers Extended edition is much better that The Fellowship. It is by far the best DVD I have ever seen. It fills all the missing points of the theatrical version. Buy it and enjoy it!
2,I'm all alone,"Anyone who has read the book will be likely to find this film to be jarring. If Peter Jackson is such a Tolkien fan, why does he find it necessary to make so many gratuitous changes? My personal unfavorite is the new character Faramir who Jackson wrote in. By a strange coincidence, Tolkien also had a character by the same name in his book. I am not a purist,and loved the Fellowship despite its changes, but this time the spirit of the book has been trampled and I really don't care if I am the only person in the known universe who thinks so."
3,soooo...... longggg....,"I can understand how people whould LOVE this movie, but it was just to long for me. Full of trolls and elves and faries... U know the fairy Im talking about ;) LOL"
2,The trailer was deceptive. The movie has major story errors.,"The Two Towers had fantastic cinematography and effects, just like the first; however, it seriously deviates from the book. Now I know that a movie can't follow any book exactly and I was impressed with how 'The Fellowship of the Rings' was amazingly close to the book. But the Two Towers takes some of the most key events, characters, and relationships and totally changes them around. The first movie did not.Great action... I think parts would be hard to follow for someone who hasn't read the books. There were some serious director liberties taken in this movie... many, many more than the previous. Some major events resembled the book. Others were totally changed and made less effective. Readers of the books who liked the first movie will be seriously disappointed with this movie. Too bad. :(."
3,All your favorite characters and a WHOLE NEW ADVENTURE!,"This movie is the movie that lost my faith in the series of movies that ... money through the straw that is The Lord of The Rings. Aragorn does not fall off of a cliff, so why bother thirty minutes of a potentially good film depicting it. Faramir was absolutely horrible. He did not EVER take Frodo and Sam to Gondor, and he had the exact opposite personality than he had in the book. He was supposed to be the honorable one while Boromir was a power-hungry slob. Faramir acts like Boromir reincarnated. Why would anyone go through the trouble of ruining the best book in the series?"
5,ANOTHER HOMERUN!,"After my great experience with ""The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)"", I didn't hesitate a minute with the extended release of the two towers. Great stuff!Again, I wonder why they just didn't show this version in the theaters? Not really that much longer than the original and much more entertaining and clear. Closer to the book in a variety of ways and for you Gollum lovers there's a lot more of the slimy little creature with all of his enduring qualities.The four-disc set is also packed with extra features up the ying-yang. And don't viewing everything until you've found the hidden extra feature hosted by Peter Jackson himself. That's all I'm saying.A must for every serious LOTR fan.Douglas McAllister"
4,one ring to rule them all .,second story of lord of the rings. its real intersting story about good and evil. its about medievl times. like harry potter.
5,This was a gift,Great buy! This was a gift and they loved it. It came in a perfect condition. I love not having to leave my house to shop and have things arrive in great condition! This is the way to purchase just about anything!
4,Lack of editing,I would have given this movie 5 stars IF this movie hadn't been soooo long. I've seen movies that were lengthy because the character development and plot warranted the length. I felt like there was just too much time spent on the battle scenes and the talking trees! The visual effects were stunning and the scenery was breathtaking. I just didn't see why this movie couldn't have been edited more efficiently so as to make it more enjoyable.
5,EXCELLENT!,"As in the case of the Fellowiship of the Ring, the Two Towers is equally, if not more, AMAZING! A sure must for all! Well done Peter Jackson!"
1,Amazing -- a worse film than Fellowship of the Ring,"Upon seeing Peter Jackson's Fellowship of the Ring, I thought it would be impossible to do a worse job capturing the story and character of Tolkien's work.I was wrong.This film expands on Jackson's horror-movie sensibility, using the bones of Tolkien's plot as an excuse to smear the screen with blood and over-the-top visual effects.A pox upon thee, Peter Jackson. If I could give this film zero stars, I would."
2,disappointed,"Having read the books a couple of times, i feel i know the story pretty well. Now the first movie strayed a little from the book, and it was ok. The two towers on the other hand........ I have to wonder if peter jackson even had a copy of the second book. This movie did everything but follow the storyline of the book. Don't get me wrong the graphics and action and all that were outstanding, but why even make a movie after a book if you arent going to follow the book, at least a little. I for one am disappointed, and doubt that I'll visit the theatre to see it as many times as the first."
2,CAN'T PLAY DISC 3 or 4,"I really liked the extended edition movie. It was even better than expected. Some pretty funny parts left out of the theatrical release.HOWEVER, as I see from other posters here, I am having the same problems playing any of the extras Discs. I've tried 2 players and neither of them can play them. To Amazon's credit, they've shipped out replacements quickly, but I give the ""studio"" or the ""distributor"" of these DVD's poor marks for quality control."
5,The Greatest Films of Our Time!,Lord of the Rings is nonstop action with hints of comedy and romance. All three movies are amazing! Peter Jackson did a great job of making the books become real. These movies have inspired me to read the books!
1,Tolkien must be turning in his grave,"The media hype surrounding this film should be an indication of how laughably bad it is. TTT has to be one of the worst movies since Plan Nine From Outer Space. It is just a muddy plotless mess, full of cheesy special effects, lame wannabe dialogue, lookalike characters, and totally devoid of any character development. I've seen better films on the SciFi channel, and that isn't saying much.The only people who could possibly enjoy this are videogame addicts, or individuals who get an intellectual challenge out of Wheel of Fortune reruns.The only reason to watch TTT is Gollum, a hilarious yet surprisingly pathetic cross between a homunculus, George W. Bush, and Donald Duck.Next time, the producers should pick a real director to film the Rings series - someone who knows how to humanize tragedy. Maybe Julie Taymor (""Titus"") or Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"") will take the challenge someday."
2,Even more extended version?,Please even extended edition that the original boring version? please... this is clearly a comercial move toward the theatrical exhibition. Who care about an extended edition of a already very long and extended movie? I hope there's no going to be a fourth movie of this series.Thank you.
5,Phenominal Film,"The Two Towers is one of the best movies this year. Peter Jackson makes a huge jump of genres from horror now to action/adventure. This DVD includes many bonus features including interviews, tv spots, everything. Watch for Return of the King to come out December 17."
5,Bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wat a film!!!!!!!!!!,"After i saw this movie i have to say, wow. wat a great film. I loved the first one and i think this one is even better. The acting is incredible especially from Elijah Wood and Viggo Martensen. I think this movie should have won at least a couple Academy awards. This has got to be one of the best films of the year!!! If this movie is any indication, i believe The Return of the King will be AWSOME!!!!!!!"
5,AN EPIC MOVIE MASTERPEICE!,"'THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS' IS AN EPIC MOVIE MASTERPEICE BECAUSE OF THE BRILLIANT SPECIAL EFFECTS, GREAT MUSICAL (SCORE), AND WONDERFUL ACTING. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY IT FOR DVD! AND BETTER YET I REALLY CANNOT WAIT TO BUY 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS' SPECIAL EXTENDED DVD EDITION! IT WILL HOLD VERY TRUE TO THE LORD OF THE RINGS BOOK TRILOGY."
4,Good Story and action!,I would definitely recommend to family and friends! A good story about friendship and working together as a team in order to accomplish a goal and endure nearly insurmountable odds.
1,I implore you to read the books!,"As a long time fan of the books I knew that it would be difficult if not impossible to make them into a movie(s) version.The technology is there to do it, but Peter Jackson and his screenwriters did not do the story justice.Yet if this will bring people to the truth, if this will get people to read the books and appreciate the genius of J.R.R. Tolkien then it will deserve the one star I give the movie(s)."
1,Snooooze,"This film is soo nothing. The only time its interesting is when Gollum is on screen . The rest suuucks. Stupid hollywood cheese jokes about dwarf tossing and skating a rail with a sheild. Embarrassing. Lifeless story and perfomances, bar Gollum. Worst of the Trilogy. Give me Krull anyday."
1,Come on!!!,Come on guys this is a boring pointless movie. I have never met any one who didnt like it. Most of the movie is talking. The hobbits look like freaks. I think the author had serios problems with his brain. Its like the movie makes everyone like it even though its one of the worst movies ever. The plot is crazy its all about a stupid ring. I know everyone is going to say its a bad reveiw but its my opinian andplease realize that LORD OF THE RINGS IS A STUPID POINTLESS UNREALISTIC MOVIE MADE BY A RETARD.
4,What happend to the storyline???!!!,I truly loved the movie however it does not follow the storyline very well. The book was here first. And it seems as if they created a remotely different story instead. I have been reading this book over and over since I was ten. This movie could have and should have been better. However I am hoping that the third and final movie will make up for it. (And quite a few of the male actors are hot)
2,"Terrific presentation, poor screenplay","Visually this movie is a masterpiece. The sets, the towns, landscapes, the creatures.. everything is right out of middle earth. In this area, the film truly shines and those working on this film are to be commended for it.I found the screenplay to leave a lot to be desired, however. Someone should tell the writers that they don't need to have a climactic moment every 10 minutes. This really killed the momentum of the movie. I was also a little disappointed at how they turned Gimli into comic relief.Watching this film was certainly a pleasure, but I can't say that I'd do it again anytime in the near future."
4,Good times,"Well, I will add my comments to the already 1437 reviews already posted... Defintely much improved over the theatrical version. Much more is explained and much more makes sense. Though it is over 3 hrs too long to watch in one sitting, I would say it is a worthwhile purchase to any movie collection. Though some parts I found somewhat overly melodramatic, this extended edition as a whole works quite well. Though, strangely I had the most affinity for Gollum. He is the most fascinating and fully fleshed out and, perhaps the most human character in the whole movie, and perhaps in cinema in the past few years. He embodies all of the contradictions in being human, both good and bad, and yet he is neither. I really feel for the guy. I guess we all have a little Gollum in each of us. thumbs up"
5,So It Doesn't Go By The Book Trilogy That Well. SO WHAT!!!,"It is nearly impossible for a movie to go by a HUGE book very well. ""The Lord of the Rings"" book trilogy is a really BIG book with many pages and chapters in it. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" was a great adaptation of the book trilogy it is based on and so is ""The Two Towers"" its sequel. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""Two Towers"" are both wonderful Oscar-winning movies! I can't wait to own ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" for DVD! It has great acting, an incredible musical (score), and superb award-winning special effects! Director Peter Jackson deserves an Oscar for all the hard work he has done directing the phenomenal ""Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy."
5,Best DVD ever...........,"Like it's predecessor, this DVD is jam-packed. I am pretty sure if you are reading this review, you have heard of or have seen this movie. I don't have to explain it. I will say if you loved the movie you owe it to yourself to get this DVD. It adds 40 min. of footage, there are TONS of special features, and it looks and sounds great. This is my favorite DVD of the year, by far. Highly recommended."
4,Headlong to Helm's Deep,"Faramir and Frodo in Osgiliath?...Nahhhhh...Peter Jackson blew it with that crap...Otherwise still a great movie...Can't wait till next year!...Don't expect any acting or best picture kudo's this year though...The story was too disjointed unless you saw the first and/or knew the books really well...Most of the beauty of the story seemed rushed...'Headlong to Helm's Deep', could've been the title...However, Gollum!!! what a marvel...There could possibly be a special acting category inaugurated this year for Gollum alone...Also I thought that Jackson had written out the Ents...I was amazed!!!...The flood was as first visualized 35 years ago...I just hope that the DVD version will restore some 'missing' parts to this all, as he did with 'Fellowship'...then in two summers, (2004) he can release all three 'longer' versions theatrically...(once they make back their money)..."
4,great,loved the movie it was awesome recommend it to an any one who can get lost in an imaginative world
5,The Lord of The Rings the Two Tower's,"This movie is Great! I own the Platinum Series Special Extended Edition. I never read the books, although I sould have when they were offered to me in the 1970s. Hindsight is 20/20 they say. It's worth your time and money to own this DVD! I own the first edition Lord of The Rinds-Fellowship of the ring as well in the same format at above!!"
5,A Great Movie,"""The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers"" is the best fantasy film ever! But the Tolkien purists on this site do not think so.... This is a great movie. I like Tolkiens ""Lord Of The Rings"" books too because I have read them. I happen to think that even though this movie does not go PERFECTLY with the book, it is still a great movie."
3,loved it anf hated it,Okay I love these movies dont get me wrong but I dont think this deserves a 5 star rating neither do any of the other. They are nothing like the book Sam jackson butchord the story. It would have been great if he had called it a remaging instead of lord of the rings. How can any one who has read all 4 books and I do not mean audio books. Even say these movies are close to the book dont get me wrong i loved them and I own them all but not worth a 5 star
5,The Two Towers,This was a must have for my collection. The price was excellent. I received it quickly and in better than expected condition PERFECT. I love how it has the Elvin translations and all the scenes.
3,Why no Purchase option???,"Ok I love Amazon digital video, but I have to ask why can't we purchase The Two Towers? We bought The Fellowship of the Ring (#1) and Return of the King (#3), but the second video in the triology can only be rented! My kids have watched this several times and the rental is now about as much as purchasing it outright. This seems like a scam to me and very unlike my other experiences with Amazon video."
1,"really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad movie","This movie is really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad. I would neither watch it again nor would I reccomendthat anyone else watch it because it is so really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad. It smells of rotten eggs anddead fish. It tastes like spoiled meat and burnt cookies. It is just so really, really, very, extremely, hideously bad."
3,Extra Scenes too choppy,"I love this movie - but many of the extra scenes don't mesh very well or break the mood. Case in point, toward the end of the movie, an extra scene involving Fangorn forest and the destruction of the Uruk-Hai after the battle of Helm's Deep abruptly cuts to Aragorn hugging Eowyn and then abruptly cuts to another scene with no transition. Also, many of the extra scenes are humorous, but they don't fit in the overall somber mood of the movie - such as when Pippin and Merry discover all the food and tobacco that Saruman is hoarding in Isengard. One scene that should not have been deleted is a scene in Osgiliath (a flashback), involving Faramir, Boromir and their father. This scene explains a lot about what drives Faramir and helps to flesh out Boromir...."
5,Extra scenes and Colin Duriez is a great mix to me,"The fact that the extra scenes are seemlessly worked into the DVD as if they were always there is the major plus to this DVD and made it worth the money alone. But we do also, in the fascinating ""making of"" interviews, get not just the usual making of interviews but also experts - and here it really is worth it just for Colin Duriez, whose books on both Lewis and Tolkien (and his wonderful new book on their friendship) gives it the extra edge that the previous DVD versions did not have. So buy it for the extra scenes and for Colin Duriez. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY (Carroll and Graf) and CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan)."
5,LOTR,I loved this movie as well as all the others. You should buy this. I can watch this over and over and never tire of it.
3,A Flawed But Good Film,"I will start by saying that even though I was disappointed by the how the book was adapted to the screen; it was still a good film. It visually stunning and all the locations were perfect. But I, like many others have said before, had several problems with how the book was adapted. FotR was perfect; it was everything I could ask for in a LotR film. But with Two Towers I'm still trying to justify some of the huge changes Jackson made to the story. I believe that some of the changes in the film altered many of the underlying themes and characters in book. It's not so much that he got the story wrong, he got the meaning wrong. I do have hope for the final film though. Jackson does say on the FotR extended director's commentary the Two Towers is the film the deviates furthest from the book. If that is true then RotK can only be better. Having said all that I still plan on buy the both theatrical and extended editions for all three films."
1,"My god, are you lemmings?","Don't get me wrong, The Two Towers is a great movie in its own right, but why are you all marching off the cliff after this piece of junk DVD? You've been through this with the last movie! They put out a normal copy, but then they put out the full movie, which is what you want, on an ultra-expensive ""extended edition."" New Line Cinema's marketers must be sadists. This edition has the special features I want, but it doens't have the full movie I want. The extended edtion will have the movie I want, but also the special features I DON'T. My friend bought the full-extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring for $... and sold me the actual movie discs for $.... I'd call that a better deal. If they make a third-edition DVD of the Two Towers, with the extended movie but normal special features, I'd buy THAT."
2,Not as comfortable as other BITE products,"I'm disappointed in the footbed of this shoe. I have three other pairs of very comfortable and well made BITE sandals and none of these other shoes have Croc footbeds in them. The Tempo footbed lining has the Crocs label on it and it is much thinner, less padding, slipperier and has less arch support than the other BITE footbeds. I haven't been wearing these Tempo much."
2,"Poorly packed, poorly delivered","Tool Crip ships this in the Porter Cable box. The box is thin cardboard and so when it arrived the box was almost in pieces. UPS had also dropped the generator and the frame was bent, spark plug was completely broken off, generator mount was bent, they really did a number on this one. Tool Crib was not very responsive in giving me a specific time to pick it back up and could not assure me I would not have the same experience on a re-shipment. I'd buy this item locally and skip Tool Crib given my poor experience with them. No one seemed to care or was concerned about my problem with their poor performance."
3,Not as many pieces as I'd expected.,"My 4 year old likes playing with this more than my 2 year old, but they both enjoy it. There are actually only two physical sets of parts, each double-sided to make-up the 4 stated in the description."
3,not what I expected,DID NOT WANT LEATHER CASING WITH ZIPPER CLOSURE. I WANTED A LEATHER BOUND BOOK WITHOUT A ZIPPER(WHICH ALWAYS BREAK). THE EXPLAINATION OF VERSES IS NOT THAT GREAT. NOT REAL GOOD REFERENCES FOR COMPARISON EITHER. I WILL PROBABLY GIVE THIS AWAY AS A GIFT OR RETURN IT. I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR A NKJ VERSION THAT IS AS IN DEPTH AS MY RYRIE AMERICAN STANDARD BIBLE. THIS BIBLE IS FOR SHOW MORE THAN SERIOUS STUDY.
4,the second best bible translation,"The NIV and many other translations are new age and go as far as confuse Jesus and satan, along with leaving out entire verses. The New King James Version is the best translation next to the King James Version. For some good reading material on this subject check out Gail Riplinger's books and dvds. God bless you. Gail's website is avpublications.com. Her dvds will open your eyes."
2,"Some parts worth reading, but the book is not worth buying.","Although many analysis of the information age is related to the new economy, but the entire layout of the book is not that good, and some economic concepts and strategies were so obvious that I think is common sense to many of the business people in the e-economy."
2,Information Rules Is Good If You are A PhD Economics Student,"My best advice for anyone even thinking about buying this book is .... click on and delete the wasteful and useless business concepts this book presents. Shapiro and Varian have some good ""economics classroom"" ideas and if that's where you do business the book is ok. But, if you are doing business in the ""real world classroom"", as most of us are, this book is far from having pragmatic business reality in it. To sum it up, just another ivory tower ""academic lesson"" book which some Masters or Doctoral Business student can cite in their thesis. This is certainly not a book that a Warren Buffet would come within a mile of."
2,Really?,"The book starts by proclaiming that neo-classical economics is adequate for explaining the information economy. This claim is not backed up in the book. First, textbook neo-clasical equilibrium theory contains neither money nor 'information'. Second, the book merely discusses qualitatively and nonsystematically ideas like positive feedback and increasing returns that were better presented by Brian Arthur. Third, even asymmetric information is not discussed (Ackerlof and Stiglitz are not even mentioned). Fourth (or zeroth), there is not a single empirical graph in the entire book, and nothing of modern ideas of network theory. So I would say that the book is more or less on the same level as Kelly's (pre-bubble-bust) ""New Rules for the New Economy"". All of these books implicitly hype the unregulated free market, in the face of both qualitative and empirical evidence that unregulated markets are not only unstable but are detrimental to human health and well-being."
5,Child learning about the world.,"Nancy in Seattle, WA : Excellent story about a Swedish boy finding ways to make sense of the things around him."
4,remove my stain and poly well,It takes about one sheet to fully remove the stain and polythene for a cabinet of 2 doors when you divide it in to 3 1/3 sheet. Not bad. It's better than some other brands I have tried.
1,Stay away from this one,This is a classic example of an amateurish attempt to market a CD. The music is a mismash of studio and live recordings and the sound quality is mediocre at best. One tune is comprised of two opening sample clips! Please stay away from this CD.
2,Bit of a dissapointment,"I loved City of Thieves, and although I really liked the writing, the end just didn't do it for me. I really didn't like any of the characters, and if I was supposed to feel sorry for the main character it just didn't happen. I'd say a B-"
2,Benioff attempts something new -- a thriller without a plot,"To be fair, this short novel is more a work of fiction than a suspense novel and more a novella than a novel. Readers are better off approaching it as a work of serious fiction.Judged as such: The writing is occasionally too precious but is often evocative; the characters are somewhat interesting. Middling.Judged as a thriller: The action directs itself towards the conclusion. The problem is that there really is no plot. It only seems to move in a direction when in fact there is no meaningful climax or resolution. It ends up being boring. I can't recommend it."
1,One star is a bit much.,"I forced myself all the way through this, trying to find the gold that the fawning reviews spoke about, but alas, it was all in vane. The protagonist is superficial and vane--he's a drug dealer--so what? Why would I opr anyone feel sympathy for a drug dealer?The prose is vapid, simplistic, and trite, and the plot is cliched--we've all seen the movie before.I now realize that half the five star reviews sound like a publicity department hyping a book. As more people are lured into reading the book, I suspect that more realistic reviews shall emerge."
2,Very disappointing,"Perhaps I'm not sufficiently nostalgic about New York city, where the events take place. Or should I say 'lack of events'. The first 190 pages follow 5 characters going through the paces of their lives the day before one of them starts a 7-year prison sentence. Their lives are largely uneventful, although they were portrayed realistically. Then, in the last 4 pages, some activity occurs and the book ends. There was no real tension, no suspense. The ending was neither shocking nor surprising. I'm glad I only spent 3 days getting through it."
1,It does not sound like french music,"Although the album is called ""french club night"", to my ear it doesn't sound french at all. The first disc contains hip-hops that sound lame and not particularly french; the second disc is all disco beats, with english voice-overs and lyrics. If this is 21st-century french music, I must have had illusions about french culture...huge disappointment."

1,This is ridiculous,"I live in the mountains of North Carolina and engage in many fun wilderness activities, and I was thinking that I would need a nice, simple mp3 player to suit my needs.This mp3 player has 64 megabytes of space. It is horrible.512 mb = 120 songs256mb = 60 songs128 mb = 30 songs64 mb = 15 songsThat's ABOUT what the sizes are. I can't even fit a whole King Crimson CD on it. Hell, I can't even fit a whole King Crimson SONG on it. How bad is that?Either way, no matter who you are, you don't need this thing. Hell, it's 100 dollars anyway. Buy some other mp3 player that has more space and get happy. Go for a Creative Zen or something.Jesus.And don't talk to me about ""upgrade cards"" because those are even more retarded.1/5 stars"
3,Docking Station Unavailable (per Creative!),"This looked like a great solution, UNTIL...the convenience of the docking station became a pipe dream. I sent an email to Creative Customer Support and here is their reply.Response from Creative: 8/19/2002 11:39:23 AMUnfortunately, the docking station is no longer available. We will not be receiving any additional stock.Best regards, ChrisIf you don't want the convenience of the docking station, then perhaps ok, but the only market for the docking station is from wholesale/auction type sources."
5,Magnificent,"Villasenor does not disappoint. His memoir is magnificently told and pulls no punches. As an elementary teacher that Villasenor would consider a ""good"" teacher ""that deserves...vanilla ice cream and applie pie... in heaven...because [I] care.."" I am so glad that he spoke the truth. ""Bad teachers have no excuse...""Villasenor speaks from the heart."
3,A little underwhelming,"This was a decent book, but it didn't really live up to its name. Good insight into Latin American culture and the effects of racism and ignorance on a child's psyche, but I wasn't all that impressed by the writing. Overall I felt the book didn't really deliver."
2,A novel or memoir ?,"The book says memoir, but I had a hard time beleving that a five year old or a group of five year old boys could do these things. I had to stop at chapter six."
2,Makes me wonder about other factual errors,"I am just beginning to read the book. I find it engaging, but already at page 19 there is a rather glaring factual error. Mansel asserts that the ""bridge on the Drina"" in Visegrad, BiH was ""destroyed by Croatian bombs in 1994."" I can only assume that he is referring to the bridge on the Neretva in Mostar which was destroyed during the Bosnian War. This is because no Croats were involved in the war around Visegrad and because whereas I have never heard of the bridge on the Drina being destroyed, the bridge on the Neretva was famously demolished and then rebuilt.The story itself is interesting, but I will read the rest of the book with a healthy amount of skepticism."
4,Photos are great for discussion!,"While the text of the book is not particularly inspiring, it is an introduction to the different ways some people live around the world. My daughter is not yet two but she loves Ann Morris' entire series of books and likes to identify things in each photograph. We use the books to discuss differences and similarities between how we and others live. The photos are obviously dated but I don't believe that alters the impact of what the author and photographer are trying to do. As she grows, we intend to continue to read these books, moving on from identifying simple items to talking about cultures, traditions, environments, geography, and etc. The back of each book contains a map and descriptions of locations/actions for each page and will allow us to talk about where places are in relation to one another. I recommend these books for curious children starting at age 18 months and all the way up into the school years."
1,poor primer,"A book with ostensibly some structure but lacks any logical lead through. I defy anyone to make sense of his few pages on structured bonds - all he says is that they're risky and those in the know have told him that many people do not understand them. I empathize with this lack of understanding - the author shares it.The author has a bizarre bullet point writing system - certain sentences are pulled out for emphasis for no good reason. The book is littered with grammatical errors.A real dud, spare your money."
1,No cushion,"3M 04801105682 6 X 5/8-11 Hook & Loop Disc Pad Holder #916There is no padding or softness to it. I never use it. I now use the smaller 3"" and 2"" with foam backing. This product is really not for sanding wood on a lathe. It may be fine for something else/"
4,Insightful!,"Most likely, if you're interested in achieving time management, you're not interested in spending a lot of your precious time reading about it. English author Frances Kay understands this and she knows her audience. Her succinct, practical guide offers tips and suggestions in such a way that you can open it to any page and glean valuable advice at a glance. Kay digs deeply into building time management skills in the office, though she glosses over time management outside the workplace. Although the book contains very few groundbreaking ideas, it does contain several ""kickstart tips"" that are very much like proverbs. And like proverbs, they should be taken to heart - they'll help you improve your time use. If you feel as if you've lost control of the minutes in your day, we assure you that you can begin the process of taking them back by picking up this book."
3,people don't allways have a dvd player in the computer!!!!,first of all i didnt know it was a dvd rom when i first bought it and the bad thing is a have to buy a new computer really a lap top with a dvd rom but i heard that it has gliches in it allot of gliches and allot of bugs so my friend had it since he had a dvd rom palyer and it was slow as hell but his cmputer is soo fast on other game like vice city and gta 3 its wired why is this game soo slow i only know its probally because its hell a lot bigger that the other gtas put together! graphics are good in it the gameplay was excellent and the sound is excellent you can put mp3 like cam'ron and diplomats its fun when doing that when just riding and listening to mp3'sgraphics 8/10sound 10/10gameplay 10/10overall 9.3 i know i gave it a 3 star but thats because its a dvd rom player not a cd rom i know some people should be pissed if they got this
1,I'm going to step out on a limb,"and just say that the entire Grand Theft Auto ""series"" is actually terrible. Completely overrated, how many cops can you kill and new-age ""mobsters"" can you knock off with this/these still being a fun game(s)? The answer, is about 2. This is a little off the topic but it's basically come to my attention that someone went through every single one of my reviews and voted ""no"" for being helpful. All i have to say about that is, whatever, it's cute. Vote yes or no, I still nabbed your attention ;)"
4,Great!,"I enjoyed this game some years ago on PS2 and after not being able to fly planes in the latest GTA I bought this download. Download speed was quick, installation was easy and the game is just as fun as I remember it."
2,Compatibilty issue,If you are a keyboard/mouse gamer then you wont have too much of a problem playing this game. But if you're like me and like connecting a game controller to your PC and playing your games on it then you'll have a problem. I bought both a xbox 360 wired controller and a normal game controller for the PC but it doesnt recognize the left and right triggers. I tried every little software program on the net to get it working but still no success. And don't even try to play the game without them because its just too clunky and you'll have left out game commands. But this game is pretty old it was made for Windows 2000/XP. And I have Windows 7 so I should have known better.
1,"Looks great, but wait for a patch!","I loved the other GTA games and was really looking forward to this being released on the PC. I was just about to break down and buy a PS2 when they finally made it available, but it appears to have been released a bit too soon. The consensus on the numerous unofficial GTA forums is that Q&A; only bothered to test this game under a few different configurations, and with a limited number of Nvidia cards. If you have an ATI card, there's a good chance you will experience my brand of frustration. I expect a patch will come out that fixes the various graphics and sound related problems, but for right now I am one of many who cannot really play the game.I'll followup with a more detailed review once the game is patched."
1,Buggy as hell,"I love the GTA games but this game crashes about every 20 minutes on me. I have been through settings, drivers, changed out hardware - and I still have not resolved the issue. While looking around the net this seems to be a very common issue for those of us who bought this game.I run a AMD 3200, 1 GB DDR 400, 128 Mb Nvidia 5950 -- my system has always been stable running games. My only conclusion is that this needs a major patch!!!!"
1,Very Serious Errors contained in this book...,"I recently purchased the above book, somewhat in desperation, as I was detecting conflicting information regarding the installation and configuration of MS Cluster Server (MSCS.) Unfortunately, I made a poor choice in purchasing the book. What the author skimped on was the actual installation of MSCS.While there isn't room to detail every omission here, the most serious of blunders occurs during his step by step install procedure where he mistakenly tells the reader that the MS Cluster installer is asking for the IP address of the NT workstation that will administer this cluster. This is in fact the IP address of the Cluster itself. This is a serious mistake and will result in the reader giving the IP address of another NT workstation to the Cluster which will ultimately cause an IP conflict.Personally, I would recommend reading the MS documentation several times rather than this book"
4,Good variation from our usual.,"Risotto is never our favorite, but this is a wonderful change from our usual fare. Plus it is Quick and easy and wonderful added to homemade soups and stew. I like adding veggies and cheddar overall if I serve it as a side dish. Everything Lundberg is wonderful ... esp. their rice pasta noodles. yum."
3,some good fun,"I must say, I was overly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think it was great or anything, but I had a fun time watching it. It sure beat the socks off the new 2002 movie The Time Machine. And also, my five year sister enjoyed Clockstoppers as well."
2,It Was Okay,"First of all, not every film pleases everyone. That being said I did not like it as much as some other films I've seen. Let's just say it was not my cup of tea and leave it at that."
4,Good book for applied seismologists.,A very good book for those who are interested in basic knowledge in applied seismology. Also lots of useful things about the seismic waves and data processing and interpretation in general. Really worth having!
2,Beware the XA601!,"I have tried Powerline products from various manufacturers, including the Belkin F5D4050 USB Adapter (don't bother, it's garbage), GigaFast PE902 Powerline Ethernet Bridge, the Netgear XE602 Ethernet bridge, the Netgear XA601 USB Adpater, and the Linksys PLUSB10 USB Adapter.What can I say about the XA601? It is cheap (you can get one from eBay for $12 shipped) and when it works it works great.The problem I have with the XA601 is when the unit is plugged into the electrical outlet for more than 24 hours the LAN connectivity stops. The only way to fix this is by unplugging the power cord, waiting a few minutes, and plugging it in again.Maybe the XA601 has a problem with overheating - I don't know. I emailed their Tech Support over a week ago and so far, no response.If you're looking for a Powerline USB Adpater I suggest the Linksys PLUSB10. The unit I have has been working flawlessly for over 2 months. But they are expensive and hard to find."
5,Great blades cut like razors,These blades are sharp as scalpels. I don't sharpen used blades because I cut really hard materials that chip the blades beyond repair. X-acto blades are stronger and last longer than third-party knock-offs.
3,Search out Obsessed on vinyl,"Whilst these are great to own on CD it's unfortunate that SPV/Steamhammer has done it so cheaply and with scant care for the originals. On Obsessed By Evil the track listing is completely wrong.Intros which are not separate songs are counted as songs (for example Outbreak Of Evil, a 4 and a half minute song comes up as only the 14 second intro).Furthermore, the last track, Volcanic Slut isn't even on the CD!!! The only reason I worked this out is cos I have the LP. The sooner someone reissues this properly the better."
2,"Cute, but....","I saw these today. Cute, but they look nothing like the botanical drawings I'm used to on the dishes and canisters I have. They have the name 'Portmeirion' on them, but they are made in China."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I bought this unit on Boxing day and have had nothing but trouble and Kenwood support is just uselss, the white images on a black background displayed a pink beeding stream. I had the first unit replaced only to find the new unit had the same problem. I contacted Kenwood and took it into a local repar center who took a couple of weeks to get back to me. I had to go into the repair center to show them the exact problem and then a week after that it was corrected by adding a capacitor. Now the DVD player is suppose to be compatible with all formats but it is not. The DVD player plays DVD-RW intermitently if at all and sometimes cannot read Disney discs. The repair center replaced the optical reader to no effect, and Kenwood is now asking for me to ship the DVD player to them for testing. Now it is late March and so essentially I've purchased a system that has spent more time in the repair center than at home and now I'll be without a DVD player for god know how long."
4,"Come on home, son.","This is the follow up CD to theLove, God and MurderCDs. Johnny Cash conceived of it shortly before he passed away. The idea was that it would be ""a summation of one man's days on earth, with his philosophy and life lessons woven between the lines"". Cash submitted his choice for the final tracklist four days before he died. Unlike theLove,God, orMurderCDs, the songs on this CD don't stick to just one theme. There are songs about God, the working man, love, injustice, patriotism, outlaws and many other subjects. It's a good selection of songs that features some of his best known songs alongside some obscure gems. Listen to the CD and you will have a good idea what Johnny Cash cared about."
1,Rip OFF,"It is pretty tacky when I paid $3.00 for the book pictured and is shows up with a very blurry pictures and a blue cover with the aforementioned 97 cent mark emblazed across the the word ""kittens."" My friends version is much nicer, is this an unauthorized fake copy? I cannot give it, even as a the little gift it was meant to be. I am REALLY disappointed. I think Roger Priddy would be, too."
3,"Some good songs, but...","I bought this CD right after I heard 'Big House'. It is one of the most explosive songs I have ever heard. And other songs on this album like 'My World View' and 'Rest Easy' are very good and well written. But one of the first things that occured to me when I listened to the other songs were some weak and poorly written lyrics in 'Can't Take God Away' and 'Let Love'. Also, 'My Scum Sweetheart' is a bizarre song for an otherwise Christian album, and 'A.K.A. Public School' sounds like a promotional from the teachers association. Overall, this album has some high adrenaline songs, but the rest fall on their faces."
3,Reasonable - But Not Their Best,"This is Audio Adrenaline's second studio album. The band was still searching for a style at this stage of the game, and the album remains somewhat uneven. Having said that, the band does challenge the views of faith on songs like ""Scum Sweetheart"" and ""Jesus and the California Kid"". The songs ""My World View"" (featuring Kevin Max Smith of DC Talk) and ""Don't Censor Me"" are excellent indicators of the outstanding band AA would become, and ""Big House"" remains a benchmark of Christian pop/rock. Overall, though, anyone wanting to find out more about AA should start with ""Underdog"" or ""Bloom""."
2,high hopes.....,"That were by no means met. I have never written a review on here before but this movie was exceptionally displeasing. I became excited in the opening, when I saw the lead actress....who I think is a great performer. Other than that, this was horrible. I f you want to see someone running around screaming and making the worst decisions for almost 2 hours this is your movie."
1,lmao,"""I don't want it"" is the stupidest, most distasteful song ever. Don't tell people how to have sex goddamnit!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good but no where near Jesus Freak or SuperNatural,It has got some good songs but no enough guitars used. A little to much rap.
4,Great Product Faulty Shipping,Loved the Product the only thing I had an issue with was the handle on the case was shipped broken.
3,don't buy the Kindle version,"I bought this for the Kindle thinking it would be the same. It is not a good fit for the Kindle. First of all, it is a workbook, so now you need to have a place to write the answers in. The second problem is that it was not formatted correctly in the Kindle version. Sentences are interrupted by titles. Foot notes are on the wrong page.And good luck trying to find the appendixes! I had to search by the word appendix as there is no table of contents. Overall, I think this is a great book and has a lot of good points. I just would recommend the print version, not the electronic."
2,"More silly and outdated rap from DC Talk [But, This one does proceed a classic]","This follow-up to the 1989 debut is slightly better, But still pales in comparison to DC Talk's later efforts. A lot of tbe songs on here are very silly and sound very outdated in many cases. But, There are a few positives about this cd. ''Walls'', ''No More'', and ''Talk It Out'' are the only reccomendable songs on here. If you like cheesy 80's and early 90's rap music, This cd is for you. If not, Go buy a Gospel Gangstaz cd or a Lecrae cd instead. Oh, And that classic that i said this album proceeded is the next DC Talk album, Free At Last. Hope the review helped. Be blessed"
4,Second album is great.,"This album presents a change in their sound, but it is still primarily old school rap and hip hop. It is fun. I like it, but if you only like DCT's more recent stuff, I'd suggest not to becase this is a totally different sound."
5,Just what I wanted,"I was very pleased when I received the Christmas Chipmunk CD, my daughter loves the chipmunks and this made an early Christmas present. The CD arrived very quickly and good as new. My daughter is still listening to it and keeps it by the computer, so not only is it great for the holidays she enjoys it all the time. Again, I was very please and if you are wondering about ordering something through AMAZON, you could not place your order with a better company."
4,Christmas With the Chipmunks,This cd was great the minute I ripped it into windows media player and started listening to the music it took me back to another time which was my childhood I remember listening to Alvin & The Chipmunks on the radio or hearing them doing their singing during A Christmas tv show they were doing so this was just as good now as when I used to hear them all the time back during my childhood and I am also planning on getting more of their music since I am A big Chipmunks fan have been ever since the first time I seen their tv program that used to be on.
2,"Cliches, Formula and Disappointment",It is obvious the writer used a canned formula he thought would be a financial success. Too bad many uninformed parents are falling for it and buying the book for their children. Big disappointment. Nothing original or thought provoking here.
3,Things you never knew,"I found this video interesting showing a side of Peter Sellers I never knew before. Due to his complex characters and his little known real persona it was sad to see the life he led, despite his renown humour that he was unable to find his real happiness due to the stranger intense relationship between him and his mother.This video is worth watching and then watching later the movie ""The Life and Times of Peter Sellers"" encompasses the real story of Peter Sellers."
1,Less than 1 Star. This movie was horrific to view!!,"I couldn't wait to see this movie. I went to BlockBuster to rent it and they told me it had been stolen off the shelf. I'm thinking ""wow, must be a really good movie"" so then I pay $14.99 to buy it. After watching the fabulously bad acting, listening to the seriously horrible sound (the actors appear to have dubbed their lines in after the film was shot) and the preposterously poor special affects I had to shut it off. I could barely watch 1/2 hour of it. It is THAT BAD. What the heck was Gary Busey thinking for God's sake?? I got suckered bad on this one, my only hope is that I can foist it off on someone else on E-bay. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS PILE OF CRAP!!"
1,Not a great MP3 player,The player frequently stops working and displays foreign characters on the screen. At times it seems to have mind of it's own. I do not recommend this MP3 player.
4,Good; no issues,"I bought this MP3 player to have something to work out with. It's easy to use and nice to have the icons to choose from on the main screen. This way I don't have to try and read something while I'm working out (so I don't have to slow down), I can just go by pictures. Easy to change tunes or turn shuffle on or off. I don't know much about the battery use since I have only used it about 5 times and have not worn the battery down yet. The overall sound quality is good and can be changed when using the EQ settings. I have not tried putting video on it either.Dislikes: no delete option while the song is playing (this option is available on the Sansa Fuse) and have to use Windows Media Player to create a play list (play list cannot be created on MP3 player itself)Otherwise I would recommend this to other people who are looking to just put music on an MP3 player and not using it for multiple purposes. Works well and sounds great."
5,"SanDisk - love it, love it, love it.","i love this product, i have purchased two, one for myself and one as a gift and will purchase another as a gift. received it in no time and it's very nice expecially for the cost."
4,small size great player,"it's a great player in a small container. Watching vcd is fun, about 10 disks fit on 6GB - I wish there was a model with more memory when I purchased the device. The rip software is a bit tricky, sometimes aborting without good reason, but it could be because of my older notebook (AMD 2500+). Also, so far I was not able to use another rip software like media converter et al. I would like to see more features, like compression and quality levels to choose."
4,This thing rocks!,"I looked at various options and selected this based on price.It came with a trial of Rhapsody and I love it. It sounds greatand is easy to use. I have had trouble with duplicate songs, butthis could be a user error. I was hoping the SD slot was removableto be able to share with my family, so we could put our own music onit, but this is not the case. I'm very happy with the purchase!"
4,Great alternative to ipod,"The Scandisk e series product work great. It truely is plug and play. A great alternative to the overpriced Ipods.However, that is also the main drawback. There are few accessories for the e series. To date I have been unable to find a hard cover that properly protects the screen. And like the Ipod, ScanDisk also nickles and dimes you by not providing a plug charger....Overall very easy to use (intuitive) for a great price."
3,Good but not great,"It's a good product. Solidly build (except for the badly designed USB connection, which I doubt would get loose in two months), large memory, very good video and audio, and very cheap. However, the buttons and menu system can be better designed, and Sandisk apparently abandoned the huge Asian market by not providing any Asian language support while the competition supports most of major Asian languages."
2,Another good idea...,"I think I've read all of Bebe Moore Campbell's books and I have been impressed with all of them except for this one. After the mother stopped speaking at the beginning, the book read like a manual on how to run a company. Very good idea--but the mother had so much attitude and such a good life to talk about---I wish Bebe would've brought her back into the story."
3,Excellent book of course...,"I enjoyed this book; however, I don't think it was BeBe Moore-Campbell's best. The challenges faced by the characters were realistic, but the ending about the business was a bit unreal."
4,Great Movie!,"Loved this movie...innovative and fun. Love Sherri Otari...great time to watch humor during the busy Holiday Season. If you like wacky, this is your film. Great writing and excellent acting. A must see."
3,about $11.00 too much....,"I'm new to Incognito (i do have his last 2) in a sense that I didn't get hip to him until 2 years ago. This one sounds too rushed or just not enough put into it. The vocals are sweet to the ears and some vocals aren't worth hearing because of the sad production. Maybe if the hefty import price tag wasn't on it, I'll have something more positive to to say about. The only 2 songs I've heard on underground radio were: ""slow down"" and ""Castles In The Air""....the reason I went out to buy this. Disappointed in the CD?........NO!......just ticked about what it offers for that price.oNe"
4,Really Good Book,"I was glad to see some real life context - and in America - of the vampire in history. Good, solid research and pleased overall. Would like to see yet more photos."
1,As stupid as it can possibly get,"Just when you thought Will Farrell couldn't possibly make a movie any dumber and more idiotic than his past few along comes this mess. Absolutely moronic from beginning to end. And what is Mark Wahlberg thinking? Not even worth ""free"". BnB Beatles Depot"
1,Total Garbage,"The language was terrible, the script was awful, and the plot was so unimaginative I couldn't finish this piece of garbage. Everyone who gave this a good review owes me an apology for making me waste my time."
1,Could have used more of everything,"Too long by half and not nearly as funny; the idea could have been priceless if not so clumsily mishandled/vastly overworked. Talk about beating a dead horse (a phrase I've never understood but in this context...). I kept forgetting that there was actually a case needing to be solved. Instead, countless distractions, yelling, prank playing, endless issues with a wife and a girlfriend. But yes, they finally did solve their case...only I forgot what it was in the meantime. I will say, as a concession, that Mark Wahlberg was funny while Will Ferrell faded into the background (little better than a prop).Most definitely NOT a keeper."
1,"The Other Guys, a disaster.",The Other Guys was a disaster in story and comedy. Crude unfunny humor. Unbelevable characters. And a plot that was incomprehensible and all over the place. The only good part of the movie were the end credits. So skip the movie and watch the end credits. Enough said!
5,Hilarious!!!,Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell are great in this flick as a buddy pair of NYPD cops trying to take on the city's top villains.
4,Strange but successful couple.,I enjoyed this movie. It has many memorable scenes and lines. I would recommend this movie to Will Ferrill fans.
2,Had potential but needed another screenplay rewrite,"This movie if it had another screenplay rewrite could have been so much better, it seemed to slog in the middle and it needed more jokes-"
5,Ballz Out Funny n shtuff,Totally funny. Will Ferrell made me pee my pants multiple times. This was uncomfortable because I was wearing corduroy and it like soaked in there. Not to mention I was in a theater with my Boy Scout Troop.
1,Hoped for great but was painfully unfunny,"I know I will get a lot of flack for it but I may have laughed only once. I love a great comedy but this was so badly written and the characters so tiring, that I couldn't wait for it to end. I almost did this as a blind buy, but thank goodness I rented it first. I am not saying you won't like it. Who can tell? But I didn't. The only thing I did enjoy was Eva Mendes."
2,Didn't hold my attention...,"Ok, I was hoping for more out of this movie but I didn't think it was all that funny. It had its moments, guess I just expected more of a laugh."
1,Unworthy to be cannon fodder,"Horrible movie. The acting and comedic style was a shameless cookie cutter of Step Brothers and proof that Will Ferrell should have given up after Anchorman. Even Mark Wahlberg falls victim to Ferrell's spewing of Step Brother branded comedy and he's actually the best actor in this movie, not like that means much. I'm glad I got this from Redbox and I highly recommend you do the same."
2,A throwaway movie. Waste of time.,"This movie has no idea whether its a buddy cop comedy, or a parody of one. At points its serious, and then it is the complete opposite the next minute, to the point of being rediculous.Will Ferell never ""goes there"" with his classic Anchorman rants, and Mark Wahlberg plays the most annoying character ever. It was just a mess of a movie, and I wanted to give it a low star rating, b/c I was sickened to see 4 stars, and so many positive reviews. Click the dislike button now, you freaking no-lifes. I'm not gonna respond to hostile comments either, so just to get this out of the way: SCREW YOU."
1,Really Terrible,I really thought this movie was so stupid - not good at all. Too hard to be funny and the story to me didnt make any sense. ...as well as some of the scenes. I like Mark Walberg - not his best work. I saw this at the movies - total waste of money and time.
2,Boring and disappointing.,"I really thought any movie with will farrell would be at least a pretty funny one. Turns out I was wrong. Maybe it was Walberg and Farrell's lack of chemistry IDK but this movie was so disappointing. a waste of time to watch, really."
5,Love the Prius scenes... just wish the digital copy included the extended scenes.,"This is truly a good movie. Totally underrated by the critics. It is funny, it has great scenes. I especially love the Prius. I feel it is more of the star of the movie than the two guys riding in it."
3,Digital Copy,"Love movie, but you sent me a digital copy that was expired, so i was a little upset by that"
3,Oops!,"I purchased the John Cleese DVD as a gift for a cousin living on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. So far I have received no complaints!The British part of the family enjoyed the seriew, and hope our cousins will too!Fawlty Towers, Vol. 1 - A Touch of Class/Builders/Wedding"
3,"Not enough ""umph""","I still went ahead and bought this 1400PSI McCulloch, even though I had doubts that 1400PSI may not be enough power for removing black mold off of my backyard concrete (I'm a sucker for low prices). Evaluation: After working with the machine various time, this 1400PSI McCulloch just doesn't have enough ""umph"". The black mold and stains remain. That said, I like the functionality of McCulloch. The machine is well designed, easy to assemble and easy to use. Overall, 1400 PSI is not enough for serious work around the house. If you just want to wash off your car, or hose down your deck, then this would be a good machine. But, if occasionally, you need to get down and dirty then buy more pressure than this machine gives. Conditionally Recommended"
1,You get what you pay for,"I used this thing twice for about 6 hours total. The third time it simply lost it's pressure and would not stay on. I called the 800 number printed right on the unit and waited for 35 minutes... no answer. I don't know about the rest of you out there... but when I have invested too much time and the company won't talk to me when I call... I have to throw in the towel because I could be doing something productive. Chalk it up ""you get what you pay for. What was I thinking? $78.99 for a pressure washer? It WAS too good to be true. I can't recommend this thing unless you only plan to use it once and throw it away. You That's what I am doing. Sorry McCullough... I don't have time to wait 35 minutes for you to tell me where to take the unit and then wait 10 days or more to get it fixed."
1,Evolution Should Not Be Presented As Factual,"Evolution - a religion for those who don't want to believe in a sovereign God. That's right folks, evolution is a theory. There is no evidence in the fossil record of whales evolving from land based animals. Dig deeper. The whole theory of evolution is falling apart these days. And it's outrageous that some are trying to teach our children that this stuff is indeed fact, when it is not. We need to be telling our kids that they are special - that they were created by a God who loves them, wants the best for them, and has a purpose for their lives. But no. These people would tell your kids that they came from apes. From goo to you, by way of the zoo. Garbage. For you real thinkers out there, ask yourself the honest question: Where did the universe come from? Logical analysis concludes that only an eternal God could have brought it into being."
5,Great starter,"This book, while very simple, is the perfect starter book for preschool children through second grade. The illustrations are neat and kept my daughters interest, the information is accurate, and the end of the book features ""Our Family Tree: A Timeline"" which very simply walks you through a timeline starting with our single cell ancestors to our first modern human ancestors. While the timeline fits on two pages there's a note at the end that states ""This timeline is not drawn to scale"". I got a kick out of that one."
5,Great evolution story - scientific but also a good tale,My 4yo daughter was asking about where the first people and dogs came from so I looked into different books to explain evolution. This one is perfect for her age because it is not technical at all though not inaccurate - it tells the story of evolution with beautiful words and pictures that read like a creation myth. People have always had creation myths and evolution is really no different. It doesn't have to be just boring technical stuff - it can also be a great story. I think this is a great book for children (and adults).
3,"Lights, Camera, Where's the Action?","This DVD would be very entertaining for someone who has never seen a real porn before. It has all the essentials: thongs, legs, breasts, boobs, thongs (did I say that already?) The only thing it's missing is action. I bought this DVD looking for action and I was very disappointed. The one lesbian scene they do have, THEY DON'T SHOW. The cameraman is focused on the wrong thing. Other than that I guess it's a decent DVD, I was just looking for something a little more hardcore."
4,Stressed out in Iraq,As a deployed soldier in Iraq I needed any kind of relief I could get and I am thankful I invested in this. I have found a lot of helpful tips on this video.
2,Disappointed,"I very much wanted to love this book. The premise was intriguing and the first line, ""We are each the love of someone's life"", roped me in immediately. Unfortunately, I felt like I had to constantly convince myself to keep reading, that the eventual payoff would be worth the effort. Sadly for me, it wasn't. I found the story slow in unfolding (too much time in the early part of the book repetitively setting things up regarding Max's ""condition"") and the characters difficult to embrace. There were some redeeming moments - the descriptions of turn of the century San Francisco, the return throughout to the theme defined in that terrific opening sentence, but overall I expected more and have found myself unable to enthusiastically recommend this book over others I have recently finished reading (such as ""The Shadow of the Wind"" and ""The Kite Runner"" to name two)."
2,Am I The Only One?,"Am I the only one who found this story plodding and trite? The premise - young man in old man's body - gets old fast. Then what? ... An obsession on a 14-year-old girl that comes across as somewhere between Jerry Lee Lewis and Humbert Humbert. Under any other guise, this guy would be borderline stalker no matter what age he looks or feels.The writer has a nice style, particularly with imagery. Other than that ... a waste of time and money."
4,~~ The Obsession Of Love ~~,"Quite a story, it was. Ok, you know the premise: Max is born looking like he's 70 & he basically ages backwards. The novel is well-written; Greer just has a way with words. The story is a very odd tale of love & examines our own selfish wants & needs. You can't help feeling sorry for Max & I wonder- did anyone grow to despise Alice like I did??There's no huge mysteries in this book, but its odd tale keeps you turning the pages. I enjoyed it thoroughly, simply because it was an unusual tale of love, love lost, & found again."
3,"Nice idea, but overall it didn't blow me away","I liked the idea of this book. Someone is born (looking old), then grows up (as he physically looks younger and younger). The plot has a nice addition where the main character is able to interact with the love of his life pretending to be 3 different people. First at the age of 17 (he looks like an older gentleman), then later around the age of 30 (he looks about 40) and finally at the age of 59 (he looks about 11).Their love, however, does not seem like a true love (making the characters less appealling to me). Also, Max's confessions (and the means from which you know what happened in his life) are rambling diary entries.The book wasn't awful, but it didn't really live up to what it could have been. I liked the characters okay, but I wasn't enticed to root for any of them. As an earlier reviewer said, pick the Time Traveler's Wife over this one."
5,An absolute joy to read,"I am in grad school, busy reading assignments, yet the draw of Max Tivoli was too powerful. After reading a wonderful review, I couldn't wait to get started and I am so glad I did! Max Tivoli is one of my all-time favorite books, next to The Man Who Fell In Love with the Moon by Tom Spanbauer (sp?). This book is an absolute joy. Buy it, then be prepared to buy it again and again as you share it with everyone who you can think of...it is a wonderful escape.If only college textbooks were as engaging and fun to read!"
5,Magical!,"Not just a book, or a story, ""Max Tivoli"" is a small miracle. You enter the story as one might fall down the rabbit hole, or walk through the mirror. This is great literature, a spellbinding tale that will brings tears of wonder, of joy, and of sadness. Like on a magic carpet, Andrew Greer whisks you along on his ride through time and space, none of which seems quite familiar, yet all of which is at home in the heart. I cried at the end. Not only because of the many heartbreaking stories told in the book, but also because I had finished reading it."
3,Missing the feeling . . .,"While this book was well written, and I love quirky novels, something was really missing for me. The characters were not well-developed and were not particularly likeable, with the possible exception of Hughie.Max could have been quite an endearing sort, but he just wasn't. In the beginning of the story, I imagined him smelling of sweat and cigars. Even in his youth, he wasn't compelling or sweet. I just could not shed any tears for Max or even care. This, after reading another novel, The Book Thief, which really [...] me in and had a huge cast of memorable characters. While Max was easily readable, I just didn't care about either him or Alice. Oh,well."
3,Glitzy but static,"This book left me a bit cold. Great colors and all, but the guys here are so self-centered and self-absorbed, and I couldn't feel they could tell me something. Much better Hanson in Chelsea Boys, and if you're looking for beautiful boys with feeling, look at Joe Phillips' boys!"
3,"Not Original Performers, but good knockoffs","After I bought this, I was disappointed to realize that these songs are not done by the original artists. They are performed by the ""Countdown Dancemasters."" However all the songs are great if you like 1995-96 dance music. And the songs are very well done and sound almost like the original artists. There are only a few songs where it is noticeable that they are redone. The song pace, beat and singers are very close to originals."
4,"Excellent and very thorough, some color photos would be nice","If you want to dive into the world of travel photography or brush up this is an excellent book. It is full of information, not only on the technical side with lighting tips with the use of flash and film, the difference in what to expect between color and black and white, but also includes tidbits on where to travel, suggestions on what to carry to minimise loss of luggage. In addition the self assignments are instructive and very useful. One minor quirk the lack of color photos, i guess this was done to keep the price of the book down given its size but a few color photos would have added emphasis espicially when discussing general color filter use!"
3,A great guide for solitary A.'.A.'. work,"This book is an excellent guide to working the A.'.A.'. system in a solitary fashion and especially with the various organizations in the thelemic community asking for cash and services for the price of attainment. The A.'.A.'. system can be persued successfully without any teacher ranting and raving and should be in my opinion. The author's background is one of much intrigue and his involvement with a book such as this is a productive and asset to any serious thelemic student yet unfortunately his biases weren't left out and it is evident. This book is worth the price for the craftsmanship put into this book, photos, nice paper in a complete package."
5,A Complete Book,It's a great book! Introduce the presentation covering the basic topics in Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic. The methodologies of the Genetic Fuzzy Systems are presented in a very clear way.
1,Don't waste your time!,"I read lot's of books on business, improving your performance on your job, and the like. I found this book to be void of any meaningful content, to the point of lameness. While I sincerely respect the Dalai Lama and his philosophies, this book comes across as a make work assignment dreamt up by Howard Cutler because he ran out of things to do for a while. Don't bother with this one - there are many other books out there that will help you to improve your outlook and performance on your job and career."
2,Dying After Only Six Months,"This is the original equipment battery for a T60. Same power (5200 mAh), same fit, same finish, same everything as the original battery. Works great. Computer doesn't complain about aftermarket battery. UPDATE - After only six months, this battery is starting to die. The T60's built-in battery diagnostics now says the battery is ""poor"" and ready to die. I've treated the battery well, following all instructions and computer settings for optimal battery life to no avail. The battery seems like an OEM battery, but works like aftermarket junk."
2,This product is not a guninue Lenovo battery.,Every time I turn on my Think pad I get a warning that this is not a guninue Lenovo battery.
4,Good Job For the Money,"This product does everything it says it will do. Software loads easy & start using it quickly. My only complaint is batteries do not last as long as it says they do & it does not always locate the exact address, so sometimes you have to search around. In order to verify addresses you will definitely need to have Google Earth & internet access."
1,Rip off,I paid $ 14 plus and I received 1 brush. I thought I was buying 48 brushes. Unable to contact seller for help. I guess I am stuck. What a rip off.
3,So-So picture quality,"I must have gotten a lemon, or all the reviewers here must be used to lousy picture qaulity. In ""full light"", it does an average job. But on ""medium light"", it is horrible. I tried to record a school talent show, and it came out VERY pixelated. It was also frequently out of focus. And seemed to have problems compensating for the fact that the stage was very bright, but the auditorium was very dark. I would buy a higher end unit if you want good quality keepsakes."
2,Same video quality as my little digital camera & way more time consuming.,"I researched and researched camcorders and this seemed like the best choice. I was wrong. The video quality was about the same as my little digital camera. The worst part was the software that came with the camcorder. I wanted to just upload video directly from the hard drive, but you have to use their software. In the end it took twice as long to get the video into a useable format than it would have to burn straight to DVD and then upload to my computer."
3,Chipped Handle,"It was a wedding present, so I was very disappointed in the large chip in the top of the handle. There was no time to return it. We gave it as part of a group of grill items. I'm sure it will work well...just a shame they did not have better quality control."
5,Love the stork,This is a very nice stuffed animal and my grand-daughter loves it. I got it for her shortly after little brother showed up at her house!
1,"Not the series that is a problem, but this set is terribly overpriced!","First off, the series is very well done and a lot of fun to watch. Ban and Ginji are very funny characters, and they always seem to get the job done. Other characters are quirky and interesting, and there is a lot of emotion packed into some parts of the story making it more than just a pure comical series with some real emotion tied into the slapstick of much of the series. There is also good action and animation that tells the story very well. Why the negative review, then? $90 plus is unreasonable for this SECOND SEASON ONLY box, when the complete two season set is ten dollars less. Some of you may already have season one, but it actually makes more sense to have a duplicate copy of the first season and pay a lot less money than to spend over $100 (with shipping) for only half of the series. Give your first season box set to a friend and buy the two season set instead of this."
2,Not her best work,"I love Millers books usually, but this one was predictable and the one interesting charecter the brother, was so undeveloped it was unbelievable."
5,BEST CD I OWN,"YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS, LISTEN TO IT IN ITUNES. THE BEATS AND GUITAR MAKE IT THE BEST. THEIVERY CORP PRODUCED IT SO IT HAS A HIP CHILL SOUND> THIS IS A MUST BUY, YOU BUY NOW!!!"
4,hypnotic music,"Federico Aubele's album on ESL comes as a refreshing twist in the downtempo/international music scene. Taking guitar-rich songs from his native Argentina, packing them onto the thievery-built sonic cruiser and stopping off in Kingston to drench it all in dub.There are plenty of dub records out there, and plenty more from Argentina, but this may be worth your time if you dig mellow, haunting downtempo songs with both live and sampled vocals. Good music for chillin'.The one drawback, I guess, is that this music can seem too-much like wallpaper or fashion music. But taken as part of a deep collection of music or for inclusion in mixes - I'd say this record rates as a classic of its genre. B+"
4,Motivated Psychos,"A funny / sad movie that starts in a the streets, consolidates in a manicomio, then explodes in the streets. Pablo is Echarri is frighteningly convincing as a motivated terrorist under the banner ""Los derechos no se negocian."" The power of the individual to terrorize, no group needed. Just an idea and a will and madman could confound the authorities."
3,Using for storage now,"I have one similar to this, I bought mine from ABC Distributing, and I liked it at first, but then my bed sits high, so it comes up just enough to be on top. If I have a thick comforter on my bed, I can forget about it. I bought it to have something for my laptop to be on while working in the bed, but now it's just sitting to the side. The little part for your mouse is on the opposite side for me. I am right handed, and therefore the little table gets in the way. I think I'll either send it back to ABC or sell it at a garage sale."
2,M-D Building Products 49054 Tile Nippers,No issues with the seller. The Nippers did not perform as well as I would have expected. I ruined some tile pieces because they did not nip the pieces like they should have. Instead it would crack or chip the entire piece that I was trying to fit into place. So I invested in a wet tile cutter.
2,Nothing That I Would Request Watching.,"This movie, I really don't like these kind of movies, but I'm an Ontkean fan and he is in the movie. I didn't like the movie tho."
1,madame hillary,"This book should be in the fiction department and not in nonfiction. This book is selfserving, pompeous and hides the truth."
2,"A few tips, but not worth buying",If you find yourself navigating the online bible (SQL Books Online) to figure something out then you are better off buying something else. I was dissapointed that no value was added beyond what you can get from the online books.
4,"Easy to use, flip lid wasn't very convinent","I love grilling vegetables and I have quite a few grilling baskets for different purposes. I got this for veggie. The size of the basket is good, enough for 4 adults. The lid is flipping on the narrow side and I found it could be awkward when you open it and try to serve the food into the plates. It just hang and I have to lift the basket really high or ask my husband to help to hold the lid. It's relatively easy to clean. There are some hard spots when the grid overlaps. Again, I wish the lid was removable rather than fixed on the narrow end."
5,Happy beader,"Just the book I needed to size beads and learn more about the craft. Lots of information and ideas, very useful book , and nice price."
5,"Just The Facts! The Nuts and Bolts, Too!","I live in an area where there are no beading classes/workshops, bead stores, or beading buddies. It's just me with the urge to start beading, NOW!!I work from my own ideas and designs, I just needed to learn the basics and what kind of beads might work best for the projects in my head. This book fills the bill, and as previous reviewers mentioned, it is compact enough to keep in your beading supply kit. It may not be the only beading book you'll acquire, but it truly is a companion book! Thank you, Beadwork Magazine, for publishing this no-nonsense book!"
5,Granddaughter loves it !,This is just one of the movies I have purchased for my granddaughter to watch when she comes to Nana's house and believe it's her favorite. Nana always enjoys it too. If your child is an animal lover or in my case grandchild they will love this one. Very glad that I purchased it !!Bev
4,A Wonderful Video,"I bought this for my son, who is 13 months old. He loves the Teletubbies, and is in Teletubby heaven with this tape and Silly Songs and Funny Dances. At first, I cringed at watching the Teletubbies, but after seeing my son watch it and the smiles that it brought to his face, it made me changed my mind; I actually thought it was cute. He watches this tape so often that I am now considering buying it on DVD so that he has a spare copy. By the way, my son also loves the Sun Baby and the squeals of laughter that come out of her! Anything that makes my son that happy even if he's watched it over and over again is ok by me."
5,Love this workout!,"The first time I just viewed the video to see what I was in store for. But when I first did the workout, I enjoyed it. You really get a very good workout and sweat. I would recommend this video to anyone who is willing to do the work to get the results done. I love it, I will be doing it again today because I know this is a workout that I will burn the calories. Just do it and you will love it."
2,Not worth the money,"Does magnify, but does it in a very blurry way. The swirls in the screen catch room light and cause any white background to be brighter and the print faded.I wanted it for reading small print, it doesn't work. It DOES, however enlarge streaming video very well.I would say maybe a $30 price tage might be better. Was NOT worth $99."
3,Not what I expected,This was not what I expected - but am sure works well at what it is designed for.
1,NOT FOR TECH USE: Does not diagnose correctly. Warning.,This will NOT tell you if your power supply is good or bad. I test power supplies often and this will test a power supply showing good BUT when you put that power supply to a motherboard and try to power it on NOTHING. Hook another power supply to the machine and the computer works. You could have just made the wrong diagnosis if relying upon this item.This is a pretty toy but not a tool. You may wrongly diagnose a motherboard as being bad because of this. Maybe it has something to do with a motherboard putting more of a load on a power supply than the LED's in this tester.Mark my words- don't rely on this for real testing. You will keep bad power supplies (unless all you were going to power were LED's) and throw away good motherboards. Can we put a load on this? I really do need a good tester. Anybody??
4,Limited,"Truly, this is ONLY a quickie voltage checker, and not a complete diagnostic piece of equipment. If there is something else wrong with your power supply, it cannot test or indicate that. I'm happy with this product (bought 2 of them), but yes, I wish that it could do more. For what it is designed to do, it does very well, but don't expect it to be an exhaustive tester of all functions. As others have pointed out, it is very possible to have a power supply that passes all voltage tests, but will not power up your computer. The other reviewers are complaining because they paid for a VW and expect it to be a Maserati."
5,Stunning and amazing,"I've been anticipating this cd for months. I was even more excited after seeing Rascal Flatts back in February. I knew from the very first song that this cd was and is going to be a HUGE hit. ""Me And My Gang"" is a stunning beautiful cd. Laced with sweet ballads, inspirational tunes and upbeat and fast songs, this cd is a one of the best I've ever heard and or owned. If you doubting about buying this cd, don't even hesitate. It is worth every single penny. And after you listen, you'll absolutely agree."
5,one great album after another,"Music and Lyrics are outstanding. From the first album to the fourt, this is definetly a big hit. I reccomend everyone that has liked any albums in the past to purchase this one. New songs like ""Ellsworth"", and ""Stand"" our awesome, and most definetely their big radio hit ""What hurts the most"". If you purchase this 13 track cd you will throughly enjoy every minute of it. I have purchased the album myself, and from the day I got it, it hasn't left my cd player, from my car to my house."
4,Me and My Gang,"I found this CD to be a good mix of ballads and upbeat numbers. I bought it for the track ""What Hurts the Most"" but found that each cut could pretty much stand on its own. I really enjoyed the cut ""Backwards"" with it's tongue in cheek motif. Even if you're not a big country fan, I think you will find this CD worth adding to your collection."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...by the time you reach the most annoying song ""Backwards"" you'll wish you could have all the time back you wasted on this generic country music."
4,Feel Good Music,A friend of mine turned me on to Rascal Flatts and since then I can't get enough. I really enjoy their music and the stories behind the lyrics.
3,meditation,This is one product I feel leaves a little to be desired. I did not like the format and the presenttion.
3,Not Experienced Enough,"I purchased this DVD several months ago. I found the positions to be too dificult for me to do. I tried to get into it, but eventually gave up. I found the positions were not explained well enough for a beginner to perform. The location where this was filmed was pretty, looks like Joshua Tree. I am currently taking a beginning yoga class where I can ask questions and not attempt to try something that could end up not being beneficial."
2,Some poses were LOL ridiculous,"I watched this DVD through before attempting the poses. By the second ""relaxation"" pose, I was laughing out loud. Rodney had placed the yoga strap behind his back, around the feet, around the ankles, and pulled his legs in like a trussed up turkey. To lean back properly in this position, he had about three blankets, a gigantic bolster, what looked like a foam wedge, and a few other unidentifiable pose helpers. It was really ridiculous. Nor were alternatives offered, or help with the set up of this complicated wedge, blanket, bolster arrangement. I do not appreciate yoga that over uses props, and this one pulls out all the stops. It would take twenty five minutes to even attempt to jerry rig blankets and such to attempt this pose. Not so relaxing. Even the pose with the wall included lots of props; wedges and such. Very disappointed with this DVD. Returned it."
4,Relaxation DVD,"Excellent condition. It is a good DVD, but the speaker has a slight speach impediment or accent that I wasn't used to."
5,excelente,"Muy, muy bueno... (Please forgive any orthographic mistakes, i am writing from Greece).i ordered ""los animales"" for my two-year-old daughter. Shewas left speechless since she saw the demo in youtube. She totally loves it.Now she can repeat many words and animal names.The spanish teacher in the dvd and the children are so sweet... And the graphics arevery good, too. We also like the songs. We have also bouht ""vamos a jugar"", ""adentro y afuera"", y ""las estaciones"".All ver nice."
4,BIA Cordon Bleu 3 1/2 quart rectangular baker,"When this arrived, I was disappointed with the shape. It is not a percect rectangular shape. All 4 sides curve inward to some degree, which is deceiving from the picture. Once I got past that, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to others. I used it today to bake a strawberry rhubarb crisp for company and it looks great."
4,good lower body workout,I definitely felt my lower body the next day. The only thing I don't like is that every one of the Turbo Jam workout has the same exact warmup. I like a little variety.
3,All topics related with the auto-power-on and auto-reset problems are GONE !!!,"There were several posts here two weeks ago, discussing the auto reset of the TV, now they are all dissappeared???Last time I came here I saw 8 post, now only 3???"
2,Very Basic.,"This is a very basic book that tells very little in the way of raising children.The main point of the book is this: Look for the positive and praise it and ignore the negative behavior.For example, if your child whines when you tell him/her to clean his room you praise the fact that he picked up five of the toys without whining. Ignore the fact that the child whined while picking up the other 200 toys. The idea is that eventually the child will pick up the whole room without whining.Ha- I haven't found that to be the case while teaching and I haven't found that to be the case with my children (age two and younger).I think you can easily skip this book and find a more comprehensive book with more ideas that are better suited to reality."
3,No show,This DVD did not make it to me. It got lost in the mail. The seller ended up having to reimburse me for it. I will say that I was treated very well and will do business with this seller again because they took responsibility for the problem. THANKS!
5,continuo,"An excellent jazz trio and quartet CD from Israeli bassist Avishai Cohen,very solid yet still adventursome music highly recommended if you enjoy European and Scandinavian jazz trios.Superb musicianship."
5,Good flick,I had forgotten how funny this movie was. Was definitely worth a re-watch. Robin Williams was perfect for the part and Shelley Duvall was a perfect Olive Oil.
2,Popeye,"After seeing Shelley Duvall again in Annie Hall after all these years, we thought it would be fun to see her as the role she was born to play: Olive Oyl. The movie has redeeming moments -- a few -- and Duvall is utterly in character, but the movie was peculiar (not in a way that improves with time) and was a slog to get through. Shame, that."
5,Popeye,Had this on VHS tape. Had to get rid of VHS player and wanted a copy on DVD. Very funny movie.
1,Worst movie ever made.,"I can't even go into details, it's THAT bad (I could have a seizure or something if I try to summon up the memories.). What boggles my mind is how Robin Williams could somehow segue from this rubbish to The Fisher King - one of the all-time great films ever made. I actually saw IT (can't even say the P word anymore) when IT first came out and IT was the only movie I ever felt compelled to walk out of. Over 20 years later - only because I love Robin Williams - I decided to give it another chance. Guess what? Still the worst movie ever made. Period."
4,Great movie,"I think Popeye was a great movie, personally. I really enjoyed the songs, sets, costumes, and Robin Williams is perfect as Popeye. I can't wait to own this on DVD, where it can be seen in its original widescreen format with beautifully restored picture and sound.And a note to vhspreowner - Disney and Paramount have actually had a pretty good relationship, even after Popeye went bust, (Which actually wasn't as bad as many think - it grossed $50 million domestically, making a $30 million profit.) including Paramount's recent collaboration with Disney (through Miramax) to produce The Hours."
5,"Popeye embodies loyalty, kindness and good manners","Altman's ""Popeye"" is one of the most under-rated films ever. A superb cast bring to life the humanity of Segar's characters, rather than the violence of Fleischer's animations. Shelley Duvall, though, just about steals the show with her magnificent Olive Oil, although Harry Nilsson's wacky songs - particularly ""Everything is Food"" - and Wolf Kroeger's amazingly dilapidated Sweethaven rival the brilliant actors for inspiration. This film is just too good to be left to kids. Thank you to everyone involved."
4,I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,"I hadn't seen Altman's Feiffer-scripted version of theE.C. Segar stripin twenty-five years or more, but my two tween sons were a great excuse, and POPEYE is actually a damn good (if utterly idiosyncratic) movie. Yes, it's a musical. Yes, all of the characters are utterly caricatured. Yes, it does lose track of itself more than once, and starts too slowly. And, yes, the spinach thing is done much less subtly or well than Segar would have. But it's indisputably Popeye -- and miles closer to Segar than any other moving-picture version has ever come -- and a hell of a lot of fun."
3,An interesting failure,"This movie has lots going for it: Robin Williams is great as Popeye and his mumbled lines are perfect, the set design is excellent, and there are some very sweet moments. But it's way too slow, too long, and the songs SUCK - yes they do. This film might have been better if someone besides Altman had edited it down to about 85 minutes and dumped the tunes. Overall: worth checking out, but don't be surprized if you hate it. Trivia: Look for Dennis ""NYPD Blue"" Franz as a Tough in the barroom brawl."
3,pretty good for an off brand,"I have a student with one of these models. His mother had bought him this instead of getting a rental, which would have been $500 or more a year.His instrument has nice projection and is very free blowing. Intonation is not perfect, but it is reasonable. It's really quite good for an off brand, many of which are out and out junk. He'll need a better one come high school but, for now, this one will do."
2,Pillow Protectors,I was very disappointed with the overall quality of the product. The items arrived in different packaging than pictured. I had used the pictured products before and was very disappointed when I received a lesser quality item than was displayed. I would not order this item again.
1,It doesn't depict racist attitudes; it is racist,"I disagree with reviewers who say that if you know history you will understand that this book merely depicts racism of the era. No. It is is propaganda that helped fuel racism of the era. I love Gene Stratton-Porter's other books, and in them she depicted protagonists who are victims of prejudice: victims of social class prejudice, and victims of prejudice against women. And these discriminated-against protagonists ultimately triumph. In this book, however, she turns characters into racial caricatures--the idealist, pure, earnest, white female protagonist versus the evil, conniving, murderous, Japanese antagonist, who dies in the end because that's what he deserves. Sure, study it as history. But point out that the author succumbed to racism. She didn't explore racism."
3,So So,"The Book was actually pretty Good Quality, however, you could tell that it was Mass Produced due to the 20 or more mispelled words and typo's that we found."
2,Skip this one...it will make you cringe.,"I just discovered Gene Stratton-Porter 2 months ago and fell in love with her books. I eagerly read everything I could get on Kindle and enjoyed it all until I hit this book. I was so surprised to come across the word ""Jap"" early in the book and thought it must be some mistake. As the book went on, I kept trying to make excuses for the author as the racism and white supremacy became more prevalent but I was just shocked and saddened by it and by the the way it was a running theme in the story and that the leading characters, who were so likeable in every other way, were presented as strong and wise people because they recognized the foreign threat and the need for white supremacy. I couldn't believe this was printed and I wish it hadn't been as it has forever altered my view of the author. I still love her other books and I do understand that she was a product of her time but it was still sad and disappointing. Skip this, you'll be glad you did."
2,Several Problems,"I bought this watch before I started college in the fall of 2008. I bought it in early August, and by January, I had to send it back to Fossil because the minute hand was loose inside the face of the watch. It took them two months to get it back to me. In April, it just stopped working. I thought it was the battery, so I had it tested. It wasn't. It was a problem with the watch. So in less than a year the watch had two problems and apparently died on me. I sent it back to Fossil for the second time last week and I'm currently waiting on them to return it. I asked for a new watch and I hope to get one. I liked the way the watch looked and fit, but it just did not consistently work."
1,Poorly written,"If Tom Clancy actually wrote 'Hidden Agendas', he needs to retire. If he didn't, he needs to apologize, at least to me for buying this dross expecting a good read. I feel cheated."
2,"Oh, please....","Like a government agent on the trail of a deadly terrorist is going to stop and take the time to write a new VR 'scenario' each time he searches the net for a clue? Please... I really like the concept of a high-tech fiction genre, but so far I haven't found an author with even a hint of technical believability. Clancy should pull his name from this series immediately!"
2,"This is not a ""Hunt for Red October""","Mr. Clancy's more recent books have been on the down-slope. Hidden Agendas is not lacking in ""filler"" verbage to take up the space between the book's front and back covers. True there is a plot, but this book is no ""Hunt for Red October"". Mr. Clancy has the potential for being a great author, however, this is not reflected in his later works, such as Hidden Agendas."
3,Not their Best CD but its defidantly worth the 7 bucks.,Well its Mike D's best album you hear him the most. I wouldn't say its a gratest hits album but it is a compilation. Overall it gets 3 stars it lacks the pizazz that Check your head boasts and of course the beats are not as futuristic as Hello nasty. Please Email me your comments
5,Supercell Rocks!,"Supercell, from Dallas Texas...one of the BEST modern rock bands! Must hear songs like ""Swept Away"" and ""Satellite"" bring bring back rock like it should be!"
3,Wonderful,"The encyclopedia is a good guide when it comes to understanding and accepting diversity from other nations plus learn new terms and it's meanings.Ron Lira, MSW"
2,LOVECRAFT...They know not what they do!!!,This is your typical slice-and-dice hokey horror film aimed at mindless teens. If you are a true Lovecraft fan you will find little more than a few familiar names (characters and books). Besides that there is nothing to attract the intellect of HPL reader.
3,Great promise but fails to deliver what the buyer expects,"This volume was a disappointment because only portions of the various speeches are used. One would expect the complete speech including the classics (American University, Inaugural etc.) Still it is fascinating to hear one of the great modern orators making his case both domestically and internationally."
2,"Funny, but not good.",The thought of this hat reminds me of Happy Gilmore's caddy. I bought it thinking that I would be able to drink beer and play video games at the same time. I was wrong. The product is completely impractical. I tried to use it one time and all that comes through the straws is foam. I haven't used it since.
4,Fun gift,"Bought as a gag gift for a grab bag. But, it was the most fought for gift there! Good enough quality for the price."
3,Gag Gift Quality,"My son wanted this for Christmas a few years ago (as a joke). I ordered it because it was cheap and he likes novelty items such as this. It is pretty cheap and flimsy, but he used it a couple of times. It is a pain to clean afterwards."
1,A Disgrace,"Stuart Little has always been a wonderful book and it would have made a wonderful movie if the producers had used the original text as a guide. Instead, they strayed so far from the original text in making the movie that they were forced to publish books like this to bridge the gap. The E.B. White text is beautifully written and has captured the imagination of children and adults for decades. Do not buy this, buy the original."
2,An interesting observation and a short review.,"First, a comment regarding the individual from Washington who feels it necessary to lash out at those readers who did not enjoy this book as much as he did: he claims that ALL of those who rated the book less than 6 call themselves ""A Reader."" Upon counting there are 12 reviews that rate the Wheel of Time series a 6 or less, and only 3 of them refer to themselves as ""A Reader."" Perhaps this says something about those who actually liked these books. I found the first three books (that was as much as I was able to endure) to be quite tedious. While there were some interesting characters and plot developments in the first book, the series continued to stretch itself far too thin and wide. Jordan loses his appeal as he tries to expand the scope of his series far beyond its strength. A disappointment."
5,It's awesome!!!,"This book is great for readers who like pure science fiction books. After taking a month to read this book, I read the next two in only two weeks!!! I am on the fourth book now. If you like J.R.R. Tolkien or David Eddings, you will love this book!!!"
3,"A good start, but the series never develops","A good book - very reminiscient of Tolkien. Be warned, there's 8+ more books to follow with no end in sight. In each book less happens. Don't start until all the books are out."
5,The BEST fantacy book out there to date!,"Robert Jordan is absolutly a genious. He has taken the familier world of Tolken and make it fresh again. He has not taken a person and put new cloths on it, he has taken a bunch of bones and put a new skin on it. If you read this book I am sure you will love it as I did."
1,"Dark, Evil, and more Dark","The book was ok,I guess, but It was way too dark. There are no uplifting aspect or morals. The story and characters were very addicting and attractive, but there are like four good guys in a world with a million bad guys. I guess if you like reading about overwhelming evil all the time, then you would like it, but for something more balanced, I would suggest you turn to other fantacy authors like Brooks, Tolkien, Mc.Kiernan, and so on."
4,An addictive read!,"The size may seem imposing on this one, but don't let that fool you. I finished it in nothing flat and asked for more. One of three boys from a small unassuming village holds great power in his hands and is the one being sought. But let me tell you, the other two aren't anything to dismiss, either! Here you will find wonderfully developed characters, a world to get lost in (thankfully there are maps!), and a storyline that will keep you interested and wanting to go on to the sequel (The Great Hunt) when you are done."
1,Fragmented,"This greatly abridged version left me very confused. I rewound and listened to parts repeatedly trying to follow the plot. Then I accidentally came across the unabridged audio book at my library and saw that it wasn't just two 1 1/2 hour tapes - it's several times longer. How could the author Robert Jordan allow such a massacre of his work? Now that I am halfway through the full unabridged version I understand and appreciate the storyline and the characters. This is rich! I'm really enjoying it. Don't cheat yourself, read the book or get the unabridged audio version."
1,Dune meets Tolkien,"Would not suggest reading this book to anyone. Especially if this is your first trip into fantasy worlds. Jordan seems to have taken the works of Frank Herbert, and JRR Tolkien, smashed them together, and mangled them... badly. The book is advertised as expanding on the world of Tolkien, but that reviewer must have been drunk when he wrote that."
1,The book is grand but the abridged audiotape is LAME.,"I was hesitant to buy this book on tape because it is abridged and read by someone other than the author. I decided to buy just the first tape and decide on buying more after listening to it. The abridgment is horrid. Important pieces, needed to help the story line flow along smoothly, are totally cut while insignificant parts remain. The reader, Mark Rolston, only made things worse. I realize that pronunciation is bound to be different, and I tried to deal with the seeming slaughter of names and places, but I could not make myself come around to his style of reading. Pronunciation aside, the reading made me ill. His false enthusiasm and halfhearted emotion was more than I could endure. I would not recommend this particular rendering of the book to anyone."
1,They don't get any less original than this.,"I have to confess I haven't yet finished this book- and I don't know if I ever will. So far, it is nothing more than a poor, hackneyed imitation of Tolkien. I mean, I don't know if I have ever read a story that so shamelessly echoes another. Not that Jordan doesn't borrow from other sources as well, because he does(Star Wars comes to mind). Unfortunately for Jordan, while he is able to borrow his ideas from other sources, he is unable to present those ideas in a convincing fashion. Few of his characters seem real. In light of this, and the fact that Jordan has followed this massive book with 7 or 8 more like it, I have to say that to me this seems to be the work of a hack. If you are thinking of reading this book and you haven't yet read 'The Hobbit' and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, do yourself a favor and read the Tolkien books instead. Written decades before 'The Eye of the World', they are none the less light years ahead of it."
1,You can pass this one safely,"I got about halfway through the book, when I just couldn't get on. Why? It is unoriginal. Gob'lin please no. Writing shows no special style. If you want to read fantasy, go get George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Or even Goodkind's Sword of Truth, brutal though it is, Goodkind at least has a gripping plot unlike this bad copy of Tolkien. If you have read any of those two authors you will be dissapointed with Jordan.I can't imagine anyone reading volume after volume of stuff like this."
1,Very good......BUT,"Basically, the book (and it's sequels) are very well written and enjoyable and I'd give it a 4 or a 5. But it's just too LONG! Enough is enough already! He should have wrapped it up after 5 books maximum. With each new volume, my interest waned to the point that I haven't bought the last few and I have no interest in what happened or will happen."
4,decent start to series,"a slow but enjoyable introduction to the series. it sometimes becomes a bit predictable and cliched, but it is a quick good read."
4,Interesting reading.,I've read it before but it's easier reading on my tablet. You'll have to read the whole series to enjoy it.
5,I love it!!,I have read the paperback and got my own kindle edition! One of the best fantasy around. I recommend it to everyone who likes epic fantasy novels that are unorthodox and brilliant.
5,the beggining......,"Rand, the son of a sheepherder in Two Rivers, lives a normal life; he has a girl, friends, and a home. But, it's all compromised when two outsiders come to Emond's Field, a Warder and an Aes Sedai. Within a night he and his friends find themselves swept in a dark cloud of legend and destiny. Can they stay in the light and find the Eye before the Dark One's grip tightens on the world..."
1,anyone hear of J.r.r. tolkien?,"Well i read this book and i am not pleased. Mr. Jordan tears apart what Tolkien created and filled it crap. Im sorry if i couldnt write a book that was at least a little original, i wouldnt write one at all. Unfortunatly Mr. Jordan has. Im sorry i cant recommend this book to anyone. Im also sorry i had to give it one star. It doesnt deserve it."
1,Light hearted fantasy adventure for the kids.,"You have to suspend your disbelief when you are reading any of the books in the Wheel of Time series. I like a good fantasy/adventure type book, but this is a bit like comedy capers when dozens of huge troll-like creatures cannot even lay a finger on a few farm boys in a battle. It's also sad to see a world completely dominated by hen-pecking women who have all of the men literally shaking in their boots. If I see the word ""bristled"" again I think I'm going to scream!"
2,A series that gets worse,"This book is a decent start to a series that gradually becomes awful. It's a series that goes on for many books, and like many readers I continued to read the increasingly tiresome and pointless sequels simply because I wanted to get to the ending since I had invested the time in the earlier books. The books have many annoying and tiresome attributes that would be bearable, but by the time you get to volume 5 of this series you will need to keep an airsick bag handy, or maybe just skim every 10th page. Telling you to stay away from this series is the kindest deed I am likely to do today..."
1,Boring at best,"I am a huge fantasy fan, and picked up this book because of a literay comparison on the back cover to Tolkien. I was eager to be swept away into a complex world only to be sorely disappointed. The story line has borrowed extensively from Tolkien and in itself is too simply written for me. The characters were not developed enough and nothing lasting or truly exciting happened at all in this book. By page 600 I was straining to keep my eyes open and praying for something to happen and was left with nothing. Jordan has thrown in references to the past ages of the Breaking of the World and alludes to historical context to place the current setting. However alludes is all he does it was like he was throwing random references in anywhere and would not elaborate to build up a good story. This book in no way is comparable at any level to Tolkien or any other great book. This book would be good for children I suppose because that is the level of the writing in this novel."
2,Not bad but I never bothered beyond this one,A kind of typical Tolkien knockoff. Better than some but worse than others. If you really dig fantasy then Jordan will probably suit you just fine. If your standards are high (and mine are) you will probably want to pass this one on. I was bored out of my skull.
1,Like watching highschoolers play D&D,"The prose is ham-fisted, the characters are cardboard cutout RPG archtypes whose dialog sounds like larpers carrying foam swords, and the pacing is awful. Skip it."
5,Fantastic book and series,Truly an adventure to read. Enjoyable through and through with compelling characters and plot. I recommend this book to almost everyone i meet.
4,"Not the Best, but Damn Good","Any book that sparks a dozen others and garners nearly 2000 reviews is obviously damn good. Would not call it great though. Great for me is more than just cool. Great for me is ideas about human existence, from a place of emotional and philosophical integrity and rigor. Still, there is nothing wrong with cool.My friend begged me to read this and the next three in the series. I liked them a lot but ultimately lost patience with the unending melodrama and unnecessary secrets of the 2 dozen key characters. Having said that, the action and adventure and magic on display here basically defined my view of what sword&sorcery; should be. The Heron Blade, the Warder, the Dark One, Lews Therin Telamon.That's as cool as it gets."
5,A MUST read,All i can say is that this is one of the best books i have read in a long time... I would compare it to the Death's Gate Cycle... but that is like comparing Fast Fry Steak (DGC) and a Sirloin Tip (WOT).. i'm only now reading the second book of the series and i can't put it down.. looking forward to the rest
2,To save you some time.,"This is a good attempt to recreate the works of Tolkien, if you want fantasy on a grand scale, do yourself a favor and read tolkien. Please don't read thousands and thousands of pages to find this out yourself. The story goes on way to long, about 8 books all 700 pages long. Just read Tolkien you will be much more pleased."
2,Not worth the hype,"I feel horrible for writing this, but it is the truth. This book, the series, is so bland, so blah! I tried reading Eye of the WOrld, I struggled for months with it. This is coming from the same person who read George RR Martin's trilogy in a week! I am a lover of High Fantasy and Epic Fantasy, but Robert Jordan's writing is the pits.This book wasn't worth the garage sale price I paid for it."
4,a master minded jordan,I think jordan really hit it big with this book. He had me interested from start to finish.
2,TOTALLY STEALING IDEAS,"This series of books is a okay read, but there is a great put-back. This series of books is nothing but a copy of J.R.R. Tolkiens LOTR and Terry Goodkind's SOT series. This book is a compilation of the ideas in these books. It seems as if The Wheel of Time is just a minimized version of LOTR and SOT combined. I mean, great chunks of the detail is simply removed. You'll see what i mean if you read these books."
1,Would you like to fall asleep?,If you need to get to bed early then I suggest to pick this book up. It is guranteed to put you right to bed with it's drab plot and droll characters. So you'll be glad when your boss gives you a raise for getting there early. Thanks Robert Jordan for giving me an alternative for counting sheep!
3,"Average Novel, Good Start to the Series","Having just started reading the series, I found this book to be average in the genre. Good vs evil, most issues black and white. . . . etc. I enjoyed reading it but wouldn't have put it on the must read again short list. It is well written, (the length doesn't bother me.) However as I am now in the third book of the series I must confess I am starting to get hooked.I think this series will be a very good summer vacation/lie on the boat/soak up some sun/read a few chapters kind of book. Series will probably get 4 stars from me when all is said and done."
5,This is quite possibly the best book ever written.,"This book ignited my interest in reading fatasy once again.I' ve always loved fantasy and this book is one of the best fantasy works to come out in a long time.The characters are cool and they make you feel for them,the story is well thought out and the land is also intricately designed.Overall I feel this book is awesome and will live on as one of the best fantasy stories ever."
4,Get through the first half to get hooked,"This saga breaks most of the stereotypes in the fantasy genre. You can't tell from the first half of book 1, though. Just get through it ... the Tolkienesque elements will go away and the characters will develop interesting personalities. It becomes a page-turner by the end. The second book is much better."
5,Excellent,"If you cannot say that this book is completely original, and that's true, you either can't say you can stop reading it. I got addicted to it. Ok, the preface it's not quite interesting. Skip it. Read it after you've read the book or read it knowing that what follows it's much better.Sometimes, however, you can notice a clear inspiration in The Lord of the Rings, and other times in Dune. Does it bother? I don't think so. Those are great books, and so it is The Eye of the World.Before finishing it, I ordered the 9 sequels of The Wheel of Time. I hope I wasn't precipitated. Hope not.Anyway, who likes The Lord of the Ring will like Jordan's book."
2,skip it,"Jordan has basically taken ideas from all the great fantasy books out there and has thrown them together. He has ""borrowed"" from Brooks, Weiss and Hickman, and of course Tolkien. There are even elements of The Dark Tower series by Stephen King in here. Also there is no reason to have over 10 books in the series, at this point it seems to be about making money rather than developing a storyline. Do yourself a favor if you are a serious reader of fantasy, skip this unoriginal series by this unoriginal author."
1,The first in a series of wearisome trudges up a sand dune,"Jordan's work is fantastic! These are the rave reviews of friends and family regarding Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. Fantastic indeed! The book is so overdone with useless detail it reminds me of a recent hike of mine up a gargantuan sand dune near the Empty Quarter: I thought I'd never get to the top. But I went on, waiting expectantly for the breathtaking panorama that would overwhelm me. However as I crested the dune what did I see? More of the same dull, labour intensive trekking ahead of me with Jordan's dunes stretched out endlessly before me. Endless because of the anticlimactic non-resolution which I'm certain is part of Mr. Jordan's marketing strategy. Well, Mr. Jordan, you can ply your wares elsewhere. I'd rather read the sales brochure for a vacuum cleaner"
5,Good...So far!,"Last December, I went to a *small* local used bookshop and was lookin' for a good fantasy novel to read. I was recommended ""The Eye of the World."" I picked it up, got bored, and stopped at chapter 3 and let it sit on my bookshelf, gathering dust. A year later (now) I picked it up again. For some reason I'm enjoying it A LOT more now and as of 12/22/05 I am on chapter 9. It is a great read so far and when I finish it, I will surely continue reading Jordan's other ""Wheel of Time"" novels."
3,I can't believe all the 10's!,"I bought this book when I saw all the 10's in the review section. To each his own, I guess. To me this book was slowww. I was raised on Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard so I'm used to more action. 800 pages of description and the story elements still weren't clear. I'll read the second book to see if it picks up, but I've read 200 page books that I've felt more involved in."
1,So Bad,"A short summary of the book: An ancient wizard who was defeated many years ago takes an interest in 2 young country bumkin boys. But don't worry--they're being helped by a wizard from a dying order and a ranger who's secretly last in a line of kings.Yes, this book is a sad, pathetic rip off of Lord of the Rings. Really, don't bother."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Why does everyone seem to think that Robert Jordan is so great? The reason(s) escapes me. While he does indeed have some skill as a wordsmith, I found the book dull. Although I tried on two seperate occasions, I never got more than 100 pages in (and it takes a lot for me not to finish a book once I've started it). If you're looking for the next Tolkien, Jordan's not it--not by a long shot. And they say that the first book is the best of the series... Don't believe the hype."
3,Anyone Read Lord of the Rings?,"The number of parallels you can make between this book and the Lord of the Rings is astounding to the point of just barely being acceptable as original literature. It seems like every third character has the personality or role of someone from the Lord of the Rings. Despite this the book is fun to read and has some originality of its own. Additionally, the saga as a whole sucks and you shouldn't start it because you won't finish unless you're masochistic. If you have to choose between this one and Lord of the Rings, choose A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin instead."
3,"Yeah, well... mediocre, merely","Robert Jordan presents several interesting concepts in his book. Rand Al'Thor is a relatively well drawn character, but i had trouble relating to him and he other characters... they just weren't very involving. All in all, there are better fantasy series to be read."
2,I Don't Like His Writing,"Ok. I just read the Game of Thrones. G RR Martin is a fantastic writer. his realism, storying telling are awesome! Unfortunately, Jordan seems like a 1st grade writer in comparison. His narrative is boring and details are abundant in areas that done matter or create any sense of a rich world. I really don't know much about the character of the protagonists and I am through the 1st novel. Seems so simple in comparison. Also, the overly complex made up names are just plain dumb. Just because it is a fantasy world with magic, etc, doesnt mean that someone can't be named Jack or Tod. How about Tim the Enchanter? .... anyway.I bought this book at the advice of a student who told me that it was ""GREAT!"" ... I should have known better for 2 reasons: the student was a doofus and I tried reading this book years ago and threw it away because I couldn't get into it.Save yourself some trouble and read something else. Sorry to be so negative, but I am hoping to spare you...."
1,Why not to brazilian costumers?!,"Why don't you sell this kindle ebook for costumers that live in Brazil?! As it is an ebook you don't even have to deliver... it hardly seems reasonable.I've bought more than a few kindle ebooks and never had a problem with that before now.Really want this book, and didn't know where else to send a complain.Thank you for your time."
2,Read War and Peace. It's shorter.,"When this book made its debut, and the wheel of time began to turn, the vision looked promising. Now, however, the series can no longer pretend to aspire to the heights of fantasy reached by Tolkien et al. This is not a great story; it is just a long one. The wheel of time continues to turn, with so many readers shackled to it, and it shows no sign of stopping. That additional observation made, I echo the comments made by the reader from Charlottesville, VA, on 2/24/99. Shakespeare, indeed! Lord, what fools these mortals be! Portia and Viola could teach the Aes Sedai a thing or two about womanly wisdom, although I must say Rand usually appears even more indecisive than Hamlet. Adieu, adieu, why cannot this writer say ""adieu""?"
5,A truly incredible tale,"An incredible introduction to a truly awesome series. Initially this book was difficult to get into, with all the ""foreign"" terms and language, but once I got into it, I haven't been able to put down any book in the series. Jordan does an adequate job in describing battle scenes, although are relatively far apart. Jordan's mastery, like Hickman/Weiss epic Death's Gate Cycle, lies in his ability to weave a tremendous story line, with multiple heroes, lots of enemies, each out for their own. The Forsaken are probably the most ingenious and intriguing anatagonists I've ever encountered. Excellent work."
4,Enjoyable...I will continue reading this series...,"I just finished reading the Eye of the World and I greatly enjoyed the ride. While I wouldn't classify it as the single best fantasy I've read (that spot is currently reserved by George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series) it was certainly among the best. The story flows well with a feeling of tension and pursuit throughout. The characters were interesting and engaging, not to mention well written. Each had a distinct personality and drive which was a plus for me, as I tend to favor character-centric story lines. The only thing that keeps me from a five star rating on this book (which I typically reserve for those books that I find near perfect) is that it lacked a certain level of grit and nail-biting type tension. Overall though, very well-written and enjoyable. I will certainly continue through this series happily."
4,Slow and steady,"I was a bit skeptical about reading this book at first especially after completed Eddings' The Belgariad series and Tolkien's LOTR series. For one, EOTW seems to be one longgg series. But I thought...what the heck, I'll give it a try. Well. for a start, it was excruciatingly detailed especially about their traveling. I had to force myself to read through all the details about the landscape etc. I could not feel for Rand or Mat. For a while, I was thinking about skipping this book. But things started picking up after the 450th page. Suddenly I found myself rooting for Rand, Mat and Perrin. Their torment. Their short-lived joy.Heck, this should make a great movie, if done right. However, I do wish Rand wouldn't blush or flush so much. Makes him so 'ninny' at times. I'll be starting 'The Great Hunt' soon. I hope he'll have matured a bit by then."
4,Good start,"I enjoy these books when I read them and am looking forward to the last one. I started with book one and recommend not getting to the prequel till after about book four. The whole basis of the story with the wheel of time is intriguing and entertaining. Jordan has a great writing method and I have been captured by it. The best part of this series is its length, 12 books, not all great but all pretty good."
1,The loveliest children's book ever!,"Robert Jordan's The Eye of the World teaches kids an important lesson about lying. In this delightful book, kiddies will giggle as a little girl learns that lying isn't good, but sometime a little white lie is okay. Jordan is the master of bedtime stories."
5,Eye of the World (Wheel of Time Series),"This begining is the best in series of any kind. I've never read a book/series so vivid, clear, and complete."
2,Overly long with some bright spots.,"On a recent vacation I wanted a hefty fantasy novel along for those long poolside evenings. I picked this book up, having resisted the series for years...... and I wasn't enchanted. The characters in this v-e-r-y long, endless, weighty, unbending doorstop of a book are very hard to like. The boys are nitwits and I resent being stuck in the heads of rather thick people who do very stupid things over-and-over. The female characters come off somewhat better--Jordan goes out of his way to show them as strong and smart, but I think he overdoes it. It would be far better to see equally interesting and ""strong"" (strong doesn't have to mean ""perfect"", you know) characters. Instead... ::sigh::I was pining for Earthsea, or Zelazny's Amber series, or, for heaven's sake, a couple of Moorcock's Elric books long before I turned the last pages of this monster. The other reviews here do not inspire confidence that this series is worth it. Go read something else (IMHO)"
2,Book was OK...characters could be more clearly laid out....,"This book was ok, but I did not like how complex the plotbecomes. Can't they just have one name per character? All in all itwas enjoyable, but the plot was a bit fanciful!!!"
5,GET OFF IT!!!,"I have noticed alot of people saying that RJ has copied alot of other peoples stories. Get off it, I can honestly say that Elements of Fantasy, tend to join together. But no 2 stories are exactly the same either. The Aes Sedie are witches, and other things like the quests are the Same. This is a great book, so why can't people get off of the similarities?"
5,great way to hook - 15 year old reader,"this book hooks you from the very first chapter. When a friend lent it to me I didn't really have an intention to read it, and then you opened it up and read a little and was totally hooked on it now I am ripping through the series one book after another. Great book, great read, perfect start to a captivating series! Two thumbs up."
4,"I liked it, I think","This serries is great. The serries starts off pretty slow and then everything starts to snowball. This first book is has a good introduction to the caracters, with the girth of the book mostly based on character building it is a great introduction to the story. You have to try to view the serries as one book other wise you may get bord. The only down fall with the serries I see is that Jordan likes to repeats him self a lot. When reading through the eye of the world I found a pargraph or two repeated verbaitum as it was two of three chapters before. And Im not talking about vital plot points eather."
1,A Dreadfully Boring Series,"Don't start reading this book unless you have pleanty of spare time to kill and nothing good to read. If you read this book, you will most likely continue reading the rest of the series. Each book is worse than its predecessor. They are all filled with endless plots and are awash with repetitive descriptions of the preceding plots."
3,Great book!......but where are the maps?!?,"I love the fact that Robert Jordan's massive series is coming to the Kindle, but why can't the publishers put a little more effort into it? I mean, everyone who has read these books know that part of the enjoyment is studying the maps to see the path all of the characters are taking. WHERE ARE THE MAPS?"
2,"EMPTY CALORIES! Read Tolkien, he says more with less.","This had a simple magic to it which I really appreciated. Yet the series is over 7,000 pages long. That is hundreds of thousands of words. Read The Lord of the Rings (LOR) instead. Its not even 2000 pages, a remarkable story, and best of all, you'll remember the beginning, end and everything between. It is a memorable work and you'll appreciate the long history developed in LOR. Should you want to read more, The Simillarion tells the early times of LOR's world."
2,DON'T read this book!!!!!,"This series will waste your time! It NEVER ends!The author continues to spew worthless crap at you after 10 books with still more to come! I have to admit that the first half of the books in the series are excellent (hence the 2 stars), but after that it all goes down the tube. Why start a series that will just dissapoint you? It is better for you to never know of Rand's world and his adventures then to have to suffer through the worthless pages of nothing that the author throws at you later.Save yourself the heartache and dissapointment. Instead try out something worth your time like George R.R. Martin's series ""a song of ice and fire"".Trust me, if you haven't started this series don't start now."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This book doesn't compare to George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. While Jordan endlessly discusses dozens of topics that have nothing to do with moving his storyline along, you, the reader are stuck hopelessly waiting for something interesting to happen. To think that there are a dozen or so more books in the series makes me cringe. Pick up a copy of Martin's series, and you will one day thank me for it. Martin's focus on character development and story puts The Wheel of Time to shame."
5,Pleasantly suprised...,"Back in '95, I reread the Tolkien trilogy and it resparked my passion for fantasy. Brooks was cool for a bit, but it didn't last...then came Jordan ...Are you kidding me? The man's got a grasp, and his world is HIS OWN! Sure, he was influenced...but name me an author who isn't, in one way or another! Anyway, before you get judgemental, read the whole series...it's impressive in scope, and nearly incomparable in detail... You wouldn't judge a football game by the 1rst quarter score,don't judge a classic by it's first chapter..."
2,Foggers,"I would be mad if I were in Iraq and someone issues me these goggles. If you look down for more than a few seconds, they fog up. Very disappointing."
4,Looks and works Good.,"I have been using the set for couple weeks now and it is a very good set for the sale price (for Thirty dollars). I wish I bought couple more to give them as gift. I didn't see any review on this item so, decided to buy 1 set for the trial. I definately recommend for the sale price."
2,Not for your first time dad and reluctant reader,"I understand that there are some women who were blessed with extremely enthusiastic partners who were consumed with reading all that they could to prepare themselves for fatherhood. Those same men actually are probably already prepared with the right attitude and behaviors that ironically this book does NOT speak to. This book is meant for those types of dads that don't know where to start (psychologically) with the prospect of daddyhood, and well - unfortunately, those are the same men who wouldn't pick up a dense text like this. But being a new mom, as well as a daughter who was mostly estranged by her mostly inadequate dad - I was curious to read it anyway. The book does not read in an engaging way to captivate a reader."
5,Brenda Lee sounds great in any language,"It's so nice to have a collection of Brenda's recordings in other languages. One of my favorites is Kansas City. I have the english version, but the versions on this CD are fun to listen to as well. Great addition to any collection. Just goes to show you how fantastic Brenda Lee really is!"
1,Half of Dizzy's recollections are fiction,"I am not alone in believing Elizabeth Sheridan's version of her romance with James Dean is very exaggerated and there are NO pictures of her and Jimmy in the book..another disappointment. Dizzy is mentioned in other James Dean biographies but their relationship was more on a platonic level, as his was with Eartha Kitt. Jimmy liked dancers and respected those with a love for the arts but his real love was Pier Angeli. I have a hard time giving all of Elizabeth's quotations credibility since there is no way anyone would choose this style of swriting without telling a fictional story. This book just didn't work for me and became hard to finish since I just can't help but think it's bogus. Do the research on JD, read ""Rebel"" and other books on JD and you'll see for yourself."
3,Meh..a bit too fictional are we?,"I had a great deal of expectations to this book and finished it within 24 hours. I have been a Dean fan for almost 10 years and have read a great deal of biographies on him. Im not going to give a resume`of what the book is about, obviously Liz Sheridans romance with James Dean. The thing that kinda lost my interest halfway through is the way Sheridan describes the romance, excuse me for not bealiving the mushy love they shared and the feely romance. Its too fictional for me, and I do bealive they shared a romance but that it was so defiant and heavy loaded with passion and love, sorry dont bealive it."
4,"Good, but could be better","Bought these to use in Afghanistan. They are great for keeping the dust out of my eyes, and there is a lot of dust here. Haven't had any issue with fogging up, but there isn't a lot of moisture here, so can't say that they will or won't do that just I haven't had that problem. They lenses are easy to change, and fit my face well. The only issue I have is that the tinted lenses are not that dark at all. They are about 60-70% as dark as my regular sunglasses which is still good enough to keep the sun out of my eyes, but would like if they were darker."
2,Not Much 'Monster' Mayhem At This 'Beach Party',"Monster Beach Party is a supposed horror-comedy, with very few moments of comedy and even less moments of horror. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that it could have been really fun if it would have had a lot of gore and maybe some t & a, you know like b-movies are supposed to. We see severed limbs strewn about on the beach in a couple of scenes, but other than that Monster Beach Party is as tame as a Julia Roberts movie."
4,Good Bass,I've never ordered an instrument online before so I was a bit nervous that it would be junk. I was happy to get it and find that it is a pretty nice guitar. The EQ isn't much but I not too worried about that anyway 'cause I got it to play acousticly. It has a really nice sound and I can't believe how loud it is even with the b string. Good Bass and is worth the money. I'm Happy with it.
2,SOMEWHAT DISSATISFIED,I EXPECTED LOUDER ACOUSTIC SOUND FROM SUCH A LARGE BODY. THE NECK WAS NOT ADJUSTED AT THE FACTORY AND THE STRINGS WERE BUZZING AGAINST THE FRETS. I WAS ABLE TO CORRECT THIS BY ADJUSTING THE TRUSS ROD IN THE NECK BUT THERE IS STILL SOME MINOR BUZZING. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE MANUFACTURER. OVERALL QUALITY IS GOOD FOR THIS PRICE RANGE.
2,What a disappointment.,Did Jack Higgins write this book? I've read about a half a dozen of his previous novels and was not disappointed until this one. He is capabable of much better.
2,A c.d from a long time ago.,"This album particularly is not one of my favorites put out by Audio Adrenaline.Sure,it has the occasional good song here and there,but,let's face it,this is basically trash.The lyrics are WAY too corny.(Ex.My God died on the cross,not at McDonalds!)See what I mean?Now,I'm a HUGE Audio Adrenaline fan,and I use their music as a witness,but I just didn't like this album.The early 90's rap,rock sound DOES not impress me.I hope you found this review helpful,and I recommend anything else by Audio adrenaline.Thanks for reading this!"
1,Heaven Forbid.,"This album is horrible. To actually call some of the compositions songs, is to take a few liberties in the first place. Take for example ""Who do you Love"", it's rampant wailing makes one long for the neighbor to start up the chainsaw just to drown it out. If you're looking for a decent Christian rock album look up The Newsboys ""Take me to your Leader"", Petra, or DC Talk."
1,"Thank God for ""Some Kind of Zombie!""","This is without a doubt Audio Adrenaline's worst CD. What's up with the sorry excuse for hip-hop on this CD? Mark Stuart is definitely not a rapper, and I'm glad he realized that and didn't try on any of the other albums. This CD is just a testimony to Audio Adrenaline's growth from this awful CD to their excellent newest CD, ""Some Kind of Zombie."" The only reason to buy this CD is if you have all of their other CD's and want to complete your collection. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,Famous color sequence is in black and white.,Even thought the Great Gabbo is supposedly restored the famous color sequence is in black and white.
4,Very practical gadget,"This is a very practical gadget to own, it makes the transfer of photos to any computer a breeze, you just connect it and it behaves in the same way as a USB memory. The only flaw in this gadget is the rubber cover,it's very loose and doesn't have a snug fit, therefore it's always open allowing dust in, that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. The very small size allows you to take the unit anywhere without any problems. The main advantage of this gadget is that you won't ever need the camera and cable to transfer photos to your computer, specially if you own several cameras that use different USB cables."
1,Good story; dire writing,"A great story made painful to read by shoddy writing. I am no author but I found Irving's repeated use ""of course"" when telling his story distracting - three times in a half page. Shame, I loved the film."
5,YES!,"I'm nowhere close to a literary critic, so I'll spare you a high-brow, snooty review discussing the conceit of this novel and its allegories and whatnot. All I can really say about this novel that might do it justice is that it is wonderful. It is a highly enjoyable read, packed to the point of collapse with bizarre characters and even more bizarre events, terribly poignant passages and a joy for the unexpected. It was written in 1978, but it hasn't aged a day: it could have been written just last week and it would still be great. By all means give it a shot, you will not regret it. A definite favorite."
3,"OK, but...","After reading The Cider House Rules, I was delighted to find another John Irving book in my basement. Because The Cider House Rules is such a fabulous book, I was sure this would be too.Well, I was wrong. Sure, I'll admit that there are some good parts, but The World According to Garp seems mostly like John Irving wanting to make horrible things happen to every character. There is so much violence and death that it takes away from everything else. Yes, I know that life isn't all good, but it's sort of distracting to have someone dying in every chapter. The best part of the book, in my opinion, is Garp's story ""The World According to Bensenhaver."" This book leaves you with a weird, sort of freaked-out feeling."
5,All time favourite.,I read this novel thirty years ago; loved it. Now I needed to read it again. I expect to fall in love with it all over again.
4,Unforgettable!,"Irving has created characters and plot twists that are so crazy, you have to believe them! From the moment of his unconventional conception, Garp's life is full of unusual events and characters. Through it all he maintains a zest for life and embraces it wholeheartedly, along with a strong love for his family."
4,this book is one of my favorites!,"i have lots of mixed emotions while i was reading this book which is what i usually look for in a book... the bizarre characters and even more bizarre events would all make you laugh, mad, fall in love and cry... it's like reading 2 stories in one book--garp's and his mother's... a real page turner... give it a shot!"
1,More Learning C then Learning about programming PIC,"The title of the book is misleading. I was expecting to learn about programming the PIC using CCS C but 8 of the 9 chapters dealt with learning C and had nothing to do with the PIC. The one chapter the did deal with the PIC was short and did not give a lot of information or examples. To me, this book is not worth the money. But if you're looking for a beginners guide to C with a brief description of some of the commands used to program the PIC using CCS compiler, then it may be worth a look."
1,My Review,"A fairly straight forward book for the beginner. Takes some of the mystery out of using the CCS functions. If you are interested in doing some basic programming and learning some C and are new to PICs then I would suggest it. Probably not for the intermediate or advanced user. For the price, not a waste of money."
5,Worth buying,I am very lucky that this set exists as I have never read Sin City before. To read it in this glossy oversized edition has been a treat. It is totally worth the money - I purchased it on Amazon in 2007 and notice the price has only gone up for the used sets - and looks really nice on the shelf. My only regret is that I bought too many paperback copies of other graphic novels - slowly they are coming out with archival editions and I have to begin the expensive process of replacing my old copies with these new cooler editions!
1,White Buffalo,"It's A DVD-R, not a real DVD, don't waste your money buying it. Record it off TV unto a DVD-R and you'll have a better copy. The studios are ripping people off charging this kind of money for something that is not restored and not even a real DVD. They're are rip-off artists."
2,What a waste of talent.,"I had read many bad reviews of this movie before I watched it, and often that can actually mean it's really a good film. -But no, not in this case, I'm afraid. I'm a big Bronson fan, but I was very disappointed by it. Charlie seems to be sleepwalking through this one. Lots of fast cuts, and pointless cameos only add to the confusion in this messy movie. J. Lee Thompson is just not a very good director. The script, and the story is also nothing special. On the plus side; I didn't find the buffalo itself as badly constructed as often claimed, and the scenes with it were o.k. The whole thing probably seemed like a good idea at the time, but the end-result shows something quite different."
3,"Great Movie, done on the cheap by MGM.","First, I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD, I think its among Charles Bronson best. A fictional team-up of Wild Bill Hickok, and Crazy Horse. But this review is about the poorly done DVD let me go point by point:Picture: Good, I watched the movie on a blue-ray player with a HDMI hookup. The quality of the non-blue ray movie was good, an excellent transfer, that kept with the dark mood of the picture. However, its fullscreen only, in a movie that would've benefited from widescreen.Extras: None...zip....nothing...no trailer, no setup, no menu, NOTHING! Even if the trailer been lost, there is so much history, documentaries, film on Hickok, Crazy Horse, the west, even on the Bozeman trail. Another good extra would've been about western slang, which the film is filled with. But there's nothing.Box: Nothing special, even the back had minimal text.And there's nothing else, when MGM called it a Limited Edition, they really meant limited on content."
2,Reamer is dull and overly large tips are hard to insert,"I got a couple of these to put in my cars, because I think that plugging a tire on the car is usually a better choice than using the compact spare. I've used the kit twice, for a lawn mower and a motorcycle tire.Having plugged a lot of tires over the years with a variety of tools I will note that this particular kit is difficult to use because the tips are oversized and lack precision (they're dull). That means that a great deal of force is necessary to insert them, even when lubricating the tips with cement. That is particularly true on steel belted tires, and on high ply count tires. The plastic handle is not particularly strong and will not withstand the gorilla-like forces necessary in some cases."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF ACTUAL PRODUCT,"***PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THE PICTURE SEEN ABOVE IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT!***I just purchased this kit and received it from Amazon. The Slime 22038 product being shipped ONLY comes with the following:7-Piece's: (3)-Repair Plugs, (1)-Glue, (1)-Reamer Attachment, (1)-Plugger Attachment, & (1)-T-Handle with Built-In StorageThe pictures Amazon is using to describe this product are for the OLD 'Deluxe Reamer Plugger with Storage Handle - #22038'Slime has since replaced that product with the now 'Compact Tire Plug Kit - #22038'I checked Slime's website for this product: [...]If you check Slime's website, you can see the product picture has been updated to represent the new product (you're welcome ;P), however, the old description still exists.This is nothing more than blatant false advertisement by both Amazon and Slime! Please be aware of what you will actually receive is you order this product!"
3,Wow..This is a dark movie...,There is some great acting & scenes in this movie but it is a very dark story!!!Brendon Fletcher really has a good part in this movie...!If you like dark storys it's a great movie..!
1,This Movie sucks,"Now your problay wondering why i put 1 star on theirand the put ""THIS MOVIE SUCKS"".Well that's becauseit has only 1 good scene in their that's when that kidwith the spikey red hair gets his revenge on the pedofilesecurity guard.This movie really has no plot,no storythey really don't tell what are the story behind these5 troubled teenagers.And i think whoever made this movieneeds to go back to college because he has no idea how to makea film in my opinon.And i would only reccomend this movieto (...),lesbians,pedofiles,troubled teens,adultsor canadians"
2,"Initially I liked it, but...","Initially this seemed like a great product. I loved the fact that the bassinet came with a separate stand so that I could move it around the house. We left the changing table set up in our bedroom so that we could use it for nighttime changes and it worked great. However, our baby outgrew the bassinet by 7 weeks and the material on both the bassinet and the play yard has already started to fray. It's especially disappointing that the play yard is fraying since we haven't moved it since we set it up the first time. I would not recommend this product."
2,Very disappointed,I returned this product - it was hard to assemble and very flimsy. I bought this largely for the bassinet feature and to have a travel bed. The bassinet was so flimsy I would not put my new baby in it. The playard was very heavy and hard to set-up/ fold down. did not meet any of my needs
3,"Pretty, but frustrating","I love the way this play yard looks. I have it in the lime green and it really is sporty.Pros: Looks good, very sturdy, light & vibrate features are great, conveneint changing table and bassinet featuresCons: You HAVE to follow the directions. There is only 1 order to set the pnp up (and 1 way to take it down). I actually wrote in marker on mine to remind me because it is easy to forget and I was tired of getting the directions everytime I set it up/took it down. The directions for assembling the bassinet are very unclear...just look at the pictures and trial and error will set it up! The music is loud and funky and once you turn it on, there isn't an off until the song is over, so if you hit the wrong button in the middle of the night, you may wake up a sleeping baby. The pnp and the bassinet are odd sizes, so there are NO sheets available to purchase for them. I made my own.I would not recommend this product. I'm sure there are better pnp's."
5,Funniest hat ever.,"Purchased for my husband's Father's Day, I received the hat today in the mail and can't stop laughing. The hat I received was precisely as depicted, and excellent quality. I can't wait to give it to him!"
5,Awesome hat!,Mine came with the lightening bolt and was awesome! If yours didn't why not contact the manufacturer?
2,Item not as shown,"We received the hat in great time, however there was nothing on the back of the hat like the picture had shown. Nephew loved the hat, but I am sure it would have been better received if it had the fish with lightening bolt on the back of the hat."
3,Tennille's swing attempt sumptious,"Toni Tennille's voice has always been a unique instrument since her early recording days, and here's she's put its raw, hard edge and throaty instincts to good use with some Big Band selections. She excels at many tracks, and other are merely passable, but on the whole, it's a good outing for her. Nice touches are ""Things are Swinging,"" a Peggy Lee-penned piece and ""This Can't be Love"". Misfires include ""Beautiful Baby"" and ""Bowl of Cherries."""
1,Tennille Sings Big Band,"I love Tennile but was very disappointed with this CD as I wanted her songs on my ITunes (Apple Computer). For my ITunes, the CD did not list the titles of the songs that were on the CD. I have no way of knowing which track is a particular song."
3,"A vast improvement over the MATLAB documentation, but....","This book may be the best there is to offer as a general reference book on MATLAB 5. But it is way over-priced, and the buyer should be aware that it is actually 100 pages shorter than it is described in the publisher's blurb. The index fairly weak--only 7 pages; compare that to the 80+-page index in Wolfram's _The Mathematica Book_ to see how complete a reference book's index _should_ be."
1,Not that great,"The fact that this book is unedited doesn't bother me. This book contains interesting info on the formation of the various branches of the Hungarian army during the inter war years. The info from World War Two appears to consist of translated war diaries, with little or no analysis of the larger picture on the eastern front. I would pass on this one. In this book's favor is the fact that you won't find this info anywhere else. If you have to have it, try for the cheap copy"
4,Bioaire F250 filter,I'm been using this air filter for quite a while- low cost and effective to reduce allergens in the house-my 2 kids has allergic rhinitis!
3,Read it with my son,Interesting perspectives offered here. Not the most spectacular writing but the book gave me things to think about. Bought it used.
2,Philosophy for dummies,"While this is a fun, easy read, it falls short of the dazzling reviews often bestowed upon it.This is a great book for anyone who has never had a basic thought about the nature of the universe and the divine in their lives. Perhaps this would be a lovely book to read early in adolescence when such questions really begin to poke at one's mind.However, for anyone who has read anything even approaching philosophy or has ever done any serious soul searching, this book is probably far below you.I kept turning pages hoping for some novel, surprising, or, at the very least, interesting insights that would allow the book to be deserving of the lauds it has received. Unfortunately, from cover to cover this book makes no conclusions worthy of such praise.My advice: Skip it and find a more sophisticated, or at least, engaging read."
5,What story could be more relevant to our times now?,"(Actually deserves 6 stars ******)I'll make this short and sweet, reading _Ishmael_ by Daniel Quinn is like opening your eyes for the first time. So much controversy, so little pages, you'll want more and more to learn and discover about our flawed society. No other book is more relevant nor important to the times that befall us. Deeply touching and intriguing. READ!"
2,Disapointed.,"The book isn't bad at all and I get what he is saying but the problem is that I read all the reviews before I bought the book. I was searching for something to help me make sense of life and the world and I just knew that this was it. I am even a huge Pearl Jam fan and they love the book. I purchased it and read it in one day and when it was over I said, ""that's it?"" So beware if you are truly searching for answers. Like I said the book isn't bad and the author makes some points but never has a book fallen so short of its hype."
4,Another way of looking,"An interesting book isn't known by the answers it gives, it's by the questions it raises. And in this book Quinn certainly asks a very interesting one. What is the law of LIFE? All living creatures should live by this law to stay alive. Those who don't are doomed to extinct.Untill there the book is worth 5 stars, but after that question it goes down to 3. Quinn looks for the answer in the field of anthropology, which is a far to narrow field. It's about human life, not LIFE. The answer should be found in a science which investigates something that all living creatures have in commen. All forms of complex life have one small thing in commen. If you find the law by which that smal thing lives, then you have the law for any form of complex life. (This should be a big hint for the science I'm talking about)When you find that law, read this book and see how nice the answers of anthropology fit in."
1,A poor attempt at The Celestine Prophecy,"This book has to be one of the worst that I have read in a long time. The story is implausible, the characters are unbelievable, and the message is too hidden, not to mention too convoluted. A winding story that weakly tries to give its reader the same sort of feelings of destiny and purpose that Redfield's ""THE CELESTINE PROPHECY"" instilled in all of its readers. Not only did I feel that this book was a waste of time, but of paper, that it's Taker vs Leaver mentality is souly against. I gained nothing from this book, and found myself only confused and bored from the lack of any sort of involving plot line. If you are seeking enlightenment, look somewhere else."
2,High Expectations =>=> So-so Message,"I consider myself an open-mined, reasonably enlightened person. I read this book on the recommendation of a good friend, whose prior suggestions I've enjoyed greatly. So, my expectations were fairly high before reading the book. Unfortunately, I felt a sense of disappointment after reading it. While at times interesting, my overall impression is a mix of ""duh""and ""this is old hat"". Like some of the other reviewers, I felt that the author's generalizations detracted from the integrity of the message he was trying to convey. I wouldn't put this one at the top of your list. Nor would I say that it had a significant impact on my life (although several other books have)."
1,Invest your hard-earned book money elsewhere,"A novel idea, but lacks ""what can I do about it"" clout. Too much repetition, and nothing more than a new age, reflective diatribe (one man's opinion of humankind's assault on nature and the animal kingdom. Do yourself a favor and invest in material that gives hard core answers. I was told this would be a life-changing read. Indeed, it is not!"
3,A good book?,"I would like ""xodarap7"" to suggest us a good book. A novel that's inspiring and intelligent."
1,Trash for pseudo-intellectual children,"This book is the WORST. There's nothing wrong with earnest idealism, Socratic dialogues, intellectual journeys, talking gorillas, mythology deconstruction, or ecological-mindedness. Taken together, however, and done by Daniel Quinn? If you like this book you are either a monster or a freshman. Go read Steve Healey's ""How I Became a Famous Novelist"" instead. Namaste!"
1,"Not bad. . . Not GOOD, but not bad. . .","My views on this book may seem a bit jaded, but to be honest I'm just getting tired of hearing how ""bad"" humans are. I'm proactive when it comes to the ecology, but this book makes it clear that the only thing humans can do to improve this world is go away. Sorry Dan, not gonna' happen."
1,Too many people don't read this book with a critical mind,"This book has a lot of ideas that sound great, but in the harsh ligh of critical thinking don't really pan out.While reading the book, I kept thinking ""yes, but..."" and""didn't you think about..."". It's too easy to say things like""treat the earth well"", or ""treat your fellow man well"" - but howin the world could you get from our current society to the oneyou'd have if you followed the strictures in the book. Ok, maybethis book just meant to be thought provoking, but it would havebeen so much more interesting if actually tried to provide someideas how to achive the goals it set forth - even if it didn'teven pretend they were serious, they'd be more thought provokingthan this book actually is. Witness all the dazed cows hypnotizedby this book's chant of ""harmony""."
2,Oh God,"Oh. My. God. This book was mindnumbingly stupid. I felt like I was reading my environmental science textbook. This book does not make you ""rethink your entire existance,"" it makes you roll your eyes every 8 seconds. This book would only appeal to someone who needs someone else to think for them (which, in fact, the narrator does). He [the narrator] wants a ""teacher for life,"" and just reiterates everything that Ishmael says the entire book! My God, think for yourself! This is obviously a thinly masked novel about the author's beliefs. Stay away!"
5,One of my top ten.,"This book is one of my favorites. I tried a few others by Quinn and also really enjoyed ""Beyond Civilization"" a more straight forward approach. I highly recommend both and have probably now given away 7 copies of Ishmael. I just can't keep this to myself. ""Teach a hundred what I've taught you, and inspire each of them to teach a hundred."""
4,Gets you thinking.,This book got me into reading after a long time without books. Has a lot of information that'll make you think about life and religion. I recommend to people who are open to ideas about the world and how it was created and how it should be appreciated.
4,thought provoking and unique,"Ishmael raises some interesting points, some I'd never thought of before reading the book. The writing isn't the best out there but I still think this is a very important book in terms of the human race and the world. I've always known that there was obviously something wrong with the way we as humans were living but now I can see what exactly it is and where the roots of the problems are. I understand the issues and even how they can be resolved thanks to Daniel Quinn. Ishmael tries to show us a new way to live that we're not used to but if we can manage to live as he recommends the world will be much better off."
4,"not a masterpiece, but a good book nonetheless","I enjoyed this book, and I believe everyone should read it. I do not, however, believe it to be a masterpiece or anything of the sort; it has not changed my life. What this book has done, and what any good book should do, is make me see things in a slightly different way than I saw them before. Quinn makes some very compelling and intellectually engaging arguments. These arguments (in my humble opinion) greatly overshadow the fact that Ishmael is a gorrilla that can communicate using only his mind, as well as the other fantastic aspects of the book. These unbelievable parts of the story should not stop anyone from reaping all the benefits of this book. If an open mind is kept, I believe that one cannot help but have one's perspective changed a little after reading Ishmael."
1,My Rocommendation-Don't Read This Book,Reading this book was not fun at all. The book talks about nothing and I would never reccomend this book to anyone. This put me to sleep everytime i picked it up. I just wanted the book to end. And I was hapy when the book was all over. I had to read this book for a class I taking otherwise I would have never even picked it up after the first chapter. The only way I would reccomend this book is if it was for something so you could get to sleep at night. This book taught me one thing- how boring a book can be. I would rather sit in the corner of the room and have to stare at the wall for hours instead of reading this book. I don't recommend you to read this book and I am sorry for those of you who have to sit through it for any class.
1,An insult to intelligence!,"This book is not all bad. There are brief passages that are even remotely original. However, the majority of this novel is uncomfortably shallow and lacking any real Truth or Beauty. And contrary to some other reviews, I never felt challenged by Quinn to reexamine my thoughts or actions. For something better, try Tom Robbins, Wim Coleman, Mark Leyner, or Derrick Jensen (listed with first being best).DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK until you have read a passage from it or at least skimmed the first few dialogue shifts.And remember, no matter how eloquent somebody may sound -- this all really just comes down to personal opinion."
5,Eye opening,"This book contains many original ideas. It tells the story of the history of humanity and separates out the myth that the Fertile Crescent was where history began and all else was prehistory. It tracks the destructive `Taker' culture from the Fertile Crescent and describes the basis for the destruction of indigenous `Leaver' cultures, by outlining the primary story that these two people live by. A must read for anyone who is interested in understanding the environmental disaster that our culture is having on the biosphere."
5,"Important, if not beautifully crafted","This is the story of a gorilla who teaches us how to save the world. It's an extremely important text for understanding how the stories we create in our culture allow us to rationalize our ecologically destructive way of life. Ishmael says that according to our ""Taker"" way of looking at the world, the world was created for us, and accordingly, we can (and should) do with it as we please. Quinn very convincingly tells us how this logic is flawed, and he offers an optimistic view of how we can reverse this trend. Although the novel, such as it is, offers little in the way of plot, setting, or character development, and although it waxes self-righteous and smug, the message is an essential one, one that must be heard. It is true that our culture is on a self-destructive path, and Ishmael offers us a new path to follow. Follow the baboon, I say!"
2,Boring and Repetitive,"The book endlessly repeats its theme, so much so that it marginalizes its subject. It's a story that can be told once and then elaborated on with supporting detail, which seems to have escaped Mr. Quinn"
1,And if Quinn armwrestled Ishmael...?,"Okay, truth be told, Daniel Quinn has some interesting points. Nothing too groundbreaking if you have any common sense and an anthropology/history class or two. But does he really have to be so damned preachy?I had some hopes for this book before I started reading it. It was highly recommended by someone I respected, so I gave it a chance. Even after the same damned message was beat into my head page after page. Man is the problem, dating back to when we dropped out of the trees and first made fire. Whatever. Mr. Quinn, if we stayed hunter-gatherers, would you have ever had a chance to write your little books? You would have been dead by age 20. Your cavalier attitude makes me drop to my knees and thank God for technology."
3,Review of Ishmael,"Ishmael was a new, interesting, yet somewhat uneventful book that I recently read. It is about a man who seeks a tutor, and then finds one in a talking ape named Ishmael. While this all may seem juvenile, the man actually has thought-provoking discussions with the ape about how man has doomed himself by creating agriculture and civilization. The point Ishmael is trying to make is that man needs to go back to his hunter gatherer ways to save humanity and the rest of the world... I thought Quinn's book was interesting, but don't let the book get to your head."
2,"Interesting and fun for 90 pages, then gets cynical and repetitive","Basically, some good points early in the book concerning the need to be in harmony with our environment. He uses an interesting and fun teacher/student relationship with a wise but droll and lonely gorilla as a teacher. Be aware that the book becomes cynical and ends up making most of us humans to be misguided at best and evil at worst. It is the same old glorification of nature and demonizing of humanity, though there is certainly some truth to this in the way we treat our environment. But, if that is your point of view this book will be a fun read."
5,A capturing read,"I am not a 'reader' so when I stumbled across this book (cant actually remember how it happened?)I wasnt really searching for a book to read. However, somehow I found myself reading the preview and just could not stop reading! I downloaded the full kindle version and read it front to back in a few days. That is saying something for someone like me! A unique story with an insightful perspective on a fundamental of life. For those of us who are always questioning why our world is like it is....this is well worth a read. I am now on to Daniel's 2nd book ""The Story of B"". :-)"
4,interesting format,easy read. gave me a good different angle to consider history and future history. Glad I picked it up finally. I'd definitely recommend the book.
5,Excellent Book,"Great book, I would recommend to anyone that likes to think outside the box. Daniel Quinn does an excellent job explaining some of today's hardest issues in a simple and believable manner."
1,Impossible to enjoy,"This book is a kind of slow, viral torture designed to bury itself in the brainstems of those who truely believe the handful of valid points the author's gorilla pounds into us over and over and over again.Not only is this book is bad sociology, it is just plain bad writing. If you liked this book, you've been manipulated."
1,Great Book for self-loathing Caucasians,Do you believe Western Civilization is the root of all evil? Do you believe Human beings are nothing but a virus on the face of Mother Earth? Do you hate Caucasians or wish you weren't one?Do you believe that the world would be a better place without people?Then this book is for you!
1,A Good Book For Those Without Religion,"In short, this book goes on and on and ON about everything that I have learned immoral in my life. The people who love this book tend to have an open mind about our creation."
3,Wonderful example of how to beat a dead horse...,"Ishmeal, by Daniel Quinn, is a descent book in that it conveys a positive idea. It promotes cooperation and awareness and I think is meant to enlighten the public. However, the author underestimates his audience's intelligence and tends to regergitate his thoughts with each turning page. It is very slow reading and uneventful. If you've ever wondered how many ways one can convey the same (and not a very original) ponderance, please read this book..you may not find it to be a tedious and condescending as I had."
4,"With Ishmael as a teacher, will there be hope for man?","Ishmael was truly an adventure for the mind. After reading the book, not only did I have a new view of life ahead of me, but the past also had a different light on it. After completing the book, I suddenly understood everything I had wondered about before. The book provides what could be called ""enlightenment.""Ishmael is a book with no equal."
3,ok but not as good as I expected,Seems to work ok. But 4 batteries installed and I expected a much brighter light. Ok it works fine and seems durable. Its really long and thin which some people may not like
2,"Okay for the price, but significantly outdated technology","Positives:* built like a tank* reliable* Well designed switchNegatives:* extremely poor beam quality (full of holes and rings, yellow-brown beam color)* old technology (doesn't use a Luxeon star LED bulb)* Very little usable sidespillOverall: For a $20'ish light, its fine for the average person that is satisfied with a mediocre flashlight. However, the excessively poor beam quality (yellow beam that turns brown as the batteries dim, plus rings and holes in the beam) and mediocre sidespill really take lots away from this outdated flashlight."
3,"Very solid design, but could be brighter","I agree with everything that the other reviewers said-this is a very well built flashlight, a great value, and able to shrug off outrageous abuse. So why have I only given it three stars? In my opinion, such a hefty light should be considerably brighter. The 2-D cell version is of moderate brightness at best and the larger versions are not much better."
4,Works like a flashlight.,"I'm a little over these big maglites. Cool at first but it gets old. Make sure to not store it with batteries in it. If you simply must have one it's a pretty imposing looking light. Impractical for almost every purpose, though."
4,Mag Lite,Sturdy product like I expected. Light was not at bright as I thought it would be but still very good
3,6 d-cell flashlight,Does not produce the narrow-focused beam as described. It does light up the night. As a weapon - excellent!
5,Great Maglite,"Its a Maglite, Quality all around, Good build, excellent light beam. Works great for my needs me. Couldn't ask for more."
4,Good Flashlight,"The flashlight is heavy duty. It uses 4 batteries, so it is good to have a charger. It is a very solid flashlight."
1,Mag does not compare with others...,"Maglite sold great flashlights many years ago. They haven't really changed their lights much over the years, and they are falling behind. There are much better, smaller, and brighter lights on the market for reasonable prices. Why lug around three huge and heavy D cells?Maglite has been suing smaller companies for unreasonable reasons. They sue smaller companies for silly little things. Do you want to buy from a huge company that crushes the other little guys? I sure don't want to.I think that if you want a good flashlight you should look at Surefire, Streamlight, Scorpion, and other companys."
1,Needs quality control,Light wont stay on . After filing and sanding all contact areas it improved a little . I still have to bang it to stay on . very disapointed . Flashlights from a Dollar Store are better .
3,Works but bifficult to install,"Needs better installation instructions especially on the 120v circut side of things, it was hit or miss with customer support on how to wire the product up. diagrams would be nice as well as trained tech support"
4,Thought provoking introspection,This book is for those who believe that the unexamined life is not worth living. The daily reflections ask those who read them to reflect on their lifes' meaning and their values.
2,No instruction!,I am an avid exerciser and am always up for a challenge however I was very disappointed with this DVD. Tracy Anderson looks like she is too concerned about how she looks while doing the moves which is annoying and she never ever gives full instructions! I don't recommend this video at all I would say go with Jillian Michael's now she is a real trainer! (Sorry Tracy for the harsh criticism but don't quit your day job whatever that may be.)
3,Okay but nothing compared to the original,Not much to say but this anime could've been longer and the characters seemed bland at times. I recommend seeing the original ova instead.
5,straightforward action with a dash of romance,"If you like your anime gripping but easy to comprehend, enjoy characterswith purpose and definition and have a taste for technically accurate (ifslightly over-the-top) aerial combat, Area 88 is the show for you.It might be a bit brief and get a tad maudlin in places, but it will keepyou entertained from beginning to end, with all questions answered and allplot threads neatly wrapped up."
2,two tries--neither one ever shuts off...possible fire hazard,"two strikes....i really wanted to like this little cooker but Panasonic seems to have quality control problems.I suppose its possible that they came from a bad production run, but I give up with Panasonic."
2,Disappointed in quality and content.,"The quality of the film is very poor. Pictures are grainey and out of focus in much of the film. Mr. Steinkraus is minimal in this film as he is shown only as narrator in a short segment. Had I known this is strictly an ammature video I would have saved my money. Thrilling? At best it is interesting. If you are really into this sport, it has little to show you. If you are interested in Olympic competition, save your money and buy an Equestrian Olympic DVD. This DVD is definately not worth the price and I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,One of the best ever,"The Office is, plainly, the funniest comedy on television today. When put up against the all-time greats, it holds its ground vs. even a heavy-hitter like Seinfeld. This set is a great deal, you know you want it, and don't try to make the argument that you will wait for the 'Seasons 1-5' collection next year. Don't put off hilarity until tomorrow.Buy this now! Great set, great packaging, great series."
1,look elsewhere,The cooler looks good but not worth the money. The sound system is very - very poor; I do not recomendI am happy to sell the one that I purchased for $20.
3,Fits Philips Go Gear MP3 player,"I paid a total of like $5 for this thing. Seriously can't complain about that. Plus Its hard to find an armband for something other than an Ipod or Zune.I have a Philips Go Gear Aria 16G and it fit it just fine. The straps are a little bulky for the punch but, come on $5!"
3,Career in the Toy Industry.,"This is a book for kids. It is 55 pages, with big font, and big pictures. If you are an adult, look elsewhere, but this would be a great book for a kid."
5,A basic insight into Vietnamese culture and thinking,"I bought my first copy of FIRE IN THE LAKE from a used book seller on the streets of Saigon in 1974. It was and is the finest look in to the workings of the Vietnamese mind available in the english language.A must read for anyone who has any plans to deal with Vietnamese before they do so.Even after seven years in the country working at the grass roots level and a Vietnamese wife, I still learned something from this book.I still reread it often."
5,Fantastic!,"My cat was extremely ill and I had to give him 7 pills a day. He's a big kitty--about 20 lbs--and was really fighting me, or taking the pill and then spitting it out. I came across these while searching for something else and decided to try them. Wow! What a difference. As soon as he heard me open the bag he came running to get his ""treat."" This has got to be one of the best ideas I've ever seen. I highly recommend these."
5,Pill pockets are a dream come true!,My vet told me I had to give my cat anti-biotics for 21 days! I felt crazy at this thought. My calico hates it when I try to shove a pill down her throat. I tried using the pill injectors but still it was high truama for my cat. Then I discovered pill pockets. They are a drean come true for me as my cat LOVES them and doesn't noticew that there's a pill inside. She just very happily gobbles it up and wants more! I was almost sorry that I was through giving her the pills but now I use them are treats and rewards just as they are.
5,Looks great.,Good price good product. When it comes to paint brushes it's hard to find good ones that don't fall apart and aren't built well. This is a great paintbrush for the price.
3,"Fair, but better collection desired.","This is a collection of music videos from Jefferson Starship/Starship in the 1980s. Music videos include We Built This City (1985), Find Your Way Back (1981), Layin' It On the Line (1984), Sara (1985), No Way Out (1984), and It's Not Over Till It's Over (1987). All are typical glossy 80's videos that are now just guilty pleasures for anyone interested in anything Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship/Starship. However, where is the music video for their #1 world-wide single Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now (1987)? How about the video for Winds of Change (1982)? Bottom line, you can't have a collection of Starship's music videos without including their best one -- Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now. By the way, Grace Slick should have taken leads on more singles. GRACE ROCKS!"
2,Pretty cheesy,"I expected real beaches, not a computer generated cartoony beach. The sound effect of waves will assist in a good nap but you wouldn't want to put this on to actually watch or as a background. Big disappointment, although it was cheap so I can't complain a lot."
1,Boring,"i have read all the Dorothy Sayers mysteries. Some are about average - Clouds of Witness for example. This is dreadful. About twenty pages of story dragged out to nearly 400 pages. Badly written, poor characterisation. Not worth picking up from the library."
1,Step back from the prozac,"This movie is completely unwatchable. Well, nearly unwatchable. As a comedy, it is hysterical, as a drama, it is painful to watch. After watching this, I longed for the days of Ishtar again, and went out and rented Gigli to cleanse my visual palate.please avoid at all costs."
4,Very Good Sci-Fi...,"I'm sorry to burst another reviewer's bubble, but as a Conservative/Libertarian I enjoyed this movie immensely.The Democratic Party of today bares little to no resemblence to the party of the time of JFK.I enjoyed this movie, and liked the idea that had JFK lived we would have colonized the Moon and beyond.Also, how could avoiding Viet-Nam be a bad thing?And Martin Luther King as Vice President of the U.S.A. is a bold move and welcome outcome of preventing the assasination of the President.For those who are fans of Time Travel, and What-ifs. I highly recommend this movie. It's fun, it's not complicated, it tells a compelling story."
3,JFK,It was an interesting twist on things. The actor portraying Dan Rather however sounded rather chppy and did a bad job on his acting. A lot of it was art. It had certain twists with it too.
3,Not Just Another Time Travel Movie,"I've loved time travel films for some time now, but this one has one of the neatest twists I've ever seen. I remember being in kindergarten when JFK was shot and a neighbor calling our house with the news. While not being exactly a Kennedy aficionado over the years, I found this film a fascinating what-if scenario. Space travel, Vietnam, J. Edgar Hoover, and even the CIA take on entire new meanings. The acting is well done, not overly melodramatic. I think they could have made it a PG-13,though, leaving out the Marilyn Monroe scenes. More people would have watched it. Very creative!"
3,Good price for the TV,"I recently purchased this Tv, but returned due to its size. The price and value is great for this Tv, but if you're looking for a large screen, this isn't it. I went from a regular 27 inch TV to this LCD one. The only problem was because it's a widescreen, you ""lose"" the screen height. It looked just too tiny, especially height wise from what we were used to. Every electronic store I checked with to compare sizes say that Sharp is at the top of the scale when it comes to the LCD Tv's. Th eonly problem was the size of the screen. We returned the Sharp for a 37 inch LG which is great too. A 37 inch Sharp is just way too much more than what I wanted to spend. Great TV if the size doesn't matter to you."
1,Do not purchase this TV,"Likewise, the sound went out just after 1 year warranty was up. then the video followed. 500.00 to fix. Has been sitting and collecting dust ever since."
2,Sound went out also,This set was great up until this week and suddenly the sound went out. My second Sharp TV set to have problems this week. Guess I angered the Sharp Gods.
1,"after 2 months = no result ,at all","after 2 months = no result ,at all grape seed oil works better and cost 100 times less"
2,Not convinced.,This stuff feels like and smells like you're rubbing crushed up Flintstones chewable vitamins on your face.
1,Didn't work for me,"I have always had great skin, hardly ever any breakouts or blemishes. When I was 28, I became pregnant with my first child and suddenly I was like a 13 year old going through puberty. My skin was horribly broken out throughout my entire pregnancy. A few weeks after my daughter was born, I stopped getting new breakouts but I was left with terrible acne scars all over my face. I bought this product and used it twice a week for 4 or 5 months. There has been absolutely no change in my skin, I still have terrible scars. For me, this did not work at all."
5,Love it!,This is a great product--leaves your skin feeling great and is not too rough on sensitive skin.
1,Manipulative crap,"Even if it is ""the story of a true haunting,"" this is a fairly sick book. The author is obviously relishing the necrophilia theme, and sensationalizes it ludicrously. Worse is the book's obvious ""Christian"" agenda, which might be summarized, ""DON'T listen to that evil heavy metal music, DO keep bibles beside your bed, and whatever you do, DON'T touch an Ouija board!"""
1,Plotless,"Yes, it's a somewhat interesting concept, but I have no idea why this book got such wonderful attention from the critics. Probably because it's a woman chronicling her barely-relationships with men, and boy, don't we love to hear about that? This isn't a novel so much as it is 'rosenfeld spills about her experiences with men' -- at least, that's what it feels like. No plot, nothing coherent. Pick up 'bridget jones' or one of the other recommendations instead."
4,Welcome to the Dollhouse,"A ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" or ""Heathers"" sort of novel that guides us through the the dating life of Phoebe Fine. From her sexual discovery years through to her diverse forms of promiscuity, she tests the boundaries of her conscience. The author writes with a dark wit that allows us to feel her experiences as if they were our own while also allowing us to laugh at the fact they we may have already felt, done, and thought similar things."
4,Ahh . . . the memories!,"What She Saw ... is a fun read that is light and humorous. Although some of the stories can go on a little too long, the majority of the book is filled with quirky anecdotes that all females can relate to starting with the fifth grade ""coolkid"" and working towards adulthood. Following the narrator as she tries to find meaning behind her unsuccessful love affairs reminds us of the neroses shared by women everywhere!"
2,pain in the neck,"I love the look and the function of this carrier but it hurts my neck and back. If you are in shape and muscular on top this would work great for you but if your idea of working out is chasing kids around and are carrying around a ""few"" extra pounds like me, you should stick to a stroller."
1,Hate it,"My baby was not comforatble at all. I felt like it was jabbing right through my shoulder and I couldn't wait to take it off. And though I'm not a big girl, I found it totally unflattering. My Bjorn is a million times more comfortable...and looks great too."
1,Buyer Beware,"Yes, the show is great even if the sound is muddy from high-generation tapes of a radio broadcast. However, this is NOT a legal release in the US and is considered a BOOTLEG. It would be nice if the original pre-broadcast tapes could be located and released, but given PF's track record on releasing rare material, it seems unlikely.And just so you know, the songs may have titles that are unfamiliar, but that's only because they were renamed when this concept was abandoned. Google and see."
5,The Angel's Cup,"This exceptional story is an intriguing blend of the whimsical and the mysterious. I love to read and this is one of my favorite types of stories. The plot moves between an ancient relic, a diary of long ago events, and the present day. I liked the unexpected plot twists as the story unfolds. It has it all - humor, suspense, and romance. This is a great book to read on a rainy day, a day at the beach, or just relaxing.The characters are well developed and varied - you get to know them. I highly recommend this book."
3,Not Up to Par With Kitchenaid Quality,"I have had other Kitchenaid processors, but this one seemed too be of an inferior quality. The chopping blade is thin and it doesn't appear to be screwed in well enough for long term endurance compared to other blade designs I've seen. Food gets stuck between the slicing and grating blades and the chute because of the ridge formed around the chute and the lid. I don't like the complicated chute locking system on the Cuisanart processors, but the basic DCL 5model without the locking chute lid is a very good machine."
2,Very Basic,"As a long time user of several versions of Dreamweaver and UltraDev I found this book useless for advanced and even intermediate topics. If you are an advanced user SKIP this book. I was very dissapointed with the book and found the title misleading. It should be HOW TO DO A LITTLE BIT WITH DREAMWEAVER MX.On the other hand, anything basic I needed to relearn for MX was easy to find and easily understandable. If you are just starting out with Dreamweaver MX it is a solid consideration as far as I can tell."
2,Poor quality....broke it within minutes!,"The steamer works that's why it got 2 stars. The attachments are of poor quality and mine broke just as I started doing the floor. I would recommend this for doing tubs, toilets, small things only."
1,worked amazingly well for 2 months then died completely,"We beyond loved this for the 2 months it worked. Then went to use it this weekend and it was completely broken. Wouldn't heat up. I called the company 40 minutes later, after speaking with three different people, none of who I could understand, they told me to ship it back to them in NC and pay for shipping to and from the factory. They want the original box. A copy of the receipt. All the accessories it comes with. A letter explaining what is wrong with it. Oh and a 2-3 month turn around time to fix it or give me a refurbished one. Looking into it shipping will cost about $50round trip. Terrible company and an unreliable product."
3,Attachements melt,"I love this product for it's versatility. HOWEVER...the 2nd time I used the mop attachment, a piece melted, breaking it off and rendering the mop function totally useless. When the model number is entered at Shark for parts/service, it comes up not found. I'm still waiting to see if they actually answer my inquiry and replace my melted part. I'm not holding my breath. They need to make the attachments out of something better than plastic. This product is too expensive to be made so cheap.It also would be nice if I could see how much water is left in the unit, but it's not possible."
1,waste of Money,"Got this primarily to clean the grout in my kitchen.1. the brushes are no good after one use.2. does not do any better a job than a toothbrush and soap3. Still had to clean grout with toothbrush and soapthis thing is now sitting in my garage gathering dustat best, it does make steam."
