3,Has some funny moments.,"Forces of Nature wasn't a bad film. It wasn't that original, but there were a handful of laughable parts though. The acting was good and the story wasn't bad either. The cinematograhy was interesting in places too. Forces of Nature was a pretty good movie."
5,Great movie!!!,This is a great movie and has a lot of laughs. Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck have perfect chemistry. One of my favorites!
3,Strictly for the beginner,"This book is very much about the mechanics of travel writing.The author writes well, but if you are already writing this is probably not the book for you.Strictly for someone starting out - and in that case, this would be an excellent guide."
4,Very strong but a bit narrow,"The title to this review says it all. It's a bit heavy so when riding you may need to keep it in a backpack or something. Other than that, it's a really good lock."
5,safety,"i see bikes with stolen wheels ALL THE TIME. this lock and a chain is all i need and no one has touched my bike. this think is a great deterrent, it's easy to use and it's sturdy. it will be around and still working when i'm long gone. it also has a proprietary key system that defies picking by a kid with a hairpin."
3,Not so great...,I bought this book a few months back thinking I was in for a good read...I have to say that I am very disappointed. I guess my expectations were a fast paced read like the Bourne series and this is nothing like that style of book or writing. The other side of this is that I really don't even think it is all that funny. I don't want to finish it but I have a few more chapters to go...I can't wait to start another book and put this one down.
5,"Superb reader, really informative",This book was recommended to me as an informatavie introduction to American politics.I was delighted by the level of detail and the way it was put together. A must buy for anyone interested in or studing American government/politics.
1,"Ja, ja,ja, ja,ja.","Another of Dorfman ""Masterpieces"". This is the same guy who wrote how Donald Duck was an instrument of American Imperialism. (Yeah, really).Dorfman is one of those Allende-Orphans who still believes everything that happened in Chile was because of this really, really bad man named Pinochet. Him, Allende, the left, the guerillas, did nothing wrong. The book is just a reflection of such a biased view.I'm glad to be the first one reviewing this book. It means few are paying attention to this clown-author."
3,Cavalcade (DVD) 1933 Best Picture,I purchased this DVD on my quest to see all of the Best Picture Winners. It was interesting in it's historical value; spanning thirty years from the Boer War near the turn of the century to the 1930's. I rated it OK although it was probably a great film for the time.
3,this dagger looks mean,"The only issue with this is the blade appears too thin. It would have be much better if it were 1/16"" thicker. So don't drop it on any hard surface. The design is quite unique. It makes a very nice display."
1,Worst Vaccum ever,I concurr with the other reviews. The vaccum lasted less the 8 months. The roller doesn't work and when using the hose (only thing that works) it emitts a burning smell.
5,God Calling by A.J. Russell,Excellent little daily readings to go along with daily Bible readings. No one could have made this up -- the truths are just too awesome. These words make you think and want to follow Jesus' way of life for us.
1,This book is highly deceptive!,"If you read the two prefaces carefully, you will note that the second one refers to the ""two listeners"" receiving physic messages through automatic writing or channeling! This is cleverly hidden in one sentence. Therefore, the ""sweet"" messages one may receive from this book may NOT be from our Lord, but the angel of light. Why? Because there is little substance to the book itself. It keeps one from reading what the Christian ought to: the Bible! Dear Christians, use your discernment. Don't waste your time on this book when the source is so questionable!"
5,Great Book!,This is a great book! Highly recommend. I purchased this book for my step-mother and she absolutely loves it. Terrific!
5,A beutiful book,Because the daily readings are very meaningful and seem to speak to what is happening in my life and makes me reflect on things. A truly beautiful book!
5,Perfect,"This is a must for people that don't have much time for reading Bible studies. I have had this book for years, wanted this beautiful edition."
4,Refreshing Devotional,"I first encountered this book a number of years ago and a friend called it to my attention again so we ordered it for a number of people. What is so unique about it, I think, is that it is written as if Jesus is speaking to you personally. Once you sense that and begin to flow with it I have found that it has a special kind of power to it. Of course, it is a daily devotional so I combine it with a few others for my morning routine. It usually adds a special insight due to its perspective."
2,author is chatty,"The clear scripture would be helpful if the author would focus more upon that. It seems he strays, and avoids staying with scripture for revealation/meaning. This changes the book into a story more about him (author) than God. It is his experiences about God with his own personal filter absorbing most of the text. I hoped for a book fully about God, revealing the richness of His vast nature/character. I hope the author makes more room for God in his personal life than he does in this book."
5,ITS SO FUNNY I LOVE IT,ITS A FUNNY MOVIE ALAN ALDA DID A WONDERFUL JOB ACTING WRITING DIRECTING IT I CAN WATCH IT 10 TIMES OR MORE AND NEVER GET BORED WATCHING IT.FROM A BIG ALAN ALDA FAN FOR 4 YEARS NOW KIRSTEN
3,Roxy Chick,"This book kept me reading throughout the entire novel but there were some things that bothered me:1. Are teenagers really this sex crazed?2. Would a High school teacher really allow a student to make a project about sex?!3. I went to high school once and usually at least a couple of parents cared about the safety of their children (sex, drugs etc.)This book maybe even promote sex and therefore a book written like this should maybe take place out of high school."
1,"Great for telephone, terrible for stereo/tv","The setup is nice. Clips on to your collar, or on your shirt, the earbuds isolate sound very well, and sound quality is good. The problem is, the reception is AWFUL. If you turn your body 1/4 turn away from the transmitter, the signal drops out. I bought this for watching tv/video/dvds, along with the matching transmitter. I linked it to my cell phone, and it works well for that, but listening around the house this stinks. Drops out constantly, even if you are near the transmitter sometimes. I have used the Motorola headphones, which are a traditional form factor, over the ear type. Those are amazing, strong reception, nary a dropout, but this Sony earbud-style receiver is not very good. It just doesn't deliver as promised."
4,Great performance with a nice sounding piano,"I recently purchased two Beethoven Piano concerto CDs. This set and the other one is Helene Grimaud's, and I like this one much better. I mainly listen to No.4 concerto and his interpretation is rather orthodox and nothing spectacular, but it's more like true Beethoven, while Helene's performace is too Helene. One thing to note on this CD is the sound of the piano. He's using a rebuilt Steinway on this CD and it's sounding excellent, especially in the treble range. This is the true ""crystal tone"" of a good Steinway piano."
4,"First, get a round pen...","This DVD and its companion on gaining your horse's respect gave me a good idea of how to work with one of my horses to get his respect. However, the training assumes you have access to a 50-60 ft. round pen, or some other enclosure that could subsitute for one (though it's hard to think of what a good substitute to a round pen would be for these exercises). The DVDs did convince me that a round pen would probably be a worthwhile investment, but until that happens there isn't much I can do. I do wish that he had spent a little time discussing some activities you might be able to do in the absence of a round pen."
2,"Good basics, BUT...","This unit has good touch on the keys, good display and excellent printing for a 10-key. But I work in finance, and need good capability in calculating lots of percentage changes, and for that this model is AWFUL. The Cost, Sell, and Margin keys are somehow screwed up, and you can never get a proper answer, and yes, I have read the manual. I have to resort to a handheld calculator to get a correct result for percent change, such as a stock price appreciation. And that's pretty basic stuff. I would look elsewhere for a 10-key unless all you need is to +, -, x, & ."
1,Opalescence,"I asked for the Opalescence that takes only 30 minutes. Instead received the type that takes ALL NIGHT!!!! I returned it, requesting the 30 minute tyep again. Received the variety that takes SEVERAL HOURS!!! I am returning it and asking for a refund.Who in the world would want an all-night teeth whitener???"
2,Too long on the shelf?,"I have purchased the 15% Opalescence formula in the past with good results. This time around I noticed little difference in the whitening effect. Since there was no ""use by"" date on the package I am wondering if the product sent was on the shelf too long, simply a bad batch, or even possibly a knock off."
5,A terrific surprise that I didn't know existed!,"I was walking through our local Walgreens the other day and the bright red cover drew me into the budget DVD bin. I saw that it was EWF's Japan Concert and so picked it up, checked it out and bought it. It was a $5.99 special!Well, let me say that I love this DVD. For a long time I was a distant fan and didn't buy their stuff but many of their songs are very memorable. Many of those songs are on this concert. Being that this took place in 1990, the band was at the height of its game and featured their best band. The musicians are simply stellar on this band. Also, for being 22+ years ago, the recording is really decent. Great sound and very decent camera work.The excitement that this DVD exudes is engaging. I am major glad I happened on this one folks. Fortunately, you can still buy it!"
1,Totally confusing,"This film is a disaster. If you haven't read the book, it will make no sense whatsoever (which is why it flopped at the box office). If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed.I realize that a film can't replicate a book, but it should at least have an understandable plot and make it clear how the characters fit into that plot. This film fails on both counts. Scenes flash by so fast you barely have a chance to grasp what's going on. Characters appear out of nowhere; you have no idea who they are.Too bad, because this is one of James Lee Burke's most dramatic books--Dave falls off the wagon when his wife dies. This is a hugely significant part of the story which is way underplayed in the film.I don't think Burke's books are translatable to film."
1,Defective track,On track 26 of the DVD I purchased it got stuck in the middle of track 26. It was an excellent movie but the problem with the DVD caused an interruption the view right at a critical part.
2,Very good background but very very boring...,I bought the book because I liked the clever alternate history background in which the story is set. Unfortunely the narration is dry and very very boring - a real letdown of my high expectation. I forced myself to finish the book just because I hate to leave books half-read on my bookshelf.
2,nothing like a original,LOOKS GOOD AS A CARPETED DAH COVER CAN BUT NOTHING LIKE AN ORIGINAL LOOK.STILL BETTER THAN A CRACKED UP VINYL DASH BUT KINDA MOD FOR A OLDER TRUCK DONT YA THINK?
4,The Ring of Words...great help in the studio,"I've read and studied from many books with translations of texts to lieder and song literature, but I can say that the layout of this book is what a singer needs. Phrase by phrase is made understandable and visually it helps to have the original on the left and the translation on the right, it helps me to memorize faster.The information about the composers who have handled these texts is most interesting and helpful in program planning. My students who are not fluent in German and French have found that they now can handle the subtleties of the songs and song cycles they are preparing.Cynthia Hansell-Baki,opera singer, teacher Croatia"
1,Poor quality,"I purchased 2 sets of these from Amazon to supplement identical sets I already had (also from Thomson Pottery), but the quality of these sets is significantly inferior. The embossed shell pattern is very ill defined and blurry, an there are a lot of flaws. This set is like a very cheap imitation of the original....but actually cost MORE!"
4,Thomson Shell Set.....Buy at Store,"....like so many reviews, one of my three sets arrived with a broken cup. The set was packaged beautifully by Beall's ...whom I purchased these fronm. So, possibly, they received the set from the manufacturer with the broken cup. I did try to contact Beall's through the proper follow up email, identified my issue and NEVER heard back, not a word. For the money, and because we purchased two other sets and had plenty of cups, we didn't pursue a remedy. But, shame on Beall's for their non-response. If we had it to do over, we'd simply go to one of their stores, next time we were in Florida/Georgia."
3,concierge,this was the first book i read about concierge which was quite informative but it lacks detailed information.Concierge manual is a much better read.
3,Gazelle Cross Trainer,"One piece of the item was received broken. the company will be replacing this piece. The timer/scanner has never properly worked. You can not reset the counts after each. This prohibits the user from counting distance, time or calories burned without doing some calculations. The pulse indicator which is part of the scanner, also does not work.I do like the convenience of the gazelle and feel like i am getting a good lower body work out."
3,a ok,"Another just average product that I unfortunately purchased. Because I am addicted to buying random things that I sometimes do not need, I purchased this gazelle. I felt it was great for stretching my legs but it was nothing compared to the gym elliptical machines."
1,This Thing Kinda Sucks,"I feel like this product is just too drastically inferior to an elliptical machine to be worth the purchase, even though it's cheaper.Even when you follow the directions, you're really only working out maybe 3 or 4 muscles. I can run at a pretty good pace for an hour on an elliptical or treadmill, with this thing I can only last 10 minutes or so, as it's just killing my lower leg muscles. That prevents any sort of aerobic exercise.It also advertises that it folds up and rolls, which it does, but it's too large to fit under most beds even then, and too bulky and unstable to just lean against a wall.Don't waste your money on this. It's really a piece of junk."
2,Buyers remorse has set in.,I thought the price was great until I received the machine.It was missing 4 screws and the magnet cluster that operates the computer (which probably won't work anyway).It had several damaged places with the paint peeling off.Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer for the parts that are missing...I'm still waiting for a reply.Fitness Quest doesn't have phone number for customer service so talking to someone is not an option.I feel Amazon should provide the service on products they sell. If it wasn't so costly I'd sent this piece of junk back.This will be my last big purchase from Amazon...next time I'll go to a local store that will provide me with service.
4,Accurate enough?,"The scale is nice-looking. But don't expect it is perfectly accurate. The maximum difference between repeated weighing is about 1 Lb. Plus, it seems it may not work (show 0.0) at all if you put something less than 5~10 Lbs)."
1,This scale is inaccurate by several pounds,I am sorry I ever bought this scale. It is inaccurate by up to 6 pounds! I cannot understand how this can be endorsed by Weight Watchers!I would like to warn everyone never to buy this item.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this scale because the writer of ""The Plan"" diet suggested it. This scale does NOT show the accurate weight. I can step off of it and right back on and the weight is never the same. Even after trying several times the weights are all different. I'll stick with my old Homedics scale, thank you."
5,We love it,This scale met our expectations. We love that it tracks your weight loss for you.We would reccomend it to anyone.
3,"Scale works well, but can't program it","When I received the scale, I read through the instructions but for some reason couldn't get it to save the starting weight and therefore can't use any of those ""extras"" that the scale has to offer (goal weight, change from last weigh, etc.) It was kind of disappointing because I feel as if I did pay extra for a scale that had those features... Anyway, as far as strictly determining current weight, it works great."
3,Just Another Pretty Face,"It's nice to look at but it's no more accurate than a $7 spring scale. Weights are not immediately repeatable and they don't agree with an accurate 'balance' type scale. This'll look pretty in you bedroom or bath though. Can't recommend it at it's current price, get a pretty throw rug instead."
4,Memory Scale WW43/WW43D,CONAIR WW43D WEIGHT WATCHERS(R) GLASS MEMORY PRECISION SCALEI've had this scale for a month now and am very pleased with it. Easy to operate--once you figure out how to open the battery compartment. I have yet to program it. That will be my next step. One thing to keep in mind is that it weighs you a pound under--based on my Weight Watchers weigh in amount. I'll let you know if I still like it after 6 months have passed.
4,WW Glass Electronic Scale,The scale is very easy to read. The scale is about one (1) pound too heavy compared to the scales at the Weight Watchers meeting. No way to adjust the scale.
3,Not exact at all,If you are really trying to lose weight this is not a good scale . Mine says something different everytime I use it . I tried it 5 times in a row and all different. if you just need to generally know around how much you weigh it's fine . But if you are using it for weight loss - don't get this
3,weight watchers scale review,"Modern looking, very reasonable price, accurate to the Doctor's scaleCannot seem to get the buttons to work even after following the instruction manual and having my husband try several times as well. TYhis has been quite frustrating. Luckily I wanted I like it anyway. It would be nice for us to be able to track our weight from month to month as it said we could before buying."
1,return,I am trying to return this item because you sent me 2 and charged me for 2. I do not need 2. What can I do now?Marianne Baldeschwiler
2,Big disappointment,"I bought a used copy of this book at %30 discount, and I still think it was not worth the money.The book is very hard to read, the author puts his personal opinions all over the place very frequently and presents them as facts. Moreover, the content is also all over the place, on one page you are reading about the deep details of IP address formats, a few pages later you encounter the author's opinion about the way oriental people work, and then you read about why so-and-so project failed in 1970s, etc.Most of the bits and pieces of information are related to Chicago Merchantile exchange. The book is full of acronyms, you need to go to the index page at the end of the book to figure out what they mean, yet the explanations in the index sometimes lead to even further confusion.I work in the finance industry, developing trading applications. In my opinion, there are a whole lot of other books that you can better use your time on."
5,A must read for market professionals.,"This book is absolutely a must read for anyone who wants to succeed in tomorrow's totally-electronic trading environment. Like it or not, technology is the future of trading and the sooner you learn about it the better."
2,Padded and Overpriced,"This book does have some good basic information, but it is full of fluff, poorly designed, and overpriced. Most of the images are in black and white (there are some color plates in the center of the book and color images on the Web site, which are small and difficult to find), and there are not nearly enough examples. About 75 pages are devoted to realtors, insurance adjustors, etc. For 24.99, the book would have been better with a couple hundred fewer pages and color pictures.If you want a book to cover the basics, try Derrick Story's ""Digital Photography Pocket Guide,"" or for a much more comprehensive view of digital photography, check out ""Real World Digital Photography."""
2,Not well formatted for Kindle,"The file seems poorly converted for use with the kindle 3. The text is fine but the diagrams and tables are not large enough and have very low resolution. This is simply a poorly made e-book. I can't comment on the quality of the writing itself, but one is better of with either a .pdf or the physical textbook."
2,Poor Binding,"I too agree with them, I am a pchem student, and the binding on my book is coming off, I need to tape it in order to save it from falling off. Yes, the derivation are hard to follow, my professor had to give hand outs on majority of them to show what steps were skipped."
3,Slow but great condition,"The delivery took well over 14 business days to arrive. That said, the book was in perfect condition. Overall, I consider it average service."
4,Excellent Book,"Identical to the hardcover edition, and much less expensive! Arrived in a timely manner in the expected condition."
2,Errors and poor typesetting,"I purchased the Kindle edition for $10, and I read it on a 10 inch Android tablet. For that price, it's well worth it.The Kindle edition is poorly typeset, with figures often appearing far from their proper location, and formulas often scaled too small to read without zooming in on them individually. Still more are unreadable due to missing fonts or characters. It seems like nobody took the time to properly review this before publishing for Kindle.Couple that with the occasional (or perhaps frequent) errors, including incorrect data. I'm often uncomfortable with the fact that my primary and most convenient source of data is not entirely reliable."
2,"Very thorough book, but not to the point","I had to stop reading this book after about 60 pages, due to the exauhsting format of reading about everyone other than Patton. This book would be good for those with a lot of patience, and those that are interested in Patton's parent's, grand parents (as well as learning about their life, careers, likes/dislikes, ect)and the pain staking, very lengthy details of the background of every senario in Patton's life.I would simply like a very intriguing book, that gets to the damn point, but can keep my attention."
5,This is my favorite of Chet's recordings,"This album is SO perfect because it's NOT perfect. There is a little emotional weariness in Chet's voice, and there are times when you can hear a bit of a struggle with his flugelhorn (his trumpet was stolen before he recorded this album.) But that is what gives this album such a human quality, you can truly hear the sadness in Chet's voice when he sings ""Born to Be Blue"" - as though the song is about him. His playing is usually phenomenal, but you can hear a bit of a struggle on his usually so perfectly executed ballad solos, and there is such beauty to it. I love this album because it has such a wonderful human quality - there is so much emotion in Chet's voice and playing, that you can almost feel with him. Definitely buy this CD if you like Chet, or even if you just want a great jazz CD to add to your collection."
5,Good first time service.,"I hads this in cassette, one of my jazz favorite albums, so I decided to buy the cd. It lasted just a month to arrive to Argentina Ok, so the service was fine. Thanks to everybody!.Roberto"
4,Creamy & Delicious...but...,"Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering. Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature. It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet. Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you. For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice."
2,so so,"This was a very mediocre cheesecake -- with an overly-dry and overly-thick crust all around it. the cake itself was bland and It is also very, very small -- it will serve six only if you give everyone a sliver. If it had been rich, creamy and flavorful that would have been acceptible, unfortunately that was not the case. For the price, I expected something better than what you could get at the local bakery -- but even the supermarket variety is better."
4,Works good.,I had a little trouble getting it into the vacuum. It was a hairs breath too big. But I got it in and it works good... no problems.
5,Works good,I had not changed this filter on my vacuum for years and wondered why I wasn't getting the suction I should... this did the trick.
4,OK,The price was better then WalMart and product the same.It's a filter sorry don't love it but then I don't like to vacuum.
1,Can't get there from here.,"I have tried to order the Downtown CD twice. It supposedly has 15 tracks on it. Each time Amazon sends me a CD with only six tracks on it. The song I wanted was You'd Better Love Me. But it is not one of the six tracks. Although they refunded my money, I still can't find a way to get Petula Clark singing You'd Better Love Me. Suggestions are welcome. I don't get any meaningful response from customer service. I'll bet it's a good CD, I just can't get it. Help."

This Is Goodbye10. Let Me Tell You11. You Belong To Me12. Downtown13. I Will Follow Him14. Darling Cheri15. You'd Better Love Me
3,"Service was great, product not so sure yet.","The product is heavier than I had wanted. The vibration is very strong even at the lowest speed, so if that is what you are looking for it is great."
1,Yet another disappointing season.,"As far as the product goes- The Blue-ray release looks dandy. As far as the season goes- Season 7 of ""24"" tries to hold interest, by doing changes in characters(namely, Jack and Tony) and also by bringing new character on board. However, every single new character is generic and boring to the ears and the eyes. This also sums up season 7. It tries with a decent opener, but the rest of the season is a snooze-fest. ""24"" had a great run, but it has passed its time of death, by two seasons. It needs to end, or I need to quit watching."
5,"I Love ""24""","Once the season was over, I was determined to purchase the complete series. This series was one of the best in a while. The price made it easier to purchase. I'm still waiting for the price of season 4 to get lower, from it's current price. If you like this season, purchase it now while the price is low, and enjoy!"
3,Show just kept repeating itself,"A very good series when it first started. Action packed, good drama, a lot of double crosses and of course torture. Good in the begining but the show kept doing the same thing over and over again. They never trust Jack, then they have egg on there face. It got old fast. As the Show went on it just did the same old stuff. Got old fast. Cannot believe they are makinga movie out of this show. Enough already! End it already. Get it if you like this show and you want it in your collection. It has good action but not many surprises."
5,24,It's another season of 24. What else to say.If you like the previous seasons you will like this one.
5,Outstanding Television,"24 is by far the best of the best of any television show. This show make you sit on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. Thru all the conspiracies, Moles, and the intense pressure for Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland)to get to the truth, by any means necessary. It make you think of John McClane(Bruce Willis) of Die Hard or The Last Boy Scout, as he gets beaten and tortured and that just makes him angry. ""Hit me again and I'll kill you"" When its just one of those bad days and this man, who doesn't wear a cape or has super powers, uses his skills and experience to stop the bad guys, and save peoples lives. You experience the chronicles of Jack Bauer moments thru a 24 hour day. Each day is a season. Day 7 just ended, with fans thirsting for another day. If you have not seen this show pick up season 1-7 on DVD. Seeing it in Blu-ray made it even better. But be warned: May cause sleep depravation due to many hours of non-stop viewing."
5,Awesome Season 7,"Season 7 was very well written. An awesome 24 hours of suprises, twists, & turns!! By far one of the best Seasons since 24 began & that's an arguable point amongst die-hard fans of the show!! The S7 DVD set is somewhat lacking in the special features compared to the previous 6 Seasons. If you bought S7, I highly recommend that you also get Redemption as that as all fans of the show knows is a prequel to S7!! Redemption also has the same special features that the 3 disc special edition has, so I would suggest you save the extra $35.00 as you're actually spending the extra money for a digital copy!! Now that I own all 7 Collector Ed. DVD's, I can rewatch (as I already have) whenever I want!!"
3,Delicious parody but not roll-on-the-floor funny,"It is important to laugh at ourselves once in a while. This book will help Christians do that - to look at ourselves and realize how silly and self-absorbed we can be in our more wild dogmatism. Perhaps we take ourselves too seriously and need to step back and see ourselves at our most shallow.Ignore the ""experts"" who tell you of illusive codes that only the enlightened gnostics can illuminate from scripture. Dig, study, learn, and never settle for simplistic preaching without scratching the surface to see if there is any real substance underneath. This book can help you laugh at yourself and give you the courage to venture out on your own in the study of eschatology. Noone will need hold your hand on the journey any longer."
1,Right Behind,"This review points scale doesn't go low enough. This book deserves a -5. If you want to read something worth your time, you'd be better off reading a dictionary. These books are written by men who have no understanding of Biblical prophecy whatsoever and are absolutely clueless to what the end times will be like. The Left Behind series has done so much for spreading Christianity and no Christian has any business reading this filth. I'm sorry if i come off harsh, but mess with my God and ridicule an outreach the He's using, and you'll have to hear the truth. The Bible says that in the last days men will turn away from truth, and wanting to have their ears tickled, will turn to doctrines taught by deamons. This is precisely what we have here. This is heresy in it's purest form, and my advise is to avoid it all together."
1,HOGWASH,This book ridicules the very series of books that God has given us to use as a tool to help lead others to Christianity. This book is something that I have found useful in helping to bring a number of friends to Christ. God has planted a seed with the LEFT BEHIND SERIES and that is something that should not be made fun of or overlooked. Overall I felt right behind was a book that makes fun of God and something he has used to bring many people to him.
5,Question on Book,"Hi, I didn't read this book yet. I only know of it because it's going to be a movie out early next year. And since one of my fave actors, Johnny Whitworth plays Max Raimi, I was wondering if anyone who read the book can tell me how much of Max is in the book? Thanks!"
3,Not nearly as good as I expected it to be,I was disappointed in this book. It got such great reviews from critics and readers alike that I thought for sure I had stumbled on a winner. To bad for me that the book was slow and that the ending just reeked. I also never felt as if the main character were in any real danger from Valentine.
4,World stage for this espionage/intrigue story.,I enjoyed this book very much and found it easy to follow the tangled plot as it wove its way around the world. I also liked the fact that the romance was not spelled out in livid detail! Imagination is what reading is all about and this book allowed my mind to picture the scenes and the characters. I will look forward to another book by this talented author!
5,Chasing Destiny,"This is a great movie with Lauren Graham. Lauren has a leading part in this movie and it is just a really nice ""feel good"" movie. This movie shows Lauren's great acting abilities."
1,For Beginners,"I have been an artist for over 35 years. I bought this ""book"" just to see if there was any cloud painting techniques that I could use in my paintings. I hate to say this, but I can paint better clouds and I think almost anyone else could, except maybe the new, first time artist. An then I would tell them to not by this book. The TV show ""Joy of Painting"" does better at showing now to paint clouds."
4,A refreshing mental snack,"Miracles was a much-needed reminder of why I love to read: the powerful articulation of a principle, the surprise of the perfect analogy or metaphor, and a fresh perspective on an old challenge. Lewis's goal in Miracles is to convince us that miracles are not unreasonable. He does this admirably. He points out that one subscribing to materialism has no real grounds on which to criticize miracles. In fact, the materialist has no warranted grounds for his choice of materialism because Reason itself is not grounded in materialism. However, the chapter ""Christianity and 'Religion'"" looms as the most brilliant in the book. In it, he delineates a god that men create from the God who is. He concludes the chapter with the following statement: ""There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion ('Man's search for God!') suddenly draw back. Supposing we really found Him? We never meant it to come to that! Worse still, supposing He had found us?"""
2,Thexton Hose Removal Pliers,"I ordered Thexton since I've had good luck with their tools,but the pliers were ground extremely bad,the person that ground the angle has one side much thicker than the other side which is very thin! They still can be used to remove a hose,but I won't put junk in my tool box so I ordered a set of three by Pittsburg Tool from Harbor Freight for $15.00 and they all were in perfect shape. Hard to believe,but true. I would never pick these off a shelf to buy for sure. Also it would be nice to state the size they are which is the bigger hoses such as heater hose 5/8-3/4 or larger since they are made in a set of three sizes for smaller hoses also. The picture looked like they were 1/2"". I ordered these from amazon.com which I'm sure they'd take back,but not worth the trouble. I'm also sure that Thexton doesn't have this quality control every time.I'm just the lucky person this time."
2,No So Much Like Lime,"I LOVE lime, and have found it difficult to find something lime scented that doesn't combine something else with it. Knowing how Demeter generally hits things right on the head, I was excited for this to be delivered.I'm not disappointed. It has more of a lemon-lime soda scent. I thought maybe it was just me, and had some friends try it, covering up the label, and asking them what it was - all four said lemon-lime soda. Sigh.It also seems to fade quickly, and the scent doesn't stay as with most Demeter products. If you want something that smells just like a fresh cut lime, this isn't it."
1,Smells like cheap alcohol,I smelled Tomato at a boutique a number of years ago and loved it. This stuff is hideous. It smells more like the carrying medium than tomatoes. It's the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon in the past 14 years. Wish i could return it but I can't because it's a flammable substance.
3,Average,"The writer of this screenplay has obviously studied the ""coincidence genre"" of screenwriting, where many lives conveniently intersect in ways that affect the characters and the outcome. And that's fine--many movies have done wonderful things with the idea of chance.The problem here first and foremost is that the weight of the conclusion just isn't validated by the sum of the parts (and that's all I can say about that without spoilers). Instead, the result is almost pathetic. There is nothing profound or insightful here unless perhaps you are a young person who has a fatalistic view of first loves.On the positive side, the movie is well made and atmospheric, and the actors are endearing, if lacking depth. There seems to be a promise of something special building from the opening scene but sadly it's never fulfilled."
5,Serving Platter,"This is a nice looking and perfect size platter for everyday use. In fact, I'm thinking of ordering another one. You can't go wrong with this."
3,Not Complete episodes - maybe,"This is a good show - very off color tho. The insults are hilarious, but I would never say them aloud myself, (they are gross).If these are the same discs Netflix sends out (or watch online); then they have been edited. At least one has a whole scene missing (most have little bits here and there)I can't say for certain whether or no these disks have been edited, but I would expect so. I doubt the manufacturer created new Masters for the complete collection"
5,There is no better!,"I've had this pot for over 2 months. I've made at least 12 pots of tea with it. It is awesome. Easy to use, and easy to clean once you get the hang of it. I've got some other tea pots, but they have been moved to the back of the shelf. This pot stays on my counter for instant use. I like it quite a bit. Loose tea is the way to go.Of course you have to be careful with it.The instructions for making tea are spot on. But I use a spoon more of tea because I like it strong.Try and wait for this to go on sale to make the tea taste even better with that little dash of 'good buy' in it."
4,electromagnetism from continuum mechanics point of view,"This is a good book on classical electrodynamics. It is on about the same level as Jackson or the fine recent book by Schwinger et al. even if it perhaps attempts to be more elementary.In stark contrast to Schwinger (and Jackson) it takes a continuum mechanics point of view as fundamental. There are no atoms and no averageing is used to find macroscopic fields from microscopic. This has some advantages but, in my opinion, hides the fact that in vacuum there are only two fields while in media two polarization fields must be added.Many things are very pedagogical and clear in Kovetz book and it is probably a good book to learn from. The book uses SI-units and is unusual in that it discusses thermodynamics and continua more thourougly than its competitors."
5,The perfect gift,"If Erma Bombeck had been a grandfather she would have written this terribly clever and witty book. I've recommended it to all my friends having children. The real scoop ooops ""poop"" by grandson, Max is hilarious. If there's a way to know what's going on inside a baby's brain, writer, Saul Turteltaub, did it. It starts with the writer positive he's not going to be one of those sloppy grandfathers insessantly talking about a two month old baby who does nothing by lay there...by the end he's showing pictures to complete strangers on the street. Very, very cute!"
5,Excellent Gift,Purchased this as a gift for a business associate who was becoming a grandfather for the first time and he loved it.
5,So sweet!,"I have a few other lullaby CD's and this one's by far the best. The songs are absolutely beautiful, it almost brings me to tears (esp. the song Baby Mine). I play this for my 3 month old baby at most bedtimes, and she always drifts into a sound sleep. What a peaceful, pleasant way to end the day..."
5,Best lullaby album ever!!!,"Got this CD when my baby was 8 weeks old along with a handful of others. The others are fine -- some are even really great compilations -- but they pale in comparison to this CD and have rarely been played as a result. My daughter is now 15 months old now and we have been playing this CD every single night for over a year. That alone says a lot since I personally like variety and tend to tire of the same things quickly. I don't think I can tire of this disc. It helps put baby to bed and is very soothing and relaxing for me as well. If you have to get just one album, this is it!"
4,Not as good as volume two,"We love the second volume CD! This uses the same instrumentation, but the song selection is weaker. I can listen to the second volume over and over it's that good. This one is good, but if you only need one CD, I'd get the second volume."
2,Great pictures but...,I was disappointed in it mainly because the pictures (which are great) are not well intergrated with the text. I was forever paging back & forth until I just gave up on it. It still remains unread.
1,"It's [weak], yet I still bought it (ask me why)","I was first introduced to ""AirBoss"" at[weak] screen play, political incorrectness (not that that's necessarily a bad thing), and a plethora of military inaccuracies. Yet, I couldn't look away, nor stop laughing. Too bad Mystery Science Threatre 3K isn't still on the air."
1,This film neglects meaningful history,"This film is more like a soap opera than a history movie. It heavily focuses on a few relationships but badly neglects why the countries were fighting, what reforms Napoleon was making, and why Napoleon was such a great commander.You will learn far more watching the one hour documentary about Napoleon in the History Channel DVD *The Conquerors.* It shows how much this film leaves out."
2,Good to look at but no substance,I really looked forward to this. However it left me disappointed. The problem is the person who plays Napoleon. Not only does he not look like Napoleon he never convinces you that he has the intellectual ability that Napoleon surely must have had. Lovely to look at but no soul.
1,O My,"Well, I hate to rain on your little parade, but this has to be the worst piece of u know what.I just heard this song(not to mention under went the terrifying process of WATCHing THE video) when it was on VH1, and I have to say, I didn't know whether to laugh or throw up.Thank goodness that this song isn't around in these times, cause I honestly don't know how I would handle it.The only reason why I'd suggest you try and listen to it would be to get a great laugh out of it.Seriously, anyone who likes this song must be on speed or something.I wonder if the people who made this song were on an overdose when they made this song??"
3,"Response to: A music fan from Las Cruces, NM United States","I have the ""Nail Broth"" record. It is called ""6 Stories From Far Away Places"" If I see your e-mail address in your review I'll e-mail you. I have converted the record to CD."
3,Remarkable Stories by Danny Kaye,"I as well am looking for a CD copy of Danny Kaye's record from ""Remarkable Stories"". If ""A Music Fan"" reads this please email me at nicster01@hotmail.comI hope it is the one I am thinking of and has the story of Hansel and Gretal on it as well as many others. Many thanks."
1,Piece of overpriced junk!,"We spent over thirty dollars on this door, as we are relocating our cat's litter boxes into an alcove. As with the other reviewers of this product, we have found the assembly to be virtually impossible. We had the forsight to cut the insert strips before assembling the door, however, we have still met with the ridiculous task of trying to hold the two inserts together WHILE keeping the plastic barrier strips in the tiny grooves, which, by the way, never lock into place properly, we are almost an hour & a half into production and we aren't finished yet...just another example of throwaway ecconomy...spend lots of money on a product that'll be junk, most likely before you're done putting it together."
1,Very hard to install,"I just finished trying to install the cat door and the instructions are very inadequate. There is no words, just pictures that are confusing to interpret. I thought the flap would take about 30 minutes to install - it took 90 minutes and because the instructions were bad it wasn't even installed the correct way. Save your money and look for something else."
1,Crap,"Piece of Crap. Worst Design ever. Buy something else. Anything else, really. Buy a hatchet and smash a hole in the door; it will work better than this huge piece of crap product. Did I mention it was complete crap? Crap Crap Crap."
3,It Works Fine,"I agree with the other reviews that this is not very easy to install. It took a lot of patience, but once it was installed it worked fine for me. My cat is very strong & weighs about 10-15lbs. He hasn't caused any damage to the product & very little draft during the winter. I highly recommend having another person help you install the product."
2,My cat charged the flap like a wounded bull,"We use this cat flap to keep a door closed, stopping the litter smell from going throughout the house. We also wanted to lock the flap to be able to feed one of our cats separately. We locked the cat flap and put the food-stealing cat in the room. As soon as he heard the food outside the room, he started head butting the locked cat flap. I watched and was happy the flap was holding, however after 30 secs, he started to back up and ram the cat flap with a running start. At this point it appeared the cat flap would break. I quickly let him out before the small plastic locks broke.The cat flap performs the task of preventing air flow out of the room, but the locks are useless to me."
1,Biggest POS ever,"If you have already cut your circular hole in the door before you realize what a piece of crap you just bought, check out the You Tube video on how to assemble this abomination from the manufacturer, as it gives a couple of instructions that the unhelpful diagrams do not, including using TAPE to hold this mess in place. Staywell owes me four hours of my life back."
2,Cheap junk but a cat can walk through it,"The review by ""logers"" is exactly right. This thing is horrible to install, with very poor graphics for instructions which are not even accurate. The various pieces of cheap flimsy plastic don't fit together well. I actually softened one of the inner rings by placing it in boiling water for a few minutes so we could finally force it into place, and we resorted to gluing the inner pieces to hold them in place to lessen the juggling act. Once we started screwing the outside pieces together they cracked - yet it still is not snug against the door in other spots. I guess it does serve its purpose, because now that it is somewhat securely in place the cat can walk through it. Thankfully the ugly cracks are facing inside the basement and not seen by any visitors to our home."
1,Worst Product Ever,Installation is a complete nightmare!!!!! The door is loud and clanky. Please don't waste your money on this product!!!!!
1,Absolutely Awful,Instructions have no words and are unclear. Product will not assemble properly. I ended up using copious quantities of glue to get it to stay in the door and work. It is a horrible product. DO NOT BUY.
4,Rankins' work is magnificent.,This is a refreshing mix of Kenny Rankins' soothing music style. I am sure it will be enjoyed by anyone who knows & loves his music. Simply the best !
4,Muy bueno,"Lo compré hace como 5 años y a la fecha funciona perfectamente con mi PDA HP. No toda las funciones del teclado funcionan a la perfección con la HP y la inserción de carácteres especiales no es sencilla, pero para tomar notas rápidas en reuniones o cursos es perfecta, de hecho la utilicé para mi maestría."
4,Great Stuff,"If you want to learn to move to a higher level of living, to move into the area of effortless, joyful living - this is the small book all should have."
5,A must read,This is a wonderful book. Though I would suggest to readers that they might start with his book The Foundation of Mysticism first or another of his books. This book is very intense and powerful. If everyone read this book the world would be a better place.
3,Great review but ...,Great for review but the NCLEX questions were just too easy and nothing like the real NCLEX that I just took a few days ago. I would however highly recommend it just for reviewing purposes!!
1,cracking the nclex rn 2000,"I found multiple mistakes on the CD tests. I feel this has hurt me, considering I have trusted that their answers were correct. This was very upsetting and confusing considering I only have 3 days until I test.I would NOT reccommend this or any other of their books !"
3,The story of Miss China's Ring comes to life in this anime.,"In a small town lives a girl named Miss China, the owner of the local tavern and her friends. In an unexplained phenomenon, a message appears on the night of a full moon and she wants to know how it got there.The story around Miss China's Ring includes many different stories rolled into one. The movie features the story of three characters and leaves viewers hanging, giving the impression that more characters and different stories will be told if this series progresses. The character designs are very well drawn and could be closely compared to the Disney style of animation. The movie does not contain any adult situations and because of that, I feel that this title is safe for the whole family to enjoy END"
5,Excellently done,"It is hard to see how this book could be improved upon. It is meticulously researched and footnoted, and there is a comprehensive bibliography. The viewpoint of the author is not pro-secessionist, albeit he tells us he lives in Richmond. This book literally allows one to live the last days of Confederate Richmond with the people who were there, and I found this was an experience well worth the time spent reading the book. It is a good supplementary companion to Jay Winik's April 1865: The Month that Saved America."
2,I'm in agreement with the reviewer from Texas,"This had all the ingredients of a brilliant showcase of something new and exciting: a 21 year old familiar with only the latest in photographic technology, not building on the base of knowledge that almost every other well known photographer has been exposed to. A rawness evident in edgy and pixelated photos primarily sexual in content. Unfortunately, five pages in one realizes that they've purchased a rather expensive copy of Penthouse. Save for one or two truly good pictures, these are uninteresting photos of a very pretty naked girl having sex. Total letdown. Kudos to the design of the book, though!"
4,Enlightening,An eye-opener for those of us who live in areas where hispanic immigrants are needed and present in significant numbers. Gives a needed perspective on the point of view of those seeking to share in the American Dream in a new and unique way. Essential reading for anyone whose ancestors were also immigrants (and weren't they all?).
2,"""Chris""? Why not Adam, Bob, Lisa, Beth?","This book transformed me into a ""former admirer"" of D'Souza. D'Souza could have addressed his letters to Bob, Gregg, Lisa, Beth, Adam or any of the hundreds of names that are less divisive and more helpful to the cause that he is attempting to advance in this book. His choice to address the letters to ""Chris,"" make a stronger point than the letters themselved do. This undermines the book, the author and the cause itself and has certainly turned me off. I am sympathetic to the cause he is promoting, but much less so after this book."
5,must read,The mere fact that it has received some 1 star reviews and some 5 star reviews shows that it is a controversial book. Liberals will hate it and conservatives will find great no-nonsense descriptions of the philosophies we uphold so strongly. His writing style makes it a relatively easy read for anyone.
4,Good guide for young conservatives,"While reading this I have to admit that I wish D'Souza had written it ten years ago when I was just starting university. It would have saved me reinventing the wheel as a campus activist and learning the hard way some of the lessons he teaches in Letters to a Young Conservative. It's almost a given that the higher the amount of vitriol leveled at a conservative the more spot on they are about the issues and D'Souza takes a lot of flack over what he writes. This book shows you why. His essential points: use the truth, be fearless and never stop fighting. A worthy guide for campus conservatives."
5,Toyota Solara Custom Sunshade,"A Perfect fit, that leaves my Solara comfortable even on the hottest days. The only drawback is also its design success; this item will not fold up and slip into a glovebox."
2,try his stories instead,"Somehow, this piffling little wifty novel won a National Book Award in 1958. The, supposedly, tragicomic story of the decline of the Wapshot family--father Leander, a ferry boat captain, & his sons Coverly and Moses--left me totally unmoved and uninterested.N.B.--I'm writing this two years later (May 2000) and I've figured it out. Cheever was a master of the short story (see Orrin's review of The Stories of John Cheever) and the Modern Library panel simply rewarded a bad novel in an attempt to acknowledge him as a writer. The book's still dreck, but it makes a little more sense that it made the list.GRADE: D"
3,Wandering with the Wapshots,"Cheever is an excellent writer,but is less effective in this novel as a storyteller. The first half of the novel hangs together quite well, but then he seems to lose control and strange unconnected events intrude. Some of the chapters would probably been better off as short stories. Read it for the excellent prose, but be prepared to be less than fulfilled by the plot."
3,"A Decent Read, But Not a Classic","This is highly enjoyable and interesting for the way in which Cheever constructs this New England world. The part is only so-so, but as a vehicle for understanding the characters it pays dividends."
4,verry good book about a strong family.,good story about a man and his love of life.it's the story of his sons and their many different choices.i loved it.
2,Kept waiting for it to start,"Let it be known that I listened to this book on cassettes. It may read differently. About 2/3 of the way through, I realized that all the character and place descriptions were there for their own sake. Up to that point, it led me to falsely think we needed to know the information for future reference. This book is not ""about"" anything. It follows the lives of a few fairly ordinary people and generally covers ground many other works have covered, but does so with Cheever's style. But when a book is about little other than the writing style of the author, it smacks of self-indulgence. I can recommend Cheever's great short stories, but this novel takes a long time to go nowhere and say things many other writers have also said."
4,Black comedy and poignant moments,"Very entertaining prose by a writer that is already largely forgotten. Quirky New Englanders provide poignant emotions and hilarious pieces -- I didn't expect to like this, but it's one of the better books I've read recently."
4,Very Fine,"John Cheever's fine, woven prose is the perfect fit for this novel about an eccentric family living in along the coast of Massachusetts. St. Boltophs is a fictional town, where the Wapshots, a declining though still respected east-coast family reside. At its heart, this novel is about a contrasting pair of brothers, Moses and Coverly as they live under the fading light of their father Leander. Moses is the ambitious brother who marries into money, and Coverly is the sensitive, if a bit timid brother who also falls into a tragic marriage. There are fine moments of writing in this novel-Cheever's attention to voice and detail is among the strongest of American writers. Though this is far from a great book, it is clearly a fine achievement and well worth reading."
4,New England Style Machismo,"The central characters are the Wapshot males - Leander and his two sons Coverly and Moses.Leander is an old New England salt in the winter of life, while his sons are just coming into their own as young men.The older female charcters exhibit an exterme form of bitchiness and excentricity. While the younger females all seem to be rather flighty and promiscious. I am suprised that female readers were not put off by Cheever's chauvinism.Cheever achieves a unique yet powerful style with the contrite journal of life that Leander pens. Especially poiignant is Leander's letter to Coverly after the son reveals to his Father the homosexual advances that he had encountered and his accompanying fellings of guilt.All in all it was a worthwhile read at least from a male point of view. Female readers may disgree."
5,An Excellent Dacyczyn,Dacyczyn does not encourage us to follow her methods literally; she only suggests looking at our spending habits and realigning them. Spending less money on areas which we consider low-priority leads to higher savings and monre money to spend on things we consider important to us.
1,reusable tampons.... give me a break!,"I'm all about finding a new frugal tip but I also like to maintain a certain standard of lifestyle and cleanliness. This book did not help me along those lines. Some of the things in here were just plain disgusting (a reusable tampon???) and some were just plain ridiculous (saving a half eaten apple for streusel later???) Nope. That isn't frugal, it is fanaticism. I also had a real problem with the writer. In at least half of the comments from people who had written in with tips, she put a blurb beneath them either contradicting their tip or ""trumping"" them with a tip of her own. I found her to be obnoxious and self-glorified. The ONLY section with any merit was the Christmas section where there were a few cute homemade gift ideas. Other than that, save the trouble and time of reading this book."
3,"Oh, so sad...","I found this film rather hard to watch. In fact, I watched it in two sittings. It was very, very sad I thought. The main character Melanie was abused by her rotten students. And had almost no social life. She seemed almost completely alone, needy, and rather voyeuristic as she peered out of her window watching the world go by. For some reason this film from the amazing [...] catalogue did not grab me. As other reviewers have mentioned this film was shot on quite a small budget and it looked it. Also the ending was rather ambiguous. While this film was not without merit, it was uncomfortable to watch."
3,mostly readable and accessible and interesting,"This compact DIY book goes through a broad introduction of the field of linguistics including basic terminology, concepts, and different branches such as sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and the one I found most interesting (for obvious reasons): stylistics, which is the linguistic analysis of literary language.Chomsky's various linguistic theories over the years are outlined and it's clear we haven't found a unifying grammar to describe English, let alone all languages. This last is Chomsky's goal, and he's lately put forth the vaguely disturbing theory that children are born with an 'innate' framework of linguistics and then switch on/off different parametres as culture and experience dictate.I found it about half of the book to be extremely readable and accessible, and the other half suddenly dense and technical. Something in between might have been better, but as a first look for a lay person, it was quite good."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I was expecting a more craft-centered/DIY style book and this wasn't it. There are very few projects that are demonstrated. I would have liked more pictures for each section as well, however, the ones that are provided are quite beautiful. Overall I was a little disappointed."
2,Not like the magazine at all,"I wish I hadn't bought this book. I love the magazine so I was hoping that the book would be like a whole bunch of the magazines condensed into one huge helpful book. Unfortunately, that is not the case.There weren't that many pictures with tips and most of the book seems to be a collection of comments on all the weddings Martha and her family and friends have ever had, from her grandmother to daughter to close friends. That was a little odd. The pictures were beautiful but not very helpful. There really weren't too many new ideas or good tips. I was very disappointed.As long as you don't expect this book to be like a condensed version of the magazine, you might like it. I read the whole thing and put it on the shelf. Hopefully I can pass it on to someone who will appreciate it at some point."
5,WORTH THE INVESTMENT,"BEYOND THE BASICS... I love this book! As a compulsive researcher, I wanted as much information as possible when I was planning my wedding. This book goes beyond the basics and covers such topics as having a tent reception, seasonal flowers, preserving photos after the wedding, and so much more. On top of all of the great info, this book is just plain beautiful. It is filled with gorgeous photography and many details. I had my baker recreate a cake from this book, and I also had my caterer use a punch recipe. I just loaned my precious copy out to an engaged friend and I hope she enjoys it as much as I did."
1,Made me sick!!!!,"I ordered this product with high hopes after reading many really good reviews; however it literally made me sick to my stomach! I took the product and 20 minutes later I was doubled over in pain. I tried taking it another time just to make sure and the same thing happened. I am someone who works out 5 days a week, eats a clean diet and drinks about a gallon of water a day. I guess I'm one of the unlucky ones that cannot tolerate it."
5,Amazing,"It's amazing, although I'm on a strict diet too it makes me feel and look better. The only con it has is too many pills and I get too sweaty but it's alright it worth it!"
2,Didn't do much for me,"I used half the can and only saw any difference the first few times I took it.Also, there are way too many pills in each pack. Kind of concerned me a bit."
4,"Not magic, but it helps.","Many people will probably think this product is magic. It isn't, but it does help. I use it during cutting phases, but I do not take it over a 3 week period. I use it when I want to cut my appetite. What this product does for me is:-Cuts appetite-Increased focus-Increases motivation to work outThis product makes you feel a lot like an adderall would, and I've actually used it to help me complete school work, as well as dieting. Good product, worth the money. Its a lot of pills, but its not even that bad. I recommend this product, but you still have to work out and eat healthy to lose weight. It just makes the diet and exercise process easier."
3,"For me, not effective","I took Animal Cuts for a three week cycle as directed.I hit the gym at least three times a week for no lessthan an hour. On the scale, I did not lose one pound.I know that everyone's chemistry is different but forme I lost nothing."
3,Not sure what to say about this,Very distinct odor from the pills. Gross after taste that resembles 'black pepper'. Had to go to the bathroom 5 times every hour. I'm not saying it doesn't burn fat or water weight because it probably does. But it's not worth it because of how it made me feel.
3,A good read but a bit dated,"i liked this book because it was exactly what Brian Tracy said it would be. Still though the exercises in this book are just mundane. Silva Ultra Mind, or Think & Grow Rich all by itself are much better books. This book is good for advanced Law of Attraction practitioners, in my opinion, or those people that need ""strict"" and ""lots"" of work visualizing."
2,Better get an air compressor.,The back pack for this takes alot of air and the gun is very odd. My 5 year old son wore this and I had to hem the bottom about 5 inches up.
3,Great Costume - Inflatables Need Help Though,"This is a unique costume for all of you Ghostbuster lovers out there! Our son really loved being one for Halloween this year. The first order we received; the ""Proton Pack"" inflated just fine and stayed inflated for weeks. However, the gun did not. So I contacted Customer Service and they overnighted the 2nd one right away which was an unexpected but pleasant surprise. With the 2nd order both inflatables did not inflate properly which was a disappointment. At this point we just utilized the ""Proton Pack"" from the first order and bought a laser-like gun at a toy store which worked out better anyway. So in essence yes this is a good costume but the inflatables are yet to be desired. This company provided such courteous and prompt customer service that I will do business with them again since they offer many other costumes to choose from and of course are very easy to deal with in regards to returns/defective products."
1,Try to talk your kid out of it!,"My son is 4 and loves the Ghostbuster song so he wanted to be a Ghostbuster this year. I bought him the size SMALL 4-6 and is recommended for 3-4 year olds. He is very average on his size but this outfit looks like it would fit my 8 year old daughter better. I checked the tag and it said small. There is extra room on the arms, legs and waist. There is about 4-6 inches extra on the arms and about 6-8 inches extra on the legs and the crotch area hangs down to his knees...needless to say, I'm going to either have to roll it up for him, get it hemmed or just get a whole new costume all together. Also, it is made poorly...there are strings hanging off everywhere! I haven't even opened the backpack yet...kind of scared to see what's wrong with it. Don't waste your money!"
4,Who ya gonna call?!!,"I bought this costume for my 3 1/2 year old son. Yes, I had to roll up the pants and sleeves b/c they were too long, but it was so cute and he LOVED it! The blow up proton pack was almost as tall as he was, but again, no problem. It is so cool! My son has been pretending to ""laser"" ghosts for months, and he was so happy to finally be an official Ghostbuster. I showed him the 80s video of the song on YouTube, and he sings almost the whole thing. He got tons of compliments on his get-up; people got quite nostalgic and kept shouting, ""Who Ya Gonna Call?!!"" It's kind of expensive, but I do believe he'll be a Ghostbuster for several Halloweens to come."
3,Cute costume .........Proton Pack is poorly designed,The straps did not stay together on the proton pack...would slip off the back frequently..and the handheld part of the proton pack comes off easily...velcro holds it together...but not well...not for children on the go...be prepaired to fix it a lot while trick or treating in order to keep your kid happy.
3,Olympus has done better,"This is my 3rd olympus camera, the previous ones are 35mm, so this is my first digital. I have always liked this brand cause for the price you pay you get a great camera. My sister has the D-380 and I was very impressed with it. I decided to upgrade and buy the D-390. Kind of dissapointed to find out that halfway the fun the two AA batteries run dead (you wont survive a party without an extra set), the time lapse between one shot and when the camera is ready for another shot is too long, almost 10 seconds. Is hard to catch good images with kids because once you push the button it doesnt take the picture for another 2 seconds, and the timer is harder to program than in other cameras. My recomedation is to purchase de D-380, the previous model, is more user friendly, it holds 4 AA batteries and cheaper. Good Luck"
3,"a decent, interesting read","Now this is an unusual book. It is an interesting read and is different from most of the books that I have read. It is the second novel for Glenn Savan and I would read another. He hasn't quite reached the top yet for me, but he has the ability to get there.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Ok, not great","After reading all the reviews, I was expecting to love this CD. But the music starts to all sound the same. It's Brady's version of Bob Dylan-ish music with kid-like beats and words - but much of it is boring. It's not terrible, and my daughter gets a kick out of some of the words, but all in all, I suggest her other music CDs and I wouldn't recommend someone buy this one."
4,really good,"It's really big and heavy, but very beautiful and unique.Cause it's size, it can't fit in the dishwasher.But except that, it's very gorgeous and practical item for kichen."
3,Interesting commentary on the search world,"Since this book was published a few years ago, the Web game has changed--and so has search. However, I still found the contents an interesting read. The author managed to interview several high-flying Silicon Valley executives, including Sergey Brin and Larry Page, founders of Google. While I don't think that the author's predictions for the future of search have come to pass, it was an interesting commentary on Google, its business practices, and its competitors. Search is a vital part of today's Web, and this particular author appears to be refreshingly aware of the influence and where it could take us in the future."
1,"SERIOUSLY, HOW CAN YOU GIVE MORE THAN 1 STAR?","I just finished 3 years at a reputable 3rd tier.For those of you thinking of purchasing this book, let me just tell you something quickly:Mr. Wellen uses names for his Mommy and his Daddy in his autobiography. He calls his Mommy ""the Oracle"" and his Daddy ""the Optimist."" These names occur in his book about as often as the words 'the' 'and' i.e. alot. Now imagine switching these names back to their original meaning i.e. 'Mommy' and 'Daddy'Now further imagine, someone complaining, whining and crying that they came in 2nd place instead of 1st (out of a rat race of hundreds of thousands).What you are left with: Alex Wellen complaining to mommy and daddy that he isn't at harvard. (If a 3rd tier wrote a book, it would be more compelling and accurate of law school.)Sorry Alex, better luck next lifetime, for now you will have to just settle for $300,000 a year instead of $310,000. And read a real story like 1L"
3,"Carbon Copy Battles, No real intrigue, bring back Stackpole","Oh well, not too bad, but where is the personal touch of individuals with other individuals. Gressman is OK but he's no Stackpole. An oh by the way WHAT the H*LL is happening with Victor Davion????"
5,Great Product & Speedy Service!,"The product is great & and does what it says it will do...:0) After you find the color that suits you, you will be pleased with the results...:0)"
5,Nice New Look!,"My wife has been a redhead ever since I met her about six years ago. Well, it was dyed red and looked real nice. She said it was ""hot."" Well, it made her stand out in a crowd, that's for certain. Her natural hair color is a somewhat ""mousey"" medium brown.Lately she's been dissatisfied with her appearance and asked for my advice. I thought she might look nice as a brunette with a slightly darker shade than her natural color. We went to the pharmacy and picked out a Natural Instincts #20 hazelnut medium brown dye. She loves the new look. Me too. The only problem is that she's now much harder to find in a crowd. However, we're booth very satisfied with the new look and she's going to stay with it for at least two or three years.Gary Peterson"
3,Agree with the bad reviews,"I agree with all the other bad reviews. I used this color several years ago and everyone said how pretty it was and how it made my green eyes ""pop"" I decided to try it again and wow has it changed. Before it was a nice normal brown with a hint of purple undertone. My hair came out this time around very red, I wouldn't even call it brown. The refresh pack indeed is very red as well. Needs to be called red now, not plum. I think I'll have to go buy a brown and put over it and wait for it to wash up. SIGH."
5,Not the spice,My favorite hair color of all time-this is my natural hair color. Easy application. Lasts. Feels soft. Great conditioner included. I use the full 20 munutes.
4,Great Cagney Flick,"This is a great film, classic Cagney. No special effects, just pure acting by the best. Story plot begins in WW1 France, two doughboys, Cagney and Bogart dream of life back home. Down and out in the Twenties after the war, they get involved in bootlegging and other vices. They meet up again back in the States and work together...for a while at least. This movie is worth the small price. Great compared to the garbage that goes up on the screen these days."
5,Anything with Gagney or Bogart is great.,Wish I didn't have to write more to compete this survey. Shucks. Wish I could leave this page before writing the minimum required.
4,A roaring success,"Finding that his old job has been given away, returning World War I vet Eddie Bartlett (James Cagney) takes work as a taxi driver to make ends meet, and soon rises from delivering bootleg liquor to leading his own criminal empire in the days of Prohibition. The corruption of his good nature and the alienation of his war buddies, the slimy George Hally (Humphrey Bogart, still playing heavies at this point) and the stalwart Lloyd Hart (Jeffrey Lynn), pave the way to his eventual downfall. This thrilling crime picture from the heyday of Warner Bros. gangster films is thoroughly entertaining and features a great Cagney death scene."
4,The Roaring Twenties,"I'm a James Cagney Fan and this movie was one of my favorites.If you like ganster movies or James Cagney,I strongly suggest you see this movie"
1,Does not pump grease. What is it for then?,This tool is not usable. The pump suction feed fails whenever you try to use it. I am using synthetic bearing grease and it will not pump it. I think it was designed for use with melted butter maybe? The grease fitting on the end of the hose will not fit standard zerk fittings. I replaced it with one from my manual pump in order to test this thing. The bleeder valve is actually a suction breaker. If you do get the grease pumping under no pressure situation (through an open zerk) it will stop when you push the bleeder valve. I replaced the bleeder valve with a plug to insure it was not opening during the test. I would never buy this product again and I am surprised it is still on the market.
4,Bissell 3594,"Not the best, but you can't go wrong for your money. We have a home cleaning business, we have tried other brands, they do not hold up as well, nor do as good a job. The only thing you need to do is clean the filters, wash out and dry regularly. This is another great feature, you do not have to buy replaceable filters. Good value for your money."
2,"ok, i guess","sounds like a great concept, that's why I bought it. It's the darn canister that has to be emptied all the time. Then you have to wash out all the parts... and wait for them to air dry.... I'm sure I get more dust in the air with this thing than the old fashioned bags.oh well..... live and learn."
1,Another Bissell Failure,"I got about 20 house sweepings out of this thing before it broke down. I also previously got a bissell steam cleaner and I got 2 cleanings out of it before it broke down. Both products did fine while they were still working, but if you plan to live more than 6 months - DON'T BUY BISSELL."
4,"Very good, downright excellent for the price","This purchase was definitely a good value! Previously, we only had a cheap $40 vacuum from Wal-Mart and well, let's just say that we got what we paid for. Consequently, by the time we got this one, we were in dire need of a good vacuuming! This machine works like a champ - picks up pet litter, dirt, hair, and whatever else (I don't want to know) ends up in the carpet. Even areas that are badly soiled or stained look considerably cleaner after thorough vacuuming and it has worked like a champ despite lots of hair and other clogging opportunities in our home. The canister is easy to remove, empty and replace, and the tools work pretty well also. We are very happy with ours and recommend it to anyone who wants a good value for their money."
3,ok but not great,I loved volume one so I thought I should try volume 2. It is ok but her descriptions are difficult to follow. I find myself having to look at the screen when I am in odd positions to see what she is doing next. She using mostly basic yoga moves but she does not call them correctly. I will do this workout throughout the pregnancy but not as much as volume 1.
2,WAY too long!!!,Have been doing intensive yoga now for several years. Was looking for a more moderate version during my pregnancy. This yoga flow is nearly 2 hours long - way too long for me when I am tired! And very repetetive. I now just go to the last 20 minutes and complete some of the stretches good for pregnancy.
2,Hoped for better,"I really don't want to give a bad review, but unfortunately have to.I am now 20 weeks into my pregnancy, and still work out regularly (jogging, swimming, pilates, yoga, dance...all of which I did previously). I bought this DVD in conjunction with The Perfect Pregnancy Workout 1. Considering the fitness experience of the instructor (former acrobat for Cirque) I hoped that it would be a challenging workout that adhered to the safety needs of a pregnant woman. I was disappointed.While safety is definitely addressed (in the intro), the workout is lacking. Instruction during the workout is poor and the yoga moves lack flow and organization. Beginners would have trouble following the workout, while advanced exercises will fail to find this much of a workout.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this dvd. If you are wanting to try out one of the Perfect Pregnancy series, Volume 1 is a better purchase."
2,Too much for 3rd Trimester,I was looking for a more relaxed workout to ease my sore joints. This DVD was way to much for my 3rd trimester body. She moves so quickly that your body just can't adjust. It left me lightheaded and disappointed that I couldn't keep up. I prefer Shiva Rea's yoga DVD.
2,Not a Fan,"When you put this yoga DVD in, you better know what you're doing without looking and be ready to rush. The instruction is lacking and the split screen view for beginner and advanced makes for some tough viewing. I've been doing yoga for years, and this is one of the least energizing/relaxing videos I've done--and those are two things that should be a GIVEN for prenatal yoga!!For a feel good parental workout I prefer the Prenantal/Postnatal Workout (from Element) and Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout."
3,Not my favorite but it will do,"I used to be a Yoga regular but haven't been in awhile. I got this video based on the reviews. It was ok. It is actually fast paced so you don't get the stretching you would expect. The moves were quite easy. I wasn't prepared to hear her tell me to ""kegel"" and didn't think that is typically a yoga move, but I went with it!"
5,nice feeling,This workout is truly wonderful.. Both for beginners and advanced exercisers. During and after it leaves you with a nice feelingand of course it keeps you fit..
1,Not Really Yoga,"She goes way too fast! I have been doing beginner/moderate yoga for years, and my body yearned for it when I was pregnant! I needed to stretch to relieve my muscles and get pressure off of my joints. THIS WAS NOT THE VIDEO I NEEDED!! She moves through the moves so quickly it's hard to even enjoy the stretch. Plus it's really short, and not all that challenging. I had high hopes since her sisters workout was SO good! The only reason this even gets a star is because I was able to resell it on Amazon for $20. I would not recommend this. For good stretching yoga that relieves the body, I use Suzanne Deason Yoga Conditioning. Some people don't like her because she's too easy--but it totally makes my body feel better."
4,Hanging On To Max Book Review,"Sam had everything in life; he was popular with friends, as well with the ladies. He was a strong athlete and nothing had gone wrong since the death of his mother. He was in love with his beautiful girlfriend, Brittany, and everything was perfect between the two of them untill he got her pregnant.It was the best book that i have ever read. It kept me hanging on, and i did not want to put the book down. I loved how even though it was hard for Sam to be a single parent, he loved his son so much that he would take on that respnsibility for him. He stopped buying things for himself and put all of his money towards his son."
5,Excellent Book for Beginners,"I'm finding this book useful, practical, and empowering. Not only do the authors explain how your car works, they describe how to do the work yourself or seek a mechanic's services confidently. The book is easy to read, yet doesn't talk down to the reader."
3,Unnecssary Dumbing Down,"A car repair book for women, filled with plenty of pictures and basic instructions. Sometimes the information was too simple - like the section on putting gas in your car.There are better books, like ""Recipes For Car Care,"" which offer simplified information without mocking the reader's intelligence."
2,"Some good, some bad.","Some parts of this book are helpful, but other parts act as if women don't know what a car is. There is a section that explains how to open your trunk...seriously? If you can't figure out how to open your trunk, you shouldn't be driving.If you're a woman wanting to learn more about cars, find another book."
2,"Disappointing lack of information, too dumbed down","I was excited about this book, and the first few sections about how things work seemed helpful. However, a lot of the diagrams are confusing because not everything that they talk about is labelled or shown, and they try to dumb down explanations so much that you can't even understand what they're saying or how things work.It doesn't help you if you want to do repairs at home, as you're repeatedly told you take your car to a mechanic.Some of the information is incorrect, too."
5,"brilliant, assured work","i watched THESIS last night, i thought it was brilliant. such an assured thriller, makes all the right moves and never trips up. the pacing is the work of a master, who knows how work their audience. plus the occasional comic relief is welcome and never out of place with the rest of the film. the dvd was a bit dark though, and isn't the best-looking picture i've seen, but still, the film is a killer you can't complain. definitely one of the more satisfying thrillers i've seen of late."
4,Mexican horo,"Tesis es una buena película. No podría entender mucha de las discusiones por que los caracteres eran obviamente españoles y pensé que hablaron demasiado rápido. La buena cosa es ellos actuaba bastante buena que podría entender todo que se occuró. La película está sobre un estudiante del cine, Angela, que se esté siguiendo como cinco hombres. Pienso que ella mata a tres de ellos. La película tenía muchas imágenes asustadizas de personás muriendo. Mi parte favríto de la película era cuando el psycho tenía su cara en la entrepierna de Angela y entonces él puso un cuchillo en ella pero era justo un sueño. Eso me asustó. Tengo gusto de los dos actores que jugaron Chema y el psycho porque eran los mismos actores en ""Abre Los Ojos"" y ellos eran buenos en ése también. Doy a esta película dos pulgares para arriba."
4,Tesis por Alejandro Amenábar,"Esta pelicula me parece muy interesante. Visualmente la es como una pelicula de horror de los estados unidos, pero el dialogo esta en espanol. Alejandro Amenábar quiso hacer una pelicula como esto, y el tuvo exito. Este es una de las mejores peliculas del mundo latino americano. La disfrute mucho pero solamente voy a darla cuatro estrellas porque pienso que la cuantidad de violencia fue muchisima."
5,Awesome Shirt,The shirt is a Quality USA Made item. My son loves it and wishes there were more color choices. Awesome
5,rit's house is a great place to hang out!,"This is the first lee ritenour cd i've owned. It was a Christmas gift, and honestly it's all I've listened to in the car since then. It's truly astounding. There is not a bad track on the entire cd, while I do think the Michael McDonald vocal is a little unbalanced on the whole. I would've preferred to hear that song done as an instrumental. Regardless, I am most impressed with ritenour's talent in playing compostions by others and his own songwriting. The opening and closing tracks on the cd are original, and both are compelling and addictive. Whether you're new to lee ritenour or an old fan, this cd is a must-have in your collection!"
2,Not designed for X50/X50V,"Case is nice, but much too large for the X50V. Belt clip is nice and magnet enclosure works well, but my X50V just sloshes around in this case and none of the holes line up... Amazon and Belkin need to update description to state which EXACT model this fits."
4,Awesome convenience with little hassle,"I recently purchased this coffee maker and find it to be the best pot I've ever owned. The stainless steel pot is sturdy and keeps the coffee ""hot"" for a long period of time without theburned taste you sometimes get with glass pots that sit on a warmer. Its easy to use with convenience grind recepticle andwater fill section. The unit is on the tall side but fits under my cabinets. I just pull it forward when brewing and back after its done. As an added bonus the coffee tasts great. I like strong coffee and Zojirushi brews a consistently good rich cup of coffee using non-specialty brands."
1,not worth the price,"i brought this coffee maker last year , and last year i had to send it back because it would not finish brewing. so they made send back the broken one and a couple of weeks later i received it, well the coffee maker is not working again , and its the same thing the dang cofee maker will not finish brewing, its like i have to turn it on 4 times for it to finish brewing. i really think for the price of this maker we should not be having these kind of problems, so i would say to anyone thinking of buying this dont!!!look elsewhere , its not worth it."
1,Unreliable coffeemaker,"We were very happy with this coffee maker when we first purchased it.Unfortunately, our experience has already been described here. After about 6-8 months of use the coffee maker won't brew an entire pot. It constantly switches off. We have to stand by the machine and continue pushing the on button about 10 times to get a full pot.This has become incredibly exasparating and we will be replacing it with a brand that has a more reliable track record."
4,Zojirushi 10 cup Coffee Maker,"On the plus side, the Zojirushi makes a really good cup of coffee -- better and hotter than many other standard drip coffee makers. It's also stylish, and easy to clean.On the downside -- and it's a big downside -- the design of the drip mechanism is seriously flawed. The hole from the bottom of the coffee cone MUST PRECISELY match up with the hole in the top of the carafe, else, the coffee just simply pours out of the bottom of the cone and all over your counter. It's a real mess! Being off-center even just a millimeter results in coffee all over the counter & not in the carafe.The designers of this Zojirushi coffee maker need to take a cue from the designers of the Mr. Coffee coffee maker: allow more space between the bottom of the coffee cone and the top of the coffee carafe/pot."
3,"Good, but ultimately flawed.","I've been living with the Zojirushi for about a year now and have a love/hate relationship with it. I think it makes an above average cup of coffee and it keeps it hot enough to drink for hours without altering taste if you preheat the pot with hot water.I have two complaints. The first is a major one - this coffee pot leaks. Often. You must perfectly line up the thermal carafe with the top part or you will come back to a massive mess all over the countertop and floor. The fact that the pot doesn't beep to tell you it is done brewing can exasterbate the problem. The second gripe is that you usually have to trim the filters in order to have them fit properly - and thus reducing the chance of the leak I just mentioned.That said, I don't dislike it enough to spend another ~$100 on another pot, but I don't think I would purchase it again.In the end, it is a good machine, and a very good value, but ultimately flawed."
1,Buy a different coffee maker,"This coffee maker was highly rated when I bought it. God knows why. I has a red ball that indicates the amount of water you have added. It is almost invisible because there is minimal contrast to the black background. The coffee basket isn't sized properly. I need to make several folds into a #4 coffee filter to get it to fit. The Mr. Coffee style filters don't fit either. The thermal carafe really doesn't keep the coffee warm for very long. The screw top on the carafe is very difficult to remove and gets stuck easily. There is always water or coffee on the stand underneath the carafe so when you set it down on any surface, be prepared to wipe up after you've set it down. I believe these are made and apparently designed in China. They don't know anything about coffee makers. I've heard that Cuisinart makes a good coffee maker. I'm going to buy one of those. I've owned a few Krups brand and they're very good, too."
5,Great thermos coffee brewer,"I bought this after being at a freinds house where they had a Starbucks Thermos style coffee maker. After not seeing one of them at a Starbucks, I came to my favorite Shopping place-Amazon. the reviews for this machine are very good, so I bought one. They do take and recommend #4 filters. Some comments, said water temp was a problem, so I set up the coffee the evening before, so the water comes to room tempreture, which I don't really think is an issue, but it sure makes life easier waking to a fresh pot of coffee. And we just love this machine. easy to clean,easy to use and it makes great coffee and so far, keeps the coffee HOT at least for 3 hours. We used to have Brauns, but this is terrific and highly recommend it."
4,Good purchase,"We purchased this carafe pot over a month ago, and have found it to be very satisfactory. It brews fast, keeps coffee hot for hours, and looks good on the countertop. Can't find any faults with it, other than the bulky paper filter, but I guess a permanent filter can be purchased. Still looking for the ideal amount of coffee, and right blend, but closing in. Very fast delivery by Amazon, and packaged well."
1,Not Even a Single Cup,"I was very disappointed with the Fresh Brew. The first time I ran water through the unit, to flush it as recommended, the water leaked and permeated the electronics. The end. I sent the unit back and purchased a Krups Thermal Carafe which is a much more solidly constructed machine than the Zojirushi, and has lots of great features."
2,Frustrated,"I read hundreds of reviews before deciding on this coffee maker. It seems that nobody cares about making a quality product anymore.The first issue was that it was not delivered on the date promised, even though I paid for expedited delivery.When I did receive it, it was packed very well and appeared in good condition. I love the look and size of this maker. Tall and sleek, it takes up much less room than my last.It worked great for THREE DAYS!After reading all the great reviews of this product, I am very frustrated. I have just repacked and shipped back to Amazon and will not be replacing with the same product or through Amazon. I feel like I have wasted a lot of time and still don't have a coffee maker.I did give two stars because of the look of the product and that it worked well when it worked. Maybe I just got a lemon?"
1,My Experience,"Made one mug of coffee, which was fine and the next time I used it water leaked profusely from the measuring gauge. Thus I cannot recommend this machine."
2,Unhappy with quality!,"I bought this coffee maker 8 months ago after reading the reviews. Well, it didn't live up to the hype. The base of the carafe just fell off. I can get it to stay on while it's brewing but it just falls off again. Also, I don't like the way you have to twist the top to pour the coffee. Sometimes it gets stuck and I have a hard time opening it. Not worth the money!"
3,Nice design - Ordinary tasting coffee.,"Pros:Stylish attractive stainless steel finish.High quality vacuum carafe that maintains the temperature.Easy to use clock and timer.East to clean.Cons:Brewing temperature could be hotter.#4 filter is 1/4"" too tall and wrinkles.I am not a connoisseur of fine coffee. When brewing I use 1 tablespoon of Folders for two cups of coffee. I make 8 cups each morning, drink two at home and take six to the office in my Nissan Thermos bottle. I bought this coffee maker because it has a vacuum carafe and recieved good reviews. The one I received doesn't live up to the high reviews. It doesn't extract as much flavor, from the common coffee I use, as my Cusinart does. It is a stylish coffee maker that looks good, doesn't use much counter space, keeps coffee hot, and makes an ordinary tasting cup of coffee. I rate -1/2 star for poor fitting filter and -1 1/2 star for ordinary coffee strength."
4,Good Stuff!,"This is a great machine which produces HOT coffee, very quickly. One tip I learned the hard way: After setting the timer, don't forget to remove the stopper on the carafe. If you do forget, you will find coffee all over the floor the next morning. bummer."
4,The carafe is great to keep it fresh!,"I bought this coffee maker because I wanted one of those steel carafes that doesn't keep cooking the coffee - and this one works beautifully in that regard. It's a bit tall, so you have to pull it out from under the cabinet. The dang filters are no big deal, some folks were saying they have to cut them, or they don't fit, maybe if your a bit obsessive about perfectly fitting coffee filters, but that isn't as much of an issue as how tall the thing is. The coffee stays hot for several hours as long as the lid is screwed on tight. I don't like the little cap thing you have to put on so no heat escapes, it should be connected to the pot or something, we're constantly having to find a place to plunk it down without it getting in the way and the pot won't fit back on the coffee maker after that little lid is on, but I guess they figure IT DOESN'T HAVE TO, you can take it RIGHT to the table because there is not hot pad to keep cooking it - so that much is true :)"
2,It's A Coffee Pot,"Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said pro and con.I will say first of all, don't buy this coffee maker, it's way to expensive for the pros that you'll get.Does it make a drinkable cup of coffee, yes it does, but not to be compared to a press pot.The coffee does not stay hot near as long as they claim, maybe 20 minutes.The coffee does not taste the same after 20 minutes like they claim.I would not pay $75 to $100 dollars for this maker, maybe $30.Buy a Mr Coffee maker, it's just as good.Want the best cup of coffee, get a press pot, the only draw back is that you can't keep it fresh very long, and you can't make a lot of it at once.If it's just you and your significant other, get a 12 cup Bodum Press Pot, boil your water and get quality coffee beans and enjoy.Save your money on this maker, it's way over rated."
4,Great Machine,"I was surprised at the improvement in the taste of the same bag of coffee from the new machine vs. the old one.It is a good looking machine and simply functions as you'd expect. It was more than others in this category, but seems to be good price/performance ratio.Very minor comments/complaints:1. The carafe is a bit thinner than our old Cusinart (worst performer ever), so it doesn't keep coffee hot too long2. The red LED lights are a dated look (I would have expected black) and stands out at night when lights are off3. There is a removable cap that plugs the top cover -- it is the same diameter as our sink drain and easy to lose track of (especially with 2 and 4-year boys). Since the cap is a two-piece design, it is possible to brew a pot with the cap in place, which will result in coffee all over the counter!I sure would love an all-steel constuction machine at the $100 price point that works this good..."
4,Fine coffee maker and without a couple of the problems noted by others,"This was a replacement for a Cuisinart that started leaking after a couple of years. Despite the comment made by ""bev_from_RI"", this takes #4 cone filters, not #3. In fact, Melita doesn't even make #3 filters. They are a tad taller than the basket, but I didn't need to cut them down. This coffee maker has a pivoting spray arm that is supposed to move to the center of the basket automatically when the lid closes after you fill it with water, but it tends to hang up on the filter, so move it by hand after filling the resevoir...don't count on the ""automatic"" pivoting mechanism. Other than that, it's fine. Yes, the lid flips up rather than out, so you'll need to slide the maker out from underneath the cabinet to fill it with water, but I do that anyway and only store the maker under the cabinet when I'm done with it for the day. The carafe does a fine job retaining heat."
1,great while it lasted,this coffee maker made an outstanding cup of coffee and kept it hot for a long time (hours). Too bad it died after eight weeks. Just stopped brewing.
1,sucks,this coffee maker is very tricky to use. if you do not have the carafe in the correct position there will be coffee everywhere
1,Coffee maker failed two months after warranty expired.,The electronics in this coffee maker failed completely shortly after the warranty expired. We were very happy with the coffee it produced until it stopped working.
1,save your money for something else,"I bought this coffee maker, because some people gave it high recommendation here. I think I wasted my money.It worked only for a couple of days. Finally, it just stopped working and I had to push the button at least three times in order to collect a small cup of coffee. That is ridiculous for an expensive coffee maker priced at $80 above. It makes me feel that this Japanese coffee maker is like Sony-made products, having a fancy looking but lousy quality.Save your money for some other coffe makers, and avoid this one."
1,Not too thrilled! Unit doesn't brew coffee.,"I waited for two weeks for the Zoji to finally arrive. Conducted my due diligence... researched Amazon web site, etc... then selected what I thought was the best value for my needs. But the unit we received is defective so it's going back to Amazon (who, by the way, are easy to deal with on defective returns within 30 days). I was going to rate this item a bit higher but I need to be fair about this so it gets one star for non-performance and unreliability. It's plugged-in, and instructions followed- it just won't pump water or brew coffee. Very disappointing after a 14-day wait for it to arrive."
4,Coffee Maker -- Works for Me,"I've had this coffee maker for about a month now. It seems to do the job. I haven't had the issues that other reviewers have complained about, aside from the filters not fitting properly. I looked for #3 filters that some reviewers recommended, but can't find anyone who makes a #3. I've been cutting some off the #4's. This takes care of the problem without much hassle. The coffee stays hot for a reasonable time period. The plastic is a bit flimsy. I have not used the programmable timer. I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3,Works but a little funky,"The coffee's fine. But a couple other things bugged me so much that I gave my EC-BD15 away. First, it's very tall, and kind of, well, stork-like in appearance. In addition, in order to put water in, you open a flap on the top which increases the total height another seven inches or so. It's a skyscraper. Second, with the lid/top on the carafe of brewed coffee, the carafe will no longer fit in its home port in the coffee maker -- there's not enough room because the lid makes the carafe taller -- too tall. Those two factors bugged me: the machine is too tall and odd looking, and the carafe cannot be put back in the machine with its lid on. The coffee was fine."
1,Overflows frequently and not reliable,"The first one we ordered stopped working within a year. Since it made a decent cup of coffee, we ordered a replacement thinking that we'd have better luck with durability the second time around. Well, the second one stopped working within six months. An expensive piece of junk."
3,Good price but not the best.,"This is the first thermal coffee maker I've purchased or used. I like the idea of having a hot cup coffee without the bitter taste that comes from sitting on a warming plate. The first time brewing a pot with this unit did produce a nice hot pot after following the manufacturers directions. After the 3rd pot however, the coffee came out a little less warmeer each time. I tried warming the inside of the carafe with hot water and using luke warm water to brew with. Now I had hot coffee again but why should I have to go through all that when the machine is supposed to make hot coffee in the first place. Another dislike for me is how hard it is to turn the top to the pour position once brewing is done. This is a very stylish looking pot but not a very good coffee maker. I ordered the Melitta 46894 to replace this unit. So far so good."
1,Bad experience,"Unfortunately, 5 weeks after purchasing this product, it completely stopped functioning. When turned on, NOTHING happens. The heating element appearsto have failed. To make matters worse, I've been in contact with the seller (Dynadirect. com) through email to try and exchange the machine or get it repaired, and they have not responded to my 3 emails. Therefore, I would NOT recommend this item."
1,Very weak coffee!!,I just can not get a strong cup of coffee regardless of the amount of coffee grinds and the filter.I regret buying this coffee maker.
1,Stopped Working After Six Months,"I'm on my second one of these. The first worked fine for a long time, but fell on the floor and some of the plastic cracked, but it still worked. Since I liked it, I ordered a new one and threw the old one away. After six months it's totally dead. The heating element no longer heats. I opened it up and checked the over-temperature sensor and it's fine, and then I checked the resistance of the heater and it's an open circuit.Now I make coffee by manually pouring water over the grinds. This works for now. Looking for a better unit that has a thermal carafe. Probably will buy the $40 Cuisinart at Costco. At least it has a three year warranty.I'm disappointed in Zojirushi these days. I had one of their water boilers fail after only two years. The bread machine still works fine though."
3,"""Adequate"" and that's about it...","I read some complaints about the lid and it being ""frustrating' to open. I do not find that to be the case, but is is difficult to see the open position in the early morning light.The bigger issues in my opinion are:1) If you forget to put the lid on the carafe when brewing (which is not difficult - I've done it a couple times now) you get a huge mess!!2) The stainless steel carafe acts as a heat sink, basically cooling down the coffee rather than keeping it hot! This is not an issue unique to Zojirushi. I suggest going with a coffee maker that has a plastic insullated carafe which is far superior.I do not typically write product reviews but felt compelled based on my disappointment of a coffee maker at this price level."
5,Best Coffee Maker I've Owned,"I'll keep this short. I like this coffee maker because: the carafe keeps the coffee warm most of the day and what's left over can be heated in the microwave the next day and still tastes quite good. Works perfectly, doesn't drip, good overall quality. Happy to own this machine!"
2,carafe has to be placed just right or it leaks,I like the warm coffee in the thermal carafe but if you have the carafe off center it leaks!
2,The heating element died after only 6 months !,"The heating element died after only 6 months !At least they referred me to a local service provider, five minutes from my house (hence an extra star).Still very disappointed, considering that a coffeemaker I had, 1/5 of the price of this one, lasted 5 times longer !!"
3,Great Appliance But Short Lived,"Super coffeemaker. Makes great coffee, but not for long!! Had our machine exactly 14 months before it stopped working. We're told we need to send it off to California (we live in NY) and wait 2-3 weeks for them to determine if it's a ""minor issue"" or not. Still getting details. Not good for someone who is a major caffeine addict! If it were more reliable, I'd give it five stars. (Sigh)"
1,zojirushi coffee maker,"i have had one of these coffee makers for many years.works great and is still working great.i bought a new one recently for a condo i had purchased at the beach.it quit working after about five brews.it was still under warranty.no problem getting them to have it fixed,but i had to shell out another $15.00 to have it sent to one of their authorized repair shops in the u.s..my complaint about the whole deal is that i think i should be reimbursed for the shipping cost especially since this machine is one of the more expensive ones to buy!oh well,made in china like most everything else is.so,if you buy this particular brand be prepared to spend extra cash if something goes wrong with it!"
1,Coffee all over the counter!,"I have had this coffee maker for about 2 years. It is loud but makes good coffee under normal conditions. The problem comes when you inevitably forget to put the lid back on after pouring the water in from the carafe and press the brew button. When this happens you come back to coffee and grounds all over the counter and floor. While it might sound easy enough to just remember to put the lid on, over the past 2 years this has happened to me at least 10 times. If you have a great memory then this may work well for you. Personally, I am going to buy another coffee maker that doesn't stress me out. Drinking coffee is supposed to be an enjoying experience and this coffee maker has ruined that experience for me for the last time."
1,It only makes coffee; can it possibly be worth this much?,"Only uou can answer;put in good coffee product; it will make good coffee, keeping it drinkably hot surprisingly long.You are making ice coffee; buy another. Bonus: Though not an ornament, most find it inoffensive, if not attractive, on the counter. No problem to report; ours has worked well for two years. Just bought another as a birthday present for my sister;they are still becoming aquainted."
3,"Nice BUT,,,,,,,",This would receive 5 stars if the basket was truely stainless steel as it appears in photos. The basket and the water drip are both plastic and will leach over time with the heated water. I don't mind paying for quality but this is an average plastic coffee maker with a stainless carafe which I can only hope is safe.
2,Zojirushi subpar,"I have had the Zojirushi coffee maker for over 6 months now. If I had it to do over again, I'd purchase a different brand of coffee maker. Here's why: The lid on the carafe is too difficult to open and once open the coffee pours out too slowly. The coffee holder must be placed a certain way or you'll wake up to counters and floors full of spilled coffee. If even a little bit of coffee overflows the filter it is certain to clog the carafe and once again, counters and floors are running over with coffee. My opinion is that the Zojirushi is overpriced, under-engineered, and not a great choice."
1,Poorly made. Looks junky. Overflows!,"Filter basket overflows. Except for the carafe, the coffee maker is poorly made and looks like a pice of junk. Rickety! Carafe only keeps coffee luke warm : (. Love Zojirushi's rice makers. Unfortunately, they need to stay out of the coffee maker market."
3,Mixed Opinions after 15 months,"I have mixed feelings on this coffee maker. There are some great things - great tasting coffee - hot and freshly brewed into a thermal carafe - and some horrible things.Even after all this time, what are the engineers thinking on the lid on that carafe? You brew up some coffee, then you have to twist the top to be able to pour. A simple twist of about 30 degrees on a screwtop lid. But sometimes the hot carafe just can't be opened with bare hands. I feel like a complete weakling trying to get this open sometimes. There just isn't enough to grab on to.The other thing - this one is horrible. Sometimes, the coffee just won't go into the carafe. Why? I don't know exactly, but the flow is faster from the coffee than the carafe can accept. Now what happens - coffee all over the floor!I'm using a gold tone filter and the coffee is great, but I guess I just don't know what is wrong with the design of this. I know that everyone else loves this unit, but I just don't love it!"
2,Never hot enough,"We bought this machine a year ago and have kept it because we paid so much for it. Sure it is easy to use, but the coffee is never hot enough. Within the first 15 min of it being made it is sort of hot, never piping hot, and an hour after it is made it is only warm. Today the twist on top to the carafe broke and we are so happy to have an excuse to buy a new coffee maker. For sure it will NOT be a Zojirushi."
1,Zojirushi EC-BD15BA Fresh Brew Theraml Carafe Coffe Maker,"I've always been happy and satisfied with Zojirushi product but not this one. The carafe's lid design is poor. It is generally difficult to open (not enough edge overhang to hold the lid to turn), but worst of all it traps water in cleaning and there is no way to flush it out. No matter how much you shake at every possible angle, the water never comes out or drains out. Very bad design. I want to return it but decided to keep it because of the shipping charge I'm responsible for."
1,Awkward and annoying,"I've had this coffee maker for 6 months now. I can't recommend it. Why?There are so many awkward things about it.1) The basket is not easy to seat. You have to continually turn it until it finds its right place.2) If you don't seat the basket correctly, the water overflows in the basket and you have grounds and coffee all over the counter.3) The carafe must be seated exactly. If it's a 16th of an inch off center the water again overflows and ditto to #1.4) It's not easy to see the little red ball that indicates the water level.5) The carafe is awkward to pour. It spits and sputters whether full or almost empty. Ergonomically, it is the worst I've seen.6) Items 1 - 3 happen about once every two weeks; 4 & 5 happen every time.7) I recommend you look elsewhere. I preferred my Mr. Coffee for $15."
1,Broke in less than 90 days DO NOT BUY,"I have a ""Zojirushi EC-BD15 Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker"" from Amazon.com on December 13, 2004. At first the unit worked well and we were very happy with it. In the past week the unit has stopped working. Seems that it starts to brew and stops before the pot is completely brewed. Most times it only brews one or two cups and stops brewing. If we start brewing again it well brew another one or two cups and then stop again. I can no longer brew a complete pot.I can no longer return is since it's past Amazon's 30-day return policy. I have contacted the manufacturer, but their offices are in Japan so I cannot imagine I'll be sending it to them for exchange. So I'm stuck with a $70 piece of junk."
3,I miss my old coffee maker,"I must admit that I'm disappointed with this coffee maker. The design is a bit cumbersome, and like other reviewers I think the carafe lid is a bit hard to open. The lid also makes the coffee pour really slowly. Coffee tastes good, but I don't think it's hot enough. I do love that this has no hot plate, and the carafe does keep the coffee warm for a while."
2,Design is apparently not fully thought through.,"Great unit until you get to the carafe. The carafe top is difficult to turn, and you have to turn it if you want coffee. The carafe doesn't cleanly engage with the filter basket, if you don't precisely place it. The carafe, when closed will leak if someone tries to pour coffee. The carafe top requires a separate top to seal the hole so the coffee doesn't cool off. But the seal isn't tight, so coffee can leak out if someone tries to pour it and the carafe top is in the ""closed"" position. Overall the carafe system is unnecessarily difficult and awkward to use. So much so we had to return ours.The rest of the unit is beautifully designed. Timer. Controls on the side (where spillage won't seep in). Water level indicator. Thermal carafe (so coffee doesn't get ruined by overheating, yet stays warm. It's as though the designers just didn't complete the job, and the unit was produced prematurely.This should be a 5 star unit."
1,Zojirushi EC-BD15BA Fresh Brew - poor performer,The Zojirushi EC-BD15BA Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee maker purchased in August 2010 was a problematic performer from day one. The basket mechanism had early on occasional overflows which became routine overflows from the basket base. The carafe top does not align well with the basket mechanism and contributes to the ongoing problem with inconsistent flow/blockage from the basket unit to the carafe. Yet another very messy coffee/grounds overflow at month 10 of ownership was one malfunction too many - the Zojirushi EC-BD15BA is not reliable and appears to have mechanical problems that make the unit a poor performer. A very disappointing purchase.
4,No SS basket,Bought based on CR review of thermos style coffeemakers. A good unit but did not recieve the stainless steel coffee basket that is mentioned in operating manual and no info on how to order one. Should it have come with one?
1,Horrible Luke Warm Coffee,Terrible coffee maker! Coffee is luke warm within an hour of brewing. Get the Cuisinart [...]instead. Coffee is still HOT in the Cuisinart 6 hours after brewing.
1,2 strikes and you are out,This seemed to be the only coffee maker I could find with a cone filter and thermal carafe. Bought it and loved it until it died 16 months later. So I bought another one since everybody can have quality control issues. The second one died after 8 months. I won't buy a third - sorry guys; somebody else can have my money.
2,"""Close But No Cigar""","Steinberg came up with an interesting plot idea. However, his writing ability isn't strong enough to cause you to care about the characters and ,more importantly, about the outcome of the story. Overall, I'd rate The Gemini Man as ""fair""."
3,Not much use to non US testers,"While this is a well put together book, it's reliance on the US IRS Tax Form for all examples, makes it doubtful that anyone not familiar with the form will gain much. This book is probably fine for a US Citizen, but for the rest of the world, his other books are far more accessible."
2,Very hard to follow and needs some more examples,"I tend to agree with all of the above reviews regarding this book. I am attempting to read this book at present and find it very difficult to understand how the different test models apply in the real world. I use to test setup for a major computer company. I am guessing that Chapter 8, Syntax Testing, or Chapter 9, Finite-State Testing, would apply. But I need more than the brief introductory paragraphs to know which one applies: Ch 8 - ""Syntax testing is a powerful technique for testing command-driven software and similar applications. It is easy to do and is supported by commercial tools"". vs Ch 9 - ""Originally motivated by hardware logic testing, the finite-state machine model is an excellent model for testing menu-driven applications."" The material in the chapters is thorough but dry."
3,"Maybe I'm crazy, but . . .","... I just don't understand all these glowing reviews. Very pedestrian writing. Stilted dialog. Two-dimensional characters. I will admit that it was nicely paced and the plot was fairly tight, though, frankly, I had figured out the real murderer early on. That never bothers me, though, if the thing is well-written. This was not."
1,Anything for a buck,"Don't expect your version of Quicken to last long. Unlike almost all other software developers, the folks at Quicken seem to look for ways to make their product out of date so they have to be repurchased. And then they don't even offer upgrades, you have to buy the whole thing over again. Avoid getting into this system. If you do, plan on renewing it ever couple years at a high cost."
4,Review of QuickBooks Premier Edition 2007,"For the most part, this update is helpful. It still does not present a format for statements that, to my mind, works well in a church. There is confusion on the part of statement recipients when their statement reflects a negative balance due to paying in more than pledged or making donations without a pledge.Moving into a new program always presents challenges. I feel confident that, after a few more months, it will be more easily used. The support system works reasonably well."
4,An excellent story told from various veiw points,"I found this story to very interesting and attention grabbing. I did not read the book, but listened to it on tape which made it even more intriging because they told the story from two perspectives ( a white voice and a black voice). This story told life from various aspects such as the life of blacks in the rural south, those of blacks in up north, and those of whites in the south. It showed different time frames and what time can do to an environment and the changes that are made as far as race and sexism. It potrayed African Americans as whites viewed them in the 1950's which is inferior. As time moved on, instead of blacks working for whites, they worked with whites and voiced their minds more as the story progressed into more modern days."
4,really great book,"taking from the life of emmitt till, she weaves a great story similar in nature, tugs at your heart and makes you angry all at once"
1,This was a lot of money wasted,This was my 9 year old's big Christmas present and it broke the same day he opened it. :( I feel bad for giving him a cheap present and he feels bad for breaking it. What a bummer.
3,musket gun,this is a very good fake civil war weapon yet it has its flaws. The flaws are the gun would not fire the caps and when it came in from the mail it had a ton of wood chips in it
1,Tennessee Sax,Always considered Merle as a great musician until this. Sings out of tune so much it is embarassing. Merle stick to what you konw! What amazes me is hoe someting this bad got released. It is so out of tune it is embarassing.
3,Comments really should be required to post,Comments really should be required to post. Rating the product should be sufficient for anyone to make a determination as to whether or not they liked the product.
5,"Once started, couldn't put it down....","Well written account of a true story. Mr. Olsen really did his homework on this one. Maybe if the prosecutors had the info available to them that he collected for this story, Stutzman would have been put away before his (alleged) killing spree began to gather steam. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Olsen's books!"
3,too much information,"I really like Gregg & he is really good with his fans, I have all of his books, but he just gave too much information in the book. He described some of the things Eli did with his lovers which I really did need to read about. His lovers were not female. And he didn't give information that was needed. And even tho there were pictures in the book there should have been more. Do not buy this book because of me because Gregg is really good & so are all of his other books. If you don't mind reading about what gay men do you will really like this book."
1,Higly disaappointed,"The book was an insult to my intelligence, besides being poorly written and spiral bound, they Put in copied black and white photos, Why? They served no purpose. I felt I had really been ripped off, then to add insult to injury, I get a bumper sticker and a pen so I can advertise, Hunh? Where are they comming from?"
5,awesome case,"Great case for underwater pictures. We bought this prior to our honeymoon in Tahiti and so glad we did. The underwater pictures we brought home were spectacular and fun to take & show off.It's a bit difficult to see the LCD screen underwater but I think that was more due to my mask than the case itself.Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who frequents vacation destinations with water!"
5,Better than I expected,"There are plenty of instructional DVDs for Rock and electric guitar, but not a ton of stuff for acoustic guitar. I don't have a lot of time for guitar lessons, so I need to have materials handy for when I have time to learn. David Hamburger is a great acoustic guitar instructor. The DVD starts from the beginning learning basic open chords, which was a bit too basic for me, but each lesson intoduces a different strumming pattern and folk song to play using the newly learned chords and strumming pattern. Petty soon, you know all of these cool acoustic folk songs. I'm only half way through the 2 DVD set and my acoustic palying has become more fun to play and interesting to listen to. I recommend this DVD set to anyone who is interested in getting better at the acoustic guitar."
2,"Blah, I've read it all before..","There was absolutely nothing new to this book. I mean it just felt like everything was taken from other romance novels out there. I admit, there were some interesting points, but it really just didn't do anything for me. The whole deception in this book is how Alexandra didn't tell Philip she was a Connelly! But on about page 30, he asks if she is, and she says yes! Second worst book in the series! Avoid if possible!"
2,Skip Act One,"Gary Lakes is about as interesting as a half-eaten bowl of soggy cornflakes. Jessye Norman does not function as a ""rescue-me"" soprano. Kurt Moll is totally unable to play stupid characters. He always sounds like what he is--a natural musical genius. This is also a problem when he sings Osmin and Baron Ochs."
2,legion of boom is a bummer !!!!!!!!!!!!,"This 3rd complete CD by TCM compared to first two is average to below average. Too much CRAP SINGING. Rhythm beats somewhat weak and again too much vocals. Most electro fans HATE SINGING ; ""Born too slow"" REALLY SUCKS !!! SINGERS( ie Rahzel, John Garcia) NEED TO SHUT THEIR FACES AND LET THE SOUNDS ROLE. Anyway, guitar riffs for ""born too slow"" is CRAP, the piece must have been a favor for Wes Borland ""yeah sure maybe I can use this guitar piece in this song"" PLEASE, NO MORE CHICKS AND DUM GUYS SINGING ON TCM CD'S. !!!!"
2,Wow- this is sad,"This album really isn't any good. the tracks aren't as polish the sound un-original and down right boring.I got this album based on name alone since Vegas, and to a minor extent tweekend are decent albums that I enjoyd on occasion back in the days. I always had gripes with the unfinished/unoriginal song structures method uses, usually just looping a song at the end to death of fading, tweekend fixed that to some extent and the seemed like they where on the verge of really hitting a high mark. But this is horrible. they lost all the energy they had been costing on. and still don't seem to know how to write really great music. My stock in crystal method plumeted to an all time low. After fighting (not finding) its way into my heart with some of the catchiest BIG beats back in the day .. So bad it makes tweekend and vegas sound ""better"""
4,Better than Tweekend,"I like this one better than Tweekend. They branch out a bit with a rockin' ""Born Too Slow,"" along with more familiar sounding tracks. Overall, I like the album, but I wonder how much longer I'll be listening to The Crystal Method, The Chemical Brothers, et al. It sounds like the genre's pretty well played out."
2,Legion of yawns.,"This CD is definitely TCM's most uninspired work. There isn't too much by way of originality in the songs, too many tunes with vocal accompaniment, and all together kind of boring. Guest guitarist WES BORLAND (formerly of LIMP BISCUIT) is way underused, especially on the second to best track: WEAPONS OF MASS DISTORTION. Halfway into the tune you think it's going to kick into something full blown cool and never does. The highlight track is ACETONE, and is a reminder that CRYSTAL METHOD still has chops. However that certainly is not appearant on the rest of this album. Weak entry, especially after the inventive COMMUNITY SERVICE, and the do-all/say-all of techno recordings-VEGAS."
3,Inspiration is Key...,"I often read reviews on Amazon and doubt a lot of the negative comments. But a lot of the negative comments for Legion of Boom are correct. This CD just feels like it was a last minute project. The talent is obviously there, it just feels like not enough time or thought was put into the entire album. It's still a good album in it's own way, but like other reviews say, not all that inspired and in no way ground-breaking. It sounds like a lot of other music. The beats don't really have a climax point, it's just beats on top of beats that don't really change. This CD is worth a listen, to make your own choice. Stand out tracks are: 1. Starting Over, 5. I Know it's You, and 7. Broken Glass. Overall, I wouldn't call this a bad album, just mediocre. I did expect more."
2,Legion of Boom,"would you rather go to Vegas or the Golden Acorn Indian Gaming Casino?Sure the Golden Acorn is fun, has a nice buffet and feels a bit like Vegas. It still lacks the dirty corrupt sinful call girl strippers and Elvis.."
1,Boring,"I was hooked the first time I heard their first LP, Vegas, about 5 years ago or so. When Tweakend came out, I thought, decent album, but doesn't touch Vegas.Legion of Boom is a very boring album. Everytime I try to put it in I give it the benefit of a doubt. I figure maybe the last time I listened to it I was just tired, or I wasn't open to a new sound.Wrong.This album is just boring as hell. There is nothing in this album that keeps my attention. For anyone who thinks they are just growing musically, well, just keep thinking that I guess. They sound bored. Maybe they've made too much money with their songs appearing in commercials and movies, and they have just gotten lazy.Come on guys, light a fire under you so we can be wowed again."
3,Cute looking toy,"It looks really cute. even though my 9 mo old daughter doesn't understand it, but she likes it and gets really excited to play with it. I'd assume it would be suitable for role-playing for 2-3 year olds. Not bad any ways"
4,Just missing one thing,"My mother purchased this camera for both of us to use because the other camera that we have is too heavy to carry around. The camera is good, but we were surprised that it didn't come with a battery charger. All the rest is fine, and I think it takes good pictures. You can take pretty long videos with it, and it's pretty light too."
4,It's half the size of the one that rolled off my trunk lid,"This camera has a lot of great bells and whistles, even live video cam. It is simple to use, I started snapping right away without even opening the huge manual. It has few complications, great sound effects, cool automatic zoom lens that pops out when camera is turned on. It's lightweight (when compared to the 2000 model that I recently ran over with my car, just in case the fall off the trunk lid didn't entirely smash it.) I suggest the light-weight (yet thick) fabric case for good handling protection when not being used. This camera is a keeper - until I manage to destroy it - somehow. The cost makes the loss less painful while I get outstanding digital photos in the meantime. What's not to like?!"
4,Nice camera,"I gave this camera as a gift to my mother for her 60th birthday, and she loves it. Very simple to use, takes great pictures, and runs on AA batteries. The only drawback I have seen is the lag time from the time you press the button to take the picture to the time the camera is ready to take another picture (only a couple seconds, though). This camera made a great gift!"
2,Great value when working,I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera.After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate.I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers.
4,Manual,"Camera is light,small, and takes very good pictures.However,the manual is difficult to follow. I know I could do it much better."
2,I like the Canon ELPH models better,"I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it. For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot. It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings. While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects). I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it. I never had these problems with my ELPH s200. This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again."
2,not again,"Well, we are on our third Powershot of the same model. The first one was stolen and the next two broke within 2 weeks of having them. First it started by not turning on, then we would change the batteries and it would work for a few pictures, then the lens wouldn't open all the way! What a pain! I'm glad to see so many others are happy and not having this problem, but I think its time for me to try a different camera."
3,"Great pictures, sucks batteries like crazy","We have two Canon Powershot cameras and they take great pictures, are simple to use and are nice and small. Do yourself a favor and buy a model with a rechargable lithium battery. It will pay for the difference quickly. Digital cameras including the A510 drain batteries incredibly quickly."
4,Great Camera,"Overall this is a great camera. It has all the settings of a regular 35mm camera, so your picture-taking can get pretty advanced; and it's great just pointing and shooting as well. This is my first digi cam and I'm very pleased with it; however, I was surprised at how quickly it sucked up the batteries if it was on for a long period."
3,It's okay,"I don't really have much to compare this to, but I like it well enough. It confuses me at times, but we mostly get along.My main complaint is that the delay (or whatever you call how long it takes between clicking the button and actually taking the picture) is REALLY long, particularly right after you turn it on.Maybe I'm impatient, but I have thought that the camera isn't working a couple times because it took so long to take the picture."
5,Great Price & Value,I purchased this as a gift for my mother-in-law because her original bissell broke after many years of use.She was very thrilled and said it works great. They are very hard to find where I live and Amazon had thebest price.
4,Great for cleaning up in between vacuumings,"I bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet, which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz. It does a reasonable job cleaning, transforming my carpet from ""Does she ever vacuum?"" to ""Oh, she must have vacuumed yesterday"". It doesn't get all the fuzz and crumbs, but it does what I'd expect from a sweeper. It is also much lighter than my vacuum, so I'm much more likely to use it.My three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too. She insists on sweeping her own room (I won't complain).The main thing I've learned is that, because the handle slides together, it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head. This means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle, the sweeper will probably fall off, so pick it up near the sweeper. (It stays together fine when actually sweeping.)"
3,bissell sweeper,"It is small, but thats my fault for not looking at the size dimentions.... for what I needed for it does the job"
1,BISSELL Sturdy Sweep Sweeper,"I bought this sweeper in the hopes that it would do a decent job of picking up the cat hair in my kitchen, but it hardly picked up anything. Very dissappointing."
4,Plays well with FLOR carpet tiles,"I put in Flor carpet tiles and they appear to be just the right pile for this carpet sweeper to work well on. Like others have mentioned, it does not work well on hard floors, and does not work much at all in corners or edges, so I will still have to vacuum those spots. Works wonderfully on very tight short pile. I dump out a fair amount of ""floof"" so it does pick up a lot of stuff. You do have to figure out how to empty both chambers so that you don't miss the garbage. Contrary to earlier reviews, I find that the handle is strong and holding up well. Best $27 I've spent."
4,One irritating problem,"This is a handy little sweeper, light weight, narrow enough to fit between the legs of dining room chairs, etc. It does a great job of picking up pet hair and the type of gritty dirt we get in our area. It's one problem? The handle fits to the base by pushing on rather than screwing. No matter how hard I try, even bopping it with a hammer, it still pulls off. I may resort to gluing that just for the irritation factor, but the sweeper itself works great. No cord. No batteries to charge. Just an old fashioned sweeper like mom had."
1,bad purchase,"I bought that sweeper a month ago, and I can say that it was a very bad purchase. I have a wood floor and the sweeper makes a lot of noise, it is impossible to clean in the edges or corners and its head doesn't turn. I do not recomend ti buy this product, in addition the stick has three parts which separate constantly"
5,The Saddest Story Ever Told,"Nancy Springer creates the most sympathetic ""bad seed"" character in Mordred. His tale of trying to fight his fate is intriguingly horrible and sad. Mordred finds love--in Nyneve as a mentor, in Gull as a companion, in Lynette as a possible love. And all of it is lost because of his curse.When Mordred and Arthur discuss their entwined fates and Mordred says, ""What have I done?"" the result is heart wrenching. By this point in the novel (Part Four) it has become abundantly clear that Mordred is a good soul, a fighter, someone to connect with and care about. And yet, he has no control over how his life will turn out.The death of Gull is one of the most upsetting deaths in all of literature. Mordred's one true companion, Mordred's only friend. When he buries her beautiful whiteness under the dirt, the starkness of the white/black contrast is fantastic.Cheers to Nancy Springer for such a powerful tale that always leaves me emotionally changed after reading."
3,Works best where radio stations are scarce,"The transmitter needs to use a frequency that does not have a radio station already assigned to it. In a city like Los Angeles (where I live), there aren't any available frequencies. On road trips, we get some use out of it. The farther away we get from L.A., the more frequencies we can find to use ... then we get pretty decent sound through the car speakers. Unfortunately, as we keep driving, we'll eventually bump into other radio station using our selected setting and have to search once more for another open frequency."
5,Season 3,I saw code lyoko on tv but never saw the ending so i decided to buy the whole series this is season 3
3,"Broken parts, Works great now","[First Impression]i never really had an idea of how big this tank was from the reviews until i finally recieved mine, its not heavy, just a little bulky, not a big deal because i have a remote hose.[On the field] its a shame, i paid [...]$ for this tank and the first time i fill it up at the pro shop, the 1800 lbs disc breaks. Not a big problem, but still thats another [...] bucks to fix. other than that, i get about 700-1000 shots of nitro depending on the gun i use at the moment. this tank is great though. If u arent using a remote hose, i recommend getting a cover for it because its gonna slide if u put it on your shoulder"
3,mutter,2 dvd set was nice but didnt keep it in collection. Somewhat boring and hard to stay awake through it even at 7:00 pm. but it was nice-ish not worth more than 10.00 or get it on ebay
5,A must read.,I like the way Norman McLean handles the relationship with his brother. It is so vivid and genuine that I can almost see how things happen in front of my own eyes.
5,Flawless American Literature,"Norman's stories are undoubtedly the finest collection of American literature I've ever read. I can not read the final paragraph of the title story without crying. . . I've read it dozens of times now. Truly ""haunting."""
1,Very Annoying,"This CD contains some of the most annoying muzac I have ever heard. All the songs sound pretty much the same... none without that put-me-right-to-sleep synthetic keyboard stuff. I was disappointed, I really was expecting to get alot of Brazilian flavor from this CD, it just didn't deliver for me."
5,Eternal,"Eternal in beauty, in refined arrangements, in smoothness, perfect for a erotico- romantic night."
3,Good quality but didn't fit well,"It fit well in the passenger side of my BMW but 1/2 inch short for the driver side (22"")."
4,Very good product I,"This product is equal to the original.Very good product, I recommend buying another and, if necessary.OuvirLer foneticamenteDicionário - Ver dicionário detalhado"
2,Not for me,"would not recommend this book. I found it difficult to get into the story line,kept trying , thought it may get better as it went along. Gave up in the end."
3,Not what I expected/wanted...,"I had been looking for a set that my daughter and her friends could safely use with real food & liquids. After researching and reading all of the reviews on this product and seeing the actual box cover on another site (there is milk in one of the cups), I thought this was exactly what I wanted. However, when I opened it, I noticed immediately that the cups and bowls have holes at the bottom!Suffice it to say, I plan to buy another set now and will let her play with this one until the other one arrives (it's not worth the shipping to return it). Since no reviewer has mentioned the holes before, I thought I should give a warning to other parents who are looking for a more realistic set for their children."
1,Total disappointment,"This book contains only a small part of the poem. What a disappointment (and a misrepresentation, too.) While the price is inexpensive, it's not really worth much of anything. Better to spend a few dollars more on an edition that contains the complete classic masterpiece."
1,FALSE TEACHER!,"After going through this book I was amazed at how deceptive the author cleverly and cunningly distorts scripture as a basis of robbing God. Of course this book will have a wide appeal to many in the church who are dull of hearing, lukewarm in heart and looking for loop holes NOT to tithe. This book is clearly anti-God's Word and therefore anti-God. The abundance of Scripture, both Old & New Testaments are very plain - God expects every TRUE Believer to honor and obey Him with the tithe and promises great blessing for the tither.Don't waste your money on this un-Scriptural book. Any thinking person reading this poorly written book can easily see the gaping holes in the author's twisted theology! My advice to you is that you pay no attention to the author's WILD CLAIMS as he simply has no Biblical basis for his teachings. Jesus warned us about FALSE teachers and FALSE prophets in the last days - so be warned!"
2,Not able to get working,"So far, I haven't been able to get this thing to work. Pelouze says I was sold a discontinued model and my computer neither has nor uses a serial port. So, my next step is to purchase an adapter from serial to USB. Then we shall see.So Far, I am not impressed."
1,Don't do it.,"This is independent, true. But it is CHEAP, like homemade, no budget type of film. It can be bought with a 50 pack of movies for 16.00 TOTAL. So why in the hell would someone buy it for 13.00 single? It ws a really dark movie (as in bad lighting), also bad acting, bad camera work, bad script, poor noise level and NOTHING made sense. I HATED it. I wish there was a ZERO. The only thing good was the cover art."
3,Not very pertaining to post grad life,"It seems that focuses a lot on those who are on the verge of graduation or even high schoolers . For this, the title is misleading. The material seems more directed towards those will have to make some very daunting choices about choosing careers or colleges and in that sense it is great and I would definitely recommend . Not a very hard or challenging read and is filled with real life scenarios to explain some of the topics."
2,so predictable,"I thought this would be more of a mystery. But no, it was a cheesy romance novel. It was also very unevenly written: sometimes she just switched to differernt characters with no transition at all. Initially I thought that two different books had been accidently cobbled together."
3,Light read,It was a cute dog story with a little bit of mystery involving love and romance. I recommend it for quick read.
4,What a sweet story!,"This book really surprised me. I'd put off reading it for some time because I thought it was going to be ""flaky."" (A dog psychologist??) I'm happy to say it was anything but. If you're looking for an easy weekend read, this is it. I really enjoyed reading it."
2,Beware: Boring,"I just can't seem to finish this book. The characters aren't really people I want to get to know, I fear even Muffin is a dog I would pass in the street and not try to pet and I love dogs. As I write this review I suddenly have realized that there is no reason to let this story continue to take up space in my Kindle."
3,not awesome,"The book was ok and I did finish reading but was a little too predictable and not always believeable. I read to be entertained so, for the price, it did the job. Not something I would read again."
3,not what I expected,It is more of a romance of sorts than a mystery...I thought it was a different type of story...cute if you are an animal lover
2,"too much 'teenage age"" type romance","The premise for the story was intriguing, but the story was overwhelmed by 'teenage-type"" romance that takes up way too much book space. I wouldn't even recommend it as a ""light"" read."
3,an OK read,"I found this book to be just a little too predictable. It was a cute story of ""set up"" love."
2,meh,"trite, conflicted, unconvincing. don't bother with it. if you want formula romance, there are books that actually make sense. sadly, Trish Jensen actually writes fairly well, but nothing can help a story in which you know whodunnit waaaaaayyy before the author does the reveal."
1,Oh no .. Please don't. I want 80 minutes of my life back.,"All I can say is don't rent it, don't buy it and if you're unlucky enough to be somewhere when it is being played (Train, Plane, Ship etc..) just gouge your eyes out and stick pencils in your ears.I've been trying to think of words that describe this rubbish, please feel free to pick from any of the following !!terrible , inexcusable, dire, tiresome, atrocious, unpardonable, awful, mind-numbing, intolerable, excruciating, unbearable, agonizing, painful, indefensible, lackluster, boring, appalling, dismal, grim, calamitous, catastrophic, disastrous, dreary, tediousIf I've missed something please feel free to drop in some other words that describe this rubbish, but shame on you if you actually sat through the film after reading this !Really, all joking aside, don't waste your time. Ulli Lommel should not be allowed to make movies, he should not be allowed anywhere near a camera, motion or otherwise.Heed my warning !!! You have been told !!"
1,It never stops!,"This is the worst movie i've seen in a long time. It's a cool idea, but everything about the finshed product just.....well, it sucks. Hard. :sigh: when will Ulli Lommel stop?"
5,El Problema,"Yo vi a Ricardo Arjona en el Premio a lo Nuestro y quede cautivada con su musica, su estilo y su belleza. La orquesta y la mujer que le acompañaba en el coro estuvieron estupendas. Trabajo en un ambiente muy americano, pero cuando escucharon esta cancion lo primero que les encanto fue la musica y cuando les dije lo que traducen las liricas les encanto todavia mas. Quiero felicitar al señor Arjona y decirle que el me hace sentir muy orgullosa de ser hispana, le deseo muchos mas exitos y ojala pronto se lance al mundo Northeamericano. Estoy segura que la gente Norteamericana lo apreciara aun mas. FELICIDADES!!!!"
3,A Note on Cybermancy,"This book condolidates the information in Shadowtech and Cybertechnology as well as adding some new stuff. However, I feel the section on cybermancy needs some discussion. When I first read about cybermancy in the Cybertechnology sourcebook I felt that the book did an excellent job of making cybermancy sound creepy, dark, and dangerous. Which it should because a cybermantically treated character will have to do lot of role playing to do their character credit. While Man and Machine has all the game rules necessary to use cybermancy I reccomend you take a look back at Cybertechnolgy to get a ""feel"" for the practice if you intend to use it in your games."
5,Too cute!,We got this for our son's first birthday. He's over 2 now and still LOVES it! The dino is really colorful and cute. It's also very durable and easy to spot clean.
5,ALWAYS PLEASED!!!,"ZANE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!! THIS BOOK WAS OFF THE HOOK, THE GIRL HAS MAD TALENTS, TRY THIS BOOK AND GET CAUGHT INTO HER WEB AGAIN! THE GIRL GIVES SINGLE BLACK WOMEN A VOICE. IF YOU'RE HOOKED ON ZANE THIS WILL LEAVE YOU WANTING MORE."
3,not all it's worked up to be,this book was decent but not zane's best. the plot was kind of weak but an unexpected death made it interesting. other than that I believe a little bit more could be added to make a more enticing story. Great concept though....
4,Love is not Lost,"Zane not only gives us erotic definition but she also has us think. Why? Why when two people are happy something negative always happens.Yardley - a handsome chiropractor who specializes in ""cracking backs""Rayne - an independant woman with a child to raise (her mother)These two people meet by ""Chance"" (Rayne's nosy best friend)and develop a beautiful and intimate relationship. Both are scared to love but are willing to see where it brings them. This book is filled with love, laughter, happiness and sadness. Zane once again lets us know it is okay to be a woman and a freak at the same time but when you find that ""special"" person make sure you hold on tight because you will never know if that will be your last time."
4,"I loved it, But Im frowning @ Zane","I loved the book, loved it, till the end, so unexpected turn of events, and it wasnt welcome.. YOU HEAR me? Not welcomed. And so soon in the book for him to find a new love after the death of his true love. I liked rayne wayyyyyy better than yardley, and I cant believe Zane outed her in a single paragraph. Im more than pissed. And even though supposedly 2 years passed between her death and yardley meeting that new woman (whatever her name was) It was actually only a few pages. DIdnt give the readers any time at all to adjust. Im a stubborn type person, so I will not be reading part 2. Loved it up until the end."
4,Real Female Football Fan,I loved the book. Well documented journey of two people trying to find love and the time we waste playing games. But I did have one problem a real football fan knows that the Cowboys and Redskins could not have played each other in the Super Bowl because they are in the same division and conference. I know that it is a minor point but as a real female football fan that stood out to me.
3,"Good, but I expected more","This book was good and definetly had a message about living life to the fullest. However, I don't think that this story was a good example of the message that she wanted to project. I think Zane spent too much time setting the scene in the beginning. This book doesn't really get good until half way through it. The middle is spicy, but the end is over in less than 2 chapters, so it's basically like...slow, good, is that it? The book was pretty predictable except for the last 2 chapters. Yardley's close freind Felix got away with a little too much, and although I think that she wanted Yardely to have a forgiving spirit, I think she created his character a little too passive when it came to Felix.Not all bad...I loved Rayne & Yardley's character and could relate to Rayne's life in this book."
3,James Last - Meine Schonsten Erfolge - 20-02-95 Spectrum-Polygram 5528412,"James Last - Meine Schonsten Erfolge - 20-02-95 Spectrum-Polygram 5528412It's always a pleasure to listen to music performed by James Last & His Orchestra.My favourite tracks from this CD: 4,12,13Duration: 54:181 Don't Cry For Me Argentina Rice, Webber 6:422 Endless Journey Last, Traditional 3:433 Evie Webb 3:524 Luciana Santo, Tapajos 4:155 Tango Regina Last 4:046 Jean McKuen 4:227 The House Of The Rising Sun Last, Traditional 4:238 El Condor Pasa Last, Traditional 3:039 Rainy, Rainy Last 4:5810 Andanca Caymmi, Sonto, Tapajos 3:5011 Ballad Of The Easy Rider McGuinn 3:0012 The Pearl Fishers Bizet 3:5513 The Last Guest Is Gone Last 3:48"
1,pass this one by...,"I read alot of romances.. and at 5.99 and up.. Im starting to have to get more picky.. I had put Karyn Monk on my list of authors to follow.. but like the previous reviewers found this book to be very disappointing. In fact, not worth the money. The heroine has very little to recommend her, the plot just plain boring..and you do question why the hero is interested! Lets hope this work was just the result of a couple of bad months, and her other works are more typical.."
4,Gotta Have This!,"This is like the best of Esquivel, or Walter Wanderly. Is it campy? Absolutely, and who's sorry? Jobim and company were exporting a smooth sound that was jazz and a beat packaged for the Brubeck lovers. Like Jobim's early Verve releases it's pure melodic Bossa Nova and you'll love it."
2,"message and idea are good, price high for what you get","The idea of the book is good, if you don't take care of the little things when they first appear, they end up snowballing and becoming big things. However, I thought the book would include more to read and digest rather than just drawings of paperclips. OK I get the message now offer some insight on motivation. The message didn't need 109 pages of paperclips to get the message across. One cartoon would have done. It took me all of 5 minutes to ""read"". Sorry, wanted more for the money."
3,"Soft Paws, not so great","I think the idea of the soft paws is great, as I really don't want to declaw my kitten. However, Soft paws seemed to be more trouble than they were worth. My kitten kept getting things stuck between his claw and the soft paw, including my wife's hair. I gave it three stars, because it does work, it really helps stop the scratching, but I don't think it is worth the trouble. It did look really cute on my kitten though. Also, the seller, KoolKats, was great and the package arrived in no time! They also threw in a toy mouse for my kitten! I would definitely buy from them again, just not this product"
2,Don't do it!,I read through this book once and actually threw it out. A Martha Stewart fan I was disappointed in this one. The ideas are a little too basic - I would recommend something a little more fun.
5,Season Duck dynasty,Fast delivery...Great Thanks Husband Loves this show bought it for him for when he does truck driving in the states overnight trips
3,DVD-R AND VHS QUALITY,"THE SHOW - 5 STARSTHE CAST - 10 STARSDVD QUALITY - 3 STARSLove the show and the guys and girls of Duck Commander. But the DVD is a let down. I knew before pre-placing that it was going to just be a DVD-R from Amazon based on small print I read, but I can make better quality recordings than this with my Pioneer DVD recorder and computer software. I've got all 15 episodes on the DVR and wanted this for travel humor for lake trips and hunting trips. Maybe the guys at DC and/or A&E; will catch wind of this and put a REAL version out done professionally in the future. In today's HD world, VHS quality just isn't going to cut it.....And what happened to the ZZ Top theme song we all love so much? It's been replaced on these discs.Hate I paid $15 for it but if I didn't have them on the DVR, they'd do."
3,spring booster,"got this for a weak rear spring on my honda, it held up well. under heavy use, would recommend this product."
1,Edit the Kindle Version!,"Having read the reviews of the errors and misspellings in the Kindle version, I have decided not to purchase it. It seems incumbent upon the publisher to re-edit the Kindle version and notify potential buyers the errors have been corrected. Why is this not being done? Herman Wouk is one of my favorite authors and I'd love to download his novels to my Kindle."
4,Gripping historical fiction,"I agree with the reviewer who claims that some of the situations in which the main character, Victor Henry, finds himself are ridiculously fortuitous. Had any American seen so much and influenced as many people as Henry did, he would have been recorded in the annals of United States history. The fact remains, however, that this is fiction, not history, and these episodes contribute to the overall effect of this work as a sweeping historical drama.I love _War and Remembrance_, and its companion piece, _The Winds of War_. The books contain complementary human dramas: the struggle of a family to survive and the defining conflict of the twentieth century. Herman Wouk certainly succeeded in his aim to use fiction to demonstrate the horrific effects of global conflict. I have read these books several times throughout the years, and feel confident that I will continue my enjoyment indefinitely"
3,Decent little record,"I am a big Wilco fan so was quite interested to hear this recording. The strongest tracks are Hey Chicken and The Ruling Class. The remainder of the album is mixed, quite a bit of filler, largely missable."
5,Review Schopenhauer?,This is a book you just read and try to understand. Yes it is dated now but it's also the building block for many of the ideas that follow and are taken for granted today. The Kindle copy is clean and easy to read which is not always the case.
3,Overall a very good and highly recommended book.,"Though the book is lacking REALLY good quotes in some areas, it does provide a wide array of topics. It's alphabetical listing is very convenient. If you don't find what you're looking for under one topic, it lists other areas in which you might find something similar. If you can't find an appropriate quote in this book, one does not exist. There are quotes for ANY situation!! It also gives a brief description of each of the authors which is highly convenient if you'd like to find more books or qoutes by that author. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a great source of familiar and highly amusing quotations."
4,"""Ray Foxx"" or ""Jamie Charles""?","Talent and determination will out is the theme of this fun biopic. Jamie Foxx has the look and the moves down as blues/country/soul and you-name-it music legend Ray Charles. Early in life, overcoming the physical odds of his blindness and later the blindness of the music industry (along with his own substance-related demons), Ray never sold himself short--a good lesson for all of us."
1,Ray,"We received this DVD as a gift. We were very excited to watch it at home (we missed it in the theaters). Based on the 30 minutes or so we were able to watch, it looks like it's a really good movie. Unhappily for us, the DVD is defective. It won't play past chapter 8 without crashing (on two different DVD players). Universal really should do a little quality control. We certainly will avoid buying any of their titles in the future."
5,Scandal Is Nothing New,"I was born in 1981, so I missed every event featured in this movie. Ray was always that smiling, blind piano guy to me. I had no idea he was involved in such shameful scandal. But what's even more interesting is that at least one of his scandals was based on a noble cause instead of a shameful one.Ray is a perfect picture of humanity. Struggling through through neverending internal and external obstacles, and always on the verge of total collapse no matter how high his talent and hard work had taken him. In fact, the higher he went, the closer to collapse he seemed to get. Why is it that so often no blessing or curse deters us from loving the very things that kill us?I'll never look at Ray's music the same way again. This was a wonderful film."
3,Are you kidding?,"I had rated this once before - Are you kidding? - because you had sent it to me and asked me to review it before I had even received it. Well, I'm still calling it - Are you kidding? - because it really was a crappy movie. I really like Ray Charles and I love his music. I can't pinpoint exactly what is wrong with this movie, but it certainly was not what I had expected. Maybe it was just the way it was put together."
5,Ray (Widescreen Edition),Excelent movie. Very suprised by the content being a big Ray Charles Fan. There was alot to his life that I didn't know. This movie is a must for your collection.
3,"it skip a lot of time but the content was good, very eye opening to the original one.","The movie its great and so many way, specialy how the story is portray and how it develops.. this edicion was very eye openin. hence provided a great understanding on the original story tha came out on big screen the movie was skiping a lot and the format of some of the scenes were different from each other!"
3,Could not view in my player,So I have an HD Bluray player and this CD would not play on it so I was very disappointed. Therefore I can not give it the rating it deserves.
3,Jamie Foxx is amazing....,"Jamie Foxx is amazing in this music filled but somewhat two dimensional view of the life of Ray Charles. The film opens wonderfully but starts to drag a bit in the second half. Drugs....Woman...Drugs....Woman....Drugs....I think 30 minutes could be cut from the film without loss. The cuts to Rays past often worked well, but on occasion reminded me more of a music video than inner torment."
5,Meet Ray Charles,"Our culture is different and better because of Ray Charles. And our knowledge of him as a man and as a creative genius is complete with this movie.Sort of like with ""Fog of War,"" it's amazing that Ray Charles approved the script and, derivately, the way it all ends up on screen. Some screen biographies are fawning and obviously false; this one is unsparing. A womanizer and drug addict; a man who could use people ruthlessly and place himself at the center of his own universe.All for the music. Like his screen wife says, that's all that mattered to him, it seems. But he expresses for all of us joy, love, sex, misery, longing, lonliness and just plain fun.It was so sad when he died. But with this DVD, ""Hey, everybody, Ray Charles is in town,"" so let the good times roll.PS - for that tune, buy the CD called ""Q's Jook Joint."" Ray does it up with a big band and sounds like a young man..."
2,Ray Charles...in slow motion,"The acting was great in this movie, however it drug on and on. By the time time it got to be 1965, I was wondering how many more scenes I could watch of the same type of thing. They should have edited the film better and also shown more of Ray Charles life after drug abuse. While the beginning of the movie was excellent, I felt that the end was slow and less exciting than it could have been."
2,5 stars for the movie and 1 star for this edition...,"While Ray is one of the best movies I have ever seen, this 2 disc ""limited edition"" is a complete and utter rip-off. The extras in both packaging and video are cheesy at best. The regular version of RAY has everything a fan of the movie would need. Don't waste your money on this over-blown presentation. Luckily, I was able to return this version and get the lesser priced, but just as thorough, version."
3,Just Not a Holmes Brothers Fan,"This is the 2nd Holmes Brothers cd I bought based on the effusive reviews and brief excerpts on Amazon. I have been disappointed twice. My complaint is with the material, it just didn't move me. My recommendation is that you find someplace to listen to this CD in detail before purchasing. You may love it, I didn't."
3,It's good but .....,The examples do not work exactly as shown. Good for a programmer from another language to get a overview but it is frustrating to type in 100 line example of code to not have it work. (I own Visual Basic .net & I think they use visual basic studio which seems to have expanded visual basic capabilites?)
2,Charred Souls,"I think that people are giving high reviews based only on the story. I can't see how this can be given five stars based on the writing style, the amount of grammar errors, and the amount of repetition."
4,Painful yet compelling,"The author shows a lot of anger in her writing of this book and upon reading it you will discover why. The cruelties inflicted upon these children put the child welfare system, the school system, law enforcement and the town they grew up in to shame! This was a painful book to read, I felt helpless for these children and disgust for the adults in their life who did nothing to help them.I believe the author has a long road ahead of her before healing herself, if she ever can. Powerful reading."
3,"Well, it's alright. But pt. 2 is better.","After a 3 year wait Elements pt.1 is a bit of a disappointment. It's not that this album is bad, it's just that I expected better, particularly after Infinite, Destiny, and Visions. Jens Johansens' keyboards are probably the strongest part of this album, they never fail to impress me. The same could be said of Jorg Michael's drums. However, Tolkki and Kotipelto didn't seem to have their heart in these songs. Honestly, if you have to choose between this album and Pt.2, buy Pt. 2."
4,"A Story of love, family and lots of Hard work","I really enjoyed reading this book. It has so many life lessons for children from the love of a family, how to come together in a crisis, or even just how to support each other in a family. I love how the family in the story all save up any coins they have or can find and put them into a big jar just to save up for a great chair. This book shows the importance of saving your money for something you really want. Since the family lost everything in a fire they had to start over and that shows children not to give up when things get rough. I think children of all ages could really enjoy reading this book or just having it read to them."
4,Very touching,"This is a classic story by now. I tear up every time I read it when we get to the part about the whole neighborhood helping them move into their new house after the old one burns down. It's a wonderful example of community, and very realistic.I will note that this book is a bit wordy, and may not hold the attention of children under the age of 5 or so. If your kiddo has a short attention span, wait a year before reading this one."
5,Nice hot sauce,"This sauce is unusual in that it does not have vinegar in it. It's a nice, spicy sauce with a good flavor and is inexpensive. It's quite good on tacos. To save on shipping charges I ordered 3 at a time which reduced my cost per bottle by quite a bit."
5,goood purchase,I was pleased with the Actron Digital Multimeter. It was a good price and the multimeter was user friendly.
5,Post Its Ahoy,"It hold Post It notes well. They pop up out of the holder on demand, and the desk caddy stays where you put it. What more could one ask?"
4,Excellent Introduction to Electrical Machines,"As an undergraduate, I used Fitzgerald/Kingsley as my machines text. This text is vastly superior to that book and Chapman's Electric Machinery book. The book covers many topics both from the internal operation of the machine and when the machine is connected to external equipment.The book is clearly written for the undergraduate engineer and he places plenty of examples in the text.I believe the practicing engineer will also find this book useful as well as there are many practice problems that relate to re-world situations."
5,Helping sagging suspension,"I got these spacers for my 1996 and 1997 van. Even after replacing the shocks, the suspensions seemed too soft and had lost that firm ""new"" feeling. I cannot afford new coil springs with the installation costs, so this solved the ""problem"" in less than an hour and I did the work myself in my driveway. Now the vans have a firmer ride (that I like), handles better, and carries loads without 'wallowing', and the headlights going skyward. I put these spacers on all four coil springs on the my '97 van, and on just the rear of the '96 model since that is the one that my wife usually drives. She likes the softer feel."
4,clothes for I-Dog,It's an okay toy if your child wants to dress up their I-Dogs. It's not meant to be educational. There are plenty of other toys out there that children can learn with. This is just a cute novelty item.
2,"Most of this box set is crap, - for very old fans only.","You would have to be an very ardent JP fan to like this box-set. The music covers literally their whole career. But, most of the tracks from the 70's and 80's are crap to listen to now. The live concert is okay at the most. Priest are doing something similar to VH and re-releasing their old records in different compilations. JP used to be a good metal band, but their music is tiresome now. R.I.P. Judas Priest."
5,knee support,"i have been playing racquetball for 35 years. the knee suports allow me full movement, with the support i need. great product!"
2,Spring steel??? Where is it???,This is a low duty brace. The brace I was sent didn't have any spring steel stays in it. It didn't feel like it offered much more support than a neoprene only brace would offer.
4,Good for skiing!,"I got this for my husband but I thought it would be a little more stiff. It works good and he wears it skiing. So, I guess we didn't need it stiffer. We didn't want one that was too stiff one and we already had one that was just fabric so, this worked out perfect! Great quality!"
4,Nice family or friends game,"You have to read the rules carefully, maybe more than once; but it's fun for a family evening or with friends."
5,one of our favorite authors,Have read his short stories about real life people and experiences for many years. Always delightful.
4,It's so cute!,"I bought this for my daughter's i-Dog and she loves it. The only issue I had was the cost of shipping. It was almost half the cost of the actual outfit (...). I wouldn't recommend this product for children under 8, the little pieces can get lost easily."
2,strange music from a great artist,"Battiato has written a very strange album. When listening to battiato`s albums you will feel happy and sometimes depressed, because he writes very different music styles, but this is something I never heard. Old style new age music with a lot of analog syntersizers and no melody at all. When you want to buy battiato`s music then do not buy this one in the firts place, but start with Lòmbrello E La Machina Da Cusire."
3,My child loved it!,"This was a fun costume for Halloween. The main problem was my son wanted to wear it more than that. The fit and finish is pretty poor, but it is a inexpensive costume. The head fit poorly, falling into my sons eyes. I had to re-sew the hand peice, the shoulders and some other small area, after a day of use. The material is pretty thin.So if you are just looking for a cheap costume for a couple of hours of use, this could be your costume."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping to complete my Halloween purchases with an inexpensive costume for my 3.5 year old. It turned out that the material was very flimsy and the dino's tail doesn't actually stand out from the rest of the body (as in the picture). Believe me, that makes a lot of difference in the appearance. I ended up buying another dinosaur costume to appease my son."
2,Lame,I could not get them in..I tried soap and water but that makes them to slipery to push on. Only got then 1/4 way on and gave up. Will try again when I get the metal spacers that can be used to lower or rise the coils. I plan to use them for spacers just to get the rubber ones in place and then remove the metal one out of they way as needed to get the job done.2001 GMC Sonoma
4,Nice and easy,I bought this for my grandma to make it easier on her to clean up instead of lugging out the huge vacuum. I actually bought it to replace her old one. She likes it very much BUT it is not quite as good as her original. But she would tell me if it didn't work or she didn't like it so it MUST be good! :) I'm going to get one for myself eventually too.
5,Surprised at how well it works,"I really didn't expect this product to work as well as it does. It really does pick up all the little stuff, and is very easy to clean. Even the roller is easy to clean when stray hair is tangled around it. Yes, I also experienced the problem with the pole coming loose at the bottom - I just inserted some folded heavy paper into the hole along with the pole; tightened it up easily. At the price, for me, that's not even an issue to complain about. I really love this sweet lil sweeper"
2,not very good,"Sweeper was easy to put together, no problem with handle falling apart. Light weight easy to push. It only picks up about half the stuff from my carpets. Brush is not very stiff. Will not pick up cat hair. I bought it just for this purpose, for quick cleaning between using the heavy vacuum cleaner. Maybe a higher price one would be better. Will not buy another one unless I can feel the weight for the brushes."
3,Not precision engineering,"Before I bought this carpet sweeper, I carefully read all the Amazon reviews. So when my sweeper came, I carefully followed the directions enclosed and took to heart the advice posted by those who said they had no problems with the handle. Well I'm here to tell you -- I pounded that handle within an inch of its life -- but it still pulled apart. Nonetheless, it works well on carpets, bare floors and is spectacular on throw rugs and it looks quite sporty with the red electric tape holding the pieces of the handle together. My theory is that perhaps the quality control/inspection of handle pieces might not be all that it could be. And the price was certainly right."
1,BAD,"It didn't seem to be picking up anything on the tile floor, so I swept and then tried using it to pick up what I had swept - it took SEVERAL Minutes just to get most of what I had already swept to get picked up. Then I went to empty it, and the handle came off and most of what it had finally picked up got dumped back all over the floor, to be swept up again.It is worse on carpet; hard to get it to pick up anything at all."
3,kind of flimsy,"expecting a better made product, it's ok, does the job that i need it to do. i probably would not buy this product again."
4,Great for small jobs,This sweeper is great for small jobs when you're in a hurry. I try to use before I go to bed at night throung the traffic patterns so the house looks good the next morning. I does a pretty good job. I probably woud rate it higher if the handle was more stable
4,Works Just Fine,"This works just fine; no problems with it; can't beat it for the money and remember, it's not a vacuum cleaner."
5,Great!,"Good for the price! Sometimes you have to go over things twice, but it picks up my sons Cheerios!"
2,Good for carpets; useless for hardword floors,"The manufacturer's description is misleading. It sounds like it's an all-around basic sweeper, but it does not work on hard-wood floors. Sure, for carpets, it's quite helpful, but that's not why I bought it. We have the pricey vacuum for our one and only oriental carpet (I have allergies). I wanted something to pick up all the debris my kids bring in on our hardwood floors, which cover the remainder of our house. The sweeper picks up nothing. Literally, you can run it over the same spot 5 times, but you'll be very lucky if it picks up anything. It's really meant for carpets -- the rollers inside use the friction with the carpet fibers to pick up debris. Without that friction, nothing happens.Yes, the handle doesn't work on mine either, but that didn't concern me: a piece of packing tape easily solves that. My problem is that the product is not as versatile as the manufacturer leads you to believe."
2,Does not work on hard floors,"Works for quick jobs on carpet, but was disappointing to find out that it absolutely does not work on hard floors. On hard floors it simply pushes dirt / garbage around."
5,Really Good Between-Vacuuming Sweeper,"This is a good sweeper for everyday tidiness, like crumbs and dirt. I recommend it."
3,It is just ok,I have had one of these before but the two I purchased this time seem to be less sturdy and cheaply made. The rubber bumper keeps coming off and the handle had to be taped together to keep it from coming off. I did not find this with the first one I had.
3,A fine effort with an unsatisfying ending.,"Five very different characters who share one similarity, thrown together to solve a misterious ""virus"" affecting the Seattle Matrix RTG.The characters, with their divergant, frequently conflicting, personalities are interesting to follow. The story itself is intriguing. However, the ending (involving the Otaku & the mystery of the ""Deep Resonance,"" and the motivations/goals of the ""D.R."") was in my mind unsuccessful, though I can't say I blame the author for this because it was probably inspired by remarks on the subject in Virtual Realities 2.0 (p.148).However, I do think Stephen Kenson handled a similar theme much more successfully in Technobabel, so Psychotrope suffers by comparison."
2,"A bit dull, don't you think?","I was quite confused when I read somewhere how this was one of better Astrud's albums, and how her instrumental accompaniment/partnership on this outing practically equalls that of Getz, Jobim or Joao Gilberto...This sounds like pure easy listening music, as opposed to her more jazzy sides, but than again, maybe my tastes in music are just not broad enough to embrace this album... But listen to third song - isn't it the dullest possible recording imaginable (some songs are a bit better)."
4,Review by Walter Wandersucks,"Hi I'm Walter. You know how Stan Getz brought the saxaphone to bossa nova, well shucks, I brought my cheezy organ to this gig. Unfortunately Astrud did some songs with me that you may have never heard and will never hear again without my ""wonderful"" organ sound included next to Austrud's beautiful voice. See ya on the Lawrence Welk Show! (the 4 stars are for Astrud; of course!)-Walter Wandersucks"
4,Soap,"I purchased this soap some years ago SOMEWHERE where it came with a boar's hair shaving brush, nice shaving mug with ""Burt's face"" on it, bay rum soap, aftershave and this shaving soap. I loved the smell of this soap however it didn't lather very well. Whether it was the soap, brush or and my technique I can't know. The brush and soap are gone but I still have the mug for my shaving. The price here is rediculous as are the prices on Ebay. Does Burt's Bees manufacture this anymore?"
4,"Pele2178 is an unoriginal, insecure little child",How else do you explain someone who tries to pass off another's insightful and intelligent writing as their own? i also read that er...'review' on pitchfork a week ago. He must think amazon's customers are stupid. I can copy and paste too! The album is tremendous however...
5,Cultural Arts Center of Saint Louis recommends,"One in Seven Afghan women die in childbirth. An Afghan doctor struggles to make a difference.Dr. Mojadidi, a specialist in women's health, decides to return to his war-ravaged homeland to help rebuild and modernize the hospitals and clinics which serve the women of Afghanistan. Motherland Afghanistan is an inspiring portrait of dedication and fortitude in some of the most harsh and unforgiving physical, political and cultural terrains on Earth.CAC's Comments: In Afghanistan, if you wanted to have surgery you must pre-purchase your own suture material and gauze at a pharmacy before going to the hospital. Not much is provided for you and the same goes for medicines. After International donations and non-profit funding, certain Afghan hospitals have had the opportunity to modernize their standards and health codes."
1,Sick!,"This is NOT erotica, this book is for sick an demented psychos and not for a normal healthy sexual human being. I bought it out of curiosity, oh boy did I ever learn a lesson!"
2,70's Progressive Music for the 90's,"Picture Rick Emmet (Triumph) fronting a Genesis/Jethro-Tull cover band and you'll get a feel for the sound of this band. The musicians are ok, but somehow you can't help feeling you've heard it all before! Not very original music. Save your money and invest in Spock's Beard!"
3,"Righter:3stars,1/2,as an excessive ref. to Wind&Wuthering","Well the singer doesn't resemble the style of the vocalists from Genesis,instead the music structure is often in the vein of ""Wind & Wuthering"", expecially into the last suite ""An imps tale"". The other songs are very melodic, by means of 70's keyboards and some music passages reminding me of Kansas,but according to a diverse approach, very similar to that one of Spock's Beard! There's a certain passion in the execution, but the songs are not so amazing ... it depends on our tastes naturally, but of course I prefer for example Babylon as a derivative band ... well make your choice !!"
1,Green magic lipstick,"Well I was so happy when I receive my magic lipstick, but for no reason it broke and only was able to used with careful, because I did not wanted all over my fingers etc. :("
5,hell yeah finch!,"oh man when i heard this band i was like WOAH like awesome! i can't get enough of them, thier lyrics are great thier music is great its like...great!by the way i'm deaf"
5,Awesome,"Last year in the spring I went to my local punk bar, Java Jazz, Finch and Starting Line was headlining and that was the first time I had ever heard Finch. Immediatley I fell in love because there music is a perfect mix of hard core and music such as Blink-182. All I can say is this is one of the best cd's I own. I would reccomend this one to anyone. Songs like Post Script, Perfection through Silence and Without You Here make this cd encridible."
1,pitiful,"Perhaps this vocalist should take some of the money he has made selling his sorry excuse for a music album to buy himself some voice lessons. And if he has already had voice lessons, someone should take away that teacher's right to teach. Seriously, when will people learn that they shouldn't embarrass themselves like this? Just because you can scream and play some fun little I, IV, V chord progressions on a guitar doesn't mean you should start a band. What's ven more pitiful is that people actually pay for this stuff and think it's great! You people amaze me."
2,I'll probably sell this on eBay,I am disappointed in this book. I was expecting a book which takes you right into practicing Yoga but the first Chapter is all about the author's youthful years in England and India. Then the next Chapters are on meditation. I got bored and put it down and haven't picked up it since.
5,The Best Yoga book I have read!!,I have many books on Yoga and this book I am having a hard time putting down. Everything he says is so easy to understand and you are able to relate to each page. I decided to write this before I am even through with this book since I am so enspired by it! I can't say enough about this book!! Thanks so much for letting me see the true beauty of Yoga.
4,"Good tank, if a little heavy","For the price, this is a good product. Solidly constructed and works very well. It's pretty heavy, but if you can't afford a carbon fiber tank, it's just something you have to deal with...With my Ion, this tank lets me get through roughly 5 tubes (just over half a case) of paint before it starts to run low. If you shoot more than that without a break to refill your air, this is not the tank for you. Get a higher pressure tank and/or a bigger capacity one.The size of the tank seems just right to me, but like I said, it's kinda heavy.Note that this is the first tank I've bought so I don't have a wide basis for comparison. As such, I can recommend this tank in its price range, but with the qualification this recommendation is in isolation (rarely a good thing)."
2,Not as Advertised.,"Item received was not the item advertised. A lesser grade Pure Energy Tank was received (I read the part numbers off of the picture provided in the advertised description, of which was not the same as the item received) and the regulator on the item was not the Pure Energy regulator assembly that is on the picture description provided in the advertisement. If you order from Dorosports, be prepared to not get what you ordered!"
3,Good deal if you don't mind Glue,The product arrived and assembled easily. It looks quite nice.Cons: After a couple week one of the supporting legs broke off. They don't have much to hold them on. I was able to mend it by gluing all of the legs in place with wood glue. I have no problems since then.
5,Great Buy,The coat rack was very easy to put together and it looks great. We hang several coats on it and it's pretty sturdy. Great purchase for the price.
5,This is the jewel of Reiki !,"I read this book while I was trying to recover from a seriousback condition. I was given a grim prognosis from my doctors and decided to pursue this last ditch effort to getwell. My soon-to-be teacher gave me this book to read in contemplation of my first degree, and I devoured it ! The personal accounts by our Reiki heroine Hawayo Takata were SO wonderfully touching, it'sas if the stories themselves were emitting healing energy !There are so many Reiki books out there, but this one is the jewel of Reiki, because it brings forth the genuine flavor of the Orient in a personal and inspiring fashion ! I have been a practicing Reiki teacher for 11 years, and this book still has my heart !Buy this jewel !""Reiki Sue"" Deutschlander"
5,Reiki - its history and power,"Reiki: Hawayo Takata's Story is a simple, beautiful explanation of what Reiki is, the history behind it and the power of its healing abilities. Clients generally experience deep relaxation, may even fall asleep and notice the heat eminating from the giver's hands. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a clear explanation and personal experience the help their understanding of what may happen in a session. Reiki is non invasive, is done fully clothed, can be done with someone sitting in a chair and can be done long distance. It is by far the most powerful tool I have learned in my massage career. And I can do it without the physical issues that sometimes arise from other massage, i.e. shoulder issues, hand problems."
4,"Nice, but expensive",Great portable tripod stool. Well made and sturdy. Telescopic legs balance well and work smoothly. Extremely light and easy to transport. Carrying case is nice. Only negative is the price. Lowered price would make it perfect.
3,Company has no customer service,"I purchased the 26"" XXL Walkstool several years ago and have used it many times (100 or more) and have high praises for it's comfort. But quality is questionable for a $90.00 stool. One time when using the stool I lost my balance and tipped over with the stool. When that happen one of the legs wouldn't fully retract. So I contacted Walkstool directly asking for a replacement under the warranty. A company ""executive"" wrote me back saying it was misused and not covered under the warranty. But he would sell me a new one for half price. So I ignored this jerk and contacted the retailer directly. They replaced my stool, no questions asked. But really, the stool isn't made that well. Even my replacement stool has issues with the legs not fully locking."
2,Important information not given,I need a strong stool or chair to support 300+ lbs.. I will not buy a product unless the support rating is given. It is amazing a company would not know how important the support rating is for a stool and/or a chair. no sale.
4,Walkstool,"As advertised, stable on different terrains - pavement, dirt, grass, cobble stones. Was able to pass it off as a camera stand and umbrella at a weekend outdoor music concert that didn't allow chairs. Attracted a lot of attention from other concert goers."
5,Great help in getting up to speed on VBA quickly!,"The book was an excellent source of information on VBA, and VB for the Office apps not yet supporting VBA. If you're looking to build quick intergrated solutions based on Office97 this is a great resource. It definitely helped me out in creating a number of solutions for our organization."
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD, IT IS NOT A CD IT IS A CDR, A FAKE BURND COPY THERE IS NO SUCH CD! THERE IS A MFKR CD THO BUT THE MFKR CD ON AMAZON IS A FAKE THE PERSON SAID THERE IS ONLY 666 OF THEM MAKDE WHEN MFKR HAD 1000 MADE CUZ THEY WERE DEMOS"
2,It's not large print.,"It's not large print. I had to buy another bible that was large print. i wanted a parallel Bible in large print, but this is not the one."
1,10pt Font DOES NOT EQUAL Large Print,"Zondervan's description of this Bible as being in ""Large Print"" is a complete misrepresentation. It's in 10pt font. Dinky print would be a more accurate description. ""Large Print"" is generally defined by librarians as being at least 16 pt. <...>Other than the small size the Bible is fine.I returned the book to Amazon."
4,I love this Bible and glad I got it,"This is the second Bible I have owned and I love it. My study of the Bible grew past the living bible that I have, and I was reading it and the kjv open bible at the same time. The print is not what most would consider large but it is good sized, I mostly read the amp. version but it's great to just be able to look over and read the kjv right beside. Only thing I wish it had was some introduction and theme and other things like other bibles have, but I guess it would get pretty huge if it had all that in it being parallel and large print. Over all a good buy, and the lowest price I have found for this Bible, especially it being the bonded leather version."
2,Not Large Print,"Two things wrong with this Bible: the print is small, and the footnotes even smaller. Even with my reading glasses, it wasn't worth the effort. Second, the King James version is out of date. Who reads the KJV? The NEW KING JAMES VERSION is available and much more realistic. When Jesus speaks, he doesn't sound like a stuffed shirt. Don't buy this product."
4,interesting,interesting view of soldiers in the roman army at a far post in the hinterlands. the level of detail is enough to keep the flavor of life good and the roughness of life in that time not enviable. The author has made me feel the hard life of a non-com.
3,A CD of Hits and Misses from the new leader of Styx,"Whether it's Tommy Shaw, Dennis DeYoung or James Young, whenever these guys make music on their own, they can create good music and they can create fluff. Like his other prior solo releases and even Damn Yankees work, Shaw gives us both the good and bad on 7 Deadly Zens. Shaw scores big with rockers like The Ocean and Down on the Ground. Usually when he slows it down though, I hit the fast forward button. I already had Straight Down the Line on a B side on a Shaw/Blades cassette single. The song bored me then and it bores me now."
3,great songs/filler,I love Shaw's voice and sound but at least half of these songs are filler.The opening cut is fantastic and I wish most of the rest was as good.
1,One Deadly CD!,This is the most forced CD that I have ever heard! I am soooo sorry that I bought it! It sounds incredibly uncomfortable...like slow dancing with someone's great-aunt Bertha! I can't even put into words just how bad this CD is. Only buy this CD if you don't mind wasting your money on a glorified frisbee.
4,A Romantic Sleeper,"Crossing Delancey tells the story of two people from different socio-economic backgrounds who meet and stumble to try to form a relationship. Izzy is a young professional who meets Sam through her Jewish grandmother's matchmaker. When Izzy learns that her ""match"" sells pickles she's quick to try and hide her date from her friends. She's also quick to judge. Meanwhile, Sam has wholeheartedly fallen for Izzy, oblivious to the fact that she's a little embarrassed about his job. Can she overcome her preconceived notions about the man?"
3,Before it's time.,"With the popularity of Romantic movies today, this movie would probably do pretty well if it were released now. Different look at a single Jewish woman's singleton."
4,Why!!!,why review something I enjoyed?are you in the business of movie reviews? You do well in getting the items to me in good time.that's all I expect.
5,CROSSING DELANCEY - ROMANTIC COMEDY,"This film (I saw it on tv) shows the bittersweet side of love.After watching this film I realised that the person for me was metaphorically right under my nose and it made me realise that sometimes when a person has their ideal mate set in their mind they may fall for the wrong guy/girl and lose the person who will truly love and respect them for real. You'll cry, smile and learn from the experience. If you like Nora Ephron's romantic comedies then you will love this one."
4,A Little Kick For Your [Tush],"I checked these guys out because I heard them on the Scorpion King Soundtrack...title track for this cd. I had to check this cd out.It's good, rockin' music...nothing not to like. Vocalists voice is decent and the music is very cool. Got some guitar solos too, which have almost faded away in the rock world.If you are looking for something new to listen to and tired of the rap-metal stuff, this is for you...well-worth the purchase.Among my favorites are Sherman, Burn It Black, When She Comes and Bullet."
1,POP and BORING too,"MONEY was what EVE had on her mind when she recorded ""EVE-OLUTION"". If you expect this to be a rap album, I'm sorry, it isn't. It's POP. I wish I could tell you it's good pop, I'm sorry, it isn't. Britney Spears has written better lyrics and Mandy Moore's songs are more interesting. I'm glad that EVE is doing other stuff right now, like movies and fashion because her rap career is over in my opinion. EVE'S CAREER R.I.P."
3,3.5 stars,"Eve goes for a little more mainstream, pop/R&B hip hop style here. Many jump to call this album a sell out, but I disagree. Sure, it is a little different of a sound, but it fits her nicely and she sounds comfortable. The main problem with this album is the production. Several of the tracks have very lame, poppish production from newcomers that just doesn't cut it. Eve's skill is still here, maybe not as present as on Scorpion. This is a pretty good album. It's a nice listen. Not as good as her sophomore album, but still better than her debut."
5,Worth every penny,"I am a thirty-eight year old white woman and a major fan of rap. My friends don't get it. I don't care. This music is the most original and honest stuff out there these days, and Eve-oulution is at the top of the game. This album is solid from the first track to the last. I listened to it at the gym tonight and couldn't keep from moving to the beat. Watch the old white chick go! Worth every penny."
4,Strong Debut,"When No Doubt's self-titled debut album was released in 1992, it was a huge flop. The band were extremely popular in their native California, but this upbeat, ska influenced album was lost amongst the depressive, downbeat grunge music that dominated the scene at the time. The music is classic ska, bright, sunny, lots of horns. You can hear the influence of bands like The Specials, The English Beat and Madness coursing through the album. Although the music was in stark contrast to grunge, the lyrical content is not that far away. Songs like ""Ache"", ""Get On The Ball"", ""Move On"", ""Doormat"" & ""Sinking"" take a cynical and down-trodden view of life. ""Trapped In A Box"" is the top song off the album and laid the groundwork for the more pop-ska sound of Tragic Kingdom. The album isn't as tight as their later album, but that can be attributed to their rawness in the studio. Overall, No Doubt is a strong debut and an excellent record in it's own right."
4,"though not for everyone, it catches the spirit of the band..","If you loved ""Tragic Kingdom"", and found yourself to be dissapointed with this album, it's probably because you're not a ska fan. No Doubt IS a ska band-- they just experimented more with rock sounds on ""Tragic Kingdom"". Also, much of the second CD was fueled by Stefani and Kanal's break-up. I found this CD to be highly energetic, catching their true-blue spirit, and if anything, Tragic Kingdom should be considered a dissappointment for letting go of some of the energy. The self-titled is the only No Doubt CD to feature Eric Stefani, the group's founder. This is a treat, because I found his work on the keyboards to be superb. Gwen's voice is still in the works on this CD, as are the lyrics, but this truly is No Doubt."
3,No Doubt,1. BND 5/52. Let's Get Back 2/53. Ache 3/54. Get On The Ball 3/55. Move On 2/56. Sad For Me 5/57. Doormat 1/58. Big City Train 3/59. Trapped In A Box 5/510. Sometimes 5/511. Sinking 4/512. A Little Something Refreshing 3/513. Paulina 2/514. Brand New Day 5/5
1,Poor Pop,"Going by the majority of the customers' reviews displayed here, I opted for this one instead of Tragic Kingdom. Baaad move! This is your typical synthesizer-heavy light pop that predominated in the 80's. Not at all the ska/reggae influenced music that I was expecting. Truly trashy, truly forgettable."
3,Okay,"This album by 'No Doubt' is good for a debut. Tragic Kingdom is much better. Most of the songs on here sound the same! The best songs are 'Let's Get Back' and 'A Little Something Refreshing'. I must say, I'm not a big fan of ska. Buy TK instead."
4,their only good CD,"this is no doubt's only good cd. it blends good ska and reggae styles, and they don't have this huge focus on the 'pain and travails' of gwen stefani's life. eric has most of the influence on this cd. buy it! great sounds from their pre-selling out times."
2,bongo flat,"We bought this bongo for our grandson because he loves to bang on things that make cool sounds. These bongos have loose heads and only make a flat thud. Would have liked instructions as to how to tighten the heads. I googled that but they all talked about tigntening the bands with the screw tighteners-obviously intended for real musical instruments, not toys."
1,Disappointed,"This was a gift for our grandson whom we would see in a few weeks after receiving the bongos at our home. When we gave them to him, we were very disappointed in the skins on the bongos...particularly the large one. ""Tight as a drum"" was not a fitting description as it was wavy and didn't produce the right sound. Then we took it from him so that he wouldn't use it (another disappointment); and, we would return it for a refund when we got home from our visit."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Completley beyond the fact that these tops barely cover Barbie at all, they won't stay closed because of the button on the back that makes the fairy wings flap so you can't even get them on. When I did manage to get he blue top on it kept popping up over Barbies assets because it was so small. Really dont' bother, this is a waste of money!!!"
4,"2009 silverado, ext. cab. 67"" box","raw stainless, good welds, little lighter than i expected(weight), nice deep tone, sound good when put your in it. little louder than I care for but I wouldn' t remove it."
3,"Good lock, bad accessories","Pros:This lock works! I live in Boston and left my bike out over night one time with the frame locked to the front wheel and a railing. In the morning, the rear wheel was missing! :( But, to my surprise, when I examined the lock there were obvious bolt cutter marks that failed to get through (mostly just damaged the vinyl coating). So this lock saved part of my bike!Cons:Keys. They seem to be made of aluminum or something. My key (lost the spare) has about a 90 degree twist and a crack in it. I suspect that from my habit of just jamming the key in and turning without seeing if it's all the way in. I'm very careful now when I unlock it, but it still works!Mounting. No problems with the part on the U as someone mentioned earlier, but the part for the bike is cheap plastic and the bouncing of the lock during my rides stripped the threads."
3,Not for Beginners!!!,"It's a decent video. He takes a different slant on the banjo than scruggs. I agree with the above poster NOT FOR BEGINNERS. This is definately for intermediate level people. It's really about improvising. So if you aren't improvising yet, stay away."
2,Disappointment,"Although advertised as a product for beginners, it offers nothing about how to use the instrument itself. After I have learned the basics, this may be a useable product."
1,Not a Jorgensen Bar Clamp!,This clamp is painted orange to look like a Jorgensen Bar Clamp - it is NOT! DO NOT BE FOOLED!
5,Great Movie,This is a wonderful movie. My daughter loved the Casper cartoons so much I thought that she might like the movie. She loved this movie.
1,Spit!!!!!!!,"This album is a spit!! It has some mean songs, ugly talking, badwords and more. This is just as bad as part 1 and AFD. GNR'S ONLYGOOD ALBUM IS GREATEST HITS. The best song on this CD would probably be Civil War. GET IT THE RING is one of the meanestugliest sexiest druggiest songs ever!!!! Estranged is just assad as other gnr songs.

3,"album not great, doesn't stink","While in my younger years I was a pretty big ""Guns"" fan, it's lessened now that I'm approaching thirty. This album contains some extremely bright spots, such as ""Yesterdays"", and ""Civil war"", two songs that will go in the ""classic"" category for even the most casual fan. But there are rough spots also, songs that seem to be little more than filler. Worth it to check it out, especially at these low prices."
5,Best Guns N' Roses album,"This is the best Guns album of them all. The band sound like they have matured alot but keep the angry, aggresive lyrics of ""Appetite"" in many songs. The songs are all very differant, ranging from hard hitting songs like ""You Could be Mine"" and ""Shotgun Blues"" to some of the best emotional songs written by Axl ever with ""Breakdown"" and one of the best songs I'v ever heard,""Estranged"". Civil War is also a brilliant song.The band all contribute to the songs, with izzy on vocals for two of them. This album is essential for Guns n' Roses fans, and for anyone who loves good music."
2,Oh Dear,"There are some classics on this, and there are a lot of disasters, the production is shoddy at times and the extensive use of a piano is really ridiculous. The first five tracks up to ""Knockin On Heavens Door"" are good, especially ""Civil War"". From there the album takes a downward spiral into inexcusable ineptitude, I mean, some of it is really really bad, ""Get in the Ring""??? Come on! The album recovers for ""Estranged"" and ""You Could Be Mine"" but finishes poorly with the god awful Vanilla Ice-like ""My World"". You could tell they were trying to make a classic and were too careful and trying to be too perfect, Appetite For Destruction was a classic and it seemed carefree, but this...oh dear.Combine this with the good stuff off of Use your Illusion I and you have a classic."
1,Dull erotica,I found the stories boring with too much homosexuality. I can not imagine anyone claiming to have written most of this dull supposedly imaginative tripe.
5,Great way to increase calories,This product is wonderful. It dissolves easily and is tasteless. Great for increasing daily calories but not the amount of food consumed.
5,Excellent quality paring knives--always my first choice,I have owned these knives for a couple of years. They are sharp and easy to use. I do sharpen them on occasion and they keep a good edge. I like these so well I take them on vacation with me to use in my kitchen away from home. Excellent value for the price.
4,Rada Paring Knives,I bought one of these knives years ago and it has been my favorite paring knife. I ordered a set of these for my mom and myself. They are great knives.
2,A disappointment,"The illustrations are very faded, especially the maps. My old dog-eared copy of this book is still much better. Too bad, because the information is good, but not a good printing job."
4,Good text for advanced students,"Chapman's book is a comprehensive and well-written entomology text. Not only does he cover all the basic topics in entomology, he does so in depth. This text may be too detailed and overwhelming for begining entomology students but is great for more advanced students. The one problem I have with this book is that Chapman often uses jargon without defining or explaining it, leaving the reader to look it up or remain confused."
4,Work well,"These were a gift. There were black smudge marks on the skin part I had to work at to try get off before wrapping as a gift. The person I bought these for is a well honed drummer, but a bongo beginner and he is having a lot of fun with these! You can tell by looking at them that they are not a high quality set, but perfect for beginners. He also liked the fact that you are able to tune them. It is what I expected for the price."
5,And the Muse spoke solemnly...,"A dark night and a good pair of headphones. Just relax and the let the music wash over you. ""It will be all right...""Not ""darkwave"" or ""ambient"", something a little different for those tired of music designed by demographic."
2,a passably derivative first effort,"For all of the talk about individuality and creativity in this genre, unfortunately, ""Mercy"" sounds more like B-sides from those artists from whom Falling You obviously draw influence; Love Spirals Downward, Miranda Sex Garden and Lycia. Musically this disc is sometimes adventurous. Vocally and lyrically, ""Mercy"" is jaded and uninspired. You're better off buying from the artists Falling You is impersonating."
1,never gets where it is going,The music sounds hopelessly dated and out of step. The melodies wander and never really take hold. I would agree with some of the other reviews - there are MUCh better examples of Ambient music out there. Pass on Mercy.
4,Great book!,"This is a terrific book that will help a parent move through the stages of adjustment to their child having special needs. It acknowledges the grieving process that most parents experience, while giving parents some things they can do to help them move towards a temporary acceptance of the situation. It introduces parents to the idea of meeting their child where they are and helping them grow to their greatest potential, rather than trying to ""fix"" the child and make him/her ""normal"". It also talks about the behavioral issues some kids with special needs have and encourages a parent to try to understand why the child is displaying the behavior instead of simply reacting to the behavior. It even moves on to talk about how a child with special needs effects the parents as a couple and the more typically developing siblings. In short, this book is a comprehensive discussion of all the difficult and wonderful things of having a child with special needs. I highly recommend it."
5,Bells of Coronado,"I really enjoyed the movie, but there are couple of scenes that might not be suitable for younger kids."
3,PUNK ALA FRANCO-AMERICAN,"Like Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zepplin suddenly referring to themselves as The Honeydrippers, Guns N' Roses take a punk vacation on ""The Spaghetti Incident?"" covering a bizarre choice of covers that include punk kings The Dead Boys and The Damned, a doo-wop 50s classic, ""Since I don't Have You"", and an uncredited murderer Charles Manson song. The album begins with guitarist Slash doing a spaghetti-western guitar bit in the intro of the doo-wop classic and then the music gets very British and very punk with a genuine anti-social anger stemming from god knows where. Spaghetti westerns, punk classics, doo-wop, profane lyrics, England, Charles Manson, put it all together and what do you got? I don't know. But like what Peter Townsend once said, ""There's a message in here somewhere."""
2,Who are they?,Thy can't be the real ones!!!!!!!!! A relly bad album and...wher's the great Izzy Stradlin'?
4,The Punk Incident?,"The Spaghetti Incident was to be the final release of the now classic lineup of Guns and Roses. Instead of going out with a bang, the band went out with a whimper caused by fighting and egos within the band.That said, this album isn't entirely bad. The band picked some of their favorite punk (and one or two non-punk) classics and put their spin on them. The video for ""Since You've Been Gone"" got a fair amount of airplay and video time back when it came out.If you're a fan of GNR and are curious where their roots come from, then by all means pick this up. If you're a casual fan looking for the hits, then move on. There's nothing to see here."
5,"Their worst album, but still a great album","This isn't as good as AFD, Lies, or UY#1 & UY#2, but it's still a great album even if it is a cover album. Hair of the Dog, New Rose, Human Being, and Raw Power are the best tracks. I know it's been said before, but there is a hidden song written by Charles Manson at the end of the album. Just listen a little bit after I Don't Care About You and you will hear it."
2,mediocre,"Only get this CD if you have the first 4 studio albums and want more, or enjoy the songs/style being covered. It is sold at a bargain price for good reason. I often forget about this fifth studio album, but as a GNR fan, am glad that they released everything they could in their short career. I usually just listen to the first track."
4,A Lot Better Than I Thought It Would Be.,"I figured this album would be like a two star thing when I bought it. But I was quite suprised when I found out it was very good. Apart from several mediocre songs, this is a great album of classic punk and hard rock covers. Some of them downright stink, which is why this album only recieved 4 stars. But some of them rock like there is no tommorrow. Often Axl Rose makes strange sounds with his voice. If you are looking for the heaviest GNR song ever, check out Ain't It Fun with its almost death metal chorus. This is a great bargain for any hard rock/metal fan, but if you are a beginner on this band, I would advise you to check out Appetite For Destruction or the Use Your Illusion albums first."
1,BLUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH,"Eck. I was wondering why i hadnt heard any of these songs on the radio? I knew it was the last thing they put out, and listning to the other albums and becoming a gunners fan, i bought this album and found out why i had never heard of any of these... this album is terrible. Its a bunch of cover songs and the only one I could stand was ""hair of the dog"" a cover of Nazereth... This album was terrible, they didnt sound like they where having any fun making it, and it lacked any GnR spirit...this without doubht the worst GNR album you could ever buy!"
1,Saying this cd is mediocre is being too kind.,Anyone that says that this is a good Guns n Roses cd is either in a state of denial or are smoking some pretty good weed.If you want some good GNR music buy Appetite For Destruction and then downlowd a few songs off of their Illusions cd's and make a greatest hits cd.Save your money and stay clear from this mess.
2,Not Really Guns N Roses,"The Spagethi Incident? The bands 1993 album and the last too feature most of the original members. Honestly its not really that good and is pretty cheap. Look the whole album is a punk tribute album, obviously they didnt really care about this album AT ALL. Though there are some good tributes like there tribute too Hair Of The Dog is good but honestly its not really worth your money. It is a hard rocking album but the thing of it is, is that it just isnt really them, and most metal fans dont like punk so why would they come out with a punk tribute album. This album is only for those who want all of Guns N Roses albums or just like punk tribute albums."
4,Underrated,"Ok well a lot of people have slandered this cd but if you can respect a lot of punk/punk rock music such as the New York Dolls, The Damned, Iggy Pop etc, then this is brilliant. It's so listenable and it's still rock n' roll. Duff McKagans vocals on New Rose, Attitude, You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory etc., are catchy. This is what inspired the members of Guns N' Roses so you might want to remember that. It's just a good album, simple as."
5,Great Dado Blade,I'm very impressed by the quality of cut you get with this blade. Flat bottom cuts with no chip out. I was most impressed when I was cross cutting veneer oak plywood without a zero clearance insert and the cut was prefect every time with no chip out.
5,Awesome stacked dado set,"The first thing you'll notice is the boxed set and the weight. Without even opening the box, you'll will feel the heft of this dado set. Once opened, the outer blades have an impressive number of teeth (with the Freud anti-kickback shoulder behind the tooth).The instructions are clear and the measurement guide is sweet. The metallic shims allow for fine adjustment though they could be better indentified (if unsure, make sure you measure with a dial caliper). The most impressive part is in the cut - flat smooth and no tear out.After using several other dado sets, including a Sears and the SD208 this design and function is simply the best cutting."
3,check carbide carefully,"This would've been a 5 star, except that I had to send the first one back. About half the carbide teeth were chipped or had pock marks on them. Cutters were dirty and had finger prints all over them. Not sure if someone had a bad day at the factory or this was return. The exchange process with Amazon was seamless and the second one had none of the issues the first one did. In addition it cuts beatiful dadoes - flat bottomed with almost no tearout."
4,Great blade,"I purchased the blade based on numerous reviews in magazines and on on-line forums. However, it does leave scoring marks on the outside right blade. Other than that a 5-STAR purchase. Also the price was great too!"
2,"Rust, rust, rust","I haven't even been able to try this set yet. First set came with shims all rusted together plus some rust deposits behind the outside cutter teeth. When spending $200 on a dado set you expect the condition to be pristine. Replacement set was sent and had even more rust deposits than the first.Spoke to a foreign based cs agent who said that all they could do is offer a refund on the set. I asked why it wasn't possible to check the replacement set before being sent that it was free of the rust. Didn't get satisfactory response.I'm sure that this set works really nicely per the ""FW"" review, but don't want to start off with a rusted set and have to buy third party shims."
3,Enjoyable for the most part,"Is this another ""overly attractive 20 somethings on an outing full of casual sex and the intake of intoxicating beverages and recreational drugs""? Yes. Is it better than most of that type of movie? Yes. Was it worth the rental? Yes. Would I buy it for future viewing or to add to my collection? No.This is at the top of the list for this type of stereotypical movie. Best of its genre that I have seen in a while. I generally dislike this type of movie with the usual cadre of impossibly attractive friends joining together for a recreational getaway only to have everything go to hell but this movie happens to be a great example of that type of movie so some sort of kudo's must be made for it thus my review.A very worthwhile rental."
3,Every hex key you wanted in a case you'll hate,"I prefer these types of loose keys to the pocket-knife sets since they require less room to use. This particular set contains all of the keys I've ever needed for electronics and home repair, and then some.The smallest keys I cannot see using, since I've never seen a hex screw that small, and I'm sure it would bend or break with the required torque.Like the other reviewers, I agree that the case is horrible. I keep the whole thing in my tool chest drawer so that it's not tossed around but still cannot seem to keep the small keys in their place. Fortunately, the large ones--the ones I acutally use--do stay put.This set is the most expansive of the ones I've seen for sale here, and still recommend it despite the problems of the case."
4,A Big Change of Pace for G N'R,"I was in high school when AFD came out - it was a revolutionary album. Suddenly even spoiled preppies found hard rock cool. I bought the follow-up, G N'R Lies, when I was in the military back in 1990. Although I was into heavier music at the time, I immediately took a liking to the four acoustic songs and I played them almost exclusively, rarely playing side one. As the one reviewer below mentioned, I too wish this whole album would've been acoustic. To this day, I consider G N'R Lies, side 2, to be one of my favorite album sides ever. The four songs just flow together perfectly, always leaving me wanting more. I would've paid full price for just the acoustic songs on this album. It's now fourteen years later, and although some of it may be sentimental, I can still sit back and enjoy these great acoustic arrangements. -1 star for side one, which never really grew on me."
4,Cool,I think this is an ace album who cares about the lyrics or the song titles? I think frontmen shold be allowed to say what they want when they want simply because they have the right to. So forget about all the 'offensive' rubbish and listen to the songs not the abuse. This is a good album to listen to in any mood because of the variety of songs on it.
4,"Good, but not essential","Lies is a combination of the four tracks of 1986's out-of-print ""Live! Like A Suicide"" EP and four new acoustic tracks. ""One In A Million"" was controversial due to its racist content, but ""Patience"" and ""Used To Love Her"" are among GnR's finest tracks. However, since Lies is so short, I would recommend Appetite for Destruction and the Illusion albums first."
3,"Departure from other work, but lukewarm","This was a little odd for a band like Guns N'Roses to put out, especially since they were at the point in their career that they were. It's not their last effort, The Spaghetti Incident?, which left people going ""Huh?"" and scratching their heads, but it was rather a collection of acoustic efforts. Their famous power ballad, ""Patience"", was one of their biggest hits, but the rest was lukewarm.If you're going to do an album as a complete departure from what you were doing before, you have to give it 100%. This was clearly put together in a few evenings of just sitting around and playing and left the producers to mix it to perfection. It seems to me as a spur of the moment decission that they put this together then decided to releast it. And that ""One In A Million"" song with the supposed apology on the front cover? It was stupid to print something like that, and it was double stupid for them to release something like that for other than publicity."
1,ABSURD,"This is a lousy excuse for ""music"". Other than the poorly sung ballad or two that are recognizable on this piece of trash, this album is an utter downer. It does well, however, to demonstrate how this band lacked creativity and talent... ultimately leading to their demise. THIS IS THE WORST LEAD SINGER IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK AND ROLL. I WISH VINCE WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVIN THE CHANCE TO KICK THIS SCRAWNY WEASEL'S A**."
5,This is the one to buy!,"Over the last several years I've gone through roasting pan after roasting pan. Inevitably, they all come to the same end. The bottom of the 'non stick' pan fails and burnt on stuff refuses to come off without taking the finish with it. And then the rust... rust in the bottom of the pan and rust on the pan rack. I've bought so many pans and inevitably this is what would happen to each of them. Until this one. This one washes clean every time. The finish is just as good as when I bought it, a year later. The rack is rust free. I absolutely love it!It is smaller than the previous pans I've owned, but I can still easily fit five pork chops on it. Or a large turkey breast. Or a huge ham. And there's also a larger size of this same pan for those who need a bigger size.This pan has been wonderful. And if you have any further doubts... I spied my pan on Good Eats. Hey, if Alton Brown uses it, it must be great!"
2,Disappointing!,"What a waste of my time this was! What a disappointing book from the author of ""The Aztec"". It looks as if he was strapped for cash and sold this piece to anybody who would buy it...Why such an unknown publishing house? Were the major ones aware that his novel was crap? The faults of this story are so many that it would be a waste to count them all.. The man being burnt at the stake at the beginning is no other than the main character of his previous novel. Then he gets to meet his daughter at the end...Everybody keeps running into everybody else, as if Mexico was a three bedroom apartment rather than a country...Implausible lines, anachronistic expressions (i.e. ""palace guards"" referred to some Aztec warriors...). And then sex sex sex. Gary, is anything else on your mind?"
5,gary jennings,I love Gary Jennings Aztec books. I think Aztec was the best one but they are all very intriguing
2,A complete let-down!,"Anyone who loved Aztec as much as I did will only be dissapointed in AZTEC AUTUMN. The charachters are shallow and familiar, the story rushed and not nearly as impressive or believable as AZTEC. I had to re-read AZTEC to renew my feelings about Jennings lost after reading this book."
2,Aztec Lite,"If you've already read ""Aztec"", there is no need to read this book. If you haven't read ""Aztec"", and are intimidated by its length, then ""Aztec Autumn"" may be the book for you.""Aztec Autumn"" covers much the same ground as ""Aztec"": the natives' puzzled reaction to Christianity, the Spanish conquerors failing to live it up their stated ideals, obligatory sex scenes which show how the natives innocently enjoy pretty much anything consensual. Though a sequel to ""Aztec"", ""Aztec Autumn"" adds little to the original story.Gary Jennings seems tired in this novel. There are occasional flashes of his story-telling skills which enliven the story, but by and large, Mr. Jennings seems to be going through the motions."
4,5 outstanding songs...,"I am a long time Crows fan and I would rate 5 songs on the album (Hard Candy, American Girls, If I Could Give All My Love, Miami, And Up All Night Up All Night) right up there with my favorite songs ever (rain king, mrs. potter, einstein on the beach, a murder of one, angels of the silences, a long december, anna begins, i wish i was a girl, etc..). I would also say that 2 songs on hard candy, Butterfly In Reverse and New Frontier, are two of the worst songs they (or any other band) has ever made. BIR sounds like it should have been on the Muppet Movie and New Frontier just completely [stinks]. The rest of the songs are OK, but some could have used a little more pep. My only other complaint is the there is less of Dan Vickrey's guitar than I would like, but other than that a solid album with a handful of sure fire hits. Worth buying just for the 5 songs mentioned at begining of review alone. A nice effort for the Crows!"
3,Inconsistent.,"There are some very high points on this album. The title track is excellent, with interesting Byrds-like guitar riffs. ""If I Could Give"" is quite catchy. Carriage and Black and Blue are bittersweet and downright gorgeous songs. Up All Night is a song I play over and over. These are some of my favorite songs CC have ever done.The downside: I could have gone my whole life without hearing Adam singing about trying on his girls clothes almost everyday(American Girls). Just embarrassing. Goodtime and Goodnight LA are boring.Butterfly in Reverse is not only the worst Counting Crows song ever, it's one of the worst songs I've heard in the last 10 years. Like fingernails down a chalkboard."
2,Disappointing at Best,"As a long-time Crows fan, I was very disappointed in general by the Hard Candy album. Duritz's sound has definitely turned pop with this record, which is unfortunate coming from one of the best songwriters of this generation. The originality of August and Everything After isn't there, nor is the edgy rock riffs of Recovering the Satellites. Some of their old sound come out in Black and Blue, and Richard Manuel is Dead, but American Girls is so syrupy-sweet it makes your teeth ache. For any Crows fans that jumped on the bandwagon with their third original album, This Desert Life, your money is better spent on one of their first two albums."
2,Very dissapointing compared to past records,This album is very dissapointing. It does not live up to the band's past albums that are wonderful. The songs are repetitive and you feel like you've heard them all before. Very little growth. Let's hope it was just a dud and more good things are to come!
2,Hard Candy? Hard to Choke...,"What happened to the Counting Crows? they have gone from the best album of the 90's in my opinion with Aug and everything after to this?> The band i feel needs to regroup and take the musical talent of adam's sad and joyful lyrics which makes the band. I feel that everyband has a horrid album and then followed by a stronger one, it is now your turn counting crows....regroup and create that once amazing sadness that kept us alive and moving."
2,Save Your Money,"Worst of the four albums to date. Despite the lyrics being consistently excellent - the music is instantly forgetable except for cuts: Hard Candy, Miami and New Frontier. The Joni Mitchell cover was stupid, lazy and not gitchy to us 40 year olds who heard Sonny and Cher stink it up on this song, too. Adam needs to find some better song writers."
5,An Excellent CD,"I have been anxiously awaiting the debute of this CD that has been in the works for quite some time. It is well worth the wait. ""This Desert Life"" was a little bit of a let down, but ""Hard Candy"" definately has a little more of what ""Desert"" was lacking. The lyrics are deep and it sounds incredible. ""Carriage"" is an extremely deep and personal view into a miscarriage that truely reflects Duritz's emotional style. I definately rank ""Hard Candy"" as of the Counting Crows' best."
4,My Favorite Flavor of CD,"This album took a few listens to get the feel down, now it is in heavy rotation in my car CD player.As usual CC turns out catchy hooks and meaningful lyrics.My favorite song on this album is ""Black and Blue"". It's perfect for anyone who has just had enough, and is giving up."
5,Good. Fits 2000 Toyota Rav4,Needed to replace front passenger turn signal on my 2000 Toyota rav4. these work and fit perfect. I can always count on amazon to have what I need!
4,Interesting Treatment,I found this an interesting and informative overview of the real Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
3,Horror that's actually funny!,"The title appears suitably oxymoronic, and sums up all my feelings regarding this anthology film. Yes, the components of this portmanteu-film are really well-shot and well-edited. Yes, there are several big-draw names and they do their respective roles a justice. Yes, the entire set-up is really good for a single-viewing, and alas, that is the weak thing that mars this movie for me. Rather than viewing it again, I would readThe Catacombs of FearorThe Faculty of Terrorby John Llewellyn Probert, who had been inspired wnough after watching the Amicus films to write books in the same vein that fortunately have repeat-reading value lacked by this movie."
2,From Beyond the Grave to the Brink of Dreamland....,"I love classic British horror. Unfortunately a superb cast and promising title do not make for an enjoyable experience as witnessed in this film. After the first couple of story, the movie plods along at a sleep-inducing pace. Even the likes of the brilliant Margaret Leighton couldn't save this anthology horror film from losing steam after the first 45 minutes. Skip this and check out the superior Amicus anthology film THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD."
2,So-so AMICUS Film,"I bought this DVD based on the high ratings of the reviewers, but for an AMICUS British film, I was not pleased. It was very average. The 1st two stories were good and the rest were ok at best. Some British movies to buy are ASYLUM, Tale from the Crypt and The Vault of Horror. The last two movies scared me as a child and are great to watch now if you are a 70's British movie fan. I was hoping that Beyond the Grave was going to be just as good, but it is not."
1,Questionable,"The author cites Sylvia Brown as a resource, which is a questionable resource in and of itself considering there are whole websites dedicated to what a fraud she is, but Sylvia Brown doesn't even believe in demons. This makes me question the author's research abilities."
2,not what i expected,"the apron is not cloth at all its plastic like ,still a nice apron but just not what i was expecting"
3,Lesser of the two,"Use Your Illusion II sold more records than part I for a reason. Illusion II has better songs. This record starts off with a number of weak recordings, including the annoying ""Right Next Door to Hell,"" ""Dust N' Bones,"" (1 Izzy song was enough), and a cover of Wings' ""Live and Let Die,"" a song that never should have been a single. The album provides solid efforts, however. ""Dead Horse,"" ""Double Talkin' Jive,"" ""You Ain't the First,"" and especially ""Bad Apples"" are all good songs. But this album succeeded only because of ""Don't Cry"" and ""November Rain,"" two marvellous tunes that were recorded during the Appetite for Destruction era (1987-1988). The problem with GN'R was they worked hard and wrote great numbers when they had to. After they hit it big, it was a slow but steady freefall from the top. As a life- long GN'R fan, I would recommend buying this album only after purchasing the other four records. Illusion I is pretty good, but certainly not their best effort."
3,GNR,"This album has a lot of ups and downs. I rarely ever play it all the way through. They have quite a few hits on this album such as Live and Let Die, November Rain, Don't Cry, and a few others. The most underrated song as this album would be the final track Coma."
5,Masterpiece #1,"Guns N Roses have many excellent albums but when it comes down to variety Use Your Illusion is full of variety. Both parts 1 and 2 are full of variety. But I am reviewing part one here and it is a masterpiece just like the second part. Not that their other albums aren't masterpieces.Ok, this cd is as perfect as Guns N Roses gets if there is such a thing as perfection. Every track has a mood of its own and that is what makes the Use Your Illusion discs so special. There are songs that make you laugh, cry, party, depressed, happy, angry, anarchist, quirky. It's all here. Get them both. Every rock, metal listener and quite franky any music lover should have this in their collection."
2,one good song,right next door to hell is the best song in this album! the lyrics are not so good. this isn't made for you! appetite was much better!
1,Epic Fail!,"How did GnR fall so far in only one album. It usually takes a band several albums before their creativity peaks(im looking at you Metallica). How does a band gain legend status by having one classic album and one(yes one album, dont try and tell me illusion I and II are separate, it was just a way for the record company to bleed the fans) truly awful, overproduced, pretentious, ego-maniacal, train wreck. There is one AND ONLY one song worth listening to and that is You could be Mine. It could have easily been included on Appetite for Destruction and should have been the direction taken by Axel and Co. Just think of what could have been."
3,Repetitive at times,"I enjoyed this book, but it was pretty slow in many places. Toward the end, it was quite exciting. But the first half of the book seemed to go over the same material repeatedly. It needed to go faster. IMO, there was also not enough action. It was mostly Braden telling himself over and over that he had to uphold the Cause and couldn't have Cassidy. It just went on too long."
2,Dissapointing!,"I was probably in a state of a temporary insanity - I ended up ordering two of these: one in black and one in silver. The quality was way below average. At close inspection, I could see that some of the pieces of mesh were already out of place, ready to fall off. The clasp looked as if it was going to disintegrate just after a couple of uses. Conclusion: I shipped it back. Lesson learned: An evening purse should be of impeccable quality and I will not fall for a cheap imitation next time. Self-respecting women beware!"
3,"For the great Toscanini, a so-so collection","Revelations: the Dinorah Overture, Rustic Wedding Symphony excerpts, Mozart Divertimento and Copland's El Salon Mexico (which I didn't even know he had performed). Disappointments: The Kalinnikov Symphony, which is too fast and stiff in the first movement and, in the second, Toscanini rescores the viola ""drone"" effect of the opening of the movement for harp which ruins the desired effect. Downers: the inferior music of Bizet's ""Jolie Fille du Perth"" suite, and that dreadful, boxy Studio 8-H sound, and the Massenet. Delightful surprises: the Sousa marches, especially ""Semper Fidelis"" which he conducts like a tarantella, also the unidentified chorus on the Dinorah overture (most probably the Westminster Choir, which Toscanini used in those years for his Beethoven performances).Overall, then, a nice collection that fills in some gaps, but primarily for ""complete"" collectors only. As an overall album, it's just OK."
2,Out of touch,"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is the worst book I've ever read by Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut's usual rapid-paced prose and intense dialogue is largely absent in this somewhat preachy novel about wealth and charity. Though there are a few interesting scenes which may save the story from total failure, both the plot and main characters remain underdeveloped throughout most of the book. This was the first (and hopefully will remain the only) Vonnegut book I have ever struggled to finish."
2,"Nothing ventured, nothing gained","God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a perfect example of a canned story. Nothing about this book could be considered excellent, nor original. The alleged wit of Vonnegut makes no appearance in this bit of tripe. The only somewhat redeeming facet of this book was the fact that everyone in it was useless: the Senator who obvioulsy bought his way into politics, the absent-minded heir to a fortune unearned even by his father, and the helpless souls of Rosewater, IN. Perhaps that's what this story is all about; reducing everyone to the same mean, useless status, and then showing how a ""great"" person will love them regardless. What a load of tripe."
3,"It's not his best, but it's clearly Vonnegut","Okay, so God Bless You... may not be the the best thing Vonnegut's ever written, but Vonnegut on an off day is still well worth reading. This book has all his trademarks, from biting social commentary and blazing satire to dark humor and quirky characters. It's a speedy read that will make you both laugh and wince by turns. Don't make it the first Vonnegut book you read -- for that, I'd suggest Slaughterhouse 5 -- but if you're a fan give it a whirl."
3,"Not one of Vonnegut's best, but a good book.","GOD BLESS YOU MR. ROSEWATER was a fun book to read bit it went nowhere! Until I got to the last I was waiting for something exciting to happen, but that excitement never came.The story is of Eliot Rosewater who is the president of the enormously rich Rosewater Foundation. Eliot gives money to anyone who asks and gives everyone his kindness and love. But Norman Mushari, a nasty lawer, is out to prove that Eliot is insane and the family foundation should be givin to a distant cousin.This book was published in 1965 and was one of Kurt Vonnegut's first 5 books. This is a good book but definately not one of the esteemed writers best.This book is a fun quick read, and I would recommend reading it, but anyone under the age of 15 it would bore the hell out of them."
4,Wonderful book,This book takes an interesting look as the simbiotic relationship between a town and its benefactor. I love the lessons learned and it makes you stop and think about the current structure of our society.
3,A nice read,"Kurt Vonnegut's book, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is about money, power, and greed. The main character, Elliot Rosewater has abandoned his amazing lifestyle in New York to try an experiment of the human soul. He is a drunk, fat, dirty, and rich. He has a lot to give to the world and spends his time doing nice things for people, yet these people are so pitiable, they don't deserve it. Not everyone is happy with Eliot's work. Lawyers try to find him insane and unable to use the family fortune. The books switches between the lives of people Eliot helps, the depressing lives of some of them, the lawyers attempt to find Eliot insane and some Rosewater family history. Vonnegut makes you question Eliot's insanity or his overly niceness to the very end. It also questions the class system in America. The book has its funny moments. Overall it was an alright book and I recommend it if you want a quick, humorous read."
1,.........,I think that it was made crappy and that the screw already broke before I started to use it! I think that it wasn't worth the amount that it was priced for!
4,Easy Speakers For Ipods,This is an easy and simple speaker for your Ipod but it has to be fairy close to hear. I wanted it for my car but doesn't work due the the lack of noise level.
2,Do Not Buy,"These speakers , if you want to call them that, Suck. You can only hear them if you are in perfectly quiet situations.I recommend that you don't buy them."
1,Unusable after three months,"After I'd used mine regularly but not constantly for about three months, it developed a high-pitched whine that hurt my ears and gave me a headache. It was also annoying that there was no light to remind me to turn the switch off and stop draining the battery, but that's probably typical of this kind of product. I like the size and shape of it, and the sound quality was adequate for my needs (listening to podcasts) but it just didn't last."
5,I love it,"I've bought this shoes here in amazone.com because they are sold out in Germany!! In February I was in the adidas outlet store in Herzogenaurach here in Germany. There were a lot of shoes, also these shoes. But in the wrong size. I must have these shoes!! So i looked everywere in the internet, no one have these shoes. A few weeks later i've seen the shoes here in amazon.com....Immediately I bought the shoes. Yesterday I got the shoes and I'm so happy now.Very nice shoes in best leather and excellent quality.Everybody will have a lot of fun with these shoes and reach best goals!!"
5,Work of a master!,"Just like movies (Godfather, Citizen Kane, Annie Hall) there are certain comics you HAVE TO read. Comics like Maus, Dark Knight Returns, and A Contract with God come to mind. For me, Arzach is certainly on that list.Moebius is an undisputed master of comics, but in the U.S. his work has yet to be seriously collected and made currently available. I suppose at some point (probably after his death, unfortunately) the entire Moebius library will be published properly, but until then it would be nice to see just this one volume of Arzach available again. The art, compostions, mood, atomosphere, and the mechanics of storytelling in these simple but richly detailed short stories are among the most beautiful ever created in the comics medium and should be read by (and made available to) all."
4,Nice case,I purchased this case to organize my SD cards. I carry them in a backpack and was tired of using individual cases. This case is sturdy on the outside and the cards are kept in place on the inside. The only weak point would be the latch keeping the two halves together. I will see if it holds up.
4,Good Buy,"I bought this after i realized how irritating it was to keep all of my SD cards in separate little cases. This one has a good external build, and holds the SD card well for when I am shooting out in the public, it is fast and convenient to have all my memory in one place. My one complaint: even though I have only had it for about a year, the hinge is getting very worn out and I am afraid that it is going to break at any time. But still, for the price, you get a good metal case, and it can also hold the micro SD cards for my phone!"
2,"Nice, but too heavy","Very heavy for a case of this size. The aluminum is nice, but probably overkill for protecting memory cards. I won't end up using it."
5,love them,I received many compliments on these earrings. They are very comfortable to wear.I would certainly recommend them.Hoping to buy more
2,A necessary evil,"I have Quickbooks 2004 and was forced to purchase this new version at full price. If you buy this product, make sure you are ready to buy it again in 2-3 years - and don't expect a discount. It does a good job as a simple accounting package, but be prepared for a barrage of advertisements in the software trying to get you to buy/upgrade to monthly services such as online time-sheets or payroll table updates."
4,"Helpful, but overwhelming","it's avery nice comprehensive set, probally the best out here, but they can be hard to use for studying."
4,Very Cool Indeed,"The notecards are helpful when you need to review information and do not have the time to scour a textbook. The notecards do not cover information in detail(as they are notecards)but they hit the best points which is all you can ask for when you're in a rush.You can organize the information by categories, numbers(dates) and however else you want. They are hole-punched which is so much more helpful.The information was pretty helpful especially with information I had forgotten and had never covered. It gave me the basis to do my own studying in the areas I was weak in.I would recommend them---if you are actually going to use them."
5,WOW!!!! Where have she been...,"I loved everything about this album!! It was the most uplifting album I have heard in YEARS...Every track was tight. Most of the tracks were very inspiring. At times very spiritual. The music had me bouncing my head on every track, great beats. A must own!"
3,not bad...,I really don't know anything about or ever heard of Jerzee Monet before but when i saw & heard Most High (feat. DMX) on some music channel i do have to say it caught my ear(or eye or whatever).I think it's a little different and can get stuck in your head easily. she really does have a nice r&bish reggeish voice.
3,"""Hella Good"" in disguise","I guess someone beat me to this review. Anyway, I've waited almost a month for my Tour EP to ship and it turns out its totally not what I expected. I thought it would be live tracks from the last Rock Steady tour and the yet to be released ""New Friend,"" but it turns out to be the ""Hella Good"" single with an alternate sleeve binding. I wish they would have done a REAL Tour EP, not just released the same single, but I'm a collector so it's not a huge deal. If you're looking for live tracks and b-sides, this is not the place to get them. This contains, ""Hella Good"" (album version), ""Hey Baby"" (OutKast 'Stank' Remix), ""Hey Baby (Kelly G's 'Bumpin' Back Baby' Mix) and ""Hella Good"" (video). Only for the hardcore fans."
1,disappointed,"So, It is christmas eve and my order never showed up. I will check on it Monday but will not order from here again. It has been over two weeks. not acceptable"
5,My Opinion,I am currently in school to advance my knowledge in the electrical field and this book has been an asset.
2,Product lasted me almost a year.,"I hate losing my screw drivers and tools. My friends get them mixed up or use the wrong ones. So these kits are the one thing that keep me from loosing my tools and keep me and friends from using the wrong sized tools.I was working on a plastic gear shifter for a racing game, when 2 of these screw drivers from the kit broke.I already have had the larger philips heads stripped from normal wear and tear which is not a sign that this is a good quality product. Then when unscrewing a screw from a piece of plastic while working on the above mentioned gear shifter, i had 2 of the flat head screw drivers come loose on me.So now i have 2 ruined screw drivers, and 2 others that are useless because the head spins around and the grip just freely spins around it.Only buy this product if you have the money to throw away or for some reason cant find another kit to buy.Again this is a poor quality set, buyers beware."
1,not worth it.,I would say its not worth the time it takes to write this review.....1) the case: the tools should sit inside the case neatly but them all over the place when u move it...2) The Tips:the tip are not straight well most of them......3) Ok so the tip not straight let use them and see if it works..... its working... spinning actually... the tip begins to spin... oops it fell out... wtf?in the end just wasted my time buying them and wasting more time writing a review... don't bother to look to them
4,Almost perfect,"These are not magnetic and the grips could be bigger, but hey, they do their job. Case could be more durable."
2,No Vertical alignment,"I just couldn't believe it. Out of 16 screwdrivers, 12 had blades bent out of vertical alignment. One, in particular, was bent at least 15 degrees out of vertical alignment! They are useless for the precision work that I do.Why were they ever sent at all?I am sending them back to Amazon.Amazon gets 5 stars for its return policy. They do things right."
5,Michael Stipe meets the Indigo Girls,"I first heard this group on the radioio eclectic webstream. The song was ""Fall Stories."" I noticed over the course of a month or so that every time that the song came on that I paid more attention to it. They have marvelous melodies that you just wished you could hear more of in mainstream music. I found their website and listened to their album. After one listen I ordered the CD and awaited its arrival. I thought they reminded me very much of the early Indigo Girls. Later on I joined their fan club in the hope they might eventually visit somewhere nearby. They are now signed on to the Indigo Girls record label so I hope there is enough marketing power behind them that they get to make a new album. The only weak song on the album is the remake of George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord."" It isn't bad, but just not as great as all the other songs."
3,not as good as hoping,This production of Dark Shadows took all the scary parts and intensified them and left out all the human interest parts that made the soap opera show on tv intriguing to me. I'm looking forward to the new feature production of Dark Shadows starring Johnny Depp.
1,Terrible version,I really enjoyed the Dark Shadow series but this version was horrible. They ruined the story and I was very upset
3,"OK, but doesn't hold up as well as I remember.","This movie is not nearly as entertaining as I remembered as a kid. Not terrible, just not great. The film's strongest moment is the scene with the rapidly aging Barnabas. It is both creepy and fun. The image quality does, however, look surprisingly good considering the movie's age and budget. If you are looking for a great 1970's vampire flick, go with the original ""Night Stalker"" instead.P.S. In order to get the main feature's audio to work properly on the disk, you must set the player to output to simple stereo. It will not function on Dolby-Pro-Logic."
2,I had high expectations for this.,"Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated. The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now. This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better."
2,Boring,"I bought this album because I couldn't buy the ""Don't speak"" Maxi-CD. I thought my hair would turn grey until I'd reached ""Don't Speak"". Gwen Stefani acts like Madonna in her late twenties although she'll never be as good as Madonna. Copying someone or being someone is not the same. I don't know if they wanted to give the listener too much of their ideas or they didn't have ideas at all. Anyway, the result is an under-the-average and boring CD."
5,fantastic,This product was great... I love all my vinyls but this one just made my collection... I would recommend this to everyone that loves No Doubt...
4,It was cool...,I think that Tragic Kingdom was a fine CD. There were only one or two songs that weren't interesting. They do just fine singing together. Maybe I would recommend it.
1,Can you say...Prima Donna,Well... I bought this CD apon hearing Dont Speak (the only song I like besides Tragic Kingdom). Spider Webs was stupid garbage (leave a message and Ill call you back? What the hell is that?)Dont buy this CD. Its terrible.Its a untalented lyrical nightmare.
4,Welcome to the kingdom of No Doubt,"This was my intro to the band and I must say that it was a good one. Gwen has an amazing voice and she puts it to work well on these high-energy tunes. The best ones are ""Spiderwebs,"" ""Excuse me Mister,"" ""Just a Girl""(my personal favorite from the album), and ""Don't Speak,"" which is such a beautiful song despite the downbeat nature. The main reason why I didn't rate it perfectly is that ""The Climb"" drags on a bit. A few songs were a bit weak like ""You can do it."" It's a must have for current fans and serves well as an introduction for new fans. Worth the buy."
4,An average albumn,"I love No Doubt. I am a faithful fan. But this cd did not thrill me. Some songs are great, i.e. ""Don't Speak"", ""Spiderwebs"", and ""Tragic Kingdom"" but after the first few songs you get bored,(well, at least I do). All the songs sound the same to me. I mean, it's a great buy, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. but it's kind of...repetative."
5,i LOVE this cd!,"This is a great CD! In my top two No Doubt CD's for sure, but I don't know if it is one or two. Every song on here is great... my favorites being the powerful Don't Speak, Sunday Morning, I'm Just a Girl, and Happy Now, loving every other song on this CD as well, of course. A must have in every No Doubt fans collection, it is deffinetly a No Doubt classic."
5,guns n' roses live era '87-'93,i think the ablum is real good. it's the first one they come out with live in consert. i can't wait till they come out with another one. i have all their cd's they came out with.
1,they suck,"wow how could they ever become popular. Oh i know why it is because of slash. now i must admit he is a great guitar player but i just dont get axl rose wath a bum. his voice is almost worse that the blink 182 singer (almost). But seriosly has any body been listening to the same album i am i mean if it is i dont know what youre problem. I know the problem is that half of the people who reviewd this album havent even heard them. they just want to be cool so they go get the t-shirts from myrvens and pretend to like them so they can fit id. The other half are deaf, or have never heard real talent. over all dont get this album if you dont like a screechy voice that breaks glass blasted in your ear dont get it."
1,absolute tripe...,guns and roses what can i say except for the fact i hate them with a passion any questions about this non talented band.....
1,GUNS AND POSERS,"one of the biggest flash in the pan bands ever, i hate this band, i don't understand why they are so god damd famouse for being posers. axle is the (...)singer in existance, he should (...)."
1,Stupid,Overated product by a overated bandand ps the singer sucks more than any thing else in the world :)
1,Just let it go people.... this 80s hair/glam trend is over.,"I can compare this album to people trying to get over a dating relationship. While it is at its prime, it is all fun and games. Then later you realize it was a waste of time to begin with. But later you find it hard to let go of something that wasn't good to begin with.People it is 2005, this album is very dated and these ""bad boys"" were elimanted by 93... Move on already.."
2,CD Reissue please !!!,"The rating is for the CD sound quality , which is lousy. Way overdue for a reissue. Get with it UMG !!!"
3,"A few good songs, but d'ya think it's loud enough?","Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine are the only songs worth the money to get this album. Other than that, well...some are okay, but a few of them suck something severe."
5,classic !,"too often mislabled as ""heavy metal,"" Appetite For Destruction stands as an undisputable landmark album of hard rock. everything about this album is a classic, from the killer artwork, to the controversy of the band, and the amazingly solid rock and roll. dirty, sweaty, young, foollish and real."
3,All downhill from here,"When you listen to this album, you will think of what might had been for this band. This was Guns N Roses first album, and the only one that made any sense. The songs in this one sum of the rest of their music careers-- WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE.If IT'S SO EASY, why couldn't they do better and better albums? Well, the rest was probably written on that NIGHTRAIN. Slow and boring.It certainly didn't become a PARADISE CITY around this band, as they kept claiming the critics are OUT TA'GET ME.No, they just needed better lyics than ANYTHING GOES.MR. BROWNSTONE pointed out what probably was the real truth-- too much booze and drugs to keep it going.If only they has listened more and tried to THINK ABOUT YOU, they would have written better songs. No, YOUR CRAZY was the reply. We are the best.Well, this was the best album, but that isn't saying much.If you only want one G N R album, then buy this one. Half the songs are OK, the others are so-so.That is why it barely rates three stars."
2,Never Understood Why?,"This is Guns'n'Roses best album according to most. I'd agree, but it still sucks. Guns'n'Roses are white trash; their music is so stupid. People argue that the 80's were a horrible time for rock. The truth is it was one of the best times for rock, the problem is the mainstream music blew. People were listening to Guns'n'Roses or The Motley Crue, instead of good music like Stiff Little Fingers, The Clash, Gun Club etc. Not into punk? There was still plenty, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Pixies etc. Yet people waste their time with bands like Guns'n'Roses."
5,A masterpiece,This album is a masterpiece. An album that will be heard for ever and ever since it has really catchy and amazing songs. If you like hard rock then this is the bible. Welcome to the jungle - Its so easy - Paradise city - My Michelle - Sweet child o mine. What can we say about these tracks? They are cool upbeat easy - listening - and they will last for evr. A must buy for anyone.
5,I think....,"I think...that this is Guns' best album yet! Although I love there other stuff, this album is just untouched, there are so many hit songs on this one album it is just unstoppable. Highly recommended for any rock fans, or guitar fans.I mean hey....ITS SLASH MAN!"
5,The Best CD By Guns Ever,I have the is on cd and tape. I got it when I was in the 8th grade and still love it and I am 30 years old now. It has the engery that I have not experience with other bands. And it touches me in ways that other music can't. When I am up set and listen to Nightrain and start to sing to it I start to feel better. Its just strange. If you want an album to make you think about stuff I say that this will do it. At least to me it does.
5,Welcome to the Jungle,I enjoyed this CD in high school in the 80's. I still enjoy this CD. Guns N Roses has a unique quality to their music.
2,Give Credit Where Credit Is Due!,"C'mon without Tracii Guns this album would have never been possible...""Sound never repeated"" Get an L.A. Guns C.D. Moron! Why doesn't anyone wonder why Axl was never able to duplicate this success, and why he always relied on cover tunes? BECAUSE TRACII WASN'T THERE TO WRITE THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also why Axl is sitting on his rich fat butt and Tracii is still rockin' out with legends like Nikki Sixx! Because Axl was a no talent hack! Tracii Guns Rocks Axl was, is, and always will be a wannabe!"
5,"quite simply, the best album of it's day....","this is music for music listeners. the album was written by those who could care less about making money off of their music. listening to this glorious compilation, it's obvious that these people weren't interested in entering the mainstream. actually, it seems quite clear that they were trying to avoid such things. the result - pissed off, bluesy, gutteral brilliance. unfortunately, they were never able to recapture the essence of this work, as they (like many others) became millionaires, and multi-platinum celebrities and seemed to have lost sight of what made them pioneering musical masterminds. if all you know is welcome to the jungle and sweet child o' mine, BUY THIS ALBUM immmediately, and understand why people write and listen to music with this 'mud-covered gem' of american musical history!"
5,A Rock Classic!,"This has to be the best GNR album.This is the album for any and all fans of GNR.This album contains the classics ""Welcome to The Jungle, and ""Sweet Child of Mine"",to of the Gun's best songs.I coudn't find anything wrong with it.It is the one album any fan of rock music MUST HAVE!!"
5,tear jerker ending for Nam Vets,"The movie is a truly great video for those who don't know the protocol that goes on behind the scenes when a Combat Veteran, who dies in combat, returns home for burial. One of the ending scenes that will bring many Nam Vets to tears, happens when Chance's, father, does his walk by of the coffin at the cemetery. Welcome Home My Brothers!"
5,"Finally, Honor Presented with Taking Chance","THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL FILM. FINALLY, HONOR AND DIGNITY IS PRESENTED HERE AND EVEN THE WORST OF OUR HARD HEARTED MUST SURELY BE TOUCHED WITH THIS DOCUMENTATION OF A FAMILY RECEIVING THEIR BELOVED SON FROM HIS SACRIFICE IN IRAQ WHERE HE HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND IT'S VALUES. THIS IS THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN AND UNDERSTAND. IT TAKES YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE AMERICAN MARINES RETURNING ONE OF THEIR FALLEN HEROS AND ALL THE ASPECTS OF THIS LONG TRIP HOME. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING YOU FEEL HONORED AND GREAT PRIDE IN THE WAY THIS YOUNG MAN IS CARED FOR AND THE DIGNITY WITH WHICH HE IS HANDLED ALONG EVERY SINGLE MILE OF HIS JOURNEY HOME. I FEEL LIKE I KNOW THIS FAMILY AND THIS WONDERFUL, YOUNG MAN. GOD BLESS THEM AND ALL OUR YOUNG MILITARY. AND, GOD BLESS AMERICA."
5,Our soldiers in Uniform,"This was a fabulous movie on how our returning military in caskets are treated by their own fellow soldiers. Very poignant and even tho a tear jerker in many places. Dignity that we need to see our boys receiving. Once again, a must for everyone."
5,Superb!,This was so much better than I expected. Everyone should see this show. Bacon was superb! A definite sleeper that needs to get out there.
5,Wonderful movie!,"This movie is a tear jerk-er. It depicts a true story about accompanying a soldiers remains home after being killed in action. Kevin Bacon does a great job and the whole movie is very well done.Anyone would claims to be a patriot should see this movie. My husband and I are so glad we purchased it. I had heard about the movie from one of the talk shows and we don't have (I think it was) HBO to have been able to see if and it's wasn't offered on demand, so I'm am very glad we purchased it!"
1,Not for true music lovers,"The song selection on this CD is excellent - it covers most dances and basic rhythms. However, the interpretation reminds me of cheesey 70's lounge music. Not something I'll be pulling out to practice with or listen to!"
3,Warning: English-to-Esperanto only,"Be warned--- this dictionary is English-to-Esperanto only. If you are learning or using Esperanto in any way, you will need a dictionary with an Esperanto-to-English section as well. I recommend the one by J. C. Wells.While this dictionary is very comprehensive, I still use my Wells dictionary much more and find it more reliable. Neither dictionary indicates whether an Esperanto word comes from the Fundamento or is official. The CEED does keep some of the more recent neologisms in a ghetto in the back of the book, however. (I'd rather see the neologisms in the dictionary proper, but marked, and perhaps with a more common Esperanto word given as an alternative.)I believe that any English-speaking Esperantist who already possessed the Wells dictionary would get some good use out of this more complete, but one way only dictionary."
5,Great Album,I loved this band when I saw them in 1981 in California. This has always been a favorite album. Glad to get it on CD!!!
2,"Nice Lock, But Key has jammed","It's a nice lock. I bought it to replace my Krypto, after the viral video of how to hack the Kryptos. It worked good for about 2 years and has been a solid U lock -- but now the key will only turn half way - jams in the middle. I have oiled it and cleaned it - cant fix it."
5,"good, sturdy lock","I have this lock for about a year now. The lock is just about the most comfortable size - small enough to carry along, long enough to lock to most things. It's very sturdy, feels very hard to cut through. I also started to get some jamming especially in rainy weather, but oiling the mechanism solves the problem. I'd recommend it if you are happy to add oil once a year."
1,I'm Ready... to be a one-hit wonder,"Cherie's voice is matured enough, no dobut about it. [...] It's almost like if she was a 13 year old girl non-prodigy (unlike JoJo). ""It's Your Love"" sounds horrible and ""I'm Ready"" is destined to be one-hit wondered. The only thing the star for I give is ""Fool"" which sounds better than the rest.Cut it off your wish list."
5,Deck Planter,Love these planters! Super fast delivery. Thanks alot. Hope to do business again soon!.
1,"DEK DEKOR RECTANGULAR PLANTER 2X6X24""",I ordered the rectangular pot but never received it because it was back ordered. A couple weeks went by and it still did not arrive so I called the shipper to find out what happened and was told it would ship in a week without any explanation for the delay or why they never e-mailed me to give me the status.I called AMAZOM and complained about the shipper and lack of customer service.Next thing I know is a notification that they were crediting my account.
5,Great price,These are the cutest pots for my rails on my cottage rental at the beach.Tenants love to garden in then with herbs or flowers. Great price but can't findAnymore on amazon.
4,Great Book,This book is a great read. Lots of helpful information. The seller also did a good job. I never had any issues during the transaction
4,A must-have book for students of art,"George Bridgman is a fantastic figure artist and teaches life and figure drawing from the ground up. His drawings are beautiful, as he teaches the student several ways of imagining each piece of the human form.Any artist should get this book, study it, and copy every drawing, regardless of his skill level."
4,THE LAST BOY SCOUT/THE LAST MAN STANDING ACTION DOUBLE FEATURE [BLU-RAY],"I had never seen either of these movies, so I was taking a chance. For less than $10.00 I had to go for it. It's Bruce Willis for Pete's sake. I thought both movies were really pretty good. The blu-ray was pretty good in both films also. I didn't expect them to have as good video quality as they did. I can't judge the audio because I don't have surround sound, but it sounded ok to me. I like the fact that they were both in 2:40:1 aspect ratio. This way I can see the whole film & not have the ends cut off. They all should be like this. I would recommend these [2] films to anyone who is a Bruce Willis fan. I don't think you will be disappointed."
2,Region Free?????????????,"Why does the studio NOT want the rest of the world to see these movies, why only Region A???? I think it's extremley narrow minded to NOT make these Bluray titles available!!! Also "" Little Shop Of Horrors "" "" Evita "" the same."
5,movie,"movie arrived quick and in excellent condition, was very pleased and will be ordering more movies in the future."
4,the writer has a diferent tipe of writing about the,his quind of writing has a special way of refer the portuguese way of life and costumes. Also is known because he dosen't submet himself to the price of money
2,Teddy's greatest hits,Teddy Pendergrass was one of my favorite singers. This cd does not do him justice. It sounds forced and unprofessionally reproduced.
5,Da Kush,"Roll dat S**t, Light Dat S**t, Hit Dat S**t, Hold Dat S**t, Blow Dat S**t out Slooow...Then pass it to me, Bro..."
5,Most incredible....,"I bought this album when I was about 11 on vinyl. (that was 1971). Unbelievable. ""Chest Fever"" was what really hooked me, although the entire thing is killer. Three Dog Night proved, once and for all, that they could ROCK with the best of them. Besides all the girls screaming in the background, the mojo must have been right on this evening for the guys as they sounded TIGHT... One of my favorite albums of all time."
3,Only fits PanaVue,Woudl not have needed it anyway as the bulb that came with Kaiser viewer did not burn out looking at over 2500 slides some multiple times
3,Good But Overrated,"Eric Clapton's self-titled debut is actually a disappointing mistep. ""Easy Now"" is a beautiful ballad, and ""Let It Rain"" is a classic, but the album as a whole is just a bit too mellow, and the all-star cast of supporting musicians simply overwhelm the main attraction. In light of the masterful performances Clapton was recording as part of Derek & the Dominoes around the same time, the overall weakness of this album is astonishing."
4,"Great, for Amazon's special price","I have the original V3 Razr, and although this is nicer in many ways- I miss the flipstyle that protected the screen. Its also very small and easily lost, I've lost and recovered mine a couple of times already. The 100 song limit on iTunes is fine for people like me, who mainly want to use it for audiobooks. There is no arbitrary size limit for mp3 files, so put big files (albums) on instead of individual songs! The built-in speakerphone works great!"
3,Really Helpful Book,Yes I agree with the other reviews that there are a lot of type o's but the code on the CD is correct. Anyhew if your worth your weight in java to begin with you would be able to see the mistakes and correct them they're not that difficult. The book is well written and the jdbc api is explained very elegantly. Good job Matthew. I would however give the publisher and editor a piece of my mind if I were you about the type o's. Nasty!The code on the CD does make up for it though. Check it out.
4,Excellent Global view.,"Ok, now I'm informed ;)Even after reading the lyrics I say it is a good tune. Video is great too. So, big deal if it pokes a little fun at America, but, I believe it also shows how powerful and great America is. People DO want to be US, and YES America is everywhere, like it or not.I think the song is more of a tribute to this, with a bit of a poke at the current administration regarding the dance our way or else.(PS BIGBADVOLF, you were right about WONDERBRA, I hadn't read the lyrics at that point, but your review ?? , way too serious, and possible off the mark (or is that Euro:) ) ).B"
5,To Be Shared,"Steve Wood's, ""Christian Fatherhood"" has had a continuing and growing influence on me. Having been married fourteen years, my wife and I have had our share of challenges. The wisdom and charity within this book has helped me be a more loving husband, a better father and has given me the confidence to teach my faith to my children."
4,"Good professor, bad student?","I was taught by one of the authors, Alexander Demitrious Poularikas, way back when this book was brand new, and he the new Chairman of our Engineering Department at the University of Denver. Unfortunately I couldn't understand it all, but I think it was because I'm stupid, not the books fault (well, I was slowed down by personal problems). Anyway he was a good teacher, and that's why I wanted to write this review, not because I liked the book:)"
2,Common Sense,"""It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.""- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."
2,Beware! Only 70 min.,"Most silent films, damaged by the course of the time, exist in different versions of different running time, but when a DVD is released is supossed to be the most complete version existing (for instance, the Flicker Alley DVD of ""La roue"").Well, this is not the case with the Kino ""The outlaw and his wife"" (price: 27 $ !). This is a very truncated version and shouldn't have been released in such conditions. Its running time is only 70 min., when nowadays exists a version of 105 min. that I have seen four or five years ago in the Madrid Filmoteca and in the french TV channel Arte.The truncated Kino DVD version is, I suppose, the existing in the Kino shelves and released in VHS many years ago. That's very bad !Not to speak of the nasty tinted of ""Terje Vigen"" in the companion DVD, that destroys the range of grey light and shadow of the original."
3,Okay if you have small hands.,"This is toy is great when kids come by and want something to do other than watching TV. But like the title says, it's made for small hands. On a side note, my dog loves playing with it."
3,Not as good as his other novels,"OK, I enjoyed reading this novel. The plot is well constructed at first, and there is a lot of action and suspense. But I was also disappointed. Unlike in the other novels the main characters - above all Joanna Blalock - are not really consistent or believable in their presentation, with the exception of Sinclair. The ending is a real surprise - but too many questions remain open. Some lines of the plot just stop or fade away without a logical explanation. I prefer the other Blalock novels."
5,Hit The Deck,"Hit The Deck, is my favorite musical, with Jane Powell. The music is fantastic, and she was my favorite singer and actress in musicals. The movie is about sailors & girls and a musical production. All the actors are great, and the singing and dancing wonderful. I would reccomend this for everyone who likes musicals. It is well worth viewing. I hadn't seen this movie since it came out in 1955, as it never was on TV, that I could see. Thanks, Amazon, for making it available. It is a spectacular film."
2,Wrong book,"This is not a review but a chance to say I intended to order ""Nothing Daunted"" by Dorothy Wickenden but somehow received the one by Isobel Kuhn which I am not interested to read. Hal Cowart"
5,Inspirational.,"It is a book that will give their respects to the children who lived in such unbearable, inhumane, and thriving conditions that modern-day child could never exceed"
5,incredible,"while i am glad a read this i would not recommend other children reading this.this book was written in such depth and truth that no author could ever write something like this. accounts of terror, death, hope, love, and despair can not be ignored as you travel into the mind of a youths trying to cope when the world descends to chaos in front of them. millions of people died in World War II and the Holocaust, the least we can do is read their words and remember them. they may have lost there chance at a future so let us not also lose their past."
4,Spider-Man,"While this is a classic Spider-Man scene, the actually quality of the image is not very good. The image of Spidey is blurry. Other than that, this is a very cool poster."
1,Not firm!,"Was very disappointed when I received this roller. It collapses as you try to roll and make adjustment to your back, making it difficult to roll on."
5,fantastic for whiplash patients,I love using this roller between trips to the chiropractor for my neck and back. I was in a car accident that left me with residual whiplash injuries and this definitely helps!
2,Horrible shipping,"Shipping for this project is just horrible. I know that shipping is often bad these days for 3rd party vendors on Amazon, but I shouldn't have to wait 3 weeks for such a common product."
3,Foam Rollers,"The roller is smaller than 6"" and one of them is bent so it makes it difficult to use. Quality control was not asleep."
5,Great company,I had a small problem with getting a differnt color roller compared to what I thought it was going to be. I did not read the description but John was very helpful and is sending me a new one. This company is great and will do work with them in the future.
3,It's ok,"Not a high quality but it does the job. Not finished off like the ones in stores, a little rough"
1,foam roller from JCA Sales,"Apparently not all foam rollers are created equal. If you want one for therapy or workout purposes, the one from JCA Sales isn't the one. Theirs has a very rough and fissured surface and at the same time appears to have inconsistent density and is kind of spongy in places. The ends are cut off rough and are unpleasant to handle. It works neither as a firm bolster nor as a softer support. With its poor surface, it is uncomfortable to use. This one is not at all like ones sold elsewhere (OPTP for example). It might be good cut up for packing materials; that's about it."
5,"Foam Roller 6"" X 36""","Prior to purchasing this item I had used a similar foam roller in physical therapy for remedial spinal exercise. I knew that the product needed to bear my weight (172 lbs) without collapsing or flattening. It had to retain its rigidity to be effective. I couldn't be certain from the literature exactly how sturdy it would be. Given the asking price, it would be a real value if it measured up to quality requirements. I decided to risk it.I was not disappointed. The roller has in no way deformed after repeated use. It has retained its shape and rigidity.The item was well-packed for shipment and arrived in a timely manner. I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
1,Compresses too easily,"I had read the review by the customer who said that this roller became compressed with use, but I dismissed it, thinking he must weigh 300 lbs. Well, I weigh 110 pounds, and this roller became compressed into an oval shape soon after I bought it. Needless to say, it no longer rolled. I tossed it in the trash and bought a dense black roller at my local runner's shop. What a waste!"
4,great nerf product,"Great product for adults and kids. It's the classic Nerf football, but with an exo-skin and hard exterior that can even handle landing on concrete or asfault. It weighs more than the original nerf, but that just lets you throw it into the wind. This is my second one, after the first split at the seam after 2 years of use. Definitely worth the money."
5,i dont think they can make a bad cd,"ive had this cd for a couple weeks now, dont ask, and ive listened to it an unnecessary amount of times, and i must say that while, imo, not as good as a predators portrait, its still damn good, better than most music coming out of america today, one of the better melodic metal cds ive heard outside of opeth, very sweet."
2,Sorry to be the bad guy....Weakest worst album yet:(,I didnt think Solwork could make a BAD album either till i heard this one.Where are the solo's?Where are all the harmonies?Wheres the SPEED?I was luke warm to Natural Born Chao's..but it had better riffs and way better song structure's.Most songs here get caught up in the same riff..one after the other.And the chorus's have started to become mundane..very overkilled.If you want real soilwork..listen to the first 3 albums:)Only songz i give a small plus is Figure Number Five and Overload.
2,Sell outs?,"Hope not..I dont know there are a few good songs here and there but in the technical side they are slipping. you can make songs that are both commercial and technical like the ones before but these songs sound too popish. The songs are ""ok"" composed but they lack the technical spark that made you catch your breath.Hope they do better on their next album."
4,Were all too tragic...,"ILLOGICAL MAGIC..its a great CD.. Stabbing the Drama is better.. but their work is far from disappointing.. i was impressed.. My favorite song on here is Brickwalker and Light The Torch.. it is great..The only reason this Cd got a 4 instead of a 5 was the song ""Distortion SLeep"" its good.. but NOT that great.."
4,The Sound May Change...,"well i was so excited of such an amazing band coming out with yet another album i took the liberty of downloading it 2 weeks before it hit the US (because that's when Europe got it). this is a slight departure from soilworks previous album (natural born chaos) and a few thousand miles away from the bands debut (steelbath suicide) but with that said, I LOVE THIS ALBUM! it had less throaty growling and yelling then on the previous albums but it doesn't take away much from the sound of the band, it still has screaming just incorporated more melodic singing, witch is great. the only reason i gave this album a 4 instead of 5 is because the synth can be a little overpowering and some of the aggressive guitar work isn't as apparent but i would still recommend this album for its hardness to any metal fan or even any skeptical death metal fan, give this CD a try, it grows on ya! headbanging maturing great sounding band, no matter how much they change they still kick ..."
5,Happy with my Makita RLS1220,"The Makita was delivered in six days. Everything was in excellant condition. I have had no problems with the saw and I love it! The larger size blade is exactly what I need in order to cross cut the various sizes of lumber I am working with. I believe the 12"" saw will work better than the sliding 10"" compound Makita. I encourage anyone who would go with a 10"" to step up to the 12"" blade."
4,"It's obvious, and sad: Lanier will never publish #3","An 8 is pretty high for me, and means that I literally have been looking for this book or its sequel for over a decade. Dozens of bookstores and libraries, and finally, through the wonders of the Web and amazon.com, I got an out of print copy of Hiero's Journey and the Unforsaken Hiero. I suspect that Mr. Lanier, unfortunately, is no longer with us, which will leave everyone who has enjoyed his wonderful works wondering what might have been. If I am wrong about Mr. Lanier, or the fact that there are no Hiero sequels, please do correct me."
5,Answering the question: Where is Sterling Lanier?,"I met Mr. Lanier in 1984 at a book signing in Frederick, Maryland. Shortly after meeting him I heard that he was working on the third Hiero book and had it written in his mind; however, he suffered something that may have bee a stroke, and the memory of this unwritten book was lost to him. I heard that he was trying to reconstruct the book, but I do not know if he was able to or even if he is still alive. Regardless, we owe Mr. Lanier a debt of gratitude, not only for Hiero, but more importantly, for a book we all know as a classic in the genre. Frank Herbert brought a manuscript to Sterling Lanier after being turned down by virtually every other publisher. By his own account (one that I have not verified, so there is your caveat), Mr. Lanier was, at the time, an editor for Chilton, and he had the intelligence and foresight to publish this book titled ""Dune"". Thank you Mr. Lanier, wherever you are!"
4,Fine book for reviewing,"The SAT Math II tests both cover a wide range of topics. One cannot expect any one book to cover them all. This book tries its best to cover all topics but it should not be a replacement for a precalc / algebra II textbook - only a supplement. It gives you tips and tricks to master the SAT tests that one might forget such as trig methods for calculating areas for parallelogram and triangles.If you have a strong background in math or have taken a precalc course, this book should almost be a breeze. It covers all of the basics but only touches upon more complex subjects such as binomial combinations and polar coordinates. But the author does have a point - your chances of seeing those questions on an actual test are very slim.All in all, this book won't let you down"
2,Bladder leaks,Used 1st time... Leaked. Very disappointed. Went to use during an adventure race and darn thing leaked. Very very disappointed.
1,horrible,this book was one of the worst books I ever read it had no point at all. I would defintly never read it again
5,Feels Great and Works Well,"I love this product. It works like a toner and my face feels great (not overly drying like a lot of firming serums). When I put my moisturizer on after the serum the layering of product doesn't feel heavy.I don't worry about absorbing excess parabens and other problematic ingredients. Many products have ingredients (like preservatives) that actually age your skin and then add moisturizers to just make it look younger. This product doesn't age your skin, so it takes a few extra weeks to for you to see results. But the results are well worth the wait."
1,Tedious reading,"I found this to be a tough read. I normally enjoy reading about primitive heros, but normally a romance author will portray them as somehow more civilized and honorable than the outwardly civilized villains. Gar, the hero in this story, was boring, and the character epiphany I kept expecting never materialized. He never seemed like a fully fleshed-out human being to me. The heroine annoyed me as well. All in all, it was a struggle to finish. I skim-read the last third of the book and heaved a sigh of relief when I was done."
3,DiabetiDerm Foot Rejuvenating Cream,The Diabeti Derm Foot Rejuvenating Cream is good it does keep the bottom of the feet smooth and free of cracking skin. You will notice some dry skin scaling which is not a problem. All in all I feel this is being offered at a fair price.
4,Bulldog? More like Pitbull,"The same price or less than a cheaper ""no-name"" U-Bolt lock from a discount store. And living in the mid-west (close to the distribution center) even with ""Free Shipping"" on orders of $25 or more, it only took THREE DAYS!I already had a good cable - so combined with this OnGuard Bulldog MINI, most thieves will simply look elsewhere. Any bike is susceptible to theft now-a-days. Doesn't matter if you have a $75 discount store bike, a $750 performance hybrid or a $7,500 road bike - lock it up. All bikes need a good lock.Edit: Recently someone DID try to get my bike. They did NOT succeed. Instead, they got frustrated & slashed a tire. JERK. Anyway...combine this U-Bolt lock with a good cable passed through the wheels & most thieves will simply look elsewhere or will not succeed."
2,"Allmost, but not quite","Granville, West Virginia falls through a ""plot hole"" into 17th Century Europe in the middle of the 30 years war. The book deals with the 3000 people in town and what they do when they get there. I found the ""Cheerleader turned sniper"" annoying and less than believable as a cheerleader cheering when new allies arrive in town. There were several ""sub-plots"" that should have either been dropped, or given more attention for example some out of town wedding guests ""imported"" to be advarsies almost dismissed for the rest of the book, they are a problem, but a very minor one. Which leads me to the bigest problem I had with the book none of their problems were ""major"". Every battle they fought was very one sided. And some other battles they were concerned with, they should have been able to open a history and figure out who will win. This could be a good ""first"" book, but it doesn't do as well by itself."
5,Directed Verdict,Enjoyed this ebook very much. It was well written and held one in suspense as to who the trouble maker was until the very last chapter. Recommend this book.
2,"premise great, writing one-dimensional","Don't I wish that judges were as un-clever as the clowns depicted in this story.Sorry to report that truly biased judges, which includes many but not most, are much better at hiding their biases otherwise they would be subject to disqualification and perhaps removal.I did like the idea of a civil trial to recover damages from a theocratic government like Saudi Arabia's - but it all could have been set out and developed so much better.To the reviewers who compare this author to Grisham - not hardly."
2,Overpriced,"This book was free, and,still, overpriced. It is nothing but proselytizing disguised as a novel. It is one long commercial for Christian Conservatism."
3,Enjoyable And Full Of Energy.,"I remember buying the cassette of 1984 around the time it was released when I was in grade school. I used to listen to it all of the time. I just started listening to it again recently and there's no doubt that it's very fun and enjoyable to hear. I can't say whether it's their best release or not because I haven't heard every album. 1984 is full of energy and things get under way really nicely with the opening synth instrumental ""1984."" ""Jump"" is a hit from start to finish and hasn't lost any of its impact after all of these years. My other favorite song would be ""I'll Wait."" That's a good song that shined with the use of keyboards; a Van Halen song with a progressive touch. There's a few songs that don't stand out as much though: ""Drop Dead Legs"" for example. Although I don't think 1984's a classic, it still holds its own and sports very good musicianship."
2,Van Halen Goes Synthesizer!,"This was the first Van Halen album I ever listened to, in fact I never heard of Van Halen till this came out...I was 12 years old back then and was living on a diet of great bands such as Duran Duran, Culture Club and Kajagoogoo. The album cover was cool, a baby angel with some smokes and the back cover of four long-haired hippys who looked like they came out of some nasty trailer park intrigued me...so I put on the album expecting to hear some ... kickin', fist pumpin', beer guzzlin' mullet rawk but instead I'm hearing sappy keyboards as on the intro 1984 and ""Jump"" as well as ""I'll Wait""...I mean Steve Winwood kicks these guys ..., c'mon I want some rock and roll! There's some hard rock to please any rednecks out there [the majority of Van Halen fans] but I for one was disappointed."
5,A Hard Rock Classic,First listened to this album in high school when it came out and in the 20+ years since it still sounds awesome.
5,Better than Bride and Prejudice,"If this title caught you, perhaps you are a Jane Austen fan, or a Bollywood fan, or both. I count myself among the former, and am new to Bollywood, but I'm here to say, if you enjoyed Bride and Prejudice (and I did), check this out. It is much better -- I'm guessing because it is the real deal, Bollywood I mean. The dance numbers are fabulous; the first one alone has 5 or 6 costume changes! And you have to love that the filmmakers take you to exotic and incongruous locations like Egypt and Scotland for musical numbers. Lush visuals, great story, wonderful music and dance, appealing stars -- it's got it all!If you didn't like B & P, but you thought the premise had promise, try this movie."
3,cookies galore,"The book arrived in fabulous condition. I was not impressed with the recipes in this book, though I have been with other of Maida Heatter's books. The woman we gave it to loved it and enjoyed the great detail that Ms. Heatter goes into with each and every recipe. Recommended!"
1,motor died,We rarely used the swing with #1 son. #2 son is just over 2 months.Swing motor died. No replacement parts. No longer in production.SOL Paid full price like $179 a year and a half ago.
2,Bad motor,"This product was great the month 2 & 3. 1st month he wasn't heavy enough & it would go too fast even on the slowest setting. By month 4 when I couldn't on it, it stopped working. Motor complete died out. The company wants me to take out all the screws, sent it to them & then they'll send me a new one. I would like to know what I'm suppose to do in the meantime. Therefore I have decided not to send it yet & push it by hand. My son loves it way to much to be without it for 2-3 weeks. I would suggest buying something cheaper & more reliable. This swing is giving Eddie Bauer a bad name."
3,Great beginning unfulfilling ending.,"I have read 4 of Ms. Kane's books and they have been great all as far as I am concerned five stars this one is my exception because the book captivates you from the very beginning but the end somehow is lacking. Oh please don't get me wrong the romance as always is great no problems or disappointments in that department but for an author that gives so much more in her writting Ms. Kane, as far as I am concerned left me wondering the experience Aurora and Julian in returning the diamond. Or at the very least a more profound explanation of how it was returned."
1,"confusing book. Not well written, probably made in a hurry.",This book often uses concepts and code explained only in following chapters. I should have read the other (bad) reviews on Amazon before buying my copy in a library. Unfortunately I was in hurry. Now I am at page 202 and I am not sure whether I should continue or quit and wait 8 more days to get a better book.
2,Help - I'm in Purgatory reading this Bible,"This book doesn't give the nuts and bolts. There are no real examples, it's all a bit esoteric for me. I have web experience and database experience, but this book hasn't put it together.I should have bought a ""For Dummies"" book."
5,a rare treasure,"Relax in a nice old rocking chair up in the mountains, prepare yourself a pot of jasmine or rose bud tea and indulge yourself with the wise words of Lin Yutang. This book has altered my perception of life and living."
2,Not a big fan,"I bought this pair of jeans for working in. They are not very tough/strong. I already have one hole. And the weave is coming out fast. I will get it patched, but I won't be buying anymore carhartt jeans. Seeing that this was the first carhartt item I have ever bought I also doubt I will buy anything else carhartt's."
3,denim not up to the usual,"I purchase these for my husband. He likes the fit and the pockets. Unfortunately, the denim on the most recent two pair we purchased through Amazon seems chintzy; very thin and I doubt it will hold up as long as other pairs I have bought for him in the past. Even the good brands are becoming so-so on fabric quality, sorry to say."
5,Work Jeans,These jeans are awesome! My husband loved them for work. We ordered two pairs of the same size and one fit and one didnt but still great jeans.
2,"EP, not for me!","This film really isn't worth your time, and it's an EP (extended play) VHS and is very low quality. It should have been issued on a SP (Standard play) VHS, because the tracking is horrible. It will take you an hour just to get the tracking stabilized good enough to watch it. I will not be watching it again anytime soon, if ever. I only give it 2 stars because of Bruce Davison's performance, otherwise it is a one star product."
3,A semi-helpful writing handbook.,"I purchased this book for school, and have found that it is a little difficult to navigate. If I am looking up a particular rule or topic, I can't simply flip to it; I usually end up digging for a couple minutes to find what I'm looking for. I ended up putting a few colored page tabs in the book for sections I refer to frequently. Besides that flaw, I think it's a great all-encompassing guide to writing."
5,I don't like your country music...,"...and so on... BINGO!!! I find my old LP on CD!!!Great tunes! This is a special album, I got thousands of records and this one is there among those at the top...Place a order!!!Janne/Sweden"
5,Brilliant,"Wow. I read this book at the frantic pace I felt as though it was being written in. Therefore it was quick, and I thought, an easy read. I couldn't put it down, and I would encourage anyone to read it immediately."
1,Terrible!,"A lover of all things Quixotic, I borrowed a copy of this from our local library and STILL feel cheated! This is by far the very WORST version of this classic tale I have ever, ever encountered. It's more of an insult than anything else. I gave it one star because the rating system would not allow me to give it none."
2,Mine broke!,"I got these thinking they were a good deal, despite the reservations I hold about buying third-party hardware. For a while, they worked great and I was happy, but a few months after my purchase, the sound cables and the blue input stopped working correctly, resulting in a reddish-green image and a lot of high-pitched beeping whenever I turned on my system. If you want decent HD cables for your Wii, spring the extra 20 for the ones Nintendo makes (they've been working great for me)."
1,"Not just bad, dangerous!","The frame mount for this product is just plain dangerous. It does not hold the lock securely in place and the lock will work free while cycling. This very thing happened to me. Fortunately, the lock only bounced off of my shin, causing pain but not a crash. It seems that retailers (and presumably BullDOg) are aware of this and yet let this inherently dangerous condition continue. I do not even bother using the mount any more.As for the lock itself, after 3 months, the locking mechanism is jammed. The key often does not work. I think the tumblers become misaligned. I have tried wiggling it, shaking it, finessing it, striking it, etc. nothing works. Then, a day or so later, it works again. Again, having read reviews (unfortunately AFTER purchase) it appears that the company is aware of this defect. BullDog is BullCr@p!"
4,Good lock,"The lock is easy to use, and the cable that comes with it is very convenient. However, the piece on the U lock that is meant to attach the U-lock to the bike frame (while riding) is loose, and occasionally slides down. This prevents the U-lock from locking."
1,Locked up!,"Great strong lock, but the lock jammed and I can't unlock it now. I've only been using the lock for about a month. Glad my bike was not locked to it when it jammed. The mounting rack really stinks as well."
3,it is so so heavy,I bought this for my son to have for his bike. I see no way he will be able to ride with this around his bike. It is so heavy. Must be good for when he is home.
2,Unreliable if left for long period of time.,"I had my mongoose bike locked with this U-lock and left it overnight (in Brooklyn projects area) only to find out the next morning that the lock was busted up in pieces and the bike was gone, they probably used a hammer or something. I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of 1 because i don't know exactly how much time it took for them to brake it. One things for sure i wouldn't trust this lock a specially if left on for long period of time. (Note: i used lock alone without the chain)."
1,Strong - maybe too strong!,"I was impressed when I first used the U lock on my new bike. Four days later, the lock jammed. Fortunately, I had not yet locked my bike. I made use of the cable lock and a hastily bought padlock until I could find a replacement. I worked on and off for two days to try to open the lock, following the advice of the manufacturer, but have returned it. I'm glad my bike isn't still locked up somewhere. I won't take that chance with an Onguard product again."
4,"What About Men, and Couples!?","No doubt, this book contains good, up-to-date information. But like the vast majority of books on this subject, it is written for women. While it's true that wives are, on the average, less knowledgeable about family finances than their husbands, that situation is rapidly changing--as is the movement from adversarial divorce to collaborative divorce.For a book that presents both husbands' and wives' perspectives equally on the emotional, legal, and especially financial perspectives on divorce, consider the brand-new ""The Complete Guide to Protecting Your Financial Security When Getting a Divorce"" (McGraw-Hill). It's a book, written by a male personal-finance writer and a female CPA and CFP, that's equally useful for both men and women, either separately, or as a common source to work together towards a truly equitable settlement."
2,"Reviews encouraged it, so I bought both...","... both ""Divorce & Money"" books, that is, one by Smith and the other by Woodhouse. And I have to say, while this book DOES have a lower price, in this case you get what you pay for.Thumbing through Smith's book, I found some helpful information but really, other than stressing that you had to go to a lawyer, a lot of it seemed less fleshed out than Woodhouse's book. Especially if your split is amicable (mine was), a professional needn't be that involved. Within minutes it was clear which book was better, and it wasn't this one."
4,Wild turkeys fly right through it,Spent 3 days surrounding my one acre property with this net. It stops deer. But dumb turkeys blast right through it. Had to dismantle the whole setup and replace it with welded wire fencing.
1,unsafe for wildlife,"I bought this netting to keep deer out of recently planted garden area. I put it up Saturday. On Sunday, I had small birds stuck in the netting. They were unable to get out, and their struggling caused them to become very entwined. Fortunately, I was able to cut them out of the netting. While it worked for the deer, I really do not want to harm other wildlife, which is why this product is only receiving one star. I took it down immediately and purchased wire fencing from Home Depot. It cost twice as much, but I am just not ok with wildlife being trapped in netting material for the sake of a few flowers. I really do not recommend using this."
4,Interesting Film,"I found this film very interesting and thought provoking. It is the perfect movie to watch on a dark raining night. Scary and it reminded me of a gothic tale of old. Loved the costumes.It is also a perfect movie for a ""movie"" club, to discuss."
5,To everyone who first saw this when it came out,"In almost forty years nobody's ever duplicated the power of this incredible movie. How is it possible that it took thirty-five years to get a print back out into the world? And wasn't it GREAT to see it again, and discover that it was even better than you remembered?There needs to be a third film in the set - The Innocents, The Haunting, and - what? Night of the Hunter?"
3,Well-done psychological thriller,"THE INNOCENTS, from 1961, and starring Deborah Kerr, is a well-directed, well-photographed and very well-acted psychological thriller based on Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"". It didn't really frighten me, but it's worth seeing for its production values."
4,Memorable,"I would have given it five stars if it wern't so short.The Island of Dr. Moreau is about a man named Prendick who , after his ship was distroyed, ended up one way or other on a small island. On this island is an exiled scientist from London, who does strange and cruel experements on animals. The strange animals here live in a peaceful civilization. In this civilization there are laws, and if these laws are ever broken 'none escape' the 'Master'(Dr. Moreau) and are sent to the 'house of pain'. One of the laws is not to eat flesh or fish, and when this law is broken by one of the Beast-Folk all hell brakes loose and Dr. Moreau's world, and Prendick's, falls crashing all around them."
5,The Best Documental of Incubus,"I like the way the band make this dvd into a ""documental"", one of the bestmusic dvd's of Incubus"
4,incubus; look alive,incubus's new dvd look alive is a good concert and clips of what they got to do while on tour. on some of the songs it goes back and forth from past shows of the same song recorded a few months ago. other than that its a great dvd for incubus fans.
5,Better INCUBUS,"Well...this is suppose to be my first review and I'll try to put my best on it, because this is a very good DVD. Nice filming and scenario with live footage filmed from different corner of world and places they've been. Last year I've seen them in concert and let me tell you that seeing this material makes me want to see more and more of them in a live show. This is a must have for every fan around the world..."
4,"Manager of the ""Honey Do"" list!","As the Manager of the critical ""Honey Do"" list that insures peace and tranquility for Life in the Castle, I need a great set of tools to get the job done. As my current tools have some age on them their performance is somewhat in question and that puts me in some peril. It has been a pleasure to launch project after project using such a reliahle and powerfull tool like the Factory-Reconditioned DeWalt DW958K-2R 18-Volt 3/8"" Cordless Compact Drill/Driver Kit. Even as a novice I have been able to bring light to the Knights, brace up items that were Dragon and rescue the Damsel before the castle was seized by Dis Repair. I owe my Kingdom and life of leisure to the increatible power of the Factory-Reconditioned DeWalt DW958K-2R 18-Volt 3/8"" Cordless Compact Drill/Driver Kit. With the magic of this tool I will live happily ever after. Thank you Merlin for favors granted!"
1,Sophmoric and tired attempts at humor,This reminds of the kind of skits one might see from a group of high schoolers trying to make some funny skits for an overnight camp show. The humor comes from watching your friends being silly -- not from the actual script itself which would be pretty lame. That is what watching this show was like. The jokes are poorly thought out and even more poorly acted. There is no sense of comic timing and the skits run impossibly long to the point where I kept skipping ahead to see if maybe the next skit would be funny.No such luck. It's a shame that I can't enter 0 stars.
4,A winner,"Of the films of Horrorfest 2007 I've seen so far, this is the best yet. This one had a good idea, with our hero getting killed in various violent ways and then waking up to travel to another death in some other life scenario. He's a college hockey player, then he works in an office and later he's a junkie and then.... Well, you get the point. Anyway, there is a force behind all theses happenings and it is a sinister force. This movie has violence, an original idea (at least for me it seemed original) and some really cool creatures that have one purpose...Scare people. Well, they do that but they find something more satisfying. I really enjoyed this one and have to put THE DEATHS OF IAN STONE as one I would easily recommend."
1,Not worth the hefty price tag!,"Do not buy, it's a nice wee dvd to have but the overal dvd is very short and the interviews come and go at the blink of an eye. If it were cheaper I would say go for it but at over $20 inc postage it does not come even close to being wortn it! Not much to learn from it either! DO NOT BUY!"
5,"""'Shine a Light' ages better than fine wine""","This is a great CD import single. First off the edit of the great song 'Shine a Light' (4:00), then comes 27 minutes of killer live music from an English concert at Shepards Bush Empire and 20 minutes of this is classic Led Zeppelin material with GREAT guitar and organ solos, which I feel even out does the old Led Zeppelin CDs. 31 minutes of music at slightly over the price of a normal CD--- Seek and Ye shall find Happy Memories !!!"
1,Disappointing,Loved the look and sound of the stethoscope. But it cracked within my first 12 hour shift so sent it back for refund
2,Prestige Stethoscope,"First of all this is great with patients. They just love the heart and color! Other then that its very hard to hear anything. I was not able to hear a NG placement and boy, was I mad. I'm a nursing student so the price was right at the time but its hard to hear any sounds, sometimes I can, sometimes I cant. Maybe I recieved a bad Prestige Stethoscope. Plus the shipping deal, the stethoscope, to my house took forever, I had to call and check the status of my order. It arrived but later then expected. Good luck!"
1,Heart not shatter resistant!!!,"Please, please do not waste your money on this item. It is cute, but the heart is not made of shatter resistant resin like it claims and will crack. I purchased one and Iam an RN and do not recommend it. Buy a regular stethoscope with nothing fancy!"
5,"Good deal, fast shipping.","Makes it faster and easier to recycle cans. Also with this product I can do everything one handed since it catches the cans after they are crushed. Just pop the next can in, and crush."
5,Start right,"This book covers a great range of variations and techniques and is a excellent starting point if you wish to do and understand marquetry. As a new member of our local marquetry group, i find having this book a great help."
4,Great Information for Those Interested in Healing With Color,"I found this book very enlightening. A must read for anyone who is interesed in holistic healing, especially with light and color. In the book Dr. Liberman tells of healing with a series of 20 colors. It would be great if he revealed in the book what these colors are. Missing is a ""how to"" section that would enable people to put his discoveries into practice."
5,"I laughed, I cried...","...From laughter, that is! WARNING: Do NOT read this book in a public place! I was reading it in my doctor's office, and drew many strange looks...it went something like this: <snicker>...<laugh>...<guffaw>. Lola's misadventures will ring true with anyone who's ever had anything to do with the cut-throat media world, yet will make one laugh uproariously while saying ""OMG, that's so true!"" Miss Harris, in her usual inimitable style, brilliantly sends up all of the business' buzzwords, hot properties, and trends. Run, don't walk, to buy this book!I hope to hear more from Miss Harris, as she's a true gem."
5,can't say enough about this gem!,"AaaaaAAAAaaaah!It's so GOOD!Holy HANNAH!I am making myself put Miss Media down to get work done, but I _love_ it!Okay, I only just started it last night, but already I think the tone is delicious, the wordplay sharp, the inner dialogue hilarious, and the invocation of impossibly acutely observed dotcom era tropes is making me dizzy!It's like watching a Harry Potter movie and seeing things from your brain come to Hollywood manufacture, in a good way. There's the image of Ovum I remember and maybe try to forget (having been there), then I smirk at the re-rendition 'for the screen' that is so right, but shinier somehow. Can't wait for my lunchbreak to read more!"
4,Why the hate?,"I've reviewed this movie everywhere else so I'll keep it short. If you liked John Carpenter's The Thing, you will like this movie...at least chances are good. This is Val Kilmer finally making a movie where he can play on his acting skills and not rely on action/combat skills (which he doesn't have many of). It's creepy, the setting is perfect and the way it ends makes it all worth it. At least worth a watch once, I loved this"
2,Not the worst movie ever...,"Okay, so this movie was pretty well produced... there are some pretty good scenes.. the cinematography is even pretty good in parts... but overall the acting stinks, and the plot requires the characters to make dozens of stupid decisions that no one would make. Its also a bit heavy handed on the whole ecology thing, which is not something I am even against... its just not done that well. Still, its the best thing Val Killmovie.. uh sorry.. Kilmer has done in a long time."
1,DISCONTINUED STALE PRODUCT,LOST APPROX $25.00 RETURNING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT ($40.00 OF MERCHANDISE) INCLUDING RESTOCKING FEE FOR PRODUCT WHICH COULD NOT BE RESTOCKED.RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS VENDOR.
2,Buy the Sony H5 instead,"I bought this camera because of the 18mm - 18x zoom after reading several reviews of the camera. I currently have the Sony H5, with a 35mm - 12x zoom. I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos of the Olympus and sent it back. I did a direct comparison of both cameras, taking identical shots. The Olympus produced soft images that bordered on blurry, with colors more muted than the Sony. The Sony has a 3"" LCD screen, which is much nicer than the Olympus 2.5"" screen. I thought there would be a big difference between the wide angle and zoom of the two cameras, but the poor picture quality wasn't worth the extra wide angle and zoom (which weren't that different from the Sony after all). Finally, Olympus cameras have a strange flash function- you must manually raise the flash if the flash is needed- it doesn't happen automatically as it does in most other large zoom cameras. If you don't remember to raise the flash, you end up missing the shot. Bottom line- buy the Sony."
5,Camera fits my needs,"I bought the camera for photographing sports events indoors, garden shots, and general family use. The camera works fine and the price was great for the quality.The negative is the instruction booklet is not easy to understand. I gave up and learned the camera by using it, rather than by reading the manual."
1,Rip Off,"I bought this camera 11 months ago. From time to time, I've had to turn it off and re-power it to get rid of error messages. About two weeks ago, I tried to use it and kept getting ""Zoom Error"" messages before it quickly shut itself off. I sent it to Olympus and they advised me the rim of the lens was scuffed, claiming I had dropped it and voided the warranty. They wanted $181.28 (almost 2/3 the original cost) to repair it! Number one, I did not drop it. I have no doubt the lens rim might be a little scuffed as I used it professionally and did not always keep it in a case. Number two, they didn't have the courtesy to call or email but sent it snail mail. The camera takes good pictures when it's working but if you are depending on Olympus making good the warranty, don't bother."
1,Faux no hitter,"To start the sixth, Carlos Beltran, in his first game at Citi Field since leaving the Mets last year, scorched a shot down the line. A replay showed Beltran hit the white chalk on the third-base line. Umpire Adrian Johnson ruled it a foul ball and Beltran ended up grounding out.""I saw the ball hitting outside the line, just foul,"" Johnson said to a pool reporter after the game.Johnson said he saw the replay, but upon further review, declined to comment if he thought the ball was fair or foul.So in reality it was a one hitter.The chalk clearly flew up in the air. Johnson blew the call. There's nothing bitter or hating when stating the facts except from rude New Yorkers."
3,Mayo set up,"This book was on my list from my instructor. While it seems a nice book, I have yet to use it."
3,color is not right,"I ordered a red one as it is on the picture, but got a pink one, even though the pink is still pretty."
5,Wonderful speakers,I replaced my stock Toyota speakers with these and it's a night and day difference. I wanted to keep the same size speaker also while on a budget. I was really happy to find polks in my price range.
1,Don't buy it!!,"A great film adaptation of a great Frank Loessermusical -- but in a wretched DVD transfer that Amazonshould be ashamed of itself for selling. I bought itbecause I love the show and was tired of lookingat the suboptimal VHS version, so I was staggeredto discover that the disk is simply a letterboxedSTANDARD-WIDTH transfer of the cassette.That's right: on a HDTV, you get only a small rectanglein the middle of the screen! For shame, Amazon!"
4,No Coffee Break,"Eliminating ""Coffee Break"" (and its choreography) was a huge disappointment within what I otherwise thought was quite good and peppy for a film version."
1,beyond sexist and corny,"this was without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever seen it was insulting to women and men alike and beyond dull. the attempt as a musical did not go unnoticed, however, and it was a horrible attempt. i must admit i didn't watch it all the way through as my time is way too valuable to waste on such bad work."
2,better choices are available...,"A few really good choices of classic examples are here, such as ""The Lucky Strike,"" but too many of these stories are either only vaguely altenate history or they lack the credibilty necessary for fiction based on conter-factual speculation. I recommend the collections Roads not Taken and the Way It Wasn't, both more to the point, and of course, the essay collections What If One and Two. And of course, great alternate history novels abound- why not start with Pavane, by Roberts and The Alteration, by Amis? Nothing in this collection ranks in the same category with them."
4,"Not all Alternate History, but still good","All around, this was a very good collection of short stories. Not all were especially memorable, and some were not even really alternate history: both of the stories ""The Death of Captain Future"" and ""All the Myriad Ways"" (which contains one of the best endings I have read) were excellent, but neither was alternate history. I could see how ""All the Myriad Ways"" made it into this collection, as it dealt with alternate worlds, but there were others which had no place in such an anthology. Don't get me wrong; most of the stories in this collection were enjoyable, some even unforgettable. There were a few poorly written, disappointing stories, but these were by far the minority. One warning: Many if not most of the stories have appeared in other places, so if you hve read many anthologies of alternate history, you may want to just get this title from the library."
3,Exceptional clarity,"If for no other reason than that this book on film avoids the academic jargon that blurs other theoritcal books, it is a pleasure to read. It is worth the price just for the relevant details that it presents, clearl land precisely. A very good standard film history."
5,The Parasite,"The Parasite is one of the best stories I have read by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that is not of the Sherlock Holmes variety. Professor Gilroy, who considers himself a realist, is pursuaded by one of his associates to see a clairvoyant mystic character in action; sort of a scientific experiment. It gets out of hand and the professor finds he has taken on more than he can handle. She has him under her spell and it quickly goes down hill. The story is told in such a wonderful way that you find yourself almost pleding with the main character to get hold of himself, to stop what he is doing and run away. Suspenseful; holds your interest from start to finish. And the ending may surprise you as well. 5 stars! I don't usually give that high a rating; this is a good one."
4,A close call,"At first seeming in danger of falling into my least favorite of Heyer's tropes--the older man with a beholden waif--Charity Girl avoids that fate for something much more satisfying. Henrietta doesn't get enough attention, but the ending is an enjoyable farce and, as usual, it all comes right in the end."
3,Rescue for Drudgery,"CHARIETY GIRL by Georgette Heyer is not an outstanding addition by the Queen of Regency, but it is a light fun read. Henrietta Silverdale is induced to provide shelter for Chariety Steane by her friend, Viscount Desford.Henrietta's interest in the young Viscount changes and the fun begins as he seeks a way to prevent a return to the life of an unpaid servant that is in store for Charity as her aunt's ward.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
3,So-so,"Because he kept racing from one town to another to try to fix the problems of a girl named Charity, there really wasn't much time spent between the hero, Ashley, and heroine, Henrietta. We are made to understand that Ashley and Henrietta have known each other all their lives and, after a whole lot of plot spent on resolving events concerning the rather insipid Charity and a series of other characters, we are to assume that Ashley and Henrietta are now in love. Just like that.Don't get me wrong, I loved both Ashley and Henrietta. Especially Henrietta as she is one of Heyer's older heroines (and I do love the older heroines). I just needed a little more time spent on developing a relationship between the main characters. Something, perhaps, akin to Bath Tangle."
2,Ineffective,"I had really high hopes for this product given the description and the reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me (and I started with the smallest dosage) and ended up upsetting my stomach even more! I stopped using it and the stomach troubles eased. May not be for everyone."
1,aweful on the stomach,I love love love Heathers peppermint capsules for my IBS. So i figured this is a fiber I can trust. WRONG! I only did the 1 dose of half a teaspoon. I couldn't even do the second one to get a full dose in for the day. I had cramping and nausea and felt ill so badly i couldn't stand straight. I thought well maybe it's just me. My fiance tried it who has no stomach issues and has no issue with fiber at all. In fact I swear his stomach is like a goat. He can endure anything well not this fiber. He took the same amount as me and had the same reaction. We both swore off this fiber and threw the whole can away. Waste of money for me and him. And he is the type that will eat something again that made him sick before. Sorry but I will never order this fiber again.
1,It had bugs in it,There were little bugs like old flour gets so I lost confidence and had to throw it away. I did open it upon receipt.
2,Not Usable on a Work Laptop,"Like all the other reviews here, I agree that the support material is calamitous. The pdf manual -- which is a disaster -- is not even bookmarked. Seems as if they couldn't be bothered. After some trial and error I have this working perfectly on a personal laptop but Tech Support told me it's unlikely to work on my company laptop -- I'm not able to change from a Domain to a Work Group. Maybe an FTP system will work for me -- if not, it's going back."
3,"Good, but there is much better","I used this guided for about 2 days, until i was able to get another one. address were wrong, information was out of date, and worst of all a bland approach to travel. check out lonely planet or even better Moon. Moon does a good job of helping to organize travel in a very readable format."
4,loved it,"im a huge Pokemon fan and this is a good deal for 10 dollars it may be on one disk but its good movies and i loved it shipping was decent and it wasn't scratched, id recommend it if you like Pokemon , i just wish they had the fist 4 for the same price xD"
4,A great bulk set,"This is a great set to get all these great 4 movies in one set. However the way they are given doesnt impress me all that much, they are all put onto one double sided disc with 2 movies either side. Also they are not displayed on the case in the correct order. It should go; 4ever, heroes, deoxys, jirachi. Other than those slight issues I was happy with this purchase. I would also like to see other sets out there like this one; pokemon 1-3, 8-11 etc..."
5,the 1930s version,"I like it just fine .but i'm looking for the 19 30s version if anyone knows were I can get it please let me know .....Thankyou,,,Ron"
3,Love it- wish I could learn to use it properly,"I am an Oblate of St. Benedict and purchased this Benedictine breviary to meet my needs for Daily Office. I too, like other reviewers, enjoy the size and the 'confort' it gives me. BUT I still have not fully learned to use it correctly and it is very frustrating. The instructions in the front have little help for me. I have searched out books that would help and I must interpret and wrangle the information and try to apply that information to this book. I have grown frustrated and reverted to my Glenstal Book of Prayer. I am again trying to figure out the BDP as it is where I would prefer to pray from. I wish Maxwell Johnson or Liturgical Press would put out some easily understood instructions for a novice like myself. I only rated it 3 stars because of my difficulty to understand and use it properly. The quality of the book is very good- HELP PLEASE"
4,A Great Love Tradgedy,"This book was touching and adventure filled. It was very touching to see how the Tristan & Isolde fouhgt for their love and had to part. But found ways to still keep their love. The adventures involved Tristan and his many battles to win glory and peace. I thought that the book was well written to the point where I found myself crying in the end with grief for the two lovers. But to not give any thing away i can not tell you why, read the book and find out!"
3,Not very much of a Christmas novel and only mildly entertaining mystery.,"An interesting concept but only marginally entertaining mystery whereby the lead detective is American Ben Franklin living as a boarder in London. He investigates the death of a pub-buddy and the fact that the man's daughter saw her father's ghostly appearance in her home the night before he actually died.Hall tries to make Franklin like Sherlock Holmes in this novel, however, a bad case of gout keeps him from physically doing anything so he must really on a young colleague named Nick (his Watson?).The Christmas season only provides back-drop and has no real significance on this decent mystery/historical fiction read."
5,Vain youth transformed into Doctor of the Church,"As a home educator, I read this book with the intention of screening it for my teen for a school assignment. In no time at all, I found myself unable to put the book down. I read it in just three nights - quite an accomplishment for a mother of five. Louis de Wohl presents the life of Augustine in novel form and makes it very interesting. The reader participates in Augustine's transformation from pagan to Christian. I can't wait to share it with my teen, I think that he will like it as much I did. (note: Before his conversion, Augustine and his friends speak very poorly of women. If sharing this book with a teen, use the opportunity to discuss Augustine's error in treating women as inferior, having a child out of wedlock, etc.) I am glad that there are books such as this one available that make learning history exciting."
4,Restless Flame,Inciteful read into the mind of a great Christian thinker and an early Church Father. His journey into the faith can help our own journeys. DeWohl makes this man accessible to everyone.
3,"Not bad, but not Farina's best either","I'm a true Mark Farina fan so believe me when I say that while this CD is good, it just never came together for me like I kept expecting it to. Some of the tracks really flow but the rest became a little tiresome and the mixing never became what Farina's known for. If you're new to Mark Farina or even a big fan and you want the true experience go with San Francisco Sessions, Mushroom Jazz (Volume II) or United DJ's of America Volume 9."
1,cheap,if you just looking for a cheap pair sunglasses then go to the dollar tree cause thats what these look like probally came from there if you want a good pair sunglasses go where they sell Foster Grants they are the best
5,Great place to shop,This is a great place to shop. Got exactly what I ordered and the item was shipped when they said it would be.Will use them again.Thanks.RD-Texas
1,This Book is too Easy,"This book took me about 10 seconds to read. When I finished, I thought I knew everything. Nope. I got a lousy 690 (about 10 points were becuase of this book and the other 680 because of my teacher). If thats what you want go for this book, if not get another one (still looking for a good one) Plus there are about 5000 mistakes"
2,Yawn.,"I tried really hard to like this event. The first two fights were fantastic but the rest simply blows. What the hell was up with the main event anyway?? I really love to watch Pride, but it bothers me when they throw scrubs at their cash cows like this. Putting a WWF style 'wrestler' in his MMA premier fight against Cro Cop is kind of like putting an amature boxer against Oscar DeLahoya for his first fight. It looks good on the highlight reels because it will end up the way it is supposed too... in a brutal KO. Lame."
4,"Nice mirror, decent lighting","So this is a nice looking mirror that is very sensitive to touch (ie: You will accidently turn it on or off often if you are not careful). The lighting itself is not super bright but it serves it's purpose. I used this mirror every day for about 2 years before the lighting stopped working. Just so you know, the light battery inside will die after about 2 years if not sooner."
4,Nice Mirror,"The lighting could be a little brighter, but it is a nice mirror with good magnification."
1,Get the FACTS,"This is the most poorly written book I have ever read! The ""facts"" he presents are grossly misrepresented. He really puts Oregonians in a bad light. Firstly,one of the Officers he names was fictional (or wrongly named). Secondly, They were only 5 miles from the accident, it did not take 28 minutes to respond. Thridly, the semi did not come to rest on the VW van that carried his family. I could continue to tear this book apart, but I will stop here. Next time Mr. Wharten wishes to write a true story, he should check his facts throughly first. I only read about 1/2 this book and put it down because it made me very upset. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
2,NOT thick,"I do NOT recommend. The towel is big in area, but very thin. Good towels are THICK, that's the main thing. These aren't! I was DISAPPOINTED."
5,Real quality,I love great towels. Hardly any of my towels match because I try different brands. These are by far the best. Wish I had found them sooner. I don't need any more I am just collecting now. The feel of them is wonderful. Thank goodness they are not more expensive. I think I would buy them anyway. There is nothing like quality.
3,Second try okay,"The first one I received was broken in the box, and the base even seemed to have been ""touched up"" after the finish was scraped. Maybe a return/attempt at refurbishing? Anyway, I called and quickly received a second, which looks fine. It's pretty tiny--I guess maybe I was too stingy buying the tiny one, bc it's a little hard to read. But it's attractive looking and works okay."
5,I love this thing!!!,"I have been reading the reviews on this product and decided to put my 2 cents worth in. I LOVE this product. I have had it since September. My only complaint is that the display is a little bright even on the lowest setting. The rest is fabulous.I was really amazed at the sound quality. Those little speakers are really good, and you can turn it up LOUD without distortion. I can't really comment on the reception, because I only listen to my ipod on it. I have never heard a hum on mine either and it sits about 12 inches from my head on my nightstand.I never have that OMG did I set the alarm feeling in the middle of the night, because it is always set. Not only that, but two different alarms are set.I have also never had a problem with the touchless snooze. I didn't buy this product on Amazon, and I paid quite a bit less for it, but even if I had paid more, I would still think it was worth it."
3,I can't get past my only gripe: display too bright,"I know, I know... there is a dimmer setting on the clock display. However, even at the low setting, my bedroom is lit up so brightly that I have to lean something up against it at night so I can sleep.Otherwise it works well."
1,A piece of junk,"Don't waste your time. I rarely write Amazon reviews, but potential buyers with older iPods need to be warned: It just does not work. Plus the radio reception is terrible and the sound quality miserable - with no way to correct the bassiness."
1,Don't - Don't - Don't,"I bought this item about six months ago. I thought it would fit the bill, boy was I wrong. First of all, you can never memorize the buttons, there are just to many and laid out terribly. I am constantly hitting the wrong button or need a light in order to see what I am hitting.Secondly and most unfortunelly, instead of charging my IPOD it drains it. Now this may be a malfunction, but I replaced my IPOD because it kept having issues, well it wasn't the IPOD it was this lousy radio.Don't - Don't - Don't buy this!"
2,inconsistent,after four months the power button on the top of the unit ceased working and the unit could not be turned on. Amazon sent a replacement even though it was after the 30 days .... the second unit remote sensor did not function... the third unit was received and set up and seems to be working - but it is only the first week... so although i thought it was a good value ... i have been disappointed by the quality of the actual physical product.
1,I've missed a lot of class due to this thing.,"I'm not sure if anyone else has been having this problem, but I set my alarm using their really cool weekday/weekend features, set my songs with my ipod, have my schedule all set up... then when it would turn the ipod on, it would play for half a second then put itself on snooze. I don't know if it has sometihng to do with the ""touchless snooze sensor"" or not but I have checked the manual over and over again with no help. Same thing happens when I turn on the radio. Customer service was less than helpful. I assume that every one that they put out doesnt have this problem, but if you have the chance, avoid this clock radio in case you get one in the batch that's alarm clock doesn't actually work."
1,product good company bad,"The product is good, but the company is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They keep insisting that i give them a 5 five star rating all the way across the board just because the service was average. They kept emailing me asking me to remove my rating and give them a positive rating! WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!!"
3,Emerson IPod radio,"This product is very good with sound quality and features for an I Pod radio, but it does not seem to want to allow the new IPhone GS2 to charge - very disappointing in that area. Otherwise I like the product. Only other issue I had was that faceplate falls off - it needs to be glued back on."
5,I love it!,"I got this cd for christmas. It was a present to myself. I want to get closer to Christ so I wanted to get some music that would speak to me which this does, I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Shoddy and Amateurish,"Anthony Holden's ""biography"", if you can call it that, of William Shakespeare is so unbelievably shoddy, that it is surprising that it has been published by a reputable house. It is also sloppy, speculative, and downright unnecessary. Holden engages in irresponsible conjectures, which he fobs off as truth, when there is in fact no evidence. He departs freely from fact, but doesn't have the decency to tell his reader when he is indulging in a flight of fancy. As Michiko Kakutani says in The New York Times, this book is best read not as a biography at all, but as a work of fiction.It is ironic that Anthony Holden has savagely attacked J.K. Rowling, the wondrously creative author of the Harry Potter series, when his own writing is so slipshod and amateurish. Perhaps his real objection is that she's a woman, from a middle-class background at that, not an Oxford don like C. S. Lewis. He only wishes he had Ms. Rowling's creativity and vision!"
1,Terrible,"I picked up this movie with the hope of seeing some action and suspense, but was instead subjected to a dark, murky movie with Demi Moore screaming at her kid, and the dark, lifeless face of Mr. Baldwin's character. Don't get me wrong. I respect and admire both Demi and Mr. Baldwin for their roles in other films, but this was not a good move on their part. I cleaned out some junk last weekend, and this movie went with it..Now I'm thinking I should have thrown it out, as I would not want to subject anyone else to this.."
1,A Non-Christian Gives Simplistic Advice To Christians,"Found this book used before the hype about Dr. Laura being a physiologist not a psychologist. Although the advice and benefits on Stay home mothers makes perfect since, who wouldn't want that option, the work force doesn't not make for a Family Friendly system-Wealthy or not. One has to question the authencity of a known hypocrite (see websites on the Dr. Laura in the Buff). I got a since of sour cynicism in the books tone and a diehard unforgiving conviction. I wouldn't recommend taking advice from someone taunting ""high"" morals while she herself doesn't practice what she ""preaches"". On a scale from one to 10. Hmmm. I give it a 1 do by it used to see for yourself if your still not convinced she unfit for the books title."
4,matchbox mega rig construction,"My 7 year old got this toy with his Christmas money. He already has the Squid sub and the Shark Adventure ship. He really likes those and so far has enjoyed the construction one as well. He complains that when the crane is made into a tower it isn't stable, top heavy. Having the other toys makes this one even more fun because the ship set came with claw that he adds to the crane instead of the wrecking ball and likes to build and move things with that. He has enjoyed it as much or more than lots of other toys he has had."
4,It's a memory card... with 512MB memory,Erm... Can't think of much to say here. I don't take videos using my camera so I don't know if the access time is good or bad but my brother has the same card in his camera and the videos he takes look fine.I've got photos on mine and it hasn't deleted any and it was cheaper than other 1/2 gig cards so you can't say fairer than that.
4,"Good price, quality product",Kingston products are generally as good as OEM parts but are much less expensive. I am satisfied with this purchase.
3,SHIPPING IS AS MUCH AS THE CARD,"Great card but you are better off buying it at the worst rip-off store in town. I thought I was sellecting Amazon as the Vendor but I was sent to one of the other vendors and spent $7.95 for this $11 item. This happened to me TWICE in one order. Unfortunately by the time you notice what has happened,Amazon has sent them your money."
4,Pretty soon they will be free,"Works properly -- purchased on price alone on the day I needed to buy it. What else is there to say? My old 64 MB Lexar is in the museum, having cost well over $100...."
1,Cheap product.,The eyegalsses look great in thte picture. But it is cheap and break easily. It is made from cheap plastic and not durable. Don't waste your money.
5,fantastic!,"At first I wasn't sure I wanted to read this book, because the synopses I read did not do it justice. Boy am I glad I gave it a try! This is one of the best fantasy books I have read in years, and I read a lot of fantasy! I especially liked the way Brian Jacques gives each kind of animal a separate and distinct culture, while weaving them all into the whole. This book is fast-paced and gripping, and never disappoints. Redwall fans should not pass it by. In fact, no-one who likes fantasy should pass it by. This book is more realistic, and at the same time, more fantastic, than most of the stuff on the market today. Once you have visited Redwall, you will want to return as often as you can!"
5,One of the better ones,Now this book only lacked a little bit of Martin's real warrior spirit but the book was great! Its one of the best in the series....mabye not in the top 3 but I'd put it in about 4th or 5th place. And finally an animal we hardly know anything about.....a stoat.....as a warlord.
5,The action packed prequel to Mossflower,"Martin the Warrior is the first book chronologically in the Redwall series. It opens with Martin as a slave to an evil Stoat Warlord named Badrang. Martin, while chained to a stake in a storm vows to kill Badrang. After Martin escapes he has many adventures with his friends Rose (a mouse), Grumm (a mole), and Pallum (a hedgehog and my personal favorite). Together they have many adventures, encounters with many bizare animals, and hardships. This book is saved from mediocrity by it's colorful characters, furios battles, and humerous moments. It is a worthy prequel to Mossflower and a great addition to the Redwall series, but it is still not my favorite (see my review of Mossflower)"
4,The best book of the Redwall saga I have yet read,"I'm soo glad Brian Jacques wrote the story of Martin. This heroic tale is the fabrick of dreames. The author did a wonderfull job writting it so eliquintly. A impossible book to put down, I was near to getting a detention for reading it in class. Martin the warrior's tale is sure to remain on my list of all-time favorites. I highly recomend it to all ages!"
4,"Great actors that can sing, and Grace Kelly?","Now there is a combination worthy of four stars! This was on PBS last night, and seeing as it had three movies stars that I like, I couldn't resist it!I am a long time fan of the movie musical, and I particularly enjoyed this one. It has Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, and Grace Kelly in it. Sinatra and Crosby do most of the crooning, but Kelly also sings a little bit. She can really sing too! What an amazing star! She could act, look so elegant and graceful, and sing!Usually the music takes top shelf over the acting, but I quite enjoyed both in this musical remake of ""The Philadelphia Story"".If you liked ""The Philadelphia Story"", and you like musicals. You will probably like this movie a lot.It is a fun movie with two hip crooners as it's stars.Two thumbs up! Way up!"
3,High Society-not a fan of Musicals but..,"There is no Denying High Society is a classy movie and a different breed from Hollywood's Golden Era.The best part is Louis Armstrong's scating,The Cinematography is great and you can sense it was a different time and era and much safer more classy time without any of the trends that sadly permeate our culture today.I am just not a Musical Guy but I did enjoy the film."
4,Crosby and Sinatra hit it off!!,"This film is packed with comedy and great music. The story line is so funny and the actors portray their characters perfectly. Crosby plays a divorced man who lives next door to his ex-wife who is soon to be married and who he is still very much in love with. But with some help from a reported who is covering the wedding, played by Sinatra, the story takes a twist.This movie is a lot of fun!!"
3,Blockbuster on a budget?,"What I don't like about this production is it's chintziness - I doubt any of it was filmed on location at Newport, Rhode Island. This is supposed to be film about high society but the only flavor we get of high society is the interior sets probably constructed in a film studio in Hollywood."
5,Simple yet powerful,"If you are interested in developing and utilizing your innate healing abilities, then Quantum Touch by Richard Gordon is for you. This book is well written and very easy to follow. The techniques described in this book emphasizes on the importance of proper breathing and the principle of entrainment. According to this principle, if two items are vibrating side by side at different frequencies, then the lower frequency item which in this case is the patient will be adjusted itself to the higher healing frequency of the healer. Quantum Touch healing techniques are very simple yet powerful!Naked Spirit: The Supernatural Odyssey"
3,Disappointed,"The only good track is the title track ""Escape"" and this track is simply a gem. But the entire rest of the CD seems to contain nothing but filler songs. A huge disappointment. I thought it would have more songs like ""Escape"" in it but it turns out that none of the other songs are even remotely like it. While commuting I just listen to Escape a few times and then switch to some other CD."
2,He's no Julio,"Why hasn't anyone noticed the boy can't sing! Granted the kid is cute, but without that he'd be nowhere. He also needs to get over himself. There are so many other young latin singers that are far better than he, but don't have the looks OR the name Iglesias."
3,received wrong cd,"I ordered his Escape cd, instead I received the cd that is named after him. Also the case was badly damaged. I would have ordered this cd evenually, but I really wanted the other one."
5,Scrumptious and highly entertaining!,"I read this book on the airplane and didn't want to put it down. Goldy is always trying to figure out the latest crime, and ends up putting herself in danger. This is my second Diane Mott Davidson book and I am officially addicted.Money can't buy love was repeated in this book and it couldn't be truer. One person after another dies, and Goldy is all caught up in it, but it isn't clear at all who is the true killer. Could it be Authur who killed his mother and wants to get her will changed to receive all her money? Could it be Barton Reed? There are a few that it could be. You will have to read and find out. But I agree, don't read this book on an empty stomach or you will be cooking up the first one! Enjoy!"
4,Re. previous criticism...,"I have already weighed in (pardon the pun, Goldie) re. the ""corpulent caterer"" as the main character is referred to in a news article in ""Tough Cookie,"" but felt I must clear up a reviewer's previous criticism.Goldie's husband Tom fixed her drain. He took the whole thing apart and put it back together for her, good as new, so they wouldn't have to hire a plumber to do the work. Don't people read the book before they make a negative comment? Seems irresponsible to me."
2,Wrong album art misled me...,"Initially I was impressed as I received this product surprisingly fast which made getting it that much more anticlimactic. Once I opened the package I realized that I was sent the wrong CD... or so I thought. I thought I ordered the Special Edition version of the album because that was the graphic used for the Original version that was sent to me. I suppose I am partially at fault for overlooking the fact the the text description lacked the ""special edition"" in parenthesis. But I was disappointed as the seller did not respond to my inquiry. So, now I just have a extra copy of a CD that I already have to re-gift... at least it was bought at a good price."
5,i don't see how this could be a disappointment...,Emery is great. I think they're musically better than the first cd...I don't know if they are lyrically better but it's not a disappointment. I also don't see any similarities between Emery and Thursday. Actually I can't think of any band that sounds like Emery at all so if you like Emery get this cd!
4,Well-done emo,"Normally, one should beware of bands that dress in matching outfits. But strip away the group shopping trips and oh-so-hip indie neckties, and Emery is a band that does emo on par with anything else out there. Some cuts lean towards screamo, while others are practically straight-up pop with creative instrumentation and flawless vocal harmonies. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but if you want state-of-the-art emo with tight songwriting and clear production, you'd do well with Emery."
4,Good CD,"Let me tell you, I was unsure of this band. They're a little less heavy then I'm used to. The first CD is a lot different, but this one is good too! This album is not as heavy but it's better arranged. The songs are definitley catchy and it's a great CD to listen to."
1,A book with no emphasis,"Any other textbook titled ""biochemistry"" is well enough to replace this book and to reach a greater depth and to facilitate a better understanding of the readers than this one does."
5,autry rides again,"any time you can get a leading cowboy, good clean hummor, and gun fights all in one show, you hit the jack-pot. pass movies like these on to the next generation and mabey things will get better for everyone."
3,Gene Autry Collection 1,"In this 2-disc set we thoroughly enjoyed the first disc. The 2 movies melody Trail & The Big Show are delightful. But, the second disc was a dissappointment as ,only one of the movies played. Boots & Saddles played beautifully & is a good movie , but we couldn't play Rhythm of the Saddle. It just kept flicking back to Boots & Saddles, I am wondering if this was a fault with all copies of this disc, or did we get a lemon.? It is too expensive to send the disc back , but, I would like to know if this is a one-off fault or does it apply to all those discs. We would really like to get a copy of Rythm of the Saddle, but are afraid to risk buying it again."
1,Less is not always more,Definitely not recommended.Main problem: It's simply too slow to be of any use - the delay betwen pressing the shutter button and the camera actually taking the shot makes this camera next to useless. We took this to Six Flags and I took shots of the dolphin show which were useless as the camera cannot operate fast enough even in bright sunlight. I have replaced this with a Fuji z5 which is better in every respect.(..and don't get me started on the pointlessness of 'feature' that allows you to shoot movies without sound...)
2,No sound on video!,This camera is fine if you want to just take pictures. Very nice pictures.Two problems.1. No rechargeable battery. I bought some rechargeable AA batteries and that has worked OK.2. This is a BIG problem. The video has NO SOUND. What's the point of shooting video without sound? Just terrible.I would not recommend this camera.
1,Not Worth the Money,"This camera, while inexpensive is not worth buying, here's why. Basically, having owned several digicams before, this camera is slow. Aperture is not large enough and the flash blows out peoples faces. IF you need a camera for taking still shots outside, I guess this will be OK"
1,Don't buy this camera,"This camera has a ""battery empty"" problem. It doesn't matter how many new batteries you buy, it will continue giving the same message. I bought the camera because of the brand, but this is the last Olympus camera I will ever buy."
1,Cantankerous little toy,"Unless you have brand new Duracell or Energizer batteries in there, it will likely say ""Empty Battery"" and shut down. Since rechargeable batteries have slightly lower voltage, you will not get very far with it, or be continually charging batteries. Testing out the batteries with a tester and have the dial rate them Good and/or green is not good enough for this little pest. It may be a defective sensor, but I have a feeling this new camera will be in a landfill before the week is out.Back to 35mm. It have served me well for 25 years."
1,Bad Quality,"I'm not talking about the contents, because I just bought the book and I started reading it now.For my surprise in the first 3 days using the book the pages started to fell over, and I already loose pages from the contents and chapter one.I wonder if there will any left by the time I finish the book."
4,Good shine spray,"This spray gives a great shine, be carful that you don't spray to much or it will make your hair look greasy, a quick spray all over is all you need and it gives a great shine all day. Nice smell to..."
2,EVO or what?,"HOLD THE PHONE!It's a very fine mist of oil on your hair - slick, greasy, and shiny.It does make your hair shine, but if you gray hairs, guess what... those are the ones that pickup the most shine!Yes, this is a wonderful GRAY HAIR SHINE. Not so good on your dyed hair!? (soaked in, I guess).I really felt more like spraying olive oil or PAM.Love the CHI hair straightener, but not so much on the red can stuff (I bought 5 different products and they are expensive, without remarkable results)"
1,Full Can That Is CLOGGED,"It's a spendy product for one usage - mine clogged after using it ONCE. I've rinsed the tip, the cap's spout and underside after popping it off, hot water, cold water, warm... doesn't unclog. WHAT A WASTE!!!"
1,CHI Shine Infusion Spray,Ordered this product in February 2010...still waiting to receive it. There was no tracking information available even though I received a link via email. Still waiting...
4,Great read !,"When I purchased ""ONS"" I sat down with it that day and didn't put it down till page 80! Devoured the rest the following morning!!I would've liked the book to be longer. Purely for selfish reasons of course, as I didn't want it to end so quickly. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in ages.I loved the honesty and humanity (good & bad & all the rest!) of it. It transported me to Leeds, the era, the atmosphere in a wonderful way that made me feel I was right in it.Look forward to reading the sequel!"
4,"""Repair"" is really ""Replace""","The authors offer a nice description of the main components within a PC, and how these fit together to give you a working machine. Necessarily, they use technical jargon. But the level of discussion does not assume any previous technical background on your part.Also, several chapters are devoted to the vital subject of how to hook your PC into a network, via wired or wireless means. In either case, hubs and switches are explained. While these are not part of a PC, nowadays, a lot of the value of a PC is when it is connected to the Internet.Note that ""Repair"" in the title is really a misnomer. An important point made by the authors. If a part of a PC breaks, it is rarely repaired. The complexity is often beyond most customer's ability to do so, or that of a local computer shop, for that matter. Plus, the low price of the part often does not make it economic anyway."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"This is a truly unique deranged movie about a couple of simple-minded young women trying to make sense of their lives. It's an odd mix of poignance and ridiculousness involving a lot of crazy intentional overacting. The emotional turmoil is serious, but the vocal inflection is consistently ridiculous. It reminds me of Beetlejuice, Evil Dead, The Nature Of The Beast, Roadracers, Crybaby, and The Road To Wellville. Those movies all have a similarly off-kilter blend of seriousness and insanity that defies even the conventions of being unconventional."
1,This boombox doesn't work!,I can't get it to work - this is the last time I buy a partially used electronic device off of the internet.
4,Great Plug 'n' Play Boombox,"This is a great product for the price. I have used it for over three weeks now without any problems. It would be even better, if there was a control to regulate the bass. The cord storage area for the indoor/outdoor antenna is adequate but not the best. All in all this product earns between a 7 and 8 out of a possible ten."
4,it's not bad for her first go at singing,"billie's first go at singing is not to bad. She sings quite well but girlfriend (her 2nd single) is much better and the remix of it on c.d 1 track 3, my fav it remix of all of them. I my fav song my her is I Dream on the album."
4,"The right size, feels a little cheap","... but then it is cheap. The key feels a little clunky and cheap in the lock, but it works.The lock is just the right size for locking most of the time. Search the web for Sheldon Brown's (a biking oracle) locking strategy page if you think you need something bigger.Cable is plenty long enough to be looped around the front wheel, strung through the saddle and down to the lock on the rear wheel."
1,Cable only looks secure,"11/28/08 - Buyer Beware: I had two bicycles stolen (over $1400 value) from my garage when a thief cut through a related productOnGuard Akita 5080 Bicycle Security Cable (Lock Not Included)in one slice. Looks like they used a chain cutter. Unless you're using this as a theft deterrent or for low value items, don't fool yourself that you're buying security."
5,very pleased,"So I ordered a bike lock but it wasn't what I thought, so I returned it. The company was wonderful about my return--a totally painless process. Everything was smooth as a baby's bottom."
5,Recommended by a lot of bike stores,Good heavy mini lock. The key is nothing like the typical pickable locks. it seems to be pickable. It seems the only way to break the lock would be to cut t The added cable is great and they give you 5 keys for the lock in case you lose 4 of them. My bike hasn't been stolen yet!
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this about a year and a half ago. The lock itself is fine, probably not big differences in security between this and other brands. But what really has disappointed me is that the keys are very flimsy (are the made of aluminum?), and if the lock is ""sticky"", as it is in the winter, it's pretty easy to just twist the key without turning the lock. I'm going to buy a different brand next time."
3,The keys are kind of ridiculous,"The lock itself? Great.The frame mount? Not perfect but not aweful.The keys? Ridiculous. I say that because there are several people right here on Amazon that profess to the keys being fragile. Then the documentation that came with the lock had all these scary warnings, like ""BE CAREFUL WITH THE KEY"", etc.So I wonder.... why on earth make the keys out of mostly plastic? Making them out of metal would solve so many problems. Also the manufacturer probably wouldn't need to include FIVE spare keys, thus saving costs or at least offsetting the cost of all-metal keys.And yes, you do need to be very careful with the keys --feels like they will break with a gust of wind."
4,"Great toy, but makes noise","This is a fun toy for our toddlers to pull around the house. We also have the snail version which I like better because it is quieter. This one clanks together when it is pulled, which is cool, but it echos off of our hardwood floor and is louder than I'd prefer with a newborn nearby."
3,"Loud, not great on hardwood","This alligator is cute and my daughter quite likes it, but as we have wood floors throughout most of our house, he's been banished to the attic. The clatter noise is loud but fine, but my problem is that the wood pieces forming the middle of the body really drag on the wood floor as he's pulled along. If those were a bit shorter so it wouldn't drag on the floor, I'd be much happier with this toy."
3,FYI- super loud!,My son occasionally drags this guy through the house. Adorable - but the clacking is very very loud... Though I like that it is not plastic!
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this as a gift and I was sorely disappointed when I opened the envelope: it reminds me of a pen from the doctor's office as University Store on it with their phone number, etc. It is not purple nor is it clear and keep in mind that it is a bit larger than the picture and that there is advertising on it. I cannot speak to how it works but it's not worth it for a gift at least..."
4,"I missed the class, but this was good","I was unableto take a forearm massage class that was held here recently. In order to exchange with another therapist, I needed something to study. This dvd was a good introduction and way to study. Really useful. would like to see more moves in an advanced edition."
3,Lars Von Triers Owes Plenty to Ken Russell,"Forget this, grab a copy of Ken Russell's superlative ""The Devils"" and see what real film making is really like."
5,"Amazing movie, but prepare to be sad","This movie is DARK. Do not buy it (or even watch it) if you don't like dark, depressing films. If you can get past that and see it for the beautifully made, amazingly acted film that it is, check it out. Obviously, since its a Criterion Blu ray, the quality is outstanding."
4,A battle between the Apollonian and Dionysian principles,"The negative reviews are fascinating. Some people seemed to be expecting a traditional horror genre movie and were confused and disappointed. One person was expecting a porn movie, and was very disappointed.The other category of criticism came from those who found the film ""pretentious, boring, and dumb.""Although the film does not supply any easy answers, in order to get meaning from it I think the film requires a certain amount of knowledge about a variety of subjects, including mythology, feminism, psychology, and European religious history. I find it to be both a very disturbing and powerful film. At times beautiful, and others gruesome. A battle between the Apollonian and Dionysian principles. Mysterious and provocative."
3,Brave and interesting,"I thought this was a very brave and interesting movie - twisted, yet intriguing in a perverse kind of way!"
4,Ten Years After Undead,"Great album..a nugget from the 60's british blues boom...great recording for a live show..I originally had this on vinyl in the 60's..I was really knocked out by the jazzier cuts as well..Great band with amazing chops..CD version added more great tracks.this was I believe, TYA's 2nd outing..who went on to put out a slew of great blues rock albums"
5,Chances Are,"This is the single for Soak Up The Sun by Sheryl Crow, the lead single from her 2002 album C'MON C'MON. The song is an infectuous summer song that will have you humming and tapping along to the song. It comes in the radio edit version and the album version. The real reason to purchase the single is for the b-sides. ""You're Not The One"" is a haunting song Sheryl did with Stevie Nicks, but the true gem is ""Chances Are"". This should have been on the album. It's a ballad type song with haunting vocals and interesting lyrics. A must have for the Sheryl Crow fan."
2,Mathmatical analyses,This book is almost pure mathmatics. It has very limited amount of general analyses of application unless you are a mathmatician.
2,Barely readable,"I gave this book only two stars because I actually felt compeled to read to the end. I should have known; any book that opens with a beheading, and the victims heads being placed in the washer and dryer, is bound to be disgusting. I guess I just had no idea how disgusting. I'm not generally a squeamish person, but this was just over the top. Not to mention the plot was thin; you know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and the eventual revelation was no big surprise. I personally found Martin's writing to be overdone; his descriptions had the subtlety of a 2 by 4, and some were just plain bad. The run on sentences and lack of commas just beg for a good editor. If you are looking for some good psychological suspense, just get a Stephen King or an Iris Johansen novel; those are actually scary and mysterious, not just gross."
3,Any books on NY Hartford & New Haven line?,curious about the short lived rail line from bronx through present day #5 elevated subway line tracks? NY Rangers used to practice at their old repair barn. It has since become and NYC bus service building.
1,Jessie Pen-Lewis would flip in her grave,"After reading the original manuscript of the 1912 version of War on the Saints, I was suprised at the vast amount of changes in this version of the book as well as the ""unabridged"" version as well! Whitaker House, the publisher, has deleated many of Penn-Lewis' Biblical teachings on Christians and demonization. It is well documented that Christians tody CAN be deminically influenced. It is a shame that Whitaker House has republished this work claiming it to be authentic. To get the full message of what Jessie Penn-Lewis was getting at, you'll have to find a used copy. It will be well worth your time. War on the Saints is the most powerful book in the history Christian literature!"
5,Nick Warren is the Man,"Ex Cream resident Nick Warren comes back with a stunning performance based on his set at Sao Paulo.This cd is stunning and beautiful at the same time. The first cd starts off dark and ends with a uplifting beat. Based on the performance of his first cd i would have to give Nick Warren alot of credit for skills as a dj. The second disc has a building up peak and climax, the second side is awesome mixing together some beautiful tracks that i never heard b4 (which is the whole point of the GU series) and listening to some familiars (Cafe Del Mar, Breath in you) Nick warren is a excellent dj, i would even have to say even bolder than his movement 98 partner Oakenfold. These two cd's are excellent and show me a side of trance that i have never seen b4 adding with it alittle bit of progressive house."
4,Disappointed in delivery date.,The CD was a gift. I have nothing against the product itself. I thought that it took too much time before I got it. It wasn't received until after Christmas when ordered on 12/10/09. It wasn't postmarked until 12/22/09.
1,lousy,"innaccurate, slow to measure, and the metronome subdivisions are actually wrong.this is NOT worth buying. There are better products available in the same price range."
5,"Ejoyable yes, artistic.. also yes.","Kind of in response to the highly understandable review above, I'd like to state that this book is in fact enjoyable, and not as much of a drag as the other reader makes it sound like. It is however very eloquent and artistic, and should therefore not be read purely for the enjoyment of the story, but also for the language used. The language itself is part of the story, and thats why it would be good for you to buy this critical edition. It will explain exactly how this is so, and will probably lead you to understand and appreciate the book much better. So even though the reader above is not wrong, I think it is a highly superficial argument, and I urge all of you people interested enough in prose and literature to buy this book nevertheless."
5,The Ambassadors,"This is surely one of the great works of literature. The style may seem at times slow going, but it rewards the patient reader with its rich, sensitive portrayal of characters and the varied effects of the old world charm of Paris on New England visitors. It is suspenseful thoughtful and brilliant in its depiction of social interactions."
3,Wrong cover,"The book arrived in good condition, but it didn't have the beautiful red embossed hardcover that the website shows."
3,"A Disappointment, unfortunately the last of the series","This book,while a good character study, is extremely darker than the other books in the series. Olivier, a very strong character in ""Virgin in the Ice"", seems to be much weaker here. Also, I wish there had been more of a mystery. There is a death, but Peters focuses more on the father-son relationship. Overall, the book left me feeling unsatisfied and wishing that the author had another ""Cadfael"" in the works. Unfortunately, there is not."
3,Left me longing for more,"I was disappointed with this book. I am a big Ellis Peters fan and I hate that this is her final book. I was delighted at the reappearance of the character of Olivier de Bretagne; he was always one of my favorites. However, this book has a much darker tone than the earlier ones, and left me wishing for one more ""Brother Cadfael"", one a little more light-hearted."
5,Brought a tear to my eye...great for all ages!,"I loved this book...I am considering adopting a child and found this book really heartwarming...I bought a copy for my nieces because I think it's good to expose them to the idea that there are all kinds of families in the world, and adoption, single mothers, and interracial families are all gently discussed.My seven year old niece was able to read the book to her 4 year old sister, and both of them loved the story! The younger one was really excited about the pictures and Annie is her favorite movie, so this was a natural. The elder has a Chinese adoptee in her class this year, so this book addressed some really germain topics.Someday maybe I can read this book to MY daughter!"
5,A Superb Overview of How We've Messed Up the Environment,"I know of no better book about the environmental crises in the US today than this one. It is full of ideas and information but is also full of feeling and is a great read! The book also tells the often sad and outrageous story of environmental politics from the conservative ""revolution"" to the present and explores many of the very bizarre ways in which we Americans have attempted culturally to adapt to living with and in environmental crisis. I highly recommmend it.Diane Dudzinski"
3,Calcium Citrate+vitamin D,"I originally bought these vitamins for my 3 year old son. I wish you would have mentioned that they do not taste good. They taste like chalk and he will not eat them. So, I am stuck with eating them, by swallowing them."
1,If it were possible to give zero stars I would have,"Beware!!! I bought the white and the green one for my eight year old son. With in two days the little paddle, for lack of a better thing to call it, on the white one broke. Very, very upsetting for a kid!!! He honestly used it maybe a total of an hour and as he was playing it just snapped off. Poor craftsmanship or a fluke you decide!"
5,Dance Music From Old Vienna,"Just great! I had attended schule (school) in Wien (Vienna) and it reminded me of when we could sit in the Weinstube and listen to the local orchestra...and drink, of course! LOVE Lanner!"
4,Defines and highlights the effects of emotional labor.,"Using the experiences of flight attendants, the author describes the stresses and effects of on-the-job ""emotional labor"". She also describes how dehumanizing such labor can be in an atmosphere of gender inequality, socioeconomic inequality, and the increasing rationalization of the workplace in the corporate pursuit of profits. An excellent and interesting read."
1,short life expectancy,"This heater worked fine at first, and I did use it for several months. After spending Spring and Summer tucked away in a closet, it failed on the first cool day this fall that I attempted to use it. The heater now shuts off as soon as it gets hot - less than 5 minutes - and goes into reset mode - cannot be started again till it cools down. It will start again after it cools, but again will shut down automatically after about a minute. It's pretty much worthless now."
4,I love it except the increased electric bill,This heater is very quiet and works really well. It has high and low settings in addition to various temperature settings with thermostat. It has a nice safety feature of getting shut off when tipped over. It is very light and portable that you can easily move it to one location to another. A buyer be aware that it consumes a lot of electricity.
2,What a mess,"I am on my fourth attempt to install (really upgrade from 2003) the Norton Firewall that was bundled with the Internet Security. It has been a disaster. Everything works if I disable the Firewall, but isn't that a problem? Their web site has plenty of articles on troubleshooting the product, though none have solved the problem. I am tempted to call for support, but I am not interested in paying Norton more money for a product I have already paid for. I am tempted to follow some of the other reviewer's lead and pick another product."
4,No Problems,"Possibly because I am using this on a brand new computer with xp. I have experienced no system delays,conflicts with any other software, and very few of the pop-ups that every one else is complaining about. I've had much worse than this, like Zone-Alarm."
1,A nightmare!,"If you have Windows XP, avoid this program at all costs. I can't believe I dropped $50 for hours upon hours of agony. It will compromise your system beyond all hope. I ended up having to do a full system recovery before my laptop was back to normal. And, don't even bother w/ calling Norton for help. You'll just end up even angrier. Buy something else, ANYTHING else. Just avoid this product, you'll thank me later."
1,Don't buy this software - I did and I regret it.,"I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt. Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow. Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible. Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.It came bundled with Norton Anti-Virus which I found pretty good. However, I ultimately decided to remove the firewall because it was just so crappy. Unfortunately there was no way to leave Norton AntiVirus installed, so in the end I had to throw the whole thing away. I tried to use their techincal support to get things worked out, but that was a whole other nightmare. They really, really don't want to support people, and they make you jump through all kinds of crazy hoops.I've owned about 10 home computers, and been using computers since 1989, and I've never been more disappointed in any software investment."
1,This product is crap,My computer is VERY slow after installing. It crashes Outlook Express. Can't install products individually.
1,STUPID STUPID STUPID,i hate this. i wanted to play an internet game that was not even funny and it blocked it for comody. i hope the place that made this burns down. I HATE THIS IT MAKES THE INTERNET BORING. if i could give it -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 STARS. its also embarissing. TAKE THAT NORTON (...)
1,Rebuttal of Norton support agent,"After reading the review of the Norton support agent, I felt that I needed to expand my review. I work in an operations lab for a Fortune 500 Co. We spend millions of $ for NAV. In addition, I have installed Symantec products on every server in my lab over the last 3 years. Hence, I felt comfortable purchasing a Symantec product. NIS 2004 is a flawed software. Some isp's help consumers by blocking communication on various unused or unusual ports. NIS uses an unusual port for activation. My personal computer runs an ad/spyware scanner & a registry cleaner on a weekly basis. Until recently, I've used older versions of NAV to keep my machine free of viruses. I run Ethereal network protocol analyzer every month, because checking the activity of various network protocols floats my boat. With all my experience, I was unable to activate my product. What chance does a normal user have of using this product? Cost is immaterial. Buy something from Amazon that works."
1,Activation Problems,"I was unable to activate the 2004 version of NIS at home. If your broadband ISP (in my case, comcast) uses any type of firewall (ie. for packet filtering and/or port monitoring), please save yourself at least a weeks worth of troubleshooting. Currently, the only way I can activate this product is by phone. My last three computers have not had modems and my cell phone acts as my only phone connection. In addition, Symantec only provides ""award-winning support"" if you pay $30 a pop for live support. This is a documented problem. http://service.symantec.com/pcfix"
2,"Effective, but VERY bulky","While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system. I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.The Antivirus is good, but ""Internet Security"" just isn't worth it."
1,Slowed my machine way down,"I have a PIII-850MHz machine running Win/ME. This program drastically slowed my machine down, to the point that I uninstalled it. If you need a firewall, use ZoneAlarm. It's free."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"Do not buy NIS 2004. I recently built a new computer, so I decided to put the latest and greatest internet protection on it. Even with a brand new installation of Windows XP I could not get NIS 2004 to install properly. After 5 days of working on this problem I still can't get the anti-virus autoprotect to run. I've completely erased my hard drive reinstalled everything including NIS 2004, all according to Symantec ""experts"" still I get the error message ""Norton AntiVirus has encountered an internal program error""(4002,517)or (4002,519). This is insane. I will demand a refund on this product!!! I repeat ""Do Not Buy""."
1,BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS! DON'T BUY THIS !!!,"I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember. Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.That said, the latest release (Norton Internet Security 2004) is the WORST SOFTWARE I HAVE EVER USED. Worse, Symantec basically FORCED me to convert from NIS 2002 (which I was delighted with) to NIS 2004 in early January (See the review by Roperwin dated 1-24-04 for details. What happened to him happened to me).Rather than repeating what has already been said, I'll just recommend that you keep reading the reviews here and on CNET.com and BELIEVE THEM.It will take me days to get my computer back to normal after uninstalling NIS 2004. This is one of the worst software experiences I have ever had in 24 years of personal computer use."
2,Very Poor Documentation and Install Problems Galore,"I have used and loved Norton Anti-Virus for years. I started using Internet Security in 2002 and 2003 and was very pleased with the product. Well the upgrade to 2004 did not go well. I ended up removing the old and new and reinstalled from scratch. I still had configuration problems and after five hours of tracking down possibilites I gave up for a few days! The User's Guide was not much help and it didn't match the on-line help. There are mismatches between the screen titles, options, labels and anything else you want to compare! It wasn't until 2 days later that I decided to try and fix things, such as intermittent access to the internet and lock ups durring live update. Once I went to symantic support and downloaded all of their patches...took about an hour to download reboot download reboot download...things finally started working! If you don't have high speed internet this is not for you! I cannot recommend this product in it's present state!"
2,Abnormal program termination...,"After installing this software on a brand new CPU, we began seeing this runtime error every time MS Outlook was started. Researching the Internet revealed that this has been an issue since early 2003, regardless of how ""clean"" or fast ones computer is. The primary association with the error has been Norton Anti-Spam or Internet Security and MS Outlook 2000, 2002, or 2003. We should all accept by now that computers are complex, and software is often released prematurely, with multiple service releases to fix bugs as they are discovered. I do have a problem however, with the attitude of the Norton Support Technician, or those in support at any other software company. Why should we consumers have to wait two years for obvious conflicts to be resolved? We spent good money on this product, and although it works OK with our faster computer, we're annoyed by the conflict with Outlook and expect to see a patch that will fix it."
1,"A trusted name, but garbageware","On Windows XP, after a couple of months, got a notice that the antivirus portion nmeeded to be reinstalled. Reinstall failed numerous times. After much digging on Symantec's support web site, found out that ALL Symantec products needed to be totally uninstalled first(including deleting registry keys), before reinstalling. OK - this is involved but doable, I'm mildly annoyed. 7 hours later, after following the confusing instructions, it FAILED again. And oh by the way - THEY WANT $30 FOR PHONE SUPPORT. Like they'll get another PENNY of my money after this experience. Never another Symantec product for me."
1,"Avoid this ""upgrade""","I usually never write any reviews but this time I had to do it! NIS 2004 is the biggest piece of crap that I ever used and I am very disapointed at Norton. I have been using their products for many years and was quite happy with that. However after spending my money on 2004 I decided that I won't buy any of their products again. What happened to the quality stuff that they used come out with?NIS 2004 simply doesn't work. I have quite a powerful laptop and this software takes away too many resources, crashes very often and is very intrusive.Another thing that anoyed me is that it refuses to work with Gaim 0.76 even if I say that I allow the software to connect to the net in all ports.I wanted to get rid of the firewall and keep using the antivirus but even that is not possible. It tries to force me to use the whole package. I am going back to NIS 2003 while I don't find a good substitute.This is complete crap and I completly chaged the image I had of this company."
1,Anything more then 1 star is to much.,"I use to have Norton Internet Security 2002 and 2003 and loved them both. They would help block unwanted ads and Trojan horses that other people were trying to break in. Yes, they have broken in before because a new directory was created on my hard drive and it was all in spanish (that was before I bought either).I bought 2004 hoping it would be better. It wasn't that easy to install, menus where not very helpful, baffling to set up and it make the computer run real slow. On top of all that, it made I.E. even slower. My kids love talking with instant messenger, but it won't allow them with the firewall up, so I have to disable that portion just so they can use the internet.Don't get this program since you have to disable a few portions of it just to work right."
1,Give me the virus anytime,"Give me the virus anytime!! Isn't there a grade below 1? I bought a new machine with a trial versions of Norton virus and firewall. I then bought the NIS 2004. When I loaded the new software, the machine would not reboot into windows and kept getting a ""NTLDR file missing"" message. Calls to customer service and tech support gave me the response that basically translates to ""tough"" and ""too bad"". In other words, they offered not help or consideration that their software caused. Now I have to reinstall all my software and all my data is lost. Lesson learned is to back-up before any new software installation and not use a Symantec product again. Although they do speak english, their customer service is terrible!!"
1,Glad I didn't buy it !,"I know it's important to have Net security so I was looking to buy some .I figured I'd stick with Norton for 2004 ,but after reading Amazon's Wonderful reviews I think I'll pass on Norton this year .I'm sure scores and scores of people arn't lying and they all came up with the same problems using Norton 2004 Antivirus.It's scary to think you'd have THAT many problems with an expensive and trusted brand.Because of Norton's formerly good quality I figured I'd stick with it again; it worked last time.But, I figured I'd check with Amazon because of their reviews,which no other web site has,and is a really great feature.So,thanks Amazon and the good reviewers for warning people.I'm sorry Norton let everyone down this time ,but I'm glad the word's out about it.I won't be buying NIS 2004 this year."
3,Glacial - Until I figured out the workaround,"As noted by many others, Internet Security 2004 (and AntiVirus 2004) makes web-browsing about as fun as using a 24.4kb modem. It runs glacially, to be sure.However, there is a workaround, and it entails disabling Java Script in the Auto-Protect Exclusion List. Fundamentally, click on Anti-Virus, Options, Auto-Protect, Exclusions. Add *.js to the list, and it should work a lot better.How this product got out of QA like this is beyond me. It works fine for me now, but what a pain."
1,Freddy Auf Hoher See,"This is the most disappointing CD I have ever purchased. I have an old MGM vinyl by the same title ""Auf Hoher See"" although the song listings differ. Freddy and his back-up singers and musicians sound a lot closer to sailors with melancholy, pride in seamanship, or joy of camraderie on the vinyl. This CD recording is Oktoberfest kitsch in comparison. Would have been nice to listen to samplings before purchase. Do not recommend if you are looking for chanty sound."
4,"Good, considering","Lacking the complete text, which is probably forever lost, this surviving material is still a very entertaining look into Roman life and culture. It offers perspectives that you will find no where else in classical literature, often very humorous. I've wanted to read this text for many years and was not dissapointed when I final picked it up. Those who are reading this review are likely aware of how frequently this work has been cited and referenced by more modern writers, and upon reading it one can easily see why that is so. I recommend it to anyone who is into classics, satire, novels, Swift, etc."
4,Atlantis and Arthur,The Booklist review of this book brings up a good point. It says: [Ancestors of Avalon is] one that telescopes the evocative notion that the otherworldly forces supporting Arthur were remnants of Atlantis.There is another series of books that supports the Atlantis/Arthur connection. The Pendragon Cycle books by Stephen R. Lawhead are a series of well-written books that Zimmer Bradley fans would also enjoy.
4,The Acoustic Versions,"Yes they are pulling out Big Country albums from the woodwork (next it will be Big Country Greatest Hits In Techno). This is the latest offering, a 17 song album of acoustic classics (well some of them). I found this album very clean and the sound is very crisp. You can actually hear every note on the guitars. Some songs sound alot different than the originals (Like ""In A Big Country"", which has a country music influence) and the bongo drums make a big difference to a few of them. My favourites on the album are ""You Dreamer"", ""I'm not Ashamed"" to name a few. Stuart Adamson's vocals shine throughout the album. If your a Big Country fan then you should not go without it."
5,great stuff,Who doesn't like Agatha Christie? I read at night to relax and this is the best of all worlds for that.
3,The Mysterious affair at Styles,"I tried Agathy Christy, once again and remembered why I am not a fan of H.Periot. He tries to be mysterious and secretive and solve the crime with a H-MMM. and it just winds up boring. And I feel like a traitor because Agathy is so highly rated by most everyone else."
2,Good but not the Greatest,We like this soap for our infant and toddler but I am not sold on the fact that it is gentaler on their skin than the regular babysoaps. Cute packageing for gifts though!
2,Best to Pass... two thumbs down,"I love most Christmas movies. However, this one wasn't worth seeing. It is more drama than joy or holiday cheer. Not even a satisfying story. With so many great choices in movies... this may be one to miss."
2,Christmas without snow,"I bought this dvd mainly because Michael Learned was acting in it, but was disappointed. It was such a slow moving show that I lost interest in it shortly after I was watching it."
2,Horrifying Quality . . .,"I tried several times to watch it all the way through but i just couldn't make it. Some good acting, some bad acting . . . heartwarming, kinda cheesy storyline . . . BUT . . . the video quality is horrendous and the audio is terribly muffled. NOT WORTH THE MONEY UNTIL THIS FILM GETS THE QUALITY IT DESERVES!"
3,Boring,This is ia very boring movie. The cover appealed which is why I bought it. Multiple story lines occur throughout which aren't related and then suddenly it seems the drama was all about nothing. Mother Walton should have stayed on the mountain. A movie I'm sure she's still trying to forget!!
2,Not much horror to see...,"INUGAMI shouldn't even be in this collection. It's more a supernatural drama than anything, and the only real horror is the amount of inbreeding that goes on in this movie. Creeepeeee...ISOLA deals with multiple personalities, and ultimately veers off into ""The Outer Limits"" territory and disappears into the lower B MOVIE constellation.SHIKOKU has to have one of the oddest ghost girls of recent memory. She's not scary at all. That's not good. It's like trying to be scared of a Helo Kitty doll.SHADOW OF THE WRAITH works, to a point. It delivers two stories involving the japanese ""Hardy Boys"" who unfotunately have to deal with ghost stalkers and haunted apartments. The haunted apartment story is particularly scary. Watch it ALL THE WAY TO THE END."
5,"I was tired of my 10 yr old daughter getting porn e-mail,","I think the Internet is a good thing for our children, but when I started getting lots of pornographic e-mail sent to my daughter's e-mail account, I got angry. I knew she wasn't going to pornography sites, but couldn't figure out how to block it. This book taught me how to stop the porn e-mail, and use other tips to help her use e-mail safely. I found lots of great sites for her to use too. This was the best book I've bought in years. It was so easy to read. I was surprised at how funny and interesting it was. Thank you, Ms Aftab for being there when so many parents need you."
3,Scam,I bought the Bulls Book and i Hated it because it was 45.00. i maybe would pay .45 for it but i'm not sure i would pay that. Don't buy until they have yored the price.
4,Dummies turned professionals,"This author threw out of the window, the mystery of learning the guitar, and made playing once more fun! I always enjoy your line of thought when reading this material"
2,DEFFINITLY not what i was looking for,"i bought this book expecting to further my knowledge of guitar, me having a pretty good sense of theory found this book to be lacking in many ways, this author obviously is writing this book under the influence that the reader already knows what he is talking about in terms of musical language, if i was a beginner, i would have no idea what he was talking about. He seems the have the idea that just being told to do something is better than telling someone to do something then telling them why. I have to say, i was asking myself why a lot in this book."
2,Better Choices Elsewhere.,"After using Lonely Planet books exclusively to tour Europe, I expected the same thoroughness in this book. I was surprised how incomplete this book is. My friend did pick a better book while in Grand Cayman, unfortunately the title eludes me at this time. Lonely Planet only touches the surface on the available dive sites but if you want quick easy reading without high expectations then this is the book for you."
5,A wonderful book!,"I first read this book as a child. I loved it, and wrote a book report on it. Even as an adult, I still find this book warm and uplifting. When my son was born, he sustained a brain injury that has caused him to be delayed in many areas. I reread Karen, and found strength that other people have gone through tough times. As to the breakup of the Killilea's marriage, this is probably evidence of how little support there was for parents of children with special needs. It can take a toll on a family, even one as bright and cheerful as Karen's. Read this book and be enlightened and encouraged."
3,Extra embellished,"3 1/2This challenging trumpeter offers here the farthest thing away from traditional structure as is possible, and perhaps in haste to prove how outside the box it all is with World fusion, rock instrumentation, and electronic flourishes, almost overpowers the majority of taut writing to be found."
3,A wild comedy with slap-stick humor and one-liners...,"Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) are together once again in this sequel to Shanghai Noon (2000), and this time someone has murdered Chon's father and stolen the Imperial Seal. Together the two heroes travel to England and clues lead them to a person who is in a high position with the Royal family. In order to avenge Chon's father and retrieve the Imperial Seal they have to use subtle finesse and bare knuckles. Shanghai Knights is a wild comedy where slap-stick humor and one-liners are used interchangeably. However, there are moments when the comedy becomes awkward, yet the film leaves the audience with a side-splitting and passable cinematic experience,"
3,Not as good or funny as Shanghai Noon...,"This movie was o.k. but I didn't care for it as much as I did Shanghai Noon. In Shanghai Noon I couldn't stop laughing but I didn't find that I laughed but a time or two in Shanghai Knights. The bloopers at the end gave me many more laughs then the actual movie did. I thought the vase scene was way to fake & didn't make a whole lot of sense. I don't plan on watching it again. To be honest, I just saw the movie yesterday & can't remember most of it. It's just not a movie that's going to stick with you. I'd say skip this movie."
2,One lead too many makes for a dull movie.,"I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception. It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong. These two actors were great as a team. Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot. When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring. Why was he even cast in this film? This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again nor do I recommend it to others."
1,I truly wish I had read the reviews here before buying!,"I use some other Norton products, and have been relatively happy with them. However, the Antispam product is the very worst software I have ever encountered. It seemed to work for about 1 hour, then it crashed Outlook. Fortunately, Outlook has something built in to disable bad add in software, which is just what it did with Norton Antispam. Unfortunately, in the process of disabling Norton Antispam, Outlook also disabled parts Norton AntiVirus - what a mess. Do not expect any help from Norton either. They asked be for $70 to fix there two products. I passed. I had to uninstall both Outlook and Norton AntiVirus then reinstall to make it work again. Buyer Beware of this product."
4,Works for me,"I have been using this product for about six months now and have had great results. It works well with Outlook Express. It doesn't catch everything, but it does catch many spam messages and filter them into a spam folder. My only complaint is that it only works with my pop account, not with my Hotmail account that I read in Outlook Express."
1,Norton doesn't BLOCK Spam,Norton AntiSpam will correctly indentify Spam as (Norton AntiSpam) in your Inbox. It will not block Spam even after repeated messages from the same sender.Norton AntiSpam Tech Support will give a canned answer that is already in the users manual. They will ignore any questions not covered in the Users Manual.Norton AntiSpam is JUNKWARE.
2,Trouble in the Trial Phase!!!,"I tried downloading AntiSpam trial version to see how I like it,I noticed within days that when I download my email it has slowed the process down considerable. I use netscape and when I download my email daily (about 60-70) it seems to bog down. I hope they decide to remedy this challenge. I think I'll pass for now!"
1,Debug,Faithful follower of Symantec until now but the error Bullock refers to below afflicts me and many others. Symantec wake up and acknowledge you have a problem!!!!
3,rfrance,"Nice sheets but read the description carefully. I thought I was purchasing the set(fitted sheet, flat sheet and pillow cases) but I was wrong. That was my fault. But when I went to buy the flat sheet and pillow cases for King size in Jade they weren't in stock. Not only out of stock on Amazon but everywhere on the web. I ended up buying the Springmaid 350 Threadcount King Set in Moss at Walmart for $52.64 plus shipping."
5,Great Gift for a fan.,This was a gift so I can't comment on the actual product. I just wanted to say it came quick and packaged well. I do know it was a hard to find DVD locally so was happy to find it quick and reasonably priced.
4,"Good Resource, needs more","For those of you who dont like the fact that the juicy details that were in the 3.5x resource kit arent in the 4.0 resource kit. There is a reason, the 4.0 kit was meant to be a supplement to the 3.5x kit. I could never get Microsoft to publicly admit it though."
4,Latte Eddie Bauer Deluxe High Back Booster Review,"Not a bad purchase although it arrived in a throughly crushed shipping box from BabyAge. A company that never returned my inquiry re: safety of seat after poorly handled UPS shipping. Other than my concerns about the long term durability of the seat on arrival (you could defintely make out all contours of the booster seat through the crushed box!) the harness buckle seems a bit snug & I worry that we'll need to switch to seatbelt restraint too soon. My 12 month old son is 90% for height, 75% head circumference & onlyEddie Bauer Deluxe High Back Booster Latte25% for weight."
5,Excellent introductory book with surprising depth,"I have read both the paperback and Kindle version of this book. I found it to be excellent pre-reading prior to my first stint in anaesthesia (as an ICU trainee), and have referred back to it quite often. It is easy to read, and gives an excellent broad overview of how to give a good anaesthetic. The depth was just right - i learnt more than I expected regarding areas such as the circle system from this book, which made life much easier on my first day on the job. Highly recommended."
3,Could help you teach medical students in theatre,"I thought it was an introductory text, but it reads more like the transcript of an in theatre medical student tutorial. Very verbose and not organized like a handbook or textbook."
2,"Parts and Instructions Do Not Correspond, you'll get 75 pieces, just can't build their picture","I just received this and the instructions comes with step by step instructions to build 2 different log house versions. I (the parent) tried to follow the instructions and found that you simply cannot put together the house they've shown. There are 75 pieces, just not enough as shown one their instruction sheets, you're child will just have to put one together with his/her own imagination or follow the directions one third of the way through and then put a roof on instead of building a taller log house per instructions, there's simply not enough pieces to put what is shown on their instruction sheet/picture ad. Hence I gave it 2 stars as it's false advertising."
2,Legend,I think there's really no rating for this book; it is to each one to choose.This book is what legends are made of! ...Maybe the author wanted to create a legend here.
4,Reads like a textbook,"I wouldn't be surprised if this book was used as a text for a college class. It reads like one. That's not to say that the book isn't interesting. Starbird's research is presented in a very scholarly and interesting way. It just took me awhile to get through it. I bought this book to fill in the blanks of my own knowledge concerning Mary Magdalen. After reading THE DA VINCI CODE, I had to know more. If you, too, have just read THE DA VINCI CODE, I would suggest starting with HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL. Starbird wrote THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR after reading HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL herself. Don't get me wrong. Starbird's book is extremely interesting and contains a lot of evidence for Mary Magdalen being Christ's lost bride. I just wish I had read HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL first."
2,Unreferenced work,"I am very interested in this subject matter and am not a religious fanatic (only a recovering Catholic!). I am, however, a scientist and must know where any information is coming from for it to be of any use. I am assuming this book is not a fictional work.The first chapter is a ""story"" about some biblical-sounding folk ""The Lost Bride"". However, there is no reference, background, or anything given for the story itself. Who wrote it? When was it written? Is it from the Gnostic gospels? Did the author fabricate it? Where did it come from? I.e. - why should I care about this story???I put the book down and haven't picked it up since."
4,A theory ... worthy of contemplation.,"Margaret Starbird was one of the first to elaborate at length about the idea that Mary Magdalen was more than just the irrelevant aquaintance of Jesus that the Bible tries to make her. Like Margaret Starbird, I feel that these thoughts do not reduce my faith or ar in any way blasphemous. The God I believe in wants us to question, to learn and to grow. Margaret Starbird and her book helps us to do so. 4 stars for the writing style, which could be more exciting."
5,So interesting,I can't believe I waited so long to read this book - I am interested in religious topics and this author is fabulous. Super easy read and she makes her point/argument without a lot of fluff. I am currently studying religious archeology and I wish I would have gotten this book months ago.... even if you are not interested in using this book as a text book; its still a very interesting read. Enjoy
3,Good overall phone - with a few issues,"The ""CONFERENCE"" feature is useless - while you can hear each of the other two parties, they cannot hear each other at all. My other big complaint is that if I'm sending or receiving a fax on line 2, I can hear the fax tone on line 1. Makes it pretty touch to carry on a conversation. I suspect this is the same issue inside the electronics - not enough shielding between the lines."
1,"I don't know that I have ever felt more ""ripped off"" with a product bought from Amazon","I bought this book quite some time ago and only the 1st two reviews appeared here on Amazon at that time. The author of the book and his mom must have been those first two entries. Please don't spend your money on the collection of nothing. If you don't believe me on this try to find any mention of this book or author on the internet and then decide for yourself. I would have given zero stars, but that is not an option."
3,"Bonnie Pointer solo Motown album ""Red""","Bonnie Pointer made two solo albums for Motown and both were called BONNIE POINTER. One has her picture of her head with earrings on a red background, the other has a picture of her head with flowers in her hair on a blue background. (I call them the RED or the BLUE albums). There is different music on each, the blue has a few covers of older (mostly Mowtown)music, like JIMMY MACK. The track listing for this RED album is: 1: WHEN I'M GONE, 2: FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, 3: HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, 4: AH SHOOT, 5: MORE AND MORE, 6: I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, 7: I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD), 8: MY EVERTHING. / The song HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a single, it was even released as a ""Disco Single Remix"" with a longer disco sound. I've owned both the Red and Blue albums and I personally think the Red album is the better album."
3,Good!.,"I like the Police Academy movies, I actully watched Police Academy 2 and 3 before I watched the first movie and I think this movie is good and has a great cast but especially Steve Guttenberg, G.W. Bailey and Bubba Smith and I recommend this movie. BTW: While the rest of the movies in The Police Academy series were Rated PG 13 I think it should be pointed out that the first movie is actually Rated R."
4,Police Academy (20th Anniversary Special Edition) ~ G.W. Bailey,"Police Academy (20th Anniversary Special Edition)~ G.W. Bailey is the only good movie of them all. Guttenberg plays an amazing role, and the script is not as paper thinn as the rest of the sequells. This makes the rest of movies look look the winner of the nobel prize. The dialogue is not as horrid as the later sequells either but is kind of well developed. I love tackleberry the Vietnam craze and all the other steroetypical charachters in this movie. I also love the blue eyester bar scene. The rest of the movie is filled with typical 80's stereotypical view of society which was normal at the time. It is also a time capsule for the music (Frankie Goes to Hollywood is played in one scene), the fashion (the tacky clothes) and everything else that was like ""in fashion"" during the 80's. Highly recommended indeed."
2,Overkill,"The author takes 210 pages to come to a conclusion that is apparant after 50. The same information is repeated time after time until the reader can close one's eyes and know the next line (or at least the one after) will mention Banks or Butler or Logan, with nothing that has not already been said about any of them."
1,Horrible,The OUATIC saga hit rock bottom with this fiasco. Everybody assumed that the series would hit rock bottom with the fourth movie without Jet Li but that was a pretty good addition to the saga but you can't say the same about this mess. What happened with this one?! The story looked like the writers had a little too much to drink when they were developing the plot for this weak entry...what a shame...this series deserves better....
4,So-so,"Required some critical thinking from the reader in the sense that seems to be bias toward the Clintons, I prefered Maraniss's."
3,"Good read, angry conservatives still bitter about Nixon","This book was a good read and Miss Olsen has a good grasp of the english language. But, to be short and sweet, this is just right wing conservative drivel that is still trying to drag Mister Clinton through the mud. Now that we have another draft dodging president and a former cocaine user in the White House, I understand that is must be difficult to find someone to to tarnish. When I read the ""exploits"" of misses Clinton, it sounded more to me like a Rush Limbaugh tirade then actual research. Basically she talks alot, but, she does not SAY anything. Clinton got busted for sex, Nixon got busted for abusing the Power of the CIA and the FBI and paying theives and assasisns to spy on his enemies. I will take a ""draft dodging inhaler"" any day over the Nixon type slime that she seems to be secretly defending."
2,A book about two topics: pardon and donation.,"I listened to the audio version of this book. While most of the things said in this book may be true, it appears a bit biased. In addition to facts, the author uses some adjectives which show her personal dislike of the famous couple.In the end, I had an impression that this book grew out of author's frustration upon Mark Rich pardon. Many chapters are dedicated to that case.A disproportionately large portion of the book is devoted to two topics: pardon and donations. At one point the audio book spends a large amount of time only listing names of who donated what item. It goes on and on and on with names that make no sense and contribute nothing much to the story. That could have been moved to the appendix to keep the flow going.I was hoping to find details about mischievious behavior by Clinton staff during the last days. There was no mention of that."
1,"Oh, come on","After almost 2 years of the Bush administration, do you can you really believe a word this woman had to say? Read David Brock's Blinded by the Right if you want to know where she is coming from."
4,Large Mouse for Small hands,"The software that comes with this mouse is great, especially since it allows you to assign different uses for the buttons for each program you use. This greatly increases the functionality of this mouse and eases the burden on my wrists. The only drawback is that the size is too large for small hands like mine. So perhaps it will force me to purchase another one to prevent my carpel tunnel from getting worse instead of helping. I'm waiting to see."
5,Comfortable Easy to Use Wireless Mouse,"Logitech makes some great mice, and this is no exception. Plug it in and it works. Fits my hand well (typical size male hands). Buttons have a solid feel. You can turn the ""clicks"" in the scroll wheel on and off, which is a nice option depending on what you're scrolling. I'll be interested to see how long the batteries last."
4,"Well at least I liked it,,,","This was an impulse buy for me as a boxing day sale for 20 bucks. I think they had the regular price at $89.98 and upon using it I would have paid full price as it is well worth it. The extra buttons are completely customizable upon installing quickset (from either the logitech website for the most current version or from the installation disk that comes with it). The batteries practically last forever it runs off of 2 double a's. I like the bigger feel two, I contemplated buying the vx nano but decided it was too small for my feakishly large hands. I also have the vx revo which I use with my notebook (I use the 620 for my media center with a dinovo keyboard). I think the vx revo is prettier but the mx 620 is more comforable. I don't know why this has such a poor rating it's just like everything else logitech has put out."
5,Logitech MX620,"first time shopper for mouse. Usually use whatever is in the pkg. deal. I'm not a gamer, just wanted something comfortable, simple, easy to install, durable. You know, the best bang for your buck. This satisfies all this criteria plus . . . I'm a happy camper for half the price!"
2,Does not function on most surfaces,"Best thing is the scroll wheel - one flick and you can almost go to the end of a document. However, still trying to find a surface it's compatible with. Does NOT function on most surfaces. Standard mouse pads, 3M Precise Mousing Surface, wood & shiny paper are all out. Works so-so on paper (a little slow) or shiny plastic (a little fast).The mouse does NOT have wheels, but DOES have flat rubbery 'feet' (for want of a better word) - which accounts for the difficulty.Haven't owned it long enough to know about the battery. And, unless I can find a surface to use it on, I might not have it long enough to know if it lasts the year that it claims."
2,Big Disappointment Compared to MX 610,"I received this mouse as a replacement for my MX 610, which was probably the best mouse I ever had. This model is nowhere near as responsive as the 610 was and does not have as good a tracking either. They removed both the volume buttons and the notifications lights for emails and IMs. Instead they give you the completely worthless look up button which lets you highlight a word and search for it, whoopty freaking do.The only nice thing about it is the surface of the side grips, that is a slight improvement. Overall my placement 620 will sit in a box as a back up. I managed to find an MX 610 replacement. Try to find them since they are now discontinued."
5,First year teachers...here are some excellent ideas!,"The Best of the Mailbox for the intermediate level offers fun and exciting ideas for units, bulletin boards, cooperative learning, arts and crafts and so much more. After just graduating college, I was timid about how to get my classroom started and decorated but this instructional book helped me so much. It is a little old fashioned in some ways but it has some colorful ideas to really brighten up the classroom. I've really enjoyed it and I have saved so much time! It is a great resource!"
5,Moth Pick Of The Week,"Discovered by Roger Taylor of Queen fame, Wire Daisies is alternative rock band in the vein of The Cranberries, The Bangles, and 10,000 Maniacs. Their self-titled album is simply fantastic. From beginning to end, each track effortlessly weaves in and out of various tempos, yet still maintains the feel of an actual album without falling into the mainstream quagmire of ""just another collection of songs.""The opening track ""Make Every Thing Change"" easily brings to mind such bands as 10,000 Maniacs except updated and with more of a raw edge about them. In fact, the lead singer Treana Morris for some reason puts me in mind of Dido, that is if Dido had been infused with more of a rock vibe.Between such tracks as ""Gay Boy,"" ""Rocket Girl,"" and ""Mary Jane,"" Wire Daisies is an album with strong hooks that dig in deep and don't let go."
5,excellent book.,"The cricket as perhaps my favorite childhood story, I still find it interesting to read from time to time."
4,Cricket and Time Square,"I found that this book is very entertaining and enjoyable. It is about a little boy Mario, who has a cricket named Cricket. This cricket is just no cricket, he has special talents. To find out what special talents and the relationship with the book, then read this book."
4,You would love this book,"This book is the best adventurest book I've ever read. There are three little friends named Harry,Tucker,and Chester. A cat,mouse,and a cricket. There are a few reasons why I like this book. The characters are very interesting. I would love to read this book again. Chester cricket came from Connecticut. He never intened to leave,it just happened. He met two friends named Harry and Tucker evrn a little boy named Mario.Tucker and Harry taught Chester a few tricks in the city but Chester a little country cricket taught them a few to.My favorite part was the end because chester left everyone was so upset they didn't know why he left I was also wondering why did he leave. Maybe he felt homesick. I don't know about you but I definatly loved this book."
3,Does not provide ground isolation!,"I bought this product to help with working on power supply circuits. I wanted it to provide isolation from ground after being shocked once too often. Unfortunately this product has the output neutral line tied to ground, which makes it useless for this purpose. This can be easily corrected by disconnecting one wire inside, so I'm still giving it 3 stars because it works very well once that is done. Its also well made and provides good isolation from RF noise."
5,Hell's Angels,I enjoyed learning about how the Hell's Angels got started with their club. I liked the interviews and how it explained from beginning to end how the club expanded. I was surprised on how the club grew and expanded into other parts of the world. I didn't know that about them. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in the history of the Hell's Angels.
3,So-So documentary,"Informative, But overpriced and not in- depth and complete according to other accounts. If you want to know about the HA, I would suggest reading Sonny Barger's book ""Hells Angels""."
1,Unbelievably slow,"My McAfee license just ran out, so I figured I'd give Norton Antivirus a try. What a mistake. I thought something was wrong with my computer for a couple of days until I decided to try uninstalling Norton. It made my web access unbelievably slow, I'm talking molasses-like."
1,BUGGY!!!,"BUGGY! Installation took more than an hour following the suggested full system san before and after.""Post Installation Wizzard"" hangs everytime you reboot. Followed every suggestion on the help session, including uninstall and re-install in safe mode. Did not help.I have got far enough so it will now start EXCEPT ""auto-protect"". Where is the point if the s/w doesn't protect your PC automatically? Am I suppode to allow my PC to be infected and manually scan and clean it everytime before I shut it down?Other than the on-line help (which did not solve problem), help does not exist unless you are willing to pay per incident or per minute. Good thing I bought it with a rebate. I guess I would stick with it and wait for another product that will offer a competitive product rebate..."
3,MEMORY NOW OR THEN,"I HAVE JUST RECIEVED THIS BOOK , BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE READ SO FAR IT APPEARS TO BE QUIT INTERESTING AND WORTH CONTINUING WITH EACH CHAPTER.AUTHOR PROVIDES MANY EXAMPLES OF TESTING OR SEARCHING FOR MEMORY. MANY VIEWS FROM PASSED SCIENTIST AND DOCTORS."
3,Boring (to me),"Had to read it for a psychology class.I'm usually a bookworm, but honestly I found this book to be boring.A friend of mine from the same class liked it though, so I guess it depends on your preference.I would suggest reading the first few pages before buying just to see if you like the author's style of writing (which is what I had problems with)."
2,Fair...,"For Matt Franklin and his comrades in arms, robbing a Securicor van should have been a routine operation but things didn't turn out the way they should have and the result was a disaster. Two of Franklin's companions are shot dead and a third one severely injured. Who is trying to wipe them and their families out? Could it be that the British army and government were implicated in the massacre? What lies behind the walls of a mysterious and secret research centre in the English countryside?Finally the only one left alive, Matt Franklin, with the help of DI Crane, becomes involved in a series of events that lead to the climax in the London underground.Such novels are to literature what instant soups are to gastronomy. They taste bad because the ingredients are miserable: guns, cars, blood, explosions, pursuits... But readers possessing the necessary degree of naiveté might be content with such a story line."
2,Disappointing,"Very forgettable. Can't remember much about it in detail, just that we never play it. Might try and find it and give it another spin but as I recall, not what we expected. Sorry!"
4,Good historical account,"Good book, very fact filled and well researched. The author was very knowledgeable about the subject, however it was a little more detailed than I wanted. It was written at a higher level than I would have liked. I believe the author was aiming for a more academic crowed, and I'm just a dabbler in this subject. I knew nothing about the subject and now I know a whole lot more.However, since I knew nothing to start with, I was very fascinated by the whole idea of the spirit of democracy of the time being manifest in the church of the time. Whether it was good or bad I will not give an opinion and the author did a good job of sticking to the facts and leaving his opinion out of the copy as much as possible.If this area of study interests you, I would recommend the book. If it's only a passing fancy of a possible interesting read, you might want to think twice."
5,beer bottle shirt,"this shirt is very nice. the size is very generous in size. I don't know how it washes yet, as it is a gift."
4,"Good, but hardly his best","I love Trollope. He is my favorite nineteenth-century British writer. His style suits me down to the ground. I'd like anything he's written. I have twenty of his books lined up on a shelf. When I want a great treat, I pull one down and read it.I got several chuckles out of poor Cousin Henry vacillating between his desire to do right and his desire to do wrong. Still, I don't think anyone besides the other reviewer here would call COUSIN HENRY Trollope's best book."
1,She Calls Me Caroline,I have met the author. She is a horrible person and nobody should buy this book. I know first hand that she uses people and is nothing to be admired. In short she is evil. Don't buy this book because you don't want to support her.
3,Dr seusse,Horton hears a who is a cute family film but it also has a serious underlying message a few don't pressure your children to follow in your foot steps and listen to their desires realise the world may be bigger then you think and never think you always know best. See this film and you will enjoy it Steven Carell and Jim Carry give great performances and it provides a good family comedy.
3,3 and 1/2 stars actually,"Once again, they replace the simple moral theme of a classic story with convoluted cheezy and dated humor. When are they going to learn that good stories can be serious, or at least have a serious scene or two without the one-liners cluttering the writing. Children can be drawn in for other reasons. One of my favorite films as a kid was Alice in Wonderland. You'd have to stretch to find a one-liner anywhere in that film, yet kids even today still love it. Life isn't always about a laugh. I'm getting sick of the recycled fart type jokes cluttering kids movies these days. With all of that said, this Movie was better than I expected (it did retain a lot of the magic from the book and the cartoon while only bringing in bad humor once and awhile), but much worse than it could have been."
5,Horton Hears a Who,"I watched this at the Theather with my daughter... Love it, she loved the movie so much that I purchased it for her."
4,I am starting to hear a who,"We do not watch a lot of TV in my house, but for some reason I put this in my sons stocking along with happy feet.Since christmas we have watched a lot of horton and I am starting to think I hear a who everyone in a while, but it is just my son asking to watch horton."
3,Not what i hoped!,"It is a cute movie ! But some of the things they say are not age appropriate for kids. they call people ""blathering boob's"""
5,Horton Hears a Who,Horton Hears a Who DVD was for my granddaughter. This is a new item and the best part is...the price was perfect.
5,Thank you,"I have not watched this yet but the price was the best, i love the movie seen it before decided it was time to own it. The package came in time and wraped, new and i thank you so much,"
5,Horton Hears a Who,"This is a delightful movie, and one children will enjoy watching over and over. A great family film."
5,Cute!,"If you like the story, which of course you do. You'll love this film. Great voices and beautiful animation."
5,too cute,"The voice acting in this movie is wonderful. Of course the animation is awesome as well...but its fun to hear all the famous voices pop up throughout the movie. Jim Carrey is wonderful as Horton...he carries the movie well. I also just love Katie...she is a small character that has limited air time, but she definitely stands out. I recommend this movie to kids & adults both!"
1,"clever, but not exciting",This movie was purchased for my 9-year old and 5-year old grandsons. They like fast paced animation and this just wasn't it.
2,Macro central,"Having never read this author before, I did not know she was a macrobiotics enthusiast. I just wanted some general information on improving my diet. I'm not interested in macrobiotics. However, in perusing the book, it seemed to be very detailed and comprehensive. It also seemed to be very labor intensive. If you're into macrobiotics, I guess it's a labor of love. It just wasn't for me."
4,After-death released poems,This book of Bukowski's work was released by his wife after he died. Some good stuff in here. its hard to tell if they werent released because he didnt theink them good enough while he was alive or these works were simply ready not for prime-time yet while he was living.
3,Herp Textbook,"I have just finished an undergradute course which used this book as the main text. I agree with the previous reviewer that there is considerable overlap and occasional contradiction. The early chapters tend to use a lot of technical jargon, and seem to be written for people who already understand the material. I was not so impressed with phylogenic descriptions which frequently failed to discuss unifying characteristics within families. Later sections, including locomotion, water balance, and mate selection are well written. This book would benefit from a glossary, more relevant tables and figures, and a more inclusive index. Overall, editing is rather sketchy."
4,LOVE THIS TOWN,WONDERFUL it stands alone well but you will enjoy it to its fullest by reading the entire series. It reminds you what small towns are like
1,Ramblings By a Non-Expert,"Don't waste your time or your money. Why would anybody want to read a book about homeland security (given all such a title entails) by an information security geek? Well, if you do fall for it, that's exactly what you will get.For a more complete, expert treatment of homeland security issues, I recommend Richard Clarke's book Against All Enemies or Dan Verton's book, Black Ice: The Invisible Threat of Cyber-Terrorism."
3,Good Primer for Homeland Security,"Very interesting book. Gives a good overview of the Homeland Security status and effectively illustrates the futile efforts to protect everything ultimately protects nothing. Also good effort describing the ""shark feed"" of vendors sopping up billions in tax dollars by trotting out dubious products and services to address Homeland Security. The book diverges in Chapter 9 Electronic Pearl Harbor where it is written more for an Information Technology type."
1,Ha!,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!This book is ridiculous. It's hard to believe that people take this seriously.
2,Not enough Francis,"If you like Chesterton then you'll probably like this book. However, he can get on my nerves. I was wanted to learn about Francis. When I finished the book I thought, ""You know, I didn't learn a thing. Chesterton told me the little I already knew about Francis."" Yet for some reason it took Chesterton 158 pages to tell me so little. This isn't a biography. It is GK's commentary on what he thinks about Francis in relation to modernity."
1,Poor quality and support,"Setup is ok, but not for a novice. Not exactly easy. However, the quality is poor. The fan burned out in about 1 year and the company does not offer an out of warrently repair program (even though I was willing to pay). After many calls to support where i repeatedly recieved incorrect information, they basically said too bad, I have to fix it myself. In addition, the fan is a ""special"" fan that has to be ordered from a 3rd party, but Buffalo does not know the part number for the fan - so good luck getting it from a distributor. IF you are putting data on the drive that you dont want to risk losing then I suggest avoiding the product and company."
4,Excellent device,"Set up went smoothly and fast, no issues whatsoever with the function of the unit. Two small complaints, one is the noise generated by the fan - too loud in my opinion. I have it located in my basement so no big deal but if it was on my desk I would be going carzy. Also the face of the unit keeps palling off. It is just a thin facia made of plastic and the glue doesn't hold it well. Again, no biggie but it is a problem. I have been using the device for a couple of months now with no issues ever."
5,Must have SOHO network storage device,"Easy to setup, easy to administer... an easy to setup a back up.. tHIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR NETWORK STORAGE AND DOES NOT HAVE A SERVER.Only one complaint.... Password can only be 8 spaces long. Hopefully this will be changed in a future rev. Buffalo Tech seems to have some problems allowing long passwords...I am sure they will come around, I tried several products and this is the easiest most full featured I have seen."
2,Not as good as the first Fantastic Voyage,"As the previous reviewer points out, the first Fantastic Voyage was not Asimov's story, but merely his novelization of the movie plot. So Asimov decided to write his own story on the same theme. Unfortunately, his was not as good as the original.Asimov had an enormous ego (if he was called ""The Great Explainer"", as the previous reviewer notes, I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn that Asimov gave himself the title). He often bragged about the huge volume of output from his typewriter. The problem is that quantity does not equal quality, and much of his writing wasn't worth much. This book falls into that category."
2,Not What I Expected,"After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a good book. After reading the first four chapters, I deceided to return it because I believe it is not direct and to the point; there is way too much description to make a simple point."
1,ABSOLUTELY horrible,"I've read this twice. The first time I read it was the early 90's.. apparently I forgot how much I disliked it, because I picked it up and read it again in 2000. I hated it. Halfway through, reading it became a chore. It was mostly just a bunch of senseless babble with no real plot. You knew what was going to happen from the very beginning.I'd suggest picking up one of his better novels. Start with Lightning, Strange Highways I was real fond of too. Plus the Fear Nothing and Sieze the Nights books were pretty good.Stay away from this one is my opinion. :)"
2,Wanted: one good editor,"What a disappointment. This would have made a tight, suspenseful short story, but is stretched way too thin to be a successful novel. Nearly a hundred pages given to a subplot involving a drug shootout and the neurotic exploits of a cop's wife? Come on, was that really necessary? This subplot has no bearing whatsoever on the remainder of the story. The plot was unfolding in Montana not in LA. No, it didn't even lend itself to advancing character development since the characters are very boring and stilted (Ed being the exception). I found myself skimming through much of the first half of the novel. I believe this book is a good example of cut-n-paste editing in order to meet a deadline."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars....A gripping chokehold of a novel,"A good enjoyable light read from the master of suspense, DEAN KOONTZ!!Jack McGarvey relocates his family to small-town Montana where they live in a ranch, left to them by Jack's murdered partner. Strange things start to happen, raising Jack's LA detective antenna; mutilations. Aliens invade the town and try to kill off ""townies.""Not his best, but not his worst by a long shot!! Slow start hurts, but the KILLER ending more than makes up for it!! For the most part, Koontz paces it well and his trademark characters are the real reason to purchase this interesting read!!For those of u who didn't like it, TRY WRITING sometime! It isn't as easy as it looks! It takes real talent to consistently churn out novels like DK does! He is one of the few who turn out quality after quality!!"
2,Killer Tomatoes Eat France,"Professor Gangreen and his gang of killer tomatoes take off to Europe to fulfill an ancient prophecy that would make his idiotic assistant, Igor, the new king of France, leaving it up to Michael and everyone's favorite Fuzzy Tomato to stop their evil plan! Get ready for more Grade-A cheese in KILLER TOMATOES EAT FRANCE, the fourth and final film in the KILLER TOMATOES franchise. John De Bello and friends put their own silly spin on The Man in the Iron Mask, with series favorite Steve Lundquist playing out the duel roles as both Igor and the future king, Louis the XXVII. The tomatoes have retained their animated features from the third film for more goofy fun as they take to the stage in a rocking music number before heading out to the battlefields to squash more humans. The groan-worthy gags and outlandish humor still make for more guilty entertainment, while you can expect every possible French cliché to be properly exploited.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,The most emo book ever written...so far,"I fell in love with this book. It's about a little punk rocker named Alex who lives in Italy. I wanted to hang out with Alex and just have coffee with him by the end of the book. This has gotta be the most emotional book ever written, so if you are into emo, read this book NOW. You'll love it. I also wholeheartedly reccomend this book to anybody else who loves reading emotional books. Totally great. Changed my life and perspective on everything."
2,"""clockwork orange meets beat generation""","This book is so irritating for someone who knows something about books. Stile of writing is just like in the book ""clockwork orange"" : main character is named Alex (get the idea),everithing is named ""old this"" ,""old that"" or ""your narator"", the guy even wrote it on some imaginative language like ""clockwork orange"" is also. I'm telling you this should be named ""clockwork orange meets beat generation""."
4,True Love,"I got this book from: bloggingforbooks.Everyone wishes to be loved forever and ever. Every little girl dreams to meet her knight in shining armor or is waiting for a prince charming to sweep her off to his castle. As the bride goes down to meet the groom at the end of the red carpet, friends and family are writing their story down. As we go through life, we oftentimes make our lists and expect God to generate our boyfriends into our liking. God has already made the perfect guy for our lives and He's just waiting to give him to you in His own timing.In this riveting novel that I could not put down, it drew me to the theme of the book. It is talking about how Trevin laying down his life to win the heart of the princess. In this case, it is the prince charming that is trying to win a girl's heart.This book is even better than the Sword and the Eye."
3,Don't expect rebates,"Works ok on my xp equipted computer. It does take a lot of resources to run.If yours comes with two rebates, don't expect the second one. I backed up all my information and resubmitted it. They refused it a second time. The state I live in has a rebate return law. If you don't get the rebate, you can return the product. Guess what's going back."
1,Disappointed,"This is my 3rd Symantec product that I have purchased. The other two I was very happy with. This one wouldn't install on my computer. The software asked me to reinstall it twice. My computer locked up completely. The online help is only good if you can use your computer. My fourth time of deleting the software I wrote to Symantec and they are going to try to respond in four to five business days. Considering Norton's has always been good in the pass, at this point I would try a different product."
1,ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,OWNED THE PRODUCT FOR 10 YEARS. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PRICES FOR RENEWAL YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO GET THE LOWEST PRICE. THERE IS NO NO NO NO CUSTOMER SERVICE --UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT BY THE MINUET AND PROGRAM WILL SLOW YOUR SYSTEM DOWN CONSIDERABLY -- GET READY FOR TONS OF JUNK MAIL.BUT THE ANTI VIRUS WORKS HHHMMMMMM OR IS IT MICROSOFT UPDATES?
1,Nortons antivirus 2004,I bought Nortons 2004 and it says that i have to enter the activation code but when i type it in the next button is not highlighted so i cannot activate it ......it also comes up with an error and i have uninstalled previous version and other programs and shut down and restarted many times .....all i get is problems ......now i use another online scanner but i am just off to the store to try to explain this to get my money back ...wish me luck ( i have used nortons successfully for several years so i understand that we all have different setups and something may be clashing with this new version ... i have also done a search on the error and nortons admit that there is a problem but as yet they havent got an answer )
1,I hate this Anti Virus,"I'm disappointed that it doesn't clean the system of spyware and adware!! Oh why did I buy this? I must have been on crack! I should've bought Spyware and adware removal tool instead of this crap. It would probably be good for detecting and erasing viruses but not spyware and adware, which I recently learn is more dangerous than viruses. Oh man, tough luck for me that I paid Norton $50 bucks of my mom's money and didn't even turn in the stupid $10 rebate that came with it because it was to expire ""VERY"" soon. :-( A sad ending to this product review."
1,Antivirus is nearly as bad as the virus,"I bought this product to replace the 2003 version. BIG MISTAKE! Multiple attempts (seven) to download and install the product were unsuccessful. I had success downloading and installing earlier versions, the last being 2003. Norton Antivirus 2003 is a wonderful product; but the 2004 version has multiple problems that I, an experienced program downloader, could not overcome. I had to uninstall 2004 and reinstall 2003 in order to remain protected. Worse than the 2004 version, is Symantic's appalling lack of customer support. Buyers should expect to solve all Symantic product problems without assistance."
1,Norton SystemWorks 2004,"I paid $54.99 for this product and it loaded and looks real pretty. Gee it would be nice if Symantec had put on the installation disk the lusetup.exe file. This means that the product purchased is worthless as you can not get Live Updates without that lusetup.exe file. Don't bother trying to download it over a weekend, Symantec is closed for business then. Once you get the lusetup.exe file executed, you still can't get Live Updates, you either get error 1853 or 1814 or any error they would like to give you. I am returning the product for a more user friendly one, not Norton."
1,Warning..Symantec products corrupt each other,"Oh boy...if you have Norton Firewall 2003 on the machine and Antivirus 2003 on the machine, you may be in for it. I upgraded to Norton Antivirus 2004, and the Firewall software is now corrupted. I get the pleausre of going through the nightmare of deinstalling both products to try to resolve the problem. Makes me really confident when a software company can't get it's OWN products to work together. It may be time to move on to the competition at this point (since I had the same problem with LAST years programs). How the mighty have fallen"
3,Extremely difficult to install,"This product was extremely difficult to install. We followed all the directions to a T and worked with the tech support. Tech support is ok but we were dealing via email with someone in India I believe. We finally had to call our PC mfgr Dell to uninstall and reinstall everything including windows, and then we were able to install Norton. Since then Norton has worked fine. So maybe we had some sort of Virus, but if so, Norton and no other virus software ever detected such a virus. I give it 3 stars because of the difficult installation, 5 stars since then."
1,Stay with Nav2003,"Norton is and will probably continue to be the benchmark for antivirus protection. The problem being, this seems to have gone to there heads... If your system is running Windows 2K/XP you will ""PROBABLY"" not encounter many problems other than a drop in system performance... on the other hand, if you are running Windows 98/se be afraid, be very afraid. DO NOT INSTALL NAV2004 ON WIN98/SE SYSTEM'S...... best advise, purchase the virus defintion update for NaV2003.of course this is just my informed opinion, I have installed over 30 copies for our clients and this is what I have found in a real world situation.."
2,Antivirus at what cost,"I've used Norton antivirus on ME and didn't have any problems, but when I changed to XP everything that could go wrong went wrong and the reason was Norton antivirus, it just doesn't seem to work right with XP. My system was running at a snails pace, and just wouldn't act right. Couldn't find out what was wrong with my computer it was working fine and then it wasn't. I tried everything to fix it and then started thinking about the time that all the trouble started. It was just after Norton Antivirus was installed, I removed Norton and the computer was back to normal, on line working great. I changed over to another Antivirus and everything now is working great again."
5,Good Upgrade,"I upgraded to this Norton AV and found no problems. I have been using Norton products starting with their first utility in the old days of DOS only. Over the years I have found that most, if not all, problems with installation are due to various Windows versions and rarely the product itself. For best results your computer should have a robust amount of RAM. I am on the Internet 24/7 and download tons of stuff and get almost 1,000 e-mails a day and Norton has never let me down. I have never been hit with a virus or worm and I know that is due to Norton AV products."
1,Doesn't load; Charges $30 for technical assistance,"I just bought Norton Antivirus 2004 for a new computer with Windows XP. The product will not load. When the licensing window comes up, it cannot be read in its entirety. There is no ""accept"" or ""decline"" checkbox. Your choices are ""cancel"" and ""back."" Symantec now charges $30 for technical assistance per incident -- nearly the cost of the software -- so I opted to exchange it for McAfee, which loaded easily."
4,"A good product, butvery pricey","With so many products on the market,Neogyn was recommended by a professional and it worked very well in relieving pain."
1,Boy was I wrong!,"I certainly feel like a jack a**. I was a sheep like the rest of the country losing sleep over the Y2K situation. I bought the book after hearing the author on The Kevin and Bean show, read it, and became more fearful of what might happen. The author capitolized on fear and won. He got my money. I would not purchase a book from this author again. Looks like my book will be a good firestater."
2,Totaly unrealistic.,"For the past 17 months I have been doing reasearch on Y2k, and now I know that this book is lulling people into a false sense of security. I know this sounds like I'm a prophet of Gloom and doom, but there is far more evedence that y2k will last up to 6 years before the reconstruction can begin. I suggest you get ""What Will Become of Us"" by Julian Gregori, as it is more realistic."
4,A real eye-opener.,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book should be translated into German. Germany and the rest of the EU countries have been focusing on the Euro conversion, and Y2K awareness is just starting. The Euro target date could be postponed by politicians, Y2K can't."
4,"Great on ""Why it will happen""; weak on ""What to do about it""","This is the perfect book to buy for your wife or mother-in-law if they think you are a kook. And, it's the perfect book for YOU to buy if you aren't sure if Y2K is real. But, the book has a very limited amount of information regarding what to do about the problem. The focus is primarily on why the Y2K thing will happen and what conditions will result from it. If you or anyone needs to know if Y2K is real, then BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,BoxWave Capacitive Amazon Kindle Fire Stylus - Works for All Kindle...,"my daughter used it for couple days and the rubber ripped off. now, we cant used these stylus anymore. I paid for nothing! I would not recommend your product."
5,Smooth Operator,I have no clue why I agonized over purchasing a stylus for my Kindle Fire when BoxWave had this all along! Good if you have hands a bit on the large side (I do) and glides smoothly over the surface of my Fire. A great price combined with Amazon's super fast shipping and you have a winner all the way around!
2,Who cares?,"Clearly I'm in the minority here, but I did not enjoy this book at all. Part 1 just did not ring true to me. First, I found the characters to be completely one-dimensional. Miranda reads like a female character written by a man. And Hugh -- handsome, philosophical, patient and willing to leave his wife! -- read to me like a man's idea of a woman's idea of the ideal man! Second, I had no idea where the book was headed and frankly, didn't much care.Then, Part 2, the weird stuff kicks in. I didn't care about the characters in the first place, so I didn't much care what happened to them or why. I had literally no interest in deciphering the events/visions/ghosts."
1,Bizarre,"I wanted to like this book. The reviews were mostly very good and it sounded like a very intriguing read....intriguing is not the word for it. I have to disagree with other reviewers as I found it one of the most bizarre reads ever - and really, a waste of time. Maybe science fiction fans would enjoy it more. I am a huge fan of thrillers, crime drama, mysteries and the like - this is none of those. I find Dean Koontz a fascinating writer and he definitely does not fall into a specific genre but does write some way out there stuff - even being a fan of his often ""suspension of disbelief"" writing, I was NOT a fan of this book or writer. I won't be able to bring myself to try anything else by Carroll. I did NOT care about these characters, the plot was at best bizarre and I did have to force myself to finish. Not my cup of tea for sure."
2,The Marriage of Sticks,"I didn't care for the book because a good majority of it was back and forth between present day and past and was confusing. Other authors have a better way of distinguishing different time periods. Also, I felt that the main character made a few poor decisions in her lifetime, but paid for them too drasticly. The end of the book made me feel very sad."
1,A pretty bad book,"I do a fair amount of reading but usually don't end up writing a review. Just (10 minutes back) finished reading this book and it was - just bad - so much so that I decided to write this review. Basic and absurd storyline - badly developed lead characters, and an implausible bad guy for shock value. Will Monroe Jr. going from being in the right place at the right time all the time in the beginning to being in wrong places at the wrong time consistently. Everything happens in NY for lack of imagination. Search for 36 people among 6 Billion and 3 are in NY. Save your time and pass this one."
1,Disappointment,"This book is an attractive little book with a photo of each salad by the recipe. Unfortunately, the recipes call for poor quality ingredients and sacrifices taste for convenience. This cookbook is better suited to a dorm room than a kitchen.Many of the recipes use a bottled dressing with the addition of an ingredient or two to make a unique dressing. For example, Italian dressing with soy sauce and toasted sesame oil is an Asian dressing and non-fat pineapple yogurt and curry powder is a tropical dressing. Much better, fresher dressings could be whipped up in only a couple of minutes from scratch.Non-fat Italian dressing, packaged greens, and packaged coleslaw mix are probably the most commonly used ingredients in the book. The last third of the book is pasta, rice, and legume salads."
1,strongman,"One of the most depressing, sad books I have ever read. Hepburn was to be admired for his feats of strength,but saddened at his personal life. He was waiting for someone or something to either show him what to do with his life,or actually provide for him. What a waste."
5,It's STILL hard to be hip over thirty,"This book of poetry/short stories made me laugh. Hearing about other people's married life, in laws, etc. is just as funny as telling about my own. I was sad to realize that women have the same problems now as they did in 1970. Not knowing what this book was about when I bought it I was hoping for answers, but fortunately I got a laugh at least. Quite amusing for people interested in women's studies as well."
1,Where is my book ?,I am still waiting for my book.I bought on April 3th and nothing ! Very bad customer service. Never again !
5,good book,The book was well writen and fast moving. The author draws you in from the first few pages of the book.
5,Kracken's The Angel Within,"I absolutely love this original work of fiction. It's a dazzling tale of angst and pain and the ability to over come it all. Sunnie is a delightful character that is very realistic and I can't help but feel sorry for him throughout the story. Jhai's compasssion helps Sunnie see there is more to life than abuse and his love for Sunnie shines through and makes Sunnie see how beautiful he really is. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a story that has no bounds when love and friendship teach life lessons and teach us to accept what we truly are."
1,"One Down, Two to go",I did not like this film it was boring and not original. Who ever filmed it also filmed it to dark so it is hard to watch. But you may want to watch it for your self.
3,They have been consistently better.,"If you are a fan of VNV Nation from the days of Praise the Fallen and Empires then about half of the tracks on this album are for you. However the other tracks are experiments in a trend that they have been following since Futureperfect. I am still not sure how I feel about this. I enjoy electronic music, but I feel that there is something amiss with Futureperfect and Matter + Form. All the same, I would have to say that for the die-hard VNV fan this will definitely be a good addition to your collection.For more reviews and information please see [...]"
3,Not groundbreaking but still a solid VNV Nation album,"Mixing thumping beats,slightly preachy lyrics and some gorgously soft songs this is a satisfying release even if this group has done this all before.There's nothing as soaringly brillant as Futureperfect's Beloved but Track 6 Nemesis is a terrific catchy song and Track 5 Momentum is perfect for a strobelit dance floor.The final tracks on the album on the soft side,track 8 the achingly beautiful Illusion is as good as or better than Snow Patrol's Chasing Cars.The only reason I didn't give it a 4 or a 5 is because there are no surprises here,VNV Nation hasn't really evolved enough for this to be a crossover hit but if you're a fan of synthpop/industrial music this album gets the job done."
2,Disappointing and preachy,I found this album to get a bit grating. A few of the songs are so dull and preachy that they approach self-parody. A few songs such as The Farthest Star keep it from being a total loss.
2,Caveat Emptor! beware all HP computers!,"Several years ago, HP decided to deprive their customers of Windows recovery CDs. Instead, HP puts recovery information in a hidden partition on YOUR hard drive, thus decreasing its capacity. If you have to use this information to recover from a serious system problem, the process will restore the computer to its original condition. This means that all of the software and data files that you have added will be removed and all of the space-hogging software that HP provides (and which you probably removed to attempt to recover some hard disk space) will be restored.HP claims to have stopped providing recovery CDs because of its contract with Microsoft. Translation: they saved money at your expense. Avoid all HP computers!!!!!"
5,High praise for Roach!,"In short: Roach's presentation here is insightful, informative and still quite entertaining.In not so short: I have found that when reading a book rooted in academia, meaning rich with research and depth, it is not often a fun read. Not the case here, the reader gains tremendous insight about the culture of sex work, yet you are almost always entertained. Roach is candid in her experiences and thoughts throughout her research and process. If the book seems interesting to you, you will not be disappointed."
3,Preview in person,"To be certain there are some invaluable hints in this book. But since the items covered are just spots of information from here and there around the landscape of web and design standards you need to check this book out in person to make sure you are getting your moneys worth. In particular I liked the material on CSS layout, but I was disappointed with coverage of basic topics like web safe colors, which requires a more in-depth discussion than the few paragraphs presented. Worth the look, but be sure to look before you buy."
1,DEEPLY disturbing,"I found this book in the church library, and PROMPTLY had it removed. Not a Catholic text by any means. Sexist,awful, nasty and disturbing.This book preaches sexual ""purity""....but is written by a man who did not even KISS his wife until after engagement, and is compulsive masturbater and ""pornography addict"".This book says to find a man who will have ultimate control over your life. This book does not show you how to find a ""great guy""...who respects you as a member of Christ's body, sees you as a partner...an equal...If you want an abusive, sexually backward, unhealthy relationship...this is an excellent guide."
4,Starting Triking Freedom to Fly Ultralight Powered Hang Gliders,"This is a good DVD for someone (like me) who really knows nothing about ""triking."" It gives you (as advertised) an introduction to what ultralight triking is all about. There are many different instructorsinterviewed, which I think would help you to figure out what you would want in a qualified teachers. It looks like a lot of fun, but i'm afraid of heights. One of the instructors explained how he made sure the student had time ""to get used to"" the feeling of flying and height, etc. before anything else was attempted. That seems very sensible to me. I found it relaxing to watch."
5,The Bible of Fine Men's Dress,"I have read this book several times with pleasure and refer to it often. (I even reached for it on my wedding day for advice on pocket squares.) Flusser combines detailed information about fabrics, tailoring, and color with his own wonderful sense of style, based on 1930s and '40s models that have remained classic. A beautiful book and well worth the price."
2,The Bronte Collection,"I am an avid fan of the three Bronte sisters' works, and was very excited to finally get an audio collection of some of their best-known works: Jane Eyre; Wuthering Heights; The Tenant of Wildfell Hall; and Villette. Even though the presentation is alright, these audio books are extremely abbreviated versions of the originals. This, in my way of thinking, is very sad, and constitutes a poor product. These master pieces should never be abbreviated or shortened or changed. Only an unabridged version is really worth listening to. Sorry, but this product does not live up to standard."
5,Good for SAR and all kinds of things,"They fit my big mitts just fine. I carry them in all my med. kits and use them around the house when I want to keep my hands clean...painting or working or greasy things or whatever. I'll probably buy latex free next time, but this are fine gloves."
1,Strange Love of Martha Ivers,"I bought this because Barbara Stanwyck is in it and I thought it would be good. However, it seems to be a poor duplication of Double Indemnity. The story wasn't the same but there were a lot of similarities. The movie wasn't very good and it was very disappointing as I expected much better."
1,the strange love of martha ivers,this dvd was so washed out-the brightness turned up so far it was unwatchable. l should have asked for a refund or credit at the time but too late now.
3,Melodrama,"Stanwyck parraine Douglas dans ce film très old-class, plus mélodramatique que noir. Pas très original, mais les acteurs sont convaincants. Pourquoi s'en priver?"
5,Great Cheese Tray or Serving Platter,"I love this product! I receive multiple positive comments from others that see it. I liked mine so much, I've bought a few as gifts. I use it for cheese, meats and vegetables. Once you get it, you will find endless ways for it's use.I also purchased the dust free chalk to write on the board, but prefer the cheese markers, instead. It has great presentation and is easy to clean.They all arrived from the shipping company packed safely. I have had no issues with chipping. The back has one large piece of felt to keep it from scratching my granite countertops or table tops."
5,"Wonderful, Soulful Book","I purchased this book as a gift to one lovely and dear lady to spend her final hours of life with, reviewing pictures of goldens like her own, as she was captive in a hospital bed until the end.... I pray it brought her some final joy in her life during which she so adored dogs...."
3,"Papa Roach's ""New"" Sound","It's always hard to make a good follow up to a debut. For a band like Papa Roach this is in no way an exception. Their debut ""Infest""wasn't the best of records I have heard with their rock-rap formulas and alternative sound. Now that they have released ""Lovehatetragedy"" they're trying a new sound of less rap and more rock. But is this new sound really any better? Not at all. A lot of songs sound the same as Infest, just without the rapping. Many sound very commercial and for the MTV crowd. She Loves Me Not is a great single but the majority of record itself is plain boring. Skip this and try something like Korn or Godsmack."
2,What happened?,"Could they not think of any lyrics because four of their songs are nothing but repeating the same chrous over and over and over again and they're not even that good of a quote either. Other than ""She Loves Me Not"" which is a great single the CD lacks what Papa Roach once was. I loved these guys and I was really excepting something huge but the songs are repetitive and lack the diversity that Papa Roach had on their first album. The first album they were all over. Each song had it's own flavor and flare completely different from the last. I'm very disappointed and I would suggest DL most of the songs before you buy the album otherwise you'll get ripped."
5,En todos lados se coecen habas,"Es un libro muy realista en cuanto al manejo de comida en cualquier parte del mundo, parte del problema que se escribe en el libro y por supuesto queda en el aire, es que hacer para que dicho manejo sea más higiénico y menos burócrata, cosa que es casi imposible en nuestra época, a lo mejor más adelante alguien hará algo para mejorar la calidad de los alimentos y sus establecimientos, la duda sigue estando en el aire."
