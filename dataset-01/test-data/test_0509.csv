4,The Nanny,"Jo Green is tired of village life, living with her parents, her boyfriend, and hanging out at the local pub. She takes a nannying job in London with a dysfunctional yet fun family and her life is turned upside down as she discovers her true self and her true interests.The Nanny is a light satisfying read. The plot is fairly predictable but the book is quick to read, humorous, and touching. Recommended as a great vacation book!"
2,Not even decent Chick-lit,"""The Nanny"" by Melissa Nathan looks like something special, but inside it is filled with flat characters, which the reader is able to guess the outcome. You just know by the end of the first chapter that Jo, our titled Nanny, is going to used by her new employers and boyfriend that seem a little to good to be true. and by the end the reader gets just thatn""The Nanny is a fine example of bad Chick-lit."
3,"Nice , a little out of ordinary","In comparison to the Nanny Diaries, this is way better. Perhaps it enlightens us on a job many look down upon ( perhaps maybe no thanks to fran drescher ). It is funny, heartwarming and a good book to read again and again. However, like all chic-lit, the guy ( Josh Fitzgerald ) is too damn nice. And the girl is always the blur mistaken one. But its nice and damn well worth a read."
5,Best Single Reference for non-Physicians,"This is a very comprehensive survey, written in a wonderfully accomplished prose style that is suitable both for adults and literate youths. Highly recommended."
3,Good Book,"Great book! Loved the pictures, the story line and the martian language even was able to be decoded! Super fun for both my 3 year old and my 5 year old!"
5,"Hands Down, Bare Foot Boy is a Classic","A lesser-known but essential fusion record. Few have touched the energy of jazz-rock cosmic explorations more than Larry Coryell during his alcohol fueled mid-70s heyday. In the spirit of Mahavishnu Orchestra's ""Inner Mounting Flame"" or Return To Forever's ""Light as a Feather"", ""Barefoot Boy "" thrusts the listener into a organic ebb and tide of electric explosion and jazz introspection. Backed by the solid and funky rhythm section of drummer Roy Haynes, bassist Mervin Bronson, Coryell and soprano sax player Steve Marcus trade scorching sequences of notes.The album's first track, ""Gypsy Queen"", is a cosmic spin-off of Gabor Szabo's composition. ""The Great Escape"" is rooted in deep funk and an unorthodox rhythm pattern. Timed at just long that 20 minutes, ""Call to Higher Consciouness"" exposes the band's dynamism. The melodic slow burning track lives up it's name. Barefoot Boy is essential for any complete jazz fusion or guitar hero collection."
4,Worth the money...,"This is the first tenon cutter I ever purchased, and I must say that after I figured out how to use it, it works perfect. The key is to get the diameter of the log smaller than outside diameter of the cutter (~3 1/2""). For doing a couple of jobs here and there it's worth the money. I do not do this for a living, so hopefully this cutter will last my lifetime."
5,State of Punk 2004,"Great state of the union for Punk in 2004, the Murphys and Ducky Boys to Rancid and Lars Fredrickson...play it loud, share with friends (and enemies)!"
4,I'm reminded of the freedom and joy of childhood,"When I read this book, I was transported back to those free and wonderful feelings of childhood. I chuckled out loud at the memories and my day to day worries melted away with the abandonment of being a kid. A good read for a good reminder of the joy of childhood."
4,Good picture book with beautiful illustrations,"A sweet story with beautiful illustrations. The text is straightforward and engaging, if not brilliant. The illustrations definitely raise the whole book up a notch. The facial expressions are wonderful (poor ones in picture books are a pet peeve of mine!). If your child or classroom or Sunday school class or scout troop or whatever is participating in a Heifer International drive, I highly recommend this book as an introduction to young children.(Note: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher at an American Library Association Annual Conference. I was not required to write a positive review. Thank you, Simon & Schuster!)"
2,Unnecessary.,"Even Tho I am a big, big Boz Scaggs fan, I have to say this collection is a waste of money. It's the repetition of the Original Hits! compilation, released in 1980, without ""You Can Have Me Anytime"" and adding ""Heart Of Mine"" and ""Hard Times."" Boz deserves better and no wonder he left Sony music if they're gonna treat his material this way. Go for the masterpieces: ""My Time: Anthology 1969-1997,"" and his albums ""Silk Degrees,"" ""Slow Dancer"" and, of course, his debut album. Collections like this one are just filler."
3,Pricey and awkward,"Purchased for my D700. Lifetime Nikon user. Two things I wish Nikon would address for this price: 1) either a snap-on or screw-on protector for the ten prong inserter to keep dust or other foreign matter away when it's stored in camera bag or pocket when on the move or shooting, now use a small ziplock bag; 2) a larger inserter knob for fingers to grasp when screwing or unscrewing from camera. It's a challenge now in low light when fast response needed for quick movement."
2,Buy an alternative for $9.00,"I bought an alternative Chinese-made brand on a popular auction site for $9. It does the same thing and is flawless on my D300. I do not see the purpose of paying $50 more for a piece of plastic that triggers a shutter. While I am willing to pay for quality products when necessary (hence, the D300), I don't see the need for a Nikon branded product in this case."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Party boys and politics.Arutha's sons are your typical rich brats, drinking, gambling, skirtchasing, etc. So, a bit peeved with them, they get packed off to a boring political function/celebration in Kesh.It ends up anything but boring, as it seems them being dead suits some of the locals, and they get caught up in a serious civil conflict, and have to get help and try and survive."
2,A big disappointment,"Feist can normally be relied on to provide and exciting, consistent, well characterised and well painted image of his world.Prince of the Blood seriously disappoints by Feist's high standards.Skip this and get straight onto the Serpentwar saga if it isn't too late for you already."
4,"Better than a dozen lesser novels, but not Feist's best.","Raymond E. Feist is certainly, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best authors in existence. So it was with great expectation that I approached this book. It is far from his greatest book, but certainly worth a look if you enjoyed his other work. The story works well enough, as does the setting, but I didn't find the charcters compelling enough to warrant a five-star review. However, it is neccessary that you read this one, as it provides background on certain characters who appear in Feist's later novels, most notably Nakor the Isalani. So, if you're looking for an enjoyable read, I would recommend this one, but read the Riftwar Saga first. Magician is probably the greatest book I've ever read..."
4,This book is woth reading,"Well, this is certainly a better book than others that came later, but its not quite as good as Magician, Darkness at Sethanon, and Silverthorn. The most annoying thing I found about Mr. Feist is that he reuses names for new characters. Erland and Boric are the names of the former prince of krondor and the former duke of Crydee. This can be confusing. I have seen this happen in Shards of a broken crown as well, with James.I would recommend this book to you, although anything past this would be not worth your time. The first four books written by this author are worth reading, but the others are not."
5,An educational and entertaining book,This book is a great peak in to some aspects of the BDSM world of one Mistress. It shows her journey in a way that most books miss. I trully enjoyed it on several levels.
1,If I could give this book a zero I would,Has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. What else is there to say.
3,"disturbing, depressing","I found America to be a very disturbing book as it presented a glum view of social services available to children in care. (Admittedly I am naive about such matters.) However, as a middle school librarian, I know that there is a huge market for this type of book and kids will flock to read it. SO, if you don't like to read, or if you need to read interesting and unusual novels, then this would be the one for you. Frank is excellent at getting the reader involved in America's story, and he is someone the reader really wants to succeed."
5,KLO-Idaho,"Totally amazing story. A good ""history"" lesson on WW II in the Pacific and the Japanese mentality."
5,Amazing book in every aspect.,"The book is amazingly written, researched, and outstanding in every way. It is worth every penny. It's a solid and long read but very readable!"
4,I was a radioman on DE 415m the Lawrence Taylor,I am still in the process of reading--too many books at a time for an old World War II guy :-)
4,Never new this history.,"I never knew about this major WW II naval until I read the book. And, I thought I knew about the Pacific naval battles. As an engineer, I like the technical details about the ships and how the operate. There are just enough technical details to keep your interest without being boring. Good read about a battle that ""saved"" the Pacific Fleet. Even after reading the book, one still wonders how the Tin Cans and Jeep Carriers withstood the Jap battleships. Every one of Sailors and Pilots who took part in the Battle should have gotten a Navy Cross."
5,I cried,There's nothing i can say that hasn't already been said about this book. All I can say it is a must read ! I cried when I thought of all those brave Sailors lost in the battle. James Hornfischer brings the battle to you.
5,Exciting Story of WWII in the Pacific,"This book really tells me about the value of good intelligence during a military operation. This tells the tale of the soldiers and sailors on board the ships in the action in the South Pacific when America took action to reclaim the Phillippines from the Japanese Empire.Both sides of this battle suffered from poor information and lost many good men as a result.I have good knowledge of the World War II action in Europe, but this book opens the story of the war in the Pacific to me. It is truly an ""edge of your seat"" story."
2,Film school presentation in glorious setting,"This film was quite a disappointment to me. From the very beginning, it was clear that the photography was going to be clunky and amateurish, and it was. The sound was OK, and fortunately the subtitles were very good. The story was of the rambling variety - I could have gladly edited out 20 minutes of the film. To its credit, the DVD has a Making Of Commentary, which helps pinpoint the beautiful region of Spain where the film was shot.The main story was interesting enough - and the 13 year old boy, Pablo, was a sympathetic character. The tension created between him and Paco, ""the stranger with a past"" was quite interesting, but the film's climax bordered on the ludicrous.This film would have been a success on Argentinian or Mexican television, but I can't recommend it here. Sorry, but I have to pull the ladder on this one."
3,I wasn't as impressed by this Liz Phair album...,"Well, it's definately Liz Phair here again, but she seems to have lost her flare for capturing our, or at least my, attention. This album is still good, more mellow, and well, overall...just not one of my favorites. I would recommend her former releases before this one."
4,Can't stop listening to it,"I didn't quite like the her last album (been a fan since Guyville) but I totally love most of the songs on this album. My favorite is Wind and the Mountain, Why I Lie, Leap of Innocence and Table for One. Got My Own Thing is a clever and witty song typical of Liz Phair. Well just wanted to say it's nice to see Liz leaning more to her old style then what she did on the self-titled. It's not on par with EIG but it holds its own."
1,Closer To Nothing,"I saw someone asking about the song ""Can't Get Out of What I'm Into"" not being on the album. They cut it out because Wal-Mart said they wouldn't put it on there shelfs. And we all know that wouldn't be good. She blamed the fact that her last album was a bomb because Wal-Mart didn't carry it (not even the edited cut) and forced her to go on tour playing as she referred to as 'Armpit cities like Memphis, Dallas, Kansas City.' Oh, poor thing! On the bright-side she'll always have her multimillionaire daddy to buy her a six and a half million dollar beach home in California. The song ""Closer to You"" is the replacement for ""Can't Get Out of What I'm Into."" And that's good because it's extremely plain and sounds like everything else on the extremely flat album. On her new take of ""Can't Get Out of What I'm Into"" she says, 'Two more years and I'll go back to school.' That might not be such a bad idea. I'm sure you could learn some music theory."
3,Where is the spark?,"While this newest effort from Liz Phair is not unpleasant to listen to, it is a very predictable, frequently cliche pop music. The energy that permeated her self-titled CD is just nowhere to be found here."
2,Where did Liz Phair go?,"I cannot tell you how shocked I am so listen to Liz Phair's new cd. Is this what she is trying to do, shocking us by taking this direction? ""Why I lie,"" and ""Got my own thing"" are the only two songs that sound like a Liz song. I can actually listen to this cd with my kids in the room. Not to say that is bad, but after listening to Disney Princess 1000 times, I need something different.....not with this cd. Very Very Boring!"
1,C'mon Liz...seriously? Part II,"She can't sing. At least when she was an indie chick she had the word ""alternative"" to excuse her from needing to sound any good. The commercial experiment, which consists of ""Liz Phair"" and ""Somebody's Miracle,"" was a huge failure artistically and commercially. Sad but true."
3,"Interesting setting, but poor on system","Other reviewers have already commented on how the introduction will suck you in, so I can't agree more. The big problem I have with the game is the fact that it is based on d20 :( and the poor artwork that sneaks into some sections. The layout is great, the setting is powerful, but I find myself converting to a more preferable system, and researching my own technology, without Mechs. The game would have been far better had it been a rewrite of Twilight:2000 instead of Mechwarrior.In short, buy the books, cut out the Mechs, and use the setting with the game system of your choice."
4,"Looks sharp, feels solid","The luminous hands are pretty clear after a day in the sun. No magnifier over the date, but I prefer that. The band was a little large, but getting it resized was not a problem."
5,"SSpring, MD",Listened to the CD for the first time on Monday. FANTASTIC. I have been playing it ever since.
3,Better products than this out there,"Bought this for the bedroom, the steel casing outer ring which gives it the look has got dirt all over it which I couldn't clean with water. Will be trying chemicals now.I have got this to India (and there is no Indian city as World Time). So I am basically stuck with London and London.It looks decent, but definitely not worth the money I bought it for, better clocks are available for same price."
4,Dollar store star,"Every once in awhile I'll go into an Indian-owned Dollar store and buy a few of their $1 CDs off the rack. Well, of all CDs I bought, this is the only one that wasn't chucked out of the window on the way back from the store.Mike G definately has something going here. Catchy and has the lo-fi feeling that many bands try to achieve. This one sounds like it was recorded in his bedroom.Its a cd that distinctly has an indie feel, a REAL indie feel. Its a great ad dition to my collection of good music out there..."
3,Beautiful watch if it were in the color shown,"I first noticed this watch in Sears for about $225 and thought, what a nice watch. It was elegant but not too, so it could still be worn everyday. It has a slim look to it and the fact that it has no battery to replace is great. (They say that once a seal is broken for a battery replacement often the watch stops working soon after because of moisture getting in there.) Unfortunately, Amazon sent this watch to me with a navy blue face instead and it no longer has that elegant look about it. I could have picked up the Navy blue one in Costco for $[...] but preferred the light green instead so I ordered it here. Since it was a gift that I needed imediately there was no time to return it. If you order from here I would definitely put a notation down when ordering it what the color of the face should be."
3,Got it for my Father!!,"Awesome service from the seller! The item arrived in good condition and before the time scheduled for delivery.Got this one for my father. There a couple of songs from this artist that I like, sadly they are not included in this collection. But if you ask my father, he will tell you to buy it!"
5,Wife loves them,My wife really loves these scissors. They are always sharp and they really make her feel special when she uses them (it is the gold!!!)
5,sony adapter,i love this adapter. i use it everyday at work. it saves me a lot of money for not buying batteries.
2,The Problem with Popular History,"Brands tells a familiar story with competence and sometimes skill. But he ignores 20 years of new scholarship on early Texas, choosing instead to tell the myths one more time. Especially troubling is his handling of slavery in early Texas history--he ignores it almost completely. Texas rebeled against Mexico in large part because the Mexicans were determined to stamp out slavery in their northern province. The Texans at the Alamo were not the good guys.[Edit: I can't believe some of the reviews of this book. Does no one feel that slavery is a big thing to leave out of Texas history?]"
2,Ummm....,"This ones good for the MTV trance people. You know who im talking about...the ones that still have Sandstorm playing in their CD player. If you really like, and listen to trance, avoid this album."
2,So so,"I can't say that this is ATB's most stellar work. He's a great DJ, don't get me wrong, but the song choice for this CD isn't the best I've heard. It is also on the cheesy side of techno, which ATB tends to go for. If you like cheesy techno add another star to my review and go listen to it. Otherwise save your money."
5,one man's journey to a vibrant jewish self,"Alan Morinis is pioneering the rediscovery of the Jewish practice of Mussar, whichmay be thought of as the personal growth practices branch of Judaism. In this book, he recountshis experience with Rabbi Perr, a modern day Mussar teacher, who embodies the quest forawareness, accountability, realness, unflinching honesty, and lovingkindness that one embraceson the path of mUssar. THe book is touching, deeply engaging, and also useful and informativefor one's own practice. Highly recommended!"
5,A joyful book! A must for every dog lover.,This book is both funny and touching. It gives us a look behind the curtain into the complex mind of man's best friend. The artwork is fresh and enlivening. Our whole family loves this book. We keep it on our coffee table and look at it when ever we need a chuckle.
5,30 for 30 review,"Great stories, interesting behind the scenes informationEnjoyed the commentary and the completely different sports and the people involvedGreat"
1,Fell apart,I have had Electrolux vacuum for about three years and have went through about five filters. This one fell apart after a few uses. First the cover came off and there was no way to reattach it. Then the whole thing continued to fall apart after that. I had to hold it on by tape to finish out the job of vacuuming. Will not buy this product again. Not sure if it was just a 'lemon' that I received or if they are all this way. But I will try to buy name-brand from now on.
1,BORING!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS BAD BAD BAD!, the love scenes are boring. the girls are ugly and the music got on my freaking nerves. I dont know if they were trying to be this bad cause they thought it was funny, or if the filmmaker just really is that bad. Horrible, dont waste your time."
3,Deanna Bogart,This girl can rock just fine. Like most of the tunes. The band cooks and shes a good front person
5,From leftovers to lunch !,"This is a GREAT size for single serve leftovers that travel well to be tomorrows microwavable lunch ! The dish is heavy weight glass and has a tight fitting, vented, flexible plastic lid. Great product ! Highly recommend !"
5,Ullman is a flat out genius.,"This autobiographical show is yet another manifestation of the quirky genius that is Tracey Ullman. Certainly, if you're **not** curious about Ullman as a person or interested in how she came to do what she does and how her characters were developed, then don't buy the DVD (reviewers who were disappointed on this score should give themselves a single star for failing to read the product description before purchasing). But if you think you'd like to watch Tracey herself tell you her story on stage, with music and dancing and photos and props, in a very funny and wryly detached sort of way, then Add to Cart while you still can. It's a highly unique turn by a very gifted person."
4,An Easy Read,This book is easy to read. Takes a couple of hours. The author does a good job of painting a picture of what life in a team-based organization is like.
2,Don't sweat in your sleep!!!,"I purchased the entire Nautica ""West End"" collection for my teenage sons room. I loved the plush soft feel and the colors were just perfect. How ever, I began to notice the top of the comforter was discolored after about 6 months. So I washed it, again..no change. So I flipped the top to the bottom..within several months the same thing happened. I can only attribute it to perspiration interacting with the dye. I have NEVER, EVER had this happen to any other comforter I have purchased for my children!! Any way, now I have to either spend $ 130.00 for the duvet cover and hope it doesn't discolor or change out his entire set. Just an FYI....I did not contact either the store or Nautica about this problem. I could not find my receipt and I had purchased the items to the set from various stores."
4,"Dibujos regulares, historia buena pero corta","Los dibujos no estuvieron a lo que nos acostumbra Marvel, por otra parte la historia es buena e interesante pero muy corta... Sería genial una segunda parte con otro dibujante..."
2,Rape or raped,"No film can tell the real sufferings from both sides. The film is biased a priori and doesn't reflect the truth at all.. Historians will judge based on sound data and tell us both the Turks and Greeks about the Island. Many questions: Why UK didn't act as she must have, why massacres done by EOKA to Turks before the invasion is not mentioned? why many common graves are not mentioned?, why Greece didn't stop the Coup D'etateers? And many.. SO Let's stop discussing about the past and see a common beneficial and friendly future to bth nations. Love to all Greeks and Turks who suffered."
5,YES....THIS STORY IS FACT,"I have met Betty Schimmel and her husband Otto. How anyone can say her story is fiction is beyond me. Yes, both Betty and her husband Otto survived the concentration camps. The deep emotions of her story are still evident in her voice and face. This is a true life story about both the horrors of war and being a Jew in WWII Europe and of true love.True, this is not an ending to give away. Read Betty's story. It will rip your heart in many directions. You will not be disappointed. You will not be able to put this book down."
3,Looks like it came from A VHS copy,This is a cool little video and the first person perspective makes you feel like you were there. However the picture quality looks like something from a vhs copy. Pretty good dvd altogether. recommended.
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this DVD because of it's features listed in the technical information sheet. As a Home Theater Salesman in Australia, good dts software is hard to come by, but very necessary. Non-violent, but yet exciting dts scenes that can be demonstrated to the average family are hard to find, especially ones with dramatic flucuations in dynamics etc. This DVD promised everything; dts; multi angle; interactive menus, etc. While the multi angle feature on this title is excellent for demo, the soundtrack itself is hopeless. The dominant sound is music in dts, and not rollercoaster sound effects as I had hoped. I'm hoping that if a second disc is made, there is an option to remove the music in the sound option menu."
2,"Very Pretty, Not practical!","I just got this item in the mail last week, and it already had a stress crack by the handle! The crack seeps, I was really disappointed...usually I am all about EVERYTHING that Target sells, but this time I was a little bummed! It will now go on top of my kitchen cabinets with some pretty silk flowers or something...because I do think it is very pretty. (PS~ I was even really careful with it because I wanted to preserve it's look.)"
4,Not quite what I remembered,"I was young the first time I saw this film. I remembered it being much more funny, but it was still good. I consider this a must-own for comedy martial arts enthusiasts. The stunts in this film are a bit shocking, considering they were done with people instead of CGI. I doubt you will be disappointed with this film (assuming you like the genre to begin with)."
1,What a crude and awful movie,So completely crude I could not watch it through. Despicable characters. I really could not stomach this movie. Just one nasty scene after the next. The only person you feel for is the poor little kid. Didn't find it funny in the least.
5,First class recording of the Septet,"Lovely balance, intonation, tempi and interpretation. Used for preparation of a live performance of the piece.The Septet is possibly Beethoven's best early (Op. 20) small ensemble piece."
4,Shining star dragon,My daughter loves her dragona dn it goes EVERYWHERE she does and so far ive washed it 4 times and its looked as new each time. Very durable toy- She even throws him around quite a bit
2,Disappointing ...,"I was really eacited to read this, but severely let down.At first it is somewhat intriguing, different, alittle edgy, strange, but quickly transitions into pretty much unreadable, really random, and not making any sense - as opposed to surreal, which was what I had interpreted from reviews, and was therefore hoping for.Bleh."
1,Men's Yoga with a woman on the cover?,I think the title of my review says my opinion ( of the cover at least). No I haven't seen the dvd.
2,"Response not Summary, time limited","The plotline seems...interesting from the book flap, but Cabot writes the plotline as cheesy.There wasn't depth to the characters and their motives, which in result, made them 2D and uninteresting.Sure, it's valerous and has a theme to coincide hand-in-hand with the Sept. 11 attack, and there is the VERY CUTE President's son, but this publishing by Cabot leaned on the cliche side.There's nothing wrong with borrowing the book from the library, just don't buy it.This isn't one of those books that will make you feel satisfied of buying-before-reading."
3,A days worth of fluff,"This book is teenage girl fluff. I whizzed through the whole thing in a day. While David is every bit as adorable and wonderful as Michael for the Princess Diaries, I found that I didn't enjoy the heroine, Sam, nearly as much as I like Mia. The plot is just plain goofy, and follows the exact same line as the Princess Diaries. Still, it's a fun, brainless read of instant fame, makeoevers, cheerleader bashing, first kisses, and cute boys. Don't expect much more though."
5,you've just got to have this,"all american girl is samantha madison; she's 15, feels she's an outsider, left-handed, dresses in black all the time, great at drawing, likes no doubt, always being made fun of kris parks, in love with her big sister's boyfriend...and she just saves the president's life!! suddenly her world turns upside down: she's no longer an outsider--in fact, she's become the most popular girl in country, and she gets to be teen ambassador to UN. Oh, and the president's son, david, just might be in love with her...i give this book 5 stars, mainly because the writing is so convincing, it makes you believe that all the things really do happen. and even though it's long (400 pages) i've finished it in 1 day, because it's so hard to get boring, the story just flows. the last part--where lucy dumps her boyfriend, jack, because ""according to lucy, she loved me (sam) more than she could love any guy)--is pretty surprising, and touching, too. overall, i would recommend this book to any girl."
2,yech,"To be blunt, reading this book was NOT a pleasurable experience. I felt like I was being continually whacked over the head with the Plot Exposition Shovel. I don't remember the authors I used to read as a teen like Norma Klein, Judy Blume and Paula Danziger being so blatantly moralistic and repetitive. ""Draw what you see"" ok, we get it; we only need it mentioned twice at most.Secondly, David seemed to act more like Sam's big brother than her love interest.Third, knowing what bands a character likes/wears does not mean you are off the hook when it comes to developing their personalities.Fourth, it seemed like Catherine (best friend) just suddenly became confident and socially adept overnight. What was up with that?Fifth, I can't see the President of the United States kowtowing to a teenage girl that easily, as he did with the choice of painting in the art contest. Doesn't he deal with tougher adversaries as leader of the free world?But I liked the book's dedication."
4,Great but Not Flawless...4 1/2 stars,"Great book! Written through the eyes of Samantha Madison, who is stuck in the middle of two 'perfect' sisters and wears all black, this book has it all- feelings, top ten lists, etc. Parents might object, my mom did at first. But still worth it.While ditching art class because she can already draw, she saves the president's life. She becomes his son's girlfriend. She learns a lot about life in this funny novel. I read it too young. 10 yrs. to 14 yrs."
5,Wow....,Amazing breathtaking coolio funny fun totally not a waste of time good book totally awesome cool did I say that?
5,Purely enjoyable,"I'm a huge Princess Diaries fan, and found this book just as enjoyable and a good read while waiting for the next Princess Diaries book. The author writes - as always - with wit and a style that makes her seem like a real teenage girl with these problems. All the character were believable and well-developed: from Samantha's old friend who has become (naturally) popular and stuck-up, and her cheerleader sister who keeps trying to mold her into a perfect celebrity. I couldn't put this book down and reccomend it to anyone who likes a good story."
5,Better than Princess Diaries,"This is a fabulous book. For fans of The Princess Diaries, you will love this book. It's clever, funny, and totally universal. I mean, who hasn't had a crush on an older guy that was off-limits? This book is definitely worth your time, trust me."
1,Waste of time and $4,"Worthless piece of ......... We only lasted approx 5-7minutes of watching this ""home movie"" and quit. NOT recommended to anyone"
4,Great Movie,You should definitely watch this movie. It gives you a new respect for people that serve our communities. Really humanizes our public servants.
4,excellent movie,"The handy cam shots were a little annoying but, all in all , it was a very good movie. It felt very realistic."
1,End of Watch,Jake Gyllenhaalj and Michael Peña did a very good job. The script was AWLFUL! The writers used the F bomb as if it was its own form of language. A shame to waste the talents of these actors.
1,"Too much ""F"" word even for me.","I know it was a real life picture of police work in east LA, but after 15 minutes of it, I'd had enough."
4,Webb,Worth watching. Better than average movie. Both of these guys are excellent actors and the film isn't a cheap one
5,One of the best cop movies,I am known to fall asleep during action movies because every other scene is just things exploding or people fighting. But this movie has the right balance of action and drama. You get enough of the characters life stories to care what happens and enough action that it is not boring. It has its funny moments as well. Its just an all around good movie and deserved more attention then it got.
5,Another satisfied VOD from Amazon.,"Myself and family (2 teenage boys) really enjoyed watching this movie, lots of action and just one of those movies that hold your interest till the end."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, there is no point in watching this movie, a complete flop"
4,good flick,"sensitive, keeps your attention and lots of action, sad ending. Makes you appreciate the police and their families sacrifies made"
4,Good cop flick.,"Good entertaining movie. Sheds a light on a mostly thankless job of being a good cop in todays world.I hated the personal camera seens myself like others on here. Would've gave it 5 stars if it had more of a storyline with the bad guys, other than that pretty good."
2,really not very good,This movie wasn't half as good as training day. It's characters were just not compelling. My wife and I were happy when it ended.
4,"Good movie, bad language","Overall I enjoyed this movie. Not the best cop movie I've ever seen, but good nonetheless. I must admit I'm getting rather tired of the whole ""must drop the f bomb every 2nd word"" mentality that movie producers seem to have nowadays. So as I said in the title....good movie, bad language. If you have kids, watch it in another room, long after they go to bed ;)"
5,Great Movie,"Would recommend this movie put in our video library, the filming and acting was done very well. Hits close to home."
4,This movie really hit home!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie was probably the best movie I have ever watched. It depicts actual situations that Law Enforcement Officers face. I have already recommended this movie to several of my friends and coworkers. The only thing I didnt like was the price I had to pay for this movie.
1,Police at its worst,"I have learned not to trust the DVD's jacket after renting this and wasting almost an hour before I ejected it--I found this to be one of the worst movies ever. I thought it was what may have happened if a porn director tried to go legit in movie making -- this would probably be what the end result might be.A terrible waste of time with totally unbelieveable ""actors""."
2,Overrated and Predictable,Lethal weapon meets the blair witch project.. Good performances can't save this unbelievable plot and predictable climax. Skip it and watch something else
2,Tough to watch,"I didn't object to the gritty story or the requisite violence, but I was not happy with the jerky, hand-held cinema verite camera style. The older I get, the more that gives me a headache. Gyllenhaal's performance was adequate, and Michael Pena was excellent. The most objectionable part of the film was the long sequence toward the end that was outrageously unrealistic."
1,"Great, if only I could have seen it","Video would not play, despite being able to actively and seamlessly stream other content. Pay receipt showed cancelled card, despite my having deleted it and added new cards. Contact with Amazon to resolve this is so hopelessly convoluted that it's tempting to just give up and let them keep their crummy 4 bucks."
3,Did not like that the concept was one of the officers was using his camera to film the day to day,I think this would have been an excellent movie if it was filmed as a movie and not through the eye of a camera of one of the officers. Loved the characters and the action was great!
2,NON VIEWER,THIS DVD DID NOT WORK ON MY SONY PLAYER. PROBABLY MY MISTAKE IN NOT CHECKING SMALL PRINT WHEN ORDERING. NEED RETURNS ADDRESS. DO NOT HAVE PRINTER CURRENTLY FOR LABEL.
5,Best cop movie yet!,This definitely exceeded my expectations. I'm surprised this movie is not up for more awards. Gyllenhaal and Peña did an amazing job and definitely deserve awards for their rolls.
2,Illkkkk,"Personally Jake has done better work , This movie is too violent for me and the story line , it portrays them to be crooked and above the law. Perhaps there is violence against police in CA, but this movie was not to my liking . It just doesn't grab ya ."
3,It's like a really good episode of Southland,"The action & acting were good. It's a cop drama & it fits nicely in that category. Is it as good as Training Day ... no. That's why I gave it 3 stars, because I would give Training 4, but I did like this movie & would rate it better than Ok."
4,2 beautiful songs and 1 remix to listen to....,"When I first listened to Britney Spears's cd ""Oops I did it again"", the first song I really liked was ""Lucky""... I think the message given from the song lets many girls realte to it.. even though we aren't these big time movie stars. I think some teenage girls feel ""lucky"" because in many ways they get what they want from their famlies, have great friends and live the life that they want. But I think at night, when your by yourself, you still feel like something is missing.. it might be love or maybe you just don't know. I really liked this song.. and also the other song ""Heart"" featured on this single.. ""Heart"" is a really pretty song.. her voice is beautiful and the back round music is also beautiful. If you buy this single, you'll definatley like it (i know i did)"
5,Another great song by the fabulous Britney Spears!,"I think Britney Spears is the greatest singer of all time and here she did it again with the smash hit, ""Lucky."" This song represents Britney's ability to really touch her audience and yet still remain soulful and edgy at the same time. I think Britney is totally underestimated with her talent. ...I think Britney is great and really should have gotten that Grammy! Well, there's always next year! :) I completely recommend getting this CD single along with all her other CD's! Britney, you rock!"
2,It's NOT cool with me... uh uh.,"Much better than Sorry About Tomorrow, but not better than much else out there... gave it two stars cause I like the first two songs."
2,Legal Dictionary?,"I have a hardbound Black's but got this one to carry with me to class at law school. My advice is to get Black's paperback. I am very disappointed by the frequency with which I have to go to Black's after finding that the Collin dictionary does not have the term I need to find. It has usual terms like orphan, disrespect, and kill, but does not have many terms you'd think you'd find in a legal dictionary. Today it was ""assumpsit"". Who knows what it will be tomorrow."
3,Find the older deck and hardback book,"I first bought just the cards and found them as described ""new"". But they are small, not coated and rather flimsy. I managed to find a used card and hardbound book (Way of the Cartouche) set that other than the packaging, was just like new with larger, coated/laminated cards with a very nice book. It was more expensive but not as much as the prices in just the Cartouche cards catagory. Search around before resorting to paying too much. Do a search on Way of the Cartouche and you may find the larger, nicer cards included with the book and ask the seller about them before buying."
4,Sturdy,I wish the locking mechanism was better as you have to screw it down into the locked position. Besides that the product is good.Looks sturdy and dependable.
2,"After an outstanding first CD, their 2nd CD is a disappointment.","I'm not sure what happened here. deSol's first CD was a ""homerun."" If you wanted to get a party going and get people up on their feet and dancing, you played deSol's first CD. The great lyrics and music from the first CD made it one of my favorite CDs.Perhaps I was expecting too much, but ""On My Way"" was a real disappointment. There are a few good songs, but overall the CD is very lackluster. It's a play it once, forget it CD. It's like a ""b-side"" collection of songs. There are no songs on this CD that I'd upload onto my iPod."
4,Yee Haw!,"Yep, this was a real thrill when it was on the air...just like the way they told the tales. No real fluff and lots of solid facts told in an entertaining way. History buffs will get a kick out of and young kids learning about the Wild West might find it a good source to fall back on when Hollywood is done with it's revisionist west...."
2,Disappointed,I was so disappointed in Drag-On. I was expecting better from him i am one of the biggest Drag-On fans out there and i thought the flame thrower would have done better there are not enough dope joints on this album.
1,drag on and on and on and on and on,"After 79 reviews this cd gets 4 stars that is only a huge misconception of how redundant and lame this is,this man has no charisma,the production is disjointed,lyrically it offers nothing.And the handicap n****s sketch is sick,the only handicap is the thick idiot on the front cover who claims hes a rapper"
2,Drag On rating,"Drag on's ""Opposite of H20"" did not live up to its expectations. The best songs on the cd are #6, #4, and #10. The skits are pointless and the rest of the cd just doesnt hav that spark. some well-known rappers appear on the album such a DMX LOX and eve. I would recommend this only to die hard Ruff ryder fans."
1,HORRIBLE,"i heard spit these bars and die for me and decided to buy the album because i really liked those songs. it was hard for me to listen to it all the way but i kept it might get a little better. this is one of the worst albums ever. the only other good song is here we go with eve(the song would not have been that great if not for her).also the album stayed way over its welcome with 19 songs(including the skits which were stupid yet still painfully long)(when i first looked on the back of the cd i thought there were only nine songs but i didnt see the bottom,just remember that if you buy this horrible album not worth your hard earned money)i must say though spit these bars was a great song along with here we go with eve(die for me was only alright and dmx sounds horrible)without those songs this album would have been -1/5. I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT HIS NEXT ALBUM WILL BE GOOD FOR HE HAS POTENTIAL AND WILL HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AND SMARTER BY THEN"
2,Whats It all about,I mean the song...but the hype no I got this and I dont even play it I like that other song spit these bars but thats it 2 songs 2 stars.
3,"Good to listen to, not a classic","Catchy...that's the best way to describe this joint. It's just really easy to bump, and Drag makes his rhymes interesting enough that you can feel different things after each listen. The Ruff Ryders on this joint help too...Not a classic, and I kind of expected a little more from Drag, but this CD is definitely worth the money. You'll bang this one for a nice long time, and have some songs you'll be hummin' for a while."
5,Drag is HOT!,"when i first herd of drag-on, i didnt like him at all. but when it came out i bought it for some reason, after a while i started to like it. most of the songs are good. this CD is HOT!"
1,Bad,This was one of the worse albums i've ever heard in my life. He's raps about nothing. You need to pick up Canibus's album 2000 B.C. when it comes out and the Big L. The Ruff ryders are one of the worst groups out (execpt the lox) Don't get the drag-on it's horrible.
5,There are no words!,There are no words for what this bible means to me. Growing up my family owned a copy and before bed my mother would read it to us. As an adult I still enjoy it for all the warm memories it brings!
5,True love comes at last,"This is such a fitting conclusion to this wonderful British TV series. All along we have hoped for true love for the vicar and to find it with hunky Richard Armitage, well, wow! The humor is delightfully witty and the slapstick is laugh out loud. This series is so well written! I recommend that you get as many shows as you can find."
5,Funny and Funny,"Our family loves this series. It is very funny, so if you like ""funny,"" this is for you. Great characters."
5,Very good ending,"If you follow the Vicar of Dibley series, this is a very good ending for the series."
5,fantastic finale,"This DVD is a nice finale to a good British comedy series. The ""brother and sister"" characters are a bit too lovey-dovey to be believeable, but Dawn French is at her best."
5,Vicar of Dibley - Happy endings indeed,The last installment of the Vicar's adventures is a little sappy and a little too sweet for such a delightfully sarcastic series but the wit is still high and it is great to see the series end on a high note.Not the best of the series but well worth watching.
1,amazon mislead me,"when i ordered the vicar of dibley immaculate collection there was a note saying that people who ordered it also ordered this, the ""a holy wholly happy ending"" dvd. what amazon didn't write was that this dvd is already included in the collection. when i called to complain, the operator did not understand my problem, and amazon refused to refund my shipping fees because they said it was my mistake. the description of the whole collection did not list the dvds and i believe that i was mislead. the information remains on the website so don't be fooled into thinking you are getting another dvd if you've ordered the collection. the series, however, is terrific and i highly recommend it for any british comedy lover."
2,A disappointing Vicar!,"Being great fans of the Vicar and having now purchased the entire Vicar collection, both my wife and I found this latest episode to bedisappointing at best.We were able to overlook (almost) the load of lard Dawn French had packed on for the previous episode but the distinct lack of first rate writing that characterized the excellence of the series was no longer in evidence here."
5,The Vicar of Dibley - A Holy Wholly Happy Ending,The Vicar of Dibley - A Holy Wholly Happy EndingThis is an hysterical end to a wonderful and funny series! I will miss it very much.
2,More Ham Than Human...,"Despite the presence of the stunning Gong Li sauntering about in a silky bathrobe and a fairly decent performance from Gaspard Ulliel, I still have to summarise this film with a pronounced and very distinct ""meh"", simply because the sheer nastiness present in Harris' other tales of the good doctor was missing and because of some very lazy continuity. Simply put, when viewed in light of what comes later in the illustrious doctor's career, all credibility goes out of the window. It would have made far more sense if said cannibalistic killer had gone by a different name in Europe and had adopted the name 'Hannibal Lecter' upon entering Canada /America. That I could've forgiven. As it is, this film just doesn't make sense with regard to the continuity of the series."
3,"Good movie, entertaining","Decent acting, and production quality, too. Good score, etc.Story was a bit underdeveloped and drawn out. They could have added more character development, etc.and kept up with Hannibal for a longer time period. I wanted to see more of his story up until we meet him incarcerated in ""Silence of the Lambs."" Still, it was enjoyable and fun to watch, so I give it 3 stars. I suppose there is still room for another movie that takes place before Silence..."
2,Terminally boring,"It took three sittings in an attempt to get through this movie. The big ""oh my God, now it makes sense"" revelation at the end of the (I hate to use the word) film, was obvious in the first ten minutes. I don't know what the running time is for Hannibal Rising, but my guess would be 540 minutes. At least that's what it felt like. A mish-mash of quasi Nazi-Asian ancestor worship/revenge was a witless ploy in an attempt to build some sort of plot. There is no backbone here, nothing to lead to the Hannibal we all know and love. And whoever the mechanical rather than maniacal lead actor is (or was, if he acts again) couldn't savor a fava bean if his life depended on it. Skip this one, go out to your favorite seafood place and eat a fish cheek. Your money will have been better spent."
3,Out For Revenge Or Made A Monster?,"I just got done watching ""Hannibal Rising"" this evening. Hmmmm, not sure what to make of it! I've read and seen ""Red Dragon"" (which I loved by the way), ""Silence of the Lambs"", & ""Hannibal""....After reading many negative reviews for both the book and movie versions of ""Hannibal Rising"", I wasn't sure if I wanted anything to do with the book or the movie.... However, decided to watch the movie for myself and form my own opinion.Honestly, I don't think ""Hannibal Rising"" is as bad as everyone has made it out to be. It is suppose to be a prequel, giving us the idea of why Hannibal is the way he is as an adult. I thought ""Hannibal Rising"" was suspenseful and well acted by the cast members. We see Hannibal as a monster out for revenge for those who killed his younger sister. This is where Hannibal begins to learn and refine his murderous appetite that we later refined when he becomes an adult..... What starts out as revenge turns into gruesome psychopathic behavior."
4,A great movie,I loved this one. The explanations for the character-creation of Hannibal was very interesting. Not for children.
1,I quit after an hour of it as a book on tape,"This was a 3 hour book on tape and after being regaled for more than half an hour with all of the details of a battle in which I neither knew who was fighting or why they were fighting I decided that I'd had enough.These Clancy rip-off story lines only go to show that Clancy has a special talent for developing characters when he actually writes the books. It also shows that he has a special talent for soaking up the cash wherever he can. What a con - let Clancy creates the characters and let hacks write the books for him!Please, don't waste your time!"
3,"Interesting, but needs work","Shadow Watch (ISBN 0-425-17188-4) by Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg is a descent book, but needs more development. This is the only book in the Power Plays series that I have read, but I have read other Tom Clancy books. I found the story hard to start, but once I got past the opening paragraphs the story was okay. The characters, particularly Annie Caulfield, need a little more fleshing out. The overall plot is plausible, but there are some holes that are not typical of Tom Clancy's style. Overall a good book for reading, if there is nothing else available."
1,I recommend you not spend time or money on this one.,This is another Clancy book I can't recommend. The plot was not believable and it ended with a whisper. This did not have the feel or readability of a Clancy book. The characters and plot were trite and the villian was pretty pitiful. Try harder next time guys will you! I'm not going to buy any more books from you just because your name appears as the author on the front cover! I recommend you not spend your money or time on this one.
2,More Ghostwriter Material!,"At one time Clancy could claim the title of the greatest writer on earth. After I have read Net Force,Op Center and these Power Play books I have started reading the Robert Ludlum books. The villain in this book is terrible. The hero in this book is just about as bad. I have yet to figure out what the plot is.This book was just plain bad.I hope Tom Clancy starts taking his writing more serious. Maybe he can come back to life with the Bear and the Dragon."
2,Half-Way Decent,"As this is the first Tom Clancy read, although I have several movies based on his books, suck as The Hunt for the Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger.Although I thought his writing was good and was a cliff-hanger like feeling throughout the book, as I read other reviews I guess his other books must have been alot better.Anyways some of the sub-plots were well written and were interesting (urchin diving with Tom Ricci), they only showed he was tough and the man for the job, but took to many pages to show it. Also the train wreck took to long to explain with insignificant people who just died in the end. It was important to the fact that the Terroists weapon was ready for use, but the extant to the wreck was explained was un-necessary.The whole part in Russia where the guerrilas buy the HMD or whatever is still kind of hazy as to what actually happened."
1,It got 2 stars for 1/5 of it's pages.,Start reading it only if you get it for free! Read the first 60 pages and ask someone to tell one what else happenes. It will take him around 1.2 seconds to do so. It's not worth 200+ pages.
5,My son loves it!,I personally just thought it was okay but he loves it! He is learning so much. It is a really good way for kids to learn. I thought it was boring an uninspired but they must really get on the kids level. I have even had a friends hard to handle 7 year old at my home and he was even quiet when watching. Good buy!
1,Great Video - Watch for repeat titles,This is a great video. I'm giving it one star only because it is exactly the same a previous product just with a different cover. The cover and 2011 date give you the impression you are getting another episode but you aren't. Be careful because LeapFrog doesn't number the products. I'm sure this just is another example of great American marketing efforts that feel that products do better if you just change the colors or pictures for no reason. This is usually the sad end of a sucessful product. Hopefully not in this case.
3,Learn to read,Not as great as the Word and Letter Factory but the song teaching Punctuation is definitely a great one.
3,entertaining but not quite effective as a reading tool,"After Letter Factory and the Talking Words Factory I found this dvd a bit disappointing; perhap is only because my son is 3 and the dvd may be a bit too advance for him. However, I am compelled to add that my son loves this dvd and has requested it several times. This movie may not assist much in his reading process but he finds it entertaining."
4,The Storybook Factory,"My kids enjoy this DVD and watch it frequently. It is a natural follow up to the previous videos, although I was kind of expecting a sentence/paragraphs one first. My almost 4 year old does not get all of the educational content, but it seems to line up well with what my older child is doing in kindergarten (teaching characters, punctuation, prediction, etc). My only major complaint is that ""learning to read"" happens really quick... it goes from Tad reading like a typical 5 year old (one word independent of the next) to fluent speech in the matter of about 20 minutes. Doesn't seem to bother the children though! I also am a little annoyed by some of the ""sideline"" stories... some of them are a little distracting and don't seem to add much in educational content or entertainment value. Overall though, very happy with purchase."
2,Minimal educational value,"I'm a speech-language pathologist who works with learning disabilities and teaches early reading skills. The Leap Frog Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, and Code Word Caper are some of the best resources I've found. These movies systematically introduce and teach the basics of phonics in an effective and creative way. The Letter Factory is particularly good and appropriate for children as young as two.The Story Book Factory and the The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park don't follow a well structured system nor do they do a good job of teaching the things they presume to teach such as punctuation. Taken as a movie for entertainment, the Amusement Park one is bearable but the Story Book Factory is very dumb. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 3.Also, the Numbers Ahoy one doesn't do a very good job of teaching anything except for counting."
1,A Travesty,"I would give it no stars if possible.Quite apart from the hiss on some tracks, there is every reason to avoid this album if you have any interest in Allegri's music.Allegri wrote a coherent piece of *choral* music of about 10-12 minutes. This a choppy ""new ageification"" of the piece with not especially notable singing which extends the piece over an entire album. Allegri's music is interspersed with modern compositions and intrumentation. Worse, all sorts of tricks are played with timing -- voices being slowed down to create heaven knows what desired effect [try track 8].There are many other recordings of Allegri available (even of pieces other than the Miserere). Personally I would recommend the older recording by the Tallis scholars (which also have some glorious music by Palestrina.)"
5,Charming Flick!,"This movie is charming, original, and unpredictable. I LOVED IT! The interaction between characters is fun and, at times, hilarious. They're very real and easy to relate to. A great true-to-life romantic comedy. I loved it and highly recommend it."
2,Some thought-provoking ideas but not enough practical detail,"This book from Mr.Jenkins contains some interesting ideas mainly suited with WD Gann students.Some parts of the book are truly interesting, but you will very often feel frustrated since the author does not go into details, mainly since ""he can't share his discoveries"".According to the author, the reader should start from the clues he leaves here and there in the book to develop his own analyses. Though if this position about the need of self study is fully acceptable, at least in my experience, the clues left were not enough to develop through my study specific trading strategies and techniques."
5,impressive,This game is ground-breaking. It has unbelievable cars and stunning graphics. The customizing options make you want to sit in front of your tv and play all day long. The gameplay is unimaginably fast-paced and exciting. Five out of five in my opinion.
1,"Fun game, but why so expensive?","I've been wanting to buy this for ages, but I'm not shelling out $80 for it.This game is 7 years old. Is there really that much demand for this game towarrant such an exorbitant price?Amazon, please lower the cost..."
2,Defective,The razor worked for one month. Then it it would not shut off. The battery had to be removed when not in use. After 30 days the razor ceased to operate. A new battery was installed. It does not work.
2,"Cheaply printed, limited","When I received this book in the mail, I was shocked at how cheaply it had been printed. Anyone familiar with the cheap cardboard backed books put out by another catholic publishing house that I won't mention, will recognize the similiar handiwork here. The paper is of the poorest quality, the binding is destined to crack with little use, etc. This is hardly worth the [money] charged. The two week cycle of prayer used here will quickly become monotonous to most diligent practitioners of regular prayer. If you are serious about starting the Hours, invest in Phyllis Tickle's ""Divine Hours"" here at Amazon."
2,"Good photos, political crap","This is an excellent photograhic review which supports sound ideas and conclussions about 9/11 in N.Y., not about the attack on the Pentagon.Unfortunately, like several books on this topic, the authors detract all credibility form it by showing a very demodé political bias (1960's) and information crap about Latin America and other underdeveloped regions. The ultra-green perspective and all the nonsense they say about Cuba is extremely sorrowful and so very much lacking in information and personal experience.The green-biofuel diatribe shows their absolute ignorance on engineering, and especially on energy.A pity they added the ""political chapter"". An ""own goal""."
3,Wrong Catalog Listing,"First, there was nothing wrong with the filter or the shipping services. The only complaint I have is that the filter listed for my application in the online catalog is the wrong filter. I was ordering a filter for a '89 Dodge W150 with TBI and got a fitler for a carberated application. Lucky for Amazon, I also have a vehicle that I can use these filters on."
5,Great Book for What it Is,"This book is not meant to be an in-depth, complete scientific argument against Darwinism and the like. It is instead an introduction to 1) the problems with the macroevolution argument as science (it is, rather, a philosophy), and 2) exposing the type of illogical argument a person will run into from the macroevolution crowd. It is written for the high school student and typical, every-day, non-scientificly-minded parents. An introduction to this topic. As such, I wouldn't expect the information presented to be covered so thoroughly as some of the reviewers apparently expected. For the audience and reasons he wrote this book, Phillip Johnson did an outstanding, 5-star job. I enjoyed the book, which was easy enough to read, well-sited, and fair-minded. I am now prepared and looking forward to going on to more thorough books addressing these issues at an even deeper level."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Another anti-intellectual diatribe....Darwninian evolution is an outstanding scientific theory, that has stood the test of time. Much of modern biology, physics, cosmology, geology and large parts of chemistry and medicine require natural selection as an essential part of their explanatory power. It is nothing but arrogance (and ignorance) on the part of the author (and creationists in general) to imply (for that is what he indirectly does) that all of these sciences are fundamentally flawed. Creationism is a non-issue in Europe. Please grow up America!-you are an embarrasment to the world!"
1,"""Intellegent design"", eh?",Let's hope the intelligent designer makes fewer mistakes than the positive reviewers of this book do.Please keep in mind that you are reading the work of a lawyer who has stepped outside his area of expertise.
1,No stable,what can I say it sucks. its loose and I'm trying to return. Don't buy the worse choice you'll ever make when it comes to seated calf machines
5,"A mostly unknown singer , I discovered him by chance...","Forgetting the many well known songs on this CD and concentrating solely on the feeling the listener gets from the singer , I would say this is an extremely good CD .The Australian company Raven Records often release value packed collections - this is no exception .The songs are well played and the arrangements tasteful , Johnny's voice taking you inside the heart of the songs .Country fans should listen to someone different for a change , from back when image took a back seat to talent .Johnny Darrell will not disappoint ."
5,Great for Beginners,"For many, Crewel is an art form which uses yarn on fabric using embroidery stitches. Katherine challenges this notion by creating traditional techniques in a contemporary fashion. The book explains the tools of the trade along with fabrics and threads. How to start and end threads, mounting and transferring the design are all explained in great detail.After we have finished the basics, Mrs. Shaughnessy takes us into ""New Crewel Stitches."" Here, we are introduced to several stitches. Next, projects are given. Several square motifs are stitched and explained. Canning jar lids, blue jeans, pillow tops, lamp shade, eye glasses case, apron, skirt, scarves and mesh bag are all included in this beautifully illustrated book. You are given full instructions from start to finish.All in all, ""The New Crewel"" is a great beginner book which I feel advanced stitchers would also enjoy."
5,Renew your desire to create works of art with thread,"In my youth, I used enjoy doing embroidery projects, but grew bored with the typical imagery associated with the techniques involved (pillowcases and linen dishtowels - ugh). So I put it away until recently when I saw the renewed interest probably due to artists like Ms. Shaughnessy. This book encouraged me to create my own images using various types of thread (discussed in the materials and tools section). The stitches used and developed by the author, who focused on crewel when she was younger, is artistically stimulating. The author's amazing work is creative and so often draws your eye across the work as one would do with a classic painting in a museum. In addition, her discussion on the history of crewel (too brief IMHO) evokes the thread artistry tradition from the past to the ""new"" work of today. This book provides an excellent way to bring the passion back to thread art (crewel, embroidery)."
1,Let me be blunt- The product does not work,"It does require a long detailed review. It's simple. System Mechanic 7 is a complete loser. The software does not open 50% of the time and then you have to reinstall it. Then it opens 4 times and won't open again. ,,,,,,"
3,bad explanations,"Like most math-based textbooks, this one explains the concepts in their most basic form, but is no help at all when you're trying to figure out how to get beyond the basic. The problems at the end of each chapter (which will probably constitute your homework) are either verbatim copies of the examples, or are so much more advanced than the examples that you might as well just use Google as your textbook. Either way, examples are sparse, and you feel like you're missing something when you try to do any of the problems.This is a moot point for most people reading this, since you've probably been assigned it for a class, but if you're a professor please take pity on your students and assign them another book!"
4,Okay - nothing new,This is okay for a fisherman wanting to learn more about bass fishing specifically. Great for a walleye guy wanting to learn about bass.
5,But this album on their site,"These guys are sick, but you can get all their albums for cheap on www.silverbackmusicstore.comenjoi"
1,Broke too soon,"We received this same urn as a wedding gift and it worked for 8 solid years (we use it about once a week for a 12-plus hour stretch). When it broke, we purchased the same one, hoping it would last the same length of time. Now it has broken after a mere 16 months - too late to be covered by warranty, but an unacceptably premature break down for the price.I will now be purchasing this product again."
3,I like some of his other CD's better,"Maybe it's all in the timing, but I didn't enjoy this CD as much as I had hoped to. I really like Josh Groban's voice and music...."
4,A great voice!,Good job! One suggestion: he could be well dressed. But this detail doesn't take the brightness of these great artist.
2,Needs more upbeat songs,"Don't get me wrong, I liked a few tracks on the DVD, but I lost my attention watching it because it was just slow song after slow song, and frankly, I got bored. I like ""Josh Groban Noel"" quite a bit more."
3,"Great voice, no action","First, I'm a huge fan of Josh Grobin's. Saw the Awake concert in person twice and was totally enthralled each time. Unfortunately, for me, the excitement of seeing him live is not generated by this DVD. It's too polished and most of the audience interaction was cut. The interaction during the concert created a nice balance between the dramatic music and the playfulness of the singer which is missing on the DVD. Parts of the DVD seem to highlight Josh's awkwardness with faster tempo music. He knows he can't dance but his minimal attempts seem forced for the sake of the DVD. The two times I saw him live he moved much more naturally. However, the music is fantastic and Lucia Micarelli's Kashmir rocks. If you're Josh Groban fan this is a must have."
3,A Different View,"I became a Groban fan after seeing him in a one-night-only concert version of the rock musical ""Chess"" on Broadway. I started buying his CDs and DVDs. Watching this DVD was fun, but, for the first time, too many of the songs sound alike.On his last DVD, Josh included Simon & Garfunkle's ""America"" as an encore. He has sung famous movie songs with John Williams and the Boston Pops. His songs from the ""Chess"" concert are some of the most watched videos on the Internet. His recent traditional Christmas CD was one of the best selling holiday CDs of all time.Clearly, Josh Groban has achieved great success. Isn't it now time to try other things in his concerts? He has done it on Broadway and CD. If anything, I believe Groban has taken a step backward with this concertDVD."
2,phew,xl is way too big and the smell of the coat is horrible. I have it hanging outside on my balcony and may never bring it in.
2,Plutarch: The historian that changes history,"You have ancient historians like Polybius, Thucydides, and Seutonius who tell the facts and do not change them. But with Plutarch, it's a different ballgame. Plutarch wants to make the good people look bad and the bad people look good. Try to avoid any book written by Plutarch for all the lives he has written about are sketchy. I was kind enough to give the book two stars so if you actually are resding this, here's my advise: if you have money to blow, get it and try and read it, but don't go out of your way."
2,Ivory Tower,"Judge Stewart views our concerns about our children and our future as a phase we must push past to expedite the legal process. This book was written by habitant of the Ivory Tower. So much of what happens to us is not worth his consideration. Every mediator, attorney and judge should have to go through a rough child custody case to make them eligible to serve the legal system. I think Judge James W. Stewart protects the law better than he protects children's access to both parents. This book is fine it is just nothing special."
3,It does work,I bought the portable fan/heater and mine works. I was surprised when I opened the box and saw the fan was cream. Its grey in the pictures on the website. The heater does work but it does not get as hot as one I purchase from Home Depot.
2,Ehh,"This didn't make me become a HUGE Greg Raposo fan, but it's got some good songs on it. It's an ok shot as a first post-Dream Street CD."
3,OMG this cd rocks!,This CD was so wicked awesome. I have always been a greg raposo fan and i couldnt have been any happier when the cd finally came out. when i had bought it i had never heard a greg raposo song from his solo career but i knew i would like it anyway anmd i did! i deffinetly would reccomend this cd for people of all ages espically former dream street fans! GO GREG THIS CD ROCKS
1,Jelly beans were hard and not at all fresh,"The black jelly beans I received were hard and barely edible. The bag inside the box was burst open and jelly beans were everywhere..Most other orders from different companies were fresh, soft and in good order. I would not recommend buying anything From the Candy Banditt.. Sincerely, dakota 13"
3,Shipping needs attention,Price and product acceptable but shipping was crushed and flimsy plastic bag was broken and jelly beans lay open in cardboard box. Needed more padding.
5,Serious criticism,"This is a must for anyone concerned about civil liberties and individual rights. Democrats take notice!! If you don't why so many Democrats left the Democrat Party, you need to read this book. I was a former Democratic Party activist. Clinton and Gore are the RIGHT WING of the Democratic Party. Clinton's actions in office, as written in this book, prove the point. My home town Omaha is mentioned for misuse of Federal funds."
1,refrain,"If you like this music then you need your head checked, although your probably busy watching MTV. We competed with them at Battle of the Bands in high school, seems to me they are still stuck there. Bitter? Yes. Just show you what connections can get you in life. I feel sorry for Jordon, he doesn't deserve it. The girl that caused the song was nothing special either. Psst! Hey Clutch, tell Throttle I said what up. By the way 1 star is way too much."
4,Entertaining,"This novel offers a good story set in an intriguing place, with some nifty information about the properties of peat bogs and a few interesting asides about Irish history. I found this book especially good as amusement during my commute to work on the train. It would also be good for a long airplane ride, as it holds the reader's attention without being overly taxing intellectually.There are a couple of clever plot twists too, and I found the characters quite likable. I assume that Erin Hart's heroine, Nora Gavin, will return in future novels and I will keep my eye out for her."
4,"Good Mystery, Excellent Irish Story","I was really drawn to the plot of this story, not because it was such a great mystery, but because the author obviously has a love of all things Irish and gives us a nice look at Irish life today. The characters of Nora Gavin, Cormac Maguire, and Garret Devaney are exceptionally well-written, but all of the characters are interesting and deserving of our attention. The two main mystery plots were less interesting and tied up too neatly at the end. I mean, who didn't know who the real killers were the moment the author introduced them? But, as I say, it was not necessarily the mystery aspect that drew me. Hats off to Erin Hart for creating such real, non-sterotypical Irish people for her first novel. I look forward to reading the further stories of Nora and Cormac."
5,Great gift,Great service great gift item hard to find item. Would purchase again for another man's gift. Really good price on this brush.
4,Good overview for the newbie,"I am launching my own video production company with one employee (so far) - myself. This book did a good job of covering basic fundamentals from how to find clients to how to prepare a proposal to how to maintain professionalism, etc. A few good examples are given throughout the book as well. It could have gone into each of the topics in more detail with more examples, but this is a very good reference to start with."
1,Funky Music,"This is the best in upbeat funky music around. All the songs make you want to get up and dance - even if you are horrible at dancing. My sister played this back in the early 70's and I thought she was so cool. Now even though I am 50, this music makes me feel cool and it will still be playing for a very long time"
1,Terrible!!!!,"This sunshade is absolutely terrible. Just like other reviewers mentioned, it simply does not fit the stroller. Returned next day! I cannot believe bugaboo still manufactures these things."
4,"Not perfect, but great for the money",Assembly did not take too long: about 45 minutes. The parts do not fit together really tightly (parts move a little bit when you put pressure on it) but for the price and its purpose it is more than suitable. Comparable items were over 100 dollars and this item works just fine. My cat already loves it.
1,hope you don't have a problem with it! Terrible customer service,"I purchased this product thinking it would be great for my cats in the bathroom. When it came, the door had two top hinges on it instead of one top one and one bottom one. I called the customer service and it went straight to voicemail. A woman called me back two days later and (I thought) we set it up so that they would mail me another door. It never came, but I had already thrown away the packaging that had their customer service number on it. I can NOT find contact information for them online! I have gone to merryproducts.com and you can only leave an email. I went to merrypet.com and their contact information is international - in China."
1,Broken,"I purchased this product because I really liked the idea of hiding the cat box. I was very disappointed when I received it, I was unable to put it together, because the manufacture cut the pieces wrong. Very frustrating. I ended up going to a local store and purchasing one that was already together. While trying to put it together, I was very disappointed to see that the wood is very flimsy.Amazon was very helpful with my return, which was greatly appreciated."
5,Our cats love this product,Found this product packaged very well. It was easy to put together. And our cats just love it. Very nice
5,Great for Multiple Cats,good size when you combine with the Van Ness Cat Litter Box - L. Highly Recommend.
3,Great Idea...,"This is a great idea, but it could be so much nicer and should be for the price! First, opening the carton was a pain and everything was jammed tightly in with cheap Styrofoam that fell apart in little pieces all over the place when I unpacked the box. All the pieces were nicely labeled, however, and I thought the instructions were well written. This is where I became disappointed in the product. When they say don't over tighten, they mean don't even think about tightening the locking cams beyond what a two year-old could do. I thought I should tighten them until they stopped turning and broke a cam (fortunately, they had included an extra) and I also messed up the ""wood"" finish on the outside at the same time. I would think for the price the manufacturer could use a little higher quality of fiber board or, even better, particle board to make this a sturdy piece of furniture."
2,Did not assemble well and did not last well,We bought two and sort of feel we wasted our money on them. They didn't assemble well and weren't very sturdy. The cats weren't interested in using them so it just didn't work out for us. We had to contact the manufacturer because one of them arrived with broken pieces in it. They did send out what we needed.
4,Great Taj Ma Toilet!,"I was honestly surprised at how easily my cats took to this litter cabinet. They much prefer it over the standard litter box (based on how much I have to scoop)and do even use the top to lie around and window gaze.This unit is a replacement for the original I purchased that arrived short one piece. I did find the manufacturer to be not even remotely helpful. The packaging instructed to call the manufacturer for missing parts but when I did so, I was very curtly informed to contact Amazon. Amazon, as usual, immediately shipped another cabinet.Do not expect this cabinet to be tidier than a normal littler box. Litter still escapes the cabinet and still requires sweeping up. Also, the construction is a bit light so it is not a really sturdy, solid piece of furniture. All in all, I am very pleased and may eventually purchase another."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I guess if all you are going for is a certain look then this is ok. A regular litter box with a lid would work just the same as this and it would take up less space. I like the look of the cabinet but in order to keep the floor from having kitty litter all over the place I have to turn the cabinet with the door facing the back wall. I used to have a corner litter box with a lid and there was a lot less mess on the floor with that than having an open litter box inside this cabinet. It just wasn't worth the money for any reason. It takes up too much space, you can still see the litter box, and it doesn't help with the mess. My cat is not one of those cats who just kicks litter up real high all over the place. He is pretty tidy, but there isn't much that can be done to avoid a mess with this cabinet. If you are looking for one then you should probably try your luck with one that is a little longer so there will be more space between the litter box and the door. Hope this helps!"
1,Holes are too big,"I'm mechanically inclined and have plenty of experience putting together cheap furniture from IKEA, so it's definitely not me. The holes for the bolts on panel B are too big, so there's no way to attach that side. Not even bothering with an exchange. For $100 I expected it to be at least slightly sturdier than it was, and definitely for it to be able to be assembled upon arrival. So annoying!"
3,inhouse/outhouse,"This is made of fiberboard, not wood, and altho' attractive, was difficult to put together and had a crack in it before I even had it completed. Also, description should have specified that interior would only hold a flat litter pan and given dimensions. However, I can continue using old covered pan I had for litter and let this item accomplish what I especially needed, which was to keep the dog away from the cat food:)"
2,Poor book,Definitely not the best book out there. I've read a bunch of this books and actually wish I wouldn't spend the money on this one... may be you want to try another one.
3,It couldn't be clearer . . .,". . . that Jaci Velasquez is one talented vocalist. Musically, this CD is a real pleaser, with moods varying from the energetic, Britney Spears-ish ""Every Time I Fall"" (which I can't help but like even though I don't like Britney Spears) to the tender, beautiful ""Adore."" So why only three stars? The songs on this CD all seem to, lyrically, sound the same. ""I'm in love with Jesus and you should be too."" Don't misunderstand--I certainly have nothing against praise songs, and ""Adore"" is one of the finest I've heard in awhile. What Jaci needs, though, are some songs that will challenge her teen listeners (me included) to take a stand--songs that will address specific issues that we face today (and we all know there are plenty of them). Instead, we get a CD composed almost entirely of fluffy ""love songs,"" of Christian cotton candy that tastes great--even melts in your mouth--but doesn't leave you with much food for thought."
3,Crystal Clear,"Crystal clear is a disappointment after Jaci Velasquez' previous two albums, Llegar a ti and Jaci Velasquez. The lyrics were poorly written with a fair dose of cliches. She writes few of her lyricsEscuchame-upbeat music, easy to sing along withCrystal Clear-slower; good music, but words that sound like they were thrown together in a few minutes.Every time I fall-boring, formulaic dance-pop trackYou're not there-among the best trax on this cdAdore-fairly good song. It's slower, but still ok.You don't miss a thing-Boring."
3,Good basic and cheap model...but flawed,"I've had basically good, if quirky, performance from my deck. It's convenient having the two trays, and I'm impressed that the deck will copy the HDCD and DTS subcode data, which my otherwise immeasurably superior ... Pioneer Elite machine won't do.Others have mentioned problems with finalization, and I've found these to be brand dependent. The only brand that's consistently recorded and added to and finalized without hitches is Memeorex *audio* CD-Rs. No-name brands should be avoided, and even Fujifilm audio CD-Rs, which work fine in my Pioneer, will not finalize in this deck (I've had to put the discs in my other deck for that!).So...if the price is right, buy with open eyes, but I'd recommend spending a little more for a Pioneer, which has a better user interface as well. Pioneer seems to have found a winning front-panel composition and stuck with it!"
1,Nothing but problems,"Philips just doesn't know what they're doing, plain and simple. I went through 3 different units and they all had the same problems! Read some of the other reviews for the list of problems; I've encountered most of them. I can't stress how bad their burners are! What a headache having to send it out just to come back with the same problems...on 3 different units none the less! I finally demanded my money back from Circuit City (who I wouldn't recommend either) and went with the Pioneer 839 from Tweeter (who are light years better than CC) and have been very happy with it."
1,"Problems, Problems...","I have to number myself among the nay-sayers who have had loads of problems with this unit. I have already had Philips replace my old, defective with a new deck and, right out of the box, I had the same old problems with: 1. Not finalizing CDs, 2. ""Disc Error"" messages, 3. Wasted CDs that would not format, not be recognized, or not be ejected.It also will not work with 80 minute Music CDRWs, so forget buying these, although that's increasingly all that you can find available these days in stores.It's a lose-lose machine, compounded by Philips terrible customer service, not-in-service phone numbers, and general ""try to find us, we dare you"" approach to repairs.Buyer be ware!"
4,"good value, easy to use and very portable","i bought this handycam while on holiday in the usa, mainly to video my little cousin who is 18 months. the exchange rate meant that i saved 100 ($200).its extremely easy to use. the minidv tapes are very cheap and if you have a dvd burner you can get very good quality video's directly. the battery life is sufficient but one of the best things is the sound quality and microphone pic up. i was 10 metres away on a wind swept beach but the camera picked up my voice perfectly. did nt give it 5 stars because it does nt come with a firewire cable and irritatingly i have to buy to different cables to use it on a sony laptop and a apple mac"
5,Perfection,"This CD is guarenteed to bring tears to your eyes. There has never been a voice as pure and as beautiful as Eva's. Once again she proves she could handle any kind of music, and each song becomes her own. Her voice comes from someplace deep inside and she wears her soul on her sleeve. Run don't walk to buy ""American Tune""."
3,Good things don't last forever,"I have been a fan of Eva ever since 'Songbird' came out in 1998.I take great delight in all her previous 'official' albums.She was a magnificent singer, second to none.We have been blessed with some excellent posthumous songs, but there was always a limit to what was available.It must be remembered that the songs on American Tune are all discards.They were put aside and forgotten about because it was decided they were not good enough to release.These songs are not as good as previous Eva CDs.This is not a criticism of Eva. Mostly they are from rehearsal tapes, and it show.In 'Yesterday' Eva two time shrieks out some of the lyrics in a harsh manner.I am sure she would have never wanted this track to be released. She was a perfectionist, and didn't even want 'Live at Blues Alley' released.It seems to me that 'American Tune' scrapes the bottom of the barrel. At least we have better albums than this to remember her by."
1,Disappointment from incorrect lyrics,"I bought this CD specifically because Eva covers Simon & Garfunkel's ""American Tune"" and the preview on Amazon sounded good. However, upon purchase and listening, this song was performed with a major lyrical blunder that completely changes the song and makes it unlistenable. Specifically, she completes the first verse with ""Still tomorrows goin' to be another workin' day, And I'm trying to get some rest,That's all I'm trying to get some rest."" This is the lyric for the fourth and final verse, not for the end of the first and it completely alters the song's meaning.The rest of the CD sounded like someone singing with a karoake machine - too much emphasis on the vocal performance. It didn't blend well, though I understand that this particular collection was some working material and not a final, polished product."
4,"Good, solid watch w/o all the bells & whistles","This watch is very comfortable to wear. It's so light i often forget i have it on. I also enjoy being able to wear it into the shower, because it makes it easy to give it a quick cleaning. I've never needed to pay any special attention to making sure it gets enough light. The glow in the dark hands and dial markers are very bright and easy to read.The only down side is that you have to reset the date after a month that has less than 31 days. This is because the date dial just counts up to 31 every month. However, setting this is very easy and takes just a second or two to do.I'm very happy with the watch and suggest it to any man who wants a simple, comfortable, stylish watch."
3,... but this album is,"First, let's get the issue of lineage out of the way: vocalist/guitarist/main songwriter Joe Sumner is the eldest son of one Gordon Sumner, aka Sting. And yes, Joe does eerily sound like Dad at times (especially when singing in an upper register).But this album --and consequently Joe Sumner, himself-- stands on its own. A solid U2-by-way-of-Nirvana-influenced debut that creates positive expectations for a follow-up. Highlights: ""Listen To My Babe"", ""Cigarette"", ""Real Real"", and the title track."
1,Agree with ksrb totally,Simplistic and totally unremarkable. There's been so much hype about these guys but I too was disappointed with this CD
2,Average,"Album is pretty average when compared to all the other really cool bands around, vocals are weak. Best song on album is cigarette."
4,very classy watch. Can be work casual or as a dress watch,"I bought this watch for my dad for Father's day and he loved it. He liked the fact that it has a 2 tone effect to it. The gold tone gives it a dressy and elegant feel and the steel design keeps it masculine and sporty.On receiving the shipment I noticed that the second hands were skipping, on reading the manual I realized that was probably because the watch was loosing it's light battery power due to lack of light.. My dad said that he gave the watch a good 15 minutes of direct sunlight which got it fully charged again.."
3,Consensual Sadomasochism,"The book was very well written. For those that are new to the lifestyle it is a good starting book, as it explaines what to learn as to what you and your partner like. For those in the lifestayle sometimes it is a good thing to review and learn something new from a book that has been revised.The book express important facts ,CPR,First Aid."
5,Excellent tool for many things,"I bought one of these staple removers years ago. It is so handy not only for removing staples, but also for prying open other things. I wanted to get one more for another part of the house, but was told by OfficeMax that ""they don't make them anymore."" Staples doesn't have them either. I was bummed but thought I'd try the Internet. I'm glad I did. I have not dealt with this vendor before (I have with Amazon), so I hope I get my staple removers with no problems."
3,Unusual take on historical romance.,"I enjoyed this unusual story line. Having a fascination with the Civil War and how it changed the face of the US, this was a good read."
5,Am just re reading this and.............,I remembered how much I had enjoyed it the first time I read it years ago. LLM has given her characters realism and an emotional depth that makes every encounter worthwhile. Even the children Millie and Charlotte are delightful individuals. I will finish this tonight but I will be keeping it......LLM has a wonderful writing style and I've enjoyed several of her books.
4,Vendor is excellent,"Kent quality control seems spotty. My brush shed a large number of bristles. But the vendor replaced my 1st brush with a new one with no hassle at all, and the replacement is fine."
1,A disappointing and difficult read!,"I found this book to be a disappointingly sparse and sometimes unintelligible history of St. Andrews and its caddies. The author unfortunately presumes that the reader is intimately familiar with both the golf course layout and the native language of it's caddies. Consequently there are no helpful maps or diagrams included and frequent referral to the glossary is an awkward but necessary expedient to reach a degree of understanding. Sadly under this burden the folksy stories lost their charm. To maximize your pleasure, I recommend that you keep a "" wee nip"" at your side during the reading of this very short work."
3,"Pretty good detergent, but does not dissolve well.","I found that this detergent works fine, but does not dissolve in cold water and left little granules on all of my clothes when I washed in cold water."
1,factual errors abound,"The majority of the arguments presented by the author, while backed up by statistics and numbers in the text, are skewed to represent the authors opinion. the author writes about womens motivations, not based upon interviews with women in service, but based on his own opinion."
4,Pop Rocks for Adults,"Although I'm not overly fond of live recordings, this is one I really do like. The shrill teen-pop sound of Sweet's early records has been thankfully traded up for a more hard core rock sound. The quality is good and the performance has energy. Consider it Sweet played by adults for adults."
1,Poor quality,"I got this for my 7 yr.old for Christmas. He loves it, but it began falling apart the first day and has, piece by piece, become totally non-functional. First the pitching button broke, so we just rolled it by hand. Next, the batter figure broke off - not a necessary part, we just did without. Then the lever you pull back to set the batter up to swing broke off. Since you now can't pitch or bat, you can't play. It's so sad because my son really loves this. He tries to just pretend with the players - but even that isn't fun because he doesn't have a batter any more.Really disappointing for a pricey toy. It's so sad to watch him try to play with it, I'm online now to find a replacement of some kind for him."
5,Home Improvement rules!,This was well worth the price. Tim Allen is hilarious and Home Improvement was one of the best family comedy shows of its time. I bought the collection in order to share it with my son who absolutely loves it.
4,"arr, arr","I'll be honest, I liked Al Borland much better than Tim Taylor. I couldn't imagine being married to Tim, he would totally grate on my nerves. I found myself frustrated with how he would just ignore his wife when she told him to leave things alone, but then he often got his comeuppance, so it sort of evened out. This was a pretty amusing show, and AL made the perfect balance to Tim's character. Overall a funny show, though it won't suit everyone's tastes."
1,Refund/Exchange,"I was going through and watching these and came across a few discs that would freeze in the middle of watching. I know it is not my player because I tried different discs in my player and nothing wrong, I also played the malfunctioning discs in different players and the same thing. I would like a refund or an exchange."
3,Words Are Beautiful Story is Vanilla,"While thoroughly enjoying the images created by the way Adam Rapp creatively and captively arranges the words on the pages to envoke the widest ranges of emotions and feelings, I walked away from the book being very disappointed with the story. It's vanilla. Plain, homemade, vanilla. Sure it's got it's shocking opening and that carries through the first two chapters amazingly well. But it kept going And going. And going, to a point where I didn't care anymore about that character and the predictable path he goes through as his life spirals downward into a pit that, once again, Adam Rapp created so eloquently with his words.Overall, it was worth it for the glory of the words, you just have to sit through a boring story to get them all. Fortunately, for many, in our society innundated with half-hour television shows and fast paced, seat-of-your-pants living, our attenion span has become....limited. So therefore, like our attention, plays these days, are short."
3,Peck Box,"This isn't a well built Deck Box since it's so cheaply made of plastic. On top of that, I had it shipped to the Volga region, which cost me about $[...]. I probably should have invested in something locally made out of wood or bricks, but I hadn't thought of that. The purpose of it was to store old shoes given to me by the local shoemaker, but he went out of business. Now I only use it to store dead rats that I have found on the countryside property."
2,not secure,"It was easy to put together and very spacious. It's just that when you lean on it while bending over to put something in it, some sides cave in. Also is the top is opened back too far the sides are vulnerable. The plastic doesn't lock into the base securely, thereby caving in."
5,just what we wanted,"we needed a big box to keep some firewood dry in the winter and store deck and pool stuff in the summer. This fits the bill perfectly for us, decent price, seems pretty solid and as a bonus you can sit on it."
3,An interesting look at the formation of the X-Men,"Joe Casey's story is solid, and gives Professor X and the original X-Men (Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Iceman, and Marvel Girl) a backstory that they have needed for quite some time. The only real problem that I had is that the artists changed from chapter to chapter, and the change can be a bit jarring."
3,smaller than I pictured it.,"The kids did not stay interested for long, not worth $9.99. All of the magnets need to be pulled apart to use."
3,A very pedestrian book,"When I heard about this book, I was excited, since Sheckley is one of the few writers who writes decent comedic science fiction.His foray into mystery is not a successful one. This book wasn't good or bad, it was just ordinary. There was nothing really remarkable about the plot or the characters, and I found it hard to get into this book.If you want my opinion, stick to Sheckley's scifi stuff."
1,A poor representation of current styles,"I have several of Charles Randalls' prior books dating to 1994. Sadly, this one did not deviate much from their content. This is a very poor representation of current trends and styles. Most photographs looked as though they were taken in the 80s' and 90s'As an interior designer, I am always looking for ways to offer my clients new and fresh ideas for their windows. I would be embarrassed to bring this book as an aide in selection of window treatment styles"
5,Broad sweep of military-technological history,"This is a collection of three separate documentary series tracing the modern evolution of the battleship, mobile armored vehicles, and the warplane. It's focus is entirely on relatively recent history: the battleship documentary goes back to the Battle of Trafalgar, but no further. But it is very well done, and does a fantastic job of helping the viewer to see the main trends in the development of nuclear technology, and why it developed the way it did. It includes recent developments like the Virginia-class SSN and the F-35."
3,His playing is genius but he is still a psychopath,Once again he proves to be a genius in his compositions and executions. To bad he needs a full time Psychiatrist for his years and years of issue. He never lets his mental issues get in the way of his playing and thats a good thing.
4,strong construction,"This is one of the few underwater housing for lumix cameras and fits to tz2 and tz3 only. The construction looks really tough and strong but this is my first underwater housing so I cannot compare it to other housings. Until now I used it for 4 dives and I should confirm it is water proof :) , I was satisfied. But once I left the camera under sunligth for 15 minutes before a dive and when I get into the cold water, I noticed the fog formation on the inner surface of the housing. But this was completely my fault and in the manual this was mentioned as a ""not to do"". After 15 minutes it was over. The camera TZ3 itself is a very good choice for amateur underwater photography since it has:-10x zoom-wide screen-image stabilizationAnd this housing is a must to benefit from these attributes."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book, thinking I would learn so much more about the tombs and their owners. It just scrapes the service with what it offers on Woodlawn. No pictures, and very little information. I believe it could have been better written and with more detailed pictures to give a more rounded glimpse of Woodlawn. The cemetery is just beautiful, and walking through it gives one a sense of calm. Sad this book did not give the full history of its making, of its great members or the most elaborate and expensive tombs in America. This book does not give Woodlawn Justice."
1,Review,Some of this book is helpful but for the most part I felt like it was a waste of time. There are numerous type-Os that are sometimes confusing and misleading. Some major concepts are not explained at all. The chapter ending projects are pretty much all the same. Most only use one or two of the new functions covered and ignore the rest. The code is written in double-spaced sections broken up by paragraphs of explanation. Then the whole example is written out again double-spaced. The material could have been presented in a way that is just as understandable in 100 less pages. It seems like a written assignment done over the weekend by a lazy student with an assignment of X-pages due on Monday.
3,Great for the price,"at $200US this is great for the price. i missed image stabalization but during the day with a fast aperture and shutter its not a deal breaker. I'd also sugget shooting with a mono/tripod for extra stability.The front of the barrel rotates on focus making polarized filters tricky to use.The focus ring turns very easily, almost too easily making manual focussing hard at times especially in macro mode. But who manual focuses anyway right??The hood fits loose especially when reversed for storage so i found it slips off at times.Otherwise, feels well constructed and works well.oh ye, this is mag 1:2 so not true macro"
5,great begining book,This book was in very good shape and arrived quickly. Bought it for my grandson and he was READING the book after about 30 minutes of help. Dick and Jane was what I began reading with and I am a very good reader. My own children used the new methods and are not good readers. Lets go back to Dick and Jane.
4,Will purchase again!,My ganddaughter will begin kindergarten this coming fall and is ready to read. She picked up this book and was reading right away. I was concerned about the dated pictures but that didn't seem to bother her at all.
5,Great Little Books,"We are homeschooling and always looking for new books to interest our kids. These are books I remember when I was a kid and enjoyed them. One does not need to be an ""expert"" to teach their children to read. We know several people with PHD's and some of which seem to have stopped learning once they left school. Some are very close minded. It's really okay to be different! Kuddos to those out there that are interested in being a part of their childs learning experience whether Homeschooling or not. In the end the children will be better for it. These are great books. I was amazed to see that they are actually still in print!"
1,Broke on first use,One of the two screws on head plastic piece flew off on my first use. The plastic cover was half open and the spring under the cover was sticking out.It
1,Makes a nice breaker bar - no good as a torque wrench,"I bought this new October 2008, but the anticipated project didn't happen and it sat unused in its case until today - about 18 months after purchasing. No damage, rust or anything - truly like new (because it is) - but it flat-out doesn't work. Instructions say if unused for a while, to use at low torque settings to circulate internal lubricant. But even at the lowest settings it accepts, it simply never clicks over. I overtorqued a motorcycle axle bolt by about 250% before realizing the wrench didn't work - got out a manual torque measure and found out.The price is low for a reason - and other reviews are mostly on the low side, so I'd avoid and spend a bit more."
2,Bought this along with EEPC 1000HE,"I bought this ram for an upgrade on the asus 1000HE from 1gb to 2gb to maximize the ram. Although I am sure it is good ram I cannot recommend it for the 1000HE. It worked but it would seem to studder whenever opening programs. It would take a few seconds to open programs. Like it would pause before finally realizing I pressed the button to open the program. This goes for just pressing the start button or opening web browser, folders, just everything.So I reinstalled the original ram that came with the 1000HE which was 1gb and all the studdering went away.So if you plan on getting this ram for any mini-laptop you might want to try a different brand."
5,Max Your Memory,You can't have too much memory...always max it. Always make sure you order the correct memory. Worked right out of the box.
5,Memory Card speeds processing,"This card was quite simple to install into my new Samsung Netbook. It increased processing speed, and allows me to run the entire MS Office 2007 application."
5,"Quick shipment,","Received this item very quickly, was very easy to install and worked exactly as promoted."
1,what happened?,"I ordered eBay memory and it took like three days. When it could have been simply mailed, to get the box to me here in Oklahoma City, took almost 2 weeks--what happened?"
1,wrong RAM for my asus eee pc 1001p,"Do NOT get this RAM for your Asus eee pc 1001P. It works great at first. Then the computer doesn't shut off properly, drains out my battery.It is a great product for the price but make sure you get the right one. Now, if only someone could tell me which is the right one to get...."
5,Added memory for Netbook,This module was easy to install and works 100% with my new Netbook. Very good value.
5,Thanks for the Memory,"Installed into: Asus 1000 HE Netbook & Asus 1002 HA Netbook. In both cases the memory worked great, detected after one check, and was easy to install."
5,perfect for Panasonic Toughbook W8,This memory installs perfectly in Panasonic Toughbook W8. Stock memory in system is 2 GB. This brings it up to 3.4 GB ( likely XP RAM limit ).
2,not for Macbook Pro mid 2008,"Although I thought this was the same memory RAM advised by Crucial.com memory scan (http://www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=3FD44F41A5CA7304), I guess this was not the same one recommended by their site.As soon as I installed the RAM, my laptop makes two beep noises on the initial startup, which means that the RAM was incompatible to my laptop.I am returning this, and will try buying Crucial RAM from their site.This is my computer spec of my Macbook Pro mid 2008:Model Name: MacBook ProModel Identifier: MacBookPro4,1Processor Name: Intel Core 2 DuoProcessor Speed: 2.5 GHzNumber Of Processors: 1Total Number Of Cores: 2L2 Cache: 6 MBBus Speed: 800 MHzBoot ROM Version: MBP41.00C1.B03SMC Version (system): 1.27f3"
3,Not for faint of heart,"I purchased the additional memory, but realized afterwards, I really didn't need it for the type of uses I will use the netbook for. With 1 gb of ram, that's plenty of memory. I also thought the Ram was easier to install than it is, but it basically requires the Acer Aspire to be taken apart to get under the keyboard to install. There are good videos on You Tube that walks you through the process, but I thought twice about taking on this project with a brand new netbook. In talking with Acer support, I also found out that if the user installs anything above and beyond how the netbook was delivered, you're basically at your own risk if something were to go wrong with the netbook, so I decided not to install it. I have no doubt, this additional memory card works very well, but I'm not willing to install it at this time because of the rqamifications and difficulty."
1,charged 37% to return an item.,I bought this for a computer I was getting. When the computer arrived broken I canceled the order for the computer and for the ram. When returning Amazon said it would charge me $5.00 to return it. That was fine. But somehow after that they tacked on another$10.00 in fees for returning the product. This was not stated when saying I would like to return the goods. And only gettying $25 back from a $40 order is bull****. That is almost a 50% restocking fee. I will not do business with this company again.
3,Was fried,"Had to send this one back, it was found outside in the sun by the Fed Ex guy, super smart. Not sure if that was what did it in but i installed it and got blackness, bad Ram. Sent it back and got 4GB instead from different product line."
4,An appetizer before the main course.,"This CD is an EP released by Sina and the boys a few months before the full length album. As it is it's sort of a teaser of things to come. All of the songs are very solid. There are some great remixes of caress (the rotersand version being very un-pzycho bitch like, but still a catchy little number). Overall the only complaint I have with this album is that there isn't very much cohesion between the tracks. some are lulling ambient sound scapes that lead into screamy noize. While I like both styles it just makes this album hard to listen to all the way through...its more like a mix CD or something. But I am very happy with this Disc and recomend it to anyone who is a fan of harder electronic music."
3,Good option if breastfeeding,I would rate this higher if it the bottles were easier to clean and if the blue inner nipple was more durable. I had to keep replacing the nipple because the inner nipple would get worn pretty quickly. This is a good bottle if you are breastfeeding and bottle feeding.
1,not recommended,"I bought these bottles because my baby is breast fed and will not take a bottle. i have tried all the bottles including nuk and other similar name brand bottles. She would not take none of them including this one. The nipple collapses very easy, so you are constantly taking the bottle in and out of the babys mouth."
1,Should have went with a different card,"This product was hard to install; had to try 3 times before it would work correctly. That would be short lived; would be playing a game (Sims2 w/exp packs) and all the sudden it would freeze for a second and it would go to a black screen with a message no input signal. I would have to cut the power and reboot. After about a month it started doing this when surfing the internet. Now, just after 3 months, your lucking if you get to play 5 minutes. I wish I would have waited and bought a better card. But,if I have to say something good, when it did work graphics was good."
4,ATI 9550 - A Capable yet low - power card.,"Pros - Decent performance. Very high resolution. Smooth video playback. Broad compatibility. DX9, DVI and SVHS capable. Supports Windows Vista. The low power consumption means the Heatsink needs no noisy and unreliable fan.Cons - Is an older design, doesn't support the latest games well. Not inexpensive.This is a GREAT video card for a Small Form Factor system (such as a Shuttle) where total power consumption and heat output are important factors. Pictures and Video are sharp and clear, and the included driver disk works trouble-free. Perfect for those that want a quiet system that runs cool and draws little power but still want decent videocard performance."
2,Yuck!,"After trying this card for a few days all I can say is YUCK to ATI. Stick with Nvidia if your a seriour gamer. On both my systems with the lastest drivers installed, this card had strange glitches when multitasking (chatting, surfing, etc) not only that but your could really tell a visual difference between this and the card rival (Geforce 6200 series). Another bother was when the driver CD was installed as complete, ATI put more junk on my system with their utilities then anything. Everything Windows Media Player does for the most part. The cards ok for the occasional gamer but not for serious ones (on a budget)."
2,Go with NVidia,"I got this card due to cost but also had limited choices at the local Circuit City store. Boy was this a mistake. I had to get a new video card to play the Elder Scrolls Oblivion game. This card barely made it run, and even, I had issues with the graphics and having my desktop settings screw up.What makes this such a poor choice overall however is the bloated software you get. I noticed it also will start up CTI.EXE on startup, then this will startup several copies of itself. I saw FOUR CTI.EXE running at the same time, gobbling up 64 MB of ram!! Since when does video drivers hot that up?!Settings are also tricky for a newbie to figure out, and my computer kept resetting displays as well, and I have only the one monitor. I admit I'm no huge gamer, and this sytem is also nto a gaming sytem, but geesh- this is the LAST time I buy anything from ATI."
4,great for outdoors fun,"Speedminton is so much fun, and a lot easier to set up then badminton. You can take this with you where ever you go, no nets to set up. The only downfall is if it's to windy then you really can't play, other then that it's great."
4,Good,"Very good alternative to Badminton in slight wind conditions. I suggest that you do not discard the lighted sticks, as you can use them when the winds are bit more."
4,A little over-advertized,"The game is definitely fun, especially if you play it on a tennis court. The birdie is smaller and flies faster than in traditional badminton games. Hitting the birdie and directing it to the right spot is easier than I anticipated, especially considering the small size of the racket. Once the game gets going, the enjoyment level is fairly high, but falls short of the promised thrill in the product promo texts. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that, in spite of all the hype and promises, the game is far from being wind resistant. A little better than badminton, but still can be ruined by anything stronger than a breeze. The ""wind ring"" is ineffective, feels more like a placebo.Overall, if you paid under $30 for this set, you probably are going to get your money's worth out of playing it. Try it, and expect it to be a fast version of badminton."
5,Speedminton !,What a great concept. Its four square and badminton combined. Very fast and very fun. Can't wait for spring. Barbecue and speedminton. Excellent!
3,BRAD VICKERS WAS HERE,"Not a bad c.d,but not a brilliant one.The price was quite high when i bought it so naturally i was a little dissapointed.I enjoy some of the tracks but some just dont quite hold the quality feel..."
2,Too Much Techno Remix,This Resident Evil soundtrack wasn't very good. I thought that it had far too much techno mix to it. It didn't even have the music I wanted and if it did I couldn't tell which one it was. The reason I gave it 2 stars was because some...I repeat some of the music was okay.
1,3 pairs of Aerosoles Sleekers,"I ordered three pairs of these shoes: black, red, brownALL three pairs arrived damaged - leather nicked, etc.This was the first time I had ever ordered through Amazom and probably won't ever do it again."
3,Partly disappointing,"I own many of Ms Norman's records, and she has just about the best classically trained voice around, but this record is very up and down. In short... her voice is overly classical for this type of music. M. Michel Legrand est genial... and his music makes this record."
5,CATASTROPHIC!,"THIS ALBUM HAS BROUGHT ME TO THE BRINK OF... I HAVE NO QUESTIONS, FOR AFTER HEARING THIS, ALL MY ANSWERS...this is the purpose of art-exhuming life"
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"First off, let me say that I have been a huge fan of Jessye Norman's since I heard her ""Countess"" in the Colin Davis recording of ""Marriage of Figaro"" for Philips & saw her live at the Metropolitan Opera House in many different roles. Her class and style and warmth combined with her extraordinary talent and unusual choice of repertoire make her one in a million. Now, let me say what a total disappointment this album is. Norman is just one of many ""serious"" singers who do not know how to sing easily and just ""let go."" Her over-enunciation of almost every single word becomes precious and because of the overly-lush arrangements, for the first time in my experience, Jessye Norman becomes a background singer--someone you'd hear in an elevator. The songs, themselves, by Michel Legrand, are simply high-class Muzak. The lyrics tend to be pretentious like ""When lonely feelings chill the meadows of your mind....."" or ""...the scent of rain..."" Legrand's piano playing is fine."
2,reconditioned?????,"I have used the same scale for several years until I dropped the display and broke it. This so called reconditioned scale lasted less than a month before it quit working. The display, which was NOT the original equipment worked with my old scale which allowed me to carry on. I would not buy anything these guys claim to be reconditioned."
2,Bad Cord Placement,"I bought this scale in August 2010. It is now the first week in October. The scale is rarely moved, however the cord has already worn through it's insulation and the wiring is broken."
1,Not for young children,Not a story I would ever read to my young kids. Much too dark and not something to be compared with any classic children's books. This is the type of story that could easily invite nightmares and not sweet dreams.
5,Until E.E. Doc Smith gets a proper release on film...,I heartily endorse this Space Opera!Big Space Battles with Star Ships! Goliath beings tearing the ether and anyone foolish enough to wander within their conflict! Their battles lasting for DAYS without pause!! Chaste love affairs! The only thing missing is swords and hammers in Zero Inertia Mano O Mano!!!I Love this series for letting me see what I read back in the day.
2,dougv,"The film starts out OK, but it's slow moving and the cinematography is low budget.It shows church leaders who are critical and unwilling to allow the youth group leader tohelp the teens deal with important issues in our society.The ending is a real disappointment and ruins the story. It lets the church leadersstay critical and unaccepting. God would be against such leaders.The film isn't worth seeing."
5,Best Book I've seen on Auras,"This book is a no-nonsense guide to get anyone started seeing auras themselves. I read auras for a living and have found a lot of other books on this subject are limited to a certain perspective only. Ted Andrews clearly knows what he's talking about. No misinformation here. Do the exercises in here. They really work. I have used them in workshops. It is a simple process really and as such should be presented that way. Many people who come to see me want to be psychic too. Well this book will help you do that. Everyone sees auras, they just don't realize where to concentrate their thinking. If you've ever met someone you liked or didn't like instantly, you've made that decision based on an aura. This book is inexpensive and a great tool. You owe it to yourself to try these things. You will be a better judge of people if you develop these skills."
4,Quick and easy read,This is a great starter book for someone who does not have a great deal of experience in metaphysics. The book was downloaded to Kindle so it was immediate.
5,Only did the exercises once so far...,"Okay, so this is actually my first time ever writing a review on Amazon. But after getting this book, I just had too. I've only done the exercises once so far, but I'm already getting the results that the book says I should get sooner or later. It's actually really amazing. Especially when I was looking at the colored circles clockwise and there was color moving with my eyes. I was also able to see the aura around my hand, though I wasn't able to see the colors yet. However, I'm sure I'll be able to see the colors soon enough. After that, I'll start working on seeing other people's auras. This book is truly amazing. Though I've always been good at the daydream stare, I'm sure anyone who actually gives the exercises a chance when start seeing auras."
4,"Thorough and empirical, an amazing find.","Lutzer appeals to many audiences, just about every religious background has a reference here. He begins with his purpose in writing this work, to answer fundamental questions that anyone might have, such as ""Is there a God?"" and ""Doesn't science contradict the Bible?"" He also explains important concepts in understanding the Bible, like dual authorship (God and man), and way to interpret prophesy. I recommend this book for anyone searching to find truth behind the Scriptures."
3,FLAWED KINDLE EDTION,"This was the second book I purchased for my Kindle. I consider this book by Dr. Lutzer to be excellent, and am a big fan of his. But the electronic Kindle edtion proved to be less than satisfactory. Every bulleted list included in the text was clipped off on the right hand margin, and to date I have found no trick to view the portions that could not be read. I tried changing the font size, and that helped somewhat, but it did not solve the problem totally and was tough vision-wise. I thought at first that it was a mistake on only the first few bulleted lists, but as I went on through the text, it was present thoughout. It is a shame, for it is an excellent book by Lutzer and very helpful. I will have to purchase the print edtion, since I need this book in its entirety."
4,7 Reasons You Can Trust the Bible,I found the book very helpful. Especially interesting was the difference between Protestantism & Catholocism with regards to interpretation of the scriptures.
4,"Fun and captivating, but short lived.","I am a fan of most Monopoly games, and had played this originally thru the Real Player Real Arcade player. I found it here in a combo pack with Zoo Tycoon and because of the low price figured it was worth it. I really enjoy the gameplay as it's fast paced and simple, and the competitive aspects are good, too. I like the progression of music, cars, and buildings you can create as time progresses, but do wish there were more options, still. The only bad thing to say is that the game is a bit short if you play pretty heavy. After finishing, you can of course go back and play on higher difficulty levels and play freeform games to get some more play out of it. All in all, totally worth the buy, and a great way to spend a lazy, rainy day."
5,Inpirational,Its such a wonderful book. I am a fashion major and its nice to see other people's fashion illustration. I have struggled to find my own drawing style and this book has definately helped open my creativity.
4,Inspirational,"I think that this album is really inspiring. However, I've always hated and will always hate interludes, as I think they're just a way of making up the number of tracks. This album has about 2 or 3 of them. Putting that aside however, the album is quite good, and I believe that Kirk's music inspires others as it has inspired me, and I hope that he continues to praise God in his music. There are alot of people that think his music is worldly. Well, one must remember that music evolves, and if we wish to reach alot of young people out there, it'll be most difficult to do that with the old boring hymns that most of us sang as children."
2,Change is not always good!!!,"Having been a fan of Kirk Franklin from day one, I was very dissappointed with the latest project. As an artist myself, I understand the desire to continually change and evolve in the craft, however, I think that this project has veered too much to the left. Kirk Franklin is an amazing artist;however, this new project falls short in my eyes. I miss the funkiness of the Revolution project and the soul stirring songs on the Whatcha Lookin For project."
1,Not for critical thinkers.,"Pure, right-wing, paranoid, nonsense. There's a reason this ""stuff"" is never reported in the mainstream media. It can't withstand scrutiny."
3,So bad it's almost good,"The title of this set of Episodes should be ""Carry On Clantons"".Yes, this is the worst Dr. Who episode ever. That makes it an absolute must-have for serious Dr. Who collectors. The entire episode is played for laughs, and probably seems funnier to a British viewer than to an American. Listen closely to the lyrics of the background ballad - it's a ""bang on"" parody of 50's America western background ballads (think ""High Noon"" or ""Gunfight at the OK Corral""). The cowboys with British accents are hilarious.ON the downside, there is very little actual conflict or suspense in the story line, and too many of the jokes are predictable or downright lame, at least to an American sense of humor. But for the Dr. Who enthusiast, it's worth at least one viewing."
1,I only finished this because it is Doctor Who,"Wow! What a piece of crap. The script is flat, the acting is unbelievably horrid (oh the accents!), and the ""Last Chance"" song is like a lingering fart in the room that just won't go away (in episode 2 even the characters are complaining how they want a different song). As usual, the writers didn't know what to do with Dodo, but she is particularly lame here. She must have Stockholm Syndrome, because she's doing her captor's hair and runs after them after they leave her to herself. Character's actions are absurd, but not in a particularly entertaining way, rather they just kind of do stuff because the writers need something to happen.I'm a big Doctor Who fan, and there is no way that I would have made it to the end of this without feeling a strange urge to see every Who episode. That said, it isn't the worst (that's Delta and the Bannerman), but it might make my bottom 10 and those bottom 10 are stiff competition."
5,What're You Gonna Do,"when you are a highly talented, creative singer like Kate McGarry, who can knock out sensitive, unique covers of items like ""Gypsy in My Soul,"" ""This is Always,"" ""Get Out of Town,"" or ""Oceano""--and are about as far from a household name as you get? Kate McGarry is terrific--and so are Kendra Shank, Barbara Sfraga, and Jackie Allen. These four are an example of what a glut of terrific women singers are out there--and a relative surfeit of talented male singers. Go figure. Here's hoping that at least one of them breaks out...."
4,Great Gadget,"I have 2007 new style Silverado 2500HD 6.0L. Bought the Edge Evolution for towing, and with 93+ octane it is great. Below that not much difference from stock in the towing RPM range.Had for almost a year whem it suddenly went bad and screwed up my engine computer. After being assured there was not likely anything wrong with the programmer and spending a half hour 2x on phone at computer trying to upgrade it as a ""fix"" I finally said enough and told them I was sending it back. Well...they tested it and sure enough the mother board had a bad part. After I had to take my truck in to dealer to have 2 modules flashed again. But I will say Edge stands behind their products and sent me a cheque to cover the dealer cost of flashiong the computer. THAT is good custmer support. I find the guages very useful for towing to actually show exact engine and tranny oil temps, and engine load when towing my fifth wheel."
1,Ugh! Terrible!,"I recieved this as a gift back when I was in 9th grade, when the movie (which was also stupid)first came out. Why I wanted it, I have no clue. All the songs are light, mindless teenybop pop (most of these 'artists' arent even around anymore, btw). I can see an elementary kid liking this stuff, but not anyone over 13.The only 3 songs worth mentioning, and that would qualify as hits:1. There She Goes ~ Sixpence None the Richer - A pretty good cover of the pretty good La's song. This song saves the album from being utterly worthless. Although the song is also on their self-titled album. So Sixpence fans, just buy that.2. Another Dumb Blonde ~ Hoku - Supposedly this girl is a serious singer songwriter, but you'd never know it by hearing this. As far as I know, this was a fairly big hit on the radio. This song will make most guys want to puke.3. Waiting For a Girl Like You ~ Foreigner - This is a classic pop song that most people will like."
3,Super Reader,"Also known as the Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming. When the Fireclown arrives at The End of Time, any problems that the residents there have with boredom and ennui will not be lasting for very long at all.One thing the Fireclown is very good at is shaking things up and changing the status quo. This is particularly true in the case of the staid Miss Mavis Ming."
5,Nuggets of Golden Information,"This book is chocked full of nuggets of great information. Internet savvy, Ms. Leal shares ideas to promote your book on the web and to draw more visitors to your site. She includes helpful articles written by successful authors on myriad proven ways to promote books. Each chapter concludes with valuable resource names/websites/contact details. Reading this book taught and inspired me. I recommend You Can Market Your Book to students in my ""How to Get Published"" class as well as any aspiring or published author.For childrearing help, see The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"
5,Great Book,I was very impressed with the writing of this book. It will help many people who may be suffering with an illness. It encourages you to keep going and never give up. Michelle D.
3,This seems to be more about club moves...,"...but, she does break down moves better than other DVDs I've seen. The geometric patterns used to describe hip movement along with where your knee should be swinging/pointing as your hip moves round is quite helpful.Even if I was looking for club moves, this probably wouldn't be the DVD for me. The thing I don't like about this is video is the lack of practice and lack of ""doing it with you"" feeling you get in most exercise videos. It's like I am suppose to watch her, stop the video and pratice on my own.Something about her comes across as very, very practiced more than sensual. Maybe I just like the more authentic, traditional feeling belly dance DVDs. I use this DVD to supplement another belly dance DVD I have."
4,Presto! You can bellydance,"This is more like a fast demonstration of certain belly dance moves than it is a crash course in belly dancing. There aren't enough repetitions for beginners. If you are truly a beginner, Neon's You Can Bellydance! is much more approachable because it moves at a reasonable pace and you even learn two fun routines. This DVD seems to be geared toward teaching some moves really fast. I suppose if you just wanted to quickly get a belly dance overview and pick up a few moves, this would work. But if you really want to have fun with belly dance, get some of Neon's other DVDs. She has quite a few out there that are much more in-depth, such as Sensual Goddess - Bellydance for Total Beginners. Learning belly dance can be a great way to get a low-impact workout."
5,Perfect for the dancefloor,"This is an excellently produced DVD which makes use of digital techniques together with the elegant Neon herself to teach a wide variety of belly-dancing movements. Taking belly dancing out of what can be a rather traditional and old fashioned community and thrusting it into 21st century techno culture is an inspired strategy. Anyone who enjoys dancing at parties (not just raves and clubs) will learn something beneficial from this DVD, and quickly too! I look forward to seeing more from Neon in this series and, dare I say, my husband would like to know if there's likely to be one for men too!"
2,Clamps the palm of your hand,Bought this as a gift to replace my parents' ancient nut cracker. On their first try they both painfully clamped their palms. Nice design but looks like the ancient nut cracker is staying.
4,great product,Good item works great gives the user a large scale of torque settings to dial into... needs better instructions for the people that are unfamiliar with using this.
1,What a waste.,Nearly $200 and I got a teakettle with a broken whistler and lid that nearly takes a sledge hammer to put on and take off. Total piece of cr-p.
1,Not what I expected,"I purchase a lot of educational videos on photography and Photoshop, but this one was not at all what I expected. It has little, if any, educational value. Instead, the video shows photos taken by French photographers with commentary (in French). Don't buy this as an educational video."
5,Excellent 1990 Release (May Have Been Their Last),"The 1990 edition of this long lived group featured: Armond Morales, David Will, Ron Hemby and David Robertson. This is an excellent disc in a catchy straight ahead CCM vein, with the expected excellent vocals and harmonies. Any Imperials fan should also have this one.Songs are:Big Ball TurningLove Can Make It HappenCome Into My LifeOriginal LoveI Will Follow YouIt's Raining AgainIt's Gonna Be AlrightLove's Still Changing HeartsCome Let Us WorshipGoin' AwayPlatinum Medley"
4,This is the great Classic of Kung fu cinema,"This is one of the greatest kung fu films in history. Gordon Liu is directed by his uncle Liu Chia Liang, in a Hung Gar like mode Kung Fu film with great action!"
5,Great Show,"I really loved Justice League Unlimited, Batman (Beyond, etc.), and all the other animated superhero shows, so finding out about Young Justice was great. The characters have depth and I feel like Season 1 has only barely revealed to us how intense things are going to get!"
1,Ugly fluff,"Unlike the other negative reviews, I didn't mind this wasn't done in one stint. I respect the fact that the woman has a real job, and needs to make money.But there was so much else to dislike.First, what kind of kayaking instructor doesn't look into the wind directions?Second, what is with analogies for how red something...Jen, I'm a guy, I don't know how red menstral blood...duh!!Third...I hated her taking rides when the going got tough.Fourth...the last few chapters had more fluff, and less kayaking data...meaning she wanted to extend it a few more pages.This is a boring read."
4,Super crocodile movie,"One of the best Croc's movie for collector. Same quality than Black water or Lake Placid 1. Good quality of image, actor andmusic! I like!"
4,much better than kit,i have a canon rebel xt. this is much better than the kit lens! love the focus ring. it's pretty loud at times.
4,Extreamly useful lens,This lens is a workhorse. It can handle everything but telephoto reasonably well. Its been my primary lens since I got it. The build quality is pretty sturdy tho not as good as metal.If 17-70 is the focal length you are looking for you could do a lot worse than this.
4,gift item,bought this item for a gift & from what I have been told it is great music to listen to over and over
4,Great Item,The CD was in perfect condition when I received it. It has great quality music and I am very pleased with this purchase.
4,pretty decent,with a nice mix of uptempo R&B and Rap as well. The Step Up soundtrack does what it needs to for the most part and that is getting folks up and dance. There's more slower songs towards the end of the cd but they are pretty good as well. Only 2 songs on the cd that i didnt really care for myself otherwise this was a pretty solid purchase.
3,entertaining,"Saw the movie first, making sure the music was up to par. Yes I found the soundtrack entertaining. Rapping is not one of my favorite music collection, but i'm very universal what ever turn you on. There were many songs that caught my attention, one of my favorite was kelis "" 80s Joint"", alot of energy with this song, you just want to get up and dance. another song is drew sidora "" til the dawn "", another up beat tune. There are variation of songs to satisfy your taste. I enjoy the soundtrack."
1,Noise not music,"Awful, ugly noises, ugly cover, i can go on and on but there are not enough words to describe it.. A friend of mine thought he like the one song but even that song was not at all how he remembered it!"
5,Wow!,"The author provides much to think about regarding our way of life and how we got here. We take for granted the civilizing process Harris describes in this book. There are practical reasons why we in the West don't kill our neighbors and fellow citizens. Harris carefully teaches us what it takes to lead the rest of the world to a civil life among those one disagrees with, while defending ourselves when necessary from ruthless enemies. The only thing I would have liked more of was to read the author's thoughts on the development of Christianity from its Judaic roots and its effect on the civilizing process.Harris's strong, clear writing styles lays the foundation for understanding these essential truths. It seems nearly every page contains an ""A-Ha"" moment. If you seek clarity about the fundamentals of how our crazy world works, this book is a most thought-provoking and worthwhile read. I recommend it without reservation."
1,This card DOES NOT have a DVI connector,"Despite what the product description says, the product I received DOES NOT have a DVI connector. I am returning it, as this is specifically what I bought it for."
2,Don't market this as a traditional Tarantella CD for wedding,"I bought what must have been a dozen CDs that were supposed to be appropriate for an Italian wedding (my Granddaughter was getting married). I purchased this one upon recommendation of the virtual italia website. What a mistake. There was really no way we could play this music at a traditional Italian wedding reception. While it may have some interest for historians interested in the development of the tarantella, it is definitely NOT for musical entertainment at any social Italian American functions. Future buyers should know this. Thanks for allowing me to comment."
1,Stay away if you have a two door car,I drive a '03 Sunfire and this car seat fits HORRIBLE in it! It's nothing but a 100% pain and so I am returning it. I haven't had it for over 24 hours and I already want to throw it out window. It's hard to tighten the straps because the car seat in rear facing is jammed into the seat. Even the firemen that put it in for me told me to take it back because it was not going to make me happy. Sure enough they were right.
3,bad straps,"there is one thing that bothers me: the straps twist very easily - and sometimes it is twisted behing the chasir, so you won't notice it until you try to tighten the buckle. It's a real pain to have to untwist the straps every other time that I have to go for a car ride."
3,Recalled =(,"Bought it, but decided to return it because of the recall. It was very nicely padded and seemed like it would have been great, but the recall freaked me out so I returned it and got a Marathon instead. Britax.com website has info on the recall. Not a big deal, but enough to put doubts in my head."
3,Caution: Only Rear-Faces to 33lbs,"Overall, the Decathlon is a solid seat from Britax, with great covers, easy-to-use adjusting features, and great installation gadgets like belt lockoffs and push-button LATCH connectors.BUT -- this seat only rear-faces to 33lbs. Amazon's product info section has it WRONG. PLEASE be forewarned if you are looking to buy this seat and keep your child rear-facing as long as possible -- this seat won't be the right one for you if so. Consider the newer model Boulevards, Marathons, or Roundabouts, or a non-Britax option.[...]"
4,Good car seat,"This car seat is very comfortable and very secure. The only drawbacks I've noticed are how difficult it is to tighten and release every time we put our baby in it and that it is a very big car seat. We read other reviews that it fits fine in their sedan car... Not so much. It fits in my Passat, but the front passenger's knees hit the dashboard. Maybe when we turn it to forward facing it will be better, but it's not very comfortable for passengers in my car right now. I'm not terribly bothered by that since our other car is an SUV and when we go out as a family we go in that one, but if you only have a sedan car it might be more of a problem. I consider both of these things minor and would buy this car seat again. Our daughter seems very comfortable with all the side pillows and securely snugged in."
4,!Que Hombres Guapisimos!,"This book could have been called ""The Ultimate Book of Famous Hispanic Men."" Almost everyone is here (except John Leguizamos, surprisingly). They show the living and deceased, young men and viejos, actors and politicians, etc. This book will make you think very expansively about who is the Latino Man. It includes photos of Sammy Davis Jr. (wasn't he black?), Holly Woodlawn (wasn't ""she"" white and ""female""?) and Freddy Prinze Jr. (isn't he white American?). The authors provide very little analytical insight to the photo spread and unfortunately almost everyone is fully clad here. Still, it's a cute little edition for anyone's Latino Studies collection. (And yes: most of the men in it are killer hot!)"
1,"Great album, poorly manufactured",Received this cd from someone other than the seller (due to availability?) and eagerly rushed to play it. It wouldn't. Worst cd ever - sent it back 10 days ago. Have heard nothing since. Feelin' alright? Not me.
2,Not the Very Best!,"I was very disappointed with this CD and cannot recommend it. With the exception of 2 or 3 songs, I found the selections to be far from the best that Traffic has to offer."
3,Sensitive and expressionistic,"Unlike Clara Rockmore's ""The Art of the Theramin"", this is an album written exclusively for the theramin instrument.The theramin has great dynamic and soprano range. In some of the pieces, the theramin is set against a human soprano. To exhillarating effect.The theramin presages the Moog synthesizer.If you had ONE theramin album, it would not be this one.Choose the Clara Rockmore version, instead."
4,Everything Zen,This is a fun little calendar. Don't take it to seriously and it will brighten your day now and then.
1,Pay what you get,"The handles that are glued, were apart, so As soon as I opened, I had to fasten them with electrical wires! The whole unit is built very cheap. I am using the unit after some repairs, waitng to be all apart to get a better unit next time. Don't recommend it."
4,Pro Smoke Glasses,"Really loved these Safety Glasses use them for work (construction) and driving around. Always get complements from the crew and questions about how I got them. Usually these glasses are given away by Dewalt dealers after you buy a expencive tool. Great to find them on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Buy more than 2 or 3, the work crew and friends will want them, plus you will want a pair within reach while driving."
4,Great lens for the price,"I use this on my SD14 for infrared photography. I use a Canon 50d for standard photography. The lens has a great range and is sharp and relatively fast. I really think this lens is the quality of the EX series. And it if it were 2.8 at 70mm it would probably be designated as one. Excellent build, Very sharp, Fast autofocus for not being HSM. Very much like the 18-50mm 2.8 ex lens."
2,"Rename it to ""RedSox, Yankees and Giants""","I've always trusted Ken Burns to make a good, fair documentary. Now I have to wonder if I was mislead on those other documentaries as well. I wasn't around for most of those times. I took his word for it. If his work was as slanted and narrow-focused as this work, then I probably was mislead. I remember the last 20 years of baseball and he blew it. Excruciating detail of every Boston-Yankees game and complete omission of other important baseball events. How do you talk about baseball in the last 10 years and not even mention Albert Pujols--ridiculous. But then again--that pretty much covers this piece of work."
3,"East Side, West Side","This is a short review of Ken Burns Baseball: The Tenth Inning which Ithought was fairly good but once again the coverage seems to stopwhen the Boston Red Sox finally beat the Yankees and win the 2004American League Pennant.Baseball: The Tenth Inning was supposed to cover MLB up to 2010,or so it was advertised. Instead, the actual baseball part came up to2004 and then we got another half hour of the Barry Bonds steroidssoap opera. Good thing that there weren't any pennant races andWorld Series beyond 2004, otherwise we might've missed some excitingbaseball, which is what this was supposed to be all about.Much of Ken Burns' crew usual documentary skill is present in thissegment of Baseball but so is much of the apparently unknowing geographical/socialogical emphasis, which is a shameful waste.I was hoping for more, much more.Three Stars"
3,delightful,Paul Zindel is wonderful at making people not be able to put his books down. This is the first Paul Zindel book I've read but I'm sure it won't be the last. The way he interacts the people with eachother is amazing!
4,MORE LORDS,"I liked this one because they finally introduce another Time Lord--and not a whinny one like Susan was. (And like Donna Noble says, ""What do you call a female Time Lord?"") Anyway, one of the better episodes. It contains episodes 36-39 of season two to create story 17."
4,A good choice,"You don't need to go to France for an excellent CD of French Christmas carols since Les Petits Chanteurs du Mont-Royal (Quebec) made a very good CD of traditional carols north of the Border in Canada. This CD contains most of the traditional French carols which are sung in a traditional manner. This is important since ""Un flambeau, Jeanette Isabella"" (""Bring a torch, Jeanette Isabella"") has become a staple of the ""New Age"" music movement. The performance is pretty straight forward and not sentimental or done in a manner which will age it. Being timeless is significant in my opinion for an album of carols. The samples here give a good idea of how the album sounds. Another point in Adeste Fidelis's favor is that it is not an album where familiar English carols are being sung in French. ""Les Anges dans nos Campagnes"" is being heard here in it's original French version. I think that you will enjoy Adeste Fidelis for years to come."
2,tiny tiny book....,I expected activities that don't require a lot of preparation or set up. This is not that book...and it's tiny. I don't think I'll be referring to this book very often but returning it seemed like a waste since it was only $3.98.
1,Rip off,"Nice music but pointless second release. What next? Deluxe edition, 2 CDs, five more songs? No end to greed in sight is there."
4,Ha! Mine's longer since I was patient!,"We had to run a bunch of family errands on Saturday with Springsteen's Seeger Sessions in the car. The kids loved it. I guess I've raised them right as they recognized most of the songs. There are no bad versions of Erie Canal to the ears of my back seat.Also good, [...]daughter sang along with Bring `Em Home. Then, lacking a catchy slogan in the next track, made up her own lyrics about a ""pretty princess.""Myself, I found the Boss' vocals often a bit affected for such simple material, his basic rock shout would have worked fine. Great band, though."
1,Buy the sixth edition if you can.,"I bought the seventh edition because it was required for a class. I borrowed the sixth edition from a friend that took the class a few years ago and was floored by the differences. The seventh edition is exactly the same, except they removed some entire sections, removed some very useful examples and information from some other sections, and rearranged some problems and some section numbers to make the sixth edition unusable for homework assignments.If you can get a key that tells you which sections and problems correspond between the two editions, or you are just buying the book as a reference, get the sixth edition (significantly cheaper and better).I am constantly appalled by the practices of these text book publishers. They charge outrageous amounts for the books, make easy and unnecessary changes, release a new edition and force students to buy the new ones so they can make more money."
4,"A bit out of date, but still the gold standard.","While this is still the best book on IEC 61131, it is getting old and out of date. The standard change numbers years ago. Several versions of the standard have been released since this version came out. The author's book on 61499 is newer book on Function blocks and is a good companion book."
5,"Simple, portable and sturdy","After having a rotten experience with the ""On Stage XCG4"" stand, I decided to fork up a few more dollars for something that was not designed by a half-wit. This stand is everything you would expect and more. I have a robot vaccuum cleaner that pushes it around and his hell-bent on tipping it over but the guitar still stays secure!"
1,Never received it,"I ordered this film and it never showed up. I finally contacted the seller and they issued a refund. I then saw it uncut on TV and am glad I didn't buy it, even though it had been highly reviewed and about and important character from WW2 I didn't like the film."
3,Interesting concept; lame ending,"This book has some riveting concepts: justice as a being who shows up in court, prosecutors who do thier own investigations, and an affectionate and protective but non-romantic relationship between work partners. It kept my attention until near the end when it became a major letdown. It seemed like it was finished way to fast, without a real good explanation of why it was ending that way. In fact, when I finished the last page, my main response was ""Huh?"" It seemed like Duane just wanted to finish it to meet a deadline, instead of taking the time to carry the extreme characterization and detail to the end for a longer but much more coherent novel. I was rather disappointed."
3,they could have done better!,"i would have given this album a 1 star ,but for i got your number,read all about it i gave it 3. i mean, John James sounds like a girl. AND some of the songs are corny! buy this not!!"
2,A slow show with a lame ending.,"This show had lots of potential in the beginning, but it switches which character it focus's on. This makes it really hard care about any of the characters, since you hardly spend anytime with the characters.This show also suffers from having completely pointless episodes that in no way relate to the story. The main story arc is very good, it's just that they don't focus on it enough.This show has an interesting art style, and it always pleases the eyes.The main complaint I have with this show is the super lame ending. With all it's build up and skills gained, the day is saved by something you could read off a cereal box."
1,"Bad, bad, bad!","This is a worthless product. The wire broke while attempting the first slice. A replacement wire broke during replacement. Do *not* buy this product. I rate this product zero stars, but the program won't accept that."
1,Useless,The wire is not taut enough to slice cold or warm cheese. Keep looking and bypass this one. Pay attention to the reviews.
4,A worthy tome...,"An excellent abbreviated edition of a best-selling cookbook in Poland, the more exotic recipes (e.g. peacock brains 21 different ways...) pared out in favor of the classics, such as Pierogi, golabki (cabbage rolls), barcz (borsht), and bigos (hunter-style soup).While the book is on the whole quite strong, there are no pictures, which doesn't bother me much, but I am disappointed that the book entirely lacks a section on Polish baking, which is the only reason why the book didn't get 5 stars from me.Don't let these trivialities keep you from picking up this bargain book!"
4,Good reference for homemade Polish food,"Having grown up eating potatoes, kielbasa and sourkraut there are tons of recipes in this book that tailor to everyone's taste. There is a bigos recipe for each type of meat and they're all pretty accurate. It's tough to write a book on things your Mom or Grandmom makes without measuring so I think the authors have done a good job."
5,It's paprika and it's smokey,The product arrived very quickly. It's very smokey and it tastes like paprika. Not much to say about smoked paprika. It is what it says it is.
1,THE MOST STUPID MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER WATCHED,"This movie should be sold under comedy section. Scenario was written on false propaganda and false historical information. Nor Irish men or English man are part Arabs, Arabs must be daydreaming...Genetically %95 of the Irishmen and 70% of the Englishmen have ancestors from Central Asia. If there happened to be blue eyed aliens landed on earth, that part of the world should be Russia or Scandinavia not Middle East!"
2,Underwhelmed,"Sad. That pretty well sums up the whole experience. The show had a cast with potential. A half-way decent plot. Nice film quality in terms of shots and technique. However, the acting was abysmal from those who you would expect the most...a few of the underlings do a decent job. The plot drags on too long, and the conclusion is too vague and abrupt. You keep watching hoping that surely it will get better, and you really want it to do so. However, you feel like you have completely wasted far too much time and emotion when you finish. There is bound to be something better you could watch."
1,Does not work with older intel chipsets,"I have a Dell Precision 650. Its an ok machine with 2 Pentium Xeon CPUs with 4Gigs of memory. This is all on Intel E7505 chipset motherboard.Once I put this graphics card in. The screen went blank. And the beep code from them chipset told me that card is not compatible. This can be expected from newer AMD chipsets.I returned it back to Amazon. If you are running Intel chipsets and buying Radeon GPUs, make sure that AMD lists your chipset as compatible."
4,SWEET,"A fantastic next level to Gandalf's Beat Machine, you can definitely see Eligh's musical progression and expansion. Good for relaxing late night or bumping on the street. A must for any beat junkie"
3,My review on Nambul,"what I thought about this book is that is wasn't that bad.Its cool on how it has a lot of action, like urban violence explodes onto the streets and when Hae-Sung murders the leader of a Yakuza boss on the streets of Tokyo."
2,Very disappointing,After hearing what a classic this was supposed to be I was shocked at how weak this album turned out to be. It definitely doesn't sound like the second album and that's not a good thing.
2,mediocre,"Disappointing to one sense I was expecting much more, especially after the excellent vol.9. To me it stands somewhere between vol.1 and vol.8 (which are the less breathtaking)."
2,Not good,"I can't understand how you guys can listen this to chill out.When I listen any of the track of this CD for one minute i start to get angry because all are the same... as far as i know the only CD from this series that worth the money is the ""Best of Cafe del Mar""... it's a good 2CD compilation of Padilla's best music.... the rest its just the same!.... don't waste your money!..."
2,dissapointment...,"I'm pretty dissapointed.it seems that volume 10 had lost contact with the special emotionally charged sound,that was caracteristic to this compilation until two years ago.I felt on volume 9,that something is wrong,though I really liked it.it was different than the previous,it had its own personality,just that I wouldn't called it cafe del mar.Volume 10 is far away from the ""cafe del mar"" feeling that was typed in my soul through the first eight albums.it's a good product,can't deny it,but I just simply wouldn't call it cafe del mar...something else maybe.I really misses that little extra,that bonus,which was offered on almost every volume,an ""outsider"",wich made it special.I'm talking about names like Thomas Newman with Any other name,or Stan Getz,even a cover of Gula Gula from Jan Garbarek(yes,volume 8 is my favourite)...where is Talvin Singh?it's not bad,but certainly not my Cafe del mar."
2,"The Best is ""still"" yet to come.","I was so excited to see Shannon's Greatest hits, but was not to happy with the song selection. First of all, there are no remixes here to be found. Shannon had some of the best remixes of the eighties. You would think they would had at least put the remix of ""Let the Music Play"" on this collection. Secondly, The sound quality on the song ""One Man"" is awful. There's distortion threw out the song. I guess there was problems with the remastering of this track, but all the other songs sound excellent. and finally, there were many of her tracks omitted from this collection such as ""Stop the Noise,"""" Dancin',"" ""You Put a Spark in my Life,"" ""It's Over Love"" and ""Believe in Me."" It was nice to see some of her newer material here though. Over all, I am disappointed with this collection."
3,...just alright,"I think this is Beethoven for purists. Kuerti plays very individually and humanly but not so cosmically. He doesn't play with much weight or fire behind him, but rather with finess and beauty instead.The Analekta sound is decent but could be louder and deeper.His renditions are more preferable to me than say Barenboim (DG), Ashkenazy or Goode's, but it's true that Kuerti's are very interesting and unique readings indeed. They are almost like period performances."
3,go to your local sprint store,i found you can purchase this camera new at your local sprint store for ten bucks.
1,Wow this is really bad service.,So 2 days ago I purchased a great watch from this person. I paid for two day shipping because I need it for fathers day this Sunday. As im tracking my purchases I see that this item has not even been shipped yet. Thanks for coming through. Happy freakin fathers day huh?
5,Great watch for the price.,This watch is solidly built and has a simple elegance to it that makes it comfortable to wear with any outfit. It keeps accurate time and is very comfortable on the wrist. Solid buy.
1,Very disappointing for my 4 yr. old!,"My daughter received this for her 4th birthday, and it broke the very next day. The string in the base won't come out! She was very upset about it. I feel awful, but WILL NOT buy another one!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I have been searching high and low for the Bob Geldof version of Do They Know It's Christmas...and I thought my luck had turned around. My soul reason for the purchase of this CD was to own this song. However, I have been disappointed. It is the song I was looking for, but not the version. It's more of a techno/dance version that doesn't carry quite the same meaning on a quiet Christmas morn. Can anyone tell me where to find this song?"
2,"This gets old really, really fast!","With the exception of a few good songs like ""Everytime You Go Away"", this CD is kind of a disappointment. The songs get really old after listening to them for a while. These are the type of songs you hear in an elevator or at the dentist's office and then think to yourself ""Did I actually like these songs in the 80s?"""
3,Not what I expected.,"I bought this CD (compact disk) because I heard the band the Arm do a cover of Paul Young's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". I am a little confused. I think the Arm might have rocked it up a little, as modern bands like to do, so I wasn't expecting the lush and orchestrated majestic pop of Mr. Young's original. All in all, I'll listen to this occasionally if only for that joyous song."
5,A critical book for sucessful law officers to read and know.,"As a career law officer and University instructor, I have not only used this book to increase my personal knowledge but have chosen it to teach Criminal Justice classes. The information contained in the book gives important analysis of the evergrowing concern of lawsuits against the police in our litigation prone society. Kappeler provides an easy to understand format containing the crucial areas of concern for not only newly recruited officers but for veterans as well. The paperback book is very affordable and should be considered required reading for officers around the country. If you have not guessed by now... I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in enhancing or safeguarding their career in law enforcement."
5,Great movie,"One of the funniest and weirdest movies and very well done, suggest seeing it to everyone. i saw it in the theater when it came out during a film festival and could not laughing about it and remembering it. haven't seen it in a while so i think i will buy it."
5,A Fine Tribute,"Although not intended as an eulogy, this work serves admirably in that light. Buy it to remember the series whose cancellation--when the definitive history of daytime television is written--will be remembered as the death knell of the American soap opera."
5,Yu Yu Hakusho: Season 1,"Excellent for teens and older who like fantasy, adventure and a bit of violence. Has a good storyline as well. Graphics are great!"
1,No shirts in xxl,The only customers must be tiny people. There are no shirts in larger sixes. Too Bad Email me if you get a shipment in larger sixes.
5,Been DJing at clubs with the same pair for 8 years. Excellent.,"I've been a DJ since 2000, and these were my first pair of serious headphones. I've blasted countless hours of music through these and they've held up beautifully. The wiring is in tact, nothing has broken, they're still in great condition. When we throw parties, my friends ask to borrow my headphones for their sets. For 8 years I have had no complaints. The only reason I looked these up again is because I'm going to buy a pair for my friend for Christmas. All around excellent product."
3,Runs pretty small,"In my closet I have a Land's End, an L L Bean and a work-issued Wearguard fleece vest, all XL, and fit is standard to a little loose. This one is borderline tight. Color is good, if anything a little more vivid than the illustration shown. I also like that the elastic drawstring at the hem can be cinched on the left or right, rather than just the left.Shipping was the usual somewhat more than expected. Annoying but not a deal killer.They really need to check their sizing standards."
1,Good deal but uncomfortable,"At first I was pleased with this item, but after an hour of wear it was filled with static. I used anti static in the dryer and a couple other products but nothing seemed to work. So now my good deal is just sitting in my closet, probably on it's way to Good Will after just one use."
5,Amazing mystery,"In the vein of Murakami, Naoko's author revealed a world that is not quite real, but is decidedly on the brink of Japanese change. Welcome a bus accident and switching of personalities and, well, the mystery develops from there. I can't wait for the next book by this author!"
3,Book may be better than the translation allows for,"The premise of Naoko is intriguing, but the translation is awkward and unidiomatic. The clumsy translation continually distracts from the story itself."
5,Better than we expected,"The watch arrived to day,we are really happy.My husband thinks it is really nice.But we have to wait a few days for him to wear it as it is way to big.But it looks as good if not better than the picture.It is charged and ready go.It is well worth the money.We priced checked local stores and it was 60+ less.Plus no tax! A win win for us."
3,The photos are so small,"The photos in this photo diary is quite small - usually put three in half page, and the text is so big for those small photos. -> It not so comfortable to read a book in this layout.Also, most photos are not sharp."
3,Predictible,"I have read all four of the MacKade Brothers books and find them to be much the same. Boy meets girl, boy gets girl."
5,Invaluable Reference Manual,"I borrowed this book from my Sensei. Now I'm here to buy a copy of my own. I know I want this book in my library to read and refer to frequently. This book is unique in that it is both packed with information and pleasant to read.Information is organized in a logical fashion. It is easy to access specific topics. At the same time, the book is a fascinating page-turner. I started right after I tucked the kids into bed and had to force myself to put it down just before midnight. (The soporific effect I had anticipated was nil!)This book is written to a wide audience. It speaks to the beginning karateka, the instructor and to people who just want to understand what Christian Martial Arts is all about.Buy it, read it, pass it around. You won't regret it!"
3,"An overview, but not a complete guide","I used this book as a guide to recovering from patellofemoral pain syndrome, a very common, but very difficult and debilitating problem.What I found is that the book's recommendation to strengthen the vastus medialus and stretch the quadriceps group is fine as far as it goes. But for many sufferers it will not go far enough. Many doctors feel that any or all of the muscles in the leg, from the hips to the ankles, may need strengthening/and or stretching to overcome this syndrome.If you do work on your vastus medialus (which practically every doctor recommends, it's just that other muscles may be involved), follow the author's suggestion to use an electic muscle stimulator. It builds the muscle much faster than any other form of isometric exercse. Muscle stimulators are now sold on the net.If this doesn't cure your knee problems, don't despair. Find a more comprehensive (but not necessarily more stressful) exercise program."
4,Nice pan ..,Nice pan but I find the handle a little on the thin side...ie for gripping. I have an average sized male hand.Got the Friday sale price of $7.I've got pans coming out of the wazoo. People make fun of me and all my pans. Guess you could call me a Pan Handler :)
3,Dark Fairy Tale,"Tanith Lee's dark, sensual re-imagining of the Snow White tale (with dashes of the Demeter/Persephone myth) is an enjoyable read. Few authors can master this kind of ""adult fairy tale"" with Lee's skill. If you enjoyed The ""Snow White, Blood Red"" series edited by Terri Windling (which included some Lee stories), you'll like novel."
2,"Try ""Jack of Kinrowan"" instead.","I generally really like retellings of fairy tales, but this one fell flat for me. The mixing of the two stories, Snow White and the Persephone & Demeter story of Greek mythology was interesting conceptually, but didn't seem to work well overall. Actually, it seemed more the latter than the former, when it was supposed to be the other way around. I wanted to sympathise with Coria, but she was written so distanced that I just couldn't. Everyone acted crazy and cruel. Maybe that was the point, but it failed to reach me in any meaningful way.""Jack of Kinrowan"", by Charles de Lint is of the same fairy tale rewriting collective as ""White as Snow"" and was a much more enjoyable read."
4,Very As a Matter of Fact kind of Book,I flipped through this book and noticed that it wasn't written with as much excitement as Julie Perry's Book The Insiders Guide to Becoming a Yacht Stewardess. Still a good read however can disinterest you if you think life on a yacht is going to be easy. I think if Jennifer Errico has been a stew for more than 8 years she's in the business because she loves it! You take the good with the bad.Several good information addresses and phone numbers very up to date and a future stews travel companion.
2,Evil Temptation,"I love the sound these headphones produce. Pioneer did an amazing job on that aspect. They're quite comfortable too. I would pick these headphones as my #1 choice headphone however.....the major, major problem with these phones are that they break. The stress point areas of the headphones are made of cheap flimsy plastic and in my opinion that is not an issues that Pioneer mistakenly overlooked. A vast majority of the expensive DJ headphones that are on the market are so cheaply made that it should be illegal. I'm actually amazed that people continue to waste their money on these extremely over-priced headphones. I mean really, for paying $150 for my headphones - they better last longer than a few months."
3,GREAT SOUND BUT THEY DO BREAK!,"I've been a DJ for over 15 Years, have had most of all DJ headphones... These are really nice, the sound is really clear, but after a 6 months of DJing with them they broke. This is a issue everybody have been talking about, didnt put to much attention to that but now that they broke i wanted to share my review... BTW pioneer doesnt give ur money back."
3,Yes - They Really Do Break,"The reviewer before summed up these headphones and their shortcomings wonderfully so I simply want to add my voice to his comments. They DO BREAK; I guess I'm lucky in that mine lasted for just over a year. They sound FANTASTIC, the best I've used, but I've just written Pioneer to try and have them replaced. For $120 pair of phones I should be listening to these 10 years from now, not looking for gobs of tape and super glue just to listen to them only 1 year later. I havea feeling that if you reinforced that area with some tape they'd not break, or at least not for quite a while... kind of silly, but yeah, they sound GREAT."
5,Ball joint fix,"A great deal of people state that these break but a simple solution is to just spray some kind of grease in them, when the plastic ball joint is dry it creates friction and ruins the plastic and causes it to crack making the damage bad enough to break these headphones.I hope this helps anyone who is concerned about the ball joint reviews on here."
5,"incredibly loud, bassy, and rich sounding.","I had these for 1 year until they got stolen, but up to that point these headphones were sensational.the Bass is strong and it can make your head shake if your not careful.Sound is crips, deep bass, clear trebbles.. doesnt cancel noise very well, but if you have a good mixer and cue monitor you can set it to hear exactly what you need to and these headphones will deliver the sound well.there's no reason to give these any less then 5 stars I miss having these. I use the HDJ-800's now but the 1000's are excellent."
4,"If you like bass, get these headphones","I was looking for good solid headphones that could carry bass.Though it covers the normal spectrum of good sound, the bass stands out for me.I like that the headphones can fold and are portable.My first pair broke in less than a year, but I have owned the second pair since about 2005, if my memory serves me correctly.I listen to lots of genres, from classical to rap. I'm really happy with them.The only thing is that your ears can get tired after prolonged use, the headphones are large."
3,so-so,"The good things about these headphones are: the sound is decent; they fold up nicely; they feel comfortable when you first put them on.The bad things: the construction seems cheap (it looks like metal in the picture, but it's plastic); and worst of all, they are not very comfortable after you've worn them for more than 15 minutes or so.I think they work fine for DJ'ing, if you are only using one ear to audition, or if you are only going to wear them for a minute or two at a time. For longer periods of time, I would say move on to something else."
2,Treat them like eggs....,"I have been a DJ for 10 years and have had many headsets. These cans deliver pretty good sound but of the two sets I have had both have broken within a month. Both broke just above the ""U"" connector that attaches them to the speaker set. If you are wanting a good sounding set of cans to listen to on your couch at home than they are ideal, but if you are a real DJ on the move, and movin crowds then move onto another product."
4,Head Phones,I work as a part time DJ and find the phones great. Sound excellent and durable. Most others usually break from constantly taking them off and putting them on.
3,"They're okay, but I've tested many and like the Sony MDR-V700DJ!!","I particularly like the Sony MDR-V700DJ headphones. With the 50-mm drivers, they really are punchy and reveal every nuance in the music. With a frequency response of 5-30,000 Hz, they have to!"
4,A guideline to life,I thought the book was very inspirational. It gives great ideas as well as insights into Zentrepeneurship. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,It's a Game World,"Don't be fooled by the generic title, GURPS Fantasy is a world book. There is very little (only two small chapters) in the way of general rules about fantasy in the book. The rest is history, geography, and politics of the world of Yrth, written specifically for a Game Master. It works best if you let the players roam where they will, and use the book's info to be prepared for what they encouter. I really like the world itself, it's richly laid out and realistic; close enough to Middle Earth to be familiar to players, but different enough to keep them on their toes. However, such a detailed world is of little use in a hack-and-slash campain. For generic fantasy, use GURPS Magic, GURPS Fantasy Folk, and/or your own imagination."
1,Why are both the good reviews posted by the manufacturer?,"It would be nice if the manufacturer reserved the reviews of their product for actual consumers. They should stick to using the ""manufacturer's description"" section, and stop giving their own product 5-star reviews."
5,One of Japan's best kept-secret animes,"Death Note. Code Geass. Bleach. You've heard of all these titles if you know anime. But what many don't know, is Eden of the East. Spanning only 11 episodes (roughly 2 hours), it follows a plot like Death Note.""With a cell phone, and a concierge on the other end granting him 10 Billion Yen, its up to Akira Takizawa to 'save the world'. Waking up in front of the White House, naked, with a gun, his phone, and amnesiac, Akira sets out on his quest. Trying to find the motives of the users of 11 other similar people, this anime gradually unfolds into a thrilling series.""This is the sequel movie (which would be the same length as the series), and all I can expect, are high standards again."
5,Good but Waiting for the Next movie Stinks!!!,"This is part one of basically a two part movie. Not a lot of the 'mythology' is answered in part one, it's more about being in New York City. I'd say the animation is slightly better than the series animation. The first half of the movie is slower because it's all about getting the principles back together and getting them up to speed, so the second half is when we start to progress the story and get back to the game. When the film ends and they head back to Japan in part two.It's part two when basically everything is answered, Takizawa's mother and how they separated, the voices behind Juiz, why Takizawa was picked for the game, the game ends,Mr. Outside, The supporter, Saki, etc. Also in part two at the END of the credits, there is one new scene that addresses an issue from the series.Also the Anime is breathtaking the Picture is as good as it gets on blu ray a must own for any fan of anime."
2,Buy it for your grandmother.,"This album has a really good song on it, The Truth Won't Fade Away. Beyond that, the entire collection sounds like they went to Michael McDonald and said, ""Hey, Mikey, write us some boring, inoffensive 80's stuff that you're so famous for!"" I bought it used for a dollar or two from an Amazon partner, so I'm not that disappointed. I got what I paid for."
4,A very serious book about a very serious matter,"This book is not for the lighthearted. It is an excellent account of the life of Werner Heisenberg and of the strong nationalism that blinsided him to the situation in Nazi Germany. His brilliance as a first rate physicist notwithstanding, the book shows by example what happens to science when it becomes totally subservient to a totalitarian regime and shows the problems of regional politics overtaken by a ruthless dictator in the funding of science. The fine line that Heisenberg walked did not diminished his scientific accomplishment but did not excuse him from his participation in a scientific enterprise that could very well have changed the course of history had it been successful, a Nazi A-bomb. The book is also a lesson on the results of elitism in science and it shows how the Nazis cheated themselves from an even greater role in nuclear physics because of their policies."
1,"All dark, no comedy.","The critic's reviews are misleading. These stories reflect a very negative view of motherhood where children and husbands rob the mother of her identity. This view might have been engaging if there was a humorous light shed on the characters or their circumstances, instead it was just women complaining about choices they've made. A waste of time and money."
5,Dante's Cove The Complete Second Season,Excellent! Although the acting may not be stellar the eye candy more than makes up for it! Sure hope there is a season three!!
5,wow passions meets queer as folk,the second seson dose not leave you wanting more steam it has more and boy they let it all out
5,Dante's Cove - The Complete Second Season,I totally loved every minute of it. Sexy guys and gals with a great storyline. It's gay and uncensored. We need more of this stuff. Bring it on!
4,Not much about Raul,"This book is mostly about Fidel. There are only two chapters that hone in on Raul. Even Latell, who surely knows more than he could reveal in his own book, didn't reveal too much. He avoided the Bay of Pigs. He didn't say much about Cuba's interference in other Central and South American countries.Still, it's a good read for laymen wanting to know the basics about Castro and Cuba. Who will take over the island once Fidel dies? Even Latell could only speculate, mentioning a few top ministers from the brothers' group (Raulistas).Although I didn't gain much insight about Raul, I did learn interesting tidbits about Fidel: the entire clan were illigitimate. Fidel himself has his girlfriend (and their children) set aside. That both Fidel and Raul have a deep hidden side should be no surprise. After Fidel gave the reigns over to Raul in August 2006 there were rumors that Raul would be a ruthless dictator worse than his brother. That hasn't occurred."
2,Whole lot of speculation,"This book is based on pretty scrawny evidence throughout, mostly interviews with apparently quite jaded exiles. Also, the title is very misleading. The title should be more along the lines of a biography of two power hungry brothers, Raul and Fidel.Apart from that it is a good read for a Cuba novice and has good flow."
2,José Martí and Lola Rodriguez de Tió,"As a college professor, if not as a high ranking CIA, one expects an author to investigate what he writes and not be sloppy in his research. In the first page of his first chapter, the author attributes to José Martí a well known poem by Puerto Rican poet Lola Rodríguez de Tió. In English the first verses would be: Cuba and Puerto Rico are the two wings of a bird that receives flowers and bullets in the same heart.The problem with that first impression is that one can not help but ask, how credible this book really is."
5,old timers,"My Father was wanting ""The Jerk"" it for a while now, and my Mother and i were looking it up and came across this 4 pack but she said that all 4 of them are awesome movies, I must say that I would have to agree!"
5,I am delighted that the original version is now on CD.,"Over the years I have shared the Kaddish Symphony with many friends and students. They are always impressed with and deeply moved by this work. Integral to the performance of this music is the spellbinding speaking/acting of Felicia Montealegre and the sensitive singing of Jennie Tourel. The recording of the revised version of this work with the male speaker was a total disappointment to me. I did not know until this moment that my old LP (which is now cracked!) is no longer necessary. I'm ordering this one at once. Paired with the ""Psalms"" this is a wonderful reissue."
2,Genre error,"I thought that this recording would contain symphony only. However, it was too wordy. One has to listen very closely to the dialogue to see what it is about. Takes too much time! Judged my mistake when told that those who bought this CD also ordered etc. Which I ordered and it too was a talk/music type recording. Therefore, wrong genre."
2,Owner-builder?,"Although I find this book very thorough in its coverage, it was not useful for me. I am trying to build my own home and was looking to 1)understand the building process and all that is involved, and 2) by understanding more about the intricacies of building, be able to cut costs and save money. It is assumed by the author that the reader is entrusting all of the work from start to finish to a contractor. This is great if you have the resources to build a top-of-the-line custom home. I don`t."
5,Nostalgic reminder of my youth,"As a child, I loved the Ramar TV shows. My friends & I would play Ramar of the Jungle instead of cowboys and indians. These high quality videos brought back those memories. As a child I was not aware that the animal scenes were inserted, but they are quite good. I assumed they were shot on location in Africa. I have now learned otherwise, but the shows are still great."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"This film must be a joke. I can't believe that this movie is actually for sale. It's the worst crap I have ever seen - The acting was undescribable bad and it looks like a homevideo from A-Z (not in ""the blair witch project"" and ""paranormal activity"" way). It could've been made by a kindergarden. I like the idea of making a horror-movie without any blood and violence, but the plot is so bad and non-creepy, that I have nothing positive to say about it. Don't waste your time or money on this crappy ""horror-movie""."
4,The Oxford History of Greece & the Hellenistic World,Very detailed and interesting information.It helped a lot prepraring for our trip to Rhodes and AThens
5,Well done,"I grew up with Charles Dutoit but came to appreciate Leonard Bernstein from listening to the local radio station on my morning commute. Bolero, by Maurice Ravel (1875 - 1937), is one of those pieces that are almost impossible to play badly so there are very many good versions on the market. I found this to be very easy to follow.Ravel takes a single Spanish sounding line and repeats it with some variation and variation of interments. In this way he has capture the feel of Spanish music better than most originals. Timing is everything and we are carried along with the music. We start out slow and quiet, repetition using exotic instruments as the obo has us mesmerized, eventually build to frenzy and them a release.This piece was also used as the background music in the movie ""10"" for its alternative use.The balance of this CD is other Ravel/Bernstein recordings that you may come to appreciate as much if not more than Bolero."
2,Don't buy. Gets warm in less than 10 minutes,"I bought this thinking it would fit completely around my knee to help with my tendonitis. It does fit all the way around, but only stays cold for 10-12 minutes. Not worth the money."
3,Disk #1 Corrupted,"Vicar of Dibley- The Immaculate Colection - Disk #1 was corrupted and it cannot be played. The disk was washed properly, but it still does not play."
5,The best of British Comedy,"If you like British comedy, you will love The Vicar. It is absolutely hilarious and full of unforgetable comedic characters. This is a must see for all lovers of comedy."
5,Great humor!,"What a wonderful show that keeps you laughing, even if you've seen the episodes before. My husband & I love this show & highly recommend it for lots of laughs!"
5,Even I would go to this church!!!,"I really watch very little TV outside of PBS and even less ""fiction"" shows. V.O.D. is my all time favorite, or should I say favourite comedy show ever. This set is great to own because quite often there's nothing on and this always appeals. The characters are all colorful and funny as can be, well, except for maybe Frank Pickle, but he's supposed to be very drab. But he is funny at it!!! I love Emma Chamber's character, Alice Horton (nee Tinker). She's so stupid and sweet- ya gotta love her!!! The more you learn of U.K. culture, the funnier it gets. Don't be a ""bugger"", order it you sod-off nit!!!"
2,Disposable printer,"The HP 4315 is nothing special. It is a disposable printer. It is cheaply made and bound to fail within a year; at least that is my experience. After my first one failed I bought a second in order to use my stock of ink cartridges. Now the second one is experiencing frequent cartridge jams. You would think that since HP makes good money on the ink, they would build a unit that would last. I am buying cartridges one at a time from now on. I never found the ink to go very far. I don't do much printing but buy cartridges 6 to 8 times per year."
2,"Ink runs out very, very quickly. HP no help whatsoever.","I bought this fax about a year ago and do not recommend it. It runs out of ink in a heartbeat. This last black cartridge I purchased gave me about 40-50 pages before the low ink light started blinking.And of course calling HP support is no help. I described my issue with the fax and they just tried to sell me more ink. On top of everything, they claim cannot give me what an approximate page count for a cartridge. How can they not have tested their own product? This is a nightmare! I am stuck with a piece of junk!"
3,HP officejet 4315,"The printer and copier are better than others but the scan has two little problems, it need to read a short time but the quality is great but it isn't the best and the second to read more than one sheet it need more than one file. The printer is excellent but it use the ink so fast, then it result so expensive."
1,Don't buy it!,"I hate this product so much I went out of my way to write this review. It is definitely thebiggest lemon I have bought since I have been buying computer products over the last 30 years.Unless you enjoy exercises in frustration, just buy another brand, I wish I had."
4,nice printer,This is a nice compact printer. Although some of the features are not as good as the previous all in one I had like the copying & scanning. Overall its worth the purchase.
5,No More Running to the Copy Shop,"I was running to Office Depot to make copies and send faxes, and paying their high prices, not to mention the time it took me. I finally decided to get this printer, and I'm so glad I did. It was really easy and quick to set up. It works great!! What I also like is that the printer cartridges are affordable. I got rid of another printer because the cartridges cost more than the printer itself. This printer truly does it all and does it well. It's a real workhorse. It meets the high standards of HP for reliability. The only drawback is the LED display is hard to read. I feel this printer is well worth the money."
3,Works well for a while,I have had this printer for about 2 years and then suddenly I started getting error messages like the paper was jammed when there was no jam. Lately it has been non-functional since I keep getting the message that the carriage can't move and that I should clear the obstruction. Of course there is no obstruction.The ink gauge is inaccurate but I have gotten use to it. I can get weeks or months of printing done after the low ink message comes on. The fax is temperamental at best.I guess I should be happy that it lasted 2 years. I am looking for a replacement .
2,IF YOU WANT A FAX MACHINE DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this to use for a fax machine. It to date has only worked once. I had to put one sheet in at a time, because they all go through together. That's bad enough. When I tried to fax today It wouldn't work at all!!!! The printer seems to work ok."
1,Where's the ink?,"This printer is terrible for ink. I regret buying it. Between the color and black, most times I print it is warning me one or both are low. I would say before I have gotten half the life out of the cartridge, the warnings begin. I have tried to turn them off, but I can't find a way... I will not change the cartridge until the print quality suffers.Maybe I should just use it as a scanner and fax machine."
4,HP OFFICEJET 4315 ALL IN ONE IS GREAT!,"I'VE BEEN OUT OF WORK A WHILE, SO COST WAS A BIG FACTOR IN PURCHASING THE HP 4315. I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE QUALITY BUT ORDERED IT ANYWAY. I'VE HAD THE 4315 ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND I THINK THE PICTURE AND PRINT QUALITY IS VERY GOOD. IT IS A BIT NOISY, BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT. THE PRINTING CARTRIDGES ARE VERY SMALL AND A BIT PRICEY, SO I DON'T PRINT ""WITH ABANDON"" ANYMORE. ON THE WHOLE IT WAS A VERY GOOD PURCHASE!"
5,DVD Copies without Format Issues,"I finally have the chance to give this new product a good look. If you have ever tried to decide which DVD duplicator to buy based on which DVD Format would be the winner, your headaches are over. The new DVD Copy Tower Dual solves the DVD format dilemma. With the Alera Technologies DVD Dual technology, you can use DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW and CD-ROM discs all with one product. Alera Technologies new DVD Duplicators based on Dual Standard 8-in-1 DVDR/RW Technology are the only DVD duplicators I have seen that have this power. The DVD Copy Tower Dual supports all popular DVD formats and you can duplicate DVDs at speeds up to 4x using as well as compile your own custom audio CDs using the DVD Copy Tower Dual and no computer is needed."
3,A great performance of the Bernstein fashion...,"This is a great work. Debussy's ""Saint Sebastien"" is for me his best work (many may disagree with me here but I really find this a great masterpiece). The performance is full of passion and the soloists are great in every respect. Bernstein's narration adds to the performance with his deep characteristic voice. All that said I find this interpretation somewhat less memorable than that of Tilson Thomas on Sony too. The narration there is in French and though I do not speak the language I think that it fits better the work than the enlgish translation of the Bernstein's CD. Also Tilson Thomas is very intense(very tough to believe that somebody is more passionate than Lenny, but it's the truth). Finally the digital recording outshines the ~ 40 year old CBS/Sony sound."
4,Nice slicer,"Been looking for a while for a cheese slicer to replace the hand models I've bought and broken (loose wires, adjustable thickness doesn't work, etc.). Pretty happy with it - looks attractive, slices cleanly at the desired thickness, easy to clean, wire can be cheaply and easily replaced if it stretches or breaks. Dinged it one point for the ""feet"" at the bottom, which have no gripping power; the unit will slide around easily on a smooth surface. Hope to fix this by gluing on some rubber pads at the bottom."
4,Acceptable,"My mom has this style of cheese slicer and I prefer this style over other styles that I've seen. Maybe I have a faulty cheese slicer, but I can never get the metal wire to line up with the groove at the bottom of the platform. It tells you what you can do to move the wire so that it matches up, and it doesn't seem to matter how much I manipulate that, it's still not good enough. I still like this cheese slicer, and it's a little difficult to get the final cut at the bottom of the block of cheese, but I still manage to get the cheese sliced.The one my mom has (which she purchased 10+ years ago) doesn't have this problem, so I wouldn't let my problem deter you from making the purchase. My problem is a little annoying, but the cheese slicer is still functional, which is why I haven't tried returning it or finding something else.I have not yet had to replace the wire, so I don't know how easy or difficult that is to do."
1,Product dimensions is incorrect.,"I've spent over 1hr comparing the other cheese slicer and i finally chose this one because its the biggest out of all them, Product Dimensions: 11 x 8.2 x 2.2 inches. TO MY SURPRISE, This product dimension I received today, 05/26/2011 was 8 1/2 x 5 1/2 x 3/4. TOTALLY WAY OFF FROM THE PRODUCT INFO DIMENSIONS. FREAKING UNBELIEVABLE! Who ever entered this information must be on drugs and should be fired AND SENT BACK TO FLIPPING BURGERS. I've totally lost my buying confidence with Amazon.com. This has taught me a lesson not to buy anything else in Amazon.com unless i see it first on my local stores. Better yet, I'll just buy it at my local stores to avoid this kind of disappointments. Amazon.com you SUCKS..............Prodyne 602MB Black Marble Cheese Slicer"
5,Great for Quiche,I mostly use this to make a quiche to take to work. Great storage and cooking utinsele. It goes from oven to fridg easly.
2,Citizen Watch,"Received in such beaten up packaging, had to return it. Second package was also a badly torn up box, but it was too late to try a 3rd time because it was a gift. The product has been great."
2,Works well for only a couple of pulls,"This toy has a very poorly designed rip cord. If you don't pull it fast enough, the doll just spins. If it is pulled too hard it won't do too much there either. It worked great for a few pulls as the doll went at least 10-15 feet into the air.After those few pulls however, the rip cord started to not work very well as it became more and more difficult to pull and even had difficulty retracting back into the base.We have a 5 and an 8 year old, and they both had a difficult time pulling the rip cord to begin with, but once the rip cord got hung up even I had difficulty getting it to operate as well. Sometimes the cord could only be pulled back a few inches and sometimes hardly at all.Overall, this toy had potential, but the poorly designed rip cord is a big disappointment."
3,Insulin Protector Medcool carrying case,"When this product arrive, I found out it took too much room in my purse was expecting a smaller size.Im going to give it a try ,but not impressed.It was very buckly."
4,Another Fine Effort,"I have been a fan of the Rippingtons for a while. This CD is not their best, but at least it has a real drummer and not a boring drum machine. Several of the tunes are quite peppy. This one is more of a fun listen than a serious listen. It is better than most of the comtemporary jazz out there."
1,Jim Piotrowski,This CD is a RIP! this is a bland nothing new cd from the rippingtons . this appears to be a group of musicians looking to find themselves. I realize that this a whole new group of musicians but they are not up to the standard that has been established by the previous group. This should be their Rest In Peace album .
1,A DISAPPIONTMENT,"Some slaves may find this of interest but many will not. Baldwin has written some great stuff, so I bought this. But it seems its main author is an anonymous slave who wrote with his help. It appears that the market for books on BDSM is such that anything with a catchy title and an inro by someone well known will get publshed and sell even if it contains little that is new or of interest."
2,Tie Those Shoe Laces,"Anyone who can tie their shoe laces can imagine and manifest this material. It does not take someone to claim to have written something that someone else wrote (a ghost writer without credit given) to be able to think for themselves. Men do not need roadmaps, principles are for Missionairies, skills and tools may not be learned or honed in a book but by one on one close, personal, intimate, Mentorship."
4,better than average,For a TV movie this was pretty decent. Definitely unusual and quirky. Worth a watch. I saw it on TV but I've seen it sold for three bucks (new) when i first did a search and I would say worth it.
2,Picture on package misleading!,"I buy Large Cadet Bully sticks at the Pet store all the time - they are of uniform size, thick and 12 inches long. When I saw them advertised on Amazon for about half the cost, I immediately ordered them. I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED to open the box and discover that the two packages of Bully sticks contained a few (like 4 or 5) thick 12 inch sticks and the rest were either 6 inch sticks or skinny sticks that were only about 1/8 inch in diameter. I have a 100 pound Doberman who loves these but I had to send them back - he could easily choke on them or injure himself running with one in his mouth. I would describe them as ""factory seconds""!! Stick with your local pet store!"
3,Doesn't last as long.,I got this a few months for our German Shepherd and he loved it and it lasted a coupla days. Now he is five months old and this last order he finishes off each one in less than an hour.
4,"My dog enjoys them, but not very long lasting","I have a medium-sized 60 lb dog who is not an aggressive chewer. He can go through one of these in under 10 minutes, however. He seems to enjoy them quite a bit, so I keep buying them. I've bought several packages so far and I've noticed that in every package, there is a stick or two that smells absolutely AWFUL. The smell for most of the sticks is usually pretty unoffensive but occasionally you get one that stinks to the high heavens. The stinky ones don't seem to give him digestive issues so I guess they're fine, but it is a little weird....Can someone please comment and tell me why bully sticks are so expensive? Is there a reason or is it because pet companies know owners will pay through the nose for their dogs' enjoyment? Bully sticks are just cow penises after all!"
2,Very Smelly Bully - The dog likes them but I don't,"My dogs have had many different types of bully sticks over the years. Some have a funky smell. These are the worst smelling bully sticks I have ever smelled. With other bully sticks, the funny smell goes away after the bag has been open for a few minutes. These bully sticks really stink. They have a very strong smell that you can actually smell from many feet away. And it does not go away even after the stick is gone. Not only in the bag but hours later and the smell goes wherever they go. My puppy now has stinky breath. My family room where he has been chewing reeks of funky bully. But dogs being dogs really love bad smelling things. I am not returning them but I will never buy these again. We will be sending them to the kennel next time my dog has an overnight stay and letting them keep the leftovers. We have had better luck with12"" Free Range Bully Sticks Thick Select Odor Free 25 pieces Sealed with UPCEven though they are not Prime eligible."
1,"Cadet Large Bully Sticks, 1 lb.","I decided to find these locally, and am very glad I did. The bag of ""large"" bully sticks is anything but. There were mixed sizes, many considerably smaller than a pencil. The pet store wanted $39 and change for the bag. So, if you need the thicker bully sticks for a heavy duty chewer, you'd be better off looking else where."
2,Very strong stench,"Maggie loved the bully sticks, but we could not tolerate the smell in the house. The pack we got smelled like rotting garbage after sitting in the sun for hours. We froze them to help with the smell, but once she starts eating them the odor permeates the room. After eating the bully sticks, we have to give her dental treats to get rid of her awful breath."
3,It's tough to find good long last bully sticks,"I was buying sticks from my local high-end pet store. $6 a whack for a 12"" stick. EXPENSIVE! But, those sticks last FOREVER. Like everyone else, I wanted to buy in bulk for cheaper. This seemed like the best reviewed product on Amazon. The sticks are OK, but are really like 1-time use sticks. My small dog can kill one in an hour. It's probably an equal trade off since the price is so much better, but it's a little frustrating to see similar looking sticks disappear so quick. Anyway, I'll probably buy the product again because it's so cheap, and it has taught me to be more sparing with the dogs and use the sticks more like treats. Probably a good thing for them. It's just a weird change going from leaving a stick on the floor for about a week of chewing activity."
1,Very Poor Quality,"We've only used this a few times and the finish is bubbling and chipping away. One of the four gribs on the bottom came off as well, so it wobbles if we try to use. We've only handwashed."
1,waste of money,"save yourself the money and buy a sturdy handle slicer. The ""wood"" block started peeling and flaking after i soaked it for too long in water.(45 min)now it is shedding and is quite gross. I guess they cover the ""wood"" in some type of waxy substance."
5,Perfect!!,"I prchased this for quick and easy cheese slicing, it is very well made and very easy to use and clean."
3,Film is as unbalanced as the killer in it...,"The first Crimson Rivers film is pretty entertaining and beautifully filmed; this sequel's plot and the murky production values hobble an otherwise entertaining film.The story revolves around a series of religiously-themed murders, and a secret cabal of monks. The plot is straight from a Captain America comic book (minus the Red Skull).If you can get a used copy or rent one, then this film is worth a look."
4,"Warped fun, but your friends might think you're a kook!","I ordered this DVD based purely on the description provided since I had never seen this show before. For fans of ""out there"" comedy, you should enjoy this. Bizarre characters abound and you'll think you're on Sesame Street...while on crack! Enjoy the fun just don't bogart the remote!"
5,"LETS PLAY FUNNY, NOT FUNNY!","Puppets having sex: FUNNYAccording to Jim: NOT FUNNYBeat Kids: FUNNYD.O.G. O.B.G.Y.N : FUNNYJoey: NOT FUNNYWonder Showzen: FUNNY!Wonder Showzen is insanely funny, I dont' get mtv2, so I had actually only seen 2 episodes before I bought this, and, just thinking about some of the skits I start laughing. This is the best random offensively hilarious show since the dearly departed Strangers With Candy."
4,pretty good,"i really liked this when i first got it last summer, but since then i haven't been listening to it as much. i only really listen to about 10 cds though, so that's good. the cd is real good in a certain kind of way, ya know simple and good, but it isn't gonna keep you listening to it a lot forever like nas ""it was written"". ""money aint a thing"" rules, and the guests are huge, i mean, nas, jay-z, mase, mariah carey, dmx, snoop all on one cd, that's cool."
3,This CD would've been better if it was another rapper.,"I love this CD, it has nice songs and nice beats. But I think Jermaine Dupri can't rap. He doesn't have the voice and he sounds like a mouse. And all he raps about is girls, diamonds, money, just like Puff Daddy. We don't need another Puff Daddy around here. I personally think Puffy's CD was better. I don't think Puffy's a good rapper either, but at least he has a normal voice."
4,Dede Korkut: Oral Traditions in Turkic Epics,"The Book Dede Korkut is a compilation of tales about the Turkic peoples of Central Asia, who later went on to conquer Asia Minor, and much of Europe. Although these stories are purportedly about an group of Muslim raiders, and defenders of the faith, it is clear that these references are grafted onto an earlier tradition. The stories themselves are juicy, and often funny, and give a good sense of life on the steppe. The translation is excellent, with good endnotes."
4,Das Book,"For being a book that is well out of print it got to me in a decent condition, average shipping time, alright stuff"
1,I shoulda consulted with Amazon!!,"I picked up this CD in a store and when I got it home, realized that instead of the original versions of his hits, we have re-hashed re-recordings from 1994! What a let down! I was expecting the old classics recorded with the Strangers! Shame on Sony Music for not labeling this collection on it's outer package for what it is. Thank you Amazon for honestly describing the contents on your website!Anyone want a slightly-used Merle Haggard CD??"
3,What he said,as the previous person said...the case is a peice of crap and not even desinged for the mda/8125 (the holes are in all the wrong places) its some universal thing and even if it did i would never use it...furthermore the headset is crap too...but this is still the cheapest way to get a car charger on amazon (getting just the car charger is a couple of bucks more) so u might as well buy it
2,"Interesting, but not overwhelmed","There are some basic themes here that you'll find in most dating guides. 'Be yourself,' 'expect more,' and 'don't be a doormat.' The most notable things she talks about are picking up on signals, and not filling in gaps with what you want to hear. Mainly, she says, listen to what he's really saying -- both in his words and actions.Frankly, the woman who wrote this is not your standard-issue female -- she's a former model (if memory serves) who is a beautiful, on-air reporter. Her initial story is about her making out with Dennis Rodman. It kind of made me feel like I was circulating in a very different crowd... perhaps that's why I didn't really bond with her?"
3,"OK as an introduction, but not very in-depth","I purchased this book as a soon-to-be MBA graduate going to work for one of the leading airlines. I must say that it did not fulfill my expectations. It IS a very good brief overview of the major issues and concerns that air carriers face. As such it may be very useful to those unfamiliar with the industry at all and those with only a limited business background. For students at a graduate level, I cannot recommend this book."
4,former minor leaguer gives it a THUMBS UP!,"Probably only for the true die hards who eat, breathe, and fart baseball, but hey if you are reading this review I am assuming that's you. Fascinating how the game has evolved."
1,"Important project, shoddy job","Documenting early baseball for we baseball historians is a noble idea, but Mr. Sullivan's choices and blurry accompanying text leave a lot to be desired. Not recommended for novices either, as it lacks context for them to understand the significance of the documents chosen."
1,Liz,"Functionally this product is great: works awesome, boils water easily, and whistles as it is supposed to. The major problem with it is the container is made from #7 PC (Polycarbonate) which is stated right on the bottom. It is well known that you should not heat water/liquids in a #7 plastic container for fear of leaching BPA."
1,great until it caught fire!,"I thought this was the greatest invention ever, and used it often, until one day the top ignited in the microwave (after being in the microwave only a matter of seconds). Fortunately, I was in the kitchen, and was able to put the fire out before any huge damage was done. I've replaced my microwave tea kettle with an electric one, and am very happy with it."
4,Angry at Amazon,"This is a very good product but Amazon subcontacted my order out to a distributor. The product was purchased in June but the shelf-life expiration date on this is November!!! Normally, when purchased at the reatil level this product is forward-dated with a 14 -18 month shelf life. I'm forcing myself to consume them daily rather than when needed just so they do not expire. Very disappointed with Amazon for ""arranging "" to get me product that is very close to be ""stale""."
2,sharp edges can be hazerdous,"I read many reviews and decided to purchase this item. It does heat up slowly taking up to 20 minutes at times to come to full temp. I can deal with that if you are not in any hurry. My biggest problems that I have encountered are the many sharp edges that can be dangerous, while cleaning around the unit I acutally cut my finger requiring some quick first aid and several bandages to stop the bleeding. I think the factory should buff some of these sharp edges before selling these to the public. Also the handle on the cover keeps falling off. Overall I think this product has been poorly designed, I would not recommend this product due these portentially harmfull problems."
1,Disappointed with Presto,"We purchased this item to make fried sopapillas. The recipes we found online all required the oil to be heated to 375. Also, the cookbook that came with the fryer says to cook some of the items at 375 degrees. When we began frying the sopapillas, they were not cooking correctly. We checked the oil temperature with our electronic cooking thermometer to see if it was hot enough. The temperature would never get above 340. My wife called Presto today to ask if there was something we should be doing to get the oil heated to 375 degrees. The customer service representative from Presto told her that ""The machine goes up to 375, but the oil will never get above 340"". In disbelief, my wife asked if she was understanding correctly, to which the representative again said, the oil will only get to 340. So, if you're thinking about purchasing this unit and you need the oil to be hotter than 340, Presto does not guarantee this unit will get your oil hot enough to cook anything above that."
4,Works Great,"this is a great product, and the price is right. my french fries were perfect. the only complaint i have is that it takes up a lot of counter space."
4,Happy Hubby,My husband loves it. Large capacity for cooking for several people. It retains it's heat very well. The two separate compartments make it easy to fry two different things at a time. Very easy clean up as it can be taken apart and cleaned without a lot of trouble. Would buy it again.
4,Saved the day,"I love this dual basket fryer. I received it just in time for my Christmas party; we were making chicken wings for 20 people and the fryer handled the job great! It's very easy to clean and with the dual baskets, you can fry two different types of food at the same time. It's a large item so storage is the only issue."
5,Presto ProFry,"Have only had the ProFry for about a month, but so far I love it. Really large capacity, can fry 2 different items at one time, heats up fast. All in all it's great. Only down side: doesn't have a timer, but I just set the timer on the microwave, so no big deal."
4,Cooks well but is a bit hard to clean.,Like the item very much. Better than the fryer we used to have but this one is a bit hard to clean. You have to make sure you do not get the controls wet while you are cleaning the heating coils. Other than that I have no complaints. ;-)
1,DON'T LIKE IT!!,"I ""GAVE THIS ITEM AWAY"" TO A CHURCH FOR THEIREVENTS. IT JUST COSTS TOOO MUCH TO ""FILL IT"" WITHNEW OIL!! IT TAKES A ""HUGE JUG"" OF OIL EST. $14 TO FILL!!!PLUS...IF YOU SAVE THE OLD OIL IN YOUR REFRIG., THE FOODDOES NOT TASTE AS GOOD WHEN YOU USE FRESH OIL.IT'S JUST TOOOO EXPENSIVE TO USE FOR ""HOME USE""...ALSO, THEOIL TOOK ""FOREVER""....OVER 30-40 MIN'S. TO ""HEAT UP"" NOT HOTENOUGH TO FRY FOODS. i WAS ""VERY DISAPPOINTED"" IN THIS PRODUCT!!I'M JUST SORRY THAT I WAITED TOO LONG TO USE IT AGAIN...PAST 30 DAYS ANDI COULDN'T RETURN IT FOR A REFUND!! I LOST OVER $70!!MAYBE...THE CHURCH CAN FIND A USE FOR IT."
5,So far I'm Impressed!,"The oil (I used canola) heated to the correct temperature and made excellent curly fries. (I got the curly fry maker also). It seems to cook the items quicker than the booklet says so beware. We made sweet potato fries and chicken nuggets the next night. SUPER! We did not find any of the food greasy. The unit heated up quickly and cooled down nicely. It is big and has plenty of space for food. We only filled the baskets half way full but it was plenty of space.I haven't cleaned it yet, but it looks like it shouldn't be too big a job. You just remove the heating element and then lift our the square ceramic insert that hold the oil. Kind of like a crock pot insert. The baskets work great and the handles are just fine and sturdy enough...provided you insert them into the grooves the correct way to begin with."
5,Excellent chose,"I love the presto prfry cooker I have one of my own, but this one just happen to be a gift and the receiver was elated!Thank you,"
4,Deep Fry and Job with Ease,"This fryer can handle any job you throw at it. Two big baskets, oil heats up quickly. I definitly read the reviews before buying and was concerned about the oil not getting hot enough..simple soultion i do is stir up the oil when the light goes off and wait a little bit. After a few minutes i drop the baskets in and wait..the frying pretty much stirs all the oil around so it definitly keeps the oil hot while frying. I didn't give a 5 becuase it is pretty big in size and you definitly need a big storage space for it...does it warrant not getting a 5 becuase of it probably to most a no but i wasn't expecting such a big fryer, but it is well worth it."
5,Fish lovers response,"Tried it almost emmediately after receiving it (had out-of-town guest) frying fish. Did such a great job, our guest bought one also. We all agreed it was best fish ever. Also ordered large jumbo basket and like it also. We've used it several times and have found nothing to complain about."
4,We fry everything,Can now cook family size hot wings all together. That way wings are still hot when time to eat. Before had smaller frier so would have to cook couple of wings at a time. Which meant first batch start to get cold.Only problem I see so far once I put wings in temp drops and never got back up to 375 like it should have for wings. I just then cooked a little longer to make sure they were cook. But easy to tell when they are done.
4,fryer,"It does exactly what it was advertised to do. It is easy to use, heats quickly and cooks the food evenly."
2,Disappointed in Dulli,"In a word: Boring. As a huge Whigs fan and someone who respects Greg Dulli as an artist, I am really surprised by how disappointing this CD is. Fila Brazilia does come through with some really nice beat work, but the songs are almost universally subpar. With unusually weak lyrics and song structures that never change, the album feels like exactly what it is: a second rate outtake that should have been left confined to Dulli's notebook."
3,Slightly less than the sum of its parts....,"Greg Dulli's solo project is very much at the mercy of its collaborators. It is enhanced by the presence of Shawn Smith (from the criminally underrated Pigeonhed) who adds to the bittersweet soul-funk that Dulli and the Afghan Whigs have been conjouring on their last couple of albums. It is also diminished by the soulless post-production work of the Fila Brazillia duo, who add a low-frequency thud to the mix and erode the sparkle of the songs in an attempt to give them a more danceable appeal. The end result is a greyer and more monotonous portrayal of Dulli's work - there are some great songs here and one can't help but wonder how much more special they would sound if given the full Whigs treatment."
1,On Rise!,"There is so much of this stuff in the market and this one from anoushka is no new revelatation to the plethora of recordings already flooding the record stores. it is also no surprise coming from anoushka as her first three albmums hyped and heavyly promoted reveal the commercial angle of this artist. she never could establish herself as a serious performer of raga music. one blessing of this album is that there is very little sitar. the only reason rise gets any attention is that it comes from ravi's daughter!!! reading thorough the various reviews on this site, there is a wide range of dissent on her musical abilities, everything from the criticism of purists to the googley-eyed world music fans who would endorse just about anything from ravi's bloodline!"
2,Music is lovely but you can't play it at work on your computer,"I heard this reviewed on NPR. The music mostly lives up to it's billing.However, the CD is heavily copy-protected and wouldn't play in my home entertainment PC or in my PC at the office.This makes the CD a very limited value."
5,Incredible,A superb CD by any standard. I never listened to Indian music before but this was given to me by someone. I loved it and went and bought few more Indian CDs. God were they boring???
5,Rhythmic and Tribal,"I've always loved international music. I've only recently discovered Indian music. Rise is a beautiful album with the perfect combination of relaxing, thought-provoking songs along with rhythmic, energetic songs that have an exotic, tribal mood. Great music! I look forward to lots more like it."
4,"I know nothing about Sitar/Indian music, but...","I am not of Indian descent and know basically nothing about this type of music. Don't know much about her father either, all I know is he had some involvement with The Beatles. I agree with others, having a famous father I am sure helped and continues to help her tremendously, along with other family connections. Only found her from reading about Norah Jones and was curious who was this half-sister with a different last name. I downloaded seven (7) songs from this and they sound really good to me.Won't go buying a lot of this style of music, because I fear after you hear a lot of it - it starts to sound the same, but I like what I got here. It's relaxing, soothing, kinda romantic, and track 3 has some bounce to it.Anyway, people who left comments know a lot more than me about her and this music, but for my 'don't know any better' ears, I like what I got. Plus, she is INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL - KAZAMM!!!:later."
4,Great CD from Nuno,"Great CD, has influences like Styx, David Bowie, Doors. I liked every track on it."
1,"Worst Transfer I've Ever Seen, Felt Like I Was ""Taken"" (Very Angry)","I've Been Happy with Every Product I Received from Amazon and Their 3rd Party Vendors, Until Now!!!! Looks Like It Was Copied Off A TV Screen with an Old Camcorder! Night Scenes Were Too Dark to See at All! Cover Looks Like It Was Printed off a REALLY BAD Home Color Printer. Back Says Digitally Mastered - Widescreen Presentation - English 2.0 - Interactive Menus NONE of this was true!! Didn't fit on my screen properly had to undersize (1st time hundreds of movies on this TV, I ever had to do that) Sound was awful. Menu says play and scene selection that's it with a single picture background. Name of the company says ""Trinity Home Entertainment"". I think Amazon got taken by their vendor and ultimately I was the one that got screwed!!! Very disappointed!!!!! I Saw this movie when I was a kid and enjoyed it! I know it wasn't the greatest movie! This terrible copy ruined the Nostalgia for me! I won't forget that AMAZON!"
3,Musical Theme,The Script is not the best and the plot is highly improbable but the on going musical theme sort of sticks in your head. I watch the movie to listen to the theme.
2,jiba jabba,The novel is about a cattle rancher from colerado who is in desperate search of his aons real identity. This search is harshly interrupted by a phone call requesting his presense in a small town in mexico called Resurection. Atticus is called down to mexico to pick up his sons body after a sudden suicide. Once he arrives in mexico he starts to investigate the reasons of the suicide and soion starts to suspect murder.The book was well writen. It was slow in the begining while you find out all the surcomestances of what happens gbut when atticus starts snooping around the book grows more and more interesting. The book will have your stomach tied in knots by the end and i recomend it to anyone looking for a good read.
4,Short And Sweet,This was a fast and easy read and well worth it. The character Atticus is one of the best I've come across in a long time. The descriptions of life in Mexico were interesting and the mystery was intriguing. The ending was especially satisfying.
4,Mysterious...and Enjoyable,"Ron Hansen writes a beautifully sculpted novel that depicts a father's love and the trials of a confused mind.Atticus is a lonely cattle rancher in Colorado, who finds out that his son, Scott has committed suicide. He then goes to Resurrecion, Mexico, and suspects murder. The plot is exploring the fundamentals of a tested relationship that tests the love of a father to a son. The revelation in the end gives the reader a frightening and unbelievable twist, making the novel wonderful from beginning to end.Although, there are lagging scenes in the book, creating much more detail than needed, the plot makes up for that. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a lot of interesting twist."
3,Strengthening a father-son bond.,"Atticus by Ron Hansen, is a story about a father and the strengthening of his bond between one of his sons. Atticus Cody is a rancher from Colorado. After an enjoyable Christmas with his family, he gets a visitor saying his son Scott commited suicide. Atticus takes a long journey on the path of his sons suicide always suspecting a little more then suicide. To me Atticus has a few spots of confusion, there is much dialog and it is difficult to follow. Overall I give Atticus a ""C+""."
5,One of the best CD's I won,"If I were to recommend one Willie Nelson CD to have in my car it would be this one. Not one boring song on the whole CD. Willie is a unique singer who seems to have a talent for attracting listeners from all walks of life, ethnic, racial, etc leanings. Classy guy in my book and dang fun to boot."
4,A Good Place to Start with Willie,"This album would be a good introduction to the Red Headed Stranger for anyone who wasn't familiar with his work. I would imagine this would include anyone living under a rock for the past 40+ years. The album includes many of his standards, and in particular, two of my favorites, ""Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain,"" and ""Always On My Mind."" I was a little disappointed that they chose a live cut for ""Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground."" In my opinion live tracks should be reserved for entirely live albums, but that is more of a personal taste than anything else. If you're just looking for a greatest hits album of Willie's I would recommend picking up his boxed set, but this is certainly full of some good music too."
4,chevere,fast dlvry no damages cd was good and willie nelsons music was good he is one of the best top shelf country singers on a global scale not many can achieve that he is dwn to earth and his songs are real
3,Decent single disc collection.,"This is a pretty good collection at a fair price. Of course some songs are missing, but that will be the case with almost any hits album. While this is better than the ""Super Hits"" collection, and some of the other ""budget"" sets, this is not as good as ""Willie Nelson's Greatest Hits (and some that will be)"", but I think that's out of print. There's also a few 2-disc collections around that have more tracks, but obviously cost more too. I'd say this is fine for the casual fan. Others may want to look around more. Or you could always get ""Stardust"". That's 5-star."
4,The Good the Bad,"The Good: An incredibly provocative sci-fi story filled with many memorable characters; beautiful presentation, featuring fantastic voice acting and musical score;The Bad: As rich as it is, the story leaves you wanting much more."
5,Amazing,This story will sweep you away and leave you breathless. A true masterpiece in every sense of the word.
3,PC Game Review,"Dreamfall: The Longest JourneyThe game is a great adventure puzzle game but I felt it did not have the depth or excitement of the original game ""The Longest Journey"". I believe too much time was spent on graphics and not enough on the quality of the story."
5,One of the best,"I can barely fight anything. I was very afraid this would be a nightmare for me. But I was able to do it...and I loved all the places that I went and things that I saw. This was one of the best adventure games for a non brilliant adventure game enthusiast.If you are around 50 years old, and no good at fighting, but want a good adventure game where you are not constantly figuring out nonsensical puzzles...I hope you love this as much as I did.This was the best of the year for me."
1,Be wary of the copy protection.,"I am unable to actually write a review of the game (and required to give at least one star, as that's the way Amazon reviews are set up), because I have yet to be able to get it to run. And no, the problem is not that my computer isn't up to spec.The problem is that I'm running a virtual drive on my machine that enables me to run other software more conveniently.Both the software for the virtual drive and the software I run on it are legally purchased. I am not trying to install Dreamfall on the virtual drive--I'm certainly OK with the requirement that I have the original game disk in the CD drive in order to play.The nasty bit of this copy protection scheme is that I will be required to remove other software from my computer before I can play the game. Essentially, if I want to keep my current configuration, this company has stolen my money."
1,Avoid...,"As a long time Byrdmaniac own virtually all their recorded output. I dont own this CD though. As I took a glance at it on Amazon I noticed it had no reviews so I thought I would quickly drop one in to help out the potential Byrd fan. What can I say? It has a mind bendingly strange song selection to start with. The Byrds changed line up a lot and for a compilation this size there is no need to include anything from beyond 1968 (not 4 out of 10 songs). The other 6 songs are all Byrds classics but to choose only 6 songs from their first 6 albums (let alone singles) gives a rather confusing insite into their constantly evolving sound for first time listeners. To go from the jingle jangle summery sounds of Mr Tambourine Man to the drug soaked jazzy leaning of Eight Miles High in the space of 2 songs is a bit steep.This is a budget, short, unthought-out compilation that does no justice to the Byrds. Dont buy it --- buy the first 6 albums or some other compilation."
2,"Not bad, but a little predictable.","Not bad overall, but I mean, C'mon... who couldn't see that ending coming. And who hasn't heard of Jona before, and you think he wouldn't have stolen a story so well known as the Arc."
2,Nah..,Heard about this spray at Dr. Oz's show. Didn't do much with my sore throat and the spray on the bottle is too strong making me gag. Tastewise it's not too bad.
1,Avoid this!,"If you're going to buy a greatest hits package by The Bangles, buy their 1990 release ""Greatest Hits"". This release is nothing but a cash grab for their record company and it doesn't even feature all of their hits. Avoid this!"
3,Er... um... must be a period piece... a lot of music though.,"This film is a bit catatonic. Otoh, it is probably so intentionally, but then, I'm not sure what the director wanted to say through his unusual script; maybe it was radical in 1960s, but now I couldn't see what he was after. I mean, it's not quite a documentary, although it does have a fair amount of info about Bach's life. But I'd expect more from a documentary (one thing, I haven't learned anything I didn't already know).What's good about this film is that there's a lot of music played, and a lot of it is played by the young Leonhardt (where will you see such footage nowadays?). The orchestra is Concentus Musicus (Harnoncourt's famous band); they play very well. Sound quality is about what you'd expect from 1960s. All in all, I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, it's more like... well, three stars. OK for a rental because of music."
1,Worst product ever!,I took this product for 4 or 5 days and eventually upped the dosage to 10 caplets and never ever had even a small movement. Very dissapointed and wasted 15 dollars.
1,junk science,"11 years later we can see more clearly that this book is bs.thousands of end notes do not a fact make.the only folk i see trying to scare us to gain power are the gop cons, and ""cons"" is a highly appropriate word for them.i'd give it 0 stars, but the system won't let me."
4,Ideal for home archiving,"Very small, grounded unit with low to no noise susceptibility. Has done wonderfully for archiving. Conceals nicely behind my AV rack.Gold plated plugs with all hookups uncluded. Also, very affordable."
3,Got Grandma back in the groove,Got this for my mother-in-law so she could listen to her LPs again. With it I could connect her old but functional turntable to her Bose Wave Radio. Easy to set up- all needed cables are provided- and works fine for her. Not adequate if you want to rip albums- I could not figure out how to kill the hum. I hooked up all the grounding connections I could.
4,No brainer for a Pre-Amp,"Got this so my mom could listen to her old records over her new stereo system. Super easy setup with directions. Like one other reviewer said, there is just a slight, almost imperceptible hum, but that might be coming from the old turntable, who knows. Works just fine for old records. After a little research, you'll realize this is the only real option if you're in the market for a pre-amp, so it's a no-brainer."
4,The Band is so Nice to Fans,I went to warped tour and was totally bummed when I found out I missed seeing Count the Stars! I bought their CD before I went on vacation and listened to it all the time.. I went through 4 sets of batteries.. insane.. anyway! I got to meet the guys and man are they sweet and so nice! Sometimes other band memebers are tired and stressed cause they're on tour and they don't say much.. but these guys were so nice! Yea and to the person who said they heard weird sounds on track 8.. I hear it too.. it could be some minor problem.. but the CD still rocks!
5,It Works!,"I ordered both the 1.5 and the 2.5 round covers.How can you rate a glass cover? They fit, they work, and after many times of use in a microwave and regular oven, they're just fine.I have not experience any problems (which some have reported) in either the 1.5 or 2.5 glass covers."
4,Good for the money,nice product for a low budget upgrade from 1 GB to 4 GB of ram system. Good ram and pretty fast. I would buy this for an older system again if it came up.
2,Boring...,SF by numbers.... if I'd wanted a trip through a (frankly unimaginative) jungle I'd have watched The Travel Show. Still...isn't it amusing to see another variation on the Me Tarzan You Jane scenario.
2,Didn't like the Keeper- not sure if I should buy another menstrual cup,"The material of The Keeper is unpleasant, smells funny, and frankly is just plain ugly looking. At first I had a really hard time inserting it. After a lot of practice I finally figured it out, but it was pretty uncomfortable. While it was in I could feel it and did not like it. I also found that it ended up leaking. Getting it out is also scary, because it travels up and it feels like you are never going to be able to get a grip on it.I wish I had bought the Diva cup to begin with. Now after my experience with the Keeper I'm not sure whether I should even waste my time and money seeing if the Diva works. I am disappointed in the current choices available- the Instead cup doesn't work for me and isn't reusable. The other menstrual cups are reusable but not comfortable."
1,Look before you leap ;-),"It appears that I should have read the reviews before purchasing. I too have several french white pieces that I purchsed years ago that I'm very pleased with. Seems the quality and construction has declined dramatically (over the past few years). From what I can tell about Amazon's return policy, I'd have to pay to return the item. Maybe I'll buy a dog and use it as a feeding dish ;-)P.S., (I won't be buing any more corningWare)!"
2,"Functional, but not Fabulous","This is not the Corningware I remember. The rough bottom scratched my counters, the finish inside the dish is easily scratched by non-metal utensils, and it can be difficult to clean. I won't be buying more pieces from this line."
4,An Almost Perfect Popcorn Popper,"I wanted a Farberware pot and I wanted a 4 qt. pot so I decided to take a chance and order it. I solved the problem with the opening on the lid with a foil ""patch"". I just put the popcorn in---no shaking which I like for my ceramic stovetop, no scorched pot, and no unpopped kernels!!!"
3,Did not fit the bill for what I wanted,"I was looking for a dual purpose 4 quart pot but this didn't meet the requirements. I wanted to be able to make popcorn but because of the opening in the lid, that would be impossible. I also wanted to be able to steam veggies but again, the lid opening wasn't perfect for that need either. I ended up sending it back because it wasn't meeting my needs. Otherwise the product seemed fine."
4,lid has hole in it,"The pot is sturdy and heavy-with a decent fry basket. Exactly what I wanted...except the lid has a cut out for the fry basket handle. This renders it USELESS for making soups, etc. Plus, the lid literally has been cut-so there are jagged edges and sharp ends. Beware! I need a 4 quart pot so I am keeping this, but I am searching for a lid."
2,4 quart saucepan with fryer basket,I was dissapointed to see that the lid has a big hole in it so that you can't make rice in the pan for example. And they won't sell you a separate solid lid.
3,What's with the lid?,"This is a gripe, not a review.Thank you, reviewers, for pointing out the lid has a big hole in it. I was all set to check out, as a 4-quart one-handle pot is precisely what I was (and still am) looking for.I'm still using my parent's farberware, but just scortched the bottom off my 3qt pot. It was always just a bit too small anyway, so decided to trade up - and am given a choice between a two-handle model or the one I'm actually looking for....with a big hole in the lid.Considering how often this issue has been raised by the other reviewers here, you'd think Farberware would recognise that it is, while meeting the needs of the literally dozens of people who still deep-fry, failing to address the desires of many others'."
1,This Is Not 11 Inches Diameter,"If my mathematical skills are wrong, someone please correct me so that I can change this rating. The description of this item on Amazon gives the size as 11 by 11 by 6. Another site gives it a diameter of 11 inches and height of 6 inches. Thus, I was expecting the width across the center to be 11 inches. To my disappointment it is only 8 inches (6 inches deep), not even wide enough for the hot dogs I buy to fit without bending slightly."
4,... on!,"I knew jason back in the day, when he spoke of peeping toms named stanly, and sara was just a dream that danced with those lovely sugerplums. mmm. Sunnysmack is a great band to pop into a cd player and kick up your heels to. pavement is so well done it makes my heart flutter, eventho i've been listening to it for 2 years now. The band has really matured and settled into their sound, as well as learning to play with their songs a bit more during recording, which gives this funky garage band a newer more sculptured edge to their music. it's good garage music. they remind me alot of a band called ..., which broke to... . take a listen, it's worth every penny."
5,Bold and sensitive,"Jerry and Mary do a great job of tackling topics that many of us duck. I truly appreciate their emphasis upon the relationship as the cornerstone of intimacy and sexuality. They also provide practical advice about the sensory, hygiene, and ""impression management"" challenges that face many adolescents and adults with autism and Asperger Syndrome. Frankly, much of this is advice for anyone getting ready to face the world of dating and relationships!As a parent and psychologist, I also appreciate the editor's notes that caution parents about the candor of the book and give permission to copy sections for their younger adolescent sons and daughters. It reminds us that even open-minded discussion must be done with sensitivity and responsibility.Good job, Jerry and Mary!"
5,Engrossing,For the first time I've found a book that clearly explains what analytic philosophers do and how they do it! Engrossing!
1,Not worth buying,Video quality is decent. The narration focused only on geology and not engaging. Wildlife barely shown and with music only.
4,Outrageously Funny!,"American Smartass is hilarious! Yeah the quality isn't the top of the line, but it didn't hurt the film much. The comedians on this are cracking jokes the entire time and had me laughing from beginning to end. If you like stand up comedy and raunchy American humor, this film has both of those elements. It's worth a checkout. The only thing I must dock down 1 star for is the price, it could be lower or have the film streaming."
4,Noche Bohemia,"Very romantic CD with songs that make you travel back to good memories. Feliciano has a beatiful voice, perfect for these kind of songs."
1,martial art spirit,I found the book to be alittle dry in the reading.I found that the letter style of writing very boring.As far as the subject matter I was alittle confused on how the material was being presented and it didn't hold my interest at all.
5,Why didn't I hear of this before?,"Remember the first time you used a tampon? This is a lot like that but only more complicated. There are instructions but go online and look up videos and you'll find more options on folding. The best way to figure out how to use this is by actually using it. It took a couple times to figure out that the cup didn't suction right away and I cut the stem because of the reviews recommending it and then I didn't know how to pull it out! I say you should only cut half the stem and then try it, you can always cut more but you can't uncut what is already cut. It only took a day to get confident and now I wear it back packing! Make sure you have a water bottle with you in public restrooms so you can rinse it. Also the first time I used this I needed a panty liner along with the first time of the month kind of like a tampon so watch out for that. Perfect tool I'll use for the rest of my life :)"
5,"Love it, never going back to pads or tampons!","I absolutely love this cup! It is so much more convenient than traditional methods. I have been using it for 2 cycles now and have yet to have any leaking. Once you put in place you can feel it suction and it stays there until removed. And it holds a lot! Even on heavy days, I just wash it in my morning shower, once during the day, then before bed. It is wonderful. Can do all daily activities with it in, just as a tampon, but no worries of leakage down the string. The only negative is that the bottom part is hollow and the very base is a hole, so sometimes if it is not in all the way the small ring can suction on your skin down there and you might feel a slight pinch until you move to where it becomes un-suctioned, then just make sure to place the cup further in next time."
2,"This brand name is confusing, as it is similar to another product","I purchased this for my wife, whom needed a menstrual cup because tampons were causing her TSS. Now, we looked at reviews and comparisons of the brands and she decided that the Mooncup (from a brand originating in the UK) would be best for her. Unknowingly I purchased this one, which has an almost identical name. It is similar in structure to the Mooncup UK, however my wife was intent on having the other brand's cup since it has a softer and shorter form. She could not use this one in fact, and we had to buy the other brand. This would not have occurred if this brand did not have a misleading title for their product. Hence, I give two stars for our experience with the product and its apparent deception, but also because we can no longer send this, now attempted to be used, product back for obvious sanitary reasons, though it was not the product we intended to purchase in the first place.+"
5,Great product- changed my life!,"This product is definitely not right for everyone, but it works for me. At $20, it is a great price considering it can replace tampons/ pads for up to a lifetime. I have no problems with it. It is comfortable and was very easy to get used to. At first I was worried about leakage and whatnot, but I have never had a problem with spotting while wearing it, which was a problem I hated with tampons! You can do literally anything with it in. I highly recommend that any woman try it. It is comfortable, sanitary, and saves you money and waste. I have not tried other brands because the moon cup worked well for me, but as I understand, quality and comfort may vary across brands."
3,Nice but cheap looking,This pan cooks nice as it has a thick core bottom but the sides are thin and so is the lid. It has a polished mirror look to the pan and I think it makes it look cheap. Also does not wash out as nicely as my other alum. pans the mirror finish in the bottom of the pan holds onto some staining. If it was a little heavier in sides and top and cleaned out nice and shiny I would give it a five star. I have used this pan on the stove top to cook pork chop and rice dinner. I like that it has a large bottom surface. Large enough to brown four pork chops at one time.
5,Yo No Fui Cd,"All of the songs in this cd are very enjoyable. It contains a good variety. For example it has romantic songs like ""Delicuente Juvenil,"" ""Sin tu Amor,"" ""Como te Extrano,"" ""Una Rosa Para Ti."" It also has fun songs such as ""Yo No Fui"" and ""Besame Morenita."""
3,Got a bit tiresome,"I like Favre, he seems to be a down to earth guy but this book was just a bit too much of self-love for my liking. I would have preferred to have seen nothing written by Favre in the book but have others do the writing.The photos are excellent in this book and perhaps my favourite part was the chapter where the reporter wrote about how Favre is his favorite subject.It is funny how the thought processes change. Favre wrote how he would never play for another team bar the Packers......."
2,Won't Install With Roxio Media Creator,"When I tried to install this software it got part way through the process and then briefly displayed an error box and automatically started an uninstall without waiting long enough for me to read the error. Upon completion of the uninstall I no longer had access to any of my CD or DVD drives. It appeares that it corrupted the drivers. I had to restore my hard drive to get back into full operation. Pinnacle's response was that I should uninstall all picture editing software, in particular, Roxio Media Creator. I have since upgraded to Adobe Photoshop Elements 4 and added Adobe Premiere Elements 2, neither of which have a conflict with the Roxio software."
4,Complete GK Sextet Recordings,"This is the complete three-album collection Gene recorded with his Sextet in 1953, and its all on one CD! The original album titles were: ""Sextet #1"", ""Sextet #2"" and ""The Driving Mr. Krupa."" The recordings were originally released on Norman Granz' Clef Recrds label.Most Krupa CD anthologies focus on his big band recordings from the 30's and 40's. This is a great opportunity to get all of GK's Sextet recordings on one disc!It's also a great period for Mr. Krupa as his playing changed from that of a big band drummer to small group drummer. His supporting cast could not be any better with such stars as: Ben Webster, Charlie Shavers, Teddy Wilson, Willie Smith, Bill Harris, Eddie 'Lockjaw' Harris, Herb Ellis and Ray Brown. This was also around the time Krupa's career was given a second life as a featured performer with Norman Granz' Jazz at the Philharmonic series, which toured the world for many years."
4,A fantastic book in the field of Human Rights,"A. A. Cancado Trindade, the author of this book is a Judge, Teacher and Research Scholor, of International Human Rights Law. If you are not lucky to hear him personally, his works in the form of this book and writings in Journals etc, should be consulted. This book was written many years back, probably when the author was persuing his doctoral degree at the University. Cancado Trindade is a Professor and Judge both. His experiences as Judge and now as President of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights are worth their weight in GOLD."
4,rat traps,"This was supposed to come with a ""key"" to open the unit, but was not included...no where on the box to call anyone either."
3,"Cheaply made, but expected, missing key/pins","Having read the prior reviews, I guess I was expecting a cheap but sturdily made black box that held rodent bait (sold separately). In that regard I was not disappointed nor surprised. I did find these boxes, even w/ bait, to be very light, and probably can get pushed around very easily by larger animals. As another reviewer experienced, one bait station was missing the key and the accompanying pins that hold the rodent bait. Luckily I had bought 2 boxes, and the other one had a key, so at least I was able to open the boxes (and sent Amazon feedback to try to get the missing items sent). I also found the key hard to use, and had to use a screwdriver to help pry open both boxes. Not sure why the related very similar Motomco ""rat"" bait station is so far is rated 5/5, but maybe it's made better and people should consider that product instead."
2,"Nearly impossible to open, and hard on the fingers","I needed a rodent bait station, and bought this one because it was inexpensive. It does the job, but is exceptionally hard to open. It comes with a strange, two pronged key to ""unlock"" the station, so it can't be opened by mistake. The key is about two inches long, and must be pressed hard into the lock (you don't turn the key, you push it in). The two prongs are supposed to move the plastic clips out of the way so that the top opens. My key never worked. It also requires a great deal of finger strength. I finally just took a screwdriver and pried the station open, which wasn't bad when the bait station was new, but was disgusting when I opened it to refill it (when it was full of rat poop and bits of poison). I cussed the whole time.... There are better quality, and easier to use stations out there, like the ones from Protecta that open with a small allen wrench (included). The tomcat station is just too hard to use."
1,1 for sound 5stars for content,"This was put out in '98 so if you are looking for a best of, there are much more recent compilations that sound hugely better, such as Essentials."
3,Acceptable scoop,"Nothing fancy, the plastic colored insert on the handle probably wont do well in the dishwasher but the rest of the scoop is decent. As long as you hand wash it it should last a long time."
5,Favourite CD,"This is my favourite CD as of now - the songs are so simple and perfect... Emotional and well-thought out lyrics, beautiful, crystal-clear voice... Don't miss out!!!"
1,One repetitious song got this going ..................,"She has a good voice, but a very mannered vocal style, and pretentious diction that is sometimes not easy to decode without a lyric sheet in front of you. She pronounces ""one"" as ""h-one"", and ""time"" as ""tum"" to give a couple of egregious examples.The cd sounds like it was recorded in a dungeon - very bass-heavy and echoey. Production is by Bic, so she strikes out as artist and as producer. I seriously wonder how many people who bought this ever play it now. Not me."
4,Good history of cotton,"An excellent resource on california cotton. Describes seed development in detail (prior to 1980's), and gives history of major developments in cotton production, cultural practices, and law."
4,Good Guide,This book offers a good guide for someone new to homeschooling or maybe interested in the idea. If you are not certain what your child will need or where to begin this book will get you started.
5,A dream come true.,I have always wanted a Hawk and this Rifleman's Hawk is just perfect. It is well weighted and took just a few rubs with an axe stone to bring it to a high degree of sharpness. All my Aussie friends are extremely jealous. I recommend this piece of equipment for general use in the field.
3,Beware of head coming loose,"Bought this hawk for throwing, but after a few misses the head started to wobble a bit. Now I'm not so sure about using it. Has a cool look and a substantial weight in your hand...just wish it was sturdier."
1,Didn't last an hour,I an totally unsatisfied with the items. I purchased two of them and they both broke within the first hour. The heads were loose to begin with and after each throw at the target the head broke the handle more and more. Very dissapointing.
5,WOW!!!!!!,"I bought this CD from Amazon.com as I found out that it was unavailable in the UK. I had only heard the song ""Crazy For This Girl"" before the CD arrived, but I loved it so much, I decided the album would be worth having, even if it was just for that one song. However, the entire album is just excellent! I was not at all prepared to hear such brilliant and emotive songs! It has a universal appeal - it's rock, folk and pop all rolled into one! I couldn't possible pick a favourite track - they are all excellent! If you buy this album you will not be disappointed!"
4,Give it a try,"I took a chance when I bought this CD, captivated by the first single ""Crazy For This Girl"". I was rather pleasantly suprised. It fits right in with the rest of my music taste (example: Nine Days, Dexter Freebish, Barenaked Ladies, Guster...) The CD is very versatile with soothing melodies on some tracks, and a slightly hard edge...if you listen hard enough you can even hear some country influence. Definitely one to add to the collection if you like the pop sound with a bit of a rock edge. Give these guys a chance, I think you'll be pleased!"
5,Dreams Upstairs,"I really enjoy listening to this cd. I find it relaxing and it keeps me humming all day. The lyrics are clever and range from simple everyday life to crime & murder in the song 'My Fat Chance Is Gettin' Thinner'. The lyrics are set to the beautiful melodies of the harmonica and acoustic guitar. I enjoy all of the songs but my favorites would have to be 'Now It's Your Turn', 'Up In The West Virginia Hills', and 'Days Number Way Too Few'."
1,A Glass of Wine and a Book of Whine!,"I purchased this book to take on a kayaking adverture in BC - you know the kind of thing. . .active days exploring vast wilderness, whales within 30' of our kayaks, tons of wildlife and wonderful evenings at the lodge in front of a fire with a glass of wine and, one expected, a terrific book. Thinking The Pull of the Moon would be of the caliber of Berg's earlier stories. . .sad/funny/thought provoking books chronicling women's relationships, primarily with other women, I could hardly wait to delve into it. I was disappointed by the self-indulgence of Nan's focus of ""life is about MEEEEeeeee"". She had a great cheeseburger and some OK sex to show for her mid-life crisis ""journey of loss"" and her husband was gifted with amazingly selfish revelations to cherish until his wife deigned to return. Not"
4,This book is a little jewel,"You can read this book in an afternoon. This is the story of Nan, a woman turning 50, who suddenly ""runs away from home"" in order to take stock of her life, her love, what it means to grow older, and what it means to be herself- free of family obligations for the first time in many years. It is beautifully written, very poignant, and probably would not be a book anyone under 45 could appreciate. My immediate reaction was to want to take a ""road trip"" of my own because it's so easy to identify with Nan's life. That is, how much we women sometimes give up of ourselves- our own dreams- to create a warm and nurturing environment for our spouses and children. And- just how much we may lose of ourselves by playing a supporting role in helping our children and spouses to achieve their dreams. I thought this was an inspirational book and gave me a wonderful sense that 50 could be terrific."
1,This lunar travelogue is less than stellar.,"Meditating upon ""the time of losses"", the author createsyet another tale of the runaway wife in midlife seekingto keep her dobber up by hitting the road and gunning the gas pedal. Unhappily, she drives in circles with banal talk of angels, perfect cheeseburgers, mosquito bites and her fear of the dark--all set down in a turquoise journal and in sudsy letters home to ""Dear Martin"", her abandoned husband. One devoutly hopes he thinks to change the locks before her inevitable return. A walk in the woods with HDT might have increased her mileage and saved us all gas."
1,painfully ordinary,"This book read like an old-fashioned magazine article; the title could have been ""Ladies Home Journal Reader Has Mid-life Crisis"". It was low on originality and the writing style too gushy for me."
4,The Lost the Gathering Album?,"First off, if you're thinking about buying this album, you should know that this is the only Gathering album with male vocals. When I first got this CD, i was surprised to hear the male vocals, and frankly they take some getting used to. Other than that, the music is reminiscent of Always, but it's also lighter than that album. The music and the lyrics are well written. This album seems to grow on the person listening. I'd get this album if you were willing to take a risk, or if you just enjoy metal. Don't get this album with the mindset that The Gathering released this, because you might not get what you expect."
2,A dissapointment,"T-bone really shocked me on this cd being as though much of the material on here sounds a little too mainstream. T-bone is still an awesome rapper but here, He seems like he's trying to win radio airplay. The beats aren't really that great on here neither. Although there a few effective songs on here [''A few good men'', ''Shake ya body'', And ''You can't win''], The album runs out of steam before the final track comes. The only interesting things about this album are really the guest spots by Mack 10 and Chino XL. While this is not a totally wack effort, It definintely needs some work. I truly hope the next album from T-bone is much better than this one. Hope the review helped. Be blessed."
2,Depressing,Sounded like the author has a very low opinion of the legal profession. Maybe he heard and believed too many lawyer jokes!
4,shaolin dolomite,"This movie is hee haa funny. Long but, the cheesey humor is like none other. Watch out Mel Brooks youv'e compotition now. Reccomended to anyone that love to laugh."
1,Tricked,"I was expecting a new Dolemite movie, really this is a badly subbed Asian film with Rudy Ray Moore thrown in to ""watch."" LAME."
5,Nice looking protective case.,The case was a perfect fit for my Sansa M230 player. The pink case covered the blue color of my player. The case is thick and rubbery which protects the player when you drop it. The cutouts of the case match up with all the controls on the player.
2,"Not so great. Should be called ""clip"" instead of ""case"".","Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough. This ""case"" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either. About 1/2 useful, really.On the other hand....it was cheap, right? Right?"
2,not good for making cheese,"Ok, call me old fashioned, but cheese cloth ought to be good for making cheese. This is a fairly wide weave which means that you have to fold it over a few times. Also it is fairly narrow. The end result is that while it does a good job of collecting the cheese curds, they end up being caught in several layers of fabric and have to be picked out."
4,Another Good Autometer Product,Needed this for the Autometer LED gauges in my Subaru because they won'tdim when hooked into the car dimming circuit (due to the groundingsystem used i believe). Probably would need one to use Autometer gaugesin Hondas and other Asian vehicles also.Easy installation. Just be careful to connect ONLY the white illuminationwire from the dimmer to the illumination contact on the gauges or you maydamage the dimmer.
3,Amended = Censored,"Amended = Censored. Keep this in mind before you download.Decent album, but not nearly as good as the first.De La Soul, Rza, and A.G. kill it."
4,"Good acting, but with a 1 season story line.","The first year NBC mystery / science fiction series Awake, I thought was a pretty well written and produced show. Sometimes confusing because of the two similar and adjacent story sequences an episode. And as the plot line progressed thru the whole thing, I really couldn't see how they would get more than a season out of the show. I did enjoy watching it, and I think anyone that likes TV shows like ""The Mentalist"" would enjoy this too. It certainly will keep you thinking."
5,Creative Backstitch,The book is very informative about the different stitches used and also has some easy to complex patterns included. It is great for the beginner to the experienced stitcher. I am very pleased with my purchase
1,coconut muffin,"The first ingredient is coconut, I should have known better than to order this! It has very little carrot taste at all and leaves a bizarre after taste that I couldn't cover up no matter what ""faux frostin"" I crafted to go on top. Not worth the money"
4,CD single with 8 mixes of the Democracy single,"Off of one of my fave Killing Joke releases, this is a CD single with 8 mixes of the Democracy single. Some are great for listening at home/car/etc, some are great for spinning on the dance floor. If you liked the full Democracy release, you will most likely enjoy any of the single remixes out there.Track listing:1. Democracy [House of Commons Mix]2. Democracy [Conspiracy Theory Averted Mix]3. Democracy [Bi Partisan Mix]4. Democracy [United Nations Mix]5. Democracy [Right Wing Militia Mix]6. Democracy [Campaign Collection Mix]7. Democracy [The Russian Tundra Mix]8. Democracy [Hallucinogen Mix]UPC:724451426225"
5,"Me & MY MOM post a review on the FUNK MUSIC ,,, SILVA is BAD","I have to admit I slept on this CD, heard about it, it wasn't on the main stream commercial market so I passed. Thought it was another attempt from a veteran artist to lay claim to a style of music (FUNK) that has been long since forgotten, and most artist in this day and age don't even know what real funk music is anyway, well,,,,, Except for Dawn Silva who has brought back the true funk effortlessly with dance grooves that make you forget about the blues and the blahs, with syncopated vocal hooks and smooth silky exciting yet powerful vocals that make you want to get up and get your boogie on...."
1,Not to be a spoil sport but the best bonefishing DVD,is In search of a rising tide...i got it at howardfilms.comand it was incredible..that's it.
4,Highly recommend,"I've been fly fishing for 15 years or so and just started saltwater fly fishing recently. i found the DVD to be extremely informative and some of the best saltwater casting instruction I've ever seen. This is obviously older video, so the colors are alittle washed out, but the value of the instruction and ease of navigating through the material more than makes up for the older video.For anyone who wants to improve their skills in saltwater fly fishing, this is an absolute 'must buy"" item."
5,Outstanding! A Treasurehouse of TRUTH!,"This is one of the best, if not THE best, works of Christian Apologetics to be found ANYWHERE! The essays run the gamut from a critique of so-called ""higher criticism"", to what constitutes the true church, with a number of other topics as well. Read and enjoy the work that launched the movement of Christian ""fundamentalism""!"
4,"Very nice, practical calendar.","The weekly format, has nice big boxes for appointments. The moon photos are beautiful. I really like the fact that it has most every holiday I've ever heard of, including EID, the Solistices and Equinoxes, and the Jewish holidays. A great buy."
2,Boring,"The video gave massive information to the lead up and actual events of Tiannamen Square. However, it has multiple interviews from numerious sources. It make the video drag and become boring. I do not feel it will be of much use to my students to watch the entire thing. I'm sure most will be asleep before it is done. I will have to use snippets of different items to make it student friendly."
4,"Great Alone, Not so great trilogy","After reading the first two books I was very happy with my purchase. The story was great, the imagery was good, and it was deffinately controversial. The author doesn't hold back with the devistations that plague the earth wich makes it completely believable. I'd say worth reading except for the fact that I don't want to promote the third."
2,ummm....,"i dont intend you t opublish this, but as i know you read and check the reviews before posting them, i just wanted to say that i agreewith the guy this is a scam. Its too weird taht in every book theres like minimum 16 recommendations to those same books in the trilogy, for God's sake, even in the lord of the rings movie, theres lik1 16 recommendations to read this book, and other 6 to readest instead of the movie!! how can you compare a book to a movie, and how can you compare that classic with these books? I know everyone is free to put their opinion but theres definately something suspicious here about all this.... by the way i havent read the book, but i dont want anymore with this"
3,The next installment of mediocrity.,"After finishing the second book and seeing the reaction of some folks to my honest appraisal of the first book, I've decided to forgo any semblence of 'pulling punches', so to speak. Once again, I've come away with the same conclusion: great ideas, some really interesting twists and plot devices, almost no solid character development, and amateurish dialogue. If you read the first, you'll read the second and third. It's an addictive read, and you'll enjoy it, but it would've been written better by many other authors."
4,Nice,Happy to find where I could just purchase one plate. Love these Christmas Dishes. Came with no problems. Happy with product.
3,Ultimately boring,"I like Sandy Stewart's voice and phrasing -- she tells a good song story. Son Bill Charlap's accompaniment is delicate and spare. But every song has the same, slow tempo, the same vocal level and the same accompaniment. There's nothing uptempo, no crescendos, no drama."
4,"Copy Control, what a sound spoiler!","If it wasn't for the sound quality damaged by the copy control (""CC""), this would have been a truly wonderful recording of Bill Charlap accompanying his own mother, who gets really into singing love songs in front of her own beloved son.Bill's recordings on Blue Note (""BN"") label have been disappointing as compared to his much superior works with Venus Records in Japan, and this CD was going to be an exception. Well, almost. It's strange why his performances fluctuate between the two labels, even though he always record in his home town NYC.The CC technology masks the transparency and spoils the listening pleasure, especially when listened on a higher-end audio system. I wish BN not only abandons the CC but also issue their latest recordings in CD/SACD hybrid format, provided that BN would never repeat what they did for Nora Jones' Come Away With Me SACD."
4,Great Album,"Believe is a wonderful album with some of Emile's greatest songs! My favorites include ""Belive"", ""Time To Say Goodbye"", and ""Pure Imagination"". I'm certainly glad I bought this CD! His technique is purely magical and amazing to hear! You'll be glad you bought it!"
2,Disappointed in value,I purchased the mega block wagon for my 18 month Grandson. I like to purchase from Amazon and this is the first time I have been disappointed. The size of the wagon is only about 12 inched long and 8 inches high. For the price I paid I could have went to Walmart and purchased one at least twice the size with more blocks for $12.00 less. In fact I ended doing this. I gave my Grandson the larger wagon with more blocks to keep at his house and kept the small one for Grammies house. Not a good value!
5,A Brazilian experience,"I have no idea of Brazil's culture moreso with its music but after I saw Woman on Top the movie, I have just got to have the soundtrack! I have never bought an album that features songs that I know I might never be able to understand but the melody, rythm, and voices of the performers here are so exquisite that I don't care if I don't get to understand what their singing about. I love all songs for it relaxes me. How the singers here were able to give the Brazilian experience is beyond words. I truly love this and hope that others would be able to feel the same experience as I did."
5,I've been waiting so long!,Finally the seventh season is being released on DVD! I have seasons 1-6 and have watched them all and can't wait for season 7 when Mark goes through his goth phase. Time sure flies by! I can still remember when season one was released on DVD!
3,Disappointed,Bought these units from Susquehanna via Amazon. Service from Susquehanna was excellent and staff was helpful with product information. After a short while the center cap over the bulb holder fell off. There is no way to repair the sealed units. Susquehanna has stopped sellling the compacts as the problem will not be resolved by Hella. They promply replaced the units with the stanmdard 4000 series and I am quite happy. Mounting system is completelly stable and I highly recommend these units. Also bought the clear shields and they work great too.
4,Is this CD release the original movie release or the edited version?,"This is a long-time favorite movie. Being a runner helps you enjoy it, but my wife isn't one, and she loved it too.My question is which version this is.Mr. D. Dolan pointed out, seven years ago, in his review here, that the old VHS version was not the original theatrical release. It was instead a ""heavily edited broadcast TV version."" Well, I bought that one on VHS, and have enjoyed it. That's why I'm only interested in picking up the DVD if it's the original release.Can anyone help me out with this? The DVD is rated PG, which would seem to indicate that maybe it's the original. I'd love to buy it if that's true."
3,It's OK,This movie is kind of cheesy but worth watching once. What is really cool is the vintage black and white film on youtube of Billy Mill's run in the Olympics...totally amazing run!!!
5,Love this book,This book is amazing. It came in the mail and packaged with really great care and detail. I might buy the others in the collection.
2,not enough pictures,The book has good information but I expected pictures and drawings for ALL the trees and found very few pictured or illustrated.
5,Simply Amazing,"OK, so their first CD was ok, but I got tired of all the feedback that popped up all the time. Theres no feedback in this CD, and I love it. The remakes are awsome and song one is by far the best song on the CD, and song three has this awsome random banjo part in it. This band is simply amazing. Get this CD, though i dont really recomend the other one as much."
5,Wade to go!,"Thank you! Thank you! It's been worth the wait. Once again Wade Hayes proves he can sing the heck out of a song. He's unmistakeable and hasn't taken a misstep. If you haven't heard all four albums, you are missing out."
4,Good safety glasses,"I purchased these glasses because I currently have a similar pair made by 3M that I was having a severe problem with them fogging up especially when using any kind of a respirator. Tried these out on some auto body work during the sanding process and I am greatly satisfied to say that with these glasses I no longer had any fogging issues. The other pair was bad enough that I would even wear any eye protection which is a mistake so I got these to replace them. Very lightweight and comfortable, the nose set is adjustable so you can adjust the way they fit for comfort. My only complaint is as with any of this style of glasses that the protection is moderate at best. There is a considerable gap underneath the lenses that will allow small debris to enter in. If safety is your number one priority get the goggle type glasses, personally, I find those uncomfortable and quite dorky looking to say the least but hey to each his own. Would highly recommend this pair!"
3,"Very adjustable, but not stable enough for my bicycling needs","I bought these to use with a clip-on rearview bicycling mirror, for cycling in low light conditions or rain when I need clear lenses and not sunglasses. I have a larger head (hat size 8 1/4), so the adjustability was nice to get it to fit my skull correctly.They are quite adjustable, which will please most people, but that turned out to make them unuseable for my intended purpose. A couple of times while cycling, I have bumped them and inadvertently ""adjusted"" their angle... which throws off my rear-view clip-on mirror's angle and creates enough of a safety hazard to make me need to stop riding and attempt to adjust them on the road back to where I had them.They will be fine for me to use when working on home projects, etc. Not good for clipping bicycling mirrors to, due to easy adjustability."
5,BUY.. 2 pairs,"You're on this page for a reason. Buy 2 pairs. They're worth it.I almost gave 4* because they will FOG when using a dust mask. However, they're far and away the best safety glasses I've ever worn (that list isn't considerably long).Both frame arms are adjustable. Frame arms are coated with rubber (not cheap plastic which scrapes the skin). Middle nose piece is rubber too. Comfortable.I have a pair of cheapy's and when I misplace these, I'll look around for 5 minutes before settling for the other junkers.Buy these and you'll never go back. I might've talked myself into buying another pair.. yeah, I did."
5,Gladiator,"This DVD is rich in history. Not only does it cover the duration of gladiator games, but the history, weaponry, and some of the most famous. It covers the emperors behind the games, and the evolution of the arenas. I see lots of the film Galdiator taken from the history of the games. Sorry, no mention of Maximus. Sparticus was interesting though."
3,"A descriptive list, good--but not great","Nowhere in this book does the author give any justification for selecting the colleges she includes. There is no real preface, and nothing to guide a student (or a worried parent) to schools with a certain strength, schools in a defined location, schools of a particular size, or schools with any other characteristics.That's it. Just jump in and start reading. Maybe you'll find something that sounds good.This is an easy-to-read, helpful, thorough list. But some kind of serious introduction with a guide to help the reader navigate would have made the book truly useful."
4,????????????????,"i heard a song that went hard. it went,'you can mess with them, but if it aint b-gizzle you aint bangin then' is this da same dude?????"
4,"Good looking, low cost","Good looking, light weight, low cost. Nice novelty to fly once in awhile. It's just what I was looking for."
5,Inexpensive yet great!,"What is so wonderful about the flags sold by this seller is the free shipping aspect. The price is perfect and the flags are made of a lightweight and flowing fabric. I just love everything about this and will buy more in the future, I'm sure."
5,Nice!,"I have used this little guy a lot, and it is good for crushing small batches of herbs. I have a larger one for bigger tasks."
5,"Watergardening Made Easy, I love it.",I Loved it. For once a video on watergardening that kept the installation process easy. After watching this watergarden video it makes me feel like even I could install a pond. I suggest it to anyone who is interested in watergardening. Also it nice to see a younger man with great thighs installing the pond instead of the usual ninty year old. Keep up the great work on watergardening.
1,Boring!,"Since 1 star is the lowest I can give, I'll give it 1. But in reality, it would be none. This film lacks the steamy attractions that were previously described to me. These guys showed lack of appeal and charisma. Total disappointment."
4,shoegazer's paradise,"this is truly a great record, especially if you like guitar bands! the 45 single from this release (young splendor/ tree) got major rotation on my turn table. if you like this and it's new to you, you might also want to check out polvo, or swervedriver, or sebadoh, blah, blah, blah"
3,"looks good, not as comfortable as you'd expect a Clark","looks good, not as comfortable as you'd expect from a Clark. Actually, it's pretty stiff. And the size runs bigger."
5,A COOL ATTACK!,"this is an attack based on draciels spical power(lanch ur top 5 seconds after oppounent.) this works with all draciels but works best with draciel fortress. its called FALLING BOULDER attack. after ur 5 seconds is up, jump up and when ur feet hit the ground, bend down a bit and launch really hard right on top of ur opponents blade. it is almost always a 1 hit knock out. WARNING: when u launch ur draciel get to a standing posision AMEDEANTLY! 1 of the blades may fly out and hit u in the face. the draciel usally flys out of statuium, this means u lose. this attack may result in ur draciel being knocked out or getting really week. if u do not want the base of ur draciel banged up, do not use the attack.please tell me if this attack helps u.LET IT RIP!!!"
5,"this blade is lush , but","yeah, yeah this blade is really lush but I know a beter1 like1 galzlly attack ringm draciel wieght diskm draciel blade basea bird bit chipso now you know the ultimate blade, well extremely close to beingthe best anyway.I won all my battles with this blade andso would you!if you ripped properly, of course.also watch out for m dragoon, thats is one harsh bladebut after all that , i would reccomend this blade to anyonewho really is a great defence bladerbut saying that its great for beginnnnresyeah its lush but now you also know the ultimate bladeLET IT RIP!"
4,Master Draciel,This blade is awesome.It can spin longer than most blades .The only drawback is the size.but it really don't matter cause little blades are chewed up and spit out by this monster.
4,Sturdy enough for hardcore garbage truck fanatics...,"I was glad to have found a good price with reasonable shipping on this truck. I saw it on ebay and decided it would be a good one for my garbage truck-obsessed son, but the price was too high and the shipping was insane for this large but not very heavy truck. This truck is nice because it is very sturdy and interactive. I also love that it doesn't require batteries (so I don't have to change them!) but does require a healthy imagination. There is no plastic in the windows around the cab so you can put your own drivers in."
4,Good DVD of a great live band,Fantomas/Melvins doing the damage. Playing what seems to be a pretty well established set list for this superband. Although it does skew toward Fantomas rather than Melvins material. The audio quality is good. But the video quality while fine is not outstanding. Has an audio commentary with Melvins and Danny Devito!
2,Good food processor made with poor materials,"This unit does a good job processing food, but it is made of poor materials. The processor bowl is a brittle plastic. Ours broke after about 3-months. This unit is made by Salton. No replacement parts are available. We had to throw the unit away because of a broken processing bowl. Quite a waste for an over $ 100 appliance. My advice, get a Kitchenaid or some other unit that offers replacement parts when they are needed."
5,Roll 'n Multiply game,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3rd grade son. We were looking for a fun way to help him memorize the times tables. It seems to work better than many of the mnemonics (songs, etc.) being used at his school. And, the game is fun for his older siblings, also. It stores neatly and seems quite durable. I would recommend this to other parents."
4,Worked after reprograming all the openers,Worked fine but had to program this device first then reprogram all other openers so they would work. I recommend this product.
1,not recomended,"i bought it when they on sale black friday, but they sent me a defected watch. and they dont replace only refund, and the product sell by amazon"
2,GD&T Text,"Instructional manual is poorly organized, with ""Figures"" far removed from the physical location of the explanatory text associated with the ""Fig."". Had to copy pages, clip figures and have them handy to look at while trying to understand the text.Just a poorly written manual."
2,Cool looking non plastic storage,"These look great and I do prefer enamel over plastic for food storage, however the plastic lids split quite easily. I still use them to store food without using the original lids. Instead I use plastic wrap to seal them."
2,"Sounds dated, expected to enjoy it but didnt.","I really didnt care for the cd, its overproduced the vocals sound like they're being sung through a voice-box, and they're not focused nor powerful unfortunately. The speedier tracks seem to lack control and have none of the power of equally speedy punk or thrash. Its like they're trying to outrun themselves.The tracks themselves try to sound upbeat, but underneath it all I found the music somewhat despressing despite the uptempo.I've been suggested some of the Reverend Horton Heats newer more mellow stuff so I will check that out before I write the band off entirely."
3,Should have stuck with the stoey line.,"For over 90 books , Remo has been a foster child with no living relatives. Now Smith might be his father, give me a break.. Warren Murphy must be getting tried..."
3,Statistics for People Who (Think They) Hate Statistics,Arrived quickly. Would have liked to have known more about the difference between the Excel vs. regular version.
5,Great product.,I actually paid for two of these now. They are the largest Mini SD card you can have to spec and the price is amazing! I use this product in my phone so I can carry lots of music and games around. It can even hold some movies! I fully recommend purchasing this if you need some more storage.
4,SAN DISK MINI SD,For far the disk is working well with my nokia cell phone. I just need to check why my phone has been resetting itself since I installed it.
5,NE state champ speaks.,Yes i am the Ne state champ. Well my team is. But im the leader. I mix this with the jumping base's wieght disc and attack ring. When you lunch it right it can go for 4 min. It also works the other way to only it doesnt go for 4 min. Try mixing these blades. I use to only go with the stalk desighn until i found this combination. P.S. Your friends mite get mad for you breaking there blades with this combo.
4,mine has already broke one!!!!,jeez....if your lookin for a great blade from the box..get master dranzer :) my brother got metal dracil....and ive already broke it!! and he can't find a replacement attack ring! if u want something that totally humiliates most others...get this beyblade!and i got my master dranzer 2 days ago!!!remember...LET IT RIP!!
4,Good Endurance Beyblade,This beyblade has great endurance.I just bought it and I'm the best in my neighborhood.Just slap a Master Dragoon attack ring (my opinion) on it and you'll have a great beyblade!
5,Very Pleased,We were very pleased with our chairs. The box was in great shape. They were tied in really well and came in early. The chairs are very sturdy and well made.
1,save your money,"Very disappointing treatment of an interesting topic. Focus on a small number of characters, a few points in time and a small geographic region make the reader wonder how general is the author's account. Add to this that the prose is pretty uninteresting and you have the makings of one of the worst (of many) Civil War history books I've read in the last 2 years."
2,Unimpressed,I have other dvds from this series. The beginning video was a pretty solid introduction to an intimidating subject. I was really hoping that this would build on it and have a similar production value and valuable information.
1,wrong in all ways,"Cons only, no pros:the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery, totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash"
4,Great Case for LX-2,"This case works well for the camera, but the elastic straps releasing the flash is a significant design error. Placing the camera in with lens facing the back of the case works much better. The belt loop only measures 1.25 inches effectively, so it will not work with all belts. All in all, the case will protect the camera, which is why I bought it."
1,Don't be fooled!,"Yes, everyone says that Outgrabe are so transcendently spiritual, but a close reading of their lyrics shows them to be existentialists! And I have heard recently that Christopher St. John was seen at a Brights gathering. And everyone knows what that means!"
1,Watching the fall,"This is yet another step in the consistent decline of a fantastic band. They peaked with ""Welcome To Earth"" but have yet to recover from it. After the atrocious efforts ""Harmonizer"" and ""You And Me Against The World"" (no Stephan, it's just YOU), I thought there might be some promise in an album full of covers. Surely they couldn't take a collection of good or great songs and ruin them, could they?Sadly, yes. The only standouts on this record are ""Coma White"" and ""Fade To Black,"" both of which were recorded years ago when they were still a relevant and interesting band. Save the money and spend it on something more enjoyable, like a root canal. This is terrible."
3,it's heavy,"If you REALLY want to read an intensely heavy book on the subject of language origins, go for it!It does presuppose evolution rather than a Genesis Biblical point of view."
4,Brief Response,"This seemed like a nice journal, looks classy. I gave it to my stepdaughter for an engagement gift.Our Engagement Journal (Interactive Journals)"
3,What a disappointment.,This Disc is a continuous mix of some of the hottest riddems ever made. The disappointment lies within the production of the CD. The producers chopped the quality of the music by overlaying to many samples of unecessary sounds. Simply horrible.... The only thing good about this CD is the fact that it is non-stop...
4,so far so good...,"I'VE BEEN MARRIED 11 YEARS, 2 KIDS UNDER 9 YEARS OF AGE. SHE IS A ""WALKAWAY WIFE"" AND TOOK THE KIDS. SHE HAS A BLOOD THIRSTY ATTORNEY THAT LIES CONSTANTLY AND GETS CAUGHT UP WITH MY WIFE'S EXTORTIONS OF THE TRUTH. I NEED SERIOUS HELP AND THIS BOOK AND OR REVIEW MIGHT BE THE KEY. PLEASE CONTACT ME. I HAVE SPENT 35K SO FAR TRYING TO DEFEND MYSELF AND SEEKING JOINT AND IT STILL ISN'T OVER AND THE CUSTODY EVALUATOR HASN'T STARTED YET. LETTING YOUR WIFE STAY HOME WITH THE KIDS WHILE YOU WORK, IN MY CASE HAS BEEN A BIG MISTAKE, SHE LEAVES, I HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE NEXT 12 YEARS."
1,Save your money!,"There are 3 major problems with this game. First, when you start a new puzzle, all of the pieces start in the area where you are supposed to assemble the puzzle. It takes too long to move the pieces so that you have an open area. Second, once you move the pieces, there is very little room on the outside of the assembly area to let you sort the pieces. Third, almost all of the pictures are of trees and water, with a floral picture thrown in here and there. Very little variety as far as the pictures. So...save your money!"
2,"standard concept, humdrum presentation....","I just dug this out of the attic in one of my ""I have nothing to read!"" fits. Now I remember why it was there. Michaels' book has all the standard sf/fantasy mix, with absolutely nothing new to spark the reader's interest. There's the heroin who doesn't know she has the Power to save the planet, the mad Prince who isn't as mad as he seems, the political intrigue, the telepathic companion animal...blah, blah, blah... It's your standard bargin bin stuff, and if you find it there for .50 go for it, otherwise read a Lackey novel."
5,Love these shoes!,"I wish they would bring them back,this was my favorite shoe ever!Would buy two pairs at a time,they are so comfortable,i miss them!"
4,Gimme the Lute!,"This is a great CD. Highly recommended for fans of Vivaldi and Baroque music in general. This is relaxing music that's the perfect accompaniment to dinner, reading, study, or a walk in the park with a nice pair of Sennheiser headphones. A Clear crisp recording full of life and movement. The only reason I hesitate to give this five stars is that its the only Cd of concerti for lute, guitar, mandolin that I've listened to and so I've no point of comparison with other recordings."
1,"Not for Fine, Soft Hair and Heavy","I can only review this as it applies to someone with soft, fine hair. And my review on that is Do Not Buy This Dryer. First, the Ion feature must really exist as this dryer took all the little body my hair has away and left it deflated, flat and lifeless. It also removed any body usually achieved using hair gel. My old dryer left my hair crisp and bouncy when dried with gel and a round styler brush, this thing left it flat as though I had not even blow dried it. And it is heavy and has a very fat handle, hurt my wrist. It went back for a refund."
4,Great photos,"This small book has very nice pictures and good information about each stone, including where it is found, the relative hardness, availability, and value. I enjoy wearing jewelry, but am not in the jewelry business. This book was recommended by a terrific jewelry artist and it is well worth the price I paid."
2,Not quite what I expected...,I was looking for a book on stones that had larger pictures and more information. It was missing informatioon that anyone into Reiki would need. It is also smaller than a normal book. I guess I did not choose wisely.
3,"""Lotus"" intricately, carefully written","This story starts out in the middle of the action and the present and past are intertwined. It is done well, so it's not confusing. The book deals with older teen and adult issues, so it may be confusing for younger readers. But any fan of L'Engle should read it."
4,Controversial yet Nice,"Madeleine L'Engle brings us yet another thought provoking book. She reunites us with characters from her beloved time trilogy. Meg and Calvin's oldest daughter, Polly, is on an educational trip to Greece and Cyprus. Once she is there, she starts to relive her recent troubling past. One year before she arrives in Greece, Polly meets Maxa, an intelligent and wise elderly woman. Polly idolizes Maxa, because Maxa helps Polly to overcome her troubles. One day, a drunken Maxa makes the mistake of hurting Polly, and she discovers the startling truth that Maxa is only human. Will Polly learn to forgive Maxa? The novel has many controversial issues in it, and should not be in the young adult section. But the book still shows the meaning of trust, love and honesty."
5,another gem!!,"madeleine l'engle has always been a source of light to me and does not let me down in this book. she deals with delicate matters such as homosexuality, loss of virginity, and family relations so well i was astounded. the plot never got confusing despite it's many flashbacks. i would recommend this for any girl who is searching for answers but not for the weak of heart because this is an extremely emotional book. read on!!!"
1,very disappointed,"Great concept, stainless steel and glass jar. Only works on low speed and pulse from day number 1. Very disappointed ."
1,Gas Cap,After purchasing this product started smelling gasoline when parked in garage. Put old cap back on and smell went away. No other problems with cap other than gasoline smell.
4,Fabulous feeling overcomes slight annoyance,"As many others have reported with similar products, the suction cups don't work well with non-stick tub surfaces. But boy, when you turn the thing on, it simply does not matter. The bubbles are so amazingly strong (even on low), it's hard to hear the motor several feet away. And it provides just enough heat--the water does eventually cool down, but *much* more slowly than an ordinary bath would. It's a great value for the money, feeling way better than some of the tiny jets in hotel-room tubs.I recommend you get one, but make sure it's this model (which also included a remote control and vibrating bath pillow)."
5,"A Lively, Bristling, Organic Set","I almost didn't bother with this one. I loved Pete Yorn's studio albums, but played them to death. Another 2-disc set just seemed too ""Been there, done that.""I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a tight, outstanding concert, bristling with energy, & Yorn is backed by a first-rate band that give these familiar songs an unexpected freshness. Top that off with outstanding production qualities. By the end of what could so easily have been an overlong, artist's vanity project, I found myself pushing the ""Repeat"" button!He had already proven he could write, that he was a solid musician -- He played most of the instruments on the ""...MorningAfter"" album-- Now add ""solid concert performer"" to an already impressive resume.BTW-- Nice to hear Elvis' ""Suspicious Minds"" minus the schlock that stripped the rock-'n-roll out of ""The King's"" rendition!"
1,Neck Massager,The item was very bulky and too big to be worn around the neck. It felt as if I were putting a life preserver. I returned the item.
1,a Remodelling Contractor in Seattle,"I bought this tool over a year ago, and out of frustration with its performance finally eliminated it from my shop recently. It seemed like a great idea - there are so few saw options out there for small-scale, detailed cuts. I tried this saw on several projects, and found it way too underpowered (even to cut a sheet of 1/4"" masonite) for most of my application. Plus it is extremely noisy once the thin blade contacts and begins to cut the material. Finally, you have to be very careful how you use it because the blade can catch and run away on top of the material you are trying to cut - a dangerous situation. In summay, this might be good ""convenience"" tool for hobbyists cutting small craft materials, but for anything more serious, I recommend looking elsewhere, as I am now doing."
1,little stinker,"I purchased this tool to make small cuts and I thought that because it was makita it would be awesome but, it was very noisy and performed like a cheap childs toy! It would not cut through the softest of pine without effort. I finally gave up on it and found out that by using a hand saw it saved a lot of time and worked better!! I would not buy this tool even if it cost $5.00. If I hadn't lost the reciept I would have took it back. I cant believe it is still in production DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!"
2,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this Makita saw. I bought it thinking that I would be able to use it around the house for the times that I couldn't use my big 7 1/4"" circular saw. I love Makita products, so I ...thought this product was for me. So I bought it. When I received it, I couldn't believe my eyes----NO CHARGER AND NO BATTERY---it doesn't come with the saw! Where I live, you just can't find stuff like the charger or the battery to run the thing! I had so much hope for this product, ...So if you're looking for a saw without a battery or a charger for the battery, then get this--..."
2,"Utterly ruined by Rostorpovich's tempo, or lack of it","It must have been Giulini who started the modern tendency to maunder through the orchestral accompaniment to the Beethoven violin concerto, but his tempos with Perlamn on EMI are greased lightning compared to this painfullly sodden version led by Rostropovich. At 46 min., it is only 2 to 6 min. slower than other versions, but it feels like a world running on molasses. The absence of accent and propulsion makes all the difference.The first movement in particular hasn't a hint of vitality, and although Vengerov does everything possible to add interest in his tone and phrasing--both marvelous--this CD is a keen disappointment to anyone who admired his early Beethoven sonata recordings. He oculd have produced a concerto for the ages, but now we will have to wait until the remake, perhaps a decade or more from now."
1,"Miserable mixing (or recording...)! Violin sometimes barely audible, unacceptable volume swings.","A thoroughly flawed recording. Other than the cadenza (way tooooooo slow -problem mentioned in other opinions as well), the phonic quality is totally out of whack! Miserable mixing (or recording...)! The violin is sometimes barely audible - unacceptable volume swings. Definitely doesn't do justice to Vengerov and such a fine orchestra. Rostropovich is well past his glory days - should have exited graciously after his (fantastic!) cello playing weakened..."
3,volleyball pal,"This is a good idea but for older kids to practice, the tether is too short. It would work better for kids 10yrs old and under."
5,Great training aid,Very cool product. No more chasing the ball or sending it into the wall while practicing your serves. Your player will love this.
3,Life is tough but God is Faithful,This was an okay read. I enjoyed the travel cross country. Paris was out to succeed with her book. I didn't feel too much love from Dana toward Paris. I don't see how those two were best of friends. I really felt for AC even though he was abusive.Good luck Joy. Be Blessed!
2,Great Journal - UNAVAILABLE :(,Jezuz this was the best journal I've ever used! Now it's out of print. I'd buy a whole box if I could find them. PPPlease - bring them back! :)
5,Great DVD for chidlren,Really great dvd it has nice songs and my children have always loved watching it. As they get older we call out all the different animals and pictures and it helps facilitate their learning. Also bringing worship for God into their precious hearts
5,My baby girl loves these videos!,"We cannot get enough of these Praise Baby videos! I started putting this video on in her room when I change her and groom her for the music aspect. The music is so pretty and relaxing. I think she was 6 months old when I started and she would watch! She has No interest in any other videos still! I have ordered 3 of these videos and she loves each one. She actually mimics some of the movements, she smiles & waves at the babies on the video. Its so cute. Sometimes my 6 year old son will even watch with her. I don't mind getting these uplifting & beautiful songs stuck in my head all day! I'm ordering more today!"
3,"Good, but not restored.","Nice , but not miraculous. I was hoping for miracles with my faded wood furniture. I had just used Old English scratch cover on the furniture and that did well. But then I searched online for something that would really bring back my furniture without the cost and mess of refinishing, and I found the Howard's restor & finish and the youtube clip looked great. I ran down to the local Home Depot and spent about $25.00 worth of Howard products and could hardly wait to use it. Unfortunately, I could see no improvement over what the Old English had already accomplished. I wish it could have done better. There is also a strong odor and you must ventilate the entire house."
3,"Great Makeup, ok pictures","The makeup in this book is great, the book is also great, the only thing I dont like is as a photography who does beauty photography I see no change in camera angle. All pictures are shot from one position. But all and all it is an amazing book."
2,I CAN'T GET IT..,"This author, William Hess, does always the same thing (see ""ZEMKE'S WOLFPACK"", the history of 56th Fighter Group): he takes the combat reports written by the pilots and publish them, with no particular insight, no human side to the history, no strategic comments. The result is an endless and boring reading of air combats after air combats. Argh!"
5,The best!!,"I expected less, but I got the best!!! I was looking for these videos for a while, when I found them, i ordered them and they were selivered as promised. thanks"
5,Classic monster movie collection.,I enjoyed all of the movies.. arrived on time. thank you very much Amazon for carrying this movie. arrived in perfect condition. not a scratch on the any of the DVDs.
1,"Horrible Concert, Terrible band","With the first sample of this cd, I though this group showed potential. Upon purchase though, I discovered the band wasn't as good as I had anticipated. Never-the-less, I decided to give them a second chance, and was fortunate enough to see them in concert. This was not a good idea. The band was late, and very off tune. Never again shall I spend money on anything of 5ive Style origin."
1,A bomb,"Even though it was a fast delivery it was way too expensive and had sugar in it as well as citrus fruit which I can't eat. I didn't notice the ingredients before I bought it. I don't remember being this being well displayed. I didn't use any of it, I gave it away."
5,Good quality,"I like the Maxell button/coin cells the best. The tolerances with the batteries are very tight. I have a Mazda and the key fob needs one of these about every year. The Sony batteries don't ""quite fit"" in the little holder inside the fob. The Maxells fit perfectly, and last a long time. I would highly recommend these batteries."
1,Weak Weak Weak,"On the plus side, each battery worked initially in various installations. On the MINUS side, they each worked so briefly it wasn't worth the trouble installing them."
5,The most cheap I found,The price is really good. You can only get one battery in super market when you spend the same money. This battery model is very common and useful.
1,POOR DESIGN,"I bought this item to use in lieu of my steam iron when my carpal tunnel flares up. I haven't tried using it on a wrinkled garment--only to touch up after ironing. My complaint is that the water reservoir cannot be fully emptied after use so water stays in it. Two small screws inside the reservoir are rusting after one use. I used it about 2 weeks ago and it still has water in it. I called Conair customer service and they told me you have to use all the water by steaming it out. There is a small plastic cap device and that's the only means of putting water in or taking it out. It's the same type of cap used on pool flotation devices. I'm returning this because of the water reservoir problem. It needs to be redesigned. If it were actually good for removing wrinkles, I would be afraid the rust from the screws would ruin my clothes."
1,Poor product,This steamer performs very poorly. The wrinkles in my shirts just laughed when they saw it coming. Now it sits in my closet collecting wasting space.
1,Very Poor Performer,Heats quickly but puts out only small amount of steam. Need to move VERY SLOWLY IF AT ALL to get out wrinkles. Then had to wait every few seconds for it to heat up again to get more steam. TERRIBLE! Returned it immediately.
1,From mediocre to didn't work at all,"The first three times I used the steamer it was okay. Worked, but not as good as my previous stand-up steamer. Then the product stopped steaming. Conair replaced it right away (I had to pay $5.00 shipping). The replacement barely creates steam and doesn't work at all. Not enough steam to remove wrinkles. I cannot recommend it -- and I tried 2 steamers. Bummer."
4,Not for a quick trip,"This book is really good and best used if you have a fair amount of time to wander around New York. It is like trailing through the city with a friend who has lived there for a long time; Marrone has great excursive lengthy interesting descriptions of a number of buildngs, and that's great. The problem is that each chapter has its own tiny map, and they are never put together in a larger overall map anywhere, making navigation difficult. If you have a lot of time, and want to do just a few buidings per day, that's fine. If you want to storm through NYC and see as much as possible in a limited amount of time, if is difficult."
3,Good watch for the money but you can get the W5200013 for $2400,Good watch for the money but you can get the W5200013 for $2400 at the Cartier store. They look pretty much the same so you might as well save the money
2,Eh......,"Ok book, not much meat. Basically a long way of saying: You can do it if you believe you can!The book should have been a couple of chapters long, but it feels padded. Most of the stuff gets said, then re-stated in a slightly different way several times."
4,Arrived very quickly!,Met all expectations. Needed it for a weekend event and the flags were here in a short-period of time.Still wish I had some type of pole to hang them from...
2,Lids difficult to get off,"These lids can be very difficult to get off. If you have a hot item like a baked apple in it (and this cup is the perfect size for a large baked apple---thus the two stars), along with the apple's hot juices, beware and good luck! When coupled with the knowledge Pyrex is now made by another company and their items are exploding on their cutomers, well, I am tied up in knots until this item is back on its shelf (assuming they don't explode when sitting still in the dark :-| )"
2,There are Much Better Books Out There Now!,"When I wrote my original review I criticized this book for extremely sparse games coverage. IMHO, those folks who are praising this book for its games coverage either a) have not read the book or b) are affiliated with it in some way!Just ask yourself, Is coverage of two games enough? I think not!The book I'd recommend for Flash games development (in addition to Flash 4 Magic) is Flash 5 Actionscript for Fun & Games by Gary Rosenzweig.With 17 chapters, 11 of which cover an average of 3 games each, this book has something for everyone. No matter what type of Flash game you want to create this book can help you get started!And, if you want to learn Cartooning you may want to check out Flash 5 Cartooning."
1,Pure Slumdog Stuff,"The writer is re-telling Harry Potter a.k.a Lord Rama - that too very badly. I can't believe how this piece of pure trash got published. From what I glean from this pure garbage; the writer seems to have been inspired by Harry Potter ( Lord Rama), Barbara Cartland ( check out the love scene between King Dasaratha and his long-forgotten first wife for a good laugh) and Rapunzel ( Sita ) and not by any measure, the great Indian Epic Ramayana. The Book is a monumental mouse.BTW, the person the writer calls Demon King, that is Lord Ravana, is revered as a God in some parts of India till date. I sorta like this this chap ( Ravana, not the writer) myself! Ramayana is slightly more complex than a straight-forward fight between good and bad, it is layered and most importantly, a great leveler.Hi Amazon,Can I give this book a Zero?Cheers to Everyone ( except the writer, of course)"
5,Great price and well made!,I didn't know what to expect to receive when I ordered this flag due to the low price. I am very pleased with the material and the graphics!
1,Thanks goodness it came in its own box!,"Otherwise I probably would have mistaken it for packing. This product is made of flimsy white plastic that looks like it was hand cut with scissors (edges extremely uneven). DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!! Instead, fork out an additional few bucks and get a legit spice drawer organizer. This one is probably worth $0.17."
5,Best foot rest!! (Forget the plastic kind) ...,"If you are at a desk for many hours a day, then you really need a foot rest. Also - if your desk is higher than your normal position (after adjusting your chair height) then you need a foot rest.I am pretty normal height and most desks fit me without a foot rest - but - I love having this one. I use the foot rest as a change of position and it really helps when I can put one foot up, or the other down, or both on, or both off, .. you get the idea. This foot rest is solid and the all metal construction really is a big deal. The plastic type fall apart and are easily damaged. Additionally, the plastic can shift or move with very little pressure applied making them hard to use - which is exactly what you don't want from a piece of ergonomic equipment. You want it easy to use - to get maximum compliance.Simply - this is the best:Large surfaceDurableEasy to usestays in place."
5,A VERY GOOD BOOK,"This book is a sleeper. I had never seen it, or been told about it. Why! I found it at a book sale in NY. It is one of the best reads I have had in detective stories for a long time. It is fast moving, good plot and a great ending. I got to like Beauford Sloan after a few pages with him. I still can't understand why more has not been said about this book and the author. I am out to get another book by him, which looks to be his first, The Eagle Heist. This Austin has been hiding behind a film camera until now. I recommend this book. I am a avid reader."
5,Austin's Beauford Sloan is becoming a favorites.,"Raymond Austin is now one of my favorite authors. I was thrilled when I found out he had a new book out, 'Dead Again. The main character, Beaufprd Sloan is an extremely likable character and I found myself rooting for him the whole time. The ending has in his first book was not predictable as it is in many books I read. The endding was a complete surprise. I really enjoyed this book and felt fulfilled when it was over. Austin, and Beauford Sloan have such a wonderful way with words. I can't wait till his next book!"
3,Slippery,"the ball feels good but is very slippery once the game gets going. I hope overtime it gets better, if I could order something else I would."
4,Saves my car,I love it! The parking mat saves the back end of my minivan which I was constantly not pulling far enough into my garage. The parking mat let me know I'm far enough into my garage so that the backend of my minivan doesn't get hit with the garage door!
3,parking mat,"This mat came fast which was very good thing. The mat is very nice and wide, with a reflector that makes it very visible. I thought the mat would be heavy enough to stay in place. If you use double sided tape on the bottom it will not slide."
1,Don't waste your money,"Brought two. The whole thing is made of plastic. It arrived with cracks all over the place. Tried stacking the two together, cracked. So it's basically it's a piece of junk, and that's putting it nicely. It's not even worth the money to ship it back."
5,Excellent dictionary - Too small in size!,"Stavropoulos' dictionaries are the best available for modern demotic Greek, and the product of a truly intimate knowledge of both Greek and English. It is a great shame, therefore, that Oxford University Press, presumably for financial reasons, has produced the English-Greek volume in a significantly smaller size than its Greek-English companion, which is far more comfortable to use. The result is that the English-Greek edition, hard-bound and at about 900 pages thick, is bulky and awkward to handle, and simply does not stand on the bookshelf as a companion to the Greek-English edition. I sincerely hope, however, that OUP does not seek to rectify the situation by making the Greek-English as uncomfortably small in size as its English-Greek companion."
1,not what i was looking for,the Oxford English-Greek dictionary was not what I was looking for. I wanted to enter a word like Apostle and get the correct spelling in English letters for the greek word. This had Greek letters which weregreek to me.
4,Very nice,"Very pretty, the mortar has a good weight to it. My only complaint is the pestle. It almost looks like the marble design was painted on, and it feels strangely light."
5,Oldy renewed....super!,Justbought for my 6th grader as my 30 year old copy is lost somewhere in the attic...she loved it almost as much as I did...
5,Luis' Review,"I think this is a very good book because, Rachel feals that Julia wants to take over her life and Rachel thinks that Julia is a witch. Rachal feals a diconection with her familie because when Julia came to the house they all just wanted Julia more than Rachel."
5,Summer of Chills!,"If you like to read horror and suspenseful books, then this is the one for you. I really enjoyed reading this book because it was like a puzzle. The reader had to put all the pieces together to solve the mystery. It kept me on my toes while I was reading it. The first 100 pages were a little slow, but they still held my interest to keep reading. I wanted to know what was going to happen! I could easily relate to the characters because they were teen-agers. They had the same problems as I do. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
5,Great Journal,"What a great journal! I'm 54 years old and decided to start writing down things I've learned over the years. I hope to fill the journal and leave it to my children . . . and grandchildren . . . and great grandchildren . . . you get the picture.Every time I open this journal to write in it I feel as though I'm a scribe writing wisdom down from my life, to be shared with future generations. It's a humbling, yet exciting feeling. I love this journal."
2,An unconvincing argument,"The author does a decent job of presenting a historical overview of the Assassins and Templars, but then spends only a couple of pages trying to convince the reader of the connection between the two groups. In the end, no evidence is offered to convince the reader of his argument. At best, his explanation is that the teachings of the Assassins are similar to Western esotericism, and since the Templars were in the Middle-East at around the same time, they must have brought the teaching back to Europe. No evidence is given regarding any interaction between the two groups, any similarities in ideas or practices, or that even the Templars had anything to do with Western esotericism. Where's the evidence beyond the author's blind speculation?"
5,history,"he gives you a history lesson of both sides FIRST, so we have a context. it's a little tedious but still a GOOD book. even if you don't want to know about the Templar's, you'll get a ""brief"" history of the middle east in the time of the crusades."
1,Weird,"The title doesn't infom you, but this odd-ball book was written for the occult reader. Look at the back cover, it has praise from such luminaries as ""Magus of the Gold Dawn"", ""High Priest Emeritus, Temple of Set"", and ""Sublime Dopesmoker of the Holy Trip"". Give this book a skip!"
2,overrated fluff,"What can you expect from a book that receives glowing reviews not from actual critics and reviewers, but from people like ""Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Ordo Templi Orientis?"" A book the introduction of which lapses inexplicably into a discussion of Waco and the Branch Davidians? Answer: not much.Wasserman seems to belong to the ""just memorize the names and dates"" school of historiography, and the reader is left to wonder why someone so seemingly invested in the ""Western esoteric tradition"" is so satisfied with such a glib account of its origins. Wasserman's ""more than seven years [of] research"" apparently consisted of skimming and collating encyclopedia articles; there is absolutely no depth or coherence to this book--let alone an actual THESIS--and no attempt at synthesis or analysis. You're much better off reading Hakim Bey/Peter Lamborn Wilson, or just listening to The Secret Chiefs 3, for crying out loud."
2,"Interesting, but keep in mind...","This tale of conspiracies and secret societies are not always based on solid scholarship. Most of the information in the book was good, but some of Wasserman's assumptions and theories are a little far out. The author also liberally blends opinion and facts. Should not be used as a beginner's book. Should be read by those with some experience on the topic who can judge what is fact and conjecture/fantasy.Keep in mind that the endorsements on the back of the book are made by members of secret societies and not scholars, authorities, or academics. This is a fun read, but not a reference source."
4,Does the job but...,"Does the job like all Makita tools I have owned, but it's a bit pricey and the handle is a bit short (not enough room for all 4 fingers) for my average size American guy hands."
4,Good,"The ribbons don't really stay up no matter what you do. The shoe isn't as comfortable as I expected either. I don't like how pointed it is in the front though, hurts my poor toes after a while."
3,Light duty jig saw,"This is a well built little saw, but it is not heavy duty or solid. Unlike most Makita tools this one is a bit spooky to use. It is just not heavy enough and jumps around. It is ok for home projects but not a great tool where professional results are required. It is more like a tool to use around the house comparable with Craftsman tools, somewhat better than a Black and Decker, but not a great tool for the money. I am a contractor in Florida"
5,"12 discs of duplication, but still worth it","For a deadhead, most of this material is already in hand. If you don't know about the Grateful Dead, it is all essential. Start at the Grateful Dead movie and work forward. Then check out Festival Express and Anthem to Beauty. For a deadhead So Far and the bonus disc make it worthwhile even if you have the rest. The booklet provides a reasonably thorough and conscise overview of the video history of Grateful Dead."
1,I have to agree with the review written by the Englishmun..,"It's like, ""get over it already."" We are NOT the world. See ""I'm so bored of the USA"" by the Clash.I do however, enjoy some of the reads provided by the (rollins bday) press aside from Henri's work such as the scrawlings of Exene but honestly: NOT THAT MUCH. It's just a let down. This press and this author has been hyped beyond belief but maybe he's there for the testoterone league? This is NOT the Olympia press, and maybe it's not trying to be, but I wish there was a nineties version. Imposture or is that your real literary ""posture?"" As an ex ""punk"" with no ""hardcore"" and particularly (I'm a Yank) nationalist fidelities I'd rather listen to Spoken Word Jello Biafra exhorting us to ""Grow more Hemp."" This brouhaha is a brou without the haha or a haha without the brou. Or as Connie Stevens sang ""Who's sorry now?"""
2,This thing is huge!,"I bought this with the intention of installing it permanently on the rear glass of my Yukon to assist in hitching up to trailers. First of all, there was no place flat enough on the rear glass of this full size SUV to make it stick! Secondly, it is huge, so if I had installed it, it would block out my vision out the normal rear-view mirror. Since there are no dimensions listed, be sure to look closely at the pictures so you realize how huge this thing is. I would estimate the glass in the mirror is 7 x 8 inches and the overall size is over 12 inches long."
4,assist mirror,I have placed this one on my honda CR-V 09 with the curve rear glass at the back.It helps me a lot in backing up.But this one will work very good on cars with straight rear glass at the back.I`ve been using this kind of mirror on my other car way back before which has a straight rear glass and i wound say the visibility is much better than the curve one.Overall its vey useful to me as of now.
3,out of date product supplied,"Product supplied to clean window prior to attatching mirror (silane) has a use by date of 06/30/08. way waay out ot date.step 3 on instruction sheet says ""using the allen key provided but none wasRegards Jeff D"
1,Scoop dish,"When I received the item and opened it, it had scratches on it and was cheaply made. It was not worth the money so I sent it back for a refund and received my refund after calling to check on the status."
2,"OK for their time, but superceded by better recordings since.","There weren't many non-Russian recordings of these symphonies when this set was recorded (late 60's early 70's I believe). The second symphony is a tough listen, and the rather harsh sound here makes it tougher. The third was music rearrangedfrom another project and sounds it. The 6th symphony, in my estimation, should rank up with the much more performed and recorded 5th, and the Chout suite is typical Prokofiev. Gergiev, Rostropovich and Rozhdestvensky all do better performances in better sound, and aren't that much more expensive than these. I have to give Martinon kudos for being among the first to record some of these works though."
2,Kind of a bummer...,"I was really psyched to get this boxset, but, I've got to say that I'm a bit disapointed after viewing it. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast watching it, but THEY LEFT OUT TOO MANY CLASSIC CLIPS!?!Where was Johnny Knoxville jumping the L.A. River?Where was the Self-Defence Test?Where was the Human BBQ?Where was the shock collar? Or the Poo Poo Platter?What about the Poo Hug? Or Ehren McGhehey's No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service?And how could they have left out Eddie's Auto? Come on!It's not like they left out some obscure clips... these are some of the all-time classics!It's like releasing a Beatles Greatest Hits CD and not including She Loves You, Hard Days Night, I Am the Walrus, Hey Jude, etc.So, MTV, what gives?That said, for the $40.00 odd bucks that I payed for it, well, I had some laughs, but the let down of not seeing those clips (and most of those were the ones I was really looking forward to seeing again) just left a really bad taste in my mouth.Oh well."
5,Great product!,Great quality product! This was exactly what we were looking for. All the discs work great and it is in great condition. Very happy!
3,Not exactly as advertised,"Let me start off saying I'm a HUGE jackass fan, and I also had all these on tape before buying this for when it was $20. It was great to get it on DVD and much better quality which is why I'll say it was worth the purchase for me. However this ""Complete Boxset"" is missing dozens and dozens of skits. I watched all 3 seasons so many times over the years that I noticed some right away and had to look up the rest on google. Thankfully I still have my tapes I believe so I can go back and miss some of them that were missing. If you don't own any at all than I'd recommend this for sure. Also it claims to be ""uncensored"" and ""uncut"", but that just isn't true unless you're watching the commentary. All over the top curse words are still cut out and everything is still blurred which I guess can be expected either way. Just watched the whole set the past couple days, and although it did let me down in some ways, in many others I'm very glad I bought it overall."
4,Everything it promises,"This box set delivers everything it promises: the complete Jackass. There are lots of extra and deleted scenes, and the 4th disc has a bunch of extra features like interviews and public appearences. I especially liked the interviews about where they are now and what they're doing."
2,Regret the purchase,"It's unbelievable how these guys managed to pull the box set out without including the original series. Moreover, you have to watch the skits with the annoying beep in every bad word which is something you don't expect.On the other hand, they didn't include the best skits of the series so I don't understand why they call it ""the box set"". If you'd watch it in the ""play all"" option you could see there was no link between some of the skits because some of them were missing. It's just too dissapointing.It's better to record it off the reruns.Don't buy this box set."
1,I Hated Zen!,"Even if I'm not enjoying a book, I can almost always stick it out to the end. I quit this one 2/3 through. I just hated the main character. She's an arrogant, self-obsessed, dumb jerk, and I was rooting against her. If the story was interesting enough, I might have been able to continue the book. It wasn't. The title is the only thing about the book I liked."
5,Very Pleased,"I received these a week ago, and am very happy with them. The rims are great for drinking...they are thick but have a crisp inner rim so they are not dribble glasses. The bottoms of the glasses are finished nicely. I had previously bought some from pier one, and the bottoms were very rough like broken glass. Not these! Nicely made, very consistent and they look cute with my colorful Fiestaware. Perfect for water or a cocktail."
2,Looks better than it wears,"I had really high hopes for this product as the Baby Bjorn I was using was killing me since my baby is over 22lbs! The design was lovely (I got the Helsinki) but the product just did not feel comfortable on me. I even had a tingling muscle sensation on my shoulder after placing my baby in it for 15 mins. Also, the baby couldn't sit still, I think she did not feel as comfortable as she did on the bjorn.I think it would be great for infants but for a baby who's reached over 20lbs, probably a different carrier would work out better."
2,Essentially useless,This product would be great if it wasnt cordless. It has only enough juice to cut 3 or 4 tiles then it has to be recharged for an hour. Not recommended.
2,Not worth it,"I thought these flats would be a perfect basic black flat for work. They came and they were very small. I am usually a size 7.5 but they were very tight on. I thought if I broke them in they may fit better. I wore them for a day and they hurt, they didnt stretch and the shoe was very cheaply put together so the bow was curling up and the toe part looks strange.I could find a better looking/ upholding/ correct sized shoe on at another store/ brand."
5,Fun!,"I bought this book as a gift to a Chilean family I will be staying with this summer. I chose it because, other than captions, there is very little writing and because the pictures are gorgeous and varied. I liked it because it gave a good taste of New York -- yes, there is a picture of the Crystler Building, the statue of liberty, but there are also pictures of Dylan's Candy Bar, the Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue, etc."
5,Please make System Shock 2 remastered!,"The game is amazing. I love Shodan, the plot, voice acting. System Shock 2 is a pure gem. The only problem with it is that since it's old, you can't really play it without issues, or play it at all on new computers. I really hope to see this exact game being remastered, NOT BUTCHERED AND EDITED. I'd love to see new graphics on it, and of course play it again to feel the old good terror. Remember how ''Halo combat evolved'' was remastered into ''Halo anniversary''? It was the same game with better sounds and newer graphics, everything else was the same. I wish someone would already make a newer version of this game."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying. I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous. Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding, regenerating zombies. You aint gotta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I wouldn't be bothered. If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time. But I sure wouldn't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon."
3,A Good Review,"This game is ok. It overall entertained me for a while, but like any and every other game (except for Diablo 2 of corse )other game got booring after a while."
5,Why isn't this game more popular than Quake3?,"I have read all the reviews and played the game my self only to ask my self, why is such a perfect game on the bottom shelf of my computer game's store and why is there more Quake fans? I have only truely liked 2 games in my life: Mechwarrior2 and System Shock 2. (hey both are 2s) They are both very cool and immersing. I don't need to say all the stuff above that has been repeated many times. It is scary, mad, fun ...So somebody tell me why this game isn't as popular and famous as quake? @#?$% jf_aidan_pryde@hotmail.com"
2,bent blade,so far- one of the blades was unusable as it was bent. :( A lot of money for a bent cartridge.
3,excessive shipping fees,The razor blades that I had ordered arrived within a week of ordering. But the shipping costs almost matched the actual items that I had purchased (5 sets of 8 blades). That wouldn't be an issue if I hadn't have shipped them regular delivery and the package wasn't shipped from Brooklyn-less than 10 miles from my house.
1,These Are Garbage!,"I was so excited about the prices compared to the $23-$24 I pay for them in NYC. When they arrived, I shrugged off the German packaging. But when I used them, I knew I was had. These razors are very tough. They hurt and did a poor job. I went through several razors in the first pack, then opened the two other packs, hoping that maybe it was just one pack. But no, it was the whole lot. They all were terrible. I finally tossed them and went to my local pharmacy and bought another pack. My face feels so much better. If you think you found a good deal, Don't do it!"
1,FAKE Blades,"Do NOT buy this product. Do not buy from Infinite Surplus. These are FAKE, COUNTERFEIT products. The blades are duller than rusty tin can lids and will tear the flesh off your face. The orange lubricant strip that is on genuine Gillette blades and works wonderfully is nothing more than a cleverly colored piece of rubber on these forgery knock-offs. Demanding refund and disgusted that these prodcuts are available on Amazon."
1,not too pleased,When they arrived the glue on the boxes had let go and were open.Also the boxes were not printed in english looked like german. Dident hold an edge. would not buy again
1,Razor blades scratch my faceA,"Are these really Gillette? Imitation? Because they don't shave like a Gillette? I've used Gillette M3 Power since they came out. Never have I had this problem. I tried one blade, couldn't even finish two strokes without it pulling my beard like crazy. So I switched the blade and tried the second one out of the first tray. Both had the same problem. I tried 1 in the second tray. Same problem. I had to switch back to my 3 week old blade that shaved better and smoother than these ""brand new"" blades. Careful readers. They looked new but don't shave with them. They pull and scratch and it is painful to use them. I won't by from this ad again."
1,Lost,Gillette lost in a court of law regarding this product. All it's claims for this product have essentially been proven FALSE. Do not waste your money on this garbage!
1,Don't buy,"The reason that these are so cheep is because of there quality. The first time I used one of these it felt worse than the one I replaced, they irritated my neck and no matter how often I shave it pulls like an old dull razor blade. Eventually I thru them away and baught the more expensive ones at the store, much better. Dont waste your time and money on these!"
1,Defective CD,"Just a note to those folks who might be considering ordering this CD. I ordered it twice from two different Amazon vendors. Both copies were defective. The sellers were very gracious and refunded my money immediately. The problem with both of the CDs in this set is that the CD simply ""replays"" the first symphony on the CD over and over again - i.e., you get one symphony on each CD rather than the eight CDs total that are indicated. While I really wanted the CD set, I finally gave up as I figured that the whole batch of VoxBox CDs were defective. So, buyer beware."
1,white chi tea,"When I ordered this I thought I was getting plain white tea not a spice variety, don't really care for it."
2,Good for a While then real bad,"At first it was great. It was cheaper than a regular controller, but now I see why. Sometimes it works okay and sometimes it will move your person by itself. No good at all."
3,oops!,This controller pad has a great feel for me. I prefer this kind of controller over the Nintendo brand ones which are more expensive. The only problem that I have found with this controller is that it pushes imaginary directions such as down in the new tetris. That causes you to some times place a piece at the bottom.
4,UPDATE,"I have been contacted by them stating that my item has already been shipped and that they will send another one.I just wanted to give it an update as this changes everything.Still I have not received the item yet but am much happier for being contacted by them. Things happen, I understand that..."
4,PM,Turned out to be a great book with a lot of great information. Extremely needed as a reference if you are going into the PM workforce.
5,Buy this CD!!!!,"This CD is great!! This CD is filled with songs that all have different beats. There are some unfamiliar beats, maybe Hawiian. The beats go really well with Hoku's voice and lyrics, as well as with the song as a whole. Unlike some of the other female pop singers, Hoku can actually sing (no offense to those who think Brittany Spears can sing) in one song, she is only singing with a guitar, and she sounds really good. Her voice is different too, it is not whiney like other female singers, it is smooth and soothing. I was suprised at Hoku, she can really hit some high notes. To anyone thinking about this CD, just buy it. You will not be sorry."
1,DUMB!!!DUMB!!!DUMB!!!,"I cant believe little kids actually listen to this!And especially with a song title as ""one dumb blond,the burrito song""???(LOL)What is that all about???And another thing,avoid watching the video,it blows!!!On the other hand,get music from ""real"" artist,like Smashing Pumkins and Radiohead or something."
5,Hoku totally deserves 5 stars!,"I heard about hoku through my friend and at first I thought she just is another singer with no vocal talent but then I listened to her cd and i was like ""Wow she is good!"" i immedatly bought her cd. My favorite tracks are Oxygen , Just Enough, how Do I Feel, what you need and we will follow the sun i did not dislike any of the tracks.hoku is also a really nice person ! i just wish i could give it more than 5 stars!!!!!!!!!"
3,Maybe 2...,"Well, I got a bunch of new cd's - Grey Eye Glances, Jennifer Love, Angela Ammons, Mena... So 1 semi stinker aint to bad-definately could have lived without."
1,She stinks like a rotten burrito!,Hoku is terrible almost all of her songs sound the same! She is no Britney Spears!
2,WHO IS HOKU?,"To tell you the truth i havn't really heard much about Hoku. i heard her song ""Another Dumb Blonde"" It was ok at first but then it got really annoying and it is all you hear now! Does she have any other songs? If you want a great CD go out and get Britney Spears' ""Opps!... I did it again"" HER NEW ALBUM IS GREAT! Try to avoid albums like Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore! If you like hoku then go out and get it! ( ? )"
3,Not as good as others,This is not one of the better cookbooks in the Moosewood cook book selections. The recipes take a little to prepare and just aren't as flavorable as recipes from the other books. It's sort of a remake of other recipes in the other books. I would recommend the 30 minutes or less book over this one.
1,Don't buy into NBC's marketing scheme,"I've had enough '70s nostalgia to last the rest of my life. The same people who complained about the lousy state of affairs at the time are probably the same ones dusting off their puka shells and Farrah Fawcett posters now. NBC has poured millions of dollars into an ad campaign for a cheesy, poorly written and acted TV movie that takes a decade and paints it with the broadest, most obvious strokes possible, thus trivializing important events and hyping unimportant ones. This soundtrack, the fiftieth repackaging of mostly bland '70s rock hits that initially annoyed many of the same people who eat them up now, is just part of the ad campaign. Buying this soundtrack is just a way of encouraging NBC to continue this nauseating, revisionist history madness. Please don't let them make ""The '80s""!"
4,Keeps important papers handy,"I bought one years ago and just found these available again and bought four more. One for each of our cars and for our grown kids' cars. Now it's easy to find that 'important paperwork' easily without too much digging in the glovebox. The velcro button keeps wallet closed when in glove box, too, minimizing space used. The two clear poly pockets inside allow you to see which of documents you need to pull out or check if they are expiring, etc. I also include a 'what to do in case of vehicle accident' checklist from our insurance company to help reduce the mayhem in such a situation. Maybe I can find a 'what to do when police pull you to side of road' situation checklist?"
2,Not a very good quality,Using this product more than a month with cleanser. No improvment in the hairfall. Loosing so much hair with conditioner. will see another few months and stop if not satisfied.
3,have a huge gripe...,"This shower head delivers on all its promises of powerful sprays and water pressure sensing. However, the design of the joint doesn't allow the shower head to be pointed downward. Actually, it mostly sprays the wall. I had to rig mine with a hair clip so that it will spray directly onto me without the head falling out of the bracket (I am only 5'2''). If you are short or don't like to hold the shower head in your hand for the duration of your shower, I would not recommend this product."
4,Another Good Plot with Plenty of Unexpected Twists and Turns,"Jill McGown's style is quite wonderful! Her books are very carefully plotted and her character development is excellent. In this book we get to see Judy in action. Her careful attentiveness to detail, and her detailed notetaking help her solve this perplexing murder of a schoolgirl. Typical of Ms. McGown there are plenty of twists and we dont' discover the real murder until the very end. In the meantime we the readers have thought it was three or four different people as the plot unfolds. The title of the book is a pun on something quite relevant to the case. Read it and discover Ms McGown's wonderful world in the English midlands."
1,Try the book - not the Kindle Edition,"This is quite the most awful Kindle download that I've encountered. There are innumerable transcription/editing/grammatical/spelling errors such as to render it a most irksome read. Furthermore, since there are no contextural gaps, lines or asterisks between self-contained episodes within chapters, it becomes as much of an investigative challenge to keep characters and circumstances in some kind of perspective as it is to follow the somewhat juvenile and laborious plot. This is not in keeping with anticipated McGowan standards. Perhaps the paperback is better - but this isn't woth the price of the download."
2,Dull and Boring,"I couldn't stay awake because this book absolutely bored me to sleep. No excitement, no fun, no nothing. After all the hype I was so dissappointed, I can't stand spending money and getting nothing but a hodgepodge of, well, I still don't know exactly what. I completed the book, finally, after going to sleep on it three nights in a row (as thin as it was) and I wish I'd just gone to sleep in the first place. A total waste of time and money."
1,useless,totally misleadingIt's a just a repackaged java intro. It has nothing to teach about spatial or GIS or hardly even java
4,Excellent story telling.,"The Heroism of our soldiers and their dedication to each other stands out in this book.One example: after a mortar attack a young Pfc brings 2 of his wounded teamates downstair to be medevac'd and is going back to get another when his knees buckles and he sits down telling his 1st seargent ""I'm just plain woreout"". His 1st Seargent sees that the Pfc was wounded himself and is sitting in a pool of his own blood.Stories like the above are when this book stands out. When it is telling accounts of smaller battles and the soldiers involved; within the overall Fallujah campaign.I also could not agree more with Mr. West when he says ""There will be no true glory for our soldiers in Iraq until they are recognized not as victims, but as aggressive warriors. Stories of their bravery deserved to be recorded and read by the next generation."""
4,Compelling read,I enjoyed the insights into the complex intersections of war and politics in Iraq. The descriptions of battle are riveting. Recommended.
1,Not happy,"I am sending this book back, I just haven't been able to. I am not happy with it. It is packaged up and ready to go back. The reason is that there are no templates in it. The projects are not interesting or neat also."
1,Not what I expected.,"This is not what I expected. You can pass this one by and choose a book/pamplet with better designs and ideas. If you don't already know how to make pop-ups, you will need a book with better instructions. This book is really only useful for those that have NEVER even thought of adding pop-ups to cardmaking; very basic ideas, and not a good How-to."
1,Regret buying book,"I was so excited to find a book that did more than just show how to make the cardfronts. I thought this book would instruct on how to make cards that ""WOW"", but rather it was more of an ""oh, bummer"". I guess if you're just starting out this book is fine, but for some with a teensy bit of experience I found this book not so inspirational."
5,Very helpful,I am in a written translation course and this book has been very helpful when translating from Spanish into English.
4,A Mean Little Monster,"If you do a lot of low-level home improvement, this is a great saw!I mostly do panel work, trim, and small woodworking. Usually, a full-size circular saw is too cumbersome, and the flimsy blade of a jigsaw makes it hard to maintain a consistent line.This little monster cuts through ANYTHING, and the carbide blade stays sharp and comes back for more. It's easy to get a clean, straight cut on everything from 1/2"" plywood to delicate formica. Even a bevelled edge comes out nice.The only downside is a short life-span on the battery's charge. But all in all a handy and dependable saw."
2,Don't like this one at all,"I bought for trim work, but it doesn't work very well for anything but maybe drywall. The cordless 5 3/8 & 5 1/2 saws with a fine tooth blade blows this away. The one is buried alomg with other mistakes I bought over the years."
2,Boring,I found this book really boring and I thought the dialogue was horrible at times. The relationship between the main character and her husband seemed strange and forced most times. There sex scenes seemed cold and unfeeling nothing like what you would imagine a loving couple would be like. I just really couldn't get into the book I thought the way it was written destroyed the whole story. I got this while it was free which is a good thing. Not worth in my opinion any more than .99 cents.
4,Great Workout Equipment for Home use!!,"I love this treadmill, we bought it about a year ago and get great workouts on it! My husband is over 250 lbs and he has no problem with it...it is built to sustain over that amount and he actually runs on it! We have had no problems with the Z9 Treadmill and will continue to use it for years to come. The only reason I rated it at 4 stars is because it is for home use....otherwise if it was in the gym I would rate it at 5 stars!"
5,Just what I needed.,They are just what they are advertized as. They worked for the two items I needed them for with no problems.
5,Seem OK,Bought for my garage door opener. Item arrived in a legal envelope from vendor. All seems good. Have not used one yet.
3,Handy saw with a major limitation,"The first job I tackled with this saw involved plunge cuts in the walls of my deer blind. In spite of my extensive carpenter experience I found it almost impossible to plunge into the material (1/2 in. plywood) without a kick-back. I am very disappointed with this limitation. If not plunge cutting, this saw generally works very well for material up to 3/4"" thickness."
4,A great book about a great series,"Informative, with lots of behind-the-scenes information and pictures, this book is a must-have for any Planet Of The Apes fan. I enjoyed the information on alternate scripts (and wished there had been MORE of this information, but that's assuming that more even exists), and liked that the authors included some of the original reviews for the films -- a nice touch. Several of the cast and crew were interviewed for the book, and the book itself is well written. A good read."
5,Very Impressed @ This Classic!,"I couldn't believe when I first took a listen to this album at the production and lyricism presented on it! Kurupt is back, whether Death Row supports this album or not! I urge everyone to listen to the reviews of fans calling it a classic, because they are NOT just saying that. We all waited years for this album to drop and wanted it to be hot so bad... well it was worth the wait. What a surprise... ESPECIALLY from Death Row. Kurupt still got it!STAND OUT TRACKS (to me):Anarchy '87Throw Back Muzic '86Deep DishesMy HomeboysCalicoYou ****** With The BestCOP THIS! IT'S BETTER THAN YOUR EXPECTING, TRUST ME!"
1,Kurupt?,"Honestly, this album is whack, I don't know why the other reviewers seem to like it, but if you've been a fan of DPG long enough, AND has actually listened to Space Oddyssey- which I consider a classic, you would agree with me that with the expection of Homeboys, this album suffers bad production, untalented rappers featuring, not to mention Kurupt's subpar lyrical performance.Hopefully his reunion with Daz brings better music than this"
2,Corny,After a few songs all of them sound alike. This should not be the case. There are much better CDs and compilations to be had out there.
5,"If there is no God, everything is allowed","This is broooootal super sick stuff! Harsh, relentless, disturbing. One of the most startling psychological horror flicks in recent years. Called Germany's Silence of the Lambs.Berlin police arrest a deranged psychopath suspected of molesting and killing 13 children. This sadistic freak's name is Gabriel, and he refuses to speak to anyone except Michael Martens, an honorable officer from a small town. As his reasons for this becomes evident, your comfort level will get severely rattled. The prisoner knows some unsettling secrets about Michael's son, and the truth will envoke rage and fear from all that are exposed.Antibodies is superbly directed and acted. It deals with some harsh topics that obviously won't appeal to many viewers. But in reality, evil knows no boundaries. More gruesome, twisted, and real than many care to endure.Evil is a virus. It's highly contagious, and you're already infected..."
3,antibodies,"i thought the movie was okay.nothing special,or to write home about.i really would not recommend it to anyone.norman reedus is only in it a little bit at the beginning anyway."
1,Lame!,"I love psychological thrillers, but this is is not one of them. The ending sucked! Thats all I can say about it...Dont waste your money renting..."
3,Super cute & fun but small,"Just got this to go with our ensemble of ""little bunny foo foo"" puppet characters and the book. I loved that I could have 3 mice in one puppet, to all be bopped on the head. It is a very cute puppet and clever having all 3 mice in the box. However, my dissappointment was that it was much smaller than expected. Maybe it will fit small hands fine-though I am small for an adult, the size of an average 5th grader....you can't fit your whole hand underneath, only three fingers, one for each mouse. So your thumb and pinky are left exposed and...the fingers can't fit all the way to the end of the puppet (each mouse's nose) to get full motion. The box stops my hand from having full movement and leaves it showing partially. Anyways, it is a nice item, just a lot smaller, and seems more delicate as well. Not sure it will hold up to a lot of kid activity and handling, but we'll see."
2,I've read better...,"... pertraits of life in graduate medical education. This text certainly has its place as the experiences of a female doctor, but all told it was rather innocuous."
5,Great CD. All the songs are good ones.,"Paul Thorn is a wonderful singer, songwriter. His songs are humorous, meaningful, touching."
1,What were they thinking?,"Yes, I fell for the packaging....the giant head, the flexible extension.What a joke. The extension was impressive until the head was attached.Then it simply wilted. No amount of pulling and twisting would keep the head up. Perhaps the manufacturer needs to work on keeping the hose stiff."
2,Did not really clean up mascara,"I thought that since I purchased the Ocusoft mascara along with this Ocusoft remover, that it would at least clean up their own particular mascara. Unfortunately, after using, it leaves me with racoon eyes, needing more rubbing with another product, defeating the whole purpose of the remover. The ocusoft mascara is great, though, and does not irritate my eyes as does all other types I have tried."
5,"The Crazy 8's ruled the crazy 80's (in Portland, anyway)","Instead of giving a history of the band Crazy 8's (go to Wikipedia for that) I will just give some of my memories. This album was the first by the band. I had it on LP record in college at WWU (Bellingham, WA). It was never published on CD in it's original form so finding this on-line years later (20th Anniversary edition) was quite a treat. The album cover was even updated to include the presidents thru ""W"" Bush. As great as the songs on this album are, the 8's were even better live. I saw them probably at least a handful of times in Bellingham, Seattle, and Portland back in the day. They were best taken in at Key Largo in Portland, one of their regular haunts. Hope y'all enjoy it."
2,The Word Ends,I found the story a bit trite and boring. You might want to spend your money on another movie.
2,Boring,"This movie was boring and contrived. I thought it would be good, but it was mostly sophomoric. I'm not saying the writer/director is talentless; I'm just saying, it coulda' been better."
1,Poor choice,"After greasing the pan liberally, my lemon poppy seed muffins still stuck like CRAZY! I was so upset, I trashed the pan. One and done. Waste of money."
2,"havent used yet, but cavities bent....","I havent used this yet, but I usually use wilton pans, and their quality is good as well as finished products(baked goods) which come out great. Problem is upon receival of this product through the mail, most the individual cavities were BENT inwards. Odd for wilton quality (aluminum - but apparently super thin!!!!), leaving me LESS ROOM in the already small cavity for batter. NOT sure how finished product will turn out. Too lazy/pricey to return."
3,disadvantages of aluminum,"I hadn't anticipated that this aluminum pan would be quite so flimsy. I once had a muffin pan much the same, and it didn't take too many times of loosening the muffins to put a table knife clear through one of the depressions. If you put cake or muffin batter in these, even with Pam spray, be gingerly when you go around the edge to loosen the contents of the mini loaf."
5,Great Speakers,"I've owned a pair of these for years. They are hooked-up to a sub woofer, and they sound better than the $1000. speakers that are being sold today. You will not be sorry you bought them."
4,"Great value, Good sound",I bought these to subpliment my surround sound speakers and they fit in my entertainment stand. They provide good sound and weren't that expensive. Not the greatest sound but definitely enough for my needs.
3,"Good for some, Not for others","I bought this guided meditaton to assist me in reaching a meditative state in which I could conduct my dicursive meditation as practiced by some Druids. The ""Journey"" as it turns out centers on a passage taken from the Bible in the Book of Matthew, Chapters 5 and 13. ""The Kingdom of Heaven, which lies within you"" is the passage.This would make for excellent meditation for someone who is Christian or follows Christian Gnosticism. I myself am Druidic. Therefore being of Pagan belief and not necessarily believing in ""Heaven"" per se, I found the theme distracting and ineffective at inducing my meditative state.Therefore, for me, it was no effective, but it would be ideal for some of different faiths. My advice, if you are pagan, go with some plain New Age music or record your own narrated guided meditation."
5,Excellent book on Majolica,"Clear, concise, lots of nice photos. Not incredibly detailed, but it isn't designed to be."
3,Just pretty pictures,"This book is filled with lovely pictures of Majolica. Unfortunately it is not filled with the kind of information that I was looking for as a collector. I would have liked to see pictures of the marks he describes. Also, I am very disappointed he did not discuss how to recognize new Majolica-like pieces and/or fakes."
2,Ho hum another one,"Rehash same old ideas, quote Warren buffett, regurgitate the same info you can get anywhere. Worst of all. Tell us to know everything you need to know to make you valuable to customers. Then tell you to invest by yourself because brokers are all crooks and are of no value. Hmm. Maybe a little jaded since I am a broker. Most people can't do that on their own. The ones that do must commit hours and hours of research. Gee, isn't that what I get paid to do for you so you can go about you own life? Have I not learned everything I need to know to be successfull?"
2,"A few quality tracks, but....","This cd has a few anthems that makes this cd worth something but the others are just cheesy and not good. Don't waste your money on this one, go and get something from Sasha, digweed, Seamen, or one of my favs D:fuse. You'll get quality tracks, quality mixing and best of all, no cheese."
3,Useful but flawed reference book,"There are many rare pictures and valuable data in this book. However, it is not a very complete reference. There is too much emphasis on serial dramas (soap operas). For example, the ""Story of Mary Marlin"" has as much space devoted to it as ""The Jack Benny Show"", perhaps the most popular radio comedy of all time. There is no entry for ""The Phil Harris and Alice Faye Show"" for some unknown reason. A minor complaint is the tiny type in my 1973 Avon trade paperback edition. I must use a magnifying glass to read this book. The book makes a worthwile supplement to standard old radio reference works by John Dunning and others. As commented by another reviewer, the foreward by Henry Morgan is very good. Overall, I rate it only 3 stars, but I am happy to have added it to my library of books about old time radio."
2,I don't care for these at all,"I really don't like these. They are weak in that sweet, cinnamon flavor, and do not last long at all.It's really a shame the[...]gent passed away. He had the absolute best cinnamon toothpicks money could buy."
5,Hot! Hot! Hot!,These little toothpicks are big on taste. No tea-tree oil or other flavor additives to interfere with the pure cinnamon flavor. My husband has been using them to quit smoking and says they've helped more than any thing else. Popping a toothpick in his mouth when the craving hits has helped him get past the urge to smoke. Candy Crate provides fast service too. They shipped and delivered as promised.
2,Disappointed with product,They tasted more like chemically treated toothpicks than actually coated with cinnamon. I would not buy this product again.
1,Blamn it!!,"In addition to the Blam garbage they also include the classic cartoons (which have all been previously released on DVD) and include cut versions which are down to about three minutes with new recored dialogue, new music and new sound effects. In addition, the uncut version is also included. This stuff is okay for the children, but not the adults. All we want is classic Disney not classic Disney being tampered with. If it aint broke then don't fix it!!"
2,watch directions!,I made a cardigan sweater which is very cute but found multiple errors in the directions! So many that I would not make any further items from this expensive book. Beware.
4,Bobbles for little girls,I have started the sweater for little girls and boys which includes bobbles for the girls sweater. The directions for the bobbles were very detailed and were very easy to follow. I am using pink and purple for the girls sweaters and blues and greens for the boys sweaters. I have decided having a couple of cute babies gifts ready for deliver is the way to go.I have been knitting for almost five years and have become addicted to all the wonderful yarns that are out there. My stash certainly has some wonderful things to make including many patterns in this wonderful book.
2,Garden Stone,This book was nice to look out but didn't really give me what I was looking for. I wanted some ideas on using stone with running water.
4,Really liked this movie,"A nice movie about continuing to live your life with passion into your sunset years. Good acting, good stories. I would recommend this movie to all adults."
2,Amazon Instant View,Movie kept stopping to stream. Finally had to stop and start completely over. Took 3 hours to watch 2 hour movie. The movie itself? Great actors in an implausible story.
4,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"Excellent movie. Very thought provoking with an all star cast. The movie was also very well directed. However, it was a zone 2 movie coming from America I was only able to view it on my computer."
4,Really liked this one!,This was enlightening! Really different. I like the setting and all of the different people and how they interacted with one another.
2,Expected More,"I had read about this movie and seen trailers for it, I was very disappointed with the movie. What a wonderful cast to be used for such a lousy movie."
3,Okay for the dedicated film buff,"More chaotic than structured, more implausible than convincing, and its happy ending is welcome for its being gratifyingly final. What redeems the movie are the reliably solid performances of Judy Dench and Maggie Smith. Its other virtue is characterization; insights here and there into the variations and subtleties of that ubiquitous emotion we call love. I would recommend The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to the dedicated film buff. Others may want to take a pass."
3,Ok,Are defently better films out there to watch. The film is a slow starter that begins to grow on u in the end. There
4,Good Actors!,The was a nice movie but a little more sad and depressing than its ads would indicate. But on the other hand you can't beat the quality of actors and their mastery of the acting medium.
2,Glad to see great older actors getting paid,"When HD first came out, I predicted that it would be the end of several TV/movie careers: David Hasellhoff as a 30-something leading man, Regis Philbin as anything, for example,I didn't predict that actors would just swallow their vanity (they are actors, after all) and parade their wrinkles for the Hi-Def cameras. I sympathize somewhat, since I'm chronologically in the same zip code, but short of their being in need of the money, I see no reason for them to participate in projects like this. We count on the people emoting on screen being a lot better looking than us. We can tolerate Judi Dench as ""M"" but not as a love interest.Please let us have our cinematic fantasies!"
4,Something to snack on,Very nice film. Not an over the top Indian movie but well balanced.Great characters. A bit rushed in spots but like a light novel it was a Quick read.
4,Low key escapism,Good actors make a not so ambitious ''travel'' movie very watchable. Not a big issue plot orthriller but occasionally makes one think a little about the meaning of life. Better than one expects.
5,Visually nice and interesting movie,"I love movies that focus on aging and life after retirement. This movie could have gone longer with more interesting character development, but for the time involved it was a great watch."
3,Predictable,"Although I enjoyed the fine cast, the story line has been told many times in far better ways.. Some of the characters scripts seemed old and tired rather than new and fresh."
4,Great Feel Good Movie,This was the second time that I had seen this movie but the first for my husband. We both loved it. The only problem was it did not play well starting with the last 30 minutes. We had to reset several times.
5,Wonderful Movie!,"If you want a really great movie to watch, then I highly recommend this movie. It is very seldom anymore that I enjoy a movie as much as I enjoyed this one. There were no special effects, just great acting and great dialogue!"
5,Great cast & Movie,Being a retired Geazer i related well to the movie and circumstances of the individuals! The setting was beautiful as were the surrondings.
3,Missed Opportunity,We ordered this because we love this genre.We were disappointed with the screenplay/script which did not give the stellar cast the chance to shine. The movie committed the worst offense of all: It was BORING. I cannot recommend it.
3,Enjoyable but too predictable.,"After all the characters are introduced you know basically what is going to happen.But it is not terrible. Well done, nice story of life type movie."
3,"The ""Best"" Exotic.......","This was interesting, funny, andat points touching until the seeminglyinevitable gay element was thrown in.This happily politically incorrect viewerwas unhappy."
3,Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"The movie was enjoyable, but I found it disappointing. Perhaps I was expecting too much with Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton among the cast. I enjoy their performances tremendously in ""Downton Abbey."""
2,To much hipe,"Not up to the Hollywood hope it got , was a little slow , and if not aware of India's way of life may not get it . Great collection of Actors . Can be a pleasant evening with nothing being blown up"
5,Best movie I have seen in years,"Best movie I have seen in years. All acting was top notch. The plot was thorough and realistic. Each character was fully fleshed out (love them or hate them).This movie was clearly not written for the hormone ridden youth that most movies seem to be written for these days. You will likely watch the movie in silence, but have quite a bit to say about it afterwards. Good couples movie for couples that have some life experience under their belts. It ends as expected, with both sadness and hope."
5,Loved it wanted it to go on,Really excellent feel good movie that would love to see turned into a mini series. More of this PLEASE! Pretty PLEASE!
5,Great acting ... setting in India,Excellent acting from great cast ... several interesting story lines with some unexpected twists and turns. Definitely worth the watch.
4,Charming Movie,"Well, I did enjoy this movie while my husband ended up going to bed halfway thru it. The movie is about a group of people and the ways they choose to get on with their lives while staying in India. The hotel everyone has chosen to stay at is most definitely a work in progress for its young owner. The characters and their humor gives this movie a warm and positive feeling. This is not a thrill a minute movie but floats you along for a quick trip to a place where in the end everything works out. Don't some of us need that from time to time? Least I forget I shall watch this more than once and apparently for my husband this is a great sleep aid so it does double duty."
4,Loved it,I love this movie but then again I'm a huge fan of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. It was a lot of fun and I will watch it again
5,Moving and Funny Flick,I saw this movie in a theater and really enjoyed it. The characters are well-drawn and well-acted. This is a feel good movie and I purchased the DVD as a gift for a friend.
1,Don't waste your time,"I can only think that the prominent actors and actresses who signed up for this film now regret it. Hackneyed and cliched, it says nothing insightful about real life or the experience of aging. Well, you don't just recover from hip replacement without a lot of rehab and risk of reinjuring yourself. And there is a reason the elderly live in old age homes. They protect them from the risk of falls, crime and dementia, real risks that never would show up in a movie like this, where characters only die painlessly after they have fulfilled their lifelong desires, and no one is infirm. Two hours of this and you'll want all the time back."
5,Loved this movie!,"The cast was superb. The story shows how a group of elderly people react to problems of growing older and also plays up the problems of socialized medicine in Great Britain. They travel to India to stay in the Exotic Marigold Hotel. The young man who runs the hotel refuses to give up on his dream, and the group help him realize the dream. Am looking forward to the sequel. Was able to rent the DVD and enjoyed it so much I bought one for myself."
5,LOVED IT!,This is such a great movie. I saw it in the theater and had to see it again. Do yourself a favor and watch.
3,Good movie but not as good as the book,"I was excited to watch the movie 1. all the fantastic actors 2. I loved the book. The acting and movie itself was very good. If I hadn't had read the book I would have given the movie 4 stars - but - since I read the book I was disappointed in the movie. The movie changed so many things and wasn't nearly as personal or gripping. The book pulls you into the story.....the movie leaves you feeling as if your watching from the outside. The book had you feeling as if you knew each person and how their lives all came to be connected....the movie just throws them together - and then the changes that were made just took away from the story. Watch the movie to see a decent film, but read the book to really experience The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The book is much better."
3,a little slow but delightful,"Although slow moving, the movie is a sweet message about retirement and the emotions of this change to ones lifestyle."
5,Superb!,"What's not to like? Superlative acting, a wonderful story, a delightful setting and just the right balance between realism and humor."
5,Fun & Encouraging,"This is a wonderfully made movie with an encouraging message to follow your dreams and never give up. It was fun, exciting and gives you hope. I would recommend this movie for the whole family, however younger children might not find it as interesting as the adults, but the content is safe for kids too."
4,Good message for boomers,Delightful story that reminds us that life is nor over until it is over. There is live after living what is expected
5,For an older crowd - but wonderful,"I saw this at the movies (I go to the movies at least 40 times a year), and had to add it to my DVD/Blu Ray collection. The actors do a wonderful job, and I certainly could relate to some aspects of the stories. I was intrigues by the young, energetic man who runs the hotel -- how great would this world be if everyone had his glass-full optimism!!"
5,Uplifting,This was my first Purchase from Amazon stream. The process worked better than expected. The movie was very uplifting. I was filled with hope and took some of the lessons very much to heart. Watch it.
3,okie dokie,its an okie dokie movie..not so great ...can be watched just once....or may be my choice is not so good
4,movie rental,"So nice that I could just rent this through Amazon since it wasn't in the red box or DVD express in my tiny, remote town! I enjoyed this movie."
4,The Best exotic Marigold Hotel,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a delightful movie. At first I saw it with several women at the theater, liked it so much and bought it. I got my husband to watch it with me. He was pleasantly surprised. It was tender, funny, filled with lessons to be learned, too. We both loved it."
1,chaotic and annoying,"I looked forward to a pleasant movie to enjoy. Instead I was turned off completely after the first few minutes. One never got a good grasp of who these people were to begin with, and how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy. Suddenly they are all together on a plane for India. The background noise is loud and ugly and one simply wishes for it to cease. Their arrival is chaotic in a bad sense, the movie doesn't take long enough to make the few points it has to make, and the Indian proprietor hops and jumps around for no particular reason. Smith and Dench and the rest are fine actors but the script doesn't give them any way to show this. I finally decided it was a total loss and dumped the CD into the trash. Great actors, bad script and terrible direction."
5,Truly the Best!,"I love the cast, and the story line is both hilarious and touching.I will be buying this on DVD soon.Great acting and beautiful scenery!"
3,Great Acting Script Weak,"You will want to watch this just to see the fabulous cast. They are the best. The script is weak though and would have had easy fixes. So who edited this thing? Some scenarios just weren't necessary, i.e. the guy finding the local British gal for a late in life connection. Really, in love just like that? Just not realistic. But the acting was superb!"
2,Where are the bonus tracks?,"Having bought the record (vinyl) when this first came out, and then the CD, it would take bonus tracks to entice me to buy it again. The same goes for the album Breaking Hearts. I know that there was a lot of other stuff by Elton at this time (extended version of Red shoes), a live version of Grape Vine etc. These things should have been included as bonus tracks."
3,Decent Comeback,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer below. This may not be a great Elton John record, but it's the closest thing we have to Elton returning to his mid-70's form. It's got some up-tempo rockers (Dear John, I'm Your Robot), along with some wonderful pop numbers (Empty Garden, Blue Eyes, Where Have All the Good Times Gone). There's only one stinker, Princess (very cheezy sounding). I'm amazed that Jump Up is rated lower by Amazon members than Elton's other 80's albums (who in the world thinks Ice on Fire is a 5 star album?). To be honest, even Too Low For Zero (the album that usually gets all the praise for being Elton's best 80's effort) sounds uninspired and workmanlike. Jump Up, though, is the last album where we get to here EJ having fun because it all goes downhill from here."
1,Silly little trifle,"This is a silly little book. The ideas are a poorly written patchwork with little real guidance. It is the equivalent of many of the ""spam"" mail scams that we constantly receive offering ""work at home opportunities""I believe the writer takes advantage of people looking for solid advice. It is difficult enough for people trying to survive, be it as an actor, musician or whatever without shelling out money for such a mis-guided and simple minded product.Apparently from what I read the author quit the entertainment industry and becam a Cantor (which was not listed as one of the 154 ways to make money), so apparently the advice in the book did not work for her!Save your hard earned money, don't waste your time on this book."
4,Coming of Age,"Looking for a Holiday gift for a young adult? This may be the book for you. Great for high school or college age students who are faced with choices to make about careers or giving in to peer pressure. Also recommended for any parent of a young adult. Are we parenting to fulfill OUR dreams, or to assist our offspring to obtain THEIR purpose? Also, very telling about continuing more subtle segregation (not limited to racial) in our society."
3,"Nice book, but impractical for the beginner","I purchased Yoga Mind and Body as a beginner wanting to explore. I was pleased to see clear illustrations of the exercises, as well as other suggestions on yogic living. However, I am disappointed that so many of the exercises are too difficult for the beginner. This book is cumbersome to flip through while exercising, and concentration is needed outside of holding the book open. It takes over an hour to complete the whole sequence in the book. While I understand the unrushed pace is the whole point, it is very difficult to find one hour each day to devote to the exercises alone. In addition, some of the practices the book mentions have to be done with guidance from an instructor, as they are dangerous. My suggestion to the beginner is to find another book."
5,Outstanding!!!!,"I had a wonderful time reading it and I couldn't put it down until the last word was read! I deffinetly will re-read this book sometime in the future, so for now it will grace my keepers shelf. Thank You Connie Brockway for writing such a wonderful romance!! I will wait with baited breath for the other, can't wait for them to come out! Please hurry up!"
4,"A good read, not too ""trashy""","I was looking for some light reading and this book fit the bill. The story of Ash and Rhiannon kept me turning pages. The intimate scenes were well done; a romance not a trashy novel. I still have some questions to be answered by the sequels, which I am looking forward to reading. I'm glad that I discovered Ms. Brockway's work."
2,A brief review of The Passionate One,As a diehard Connie Brockway fan I was more than a little disappointed with this latest effort. As usual her hero Ash was suitably tortured and smouldery however our heroine Rhiannon seemed rather lacklustre compared to other Brockway heroines eg Desdemona in As You Desire. There seemed little of the soul wrenching connection I associate with her love stories. In a way this novel came across as much more formulaic with less thought to the rounding out of her characters especially in Rhiannons case. Here's hoping she is saving herself for the next in the trilogy The Reckless One.
1,Inaccurate Weight,"Just bought this. Every time you weigh the baby, you get different numbers. The variation is large enough that it makes it useless to track the weight of your baby. The baby was of course moving but no more than one would expect for a baby who is lying on a scale. My doctor's weighing scale is much better. This is a complete waste of money if your are using it for a baby. I also tried to weigh an object and found an 80 gram variation based on where I put the object on the scale. Unacceptable.Too bad because Graco generally makes good products."
4,Excellent Low Cost Scale,"We use this scale for our pet rabbits and it works very well for this. It works fine, is simple to use, and the price was right."
2,caution,"This item is attractive looking but the one I received didn't work. It quickly weighed 4 pints of water as 4.6 pounds. Not accurate, but close enough for checking on gain/loss which is what we are concerned about. But the baby was another matter. The scale took much more time to reach ""hold"" and give a weight. It gave wildly different weights as we tested it over two days. The last weight we got at the medical office was 11 pounds 8 ounces. The sale gave the following weights: 11.4, 9.6, 10.38, 11.2. This is obviously of no help. Of course, the baby moved his arms and legs, but did not squirm and was not in distress. And babies do move a bit."
3,Variable weights,"This scale is light, easy to store, and simple to use. The shape of it makes it good for infants who lie down as well as older ones who can sit. Gives quite variable weights even if used for the same weight three times in a row. If you are really concerned about your child;s weight gain would recommend buying a more expensive professional medical scale. If you are simply keeping a rough tally of weight gain then quite okay."
1,another lame camera work job,"Close-ups of band members playing backup while the lead guitarist is wailing away is frustrating to say the least.WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN! SOMEBODY START A SCHOOL FOR THESE IDIOTS!notice nobody in here with 4-5 stars notes this, its like to many people are easily pleased. shameA good example of concert producing and camera work is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 03 and pick and Austin City Limits concerts on PBS. why is this so complicated to learn? one would think a monkey could do this right."
4,"The Living Sea, Part 2","Sting and Steve Wood do it again. Mr. Wood uses the best parts of Sting's songs to arrange the musical score for Dolphins. I really enjoy the ""When We Dance"" versions of the score in ""When Dolphins Dance"". Overall a great soundtrack. Still not as good as ""The Living Sea"" (That's why it got 4 stars), but a must to have for any Sting fan."
2,Title Should Be HUMANS,"I bought this thinking it would have music and sounds related to DOLPHINS.It was full of HUMAN songs and messages, and especially those of the HUMAN ""popular"" variety.THe only thing I can mention as good about it is the short segments of fine instrumental interludes and the information of the CD brochure that tried to give hints on how to protect and care for DOLPHINS and especially injured DOLPHINS.LOVE DOLPHINS...but give the HUMAN CD a miss..."
5,Dolphins MacGilvray Film and Soundtrack is AWESOME!,"This film and soundtrack is incredible. It's a must have. If you have a big screen TV, I recommend this, The Living Sea, AND all the MacGilvray films and soundtracks...they are the best of the best. The music is so incredible on The Living Sea, I listen to it all the time, and the music on the Dolphins CD is positive, uplifting, and brings you right to the ocean! LOVE it! Ciao, Donna"
3,great little drill,"It's only a 7.2 volt drill but is slim, compact, and comes with 2 batteries. Pretty decent torque, average speed. Great for normal household duties like drilling wood, screws into wood, etc, although I used it to drill through 1/8"" steel and a 2"" hole saw through plywood. I wouldn't rely on it for heavy duty jobs, though. The chuck doesn't have a great grip, but for what it is, well worth the money compared to the other similar drills/drivers. It is a Makita, not your Home Depot bulk sale cheapo drill."
3,For MFK fans,More than a bit outdated in terms of recipes and ingredients (fashions do change in cooking practice) but none the less the writing about French cooking 50 years ago is a treat for MFK Fisher fans.
5,Excellent book with some great suggestions (bad title though),"Despite the title (which I didn't like), I thought this book was one of the better ones I've read - it was well written and fun to read and gave me a lot of ideas as to things to do and consider and taught a lot (e.g., it never for a minute occurred to me that our wooden deck (which came with the house) might be made of arsenic-treated wood that could hurt our son). As someone who reads a lot of parenting books, I can highly recommend this one as one of the best and best written!"
2,shallow and out of date,"I bought this book sight unseen as a present for my niece, but gave it away to a local charity instead. Much of the material is out of date (it predates the fall of the Soviet Union, and the explosion of archaeological discovery that has happened since then in Central Asia), and the book itself is poorly produced --- the printing is fuzzy, and many of the images look like third-generation photocopies."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"This book has pictures and illustrations for everything! Easy to understand, well written. Many wonderful ideas to try with a little practice."
3,Overly-Romanticized,"The book is overly romanticized and cheesy. The protagonists are one-dimensional and made to be helpless little softies in a cruel lonely world. The real people weren't as simple nor as naive.For a real glimpse into the lives of the music read their autobiographies or (if they haven't written an autobiography) direct interviews. Books like Miles by Miles Davis, To Be or Not to Bop by Dizzy Gillespie, Straight Life by Art Pepper, Coltrane on Coltrane, and many others give you a much realer perspective of the musicians and the wonderful music we call jazz. Jazz is deep and reflects life and its community, and it is deep and beautiful without the need for romanticism."
5,Tokyo Train Girl Movies are Fun!,"I really like the Tokyo Trail Girl movies. This particular episode is no exception. Beautiful model/actresses are pleasent to watch and do their best to be sincere.The whole idea of molesting beautiful women on trains is absurd, but somehow is something that appeals to me. While never a reality, there is something exciting about viewing the slow and deliberate exploration of the beautiful models.I like a refreshing approach to the ""porn-like"" movies and the Tokyo Train Girl movies bring it off without the gross sweaty flesh over boobed chick movies that are in abundance.So far I know of only four of these movies on DVD. If there are more please let me know."
2,Drill is Getting Old,"I loved this drill when it came out, but it is outclassed by the newer Makita t-handle 12 and 14 volt drills. The newer drills have nicer chucks, chargers, batteries, and balance. I also like the more compact size of the newer drills."
5,Music Teacher at your hands,"The best option is always to have a music teacher whenever you want learn a musical instrumnetexceptions is applied when you choose to read Alfred booksI ordered the three books and I just received my first book (LEVEL ONE) and I'm very happy with the bookstart with these 3 levels and then go to Carl Humphries's book (The Piano HANDBOOK)http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879307277/ref=ox_ya_oh_productdon't go far, those are the books you need to learn piano. (excellent introduction to the piano world)Thanks"
5,Very practical book...,"This book should prove helpful to someone who might be wavering on where to draw the line with music in his ministry. Helpful suggestions for keeping CCM out of your church are also included, which make it a valuable asset to a pastor or youth pastor attempting to maintain or establish standards in his ministry. The author's experience and testimony lends weight to his case, giving an insider angle that many preceding volumes on the subject cannot offer. The book's modest size (141 pages) and practical, everyday language also make it ideal to give to someone who might be struggling with this issue in their personal lives."
5,Finally a book written from the inside.,"This book ought to be in the hands of every music minister. The authors have written an insightful and powerful book when it comes to dealing with the inner workings of the CCM movement. Having ministered in various churches over the past 23 years, I have seen the introduction of this type of music and the subtle and not so subtle destruction it brings in the life of the congregation and family relationships. When Balaam couldnt bring a curse upon the children of Israel then he counseled Balak to put a stumbling block in the way of Israel by way of corrupting them with the 'contemporary' culture of that time. This should be a clear warning from scriture for our time also.This is a highly charged emotional issue and those that stand for the truth must do so with patience and an understanding heart - without a trace of compromise. May God bless the fruits of this much needed work."
1,"Well, now we know","To be fair to the author, the book's title does not suggest that the book is a scholarly or biblically exhaustive treatment of worship music. And it isn't.As someone who thinks an argument might be able to be made for limiting the genres of music suitable for corporate worship, I was hoping for an insightful (or at least thoughtful) reflection on the nature of music and its use in the church. I was hoping for something akin to John Frame's book, Contemporary Worship Music: A Biblical Defense -- only from a different perspective. This is not that book.My lackluster response after reading Why I Left the Contemporary Christian Music Movement is, ""Well, now we know."""
3,290 DEGREEs???,I know that few bucks won't give you superior quality. I received this peephole viewer. I don't see 290 degrees because there is no way you can see both sides of my house. I know it is a piece of false information. It works like 190 degree only.
5,Look Out for Catrina!,"One of the best movies of my child hood memories... she seems evil, that catrina, but inside she was just misunderstood. great for kids! ""my little pony"" movies are classics! now understand it is not the same as ""my little pny tales"" yuck, thats way to uh, well, its just not the same."
2,On their deathbed.,"I really want 108 to cut a whole album that lives up to the first 30 seconds of Deathbed (track 2 onSongs of Separation) but they haven't ever been able to do it. Once again, I am mildly disappointed by an album I will listen to another 3 times and then forget is on my Ipod. The album title is great, though."
1,"The ""History"" of Yamaha Guitars is lacking...","I was hoping to find some - or any - information about Yamaha's lawsuit (or copy guitars). I have an LP copy called a Lord Player (similar to the Studio Lord) and there was NOTHING mentioned OR pictured about it. I see nothing for the Fender copies either. I appreciate the rest of the home-grown guitars, but that's a lot of missing history. There are some nice pictures of the other guitars, and a helpful serial number dating reference, but I'm disappointed with this book."
4,"Sweet, endearing love story","I had never heard of the book of Tobit until I read Angel Light, and then the very next week I attended a wedding where the story of Tobias and Sara was read in a wedding ceremony. I thoroughly enjoyed Angel Light, although Raphaella and her depictions of angel life were a little hard to swallow sometimes. Paddy was so lovable how could anyone not love him. As he becomes his own person, the reader wants to jump up and shout hooray. Sara makes you want to protect her one minute and slap her the next. But real people are that way. Greeley can spin a tale. This one leaves you feeling good."
2,Did not work for me,"I used this product following the manufacturer's instructions but unfortunately it managed to drain rather than maintain my battery. I did confirm that my lighter was still active even when the car was off so that was not the problem. In fact, I know something was happening because when I came down later that day (after I had plugged the battery maintainer into lighter of my car) the GPS screen on my car was open (it rotates up when the car turns on) and illuminated. I figured that it meant that the solar charger was working. Unfortunately, the next day when I went to start my car all it did was click. Somehow between the time I plugged in the battery maintainer and the next day something had drained my battery. I leave it up to you to decide what that was."
1,Does Not Last,"It worked well while it lasted, but the panel housing could not take the heat from direct sunlight. It's all warped and cracked now after about one week of use. For a product that's meant to be used in direct sunlight it should be made to take the heat. I guess you pay for what you get. Solar panels do work, but I would look for a more durable product."
3,OK construction - small current,"The construction seems solid enough, but be warned it's not intended to be mounted outside in the weather. Mount it on your dashboard under the windshield.The current produced is extremely small. You WILL NOT charge a battery in a day or 2 with this panel. It says ""Maintainer"", and that's what it is. It will only provide enough power to keep a battery from going bad. Just for fun, I hooked it up to a small electric motor and 4 wheels, and at high noon with no cloud cover it couldn't even move itself."
1,Flimsy,"The concept and packaging of this device is appealing. Unfortunately, after a minimal period of use, the wires broke off from the solar cell housing. (Easy to resolder, but I don't want to risk starting a fire in the car). Furthermore, the instructions tell you to always unplug the unit while the car is running, which is an annoyance and, I believe, hints at cheapo engineering. Avoid."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,MY FATHER HAS AN AN OLD TRANS-AM WE TOOK IT OUT ONCE A WEEK THE BATTERY WAS ALWAYS DISCHARGED. THIS SOLAR CHARGER SOLVED THIS PROBLEM!
4,Seal the solar panel with silicone.,"I bought 2 in the past and 2 new ones now, but one of them arrived not functioning. I got a quick replacement and put them in service keeping the batteries charged on a 41 ft. fishing boat. because they are outdoors i followed the printed directions to seal the glass with clear silicone and the power cord entry point. It seems to make the differance. my old one filled with rainwater and slowly died. these now pool water on top of the glass. Do it."
5,Just what I needed,"This works as advertised. I travel a great deal, so my car might sit for weeks at the airport without being driven. I did need to have an 'always hot' socket installed in my car since the one I had didn't work if the car wasn't on. A car audio seller was able to do that very cheaply. I never worry if my car will start now after being gone for several weeks."
2,Not meant for a Corolla,"I tried this panel to maintain the old battery in my corolla that I just ended up replacing due to its inadequate performance in the cold weather. I was hoping this panel would delay my having to do this, but after trying this device it seemed to not only not work, but it may have drained my battery. Plugging into the 12v socket was not an option for me because apparently Japanese cars don't send power to or from the battery when there is no key in the ignition. I had to use the alligator clamps and maybe the connection wasn't right, but it was difficult to connect it right unless the clamps were pointing straight up (getting in the way of the hood when closed). So I'm no authority on whether or not this panel will work for other cars (according to other reviews it does), but this product was not right for my car. Fortunately, Amazon authorized my return very quickly and I was able to easily track the prompt shipping updates."
1,Did not work to maintain car battery over the winter,"This product simply did not work. I plugged it into an ""always on"" auxiliary outlet in my Chrysler Town and Country. The car sat outside over the winter at my summer house with the panel exposed to the sun on the dash. The blue light was still on when I returned in April, and I checked that the panel was still producing electricity (tongue test, ouch!). However, the car battery was completely dead (no lights, nothing). I was able to start the car using jumper cables from another vehicle. After an hour of driving/charging, the battery held its charge and started the engine just fine."
3,"Half fascinating, half ridiculous","The first half of this book -- the one that stays withinhailing distance of reality -- is engrossing. Details of arsoninvestigation and a sympathetically flawed hero kept me glued to the pages, not wanting the book to end. The portrayal of arson investigator school are especially crisp.Somewhere in the middle of the book, though, it appears that Winslow freebased his James Ellroy collection. His prose starts hyperventilating, mimicking the Ellroy's staccato authority but throwing believability out the window.Winslow stokes his novel with complication and conspiracy until the engine explodes, with fatal results. He ends up with a grotesque charicature of Hollywood pulp and Ellroy complexity. Given the cool confidence he displays in the beginning, it's a real shame.Read the first half over and over again; read the second at your peril."
4,"fascinating, captivating",Almost but not quite five stars. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It was a very painless way to learn about arson and investigation of arson. The central character was beliveable and not a superhero. I would without hesitation recommend this book to anyone.
5,Rodney at his best,He was indeed the king of one liners. Rodney was quick whitted and was able to keep a string of jokes going for a long session. He could take the most ordinary daily things and twist them into a very funny reality. He was a truly funny guy. I have thoroughly enjoyed this CD. It does have some strong language and suggestive topics so be careful while listening with the kiddies.
3,Not for the religious,"I am looking for a religion to fulfil my needs as an individual. This book is to much logic and to little intuition. If you are looking for a lot of scientific babble, then this book is for you. In my opinion, it didn't help my journey at all."
3,Yoga video review,"Yoga videos are nothing like attending a real class, but for those who can't fit class times in with your busy schedules, these work. This video was more fast-paced than what i was used to. It really gives you a work out, although i was looking for something more spiritually based, i will keep it."
3,Gameshark for Gameboy Color,"Well... it's a bit low tech, but once you get the hang of using it, it becomes fairly simple. The cheats in it aren't so great, but you can do an internet search and find people who've made their own codes for this item/ GameBoy Color Games and input those yourself, which makes it slightly better.~Sorry, this is my first review, I know it's not very informative.~"
2,Time Consuming,"Unlike the Game Genie, which comes with a code book, the Gameshark does not come with a book. In order to find out what games the Gameshark is preloaded for, you have to load up the Gameboy with the Gameshark and a game. If the game you have is not listed then you have to log onto the internet and go to their web site for the codes."
4,POKEMANIA,"This is the best code enhancer ever! If you are a Pokemon fan you got to have this! It works on all the Pokemon games for Gameboy Color! I stank at Pokemon Silver and Gold, but then I got GameShark and no one can beat me now! you can get every Pokemon there is, plus Celebi! and you can make all of your Pokemon at level 100! This will make your friends so jealous! This is the best code enhancer ever! If your a Pokemon fan you MUST buy Gameshark! MUST!!!"
2,Gameshark is OK and NOT OK!,"I bought gameshark 4 years ago.I thought that if i had it i would get all the good secret stuff.It took me 2 hours to figure how to do it.The only way i could get the codes was from the internet.Mostly from www.gameshark.com. Everthing was going well until i noticed a glitch came in my game.I still kept using it.I used it and used it even if i had a glitch and then i got a new video game.I used gameshark on it and when i played it againn the game would work!!It just broke all thanks to gameshark.I also had another game that had another glitch and then when i tried to beat the game i could not beat it because of the glitch.From that time i never used it again.Gameshark's cheat technology isn't that stable and isn't ready for use yet.If you think of buying, it change your mind!!"
2,The gore reigns supreme,If blood and gore become the hallmarks of excellence then the movie industry has lost its ability to elevate our human emotions above our base instincts. Excusing grotesque behavior by clothing it with a personality disorder simply provides one more excuse to the human tragedy created by mass killing and senseless massacres of innocent people.
2,Another rental,"Quite an original story here, but the execution of it was very poor. Also, there are many times when the 'freaky' one was just too 'freaky', especially at school."
2,Somewhere between silly and stupid,"Sorry, I found the movie pointless and uninteresting, and I have a hard time understanding the rave reviews. I kept waiting for some revelation that never occurs, especially from the ending. I suppose I would characterize it as a black comedy, but it was at the low end of the spectrum. Rather than finding it interesting on some social, psychological, or religious level, it just felt dumb - like trying to be too cool for the room, and just not pulling it off. Frankly, the only thing that did impress me is how they made the lead actress, the lovely AnnaLynne McCord, so physically unattractive."
1,no plot,"there was no clear plot.It wasn't funny. It wasn't scarey. I was just gorse and weird.I normally like weird, but this was not enjoyable."
2,no tribute here,"looked forward to this album having been a fan of houndog's for years. Very dissapointed, no one creates the atmosphere thaty houndog created, he was one of a kind, maybe not the most talented but managed to produce a rawness that was second to none. he must be looking down and laughing at these so called artists and laughing. stick to the originals for the best."
5,Awesome!,"I've been considering making my own frame for quite awhile. I hate those hoops and the only other option was the bulky wood frames that are adjustable. Those have too much going on with the screws and bolts and they are heavy. Then I found this!! This frame is perfect! This frame is just pvc pipes that fit together in a square with bigger pvc pipes cut in half so they can clamp over the frame and hold the fabric. It's lightweight and it's expandable (by buying the extenders) so you can make the frame any size you need. The ""clamps"" cover the edges of the fabric completely so the fabric stays clean since your hands grip the clamps. Very easy to put together. Anyone with a little ambition (or a hubby) could probably make this themselves but the price isn't too bad."
2,nowhere near as good as 1080,"Compared to 1080 for nintendo this game is underproduced and annoying. Examples: It's impossible to shut off stupid remarks from the computer while the game is running; likewise, gameplay is lessened by thoughtless obsticles (sheep on a ski slope! ) and poor play dynamics (Bash through giant boulders that fall directly in your path -- )... This title feels like it was rushed to market -- it was tuned very poorly for its final release. Another personal gripe: It's impossible to turn off the lame music tracks. Lastly, having seen what the Dreamcast is capable of graphically, in games like Sonic and Soul Caliber, this game doesn't come close."
2,el cuerpo,"saw it when it was on tv. Fortunatly I taped and was able to ff ALOT of boring fill-in parts, but the story was fantastic so I purchased the dvd...very disappointed as so many of the important parts were cut and took away from the story. Buying it unedited will cost a fortune but at least you get to ff and still be able to see the whole wonderful story."
2,No Gould,"I have listened to Glenn Gould perform these variations with mastery for such a long time, I admit that a bias is there. Mr. Jarrett has done a wonderful job performing, but he has not elevated to Gould's level. Sorry to Keity Jarrett fans, but he's no Glenn Gould."
4,Both Better and Worse Than the Board Version,"Why is it better?The computer handles all the bookkeeping, movement, combat, etc, allowing you to play a whole game very quickly. You don't have to move the pieces manually or keep track of your money. Things move much faster.Why is it worse?The AI is very buggy and very poor. A decent human player can win as any nation against the best computer opponents. In a marathon session I won as each country in under two hours. A second problem is it's a bit tougher to get a good overview of the entire map without a lot of scrolling, so some areas may be overlooked easily.On the whole, if you enjoy the board game, this is worth a few dollars. You can get an A&A fix anytime you like, and the hotseat function allows 2-5 players play the game in about 1/3 the time of the board version."
1,blows,"This game is bad, bad, Bad, BAD!!!Do NOT waste your money!!So buggy, so ugly, and so easy to beat, it would be a ripoff even if it sold for 1 penny!!"
1,Hasbro is the worst!,"Many games like to win, but Hasbro is by far the worst! Yes, when you 1st load it you'll probably win, but Hasbro HATES to lose after that! Yes, they cheat big time! You'll end up deleting & reloading constantly just to get a fair game!"
5,"IT""S A MUST SEE!!!","I remember watching this movie one night as I was flipping through channels and for some reason I stopped to watch it. It was a sweet movie...that's when movies were REAL and not all the fake stuff that Hollywood portrays nowadays. I had to order the movie, couldn't find it anywere...Blockbuster did order it for me on VHS but, now I need to find this on DVD and haven't been able to find the same movie by Ivy Classics on DVD. I don't want to tell you too much about it, but it will touch your heart!"
4,"Great book for practical, everyday defense","Right from the beginning, this book explains in detail different moves for defense in real-life situations. The different methods are very clear cut with pictures to explain exactly what to do in that specific situation. These moves really work."
4,Nothing flashy,This is a fine book for picking up basic stick fighting techniques quickly. Clear sequence pictures demonstrate solid moves. No hanbo here; this is hitting the bad guy with a nightstick to discourage him or take him down. But isn't clear instruction what we're looking for?
2,Not so great,"I just bought this for my 3 year old and I have to say that compared to the other games, this one is not great at all. My daughter finds it too difficult and I think the games are boring. The Dora and Nemo games are far superior to this one and my daughter has played with those two games on and off for over a month. I'm glad I got this on sale because it didn't hold my daughters attention for even 5 minutes- I'm hoping that it will be more fun when she gets a little more coordinated but I don't think so."
3,Mask not as pictured,"The costume is okay. However, the mask looks nothing like the picture on the package. There are two small eye holes covered with mesh, and the mouth is just a little slit, not molded like the picture shows. My son was disappointed."
3,A Simple Start to Singing in Russian,"This is certainly a great guide to learning to sing in Russian. Especially helpful are the large Russian letters that enable one to clearly see each character of the Russian alphabet. The vowel sounds are not as thoroughly covered as the consonant sounds however, and this can prove troublesome for beginners. I would only recommend this book to someone who needs to review his/her Russian pronunciation."
3,Spiderman Comic book Leapster,"This is not for 6 year old boys that love to play outside.... My son was tickled to death to get a spiderman game, but this one was very disappointing for him. He was expecting a little more action, this is all about reading. It is too difficult for his reading level, he is in kindergarten and just putting together 3 letter words. This would be good for an older child at a more advanced reading level."
5,CANON NB-5L Equivalent Li Ion Battery,The battery came packaged well with no damange to it. It fit the charger and camera specified. It charged overnight and the 1300mAh rating kept the charge for several days of picture taking. A lower mAh ratng will not last as long.
1,Nothing of Value,"This book has absolutly nothing of value. A bunch fluff that boils down to:1) get a good job so that you are economically viable,2) become as physically attractractive as you can, via the gymor the clothing store.3) be honest.... Skip this title!!!"
3,A great attempt to bridge the gap,"... between men and women. An admirable task, and an enjoyable read. Runs through entertaining stereotypes taken from another book, made fun and discussed in detail. Unfortunately, a rash dictum on religion and morals towards the end tends to lessen the overall impact of the book. However, it still contains a decent basis for inspiring the genders to become better suited for each other."
3,bought for my wife,Got the product in a timely fashion. But my wife expected it to be brighter. Works well except for the brightness of light.
3,there is useful stuff in here,"I like the focus on liking yourself and living your life first, but felt the concession to America's obsession with thinness and youthfulness greatly diminished this. Suggesting that we may need a little surgery or a diet to appeal to more men almost made me stop reading the rest of the book. Luckily it was a fast read and I appreciated some of the insights from her own relationships and how men look at committment. The part on past patterns was good, but review for me-that's what I've been examining in my last year of non-dating.I'm going to ""chew the grass and spit out the sticks"" with this one. My positive attitude includes eating healthy, keeping fit but not obsessing about a number on a scale; practicing good skincare and hair care but no make-up. Since most people think I'm 30-something when I'm actually 47, it's good enough for me."
4,Give them a chance,"I have to admit, I hated them when I first saw them. I thought they were spoiled kids doing the teen angst thing and at 34, I wasn't in the mood for it. Then I saw them again in LV and met them and realized that they actually have some catchy songs, and incredible stage presence. No, this isn't an album that is going to change the world but the music is catchy, wiL's stage persona is fantastic (how the heck has he not knocked someone out with his mic yet?!?) and we all have to bear in mind that this is a bunch of kids that literally just finished high school."
1,Just when you thought My Chemical Romance Couldn't get anyworse..,"Their new album, Aiden Nightmare Anatomy is like a huge turd in the toilet that is scremo music. Some how the singer got even more off key, the drummer lost the beat even more, they found even lamer ways to wear ties, make up and girl pants!At least Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge had a good producer. this is sloppy as all hell! What were they thinking with this mess? The singer sounds like hes got cotton balls in his mouth at all times and doesn't have any sort of concept of what pitch is! I can't understand why 13 year old girls think these putzes are so cool.Oh wait... Aiden is the band name? this is a different band?! They have the never to think the sound anything like the misfits rather then a total MCR tribute band?! THATS EVEN WORSE!! Please don't support awful ""music"" like this."
4,Comprehensive Dictionary with One of Few Decent Overviews,"Probably the best of the Bantam New College series dictionaries, in my opinion. Its simple guide to French usage is simple enough to retain its clarity yet provide a good-enough overview so that one might compose small sentences with fair accuracy"
2,Get a different version,"I was excited to read and own this book. Then I read it. The English translation is horrible. Terrible sentence structure, and absolutely no command of the English language. The information is interesting, if you can get past the terrible sentence structures. I hate to write a bad review, I am usually a great audience for all artistic endeavors as I alway go, or read with excitement at the outset. Unfortunately, this is one book, I have to be honest, don't waste your money. Also, not for nothing, but the author obviously doesn't know what the word transliteration means, he apparently is in good company which is also extremely disappointing. More accurately it is a translation of the text.What the Torah Teaches us About SurvivalCompanion Workbook to What The Torah Teaches Us About SurvivalWhat The Torah Teaches Us About Spirituality/ Through Isaac's Own Spiritual Journey"
5,the best,"great blues from the texas bluesman himself,from the rockin jealous man to the great father like son there is know to the great acoustic roll of the dice,its a nice cd to add to your collection"
3,Could've been as great as the first...,"First off, let me say that I don't think THE AMITYVILLE HORROR should've gotten any sequels, because it was a very strong film on its own. But then, 1982 rolls around and someone suddenly gets an urge to ruin a good horror film by creating the unnecessary AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION. It's a prequel to the first one, chronicling the events that occured when the original family, the DeFeos owned the infamous Long Island home, which I have been to myself. I live in Bohemia, New York and Amityville is only about 20 minutes away.But, I digress. Instead of calling the family the DeFeos, they were called the Montellis. The movie starts off pretty good, actually, but then, eventually, everything goes downhill. It's not a good movie and I wouldn't buy it. It's worth a rent though."
1,Amityville The Possesion,"I think that this movie could have been alot better than it was. The original rocked, they should have stayed more with that line of thinking, or not done it at all."
4,The best in the series!!!,"The first time I saw this film, I was alone and in the dark ( The only way this film should be viewed) and it scared the crap out of me!!! I am a big horror fan and it's not often I say this but Ammityville II: The Possession delivers the goods!!!"
1,So bad it's even less than funny,"As the mediocre Tibetan philosopher Runkdalunkhedloozer was once overheard screaming from the restroom: ""Now that's a piece of crap!""There are no redeeming qualities to this film, even if you are great at finding ways to laugh at poorly made movies (which is not an admirable trait, as it's a defense mechanism which allows us to not regret spending money on what we thought would be a good movie).Bad acting, bad acting, and more bad acting, the biggest offender being the mother. Paulie from the Rocky movies phones in his performance (when he was even in the flick, that is). The possessed guy is annoying but at least seems to take his character seriously. The sister he gets it in with is pretty hot, but she gets more naked ""The Last American Virgin""."
1,"Lacking The Firsts Campy Acting, This Is Just Awful","With little or no campy acting to hang your attention on or even a great score like the first, this movie becomes just a boring almost coma inducing attempt at horror. Really the PITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Amityville revisited,"Prequel to the original film is loosely (and I mean loosely) based on the ill fated DeFeo family that were murdered in their sleep by their son Ronald. Named Sonny here, the young man is obviously possessed, much to the consternation of the local priest. The family is troubled to begin with (physical and emotional abuse, incest, and so on) and before long Sonny snaps and murders his family with a shotgun. Still with me? Okay. The rest of the film details how the priest tries to release Sonny from his demonic possession. The second half shamelessly rips off ""The Exorcist"", most likely to pad the running time after the murders. Passable entertainment, and after this all the other sequels go downhill."
1,Proliance top of line radiator - NOT,"Installed in truck and in 6 months the tank on one side is leaking. Could have saved $120 by buying one with plastic tanks.......wish I had now, at least I would have expected this kind of problem."
3,Stretching the truth a lot but enjoyable,"Jim Thompson was a one of a kind writer who could write the absolute worst chapters one could dream of followed by tremendous passages of work. He was that uneven as a writer.In Roughneck, we get an autobiographical look at a period in his lfe where he is looking for money and improvement as a writer while travelling across the USA of the 1930's to 1950's.There are a lot of tall tales in this book and one needs to take that into account but all in all, I think this book is worth a read, just don't expect too much truth."
1,Read between the lines,My daughter received this game based on toys r us age recomendation 5-8. Well click on the picture of the item and the age is 2nd to 3rd grade how many 5 year olds that you know that can really do 2nd grade math. I contaced toys r us via email and they apologized and did nothing to change the age. Let the buyer beware.
1,this pack is not exceptable,"This pack was not at all what I wanted. Although it has a battery pack there is hardly any space for games and the fanny pack itself is pretty ugly. My kids felt embarressed to walk around with it, as they are very into fashion and the fanny pack was not at all fashionable. As a warning: If you have 12+ year old kids do not get this for them, they'll hate you."
3,Not wonderful,"The pictures in this book are great. What I dislike, is that since they are at a wide angle, the pictures generally take up a page and a half. I feel like you are missing something when the middle of the picture is in the spine of the book."
5,Spectacular Photos,"National Geographic has, of course, always been noted for outstanding photography. The book Wide Angle is certainly no exception. It offers 260 great photos covering every corner of the Earth. The book is divided by regions so the photos are grouped appropriately. Credit is given to the photographers, and the dates and places for the pictures are clearly indicated. This is an excellent book to go through slowly while perusing the photos at length. The skill and the vision of the photographers is evident throughout.The book is a companion volume to two other National Geographic books - Through the Lens and In Focus. All the books are excellent."
4,"Nice graphics, but...","Great graphics! Games are interesting. However, it won't make me give up my high-end PC!"
5,I hate football and loved this game.,"I hate football. I saw this game over at a friend's place, and thought ""whee, they're playing a football game."" Then I *saw* it. The graphics are amazing, it's hard to tell the difference between it and watching football on TV during the replays, especially if there is fog. The ability to select plays is rather impressive, and actually made me interested in the tactics of football, something I never have been before. For anyone who likes football, this is a must-have, and is even enjoyable for those of us who don't."
5,Boo-Yah,Absolutely unbelievable. Incredible. I can't think of the adjectives to describe it. If you're considering it...Stop considering. Buy It.
3,Get NFL 2K1,"Get NFL 2K1 and sign up for SegaNet. If you feel NFL 2K was orgasmic, NFL2K1 will BLOW you away."
4,Simply Outstanding!,"One review or rating really doesn't give this collection of works any justice. This is an absolute outstanding effort by these churches to produce a high-quality and highly inspirational product. They did just that! I enjoyed every selection on the CD. Our male chorus director was so impressed by the #6 selection "" He's Just That Kind of God"", he purchased sheet music and we learned and performed the song for our annual program. In fact, we used it as our theme. Don't stop there though, I truly believe that you we be lifted by the entire album. Enjoy!! God Bless"
1,no tea for me please!,"what can i say about this movie......it was the most pointless zeffirelli outing i have ever seen. when i was a teenager, i thought zeffirelli's romeo and juliet was bad! after seeing tea with mussolini, one can see why movies such as life is beautiful or even schindler's list are more popular. what i say is simple...if you want to watch this movie on a rainy weekend, don't! SIT BACK AND ENJOY A JAMES BOND MOVIE! you can buy them right here on amazon.com and they ARE great!"
1,A cross between...,"...""Enchanted April"" and ""Life is Beautiful""? You must be joking. Those two movies were far superior to this one."
4,Tea With Mussolini,I had rented this movie years ago and knew I would want to add it to my movie collection at some point. I am a huge Judy Dench fan and was on a search of movies she has done. Seeing TWM on the list jogged my memory so I ordered it. I watched it again as soon as it came and I wasn't disappointed or wrong in my memory. A great movie!
3,Dissatisfied customer,"This DVD (Tea with Mussolini)was a copy of an original. This was NOT a used original. There was not a mark, word, color etc on this disk. grrrrrr."
4,"Touching and Uplifting, whether true or not.....","This film is very touching, even though the story is not a true one. It is also humorous in a special ""Italian/Spanish cinema"" kind of way.The ensemble of the ladies is quite charming: they all very different, but the war gave them common goal to fight for... and so they fight. Judy Dench seems to be most memorable lady: she is the eccentric artist, who in love with Italian art. Cher's character is also interesting.Inspiring and uplifting... Coming from Franco Zeffirelli, it just could not be bad, in my view."
5,Classy movie watcher,"Although this movie is not very familiar to many people, it is a gem. It stars Cher, Maggie Smith, Dame Judy Dench, Joan Plowright, and Lili Tomlin. It is a semi-biographical story of the director of the film, Franco Zeffirelli and takes place in Italy at the start of WWII. This movie is in the same class as Enchanted April or any of the Merchant Ivory movies. Well worth the time."
4,Excalibur reforged,"With X-Treme X-Men ending, legendary scribe Chris Claremont returned with a new Excalibur series, focusing on Professor Xavier and his trip to the ruins of Genosha with the body of Magneto. He encounters a small cadre of surviving mutants, and we the readers discover that Magneto is not dead (of course) and that it was an imposter masquerading as Magneto in Grant Morrison's classic Planet X book. Those who were wowed with Morrison's turn of events may have a hard time overlooking that (you didn't really think Magneto was dead did you?), but if you can look past it, you'll find some great classic Claremont storytelling and the scenes between Xavier and Magneto are great comic moments. The art is solid (I can't remember the guy's name, Aaron something) and worth the price of admission. All in all, longtime X-fans will want to pick this up, and if you missed out on this give it a look."
3,Normally I like books like this but in this case....,"I just hate it when I get four pages into a ""science"" book and find a major, easy to ""Fact check"" error. The author asserts that Guam is fifteen hundred miles west of Honolulu. Actually it's 3,800 miles. He then tells us, page 71, that the submerged ""new island"" of Loihi is one mile from the Big Island of Hawaii. Actually its more than 20 miles from the coast.While the story of the brown tree snake on Guam is an important one, it is much better told in Mark Jaffe's book ""And No Birds Sing"" (1994) and Jaffe's book has an Index. This one doesn't.The last 80% of this book is about other ""ecological invasions"" that are interesting and not so familiar to me. The writing is pleasant, though chatty. But I wish I didn't feel I should wonder about the accuracy of the facts.Shame on the Publisher, FSG."
4,It did realy oppen my eyes to the subject of invasive species and its consecuences,"Out of Eden is an interesting essay on invasive species, how ecology of invasive species works, how it was and is being studied and in general what are the larger consequences of an increasing globalization of fauna and flora. Invasive species and globalization of fauna and flora is considered the second biggest challenge to biodiversity after loss of habitat something many conservationists and nature lovers tend to forget. It is easy to read not only because it is well written but also because instead of theorizing on the matter it takes the reader through a series of very concrete example of invasions possibly caussing loss of diversity or even economic losses in the invaded habitats and from those examples extracts the necessary lessons and conclusions. Being a amateur biologist this book has been a real eye oppener for me on the subject of invasive species."
2,Disappionting,I was very disappointed in this PC game. It was boring. Everything about the game was chance. You have little control over what happens. Game time is short and it is very likely you did not win anyway. It was a waste of my time. If you really think you need this game - buy it used or at least a new one cheap.
3,An ok to good game.,This game is a little on the boring side.The graphics are good.A nice twist on the board game.The AI is a bit dumb.
3,"Interesting, and a great price","What a strange three volume set. All you ever wanted to know about Nazi ideology in three hour long episodes. The documentary is reasonably non-judgemental (although the fact that they gassed 6 million jews is not glossed over), rather it is a look back in history to try and find reasons for the Hitler's ""different"" perspective on Germans, Jews and the whole of world history. There is a large amount of documentary footage which I hadn't seen before, and I've seen a fair amount of footage from the inter war years.And even if you you hate the thing, ...Can't argue about the price, at least."
4,The best basketball game ever! No contest!,"If you love the NBA, you absolutely must purchase this game. It's one of the absolute must haves for any sports fan and dreamcast owner. My friends and I can't get enough of that NBA action. It is extremely realistic right down to the pick and roll. Definitely a must have. I'm a Jazz Man myself and Karl Malone dunks like him, moves like him, and most accurately looks like him. The same goes for Stockton who can shoot but can't dunk. Just like it is, man."
4,Not what I wanted,"I have a 512 U3 smart drive and I like it so much I wanted to upgrade to a 2GB however this one (as ordered from Amazon) do not have the U3 technology. It works fine, but I was hoping for the U3 stuff.Overall good product however!"
1,A Swing and a Miss,"This book adds nothing to the wonderful work of imaginative, psychokinetic lyrics backed by the saddest, sweetest horns ever played by white people. It appears to be a third or fourth hand recount of someone's late night recollection of a band that probably involved Jeff Magnum. Most of the interesting details are from the Avery Island sessions. I was ready to have my mind blown, but this book quietly (silently) reminded me that there is no way to explain what the Neutral Milk Hotel accomplished with In the Aeorplane Over the Sea. At least not this time around."
2,A book about the 90's,"I bought this book for answers to questions I have about the lyrics to this album, not for answers to questions I have about the 90's or about living in a commune."
5,kids like it,"compared to the old nova series that i love, kids like this imax version of history better, due to the filming style in short snips and very colourful."
2,False advertising,"The sticker on the CD case in the store compared this band to System of a Down, Tool, and Mars Volta. Did someone at the record company mislabel this? This sounds more like Cannibal Corpse to me. This band appears to have some serious musical abilities but the ""music"" seems out of place right next to unintelligable thrashing and grunting fits. If you are into mathcore/noisecore with interesting musical dynamics might I suggest the latest Dillinger Escape Plan album - Miss Machine."
1,Worthless for Mountain Bikes,"Agree with the other reviewer who noted that- despite claiming to fit all size tires- this product does not work with mountain bikes.Also, the screws are cheap, so when I tried to remove it from my wall I ended up having to drill the heads off of the screws.Maybe this works great for road bikes. But Delta's advertising claims are crap, and I doubt Ill buy anything made by them again since I won't know if it will work as advertised or not."
3,Almost a good product,"Looks to be strong enough, but it does not come with any hardware. Surprisingly enough since the box they sent it in would have held 50 bike racks."
2,couldn't use it...yet,"I bought these hoping to hang my bike in my apartment and save some space, since my housemate and I both store our bikes inside. Theoretically, they looked like they were going to work great. Unfortunately, I can't get them to hold up in sheetrock, even with wall anchors, and there wasn't a spot that I could get them into a support beam. (Living in an apartment, I have no garage either). Hopefully I'll get a chance to try them back home at my parents house, or when I move into a new place."
4,Sleek,"This is a pretty design and seems to be working well with our bikes. It would be nice to have the bumper for the back wheel included (we have marks on the wall where it hits). Also, there is absolutely no way to hang this without having a stud so made sure that wherever you plan to hang your bike there is a stud. We had plans of a sleek close line of bikes utilizing hefty wall anchors, but that didn't work out."
4,"brilliant design, easy installation","2nd one I've bought. These are priced right, easy to install, and pretty sharp looking. My wife and I have Sun cruiser bikes with pretty wide tires--the tires fit tightly, but fit. The one complaint I have is that in some of the marketing I've seen, there is the implication that a second ""shelf"" piece, for the bottom wheel, is included. It's not."
3,Could have been magical but isn't.....,"I am a big fan of Dr. Strange. It is wonderful to see the mystical and magical brought into this format. My one complaint is the sad small minded treatment of other world views in these 1970's reprints. For instance, by the time you finish the second story you find that one of the villans is called ""The Living Buddha"" with a mock drawing to go along. Could you imagine a comic with ""The Living Christ"" as a villan? Then there is a picture of evil taking over in the world. You see a Christian church in flames while a pagan symbol rises as a sign of evil. It would have nice to see this team learn a little of other world views before bashing them. The world has enough of this misunderstanding."
5,Can't Get Enough Historical Mysteries!,"To me historical mysteries are so much more pleasant than contemporary ones. Perhaps it is because the historical ones are not in the least threatening. This book of short mysteries is not only very pleasant to read, but it gave me a list of new authors to look up in the library."
2,Plain,"This is a pocket sized - well presented book. it contains many pictures, but when I had read it through, and browsed it a couple of times, I realized the images were nondescriptive and anonymous. I realized that I already knew 95% of the stuff - The book presents the basic stereotypical italian food (pretty well) - Pizza, and Pasta are highlighted, unfortunately I believe these dishes are over-represented when speaking about italian cuisine. The thing I thought I'd find most helpful was the dictionary on culinary terms in the end of the book. But at the restaurants I visited, I still managed to communicate sufficiently in english to understand what the food contained and what I'd like to order, still I was aided a couple of times by being able to look up a word. If you are completely unaware about italian cooking and will be visiting italy - then you may find the book helpful and informative."
4,Food experience,"I brought this book as a tool to help plan a trip to Italy. It helped to understand different variety of food and some food that was not familiar to us. Once in Italy, we try things we would not have known about if we did not read this book."
4,Very good product,"It works as it should and I would buy the same one again. the only improvements I would make would be a longer hose, and some type of grip on the nozzle. When my hands are soapy I really have to grip the nozzle as it is somewhat heavy to keep it from slipping around."
5,Excellent Shower Massage,"I recently purchased this item while the hose has an odor it is going away. I replaced my old waterpik shower head with this one. It works fantastic and I would recommend that you buy it. It has alot of force with the spray. I did remove the water saver as I have a well and water pressure isn't that great. Buy this product, you will not regret it."
4,Gives Puke Cravings,"This game is one of those you buy for 4.99 at K-MART, UNFORTUNATELY IT WOULD STILL BE BAD. I hated the game though it has a good plot. I got it for Christmas, that day I woke up at nine in the morning. I played the game at ten and by 10:45 AM I beat the game. Short game, pointless to buy. Wait till it hits the stands for 4.99 then buy it."
2,It's fun...for about five minutes,"Arcade conversions usually aren't the best games out there, mainly because arcade games play by different rules. They're meant to be easy to pick up and able to hold onto your attention for a little while. But when they're brought to home consoles, they get old fast. And Dynamite Cop gets old very fast. You punch the bad guys with a variety of weapons for about fifteen minutes, then the game ends. That's it. Not too impressive."
3,Slip on loafer.,I bought these shoes because I like a previous pair of Merrell shoes. The slip on loafer is not as comfortable and I need an arch support insert to keep my back from hurting. I work in an O.R. and stand on tile floor most of my shift. My last pair of Merrell's didn't require inserts. The size runs a little large but I'm okay with extra toe room. Once these wear out I will not buy the same shoe as a replacement. I like the BOC slip on loafer better for work shoe.
3,Agree with another review - comfortable but not durable!,I work in an office setting so I actually don't walk very much in these shoes but I wear them about 4 times a week. They are very comfortable and don't set off security alarms when walking through (a huge plus for me) but within a few months I began to feel ashamed to wear them because they started to look scraggly. Also the sole is coming loose from the shoe and I've even wondered about buying some glue. For the money I'm disapointed in the wear. IF more quality were put into these I'd buy them over and over. I will say that I own several Merrell and love them all. It's hard for me to find shoes I can wear all day from the moment they come out of the box without breaking them in in some way but so far I'm able to do that with Merrill! I do buy a 1/2 size larger than normal though because for me they are made small. Just wish they held up better. I own several from Merrell and love feel of all of them.
1,Not worth the money,Tennis balls do the exact same thing as the ball that comes in the kit. Dont waste your $$$$!!! I ended up returning mine and using tennis balls and buying a $30.00 roller from the chiropractor.
3,"Great products, but set unneccessary","I really like the larger roller and the ball, but really the whole set is unneccessary and more expensive than what its worth. If I had the chance again, I would buy the large roller only, and use a tennis ball instead of the ball in this set. There is nothing different from this ball to a tennis ball for rolling on your foot or back, and there is no purpose that the smaller roller or block serve. The large roller would be adequate for anything that you need, even calfs, which is what the smaller roller is designed for. Just buy the big roller and save yourself some money!I will say though, the large roller has been very helpful in aleviating my pain and helping my muscles to recover, so I would give that product 5 stars for sure, and will recommend that to EVERYONE!"
3,Sliding feature unavailable with cover on...,"If you're one who will be using the sliding feature of your phone, the cover will be useless. Your phone fits snug into the cover, like it should, but will have to be taken out to slide open. Also the plastic screen cover only covers the top half of your screen. I think this is more of a ""one size fits all phone types"" cover, but not for a sliding phone. The other items included are worth the low price alone, but you can find elsewhere on Amazon even cheaper. The D807 is still so new, there are newer accessories coming out every week...so keep checking.Update:Nov.2, 2006...if you are looking for the perfect cover for your D807 (so far), I've found it. Punch in Neoprene Cellular Phone Cover or click on my ""other reviews""."
3,Clever idea but makes too much noise,This is a clever product especially if you don't want to buy a full swing and you don't have a lot of space in your home. It is very easy to put together and is compact enough to put it away in a closet or in a corner of a room. The one thing that is irritating is the machine makes a loud ticking noise. The price is just right if you are on a budget. The Graco Snugride 35 fit just right on the swing. Our baby did sleep through the entire time we had him in it so it's worth the purchase.
4,Depends on the baby,"We got this before my son was born. He hated his car seat so this didn't get much use. We tried to sell it at a yard sale with no luck, so down to the basement it went.Then our daughter was born. She loves her car seat, and loves this product as well.I would have given it 5 stars, but the clicking noise is loud (again daughter loves it as it's a white noise to her). Also, the speed setting is very hard to get ""just right""."
3,great concept,"This is great in concept and seemed to work fine...we have a small home and were looking to use space efficiently. However, we did not get a chance to really test it out since it turned out our baby HATED the carseat!"
4,great compact swing,"This is a great compact swing and was easy to assemble. I didn't realize it also had a vibrating feature, which was a nice surprise and I often use it without the swinging feature. It seems like the vibrate barely makes it through the structure of the carseat so I always have it on high. It requires two sets of batteries, both As and Cs, which was a bit of a pain. But otherwise it's just what we needed."
4,Great swing but devours batteries,"I love this swing! It puts my son to sleep and keeps him asleep. It takes up little room in our tiny house. The things I don't like are that it doesn't have a plug in option because we go through C batteries fast, the music and vibration controls are hard to get to, and it really only swings a heavy baby on the highest setting. I think its worth the money especially if you have limited space."
2,Not well made,"This unit is very poor quality. Does not mount flush on the floor, cup holders are to shallow to hold drinks. No security; can be easily opened without a key by pushing the console top sideways. Poor fit. Vinyl install is wrinkled. I returned it."
