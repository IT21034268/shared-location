5,The Addams Family/Addams Family Values DVD,"Awesome movies, forgot how good there where. I have watched over and over again. Received the DVD within a matter of days of placing my order. I would recommend this buyer"
3,ADDAMS AND ALL,WE'VE BEEN FANS OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY SINCE THE SERIES WAS ON TV YEARS AGO. THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE SCARY FOR SMALLER CHILDREN BUT OLDER ONES WILL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE ANTICS OF THIS STRANGE BUT LOVABLE FAMILY.
3,Doesn't Hold Child's Interest,"We received this toy as a Christmas gift for our 16 month-old daughter. The toy was interesting to our daughter for the first two days, but now she simply ignores it. There is just not enough going for this toy to hold a child's interest after a few days. You press Elmo's hand, the music starts, Elmo dances, and that's about all there is to it. The limbo stick that comes with this toy is completely useless (the child is supposed to just hold it over Elmo while he dances). Like another reviewer mentioned, this toy does not work well on carpet. Actually, it tips over pretty easily on hardwood flooring as well. I am glad that we did not purchase this toy ourselves, as I would feel that our money was wasted."
2,WATCH OUT FOR THE LIMBO STICK!!!,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday. The next day she was playing with the limbo stick...each end pulls out from it. When she shut the stick, it shut quickly and pinched her leg in it. I really had to work to get it open to free her leg. She has a good size spot and bruise. The doll is fine but, the stick is a hazard."
4,Very Cute Toy!,My son is one and does like this toy. There isn't much that he can do with this toy so he just watches it. The first one we had he went over and picked it up and it broke. He did not even do much to the toy he just picked it up to look at it. But now we have a new one and we have not had any trouble yet.
5,"A can't put down, must read","Eric J. Dickey stepped on the scene, and has made quite a name for himself. His first entry into the world of literature is funny, concise, and thoroughly entertaining. Dickey writes about issues everyone can relate to - lost loves, jilted lovers, and sadistic acts of revenge (or at least the thoughts of).This book is easy to read with everyday dialogue. The story enthralls you with the first chapter and you are compelled to read until you get to the last page. Trust me, I stayed up until 2 in the morning just to finish this one.If you don't have it, add it to your collection."
3,Not So Good,"I did not like this book! I'm suprised that alot of people enjoyed it. I am so mad that I bought it. There were so many times that I wanted to put it down and scream. The scenarios were good,but I don't think any woman talks like Inda. the slang the writer used was really weird. Maybe its because I'm from new york. But I don't think any man's game is that tight to fool 3 women."
4,Good Stuff!,The characters are wild and confused but got it together somewhat in the end. The characters blended in well together. The book did have surprise twist and the ending was great.
5,OFF THE HOOK!,"MY BROTHER! THIS BOOK WAS OFF THE HOOK! I WASN'T TRYING TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! YOU HAD ME TALKING TO MYSELF ON THE BUS LIKE ''GIRL I KNOW YOU DIDN'T!'' MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT TO YOU! GOD BLESS, QUEEN"
5,Biography + History,"""The Right Hand of Power"" (great title) is an excellent biography & analysis of a diplomat's life & work.Covers a lot of years with a candid description of many of the leader's of American policy, prior toWWII & through the next 30 years.Bought inexpensively @ Amazon.coom"
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"Not up to Ms. Robards usual quality. I found the characters superficial and the descriptions of the serial killers antics not really frightening. And there was no real connection or explanation as to how he got away with his murders for so long.Sorry to write such a downer when everyone else's comment were so glowing, but there just wasn't enough depth to the characters to make me really care about them."
2,don't bother,"Why did the author feel this book needed to have the child murderer/taxidermist sick storyline? It would have been a good romance without it, enough conflict and people to have supported plenty of interesting story. I felt resentful everytime the author switched to one of the stalking scenes and that it was unnecessarily brutal to include them. Does she feel the only way to sell books is to capitalize on sick titillation? Bleh."
2,Robards can do better than this...,"Disappointing, formulaic novel. A few chilling scenes do not save this uninspired novel. Nothing new except for some insensitive nepotism on the part of one of the main characters - I'd quit if I worked for him."
4,"Excellent, thoughtful book","If you want a thorough exposition on all of the issues you will need to consider when thinking about Egptian Gods, or God in general, this is an excellent work. Honing is admirable in discussing and critiquing many perspectives, and the last sections of summary are worth it alone. However I sense at times he is a bit sneaky in how he presents evidence so as to favor his views. For example, he excludes pantheism, and never links ntr and nature, both of which are strongly implied by the characteristics of the Egyptin Gods and Goddesses. Nonetheless the points he does make are strong and refreshingly critical- it is clear he has thought more extensively than average."
1,they used to be good,"I've been a fan of Acoustic Alchemy for some time now. And I fully realize that bands need to change and evolve. However, this is most definitely a lame segue of the duo into a JazzLite phase that minimizes the impact of their ability. What sound precisely were they going for? This album makes for pleasant, non-offensive background music at best (well, except for some truly cloying and annoying vocalizations) but certainly does not merit acknowledgement as an audio treat. Sorry."
3,Avery 12' fast break ground hunting blind,"I bought the Avery hunting blind to use for turkey hunting. It was very easy to set up. A little bit flimsy once set up, but did its job. Breaks down so you store it in a backpack in and out of the woods."
2,Record button sticks,"This was purchased for medical dictation, but the record button is apparently hard to engage so half of what she dictates is missing."
3,"Good for voice note, not that good for music practice","So-so for me.I would have given it 5 stars if I use it only for voice note. It does what it is supposed to, and it does it well.However, it didn't work well for my daughter's violin lesson. The idea was she records herself and/or her teacher, and later she plays along with the recorded thing for practice.The problem is, the recorded notes sound always a bit higher than originally played on the instrument. I guess the tape speed is faster when playing back than when recording, for some reason. Maybe you wouldn't notice at first, but as soon as you try to play along with the tape it becomes apparent.Probably I was hoping too much for an inexpensive microcasette recorder, though. I wouldn't blame the manufacturer."
1,olympus S711blue Microcassette Voice Recorder,"Well, first off I purchased this recorder with Pepsi points. I waited for this to arrive for at least three months! and when it did, well all I can say is JUNK- when using it, voices come out sounding like chipmunks on crack!I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone..."
1,Bad Manufacturer,"After purchasing this item and using it two times it stopped working. The ad never said this was a discontinued item and when I contacted the manufacturer (Olympus)they told me they would not replace a brand new item but would look at it and if possible repair it. The warranty stated repair or replacement. Since I had only used it for 3 hours and it died during that period, I will never purchase another Olympus product. In addition, the seller had changed their name (as I was told by Amazom) and was now selling the exact same product for twice what I paid for it. Although Amazon is wonderful to deal with and they bent over backwards to accommodate me, I will never buy another item from this seller or from the manufacturer. I will continue to use Amazon because they are wonderful."
5,INSPIRING,Having these cards tucked away in my desk drawer at work is a real help when things get challenging at work. A must have for inspiration.
3,Holding out for Hero-Hebrews,Some good information on Hebrews but not quite the depth I was looking for in a study. But several in our study group liked overall study.
5,Great Game!,"I purchased this game some time ago. We would use a large white board and had the multi-pack of colored dry erase pens (fat bold ones).The entire family would play it when we were together on holidays. We didn't have teams - it was ""open season"" - whoever guessed what it was, became the next person to draw. Talk about some competition! lolololIt was lots of fun for everyone involved, from the young to the old and those in-between. I think it's time to get another one!"
1,Do not bother,"The sound quality is so poor that I must admit I did not get through the whole CD. Excruciating! I am a Horowitz fan and can recommend other recordings (eg. Complete recordings on Deutsche Grammophon, set of 6 CDs). You can give this one a miss and you will not even notice."
1,Boring personified,"I had to read a canadian lit book, so i picked this up cause it was short. Two words...BIG MISTAKE! I would rather have read a 300 pg Margret Atwood book over this extremely boring, slow, confusing assemblement of incoherant words. If boring was an object, this book would be it. I would have given this a half star if i could have."
2,Too Many Extras........Not enough Episodes,"I love the show and have enjoyed watching it. However this page does not list how many episodes are on each series, there are only 6 in each. Although I probably should have investigated them individually I was really exited about the prospect of getting 2 full seasons (atleast from an American viewpoint) and when they arrived they were packaged together with the fronts facing out opposite each other, needless to say once I got the package opened and scanned the backs I realized I only had 12 episodes total on two discs, the other two are full of extras. At discovering this I wanted to return them but could not because I had to open the package to find out that there were only 6 episodes to a series. I have since discovered that they sell a copy of Just the Episodes that have Series 1,2,3,and 4, which I would have bought had I seen it before I had purchased this product."
4,Nice set to start your toddler on the right foot to safety,"I bought this helmet set for my daughter before she was 2. We used the foam strips (included) to adjust the helmet and make sure that she had a good fit. She's 3 now and she still wears the helmet. The only thing is, the sunglasses were too small for her even before she was 2."
4,Repair PB plumbing,PB piping is no longer used so making repairs with standard fittings doen't work. These fittings worked perfectly and vendor delivered as promised.
5,Excellent,Both of our dogs love this food. The pieces are small enough for our American Eskimo to enjoy and our Black Lab doesn't care what size the pieces are.
2,Definately doesn't deserve 5 stars,"I thought this would be more raw and hardcore, but I was disappointed. Being that RZA is in it I figured it'd be somewhat like Wu, with the style, but it definately sounded nothin like them. It had some alright flows and OK beats, but a lot of it just seemed cheezy to me. I just wasn't feelin it. You can tell a couple members had potential, but it just didn't come together right on this. It seems like they're off beat a lot too. If you're lookin for that raw new york sound, stick to wu-tang or nas... definately not this."
5,Herbatint hair color,I have used this product for over twenty years. The color adheres nicely to the hair andnever fades through washings. I recommend it greatly for anyone being it is a 'natural' productfor everyone especially with medical problems.
4,A good book for parents and teachers who just don't know where to begin.,Length:: 0:35 MinsFisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks
5,Escaping Family,"The Island ,by Isabelle Holland, is a very good story about a seventeen yearold girl. this book deals with a lot of things ,including prejuduice, which comes out later in the book. I felt that it was well written and though sometimes itjumped, it progressed smoothly. i think that the plot was really well developed and full of twists and turns.Over all the book was really good. I reccomend it to any one who likes a romantic mystery / adventure novel."
5,This is the best CD you will get for a long time,"The Medival Bbes are the only group I get trully excited talking about, and this album is the 1st one from them to trully transcend the typical and mundane associations with the term Medival, which they started with the album Undrentide, employing more adventurous arangements and more input from the other Bbes. There are two songs on this album which are indescribable in their ability to be beautiful to the point of heart-wrenching; Temptasyon and Lhiannan Shee. Rarely have I been literally moved to tears by music, especially in this day and age. I can only imagine the angels of heaven being more moving.Their rendition of Scarborough Fayre makes you forget all about those two old hippies.Get this CD!!"
2,Not what I expected from Barbie,"I like the doll, and the baby but the crib is the poorest design from Barbie. My daughter went to play with it and the hinges don't stay on or the mobile. This just upset my daughter and she only ended up playing with it for a few minutes. I was really unhappy with the quality of this product."
4,This is Pretty Cool!,"My friend has this barbie and i played with it for a short time but the Krissy doll needs to be dressed by older people, (like a older brother, sister, etc..) I loved the pants! They are so sporty unlike the stupid dresses that barbie sometimes has. I saw the barbie a couple days ago and her hair was falling out of the rubberbands that she came in and i really like that bsrbie and wanted to play with her but I didn't because of that. I guess that is just wear and tear so that isn't probably a big problem. The crib I didn't really play with but I remember this hole in Krissy's back and a stick thing in the crib to make her stay in. I don't like this because if you lose the Krissy and get another one, she can't fit in the crib. Otherwise, this is a pretty cool toy!"
4,Magical,Evrethyng related to the barbie dolls it's very important to mebecause i'm a big fan and collector and this is one of the most wonderfull pieces of art (literaly) that i've have ever found.
4,Natural deodorant,"I wanted to get rid of deodorants after reading about the hazards of the ingredients used in them. These crystals do the job. No they do not keep you from sweating. But, they do take care of the odor. Use as directed... after showering and such. I have not bought deodorant in years. These rocks last a long, long time..."
2,Works ok for short periods.,Crystal spray would need to be re-sprayed every 1-2 hours to prevent underarm odor (& I'm not so sure this would even work). The Thai brand Liquid Crystal Spray deodorant works much much better for me.
4,it works,"The air admittance valve works, is easy to install, and corrected my drain issues. This is the second one I ve purchased and I have been satisfied with the entire process each time."
3,Lush Panorama,"Actually, I give 3 1/2 Stars to this subtitled Polish film. It provides a lushly filmed panoramic view of the outbreak of World war II and its effects on a number of civilian and military personnel in Poland and in captivity elsewhere. Very strong on Polish nationalism, Catholicism, and the evils of Soviet communism . My sense is that the movie is about a half hour too long. The second half is quite tedious in comparison to the more lively first half, and this detracts from the overall viewing experience."
5,Victim,"This movie is good and sad. Soviet Red Army murdered more than 20,000 Polish Catholic officers. Soviet blamed Germany did it. It was not Germany Nazi. Do not trust Soviet Russia."
5,3.4L GM Drive Belt,"First let me say that finding out Amazon ships most (all that I've searched for) ACDelco parts for free is really great. I'm a GM junkie, and there's a certain satisfaction installing the same stuff that the dealer would on your car.As far as the belt, it fit my 2000 Silhouette great, doesn't squeak, and runs all my accessory pulleys. What more could you ask for? ACDelco quality is second to none. Very happy with this belt."
2,Boring,"Unengaged and unengaging, this is one of the dullest releases I've given an ear in quite some time. Truly muzak for the pipes and whistle crowd."
4,Celtic Trance delivers...,"If you're not looking for ""Traditional"" Irish jigs, reels, lyrics, ballads or tunes, but rather a tightly put together selection of songs with a modern, mystic, Celtic ""flavor"" and a dream-like quality, with a nice heavy bass beat...then this is a CD for you!Some reviewers here have mentioned the similar sound of each song and have seen that as a 'negative'. Frankly, with the word ""trance"" in the title, that's a tip off (to me at least) that the whole CD is *meant* to flow seamlessly from one song into the next, with no jarring stops and starts, or drastic mood changes.Nowhere on this CD, or in its blurbs, do they claim to be selling us ""traditional"" Irish tunes or folksongs. I don't think it's fair to pan the CD, just because it's not traditional."
4,a solid 4 stars.,"Hey. If you are like me you don't just fling around five stars to just anybody. This CD is very good. It reminds me very much of Delerium's ""Semantic spaces"", though the beats are a bit more toned down, hence the trance. I gave it a listen and was quite pleased. Why then do I not give it the all-powerful, spine-tingling, make your hair feel like there's a zillion bugs in it, fifth star? just for that reason. no goosebumps. My personal idiosyncrasies aside, if you like ""DeepForest"" ""Delerium"",""Enigma"" or the like, you probabaly will like this. It is very smooth and definately sets a mood. If you are into pipes and low whistles, you may want to look elsewhere, they aren't very abundant on this cd. If you want a good CD that won't mess with your chi, pick this one up."
5,Informational Page-Turner!,"This book was a fantastic read! Not only did it describe and show you how to chart your signs of fertility it also went into great detail on how both the female and male reproduction system works, therefore making your own fertility signs make sense to you, rather than just charting and guessing on signs. This book addressed the Natural Family Planning method as well as the Fertility Awareness Method. It was written from a strictly informational point of view and doesn't try to shove any religious motive on you for trying the NFP method. Also, they include many examples to help you learn how to use the charting system and also include a blank chart for you to copy and use. I would highly recommend this book to anyone either considering using NFP or FAM or even to just become more aware of the way their body works! Excellent, excellent book."
4,1086 pages of Irish Literature!,"The Penguin book of Irish Fiction is a fine way to sample a variety of works by Irish writers, ranging from an excerpt of Gullivers Travels by Swift to James Joyce's The Dead. Some short stories are included in their entirety, but most of the novels are excerpted from the originals, which is fine if you just want to sample various writers or decide where to go from here... While planning a trip to Ireland, I found this book to be a good one volume education in Irish Literature. In fact, with 1086 pages of very small print, I doubt I can finish it in time."
4,Lovely selection,"I really love this book. A wide selection that covers many authors, styles and time periods. It is a great reference book and also very entertaining."
4,A solid grill with good features,The only issue that I had with assembly was figuring out which way the wheels went on the axle.......finally apparent that the caps had to fit in the recessed area.......the rest of the instructions were just fine.......no issues.Good instructions on seasoning the grill.........anyone that doesn't do that will be disappointed in the first cook.REALLY like the way it is put together and having 4 legs versus the 3 on a Weber kettle......that is what I had. Also like the fact of just raising the hood rather than trying to find somewhere to put it on the ground. The ash dump is seriously great.......almost as good as the can under the expensive Webers. Also the ability to control the temp is much better......and there is actually a gauge to read!Bottom line is this..........versus a Weber......this is much better! And the Burgers are great!!!
5,Loved it!!!,I am eight years old and I really like this Barbie and I've never had any messes using it. My friends play with it and we have lots of fun with the kitty and kitty litter. It's easy to pretend it's a real kitty.
3,gross!,Can anyone say gross?What is this supposed to teach a child?Is it supposed to teach them how a kitty pees?Is it supposed to them how to clean a litter box?Please don`t even get me started!Unless your trying to teach your child about how to potty train a cat it`s not a good idea to purchase this toy.
2,"I'm rating on this edition, not the book itself",The book itself is really good. But the English version is just overpriced and takes a long time to come out with a new volume.
3,OK,"This book had good reviews, but it seemed overly technical without context. For example, if some chemical compound was defined, the authors did not explain how that chemical compound is used, how it can be used, etc."
2,A book that attacks the Right but ignores the Left Extremist,"The book gives an adequate view of Right Wing Radicals and rightly warns us about some views not consistent in a Freedom System of free speech. However, it ignores its own bias and failure to research where much of the disinformation and racial tensions and even bombings came from leftists extremists as outline in a book that details KGB Files in The Sword and the Shield. In the end, I have concluded that this book is nothing more than an attempt to counter conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans agenda meant for a responsible and reliable middle americans. The extremes seldom are right anytime and this books only attacks one side so the book itself is an extreme attack exactly what they are trying to stop, prevent or make people think. I think it is a sham for this reason along with many reviews whom I respect but question."
3,Check the size before buying,"When I bought them, I didn't expect them to be so big. That is my fault and although I've grown to love them, they are a bit too big for everyday wear."
1,Author guilty of altering historic documents - latest news,"It is unfortunate that this author has damaged his own reputation by altering a significant historical document. It has been confirmed by the National Archives that Thomas Lowry modified an April 1864 pardon written by President Abraham Lincoln to read April 1865. He did this to bring credit and praise to himself for finding a document that would have been the President's last offical act before being assassinated later that night. However, the National Archives discovered that Lowry modified the document, and he admitted to changing it to glorify himself as a Civil War historian. I am sorry, but people should not support him or provide him money by purchasing this book, regardless of the value of the content. Sex in the Civil War might have been a lurid tale, indeed, but not as shameful as what Lowry has done to a valuable historical document."
3,Lowery leaves something to be desired,"Lowery does a good job of presenting some fact that are normally left out of civil war studies. However, the book is not a scholarly piece of work. It consists of many anecdotes from letters and reports, but does not for an instant analyze any of the information presented. It also contains some seemingly irrelevant information about swearing, as well as others. Overall, it is easy to read and for the most part fun, but lacks substance."
1,Too much melodrama for me,"My previous review was deleted because I used the word ""dreck.""This book would trade the massacres of Rwanda and Burundi for a soapy Mill Valley love affair, and I think that's tragic. A thoroughly disappointing book."
1,Waste of money,"got this DVD sent to Hong Kong. I like zombie movies for those made with good special effects, this one... I dont' even want to rate it.Some of the lines are funny as English Jokes, as a Non-native speaker I can get some of them... but I think zombie movies are not to be just full of dirty jokes without a good job in gore scenes at all...waste of my money while I had to pay US$21 for this one."
3,Not worth the money I payed,"I recently ordered these earrings and though they are beautiful, they look much different in reality than on the internet. I assume it is the quality of the picture provided, but I thought (before I purchased)that the earrings would be very thick and sturdy. Instead I recieved earrings that feel a little cheep and flimsy. In my opinion, the picture gives a viewer the impression that the earrings are made of gold that has been 'woven' together. Sadly, they are nothing more than a (very)thin layer of gold that has been pored into a mold."
2,A Man to Call My Own,"I was so disappointed with the content of this book. It is very shallow, no plot, no character development. A waste of time"
2,Must have been written by a Ghost writer for Lindsey,"I have read all of the Mallory Novels except two, I have read many other Johanna Lindsey novels, and I swear, this is not her writing. This book had to have been written by a ghost writer or the editorial staff tore apart all of the dialogue, because there is not much dialogue in this book. The whole thing is a monologue inside each character's head, in order to ""hurry up the story"". I am so disappointed that I wasted my valuable time on this book. I liked the premise of the book about identical twins of different tempermant, I like that they were wealthy and had to leave the East and travel out West, and I liked the hero's background. The many twists and turns in the story were very interesting but the book needed to be longer to develop the storyline better. The conflicts were OK, but as I said, too much in too short a time. Too bad!"
5,Beautiful,"I'm surprised at how many people disliked this book. I thought it was brilliant. I always love when a book is about a quiet girl who doesn't think she's pretty, and the hero tells her that she really is beautiful.I thought Amanda was horrible, as she was supposed to be thought of as. You were supposed to not like her.Overall I really thought it was a good story. I don't know why most of the other reviews think it was so bad."
3,A Little Better than her last book...but still not up to par,"Those of you who truly love her books will probably be disappointed, as I was. This book is better than The Pursuit (her worst book ever in my opinion, not worth the paper it was printed on) but it's still not as good as most of her other books. The plot was good. Twin sisters, both beautiful but one hides behind ugly glasses, the other is petty and jealous. The man of course sees the beauty on the outside first, but does finally get it right in the end and sees the beauty from within also. The book does not have good dialogue though...it was like poof...they are in love and pretty much skipped any real dialogue between them as to how and why they fell in love. Definitely not worth the hardcover $$$.Lindsay used to be an automatic buy for me as soon as the book came out. After her last 2 books, I am not so sure now."
3,Cheap but not totally worthless,For the price it's ok. It does the job but I had to tweak the legs a little to get them to stay open properly and now I don't move them so they stay where I want them. The price is good but for not much more money you probably can get a better tripod.
5,Great little tripod,I am using this tripod with a Canon EOS Digital Rebel Kit and it works great. Can't beat the price either!!
3,Shades of A Clockwork Orange,"Overall, you have to be impressed with Malkani's pyrotechnics. Jas's descriptions of his adventures was reminiscent of the style of A Clockwork Orange. Malkani's done his research in that the argot of these rudeboys rings true. However, Malkani seems to bend over backwards to make the machinations of his plotting work. The ending was so far removed from anything that had gone before that I was wondering whether it was slapped on to make some one from ""on high"" happy.It was a worthwhile read to get a glimpse of the desi culture. But you'll have to be prepared to suspend your belief when you get to the final pages."
1,difficult read,"I found the dialect difficult to understand, and most of the book is dialect without much in the way of background. You learn very little about the immigrant experience in England but a fair amount about teen age anxt. I could only read a few chapters."
1,"Wrong item, no help",It'd be nice if Adorama would ship the correct item. They insist I ordered a Kodak power supply and point the finger at Amazon. Amazon's order specifys Olympus. Now I'm out 3 shipping charges. Forget these guys. Buy local and put the extra you pay in a small business man's pocket.
5,Good socks for Lymphedema,"This is a good product for those suffering from lower-limb Lymphedema. It is especially useful for those patients who can't wear shoes due to foot swelling. The anti-skid stripes on the bottom of the sock provide decent traction on slippery floors, and the sock's elastic opening will stretch in order to fit swollen ankles. I recommend this as an essential item for anyone with lower-limb Lymphedema and/or anyone who, for whatever reason, cannot wear shoes."
5,Not Gould: Lloyd,"While I think Morton Gould is an underrated composer and Like his music, this review is misplaced. It should not be under highlights of anopera by George Lloyd, another much underrated (though fully recorded) composer"
4,Met my expectations,"This is a kitchy kind of choral group but that is what I was looking for, especially what I consider their frenetic version of ""I need a Little Christmas."" It's a hoot!"
5,one of the all time favorites,"This classic Christmas album is in the top three favorites ever. I purchased several as gifts for family who also love to get a jump start on the season with great music, and everyone of them loves it. A must have for anyone's Christmas collection!"
5,LOVE THEM!!,"I could not be any happier with these chairs!! GREAT purchase. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. Very sturdy chairs and the material is so soft. Great back support, love em, love em!"
3,chutzpah,"Do you want a recipe for how to become an instant writer of 'spiritual' lore? Go To Peru, adopt a couple of Peruvian orphans, superficially read a couple of tomes on Andean geography and 'shamanism', perhaps even take a tour or two.. and: lo! 'The Secrets of the Ancient Incas"" is born. I give Langevin three stars for pure chutzpah. Needless to say, this book is not about 'ancient Incas', it is all about Langevin (what a great guy he is...etc..heh heh) and perhaps you will find buried in between the all too mundane travelogue a few New Age practices that fit quite well within the Magical Blend but have little to do with the Inka.At least he is sincere and does not make things up, which is an achievement in itself if one considers the feeding frenzy that plagues popular Andean shamanism these days. If you want more substance, I'd go for Williams, Villoldo, or even Wilcox"
5,A must-have!,All of my lenses have one of these little keepers on them. It's simply a must-have to keep the caps out of trouble. I've lost a cap or two without a keep and these hold up under tough conditions.
2,"Would be good, except...","This was an excellent product until the shoddy string that connects to the elastic band broke. I've tried reconnecting them, but it keeps coming loose. Too bad."
1,Don't Be Crazy!,Don't Be Crazy! I just bought this EXACT same item today for $2.69 at my local camera store!
1,works for about three weeks,Not a good value since the gummy part that holds the keeper to the cap is only good for about three weeks. If you own a Nikon you know this won't work since the lens caps for this camera can behave like they belong in a space program. If you do not get them right on the camera they can pop off and launch themselves into the stratosphere. I almost took out a friends eye with one of the lens caps. Please NIkon put a little hole someplace on the lens so we can attach our leashes.
1,Poor quality,The elastic came apart and the string came loose when I tried to place it on the body of the lens. The attachment to the lens worked ok and seemed durable. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is a clever idea but poor quality defeats its purpose.
5,It Works!,"It attaches my lens cap on my lens body!! It is black! The sticky bit is sticky and the rest isn't!! It has a string!Really, it works fine and costs very little. No more wondering where I left that cap."
1,Find a film that is not folded...,"This film product arrived folded in a zip lock bag. Since it is a two-ply product, the folds seem to have stretched the film. Therefore, application was difficult and not uniformly smooth. It really does not look professional. The vendor should provide the product in a tube, not folded. Until it is re-packaged, it is my suggestion that you do not purchase this item."
3,Pooch cookie,"I thought I would try this dog cookie for my miniature poodle because I had bought her some cookies on Amazon last Christmas that she really loved but weren't available any more. Unfortunately, they weren't her cup of tea. She is not agressive at breaking up large cookies, and they were a bit big for her, and a little too hard for me to break up. She also did not seem overly interested in the taste on the rare occasion I was able to break a piece off. I would suggest these more for a larger dog due to the size and hardness."
2,Definitely not worth the price,"I bought this because my truck came with a Roll-N-Lock tonneau cover pre-installed on it and this is the protectant the manufacturer says to use. After using it, I wish I'd just gone with one of the vinyl protectants I've used before like Armor All or Meguiars. It doesn't seem to leave anything on the cover to protect it. There's no slightly greasy/slick feeling, and it doesn't even make the cover look better. It's not any darker than if I had just wiped it clean with soap and water.Roll-N-Lock says that the only lubricant you're supposed to use on the tracks is this, but if it doesn't leave any kind of grease/slickness behind, how can this possibly lube the tracks? It certainly didn't make my cover any easier to close. WD-40 doesn't last very long, but at least it lubes the tracks for a little while.I'm giving this 2 stars because it does clean the cover approximately like soap and water would, but you'd definitely be better off buying something else."
5,decaf lifeboat is outstanding,"1 Best dang tea I ever had. Better than PC Tips, Lyon, etc.2 Now I have to use decaf, and it tastes just like the regular to me.3 Strong* enough to brew in double size cup and still be strong.4 Doesn't go bitter*, even overnight, even if you leave the teabag in!* These last two make it extra economical!"
2,Weak tea!,"I purchase English tea for the strength of the brew, this stuff is VERY weak compared to PGTips! I have to use two teabags per cup! If you like strong English tea avoid this stuff! Unfortunately I now have 6 boxes to get through."
1,It's too bad this isn't Teriyaki!!!,"I ordered this product 3 months ago and there was a problem. You open up the box that says ""Teriyaki"" but you find ""Sweet & Hott"" packages instead. Amazon told me Sorry and to try again later. I told them the manufacturer (Pemmican) made a mistake and Amazon should get it taken care of. I figured 3 months would be plenty of time for this to be sorted out. But as you can tell, it hasn't. My order which came 2 days ago, is once again ""Sweet & Hott"". Wow!"
2,So Boring,"PRO: The book covers so much details.CON: Many examples are not ""real-world"". Many wordy explanations even for simple problems. Bad organization"
3,Kindle edition Black and White,"The story is an excellent story, and great for asking my students to make inferences. I bought the kindle edition to use with my PC app, and am disappointed that the kindle edition has no color. It is still a great story with very good illustrations."
4,good powder for my skin,"I purchase the ""Stay Matte Powder Oild Free No.3"" very often. Buying online is cheaper but the shipping and handling cost is high for the small items like this. But anyway, the product is good and suitable for my skin and I use it daily for my making up."
5,HIGH,"The product is high quality, the purchase was made with a exicto impressive, I am very satisfied with your purchase.Clinique Stay-Matte Sheer Pressed Powder Oil-free .27oz/7.6g Stay Neutral 02"
3,"So you like run-on sentences, huh?",This is another one of those novels that has been on my reading list for years but could never find it well what do you know I found it in the that same clearance book store what a stroke of luck I don't know if I liked this or not you see the writing was a little hard to get used to you see it's written in the first person by a very disturbed Irish boy and the sentences tend to run on with sparce punctuation and no quotation marks for dialogue but what starts off as annoying becomes easier and puts you inside this disturbing little mind if you can put up with this kind of writing for 200 pages go for it it's not bad after all it was short-listed for the prestigious Booker prize and it's truly a unique reading experience although if this were a 600 pager I couldn't have done it.
1,One star is too generous,"I really don't understand what all the fuss was about over this book. Yes, the first forty pages or so are fairly entertaining with their childish humour, but after that, it was just one mind-numbing, expletive-filled page after another. Unfortunately, I had to read the entire thing for an English class; otherwise, it would have become firewood a heck of a lot sooner."
4,Locked In Time,"The book Locked in Time is a really good book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I wanted the bad people to get caught. They acted as though they only had one way out, and that was by death. I think they shouldn't have killed themselves. They should have admitted their crimes. Maybe they could have lived their lives out in the open. I think that this would be a good book for anyone to read one character lets everyone know that you don't have to run away from your problems. She stays strong the whole way through. Another reason I think you might want to read it is because sometimes you don't always realize what someone might do for love. In this novel a life is given for love."
2,What a lot of garbage,"This book was simply a waste of time. I don't even know why it was included in our 8th grade english curriculum. A book about a mystical evil woman who becomes immortal and eternally youthful through voodoo(?), as well her never-aging children. In addition, their charcters never evolve or will evolve (the evil mother, Lin or something, telling her daughter that she'll never mature) equally stupid. Thus, they are 'Locked in time' forever, and she keeps ensaring unsuspecting rich men into her trap until finally a dashing heroine has the guts to escape and put and end to these nefarious, but completely unoriginal, schemes. Interpersed are steamy romances and hysterics. The whole thing might have been taken from 'Arabian Nights' with a few modifications."
5,A Review For Locked In Time,"I have read a lot of books by Lois Duncan, and out of the ones that I have read this was the best one. When I first started reading it I thought it was going to be boring, but then I continued to read it and I couldn't put it down. It did get a little confusing but in the end I understood it. I was never sure what would happen between Nore and Gabe but I was shocked with what did happen. I was surprised with the ending when... well if you want to now what happens your going to have to read it for yourself."
3,Locked in Time,This book has you wondering one the very first chapter.. the ending was a little dissapointing though.
3,A Technical Exercise for Logicians and Scientists,"Belnap and Steel's text has been cited quite a number of times in journals dedicated to Arificial Intelligence and subjects like Erotetic logic, the logic of questions and answers. It is a highly analytical work that treats both the grammar and the semantics of ordinary question-answer units. It is not for someone who wants an easily accessible general discussion of what questions are all about. However, for those who are involved in computer programming or the development of artificial intelligence, it is a classic."
5,Tractor Paint,The exact color of the tractor. Brushed on evenly. Made the paint job easier.Will continue to use this paint for future projects.
1,Wrong size,Amazon had this as the suggested case for my new Casio EX-H20GBK Camera which I love. The case however is too small for this camera and you can't even squeeze the camera in. I'm sure the case is fine but it doesn't fit the camera that Amazon said. I contacted Casio and they told me they don't currently have a compatible case for the EX-H20GBK.
1,Doesn't fit Exilim EX-10H,"This case looks OK for a small case, decent quality. It does not fit the EX-10H camera."
1,Addition to my review,"The version of the film I was commenting on is from the Italian DVD print which has an English version. Yes, its true, Anchor Bay is the only company that can decently put out anything. If what everyone here is saying is true, (and there's too many to be wrong) then forget this version and contact DCS Video Screams. Thats where I got my copy. It's still not the best video quality, but at least the violence was in tact..."
2,No Widescreen????,"Dario Argento's stylish and ultra-gory giallo is a return to form for the maestro and will definitely please his long-time fans. Unfortunately, it looks like Artisan's upcoming DVD will be FULL-FRAME only and not widescreen as previously announced(...). So buyer beware. If you really want to see ""NONHOSONNO"" in it's correct aspect ratio, pick up the Italian DVD instead (if you have a region-free player) because it is uncut, letterboxed and has an english track. Obviously Artisan is just releasing their ""Sleepless"" version as just another cheap horror title to fill up Blockbuster shelves. Unbelievable that even in 2001 Argento is still treated this way in the US. No wonder he stays in Italy."
4,Light as a Feather in A Gale,"This is one of a handful of albums that reduce me to a misty-eyed idiot. The sound here is pretty unique - the dobro grounding the bottom registers with a kind of Latin-English mix. It makes weepies like the title track work, despite the slight lyrics. A pity they didn't make another album."
5,First of a million listenings...,"I rarely write any reviews here, but I had to say something about this album. It is one of my all-time favorites, and I definitely recommend it. If you like pop, or even some light jazz, this is great. Eddie Reader has a wonderful voice, and all the songs are great. Hallelujah takes you to another time and place... My favorites are Hallelujah, The wind knows my name, Find my love, and of course the hit song Perfect... I have had this album for over ten years and I still listen to it; I never get tired of it... Get this one, and if you like it, give Ay Fond Kiss a try."
4,A Good Reference to Go Along With a Beginner's Guide,"This is a good reference on the Tree of Life and its other hermetic correlations.However, I would recommend different text for beginners. Maybe text from Bardon, Key to the True Kabbalah would serve as a good introduction, as would Dion Fortune's text, The Mystical Qabalah. Use this as a companion, not as a sole source.And I'm not sure how I feel about the Cicero's commentaries and additions. Take what you want, leave the rest, I guess. I do like Regardie's writing styles and continue to reference his books, despite the additions that have been done by Chic and Tabitha to his books."
1,"Great Story Potential, Amateurishly Executed","'Shadow of China' has so much going for it: a multi-layered story involving mainland China and Hong Kong; the protagonist fleeing China and moving up in the world, yet still saddled with a dark past; the imminent take-over from the British....pity it is so amateurishly executed.John Lone and Vivian Wu are attractive leads, but the scripting and direction are poor, to say the least.The clumsy dialogue is played with lines delivered as if chiseled in stone, and there are next to no scenes that really pick up enough to make you forget the school-play-like staging.When a film makes you cringe each time a 'clever' line is spoken, something is very wrong.Some beautiful mood shots of cloud-draped Hong Kong appear from time to time, but that is far from enough to carry this one.This could have been a riveting, even explosive story (given the main character's background), but instead it becomes a casebook example of how not to write and direct a feature film.CH."
2,Fair,Shadow of China is about a Chinese revolutionary who escapes to Hong Kong. There he builds a financial empire. His dreams are threatened by exposure. A boring film. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS.
3,Not very innovative,"This movie is ok for an entertaining evening of fluff. It's a movie that's supposed to be a take-off on the Christmas Carol idea of three ghosts visiting a guy to help him realize that he lives an unfulfilling life of womanizing but really should be with his first love. Mostly the movie comes off as stale and not very innovative. You can see almost every plot twist coming from a mile away and most of the characters are tired cardboard cutouts of ones we've seen many times before in other movies. This is not the kind of movie where you come away thinking or caring much about the characters. In spite of that, the movie is watchable and worth taking a look at if you like the kind of movie in which two people who have had relationship issues for years end up getting together."
1,Avoid At All Costs,"This pathetic adaptation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol should be avoided at all costs. It is unintelligent, immoral, irreverant, uninspiring (except for a couple of minutes towards the end) and altogether disappointing. Charles Dickens must have been turning over in his grave with every worthless frame of film."
1,sheer disappointment,This movie makes you tired. Not even entertaining. Bad story line and you just dont CARE whats going on.
2,ugh,"I guess I should have known better... it just didn't like the whole ""sexual""inclinations in this movie. Iwould have preferred a nice romantic classic, but this one was not. Just not my taste."
4,Great Romantic Comedy. You will love it.,This is a great movie. It has a few twists and turns that you don't normally see in a Romantic Comedy. Jennifer Garner and Matthew McConnahy (sp) were both very good. I saw it at the theatre and really wanted to have it at home to watch again and again. If you like You've Got Mail and Lake House you will like this.
1,Damaged,I own this shoe in other colors but received the olive and it had a sharp nailhead coming through the sole. Too much of a hassle to return!!!
3,Eh. Not that special anymore.,"Whatever it was that made Chupacabra ""different and special"" -- the lyrics, Imani's clear and strong voice, the rhythm -- is gone. Don't buy it expecting to hear Imani. If you are into over-hashed voices that are barely recognizable due to the electronics, then this is for you.But don't expect ""special"". Don't expect ""different"". Before, her differentness and specialness were in a category of her own, maybe closer to ""They Might Be Giants"" than to the usual Sheryls of the world. Now, Imani is as ""different and special"" as any other alternative singer today.Sorry. I still listen to Chupacabra intently, and don't see myself giving this CD a sixth thought. But I still give it 3 stars, because as a CD, it is ok. Just doesn't blow my mind is all. Where did the fun go???"
3,Read Philip K Dick instead,"I have to admit I didn't finish it. But I tried. I loved Denis Johnson's Tree of Smoke and Already Dead. This book was written much earlier that they were, and the author wasn't nearly as good when he wrote this book as he later became. The others are beautiful. This is not."
4,Good Toy,I think this toy is very good for children of all ages. It helps them learn motor skills that will help them throughout their life. It makes them think about how to put things together and form objects. As a child this toy is fun and entertaining. It keeps the child's interest as they are putting it together and then afterwards as they play with it. All together it is a great toy for kids to play with and learn from.
3,OK,"Not a mystery in the true sense, but it was interesting in a different way. No one is murdered and there is no detective trying to unravel a crime. It's a story about an ordinary 50-ish man who finds himself with a 30-ish wife whom he grows to love and how he deals with life's challenges, including an overbearing relative. Through logical means he comes to a decision that ends up in what could be a terrible mistake. The last part of the book is more like a comic chase scene from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" than anything found in a suspense book. Enjoyable but, again, not a mystery."
4,Anna Karenina,"Wonderful, beautiful and interesting story. A hard, slow read however. Have some patience when reading and be persistent, it's worth the read."
5,Great read!,"This is a classic read but is still easy to read and follow along. I think everyone can relate to the themes of family, adultery, and internal conflict. The book is over 800 pages!"
3,Congress And its Members,This book is very not worth with information. It highlights the constitution as it should be understood. It is a good read.
2,"Typical ""Occult"" trash","Like a lot of other so-called ""occult"" works, this book spends a lot of time ranting about how ""ignorant"" everyone else is while hinting that there are ""secrets"" which the author knows...but doesn't divulge. In other words the entire book can be summed up as ""I know something you don't know...nah, nah, nah, nah, boo boo"". If you want to write a book telling me something I don't know, that's cool...but if you just wanted to let me know that you're privy to some great secret that I'm not cool enough to be told about, then go screw yourself."
4,Works!,The cap could be redesigned: retractable head or attached cap? Users will loose the cap in one or two uses especially on a crowded desktop.Otherwise everything works excellently.
2,Non-existent customer service,"I am having some problems with my receiver and, from what I've found, you can't contact a live customer support rep if your life depends on it. I've sat on hold for hours trying to get someone. Complete joke."
5,Awesome book for diabetics on adjustable insulins!,"Almost anything you can think of is listed in this book. Most diabetics have scales so it's easy to see how many carbs are in foods, including fast food! I base all of my insulin amounts on carbs eaten so I couldn't live without this book. I highly recommend it but just be sure and get the latest edition, which is this one - 16th."
4,"Love the contents, paperback hard to handle","I have used this book in an earlier edition, and I want it again, so I am checking the Amazon site. I only found it in paperback, like the one I borrowed from the library to see if I liked the 16th edition as well as my earlier book (loaned it out, can't find it). I do like it, since it includes restaurants, brand name foods and calorie counts, but it was a pretty new borrow, and tight, so thumbing through or locating pages was difficult. I am going to look for a hard cover, or a larger soft-cover copy. The contents are great for my needs, though!"
5,Great Book!,"A lot of great info you won't find in the ""standard"" travel books. Good historical stuff too."
5,great metal,"This is a great metal album, one of my favorites. This band sounds almost like Children of Bodom but more aggressive and i different sounding vocalist with better lyrics. The twin guitar harmonies sound absolutely amazing like on ""Hades"". My favorite tracks are Hades and Alteration. Get Kalmah's other albums also because they are just as creative and melodic and fast."
5,Dave Weckl strikes again!,"After Rhythm of the soul, Dave Weckl and his guys made a fantastic CD! I think they are all good players, especially Dave Weckl (the best), Tommy Kennedy (amazing!) and Jay Oliver (fantastic)! [per gli italiani] ehi, se ve ne intendete di Jazz, o anche se siete capitati in questa pagina per puro caso, COMPRATELO! E' IL MIGLIORE! Non ve ne pentirete,anzi poi mi ringrazierete.. e mi chiederete quale concezione avete avuto della musica prima dell'ascolto di questo esaltante CD... la migliore è : HIGHLIFE"
2,Worked great for one year then stopped collecting moisture.,"This unit worked great for one summer. I did not need it during the winter so it was not turned on. The unit stopped collecting moisture within a month of being used this year. Unfortunately, one week after the warranty expired."
4,if you like gold and shiney...,"If you like gold and shiney, then you'll love these earrings. They are very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that sometimes the dangle drop gets hung up by its connector ring."
1,"Looks good, works poorly","The one I bought doesn't work well. I bought it to control a Dishnetwork receiver in another room. The Receiver is pointed at the Dish receiver and is only about 10-feet away. The Transmitter is in the other room, and is also about 10-feet away with a wall between them. It will pick up some keypresses, but is basically very unreliable and doesn't really work well."
1,Do not buy!!!,"The IR receiver unit (the one you point your remote at) only has a 5 ft or so range, so you have to place it right by the remote you are holding. I bought one of these at best buy, exchaged it, and the other one did the same thing. Poor design. look elsewhere."
3,This book suet only beginners.,I found this book as good starting reference. If you just have minimal idea on computer you may try this. I looked for internal view how windows XP system working. This book doesn't do it.It the first time I disappointed from SAMS publishing.
3,"Not impressed...poor quality design, decent sound.","Wow, the wind screen is a JOKE! It is HUGE, literally about the size of a penny. The cable is ridiculously short, and of poor quality (the kind that feels plastic-y and wants to tangle all the time). There was no extra background noise with adjusted settings; however, I just didn't like how my voice sounded. I have a deeper voice and it just didn't replicate it how I wanted.Plus, it is funky...the receiver is on the front, rather than pointed up? It may seem minor to some, but on professional broadcasts you never see them with this kind of lavalier. If you want to look more professional, look elsewhere...this mic makes you look amateur because of this.The power unit is fat and clunky, the storage bag is cheap and unusable. I feel Shure is just going off of their name with this and hoping people buy it.I ended up going with a Audio-Technica AT899 and am thrilled with that choice. I returned the Shure back to Amazon."
4,A very Good CD,If You Have Seen the film the Battle of Britain this is the CD you want it is briliant especially if you like some of the music in the film. Especially battle in the air at the end of the film with the big dogfight over London. A very worthwhile buy.
2,Could Have Been Worse...but I don't see how!,"A spiral bound self published book by an author who, I am sure, knows a lot about the subject of quilts. He made an excellent effort at putting together this book, but the pictures were disappointing as most of the quilts were laying flat and one could not get a good feel for the patterns. Also, the ""color photographs"" mentioned are really poor copies of color photographs taped to the page. For the price of this book I would have expected a more professional product.Also, while he did mention the importance of stitching, he didn't show good examples of stitching such as quilting designs within the actual quilt pattern, how many stitches per inch, evenness of stitches, etc.I'll give him credit, though, for putting effort into the book and I am sure it will be helpful to someone who know's nothing of quilts--but not me."
4,Louisiana And Black Military Heritage,"A book is a valuable resource on a subject little is known about Southern but Union Negro Soldier . These are men that served the Union cause in their home state . I wish it had covered the long history of the Black soldier in Louisiana beginning in 1727 with the Spanish and French continuing without pause through state hood up to including service first as Confederate forces then becoming Union. These were mostly "" free men of color "" of Louisiana who would be the first Black men to successfully serve and fight as a combat force for the cause of the Union and the freedom of other Black citizens . Their success proved to the political leaders of the North the viability of raising Black combat soldiers . A really good additional resource book is little 48 page book "" Negro Soldiers : In the Battle of New Orleans "" by Marcus Christian it is hard to find and expensive maybe you can find a copy in your library . This"
3,Good starter book,"I'm an engineer becoming familiar with fiberoptics. This book is very oriented towards the non-engineer. Much space is devoted to explanation of terms dB, and basic laws of physics.The issue of multimode vs single mode is handled too cavalierly. The reader is left faced with an undesirable trait of fibers without sufficient explanation of the eigen values or transmission theory. This is good starter book only."
4,My daughter loves it!,My daughter loves watching Jojo's circus on TV and now she has her very own Jojo! It makes her laugh and smile all the time.
5,Great product and service!,Arrived quickly and just as described. Thanks for being a pleasure to work with! Will do business with again! Thanks!
3,Why Do Record Companies Do This to Us?,"Yes, ""No Myth"" is one of my favorite albums too. And Michael Penn is top notch. So why leave out a track from the bonus album ""Free for All"" (not even mentioned in this re-issue's title) for an audience that is likely to be made up of obsessive collectors? Record companies do this all the time. Reason enough to scour the Web for other alternatives.The gaffe makes rating this item a difficult task, the quality of the material starkly at odds with the packaging decision.Man, there was no reason for this."
1,How I go through a million batteries,"Buy this walkman and you will find out...the buttons to turn the radio on are on the front. If you throw the walkman in a book bag or purse or wherever, the buttons are sensitive enough to turn the radio on without you knowing. So, you go through a million gazillion batteries.Another feature that is missing and can't figure out why it isn't included is continuous tape playing. Once the tape is over on side 1, it doesn't flip over to side two. If you are walking and listening to a tape, then you have to pull it out of the belt clip holder, flip over the tape and continue listening.I usually love Sony products, but this is one of the blunders they have made."
3,No DC electrical adapter,"I bought one of these, along with a Sony power adapter that said you could use it to plug your Walkman into your car's electrical power. It turned out that Sony's latest Walkman units HAVE NO JACK for the electrical adapter! I want a player strictly for use in the car (to plug into the Aux input in the car's stereo system), and I don't want to worry about carrying batteries.Fortunately, the store let me return the player & the adapter."
1,Possibly dangerous product - be careful,"This product sounded very good, and had some nice features likean easy to use remote. But, within a week it had shorted out anddestroyed two speaker systems. Loud explosion in house, smell ofburning circuitry. Obviously, no output protection circuits. I am trying to get through to Sherwood, but they have not responded to phone calls or e-mails for almost two weeks and I am preparing to take my complaint to appropriate consumer protection agencies.----Note, I emailed, called Sherwood several more times and even tried to get the company I bought it from involved, but never have had the courtesy of a response. Zip. Stay away."
3,Just average,"This is an OK 2 channel reciever, however, the KLH R-3100, which is also 100 watts per channel, seems to have much better audio quality for about the same price."
2,This is NOT the pilot for the series!,"Please be warned that this is NOT the pilot for the series ""The Quest"", as might be assumed from the cast list. You won't find Brian Keith and Cameron Mitchell anywhere on this DVD, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, is really just a two-part episode from the series itself. While the two-parter itself is fairly good, it doesn't hold a candle to the pilot. Oh, how I wish that one was on DVD!"
2,Not worth the money,"Sorry, but I was not impressed. Very lame. Adults will not like this. If you have kids that like westerns (and those types of kids are a vanishing breed) then you might want to get this if it is cheap enough. Otherwise, don't waste your money. Kurt Russell is really bad in this, lapsing in and out of his stilted ""indian accent"". And, unfortunately, he might be the best thing about this two part TV show.I did read the other reviews before I bought it and I don't fault those reviewers, but my recommendation is save your money."
2,Buyer Beware,"The other reviews tell a lot of the story -the hits from the first 1976 album are NOT the originalrecordings and appear to be demos, some very cheesy.Even ""It Feels Good"", the great single from their 3rd albumseems to be the original recording, but in greatly remixedform, and the results are not an improvement. However, there'sa lot of rare tracks here for Bruce Blackman fans, although the Korona hit ""Let Me Be"" is not included. The artwork and liner notes are really excellent. (The Moonlight Feels Right CD with the original 1976 LP and 5 bonus tracks from the 1977 LP has great sound and packaging, and is the original recordings.)"
1,Cheap but you get what you pay for.,Gets interference all the time. When I press the channel buttons they don't always go to the channel. I have to press more then once. It was difficult to find a good corresponding radio channel. Not near as good as my old Starmate. I'm thinking Sirius may not be worth it.
4,Radio,Great small radio. The fm transmitter is a little weak but I live in the country and it works well most of the times.The only real issue I have are the buttons are difficult to press...have to press hard for the stations to change.
4,Great Small Satellite radio,I bought this at BestBuy with a free $30.00 gift card. I used the gift card to purchase a FM direct adapter. The sound is great and no static. The installation took a couple of hours. I would recommend a service manual for your car to take out the radio to install the direct adapter.
2,Plug it in,Don't buy if you plan to use the radio feature. It does not provide a signal clear enough to clear the static. It would be fine if you had a plug in.
2,Worst FM Transmitter ever.,"The Radio it's self is ok but the built in FM modulator is the worst thing i have ever tried. i installed the radio right before a road trip and i spent the entire trip changing radio stations trying to keep the sat radio listenable. was a dangerous item to have since i was paying more attention to changing the stations on my car radio to find on that it would play on. stay away unless your radio has an aux input, if yours does then the radio is fine works great and great price.SIRIUS SV3-TK1 Stratus Plug-and-Play Satellite Radio Receiver with Car Kit"
1,ummm,you guys should have said in the review it was a FAKE bowler hat that has like I don't know a cardboard shell around it..
4,Hitler hadn't a real secret service,"I read this good book, here in Brazil.This book is short,correct and is about how to deceive an enemy.The operation with the code name ""micemeat"" was the use of a cadaver, to made Hitler to think about an anphibious landing in Greece, not in Sicily, as it was.Failures of this book are small.To example, it doesn't has the name of the cadaver.The name was showed, some years ago.Also this book doesn't shows that an anphibious landing in Greece was a better idea, than Italy's invasion in 1943."
2,Shorter lifespan than a hamster!,"Like a previous reviewer, I got my unit in Dec. 2010. The first one would not work at all - an obvious power or motor problem. I contacted Sony, and was shipped another new unit which arrived two weeks later. It worked well for me and I treated it with great care. After perhaps 150 hours total use, this week it just quit working. It acts like it is getting no power, and from what I've read, this is typical that the motor dies. It wasn't that expensive but I expected better from Sony. I won't buy anything with their name on it in the future."
1,"Very disapointed, and a waste of money","My sister, and I wanted to buy a gift for my father's 60th birthday. He has all these record's, that he has been wanting to play, but no turn table anymore. So I got on the trusted Amazon.com, and found the Sony turntable that fit our budget,and had great reveiws. When we recieved the turntable, and tried to assemble the unit the needle was bent. My father quickley went out to replace the needle, in the meantime I contacted Amazon, wanting to send back the Sony turntable. Amazon said that I had to purchase the turntable again, and then send back the damaged unit. Unable to afford to purchase another turntable, I took it to a professional to see if it could be fixed, the guy said it would cost more money to get it to work, then what it was worth. After everything, the turntable is at the Salvation Army, never been used by our family. Beware of purchasing items on Amazon, due too the poor customer service, and bad return policies."
5,I bought it as a gift and haven't heard from the recipient yet.,"I gave this as a gift; the recipient hasn't hooked it all up yet, so I'm guessing on these answers. He was delighted to receive the turntable, the price was great and shipping was terrific and fast, but the exact item? Can't tell ya yet."
3,Good if you want to replace it in a few years,"While it lasts, this is a great turntable. I've had it for a few years and haven't had any problems with it (until now). And if you're considering getting a turntable that's this cheap, you probably don't have expensive enough speakers to notice any difference between this turntable and a high-end audiophile turntable.But as other reviewers have noted, there's not much you can do with this after the stylus wears out. The manual says that happens after 500 hours of play (I listen to a lot of old, beat-up records, so it happened a lot earlier for me). After that, you pretty much need to buy a new turntable. The cartridge isn't replaceable at all (I think this has become standard for main-stream brand turntables), and a new stylus costs about $55, more than half the cost of the entire machine. 500 hours isn't much when you can get a turntable from another brand such as Audio-Technica for only about twice the price that will last you a lifetime."
4,affordable turntable works great,"I purchased this turntable for all our old records. It is plenty good enough to play them, and the price was much lower than I could get in our local stores. Great deal. Our kids are now listening to the Beatles, Eagles, and yes....Abba!!"
1,Fine if your records are all perfect...,"I have a good-sized vinyl record collection, and I wanted to rip all that music into my computer. What I experienced with my first 10 albums is not encouraging. On about half of the albums I kept getting skips on a significant fraction of the tracks I ripped. About half the albums had one or more tracks that would skip. Sometimes 5 or 10 skips on a single track. I became suspicious because I never remembered that much of a problem with my collection, so I replayed them on my 25-year-old JVC component turntable. Most skips disappeared.The problem seems to be that there is no adjustment contols to allow changing the tracking force or the anti-skating force.Do yourself a favor. If you want to rip your vinyl collection to your computer, and you already have a reliable turntable, just get a phono preamp and put it between your turntable and sound card. Amazon sells a good selection of them for less than a third of the price of this turkey."
4,Very nice equipment for the price.,This piece of equipment is not bad for the price. If you have a nice sounding stereo system to connect the record player then you shouldn't have any worries.
2,Lousy Quality Control at Sony and Elsewhere,"I've bought 5 appliances this year that have worked a week or less, or not at all: a Conair AND a Wahl hair trimmer, a Teac CD changer [from Amazon], and a Sony camcorder. What is happening with quality control any more?From Amazon I purchased this turnatable which worked for a week. Then, everytime the needle touched down on the record, it instantly lifted back up and returned to its resting hook, then turned off.Its tough enough reaching a decision to buy a certain model or product, but to have to go thru the hassle of returning it has me soured on buying. I'll make my TV, my computer and my monitor do, even though I'd like, and I have the money, to replace them, because I'm fed up with lousy workmanship and repacking stuff for returns."
1,Still waiting for the rapture fairy.,"I laugh at these rapture hustlers -- Hal Lindsey, Tim LaHaye and Pat Robertson -- who've all reached their 80's by now without getting raptured. Assuming that Lindsey believes what he's preached for the past 40 years, does he look at his aged face in the mirror in 2010 and wonder why he's wasted his life waiting for the rapture fairy (Jesus)?"
1,Bologna!,"I read this book in 1988, and even as a young believer who was into ""end times"" ideas, I found this to be a lot of non-sense. I found his Biblical ""analysis"" to be nothing more than sensationalism at worst, and horrible Biblical interpretation at best. I find it hard to believe that this man still has an audience after missing so many predictions over the years. Even if you believe in the ""Rapture"" there are much better books to read, and leaders to follow. Don't waste your time on the man who spent the late 70s and early 80s opening talks to Campus Crusade audiences with ""There are no prophecies that need to be fulfilled before Jesus' return. He may return before I finish speaking today."" Rational Biblical interpretation and theological sanity divorced this man years ago. Spend your time reading something that will actually help you understand the Bible, and not the odd ravings of a sensationalist."
1,Fundamentalist Hogwash,"This book is good if you want a way to read the bible that causes a feeling of fear and a false sense of impending big events. It's really cool to psych yourself out and use it as a ticket to get on the fundie ""end o' duh whirled"" crazy train. The pages can also be used as toilet paper in a pinch.Other than that, this book is worthless and it's author is a discredited loon since the rapture did not happen by 1981."
5,"One of Paul's best; heartfelt, genuine, and powerful","The Christian moorings of Paul Overstreet really shine like the stars of heaven in this particular album. Showing the beauty in both the everyday and the difficult trials, this is truly an album which will bless you all the years of your life. It is one of our families favorites."
5,Love it!,Our entire family absolutely loves this CD. AWESOME lyrics about family and love. Hats off to Paul Overstreet! He's a gem!
3,Too easy for kindergarten.,"This should be a preschool book. I like the book and its contents, but its too easy for my kindergartener."
3,"good, but could be updated","This is a very good book for preschool rather than kindergarten. Kindergarten goes so much farther than the topics covered in this book. It is a basic letter and concept book. I wish I had bought the first grade version. I would reccommend this for parents to prep their children the summer before kindergarten. It would be great for that. As far as being ""comprehensive"" kindergarten curriculum it is not."
1,Useless,"Frustrating, gets all kinked up and very hard to manage. If I weren't so lazy I would send it back."
3,good for small area,"The springhose is good for a small area. It is difficult to stretch to its full length, so don't plan on half the distance when choosing a length of hose to buy."
2,Poor craftmanship - Poor overall product,"The end of the hose (nozzle end) blew off the first time I connected the hose. Seems manufacturer forgot to crimp/secure the nozzle connector..... Used a ""hose clamp"" to repair and utilize.Hose tends to kink-up/twist often.Disappointed."
1,"High cost, limited use","I bought this hose for $36 after looking at number of alternatives in stores and on Amazon.I selected this 1/2 inch, 75 ft. coil model for use in my garage and to wash cars. I thought that the advertised hose length would be more than adequate to cover a 19' length garage and a car in front of it. However, I just went to use the hose and discovered that because it is tightly coiled, the 75' hose only results in a maximum usable length of 20'. This results in a very costly hose that has very limited use. It won't cover the inside of the garage nor a car infront of it. My suggestion is don't buy it and Amazon should change their product description to the real usable length of the hose. Currently their description is very deceiving."
3,good and bad,"The 1/2 inch diameter does not flow very much water. The coiled design is hard to go around corners and when extended you really can't put it down without it ""taking off"". Pluses- it does not kink and storage is a breeze(just drop it)."
2,disappointing,"There is some amazing music on this CD, but the over use of samples of people orgasming, I think ruined what potential it had. The underlying music is very groovy, the kind of stuff that you'de want to play when you have friends over for a drink before going out. But all the ""oow yeahs"" and ""oh-ohs"" make it too distracting, almost embarrassing to play out loud. I realize that this album is a tribute to the porn industry and a few of the traks are done quite tastfully, sexy and funny. But for the most part I thought it was tacky.Check out ""Music for Babies"" if your looking for good Howie B."
4,Splendid attempt to stay fresh sounding...,"The Judds could do no wrong in the 80's, but we all knew Wynonna was capable of doing so much more than what the 'Judds' recorded. This release begins to show us what Wy is capable of and it's nice. Although I'm one to yawn at such touchy-feely songs as ""Young Love""; most of the others are extraordinary and ground-breaking for the time period. ""One Man Woman"" is a haunting delight as is their Dire Strait's cover ""Water of Love"" which Mark Knopfler played guitar on. ""Not My Baby"" is a fun bluesy, old-styled song that is fun to listen to. ""River of Time"" is a very touching song and is so full of meaning and prophetic of Naomi's retire from the industry. ""Guardian Angel"" sums up what the Judds have been all along - down-home women with strong family values. This was the last strong release from the Judds and it shines with brightness, tenderness, playfulness, and is a gem in the Judd's fine collection."
4,A Fun Movie,"Ryden Malby had it all figured out. Make good grades in high school, get a great college scholarship, keep the scholarship, graduate, and then work at the best publishing company in LA. Only things don't go quite as she planned. Instead of getting the job, she ends up unemployed and living with her crazy family once again.Crazy is NOT an understatement.Add on to that, a hot Brazillian neighbor and Adam, a guy who's been her best friend since freshman year, yet wants to be more. That's the plot.The plot, while all over the place, works well for this movie. You're not sure what scheme one of the Malbys will come up with next. Will it be her father's plan to make a fortune online selling belt buckles or perhaps her grandmother (played by the ever amazing Carol Burnett) wanting to take a look at caskets? There's always something going on, with Ryden and her love life, or lack thereof, at the center of it all.This movie defintely takes you for a ride. One that I really enjoyed."
3,blah,it doesn't grab your attention you know the end 10mins into it. Its a movie we've all seen 1000 times before. Don't waste your money
4,A Truly Feel Good Movie,"This movie was one of the few I watched last year in theatres that made me feel good when I left...there was no death and destruction, no killings, no plots to take over the world...just a feel good, ""life happens"" movie...While I feel it sort of picked up where Rory Gilmore left off, it still was a down to earth, a little crazy, often too true movie of life.Alexis Bledel is an awesome actress and a beautiful young woman. I can hardly wait til they star her in a movie of top caliber and outside the ""Rory"" image (like Sin City).Buy the movie - it is well worth the value AND a good movie."
1,"Sad Script, Uninspired Direction","""Post Grad"" is a corny, rambling satire on today's job market, but hardly holds your attention, and if it is a comedy, I forgot to smile. The film frames a job hunt by a young college graduate Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) who is perky and optimistic. She always assumed she could find a job with a college diploma. She has a book publishing company as the first and only place to apply. She is among many applicants and the hard cruel world intervenes. The valedictorian of her class lands the job and Ryden's car is involved in an accident. She is forced to move back in with her dysfunctional family and look for anything to keep her afloat. In the meantime her steady comforting relationship with her best friend, Adam (Zach Gilford) comes apart. Ryden has to decide what is important to her: career or the man she loves.Overall, it is a pain to watch, the script screams for help, the talented cast cannot save it, and it drags through totally uninspired direction."
4,"Good, enjoyable movie",I thought it was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it. You would definitely like it if you are a recent college grad and had trouble getting a job - at least I think you would.
5,I've learned to love port!,"These wonderful little sippers are perfect for anyone who enjoys -- or wants to learn to enjoy -- a good port wine. The palm of one's hand wraps snugly around the glass and warms the port beautifully. A small sip at a time, and before you know it, the glass is empty! I have several sets of these myself, and I've given several as gifts. Friends who've used them at my home have also purchased them for themselves and as gifts for others. I never appreciated port until I drank it from one of these sippers."
4,Fun!,"I purchased these for my friends birthday. She loves her port. Thought this would be a fun and unique way to enjoy it. I would have given it a 5 star but the sipping edge on one of the sippers 'straw' had a fine needle of glass that pierced her lip. (she had to get the one w/ the defect) Her husband, thankfully had a diamond grade sand paper and easily buffed it smooth."
4,Great for young archers!,"Got this for my 8 year old son's birthday. He had begun archery class with the Cub Scouts and wanted something to practice with at home. This works perfectly, the draw weight and length are just right making it easy for him to practice good form.If you're looking for a ""toy"" with safety arrows, then this isn't for you. But if you are wanting a nice little starter set for ""real"" ...then this is really nice."
2,A necessary evil,"I ordered this with an Alpine INA-W910 from a reputable online/catalog retailer that begins with a ""C"".When I was ready to test out the system, I plugged the harness into my car and within a few minutes the GMOS-04 became VERY hot to the touch. In addition, the sound would not come through the speakers. I called tech support for where I purchased it and they said it sounded like a faulty unit. They quickly sent me another one and it worked perfectly.If there are any other options, I would like to know, as the quality seems pretty poor; it is just a circuit board that rattles around in a chunky plastic case.To all of those who complain about the chime noise, the nice feature is that you can totally turn off the volume."
1,Defected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this product 2 weeks ago and it arrived defected. The company wouldn't take it back since it was a car auto part and they don't take back car auto parts even if there defected. I would suggest trying to find a different product.
1,M.Heeczeg,Recieved part on time but package was opened and not new as advertized. Ended up throwing it out and hard wired my head unit in with out this adapter kit. Don't wast your money on this product.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this device for My 04 Monte Carlo. It arrived and was simple enough to connect to my car's wiring harness, despite the lack of included instructions. Unfortunately, that is where the ease ended. Not only did the door chime only work about 50% of the time, when it did work, you could barely hear it. An adjustment to the volume control on the device did nothing to help this. In addition, It made my back speakers sound like garbage (Sony xplod 6 x 9 4 way speakers). They sounded great before the install Hopefully, this will ward off anyone else who is thinking of making the mistake I made. Of course, Amazon gave excellent customer service as always by not only shipping the item quickly, but by accepting the return without any hassle."
4,SHE LOVED IT!,"Yes, although it may be a small ring, it's a classic. Solitaire diamonds on a round setting, are things we USED to see in movies. LOL. Needless, to say she loved the ring. So, it was worth it. Last minute deal, but worth every penny."
5,The Rx for Script Doctors -- and everyone else!,"""Veteran development executive Derek Rydall is the master of both script analysis and the intricacies of the film business. His proven methods for fixing plot holes -- and negotiating the ins and outs of script consultation -- give writers, producers and development executives the very latest techniques necessary to thrive."""
5,Great gift book,"I bought this book for my grown children (20,22) for Christmas to give them along with their savings bonds they've had since birth. It is an easy and interesting read, with a synopsis of all the important facts from Dave Ramsey's material. It would be good for a college graduation gift or even wedding gift too."
1,Fairy tale,For a grown up man to believe that the universe is younger than the youngest rocks on earth is laughable. I'm sure that it is a great fairy tale (right up there with L Ron Hubbard's work) but the word history is a great misnomer. Read it for a good laugh.
1,Completely inaccurate!!!!,"It doesn't mention what measures Noah took to avoid, prevent, alleviate or otherwise contain this phenomenon: (can't link here, but google 'Hippo Fart'). This problem is vexing enough for the traditional reading of the bible; but think about what a bit of dino faux pas would have added to the sum total of inter-species happiness on that stuffy creaky thing."
2,Avant Gauze Drain Sponges,"I use the drain sponges on my wife's feeding tube. I have used the Kendall Excilon Drain Sponges for a year with no problem. To save money I decided to change to the Gauze Drain Sponges. After just a couple of days use I noticed increased bleeding and irritation. The Gauze Drain Sponges may work well in different applications, in my case it was wasted money."
3,Are they real 14K Gold???,"I bought these earrings and they are nice, but no where on them does it say 14K. They are stamped ISRAEL. Did I get real 14K gold earrings?"
1,"Misleading ""topics covered""","The Amazon review of this book includes a ""topics covered"" which lists, among other things, JDBC, JSP, servlets, etc., none of which are covered in this edition of the book! I am returning this book, which I had hoped to use as a guide for our web development team, but since it covers nothing more than the basics, contrary to what Amazon advertises, I will have to look for something more substantial elsewhere."
5,Best Java book I've seen,This book combines the clearest explanations with the most accurate and in-depth coverage of the topic. Even Java experts should probably read it at least once.If you're just learning Java you simply can't do better.
5,The Best technical reference I own,"I'm a software engineer and I obviously read and studied various books on diffirent programming languages. My biggest claim to fame is C Programming, but I thought about object orientation for a long time and that's how I came across ""Thinking in Java"".I Downloaded the book and even printed it and eventually bought a proper copy, because I was convinced it should be on my bookshelf. After reading the firts couple of chapters I have to admit that for the first time I really do understand object orientation through the clear and concise explanation backed up by good examples given on the subject.Any one interested in Java should defenately own this."
5,Oil heater,[[ASIN:B0006JNPFM HOWARD BERGER CO Deluxe Oil Filled Electric Radiator Heater] works great! Easy to clean and keeps cold spot in house very warm.
2,Little Toot DVD,I was disappointed. The picture was the same picture as the record and book we had in the 1940's. But the DVD and the story weren't at all the same. I was hoping to send the wonderful song and story to my great grandson but it is just not to be. Awful storyline and terrible music. I will try again to get the original.
2,Not the Best Shape Sorter,This is the cutest shape sorter I have seen so far but still didn't impress me. The shapes are hard to get in the holes unless it is exactly a certain way. I also like sorters with more than 5 shapes. I was able to find a Plan Toys one with 12.
2,too much emphasis on cookies!,"I was excited about getting this shape sorter because it's cute, has a lid, music, teaches shapes-- but no one mentioned how annoying this toy's emphasis on cookies is! I don't want my daughter's first words to be about how yummy cookies are, since she doesn't even eat them yet. yes, i know it's a ""cookie jar"" but i didn't realize the sounds that it makes is all about how the shapes are all of cookies and how yummy they are. it's a shame because the rest of the toy is pretty cute. Also, the shapes are somewhat difficult to fit in-- even for me!"
3,"Shapes hard to fit, music annoying...but baby loves it!","As a parent, I must say, the music is very annoying! There are two modes on the cookie jar (music and numbers). Each mode only has one song...which plays every time a cookie is put in the jar. Needless to say, the same song over and over can get VERY annoying for any adults within listening range! Definitely doesn't seem to bother my daughter, however, and that's all that matters. Some of the shapes are hard to fit in the jar, even for me. I know she can't put them in there. But she still has fun trying! Overall, it's a fairly fun toy...but there are better shape sorters out there, and certainly less annoying ones."
2,"fun, educational, durable ... but overall, TOO MUCH COOKIES","I agree with the other posters in that the concept behind this toy is great: shape sorting, with the added bonus of color and number recognition. And I'm not against light/sound toys that offer reward when the task is done (ie, singing when you get the right shape in place). BUT the shapes are hard for our 17 month old to push all the way in. And the movement-activated noises are very annoying. Any time you put your hand in the center, or on the shapes, you get sound reward -- ""yummy, cookies"" is one. Our child doesn't yet eat or ask for cookies, so that's unfortunate. (This was a gift, I probably wouldn't have bought it myself if I'd heard the messaging.) We're pretty happy with the wooden Melissa & Doug version of this, I'd recommend it instead."
4,Good for you and your couple!,Spiritual and practical approach to couple relationships. Inspiring for public in general and couple psychotherapists. The book met my expectations.
2,A disappointment,"The author of this book had a terrific idea, but the book disappoints because of its overwhelming emphasis on post-1980 movies. Manhattan locations for Hitchcock's North by Northwest, and The Godfather, among others are either left by the wayside or sorely underrepresented. Ghostbusters, on the other hand seems to pop up on each page."
5,View from Down Under,"A wonderful way of revisiting New York, even after living there for years. Came for a visit from Australia, and Manhattan on Film gave me a completely new and different perspective on the city that I thought I knew as well as the back of my hand. The book is written in an easy to read and engaging style. For any movie lovers and/or New York lovers, this is a book that you must read"
3,"okay, not her best",This one was suspenseful for a while... but I thought it lost steam near the end...
4,Happy with purchase,"If you haven't heard about Edgar Cayce, this book is a good, if brief, beginning. I first read this book in the mid 70s. The Sleeping Prophet introduced me to metaphysics as well as the remarkable healing work performed by Edgar Cayce."
2,not big elsewhere,barband like so many others.ok but that is all!!!this is a good bargain bin band.You could do worse.The songs are decent the playing is fine.This all has been done before and done better.
3,Some good information...,"A good story, told from an insider's point of view. However, that insider's point of view also eliminates a certain comprehensiveness that is important if the reader is looking for a thorough understanding of the fire and the events that led up to it. Any firefighter or EMS provider looking for a text to learn from will do better with Beverly Hills: The Anatomy of a Nightclub Fire, by Robert Lawson. Additionally, the edition I purchased of the Elliot book was very badly edited; this made it rather irritating to read."
5,Best Cat Toy Ever Created,This is well worth the money. Even the pickiest of cats will go wild over this.
1,"A Pro-Animal Rights Movie starring a Toothless, Declawed Bear.","If you didn't think it was possible to make a movie like this, you would be mistaken. Hunters and Loggers are portrayed as evil in a way that showed the filmmakers' ignorance of hunting, logging, and the outdoors in general. I guess they thought kids wouldn't notice. Mine did.The saddest part of this whole movie is the bear itself. It was obviously fed a poor diet and was overweight and sloppy. The majority of the bear's teeth were gone and it was de-clawed. One of the worst looking specimens of a black bear I have ever seen. I will say that seeing this bear was the closest I have come to crying during a movie in a long time.Overall, I would guess the piece was put out as a pro-greenie propaganda film, and it even does this poorly. Don't even get me started on the racist angle (a Native American doing a rain dance, I'm not kidding)."
3,"Great book, but dose have room for improvment.","Hello, my name is Nash Bean. I go to college here in Chattanooga TN. I am in C++ 1 now and we are useing your book. Reading your book is greate every thing flows smoothly, but useing you book as a refrance is all most impossible. It needs an appendix just for commands or keywords. This would help out greatly."
3,Junk food for the reader,"Not exactly great literature, but a quick read with lots of (repetitive) sex between two different male couples. It's two novellas, the first following Coloradan Jed and his new lover (""Hot Shots""), the second following Jed's brother Ross and his new lover at an Army base in North Carolina (""Ciphers."") Not much character development, but that might come in the sequels. Although the sex might be the main attraction, the personal stuff is more interesting, and Jed's story the better of the two since it includes some interaction with his mother, who is an interesting character, although not a major one. (Hopefully Ross will stop using the endearment ""Baby,"" which is annoying to a reader as well as to Kevin.)As with other Torquere books, the printing isn't first rate. Even thought there are 196 pages, the margins are very wide abd there are lots of chapters, meaning some pages are only a few sentences long. Plus the text is not fully justified."
5,superior battery,"I have owned this battery for several years, having bought it with my trv 27. It has always meet expectations and still does after years of use. this is yet another quality product from sony."
2,Crashing down the hill,"This book started out with a bang and slowly went down from there. Blaylock had a great idea, some wonderful characters, but just dropped the ball. He had a wonderful build but then didn't know what to do with the novel and just threw a few unrelated ideas together and ended the book. Because I've heard some good things about this author I'm willing to give him another try and just put this one down as a strikeout."
3,Perfect.,"Theofanidis's music is perfect in its form, harmony and melody. However, the music is a little too cliched and predictable at times. I can't wait to hear more from him."
3,Mixed,"The opening track ""Somewhere On Earth"" is impressive, but it starts to go downhill from there until track 11, ""People Of Cloud Nine"", which is even more impressive with her sophistocated vocaling and instrumentation. In fact, this track seems particularly uncharacteristic of the rest of the cd due to its quality nature. It blows the rest of the cd away, with the exception of the first track. Overall the cd is okay, but the tune ""I'm Only Human"" (not to be confused with the Human League song) is rather hoaky with the man and woman talking back and forth to each other."
5,Delicious Mix,"A soothing yet uplifting mix of African Beats, Synth pop, etherial vocals, & even some French Rap! Finding music to write to is difficult, but this is now one of my favorites. Especially haunting is ""The Way to Peace"", and ""Human Warmth in a cold city."" Gotta love the rap on ""Tous dans l'mme bateau."" I'm ready now to check out their other CD as well!"
5,A great soundtrack for living and working,"Uman was one of those groups I sampled on my wanderings around the ""New Age"" section of this site. I liked what I heard, and got the disk. And every time I play it, I like it even better. Depending on where I play it (car, phones, home) it displays different characters. I especially like playing it at work- it's one of the few discs that all my colleagues enjoy! Truly an eclectic sound. Get it!"
5,Terrific book of first-person first marathon stories,"Worth the price for the Grete chapter alone! This should be standard reading for anyone who loves running, or loves a runner! Explains a lot of the manias and ups and downs of your typical serial-marathoner. Lots of funny stories and inspiration, and a lot of good practical tips too. A must-have."
3,our enemy the state,"Nothing seems to have changed since Knock wrote this book. Reading it is a strange deja vu. Alas, the state is made by people.Professor E. G. Harteveld, Rasquert University, Netherlandswww.erikharteveld.nl"
1,More neoconservative blather,Who knew these extremists existed back then? The author claims the state is the enemy and free markets are your freind. Maybe he didnt see AIG coming. Or Wall Street robbing us blind while the states hands were tied by these free market zealots. The state is the people and the author is simply stating you cant trust people...(unless theyre a for profit person).
5,"Eye of the Beholder, by Jeff Pate","Thanks Jeff, for another fast-paced, Clark Hager thriller! An entertaining fast read. Clark Hager reveals himself as much more than a police detective to his readers in this book. He gives us insight into what makes him tick as a father, a lover, a friend and dedicated investigator. Jeff Pate continues to mature as a novelist. I understand there's another Hager case brewing. I look forward to the release of BOILING POINT"
4,Great product for PROBLEM BARKERS,"I purchased this product for a terrier-schnauzer mix (male) who is a great dog, he just barks way too much and once he gets started he will not stop. From day 1 this collar limited his barking to almost nothing! I follow the instructions and remove it for part of the day. I was also able to turn down the adjustable power of the shock to the lower settings after the first day. Easy to use, instructions are complete and informative. Plastic collar easy to keep clean."
4,a good summary,"I purchased this book for the upcoming Washington State GOP convention. I was completely out of the know at our local county convention, and this book gave me an excellent run down of what the heck happened (and how certain things happened). This book is recommended for those new to public meetings."
2,"""In Brief"" and he means it","I would not reccomend this book, simply because it really gives hardly any information. It just goes over the surface andleaves you wondering what he was talking about. If you're looking for a good book on ""Robert's Rules"" please getThe Idiot's Guide to Robert's Rules. It is 10X better. I have 2 more books I purchased on this subject so when I read themI will let you know what I think."
4,Exactly as promised,Exactly what I needed and as promised. This is a great introduction to Robert's Rules of Order. After reading it I was comfortable running a meeting not just attending!
5,Simple and straightforward,"For those who are overwhelmed by the density of Robert's, this small book may be the answer. Every serious parliamentarian needs a copy of the complete Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, but you would have to have a real train wreck to need more than this brief outline to keep things running smoothly."
3,Robert's Rules of Order,Very easy to understand and recommend for anyone involved in conducting or participating in meetings.
5,A must have!,"If you have a mother-in-law , a wife , or husband , or a family , you need to place this book on the kitchen table when you sit down. The look you will get , is worth the cost of the book , and the results, well , they speek for themselves."
4,Guide to an orginized geathering,"Our city has adopted this platform to conduct it's Council Meetings, if only they would re-read it for the book is a great guide Thanks"
3,awesome delivery,"Having trouble getting into this book. I don't know if maybe I should have sstarted with something easier or what, however I'm not giving up just yet."
3,Reads like someone's personal notes,"This is a book on an interesting (if narrow) topic. Some of the recipes at the end were quite good but on the whole I was a bit unsatisfied with this book. I felt the author just brought together all of her personal knowledge on Swedish(-American?) Christmas and did very little research into how other Swedes (in the US, Sweden or elsewhere in the world) celebrate this most important occasion. You would probably do better to copy and paste bits of information here and there from the internet than to buy this book. It is not a bad book but it is thin and does not seem well researched."
4,A good French collection of Mireille Mathieu songs.,"So what keeps this CD from getting five stars? It has 18 well performed songs, but few outstanding ones. As a fan, you expect the exceptional from Ms. Mathieu and often she delivers it. In this CD most of the songs are available on other CD collections. The exceptions (""Un clown dans mon coeur"" aka ""What Kind of Fool Am I?"", ""A dix-sept ans"" aka ""At Seventeen"", ""Encore et encore"", and ""Un prince en Avignon"") did not impress me, except for ""A Santa Maria"". It is a catchy and interesting song, but more of a guilty pleasure than a great song. However, Mireille is still Mireille, so there is merit in her singing most of these songs."
4,A Rare Surprise,"I downloaded this book free on my Kindle thinking it would be a work about the Apostle Peter. It turned out to be a very interesting novel about a young British pastor who became a chaplain during World War I. Rather than dealing with interactions between the chaplain and combat soldiers, the novel goes into the young chaplain's struggles with his faith and the temptations he faces while being stationed in France.It was a bit difficult for me to follow at times due to the heavy use of early 20th centure British slang. This Kindle lookup feature was very helpful."
5,A thorougly warm reading experience.,"One of the most interesting and well developed characters in modern fiction. You needn't have anything in common with her or her family to like them, and know they ring true. Ms. Schumacher has a wit matched only by Nelson Demille in ""The Gold Coast"". This type of author does not write often enough."
2,Average read - very disappointing ending,"I read this book thinking it would be a great story. First of all, Jane's character is just not likeable - especially considering her lack of feelings for her unborn child. She seemed to have no real purpose and was boring. Bee was interesting you could say, but she wasn't any more likeable. What was with the Dad coming into Jane's room and telling her lies? I did not grasp that at all. The only characters I found somewhat interesting were the Dad and Mr. Denzer. This book started off okay for me, but quickly got boring and seemed to have no purpose. The ending was so awful that I just laughed. It would have been nice to know if Jane had ever bonded with her baby, or what she had done with it. Oh well, just my opinion. I think the story had potential, but was just kind of washed out."
4,A great tool for the new Bible reader,"As a new Bible reader and studier, I have found this book to be very worthwhile for getting an overview of Biblical material. It is easy to get lost while reading a book of the Bible (for us newbies, anyway!), and Sailhamer's book shows the reader the Big Picture so that it is easy to keep on track. There are more in-depth commentaries, but if you are new at this, I recommend this book. I gave it four stars because I think it could be a BIT more detailed."
5,Incredibly Helpful,"This is a wonderful resource for both the beginning bible reader and the Hebrew scholar. Dr. Sailhamer helps you follow the meaning of the text of Scripture. It is presented in a very clear, readable manner.I have had the book for years and reference it all the time. I continue to buy more copies to give away as gifts."
5,Not that they need my recommendation...,"...but Selah is SO GREAT!!! I can hardly wait for their next cd(May 25 - mark your calenders!) and their solo CDs (sometime this fall)! They are talented, unique, and undefinable by current Christian genres. I HIGHLY recommend this (and all their) CDs!"
3,"Great camera, but overexposes a lot in automatic mode","Nikon D80 is my first Digital SLR(In fact, first serious camera I bought), my previous camera was canon SD1000 point and shoot. Overall I am pleased with the picture quality. But I don't like the fact that Nikon D80 overexposes photos a lot in automatic mode. Many of the photos I took in bright sunlight is washed out. After reading and experimenting a lot, I learned to take pictures in manual model, with different metering(SPOT and CENTER WEIGHTED) to avoid this issue. But after spending about 1299 $, I don't like the performance of the camera in automatic mode at all. I hope Nikon will release a firmware update to fix the metering. If you are a novice DSLR person like me, and is considering buying a system, I suggest you go with Canon EOS 40D, I haven't used it, but after researching a lot online, I haven't come across major issues with EOS 40D. Experts can correct me if I am wrong."
2,major unreported issue,Great camera except that it has a tendency to lock up and not record the pictures taken. Tried multiple different memory cards with the same result. Finally tried to upgrade the firmware with the result that the camera completely died and is now useless. As my warranty has expired it will probably cost me several hundred dollars to get fixed. In contacting Nikon the refused to even reply with a solution as my residence was listed as others. In short avoid Nikon if you ever expect to need support as their main concern will be to turn you away to avoid responsibility.
4,good camera,"I bought this camera in 2006 at much higher price, but I am satisfied with it as I took a lot of pictures in the past 2 years.I recommend users to have a better lens instead of the default lens 18-135 f/3.5~. the picture should be sharp, and you will find the difference easily."
4,D80 - great camera,"I'm using it at my dental office for clinical use, I changed the lense to 105mm Macro with Ring- Flash!It's a great camera for me."
4,"New to digital, very happy","This camera arrived and I was amazed at how friendly it is. Previously I shot film with a Nikon N70 as a serious amateur occasionally making some money with it. All I had to do was charge the battery, easily set the time and date and it was ready to go. The controls for even the more complicated features are very intuitive if you just spend a little time glancing through the manual. Because it's winter in Minnesota, I haven't had any time yet to use it outside but the shots I've taken with just the on camera flash have came out well. I'm still not sure what I'm going to use for an everyday lens for this camera but in the meantime, my AF 35 to 80 lens from my N70 works very well. The 2gb card that I bought for it has plenty of capacity even if I shoot in RAW. I still have plenty to learn especially about some of the on-camera editing features but everything has been so easy to learn so far so I expect that to come quickly as well."
2,DX lenses 18-135mm focusing problems,"I have used the D80 camera with the 18-135 lens kit that was a package when I bought it in Dec 2006. Not even 3 years and the lenses has malfunctioned. I was on vaction in Yellowstone and the camera does not focus anymore, so I ended up doing manual focusing. I knew it is the lens because I have 2 other G lenses from my old N65 and the camera focuses well when using the old lenses. Nikon only has a 1 year warranty on this. Otherwise, before the lenses broke it was a great camera. Nikon has very poor customer support."
2,Serious focusing problems,"Before you buy this camera, Google ""D80 autofocus problems"". This camera has major autofocus problems and lots of people are experiencing it. My next door neighbor has this camera as well and she's having the same problem. I love all the bells and whistles on the camera and all the different options, but my Kodak Easy Share takes better pictures.I had a Nikon N70 before I bought the D80 and I loved it. Based on this experience, I will probably never buy a Nikon again."
1,Full of inaccuracies.,"There are some interesting technical details in this book, which might make it worth reading for a Titanic enthusiast.There are numerous contradictions in the book to known established facts. Stokers assaulting people with shovels for a place in the boats? Attempted stabbing of the radio operator for a life belt? Male passengers being shot? The bridge phone not being answered for minutes? Collapsible boats disintegrating immediately?I'm a good portion through this book, and I'm doubtful it's worth more of my time. It's an old book written in a different time, the price is right, but this is fiction."
4,Cute movie,"This movie is almost Parent Trap-esque with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen playing two different girls, yet it also has definite overtones of the Prince and the Pauper. As you can expect with Olsen Twin movies (especially the ones made before their teen years) this is a sweet, happy, and very kid-appropriate film."
4,This book is rare treasure...,"What fun when I find a book that captivates your attention, feeds your soul, and makes you laugh all at the same time. I love to read a great book and know there are more by the same author to savor and look forward to. The short story format makes for short get-aways during my day to sit and gain perspective and remind myself just what is most important in life. This book and others by the same author are treasures I'm so glad I found. They make wonderful gifts too!!!"
3,Heat Shield,"Wish I could of used it under my chrome heat shields or my black heat shields, have to take a lot of stuff off in order to put on, almost takes 2 people to get it done right, probably my engine is not tuned as well as I would have liked it. Kind of a waste of time to go through all of the trouble required on a bagger type bike."
4,Training Pads,"Great money saver! I highly recommend for any small dog training. My puppies were very fussy - would not use a pad more than once. These are smaller than standard pads in store and are much less expensive. They are not as thick as ""puppy wee-wee pads"" but certainly do the trick just fine!"
2,does not absorb,Does not absorb right away. If not in middle pee runs to edge and off pad. Other pads absorb right away as soon as pee hits pad.
1,Extremely poor quality.,"I just received this item that I ordered last week. After pulling it out of the box I found the surface of the ""mirror"" to be all scratched up...even had it not been scratched you couldn't get a clear reflection. It was more like looking in to a cheap silver paper plate. To top it off, the company expects me to return it at my expense and refund me only for the purchase price of the product. I will have paid as much in shipping and handling as it cost to buy the ""mirror"". Extremely disappointed in the product and even more so with the poor level of customer service/quality control of the company. I can't believe Amazon.com has partnered with such a sad company."
4,Mindless Fun Entertainment,The first step to take to enjoy this movie is to realize that it is meant to be a silly light hearted comedy. If you can't allow yourself to let go of the details you can't watch this movie.Amanda Byrnes plays Viola a soccer loving teen. Viola's soccer team is cut and she is not allowed to try out for the boys team. When Viola learns that her brother Sebastian is ditching school for a few weeks Viola decides to become him so she can prove she can play on the boys team.Of course all sorts of wackiness ensues as Viola tries to act like a boy. There are romantic triangles and fun soccer scenes. This is a great silly teen movie. Enjoy it with a some popcorn and soda and be ready to laugh at the silliness.
5,EXCELLENT Movie!!!!!,"I had intended on seeing this movie when it hit theateres, but I never got around to it. So the other day, I was in the store, and decided to pick up a copy. That night when I got home and watched it, I was plesantly surprised! This is one of my favorite movies! The jokes are funny, the plot is good, and the whole movie is just well written. The cast really knew how to make a dull line funny. So, even if you have never seen this movie before, go buy it, because it is money well spent! Trust me on this one!"
3,Fun teen movie but has bad acting,I wanted to see this movie right away from the funny previews. The film was good but it's not a great film. The story is sweet and funny but the acting is not the greatest. The film is a fun teen film.
5,very pleased,My daughter really wanted this movie for Christmas and I couldnt find it in any of the stores. Thank you Amazon for getting it here by Christmas and for a great price!!
5,Ridiculous and funny,"Fun, silly movie. I laughed out loud many times and thought it odd I was enjoying this so much. Must have been in a great mood but watching this made for good times."
3,An ok movie...,"Typical chick flick themes. However, the one element which this movie is really about is not bad.Movie is about a girl who loves soccer. Her school has just cut the woman's soccer team and she asks to be tried out for the boy's team. When the coach refuses, she dresses up as her brother and joins another school, hoping to make the soccer team and show everyone that girls can play just as well as boys.Ok acting. An ok plot. Funny at times. The lesson it attempts to teach is not incredibly profound, but its good.Good if you like chick flick type movies. Not great, but good to watch."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Devil's Bride was good, this was not. It began promising-- I love the stories of young girls loving a man from afar and him finally realizing she has grown up. However, after the first few chapters, it went flying downhill. The mysery was interesting enough, but much too much attention was given to that and not developing the romance and characters. I kept plodding on, telling myself that it will get better soon. At pg 137, I finally gave up. It was too boring for words! I skipped over 100 pages and started skimming through the rest--which didn't seem much better. I can't believe I paid for this. I am kicking myself. Laurens has proven herself as a good writer, but this one missed the mark by a LOT. If you love her, then I guess you should try it, but there are many other more worthwhile books to consume a few hours."
2,Waste of time and money,"Having read the series in order I was really looking forward to this book, boy was I disappointed!!!!! I plowed through about three quarters of the book before finally giving up on it. The H&H were such idiots that I felt they deserved each other. I really hate when the main characters go from doing, or saying, one stupid thing after another. I gave it two stars only because I was okay with the story line in the beginning and it could have worked. There were also so many conflicting statements in the book (the heroine was so well known in the area she had lived in for 13 years and yet at a local dance she didn't know anyone around her age). I'm now starting on the next book in the series but I am starting it with the feeling, having read the first chapter, that it's not going to be much better. I really hope I'm wrong about that."
3,A disappointment,"Afer SCANDAL'S BRIDE, my favorite in this series, I expected a more sophisticated story, but we're back to humphing and hmmmming and one too many ""Indeeds"". The plot was fairly well laid out, but Demon and Flick were cardboard cut-outs, and way, way too much was made of their age difference. After a while, even I was beginning to think of Demon as a dirty old man. And where the heck were the other Cynsters that so entertainingy populated the first three books? Take a breath, Stephanie, we'll wait for you."
3,Sparse on pre-1900 History,"Although there is a chapter dedicated to the subject, my other research indicates this is rather light on detailed 19th Century history in Southern Alabama...which is what I'm looking for. It's probably a good book for an overview, but it didn't meet my needs. The most helpful part was the bibliography, from which I will begin anew."
4,"very good series but beware, with no finale.","very good drama, very good efects, very good suspense but en the last chapter the final became so rapid, so easy because the producers decide end the series. so the last chapter became with a final 5 minutes after ending in the form of a child who tell the threshold's director the human win at last and she (the director) will no see it.please respect the customer ending with dignity a series with so many good things.thank you very much"
2,"Good story idea, bad writing and acting","I just bought this on a whim because I am a Brent Spiner fan and thought it can not be that bad. Boy was I ever wrong. The story is great, the acting and writing are cheesy at best. No wonder it was canceled. The lines that try to be funny fall way short and the lead (Carla Gugino) is not believable at all. She is suppose to be this genius that is the best in the world at crisis management. I find it hard to believe she could even manage a seven eleven much less this job. If they had done better casting and better writing this might have taken off. You can tell they spent a good bit on sets and effects, but I think they should have spent more in other areas and the show might have gone somewhere. Take my advice and save your money. If you must see this then rent it."
4,Left wanting more,"Too bad that this show was cut down in its prime by short-sighted and bottom-line oriented TV executives, and neglected by unimaginative TV viewers. I enjoyed it even more on DVD, and really dug the unaired episodes, especially the final one, ""Alienville."" This was a program that was adeptly cast, with very good acting, interestingly told (well written), and even decent SFX on a TV budget and schedule. The extra features on disc 4 were pretty cool too, especially the one that covered future plot developments had the show continued. With a noticeable scarcity of good sci fi on TV these days (Stars Trek and Gate both gone or going, etc.), it hurts even more that Threshold was never given the chance it deserved."
3,good sci-fi,This is a well made sci-fi drama. I enjoyed both the characters and the premise of the shows. It's a shame that the series did not run longer.
3,On the Threshold,"""Threshold"" was a fascinating series. For a brief time, it enjoyed its reign on CBS as a primetime drama following in the footsteps of the phenomenally successful X-Files. Like the X-Files,it had an alien invasion scenario. Carla Gugino channels Dana Scully as a skeptical investigator of paranormal events. She has former Data Brent Spiner on her side as well as the diminutive Peter Dinklage.The series began with an alien craft crash-landing into the Atlantic. Some people nearby die,others develop superhuman abilities. Gugino and her team go to investigate. There are nightmarish, dreamlike scenes such as the ""trees made of glass."" Gugino is a talented actress; unfortunately,Threshold isn't the only prematurely cancelled show she's starred in.""Threshold"" ended before its time,with too many unresolved cliffhangers."
3,Don't let this be the only Tepper book you read,"A charming story, lost in a spectacular overlay of polemic. Tepper's work is always drenched in her liberal (not *just* feminist) political and spritual values, but usually this does not hurt her stories, and often it augments them (the feminist thought exercise that laid the foundation for _Sideshow_ inspired one of the best first chapters I have ever read). Not so, in _The Fresco_ - a promising beginning is soon overwhelmed by an ongoing rant that stunts the story before it has a chance to mature. I don't think it's just because this story veers into political territory that I can't agree with (which it does) - Tepper's _The Family Tree_ remains one of my favorite novels, although I am appalled by its subtext of environmental extremism. My favorite aspect of Tepper's writing is her creativity and ability to describe mindblowing otherness, and in that arena this flight of fantasy never gets off the ground."
2,Suitable for Backpackers,"The title is unsuitable. There is nothing 'ultimate' about this package, which seems to target a low budget, backpacking type of audience. The attractions are slanted in favor of what you might call 'hippie' interests. I am left with a lot of questions and a strong feeling of disillusionment. Most of the activities can be done practically anywhere, and there is little focus on unique local entertainment, gifts or dining beyond what you find in somebody's cabin out in the boonies. I'm a middle aged boomer with an interest in comfort - not camping - and a memorable travel experience with shows and food and special gifts, and want to believe the region has something to offer my market, so I will look for more current information. That said, if I was a teenager looking for an affordable adventure, this video would be a good place to start."
1,a very bad mistake,"ski&rescue; suit,i had to ship this garbage and cost $9.80 usd plus the cost of shippingi lost about $15.00 usd.this thing was made for a old man with big belly and very short legs and long bodythis kind don`t exist,you have to be rescue from once you put it on"
1,Just Not There Anymore,"I admit it, im 17 and when i was younger Bow Wow was the best thing to hit music, it made all the KIDS feel good, but now he's 18 and truthfully he's just not workin hard enuff to compete with otha rappers in his age group...for example, LLoyd Banks only 20, he's killin Bow easily, people like Jody Breeze, only 19, killin him....Bow made good music for the kids and it seems that thats the only audience he can attract...its time to grow up..once again im not hatin, but i rap also and i know a hell of alot about rap and this cd just didnt sound good...good try Bow...bring it hood next time!!! 1"
2,Bow Wow is a Trip,"I'm not sure what to think because Bow Wow is the biggest laugh in hip-hop right now. He is trying to convert from lolipop and milk duds rap to the streets and hos. Why is he still hanging out with J.D.? Listen to ""Fresh Azimiz"" this song will make you laugh until you die from blood loss. ""18 Nigga, making more then your dad""? What is this guy beefing with 12 year olds over the last piece of bumble gum? Why is Ciera hanging out with Beaver Cleaver and why would any girls over the age of 16 think this guy is fly? Homeboy is the black Dawson Creek, get this out of you CD player or IPod or whatever the hell you all have. Stop requesting his songs and get into some real hip-hop. The south has been breeding to many bitches lately."
2,Damn cuzo u could've been worst.,"A people out there who thank that this CD is ok or mediocre, you are wrong. Because T.I. wrote most of that s**t on this CD, all you got to do is look on the CD cover and look at the song written by and it will say C. Harris (Clifford Harris Jr. AKA T.I). So T.I really make all ya'll new bow wow fans. So when Bow was in the Source talking all crazy talkin bout he on the same level wit Weezy F, dat nigga sick cuz he didn't even write none of those punchlines."
1,What a Disaster,I feel sorry for the little guy there are no good songs on this disc at all that are even Okay and he tries much hard to rap.Lil Bow Wow is a cool dude but rapping should not be his career field because he has little to no actuall talent
2,not the same Bow Wow,"I wouldn't recommend this for the younger crowd like his previous albums. Bow Wow is now 18 and now cussing in his music. I've heard ""N!&&@"" at least 12 times on this record. Just Like Queen Latifah's 1993 album ""Black Reign"", this album should have came with a ""Parental Advisory"" label (That Queen Latifah album had a lot of cussing as well). Thankfully, ""N!^&&@"" is the only cuss word on this album. This album is not as suitiable for his younger fans as his previous albums were."
1,Poser,"Bow wow is a straight up clown.Cause if he just stuck to makin party beats like he would, people wouldn't be makin badd commentslike me and others. Hes trying to be a fake thug cause he keep saying for example oh u shut suckaz down when you come on the block.then he cursed like 15 times on 4 or 3 tracks. Most of itwas the n word.any girl whos in love witt this clown is a slut.I hope ciara finds a real man. Bow wow never lived a thug lifehe was rich like at 11 and most of his childhood, plus his momworked like 3 jobs and he basically got ev'ry thing he wanted.When most kids who was his age where hustling he was living made.Thats what most rappers want and he had all of it. So he dosen't need to be a poser thug.If you want real hip hop with artistwho really where thugs and tell the truth here they are.2pac-All eyes on meAny Eminem albumAny 50 Cent AlbumBiggie- Ready to dieDr Dre-The chronic and chronic 2001DMX-Great deppressionDMX-Grand ChampDMX-It's dark and hell its hot1"
5,I love this album,This album is not wack like all the others say! All the songs talk about him being mature and I respect that becuase when anybody turns 18 they would want to express themselves. Everybody is talkin about how this album is wack but its not! I understand where he is coming from because my brother turned 18 and he colud not stop talkin about it! When he comes out with another album everybody is going to be sayin how wack it is but they all know that they like it. If you got a problem with Bow wow's music stop buyin his records and stop listening to his music on the computer. That could fix your problem.
4,Bow Wow's legacy contines...An it still lives on!!!,"On Bow Wow's 4th album Wanted, this time they do it bigger, andbadder than his last album Unleashed. On his 4th album Wanted, Bow Wow contines to tried rap about some girls my favorite songs on this album are ""Let Me Hold You"" ""Big Dreams"" and ""Is That You (P.Y.T)"
4,Polsby at his best,"""How Congress Evolves"" is elegantly written, cogently argued, and politically astute. Nelson Polsby gives his readers the benefit of four decades and more of immersion in and observation of Congress, along with his penetrating insights into politics, people, and institutions, and a writing style that is at once accessible and sophisticated. Novices and experts, students and practitioners, scholars and journalists, all will learn immensely about how the House of Representatives works and how it changes.""--Norman Ornstein, American Enterprise Institute"

2,So-so,"It's like what it says on the title. A dictionary. It's not what I call a definitive source, but it's ok."
1,Blood Brothers,This book was purchased for a summer school class for my daughter. It is not a book that either of us would check out of the library for reading.
4,Blood Brothers,"This excellent book was an eye-opener for me - having been taught through the church that Israel was returning to the Promised Land and that it was their right to be there. Elias Chacour is a man of extraordinary faith and love. I enjoyed his latest book ""Faith Beyond Despair"" even more - it being written over 20 years later. Important reading."
1,CHEAP TOOL....,"I have brought several link removers from this seller and have been very disappointed. All this pins have broke. This is the worst one yet! My husband collects watches and loves tool gagets. Next time, I will buy a quality tool and will pay a little more for a better made link remover."
3,cute little grill pan!,"I love Le Creuset; the little grill pan, as long as you don't get the heat too high, does grilled sandwiches, small meat servings, panini, etc. The challenges: it needs to be seasoned regularly, it's heavy, as all LC pans are, and if it is dropped in the sink it will definitely chip the surface of the sink. This is not the frying pan to hit your husband over the head with when making a point. It may kill him! 8^)"
1,Two units DOA,"I purchased a unit, it was non-functional (after loading, message said ""no-disk""). I have returned it, received another one - defective as well."
5,Great size!,"This was the perfect size, I ordered the large and had to send it back because it was too big."
2,Beware of non-universal keyboard layout !,"Toshiba has changed the universally used key sizes and/or locations of several of the keys on their 17"" laptop keyboards (ie: shift . / ; ' up arrow). Also added a 2nd forward slash key. I would not have bought this laptop had I known about this."
2,But can you find a replacement belt?,"I have a nearly identical turntable. Yes the sound is great, yes this is a good price on the surface, but after several years of use the belt broke that drives the platter. I can't find a replacement anywhere! So, cough up the extra dough and buy a direct drive. With fewer parts to break and more support from the DJ community the direct drive is the way to go."
1,"OK product, crappy seller","I received my turntable in, what I thought, perfect condition. ""Super Saver Shipping"" is actually USP ground from NY, which takes all of eternity and then some, to arrive in CA.The turntable itself looks sturdy, but I haven't been able to test anything else, as the needle it came with was BROKEN. Which now means I have to buy a $21 dollar replacement. Or wait through the living hell of returning the item to J&R;, a seller that doesn't accept normal e-mail returns.Amazon should really look into who sells on their website."
1,"""It's good,but...""","I've owned two of these; the 2d,thru Amazon.The thing keeping the SLBD20D from achieving regulance is: Its tonearm's soulnuking habit of backtracking a 45r/m record's leadin groove and thus mathitting. That damn slidecontrol cueing is the reason, I think-it enables the tonearm to,I strongly feel/believe,disconcertingly ""have a mind of its own"". There's one/ONLY one,33r/m record that's happened to,w/my 2d SLBD20D:An original(1970)copy of ""Funkadelic"". Technics hella needs to abandon making the LAST LIVING T4P turntable w/slidecontrols,period.It's just played out.Oh,& by the way,Technics:no damn BUTTONS,either,or I'ma HIT SOME SERIOUS ROOF."
3,"solid turntable , but no built-in pre-amp","This is a great basic turntable if you're just looking to play the old LPs, however, be warned that if you plan on hooking this up to a mini-stereo system without phono jacks, then you'll need to purchase a seperate pre-amp which runs around [dollar amount]. This brings the total cost of the unit to about [dollar amount] which is not worth it if you're just a casual user of LPs (plus this is only a semi-automatic). You'd be better off purchasing a cheaper system (e.g. the sony) with a built-in pre-amp so that it can connect to mini-systems."
3,"Guess it's just ""ok""....","I guess this little clock is ok for the price. I like that it has the temperature and humidity, along with having an alarm. It uses 2 ""specialty"" batteries that are included (not AA's, which is a drawback in my book). The battery compartment is a total nuisance to open and close with 4 tiny screws that are easily stripped. Hopefully, the batteries won't have to be replaced too often. I actually bought this for the alarm clock function, but just tested the alarm only to find it is VERY faint. I hope it wakes me up!"
3,Maybe I'm naive or misinformed....,But you should make it clear that it doesn't work without the case or however it is called. Same goes for the other leap pad.
5,This is the type of book that soothes me . . .,"I have long been a devotee of slowly unfolding novels set in remote locations of Ireland, Scotland and England. This is one of the best, comparable to Mary Stewart, Jean Stubbs, Rosamunde Pilcher or the late Dorothy McArdle. Raife's character development is as good as Maeve Binchy's. This is a book that soothed me. I write for a living and so am extremely particular."
4,"Quick, easy and good taste",This bean mix was simple to use and the taste was very good. I would buy them again
3,Comprehensive curriculum Grade 1,"This is certainly not a comprehensive curriculum, but is great as a supplement. I was particularly unhappy with the phonics section. You will for sure need more practice for phonics. I and my son loved their kindergarten curriculum, which seemed more ""comprehensive"" to me."
5,Hilarious,I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and it never gets old. The way Mellisa Joan Heart and Joey Lawrence act like an old married couple and then fall in love as well as all the sappy regular family stuff thrown in with goons chasing them makes this a great romantic comedy. A little predictable but still lovable.
2,Not a family movie,I was glad that my husband and I watched this on our own without our kids. There was some bad language and lots of talk about sex. Plus they were so mean to each other. Not a feel good movie.
4,Entertaining and fast paced comedy,I was finally able to get a reasonably clear version of this movie to properly evaluate it. You may not be so lucky.This movie turns out to be very entertaining and amusing. The comedy is part wit and part slapstick. The entire cast is quite good. Bardot is simply adorable as the teenage daughter of a nightclub owner. She may look like a goddess but Bardot is very earthly in her ways. She is not so much naughty in this picture as she is accident prone and inept at virtually anything she attempts. Her sensuality is quite apparent but still developing at this early stage of her career.I don't believe there is a digitally restored version of this movie. One of the production companies should do it as done with other Bardot movies. This movie then can really be enjoyed.
3,"Listenable, but a major disappointment","Nothing really happens on this album- the compositions are listless, overstretched, and mostly derivative of Frisell's earlier, better works. It combines elements from Nashville and Gone, Just like a Train, but doesn't have any of these wonderful recordings' energy or innovation. Practically all of the static, ""folksy"" songs on Good Dog sound almost exactly the same, and Frisell's playing is never really on the mark. Wayne Horvitz is also almost TOTALLY wasted on this album... he supplies only a bit of subtle organ backround. I wouldn't recommend it to Frisell fans or newcomers, but if you think some of his earlier work is too ""experimental,"" then maybe this is tame enough for you."
3,Not really a remake,"If you've never seen the original, than you'll probably love this movie. It fun, gory, your typical horror film fare. As a remake the movie is horrible. Character are missing. Scenes are missing and the freaky grandpa is missing."
1,Pointless Remake,"What were they thinking in Hollywood when the decision was made to remake Tobe Hooper's original film. The film is more an exercise in revisionism and symbolic of the lack of originality that plaques Hollywood today. I found the film to be pointless much like the remake of Alfred Hitchock's Psycho. It's rare when the original film can improved upon via a remake. This film is a reason why not to remake classic horror films. Don't bother with this one folks, not worth your time nor money."
1,No Not Again!,"When will people learn to stop remaking already good movies like Psycho, Hills Have Eyes, and Amityville Horror. TCM remake is just a retarted and dumbed down version of the original get the real Texas chainsaw massacre if you wan't a good horror flick."
3,"Not bad, but I recommend ""Wrong Turn"" over this.","Remakes of classic horror are almost never needed. However it seems these days Hollywood has run out of ideas for new horror. For instance there have been a # of horror films re-done in the past couple of years.. ""Dawn of the Dead"" & ""Psycho"" just to name a few. Has any of these remakes surpassed the originals? No. This film is no exception. I think alot of young film directors just wanna shot at remaking the film(s) they loved at a younger age. And I guess there isn't anything wrong with that. I recommend you see the originals over (or atleast before) the remakes. It's important to see why these films were inspirational enough to be remade in the first place. I guess you know what the next classic horror remake is going to be? It's ""The Exorcist"" of course."
5,dvd Special Editions,"Like I Said Before, Checked the features of a film like this one. because is better than the regular dvd edition also it gots some information when never heard or seen in the film.don't make me no enemy ppl.because im not,im a movie collector. and someday somehow someway i will be waiting to purchase a third sequel,if New Line ever decides to make another."
4,Remake,This was a good movie to start with. It's hard to believe this really happened.Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It's a classic. But the remake seems more fictional than the first the actual events seems lost in Hollywood writing. Watch the first one for the plot. Watch this one for the effects.
2,Untitled. Film is not worth a title,"You know there's a problem when you root for the bad guys in a movie like this. I was actually cheering on leatherface when he caught them and made the kills. I didn't like any of the 20somethings. They seemed superficial and expendable. As for the actual movie itself, the original is so much more realistic and gory. This was a poor re-make."
2,TCM 90210... why?,"The extremely macabre and seedy atmosphere, the realistic acting, and the documentary-style directing of the original 1974 The Texas Chain Saw Massacre were the attributes that made it so potently disturbing, and a true work of art. The remake lacks what made the original a classic, and in comparison is only mildly disturbing. This is Slicked-up Hollywood Bland-style 90210 Massacre. Although, this is better than Chainsaw 2 for creepy atmoshpere."
3,A great new look for the classic,"I definitely enjoyed this movie as much as the original. It defitely had a faster pace and did do a good job remaking the original, but sill adding enough differences to keep the movie interesting. I actually like the ending on this one a little better than the first."
3,Leave the classics alone.,"As far as horror movies go, this one isn't that bad. However, as far as remakes go, leave the classics alone. Some movies aren't meant to be remade, and this is one of them. It barely has anything in common with the original except for LEATHERFACE. I did like the ending better than the original, and overall, i would recommend renting this movie for horror fans."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time/Monry,This movie is so bad that it made me get on Amazon and write my first review to warn others to never watch this movie. It's that bad! The acting is horrible and the casting is even worse.Do yourself a favor and see the original. This teenie-pop version is so bad that words cannot describe.
2,"Compared to the original, this is just another horror movie","As horror movies go this isn't a terribly bad one. I was surprised after seeing it that I liked it much more than I thought I would. I admit that I even liked a few of the story changes that were made in contrast to the original. As many others have said, this movie is very brutal, not just in its imagery (which often reminds me of scenes from ""Seven""), but in its general philosophy it is grim, hopeless, cruel.However, when compared to the original they are just on different levels artistically. This is just a movie in that it FEELS like *just* a movie. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre felt like reality in its gritty and almost amateurish appearance and simple plot. This movie in its crispness and special effects feels like just that, a movie and nothing more, you know what you see isn't real because you have seen it over and over in so many other films. This type of movie making is within a framework that stays safely on the screen."
3,Classic remake falls flat,"I'm a huge fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and this remake doesn't do it justice.I consider the original film my favorite horror movie ever, so I might be a little biased. The original movie was all about the physiological horror as the movie unfolds, but the remake is all about gore. The original isn't overly gory in my opinion, but yet is far more scarier than this bloody remake. Focusing on the gore really lessens this movie to a typical horror flick, which isn't bad, but it is what the movie was meant to represent.On the plus side, there are some wonderful new perspectives added to old scenes. Some of the changes hit right on the mark by reinventing the movie and not just rehashing the original.Still, the remake falls far under the original movie, proving just to be an average horror/slasher film."
4,magnificent DVD,"Is this a great movie??? No, but it is not as bad as other people make it out to be. It has it's moments, but its not as good as the first movie done in 1974. I only hope that long time fans quit comparing this movie to the one done almost 30 years ago. People need to quit living in the past and recognize this movie for what it is: a good horror flick.Give credit to New Line Cinema for putting this dvd out. This is one of the best dvd's released so far this year in my opinion. The sound, picture and extras are wonderful. I can't help but gush when playing this on my home theater system. New line cinema is the standard of excellence when producing dvd's."
3,FUn,Ok so the movie is just good old fashioned fun :-) not like the orginal although there are some nods to itjust think of it as a What If kinda thing ;-)
4,excellent solution,"An excellent solution to utilizing narrow space next to the washer/dryer. However, not as sturdy as it could be; it does tend to wobble when rolled."
4,Let's get started,"I first bought this kit when I first got into model railroading. I knew that I didn't know much about how to do the whole 'scenic-ing' stuff.This is a great tool to practice some very vital elements to modeling. The directions take you through a step-by-step process.From weathering rocks, to building trees to laying ballast and track, this diorama gets you quickly into modeling--and through the learning curve quickly.This scene now holds an engine to display.This is a great place to get your feet wet."
5,A must for Beefheart fanatics.,"This box set is BOOTLEG QUALITY, but the music and liner notes are FIRST RATE. The video footage is priceless! This package was made with tender loving care by Beefheart fanatics, and it shows. If you love Beefheart, grab it before it goes out of print! The instrumental ""Trout Mask"" rehearsals are worth the price of admission alone....burn them to a CD-R (without the in-between song banter) and you're in Trout Mask Heaven!"
2,Very Disappointing,"A Rarities box set of Capt. Beefheart recordings should have at least half of it's content comprised of 1971-1982 material. What we have here is 4 1/2 CD's of material which is 90% drawn from pre 1970. How a colection of Beefheart rarities could omit ""Liitle Scratch"", ""Funeral Hill"" , ""Two Rips in a Haystack"" etc. is just a travesty. The 5th CD is comprised of various live recordings and radio appearances. The sound is shoddy in most cases, the choice of material is somewhat pointless. Overall, very disappoiting. This whole set has a very bootleg feel to it, except for the enclosed booklet which is superb! Hopefuuly someday someone will get it right for this guy."
3,The top 100?,"Although the information about each album cover is intriguing, I'd be hard pressed to agree that these are the top 100 best (or creative) album covers of all time. As a graphic designer, I feel that some of covers are downright dull - definately not worthy of the title bestowed upon them."
2,50 scientists CANNOT be found...,"John Ashton does his best, but he can't even come up with 50 scientists who support a young earth without including botanists, horticulture scientists, and mechanical engineers. Actually, fewer than half of the scientists presented in this book make specific arguments against an old earth. Their testimonials are sincere, but far from convincing for anyone looking for actual scientific evidence.Ashton, like all of the other answersingenesis crowd, suffers from an all or nothing mentality when it comes to supporting creation. Either one must swallow a narrow-minded interpretation of Genesis based on flawed hermeneutics, or one must reject God.Any reader who is looking for an honest evaluation of science within a Christian context will find nothing helpful here. If you are specifically looking for 50 scientists with evidence based arguments against an old earth, you won't find that anywhere."
1,Repeat of previous books. Nothing new.,I was highly disappointed in this book. I found it a rehash of the same information in the previous Family Manager books.
3,"WHITE color, not silver, just so you know","WHITE discs, not the usual silver which i prefer. Other than that okay. I just would have preferred silver. I wish the description had specified this fact."
1,Not the same as they used to be...,"In years past, I have bought these and had good results; not this last spindle! I don't like throwing half a spindle of cds in the trash! Will not buy again!!!"
3,Rather droll at times,"I am interested in some details of history and found a bit that I was unacquainted with in this work. The work has not bee updated, which is not surprising. The work would be more satisfactory if it was a bit more compelling. The author is complete, but manages to make the events lumber along at a rather dull pace. One would hope that there was a bit more excitement in the actual events than has been communicated here.Otherwise, Scandinavia would seem as gloomy a place as it must seem in some of the long winter periods of decreased daylight."
2,Meh,"I wasn't too impressed with the novel, but decided to give the movie a chance. Final verdict? As lackluster as the book was, the literary version is definitely better. This movie is rather predictable in some ways, and some parts are rather different from the book."
4,Timeline DVD,Good movie. Does not follow the book exactly but close enough to recognize the plot. I enjoyed watching the DVD after having read the book.
2,Good for a rainy weekend,"""Timeline"" is like the Amazon discription said good popcorn movie. I call it great popcorn cheese. I gave it two stars, but if you are looking at it as a popcorn cheese then it ranks as a 4 star in that genre.Timeline rapidly explains on how they discovered this wormhole. They are so quick at explaining how this happened I just feel that they couldn't come up with a good idea its like they talked under their breath and just hoped you really didn't hear how lame of a plotline how they discovered the wormhole.This movie just had you laughing at the cheesy lines. This should have been on SciFi Channel Saturday night movie. Its perfect for that. Great bad acting (Paul Walker, who makes Vin Diesel look like Christopher Walken) and of course cheese lines after line. Even a nice cute little ending.This movie is definitley a rental, but wouldn't waste money on purchasing it."
5,The Waterworld of the 00s,"This movie is the Waterworld of the next generation. Its like they combined Dragonheart, Braveheart, Fast and the Furious, and the Time Machine (sorta). Instead of kevin costner, you get Paul Walker & that guy from 300. You can tell they spent most of the money for this movie on the end sequence which is utterly amazing and I won't spoil it for you here. All the costuming is perfect. This movie suffers from poor editing, but I could care less because the plot is amazing. People who don't like this movie probably aren't fans of time travel or adventure or can't comprehend the storyline...and guess what, if you don't like this movie, your not cool."
2,Buy the book!,"Very bad screen adaption of a book!!The book kept the reader riveted and enthralled. This movie just has some fun explosions and battle scenes but gets completely lost during the one and a half hours on the screen.I won't even discuss this movie in detail, it's not worth it. If you want sincere enjoyment, buy the book online. A new copy from an Amazon affiliate bookseller starts at $1.59 (not a bad investment).Pity though, the book was fantastic..."
2,How to ruin a good book.,"What is it about Michael Crichton books that are so easy to screw up? Good movies are possible from Crichton's work, such as Jurassic Park and Andromeda Strain. From Congo to Sphere, though, Crichton's books have made horrific movies. Timeline is no exception. I consider Timeline, the book, to be one of Crichton's crowning works. This movie however, is a total wreck. The plot is lost in a sea of overworked special effects. Paul Walker was a horrible choice for his role. The plot changes lose the audience. The science of the movie seems to be lost in the rush to make a good action movie. If you want a good movie, look elsewhere, if you want a good book, read Timeline."
2,Ehhh,Not nearly as good as the book... almost a different story... was disapointed in this movie. buy it if you must
1,"Spend your $$ on the book, not this film","I read the book by Michael Crichton and loved it. However, when my friends and I headed excitedly to the theater to see the movie, we were actually embarrassed to be sitting there when the lights came up. Horrible script, laughable editing...it does no justice to the book whatsoever.Posting this will hopefully prevent further victims."
3,An exciting movie!,"It was OK. It was exciting especially the siege, but not really close to one of the best movies of the year."
3,It's is an Okay Movie.... without a Cherry on top,"The movie itself is okay, but it suffers from lack of Medieval violence. When I watched it in Decemeber of 2010 I was like, wasn't the 100 year war very violent with great warfare. And yet the movie felt empty. I love epic movies but this movie was like an ice cream sundae. Except it has no cherry on top!"
2,This and a bowl of haggis won't even buy a cup of coffee-,"The only reason I gave this limburger cheese of a film 2 stars was that you DID get to see Gerard Butler without his shirt on. I assume that is the only reason anybody would rent this film. He would have to pull a ""full monty"", though, to earn any more stars for this clunker, in which case I for one would happily rate it 5 stars and wear out the rewind button.You can't blame the actors for bad script, bad plotting and bad directing. The final ""surprise"" at the end was telegraphed so that even a child could see it coming, which mine did. Paul Walker wasn't any worse an actor than the guy who played Dr. Lupin in Harry Potter -you could see HIS fate coming a mile away also. Walker's look was too ""surfer dude"" for the film, but in the end you felt sorry for ALL the actors involved. Donner ought to be spanked, but then again, maybe not, as it might give him ideas for even more dreadful movies."
3,Good Adventure,Anyone who likes Gerry Butler will like this movie. The story is entertaining and will keep any SiFi types happy.
5,Excellent Buy!,"The Daniel Tiger series is thoroughly enjoyable, teaches great values, and keeps both my 2 year old and 6 year old entertained. They would watch this episode over and over again if I let them - we'll definitely purchase additional episodes of this series!"
1,Please read the review from Southern Indiana.,"She is absolutely right! I really enjoyed Tall, Dark and Deadly. I foolishly thought Long, Lean and Lethal would be up to that standard. The storyline was very weak and especially uninteresting to me. Was this a mystery or a soap of a soap opera? Why wasn't the ""secret passageway"" plot built up more, to strengthen this storyline? That was the only interesting part of the book! I cannot wait to get this book out of my personal library, and I will most likely not read the rest of this trilogy."
1,"Love Harry, Hate Randy","I Love Harry Nilsson, but can't listen to this album because I can't stand Randy Newman. ALL of the songs were written by Randy and are well-crafted and poetic and BORing. This is really just an UNbearable Randy Newman album with the Fabulous Harry Nilsson singing lead vocals. By the time the first version of ""Cowboy"" ends I'm ready to kill Harry for doing an entire album of Randy's songs. By the second time ""Cowboy"" ends- with the alternate take-I'm ready to kill myself for buying it! My recommendations: ""Harry"" for pure pop genius tunesmith and excellent cover songs, ""Nilsson Schmilsson"" and ""Son of Schmilsson"" for touches of genius laced with silly humor, and ""The Point"" (buy the video and the CD) for a meaningful children's story narrated by Ringo Starr and sung by Harry."
1,"Very tiring read, not worth the time.","Unless you have degree in Physic, I suggest you do not read this book. Because you will be completely lost with this book like me, it has so many scienticfic teminologies. I can hardly catch up with it. I check the Science dictionary back and forth. Eninstein probably would be the only one to understand it. It is a very tiring read. I wish author could have made it simpler for average human. And the case studies, probably only author can understand it himself. The book is a failure."
4,Remote Viewing,I have always been interested in remote viewing and find this book quite informative but find it is not for the average seeker of knowledge and reading it can be very daunting to the novice.
4,Barthelme's Best Book,"Gambling that brings you on the riverboat and gives you a glimpse of WHY people do it w/o maudlining out in a 12-step quagmire, ennui that doesn't make the book drag, hilarious man versus teenager (as funny/insightful as richard ford got it in Independence Day), interesting take on close/distant couples, and Mississippi like it is-- channel surfing, fast food eating, forget the mimosas and petticoats. And Piggly-Wiggly for one and all."
5,THE WALL LIVE!!!!! THE BEST OF ALL,"The Wall Live is the best of all Live PINK FLOYD albums I would have to say. It features the origional songs that never made their way on to the origional album, like What Shall We Do Now? and The Last Few Bricks. It may have been recorded over 20 years ago but the re-mastering is fantastic. In the second Master of Ceremonies you can hear someone yelling ""Shut Up!""Some of the songs sound better than the studio album ""The Wall"", such as In The Flesh and The Happiest Days of Our Lives.The main thing I Like about this LIVE album is that the whole band is in it. Most of the new stuff is seperate like Roger Waters In The Flesh - LIVE and David Gilmour in Concert. IT IS FAMNTASTIC IT ALSO COMES WITH TWO VERY INFORMATIVE BOOKLETS AND A THICK DOUBLE CASE."
3,An adequate rendition,"This was a used recording. The jewel case was badly cracked (I use a rubber band to keep it together). Two of the tracks on the first disc will not play through on my CD player, although iTunes had no trouble with them, so I decided to keep the set.I'm not a great fan of live performance recordings, so no matter what the quality, I probably would never give it 5 stars. At least 'Comfortably Numb' came through quite well."
5,Sweet cover art to boot !,"I didn't know what to expect, would it be true to the album, better, worse? It is better, by quite a bit, especially because of the new tracks. They are not new to the movie, but to the album they are. I LOVE ""where do we go from here"" and ""run like hell"" The band goes into a real Saucer Full of Secrets thing in the middle, which is out right awesome. The final song is quite different than the original, but still sounds really good. Even if you own The Wall sudio album, I still suggest buying ""Is There Anybody Out There"" Oh yea...and the Colorado Avalanche RULE!"
3,"Is There Anybody Out There? Well, kinda...","LIke most live albums, they usually serve as a souvenier for those who were there. Othertimes, it's like a friend showing you family photos. They look interesting, but you can't quite see what the point was, leaving you feeling distant. Such is the case here. Yes, all the songs are here, it's well recorded, and it's the only official live recording of the band with Waters and Gilmore. Waters sounds fine, and Gilmore has a nice solo during Comfortably Numb. But it doesn't bowl you over the way the studio album does with all its masterful sound effects and segues from one track to the next. Even The Wall: Live In Berlin has more surprises and character than this recording. The book in the limited edition is well done and is worth getting just to see how they got this off the ground. But it's nothing special."
5,a classic,"i was one of the few lucky enough to be at the fisrt long island show on feb 24 1980.not that i had a ticket. all the money i had(about300.00)could'nt get me a ticket. luckily,myself and 9 others paid a ticket taker $25 apiece to slip us threw without a ticket.10 minutes before showtime.those were the days.absolute classic recording.thanks again mr. ticket taker 28 years later."
3,Something Missing,"This Is a great set, and I couldn't wait to hear it when I first picked it up. But, there are a few problems....The main problem is that the sound quality is definitely not up to Pink Floyd standards. The bootleg-like sound doesn't make sense. I was reading the liner notes, and it said it was recorded at several cities along the tour, so I thought maybe the recording was bad on that particular night, but maybe this was the best performance.....but the whole set sounds like this.???...Leading me to beleive that this was put out as 'pruduct'. Pink Floyd used to pride themselves on the sonic fidelity of their recordings. I guess the other problem would be, as other reviewers have stated, that it needs a visual 'push' to help out. A DVD release would have been more welcomed. But, this set is basically required for any Floyd fan, and the accompanying book is very nice."
4,Very entertaining,"I wish it would follow the track progression of the studio album, but it is still a fun listen."
3,It's my own fault...,"Okay, I admit that I got really excited by the GoldBox price...and how it says it's the ""Deluxe Limited Edition""...and that it offered SO much more in this edition,BUT!They REALLY need to emphasize more that this is NOT a DVD.Also, as CD set with MERELY a ""Behind the Scenes"" book, it does not offer anything more than you can get online from almost any Pink Floyd fansite. The CD itself is not much to rave about either.So, in conclusion:I admit that I am NOT a fan of ""live"" performances. I am a purist. I love the sound of the ORIGINAL songs, not the enhanced-to-give-the-people-a-different-experience style.However, I was willing to give this a shot. If it weren't for the good price from GoldBox, I'd be returning it. I already own the audio CD.Well, I'm off to enjoy the words and pictures of a great concert through the eyes of a photographer while I listen to a mere CD of live music."
5,A Day at the Beach,Very relaxing and beautiful piano playing. The sea in the background gave a cosmic feel to the CD. Highly recommended to make you feel good after any hectic day.
3,"Cool, but bulky!","This is a cool cell phone case. I bought it to replace an worn case - but which I liked because it was not bulky. From the description, I did not know the product had a steel buckle. Take out the steel buckle, and replace it with a leather buckle that you can just slip into the belt as you wear it. The steel buckle is not only too bulky (and therefore protrudes a lot), it can slip off the belt...as it did recently and I dropped the cell phone, almost damaging it. You should design this product to not be dependent on belt width, which the steel buckle does. The design is awesome, but the steel takes away a lot!"
2,Charlie's Angels,"Here's a checklist to determine whether you should watch this film:1) Does your brain need a rest?2) Are you just in the mood for something to go with popcorn?3) Do you think action in a movie is more important than plot?4) Did you find any of the Batman movies ""deep""?5) Do you just ADORE Drew, Lucy, Cameron, or all of the above?6) Can you suspend all disbelief throughout the movie? (Drew Barrymore in a rubber mask = a large, deep-voiced black man???)7) Doh! Should've put this one first: Are you a teenager?If you answered ""Yes"" to any or all of these questions, you'll probably love this movie. If not, you'll either hate it... or you cheat on questionnaires."
3,The Angels were not so good this time.,"CHARLIE'S ANGELS is the 2000 remake of the popular 70's TV show. Cameron Diaz (Any Given Sunday), Drew Barrymore (The Wedding Singer) and Lucy Liu star in the film.MY REVIEW:""This film is ...just a comic book movie of THE MATRIX mixed with girl humor. The movie can be fun at times, and even cool with the kung fu special effects, but otherwise it's just a plain MATRIX with humor remake.""- MJV & the Movies."
4,Great adaption of a classic tv show,Charlie's Angels is one of the few movies next to the MI series that is a good adaption of the tv show on which it is based. All of the angels are perfectly cast and the action sequences directed by MCG are tight. Bill Murray is very funny as Bosely and it's a shame he wasn't be in the sequel. All in all good fun.
2,Should have included Austin Powers,"I just can't get into this kind of movie, there are ways to spoof things more subtly and still make your point. I'm glad I waited to rent this, and can't imagine wanting to ever see it again. I rented both this film and the second one to watch them back to back. Neither were boring, but one film spoofing the television show would have been enough.This movie kind of reminds me of the Austin Powers kind of flick, so I suppose, if you're into that kind of movie, this one will appeal to you as well. Definitely not recommended except as a nothing better to do rental."
1,They could have used the film for something else.,"I sat down to see this movie out of boredom and the oddest thing happened. I was more bored when it finished then I was at the start. This movie was so retarded it wasn't funny at all! The Matrix wasn't that good to start out with and they keep using it (too much in this waste of time). I personally could never recommend this movie. It was way too predictable and ""it just didn't bring the funny."" Also, it's one of those that you know its bad, but when you reflected on it, you really see just how bad it is. No good at all."
3,A guilty pleasure.,"But you can't go wrong.There's no moral, there's not much of a plot, there's not any point to be found, and no one in this movie seems to be taking anything seriously. So why is this flick so much fun to watch?I can't explain it. I felt like I shouldn't have liked it. I don't think I even wanted to like it, but I did. I laughed, I cheered, I soaked in the warmth of every explosion, and I really enjoyed myself.This movie is pure concentrated hyperactive fun, and, as long as you don't take it seriously or scrutinize it in any way, it's a silly and enjoyable ride.Cameron Diaz, as a playful ditz, bubbles and bounces into our hearts, Bill Murray does a good job as a sheepish Bosley, and Crispin Glover, without speaking a single line, is as creepy as ever.If you don't have a problem with the occasional piece of mindless fluff, add this to your collection. Mindless fluff doesn't get much better than this!"
4,"very fun, gets better every time","I own this on DVD now and love it! The 1st time I saw it I thought it was almost too goofy. The 2nd time I knew what to expect and just had fun w/ it. It's a movie you can watch over and over and just sit back and laugh and not take it too seriously. Cameron Diaz dancing in her undies cracks me up to no end! A GREAT, GREAT comedy."
2,Silly,"This movie is waste of time! The story is extremely silly! Yes, there is action, sexy girls... but that's all. The plot is silly, events are weak and dialogue is terrible.Some said, ""if you liked Mission Impossible you'd like this movie""! This is an insult. MI is great movie but this one is silly!"
4,"Fun. Fun, Fun!!!!!!","This movie is a blast to watch. Of course the plot is thin but thats what makes the movie so fun to watch. There are hot girls which the guys will like and the girls show off girlpower which the girls will like. The action scenes are well done and made me think of the matrix. I especially like Cameron Diaz in this movie and all the others are well cast. This movie is real fun, loud, and action-packed. If you are looking for a good time and not too much to think about then this is the movie."
1,PLEASE,"Ok this movie is obviously for women but somehow i got to see it when it was on HBO. This movie is for people too confused for the Matrix. So instead of getting confused with the Philosphy of the matrix ,come see Charlie's Angels which rips off the special effects but doesn't give a reason why ""The Angels"" can fly and flip and do all this stuff that can't possibly be done. Atleast in the matrix there was a reason. I would give this movie 0 stars if Amazon.com went that low. Hey if you didn't understand the matrix go see this movie. You will get all the action but no storyline."
4,Reliable,"This is an inexpensive brush that does as advertised. Good quality manufacture, though obviously its plastic not wooden. I didn't think the short handle would be an issue - actually it can be a bit uncomfortable on a very hot grill, but especially if I leave it next the grill while it's warming up so that the handle is hot already.So if I don;t do that it's fine."
5,New Tricks Season 8,New Tricks Season 8. This is an excellent series. Great characters. I have all 8 seasons and love them all.
1,Do Not Buy This Guitar,"We bought this for our 8-year-old daughter after first purchasing the black model, which broke after just a few days. The construction of this guitar is not strong enough for steel strings. The wood literally broke while the guitar was sitting in its case. After Amazon refunded our first guitar purchase (the black model), we bought this one and it broke as well just a few months later in exactly the same manner. In our opnion, this is a defective product and the only relief the manufacturer (Samson Technologies) will give is to give you another defective guitar."
5,The Best of the Best,I can't tell you how many YEARS I have been looking for this cd. Now my collection is complete. Thanks ...!!
4,Worth it,"Who doesn't like Evelyn ""Champagne"" King? She'd always put out plenty good music back in the day I was more than happy to find ""Back to love"" which didn't get enough radio play nor would you find it on any of her ""best of"" series. A true rare find. If you're REALLY old school, I can tell you this cd provides the lyrics which rates this cd a 10. You won't be disappointed buying this cd."
4,FINAL DAYS OF PSYCHEDELIC SOUL,"I don't have this CD, but I do have the original vinyl album of ""Sky's The Limit."" Although this album is great, it's so sad that it was the last Temptations album with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks. Even their #1 hit single ""Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)"" was their last with Eddie singing lead & Paul taking the bridge. Unfortunately, Paul didn't sing a note in other seven tracks, neither lead nor background. Simply because he was battling depression & alcoholism that ruined both his voice & dance steps. Eddie was singing lead in most of the tracks, like ""Gonna Keep On Trying Til I Win Your Love,"" ""Man,"" and ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" (better than Undisputed Truth's version). To me, this album had launched Eddie's decision to go solo. Dennis Edwards did contribute on a couple of songs, but the spotlight was on Eddie."
1,boring clay movie,"I really had to fight not turning this one off. It was boring! Soooo boring. Not only boring but all the jokes were stolen from other movies.And the clay is well, clay. A very austre film to view compared to a Pixar film. Animation wise? Very mechanical.I'm really suprised this one has gotten such good reviews because everyone I know hated it also!But if you like British humor this might be your cup of tea! As for me it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
3,Not as good as Wallace and Gromit,"If you are looking for Wallace and Gromit, you aren't going to get it ... although the animation is amazing, so these guys are fantastic. The movie itself just doesn't seem to have a plot that is good enough to get in to.I still like it, but if I lost this DVD, I wouldn't be heart broken."
5,I loooove this movie!,I saw this twice in the theater and love watching it at home with my kids!I am one if those people who watches a movie a bunch of times and learns the lines... this is the perfect movie for that - awesome quotable movie!!
4,Comical and full of Vigor!,"I loved the ""Wallace and Grommit"" films. This film was funny, emotional, inspiring and animated well. Definately more of an adult/teen movie, not really for children.""Chicken Run"" also had good voice actors too and it was nice to see it on the big theatre screen first."
4,Behold! My Review For Chicken Run!,"This is the sort of movie that's fun to watch many times, and it's as enjoyable to start in the middle as it is at the beginning. As if recognizing that those of us who grew up watching cartoons still enjoy animation, Chicken Run was made in such a way that it works well for people of double-digit years as well. It's just a cool as heck movie and I can't imagine anyone worth knowing wouldn't agree!"
5,A True Family Film,"Most family films seem to be made with the idea that the ""innocence"" of children is actually stupidity. These films generally cause mental anguish for the parents and offer little hope of improving the child's ability to comprehend plot or dialogue. Chicken Run is the rare exception. This film is intelligent and witty. It appeals to each member of the audience at their own level so the whole family can enjoy it together...novel idea, eh?"
3,Chicken no fun,"Sorry, but I didn't find this to be the ""Toy Story II"" of 2000. I didn't even find it to be the ""Toys."" I like Nick Parks' work, but these characters were just a little too cliche, at times a little too maudlin, and ultimately a little too -- too -- *British* -- to crack me up. Only the opening ""Great Escape"" title sequence and the adventure inside the piemaking machine kept me awake."
5,Coop 17,"I saw a preview of this movie on The Prince Of Egypt on DVD. I imediatlly wanted to see it. Now that I've seen it, it's my #1 movie! Anyways, here's my review:The chickens of Coop 17 long for a better life and have been trying to find a way out of the Tweedy's farm for some time, but when rhey finally have an escape plan, Mrs. Tweedy decides it is time to turn the entire flock into chicken pies."
5,Cheers for a new beginning!,"My daughter outgrew this movie but I didn't; there's a Ginger inside each one of us who longs for a new beginning.With or without your Rocky, you can start over. For a new beginning, and for the future, watch this movie... Cheers!"
5,Fabulous!,"A delight for the whole family! Kids will love the humor and talking chickens, adults will delight in the 'Great Escape' angle, and both will love the animation. Wonderful!"
2,"Don't waste your time, just read the back.",I did not like the book. First let me start off by saying pages where missing. Not from being torn but they just weren't in the book. Oh and if your like me and like to read the back of the book to find out what the story is about. Don't do it. He tells the whole story on the back. I thought the book was about the mother but then it ends up being about her kids who we don't meet until the end of the book. Just crazy. It reads as if the author just made the story along as he was typing and then put it up for sale without a proof-reader. Very very predictable.
5,A Must Read!,"We all have been victimized by the hood one way or another, but not all of us have mustered the courage to make it out successfully. In his debut novel, Richard Jeanty has created a path that's inspiring and positive to keep us hopeful in the hood. I recommend this book to everyone who lives in the hood and rasising children in the hood. Heck! I think every parent should read this book and when they're done with it, they should have their teenage children read it too. I don't understand the comparisons to Coldest Winter Ever, this book is completely positive and says a lot more about the courage of the characters."
5,FANTASTIC!,Perfect for what we wanted!! Strong - sturdy - PETITE - GORGEOUS!!!Just the right amount of sparkle - it doesn't always have to be carats cartats and more carats - this ring is wonderful!
2,Looks aren't everything...,"So...to first qualify myself. I've been canning for over 30 years - since I was able to walk & pick fruit/veggies from a garden. Historically, I've used ball jars with the 2-pc lids. So, that is my ""expertise"". I have never had experience canning with the single pc lid like these pretty jars had but I'm well versed with the english language & can read instructions pretty well. Anywho....over 50% of the lids didn't seal properly. The ones that did, only stayed sealed for a few days, and then popped. Too dang bad...these jars are meant to ""sit there & look pretty"", but don't expect much functional use from them. Will not buy again. They get 2 stars for looks & a big fat ZERO for functionality. Sorry~~"
2,Not the Soundtracks,"These rather dated arrangements lack the drama and beauty of the original soundtracks. Also, the entire album is only 28 minutes long. It's definitely not worth paying full price for."
4,Love this music!,"Years ago I had this LP and listened to it all the time. As years passed I wanted a casette or CD so I could listen to it on the go. Looked everywhere but couldn't find it so when I came across it thru Amazon I was very pleased. This music just seems to go with my outdoor activities, e.g., boating, camping, etc. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Has No Pizzaz,"This is pleasant enough listening, but after hearing the original performances, this is a watered-down version that has none of the haunting, sharp and unique sound that the originals had. I remember this album cover very well when it was first released as an LP record and a lot of copies must have sold. I am not sure why. Just buy the original soundtracks instead of this poor substitute."
3,All right,Was a little disappointed in some of the songs. If to do over again would have found different group to play the main songs.
4,Only works in a computer,"There is nothing wrong with this CD, but you should be aware that it only plays in computers. Don't make the mistake of thinking it's defective when you try to stick in a regular old-fashioned CD player. I wish somewhere in the product description it would state that, as it's very important to know."
2,Not very pleased,"I bought this video editing software with hopes of being able to capture clear images, but all I got was a low-resolution photograph. I could never get the audio to play while viewing live video, but for some reason the audio played back with the recording after playback. This happened while playing a DVD into the device. This product might be OK for Internet use if uploading video, but if you want to capture a clearer image and produce quality video don't waste your money on this product."
2,Ingredients???,I'm not buying a product that doesn't list all ingredients. Where can I get a list of your ingredients in this product?
2,Unsure,"I purchased this along with Bhrigraj oil in an attempt to aid hair re-growth. I've used it about 2 weeks and I tolerate it well. The tablets are green and uncoated so they start dissolving immediately in my mouth. I am hoping that Ayurveda does for my AGA what so far, nothing else has. I've increased my dose to twice daily and will update again in 60 days.**Updated February 1, 2013I'm still using this. I can't tell if its helping or hurting. I still have thinning but only on one side, on the other... shedding is still occuring. I'm unsure if ill purchase again. I've reduce my dose back to once dose. I'm just not sure that its this product that is helping at least some sections of my hair. I've taken this for four months and will continue my last 20 days and then decide."
5,A Twentieth-Century Classic,"This is a Twentieth-Century classic: superb execution of the most exciting compositions for the double bass since Koussevitsky. The performances by the Louisville Symphony Orchestra and Gary Karr of Ramsier's masterpieces, ""Divertimento Concertante"" and ""The Road to Hamelin"" had long been sold out in vinyl and here are re-mastered and issued in CD. In addition, the CD presents Mark Morton's virtuoso performance of Ramsier's ""Silent Movie""."
4,The Life of the great Modest Mussorgsky in Pictures,"This series offers, to varying degrees of success, portraits of some great Russian composers, all filmed on location. Here, Mussorgsky's interesting and tragic life is faithfully recounted; the video includes shots of his native village and later residences, now museums. Historic documentation, some illustrated, is also used, making for an informative biography. The problem with the series is the lack of treatment of the importance of the composer's oeuvre; students will have to look elsewhere for discussions of this nature."
2,Steer clear of it. Inaccurate advice.,"I've had this book for many years, along with many other books on nutrition, health, and medicine. These topics have been an interest of mine for decades, and I keep up with the latest research and information. I just flipped through this book again today, and was dismayed to find that much of its advice is very inaccurate and out of date. If you didn't know better and followed its advice, you'd remain deficient in many nutrients. Its dosage recommendations for numerous nutrients are WAY too low - vitamins D and C being two examples. Don't even bother reading this book. Find something more up to date and accurate."
5,Encyclopedia of Womens Lives,"A collection of brief excerpts from autobiographies of literary women around the world spanning then last 50 or so years.Stunning read as each excerpt offers a unique cultural, historical, political and emotional insight into the 'ordinary' lives we lead.Highly recommended."
4,Very Good,"I am very excited for this film. I hope that it is very good. The CD on the other was not what I was expecting, but I still like it. I don't understand how all of the songs are going to play out in the film, but they are all sang well. I was very suprised that Emmy could sing. I have seen her in films before and thought she was terrible, but on this CD she can sing, the way the character is meant to sing. I thought the CD was good, but some of the vocals for certain people could have been stronger, maybe it will come across different in the film. See what you think."
4,Good in all aspects,"This CD is good so that's why I think it gets 4 stars. I can give it five because I love it and the voices are very good and the music, but I have to be objective."
2,The Phantom was weak,"I'm really amazed at the selection Gerard Butler for the part of the Phantom. This had to be the biggest blunder in movie history. His voice is weak and limp. It has the power of a broken down Model T Ford. The rest of the cast provided a respectable performance, but if you want the true feeling and effect, buy the Soundtrack with the Original London cast. As far as the movie, do yourself a favor and go to the theater and see it live!"
5,Bravo to this wonderful cast album,"I saw the movie recently and had to have the soundtrack. One of the best movies I have seen and the music was outstanding. Gerard Butler, Emma Rossum.Patrick Wilson and the entire cast moved me.I recommend this album to all who adore music that has passion, sorrow and love. I can not wait to own the DVD when it is released."
5,A real winner,"Hauntingley Beautiful music.Andrew Lloyd Webber at his best.A cd for lovers to enjoy.Only one flaw,when the players talk,it's very hard to hear what they are saying.Not to worry,I know the words by heart."
3,Get the DVD,"Fans of POTO absolutely HAVE to get the DVD. First of all, it's the only one available. Secondly, despite a few flaws, it IS visually stunning. While you're watching it, the wonderful spectacle is everything. I found Emma Rossum quite believable and Gerald Bulter fullfilling the role he was cast for (a young, sexy phantom - WHY is another matter!) However, it must be admitted that their voices simply don't measure up to either of the available cast albums (where actors are picked for their SINGING ability). Butler has some good moments, but by the Phantom's Lair he's not even singing.So, get the DVD, but stick with the London and/or Canadian (my favorite) cast CDs."
5,What an awesome soundtrack!!!!!!,The reason why I gave the movie soundtrack of The Phantom of The Opera movie a five star is because how amazing everyone in the soundtrack sings. These songs and voices has enspired me throughout the past years. It has caused me to want to sing every single day of my life. I hope you do the same to others what you have done for me. So I hope you have a fantastic day.
4,Phantom Soundtrack,"This is an excellent CD, apart from the dreadful singing of Scottish Actor Gerard Butler in the title role, who as far as I'm concerned should have stuck to straight acting. Emmy Rossum's voice is exquisite and the bonus song by Minnie Driver is superb. The album is well worth buying and is a must for those who loved the 2004 Film."
1,Movie spectacular...sound track less so,"I loved the play. I loved the movie. I thought I would love the soundtrack. Until the talking started. I cannot stand soundtracks that are too lazy to remove the talk...that is sheer laziness. It's being pulled from the movie instead of being done totally separately. How lame. So while the music is probably great...who knows. I'm completely distracted because of the talk. Please, please someone come out with a soundtrack with NO talking. It doesn't need it. I buy the cd for the music. I buy the movie for the talk."
2,Disappointing`,"After having the soundtrack from the original cast, I really enjoyed the movie, which for me tied the music together for the first time. Unfortunately, the action of the movie evidently blunted my senses to the music. I ordered this disc with high expectations. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when I listened to the album. Realizing the intensity of feelings being protrayed in music, to me it was grating and over the top for several of the male leads. I enjoyed some of the female voices, although the sound level was a bit to low in volume for my liking. I suppose I'll have a once used copy up for sale. I'll go back to the original Broadway cast."
5,One of my all time favorites and bought it from Amazon.com,"I love this film although many people have compared Gerard Butler to Michael Crawford unfairly. When I watched this film when it came out, it was the first time I had even seen or heard of Gerard Butler. He has gone on to make some very good films and I just hope that he goes back to making those types instead of the silly romantic comedies of late. So Michael Crawford fans, be forewarned that this film may not be up to what you are used to. At any rate, on Blu Ray, this film is fantastic. I will probably watch this at least once a year.The seller sent it lightening fast and I am very pleased with them."
5,Absolutely awesome!,"I was a Phantom of the Opera lover long before I ever saw the play on Broadway 7 years ago. I, too, felt that the original London cast recording with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford couldn't be beat. BUT I was so wrong. Gerard Butler IS the ultimate Phantom. His singing is so much more how the Phantom should sound than Michael Crawford. Emmy Rossum's voice is even better than Sarah Brightman's - she is perfect as Christine. I am appalled that a few people have panned the movie and the singing of the actors - they ALL sound wonderful. I so much prefer the singing of Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum that I never listen to my London cast soundtrack anymore and I have almost worn out my movie soundtrack from listening to it so much. As I said in my title...absolutely awesome!"
1,singing? what singing?,"Emmy can't sing!!!!!!!!!!!! Sarah Brightman still looks like she is 20 yrs. old, why not cast her instead? Emmy scoops her high notes and everything else just is immature!!"
1,Save your money and go see the musical,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. Granted Rossum outperforms Brightman in her role as Christine Daae, the rest of the cast fails to support brillant Rossum. The movie and soundtrack fall flat because of the gravely inept rest of the cast. Honestly, what good is a handsome phantom who can't sing? Crawford is too old for the movie, alright, but there are far better singers on Broadway. Do your ears a favor - save your money and go see the musical for a true ""Phantom of the Opera"" experience."
2,Eh...,"I was hardly impressed. Emmy Rossum is adequate, and did have some wonderful moments throughout the movie. ""Raoul"" is also alright. The Phantom, however, struck me as being screechy at times. He just wasn't right. I am not a big fan of this movie, or the soundtrack. However, I am a fan of the original cast, so perhaps that's why."
2,What hapenned in the recording studio?!,"I have no doubt that this film will be a visual masterpiece, but what hapenned when they recorded this music? The voices are frequently off-key and lacking any depth. It's like they didn't stand close enough to the microphone. You can't quite hear them.And it doesn't seem to be just the voices, but also the orchestra who fails in this recording. It all seems to lack volume, depth, and grandeur.I won't even go into casting someone as the Phantom without depth of voice. It's just wrong. A large portion of the mystery and character of the Phantom lies in his powerful voice.As a long time fan of the musical I'm just disapointed in this recording. I've loved every production I've seen, and I've never seen Crawford and Brightman."
2,I am so Disappointed,"As a HUGE Phantom fan, I was VERY excited for Phantom to come out. I have seen it on stage 2X and read the book many times. I am very disappointed in the Soundtrack. Gerrard butchers Music of the Night and All I Ask of You (Reprise). I actually found myself cringing everytime he sings. Emmy has a good voice but is too soft and lacks the range. Her voice is not at all strong. The only strong point is Patrick Wilson. He is the only one with an actual voice that sounds like he belongs in a musical opera. I could go on and on about how bad this, but I will not. I can't help but think that casting Gerarrd was a mistake."
3,Soundtrack? More like highlights!,"When I picked up this soundtrack, I couldn't wait to listen to it! Sure, it doesn't beat the original cast recording, but Gerard Butlers' rock style, and Emmy Rossum's more 'modern' operatic vocals make an excellent duet. And don't get me wrong: I am completely obsessed with POTO and Gerard Butler--this has to be my favorite movie and among the best CDs I own!Unfortunetly, not all the songs from the movie made it! For some reason (probably to make more money) their 'soundtrack' is more like the highlights of the movie--and for people like me, who can't STAND highlights, this is a huge problem. So, I would definitely suggest the ""extended"" version if you really want to experience the movie; some tunes, like 'Stranger Than You Dreamt It' and 'Notes' are noticeably gone. The full one is much more touching, although both still sound incredible. Be sure to pick one up!"
2,Not nearly as good as the original.,"The music is great! Love the fuller orchestra and the sound is amazing, but...but Gerard Butler can't really sing (I hope his acting is better than his singing).Mr. Butler sounds like he is trying too hard to sound like Crawford's phantom, and miserably fails in the attempt. Michael Crawford will forever BE ""the phantom"", but even Kiss' Paul Stanley did a better job with the vocals (specially the higher notes)than Gerard Butler.The rest of the cast is fairly good, but not as good as the original Broadway cast, or others I've seen on stage.I wish Amazon would've let you hear the streaming of the CD before I bought it."
3,"LOVE the songs, don't like the voice.","Okay, I love love love these songs, I can not stand the female voice, it's not big enough. And maybe it has nothing to do with range, I don't feel like she can sing at all. Is there a phantom cd that has like, sarah brightman or something?"
3,better on screen,"i saw the movie ""the phantom of the opera,"" and decided i couldnt live without the soundtrack. when my friend burned a copy of it for me, however, i was a little disappointed. their voices seemed so much better when watching the movie. i think this has much to do with the fact that you cant see all of the effects - for instance, in ""the mirror (angel of music)"" the phantom sings ""i am there inside,"" and the mirror shows his own translucent reflection overlapping christine's and its wonderful.dont get me wrong - i'm listening to the soundtrack right now, actually, as i type this, and im so glad that i have it. but im saving my money for the DVD."
5,Awesome,I absolutely love this soundtrack. The movie is great and these cd's have all of the music. It's a wonderful buy and I would recommend it over all of the others.
5,Gerard Butler!!!!!!,"I will watch or listen to anything with Gerard Butler! Of course The Phantom of the Opera is wonderful, but I love the soundtrack and movie to hear him. I even watched 300 just to see the body. Listen to this all the time."
3,Blueman Fun not worth Vegas ticket price.,"I saw the show in Vegas 5-14-05. This show opens with a promising visual effects screen then introduces the 3 Blue men. I could see the BMS's attempt to creating art but I didn't think they succeeded. The other musicians created mesmerizing tunes, however. I did pick up some sampling of KLF's ""what time is love"" & other tunes from the group's ""The White Room"" album. The strange thing is that I haven't seen any mention of this fact on the BMS CDs or any of the show's reviews crediting the KLF. In the end of the shows they overwhelm you with a lot of strips of white paper. Maybe they're hoping you'll connect an illusion? If you're thinking of seeing this show, don't pay over $100 2c it. One last thing, this show was late getting started. One thing they did which was hypocritical was when a couple of people arrived late, they made an announcement that these people were late."
5,Audio - Blue Man Group,This is a stellar CD... The pace and dynamics are outstanding (Wimpy speakers beware!). This is one of the more original recordings I have heard in a while... It makes me want to see the live show again.
5,Audio is Awesome,"I guess I'm a little bit biased, having seen their show 3 times, but the cd is great. You don't really get the full effect of the music unless you crank it up really, really LOUD. Even if you haven't seen the show, Audio is great rock/very slightly new age-ish instrumental album. Run, don't walk to pick up this cd."
4,Syncopated Pandemonium!,"The music reminds me of ""Stomp"" - the stage show, with other instruments added. I heard it for the first time today, and played the CD over about 4 times! I love it!"
4,A+,"I was a spelling bee nut growing up, and this is the sort of book I always wanted to see. Yes, I'm one of the ""word nerds"" (1986 National Spelling Bee contestant, current magazine editor, and winner of a corporate spelling bee a few years ago), so I thoroughly enjoyed the book's journey through the history of spelling bees, the National Bee, the English language, and the dictionary, plus the peeks behind the scenes as the spellers prepare, the word list is assembled, and Bee Week progresses. The author captures all the inherent humor and drama of competitive spelling, and it was easy to see he enjoyed doing it."
5,CArs of the 50s,"I was born in 1947 and enjoyed following the unveilling of new car models each year. This book showed the ones that were real ""show stoppers""."
4,A Lightweight Intro to Modern Exprimental Genetics,"This is the very interesting history of the research of genetics, evolution, and biology using the very versatile tool <i>Drosophilia melanogaster</i>. However, it is written for a non-scientific audience. There are numerous puns and jokes about the humble fruit fly and the explanation of genes and alleles is reduced to an analogy of shoes on people's feet. This may help people who have absolutly no science background understand the subject, but I found the poor analogies to be distracting.On the other hand, the history was absorbing. How were maps of genes created before fancy sequencing machines? The answer lies in the close study of thousands of generations of fruit flys and studying their mutations. Many discoveries of basic genes that are present in all life forms are first found in the fruit fly. Many more discoveries are yet to be made."
3,mis leading,"It's lead...What more can I say. I guess the lead was what I expected. how many more words do I have to put in before I can submit this review, Oh, OK finally."
4,Rutherfurd has a particular style...,"I both like and dislike Rutherfurd's style. Having read The Forest, which was decent but not one of my favorite historical novels, I was concerned about Rutherfurd taking on the sweeping history of Ireland, one of my favorite countries. I have to say, however, that he did a wonderful job--he included many things I have studied as well as many things that I had never heard of before. The one complaint I have is that it seemed like whenever I got to the point where I wanted to know more about the characters, he moved tens or even hundreds of years into the future, leaving me just a bit disappointed that I did not hear the whole of said characters' stories. I understood from reading The Forest that this was his writing style, but at the same time, that is the reason I could not give this novel five stars."
2,Less is not more,"Faced with a long road trip and holding a love of Irish history, I took the CD version of The Princes of Ireland with me. While the reader does a wonderful job with the changing Irish accents, Dublin vs. Leinster, Ulster vs. Munster, educated vs. ""regular folk"", the abridged version is even harder to follow than some have described the written. Just when you start to get to know a character, they're gone and you've jumped ahead a few hundred years and the ties between the stories are thin.Rutherfurd follows some of the styles of James Michener in that he takes a geographical place and weaves the people and history in and around it. But it doesn't work here and while I love the sound of the Irish voices, the story leaves me wishing Michener had written about Ireland."
4,Good book,A must read if you are going to travel to Ireland. I went to Ireland in September and it was nice to have the back ground history of Ireland.
3,Audio version disappoints.,"I checked out this book on CD from my local library, but I didn't immediately notice that it was abridged. I felt like I was missing a great deal of continuity, not to mention maps (and hopefully genealogy charts) that surely must be in the book. If you have the option of listening or reading, I strongly recommend reading this book. I will not listen to the second part of the Dublin Saga on CD. I am not sure if I will re-""read"" this book in print -- if I do, it will be to clear up the many questions I had after listening to it."
1,Very disappointing,"Rutherfurd's first book,Sarum: The Novel of England, is one of my favourite novels. He repeats his 'Sarum' formula of following successive generations of several families across a broad expanse of history in several further books, almost as successfully in some, and less so in later ones. Sadly, though, his book was so poor I eventually abandoned it. I don't know if Rutherfurd has been beating a dead horse, format-wise, or whether he maybe just didn't have the interest in his subject that he did in earlier works, but the end result is a sad departure from the usual standard. As disappointed as I was, however, I have not given up on this author. I have recently ordered his latest workNew York: The Noveland I am very much looking forward to seeing if he will redeem himself."
3,somewhat disjointed,"This is on 8 cd's and Mr. Keating makes the story. With his wonderful Irish accent adding the authentic touch that kept me listening when i might have given up after the ist generation of Irish ancestory were killed off. Then it jumps up to a new group of ancestors of the original group, and so on and so on. At the end we are in the 15 and 1600's, So you know there is more to come. After 9 hours and 8 discs I was glad that I listened rather than try to read through to the point where he stops. I recommend the audio just to listen to an Irishman read the story. It totally enhances the experience."
1,This is an insult to the Choral Music of Leo Sowerby.,"I have performed a number of choral works by Leo Sowerby, including many Anthems, Service Music and his Cantata, ""Forsaken of Man"" under the conductor and organist, Dr. Ronald Arnatt at Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis, Mo. The Organ and Brass performances are adequate, but the Choral and Solo Vocal performances are only barely acceptable. Both the choral and vocal sound is very immature with the exception of the soprano solo in the final selection. Hopefully these works will receive their deserved recorded performance in the future."
1,These Guys [Stink],"I have never heard a worse CD in my life than this piece of [junk]. God, how do guys like this get music made? I'm quite sure that I could write a song and produce it if these knucklehead [guys] can do it. Other than cool titles (Dead Gringo Malt Liquor), you have to wonder why this album would be purchased. I award you 0 stars and may God have mercy on your souls."
1,HORRIBLE,"I know I might sound a bit like Simon from American Idol, but that went from bad to worse. It makes my ears bleed!"
1,"Weird, weird book","I don't know what makes people think this is such a wonderful book. It's really *weird*. The mother creeps along the floor of her sons room at night to crawl into bed with him. Then, when he leaves the house as an adult, she drives across town with a ladder, and climbs up into his bedroom window at night while he's sleeping. It's CREEPY. Don't buy this book thinking it's ""all nice and stuff"". It's not, it's downright weird."
1,"Disturbing and Creepy, at the level of Fatal Attraction","What did I just read?! I honestly don't know what to say. My 4-year-old was creeped out before I was.If a middle-aged man told me that his mom drove across town with a ladder, climbed in his window, watched him while he slept, and then rocked him in her lap while singing lullabies, then I would suggest that he quickly gather his wife and kids and move to an undisclosed location."
1,Creepy Indeed!,My in-laws were in town when I received this book. We all cried! It's very creepy and way too sad. Not even going to read it to my child.
5,Love You Forever wonderful!,I loved this book ever since i heard someone doing it as an oral language festival when i was in grade school. and now since I've had a son of my own . I read this story to him nightly and never get tired of it. It's great story from the mother's prosepctive as her one and only grows though the years. I find it touching to the heart and now I almost have it memorized. And to say it again this book is a wonderful story for all mom's to get and read to their babies and toddlers.
4,Book (Love you forever),Enjoy reading the book to my grandsons. Must admit I skip the part when the little boy flushes his mothers watch down the toilet. Don't want to give them any ideas. Hehe
4,Love You Forever,This book was a great book. I've loved it ever since I was a little kid and my mother would read it to be everynight before I went to bed. I would highly recommand this book to anyone. It is a fun loving books that both parents and children will love.
5,The most touching book I've ever read,"My grandma had this book laying around and I happened to read it while visiting her (several years before I had a child). It was the sweetest, most touching book I'd ever read. Robert Munsch has managed to capture the true spirit of unconditional love. I bought this when I was pregnant for our daughter's library, and had a good cry all over again when I read it after bringing it home. I still can't read it (especially out loud!) without crying. I bought this for my best friend when she found out she was expecting, and she loves it, too. Everyone - old, young, parents, grandparents, even single people - should own this book."
1,creepy and sad,"Creepy I agree with all the bad reviews. The mother is sneaking in the older boy's room and then adult's house??!! Should've kept it a baby theme since it is meant for them. Also ""as long as I'm alive"" not only makes it obviously implied that the mom dies in the end, but what happened to always watching over your kids even when you are not alive- which would be too mature and still sad of a theme for a young childrens' book-- which brings me to- why even add ""as long as I'm alive???????"" How do I explain that to my kid? I think I will stick to ""mommy and me,"" ""daddy and me"", ""mommy hugs"" and ""daddy hugs""..."
4,Good book for those who don't analyze everything,"My sister gave this book to me recently and I loved it. Yes, it makes me teary eyed. To those ""well-adjusted"" folks who think it's about incest and are wondering where the daddy is, etc., I can only imagine what kind of spin you put on The Cat in the Hat? Are you people concerned that the Cat or Thing One or Thing Two are perverts? LIGHTEN UP.This book is about unconditional love. It's symbolic of a mother's love for her child - no matter how old your child gets, they are always your baby. Get it? If people are taking this so seriously, I can only assume that they didn't like Green Eggs and Ham either for fear of a child eating moldy food.This is a lovely book for the non-paranoid."
5,timeless,"I loved this book as a child, and now I share it with my children. I have read it to my twins almost every night as I rock them to sleep."
3,Scary for a child,"First when reading the book my ten year old daughter was laughing. Then getting to the end and the mother dies, she was crying. I bought this book to help her because she is going through some things now, not upset her more. Her father died and this book had her crying in bed saying, ""I don't want you to die mommy"". I just think he shouldn't of made the mom die its scary for children."
5,Very moving,"This book went right to my heart, and is a very innocent story. I was amazed to read some of these reviews."
4,"Love You, Forever","Even though this book may bring tears to my eyes, it reminds me of my own Mother who died of cancer and can no longer hug me for comfort nor encourage me when things go wrong. I miss her dearly and this book reminds me of her love for us kids."
1,Uggh!,"This book really gives me the creeps. We received a copy as gift and I gave it away. I know it's very popular, more so with adults than children, but I think you either love it or hate it. I hated it."
1,Sick and wrong,"That's not love people, that's called narcissism. Pathologically obssessed with you forever. Oedipally yours forever. Disguising my own self-indulgent and destructive behavior as self-congratulatory generosity forever."
2,Ummm...,"I'm a pediatric nurse, and just came across this book on the job. I had no idea there was controversy! I was prepping a three year old for spinal surgery, and her parents were reading it to her. She seemed to like it and be comforted by it (though, to be fair, she WAS flying high on Versed at the time).Me? I was kinda squicked. Maybe I'm too midwestern for this book, or something. The mom? Creeping on her belly to the teenager's bed? Yeah. That.Two stars because the kid seemed to like it, and I guess that is the important thing. They were a very nice family, not weirdos at all, and were so happy to show the book to me...is it perhaps like a cult, and they were drawing me in?"
1,Have to agree with creepy!,"I love the repeating mantra of this book, but dislike the application. Surely there is a way to communicate this without having dear old mother sneak into your house every night while you're asleep! I get where the book is going, I just didn't like the journey."
3,Review---Love You Forever,"Very simple reading. The complexities come from the personal feelings that the reader puts into it. Most all of us have deep feeling about family members, and this story brings them to the surface for almost everyone. It's not the book, it's life thats great!"
2,Love You Forever,"Love You Forever is a pretty good book. You can understand it quite well, because it is is just telling how a boy grew up and something bad happens along the lines. This book has lots of feelings on how a family member's loss is affected. The mother always looks out, going to a room and sings to him. I recommend this book to parents that have a newborn or is getting one. I would compare this book to something good and this is better than that book. That is my review and I hope you like it.Thank You!"
1,Creepy!,"This book is extremely creepy! The old woman crawling through the bedroom window and over her grown son's body sleeping in his twin bed and then picking him up to rock him while he's still asleep...GROSS! Needless to say, the copy I had was thrown in the garbage."
3,definitely creepy,"My sister was given this book by her MIL when she had her baby. Her MIL said she used to read this to her kids when they were little. We had never heard of it, but we sat and laughed and laughed over the creepiness of the mom sneaking into her grown son's room. Just plain old weird. Parts of the book are cute, but the end ruins it for me and takes all of the sweetness out of it."
5,Touching story of devotion,"This story is often misconstrued by adults. My mother bought this book for me when I was 7 and I have loved it ever since. I am now 21 and if I ever decide to have children, this is one of the first books I would give to them. It is a tender story of devotion and love; something this world is lacking in. I highly suggest you find a copy of this book and read it for yourself, so you are not mislead by negative reviews."
5,this is my favorite book of all time!,I am so looking forward to reading this to my grandchildren and to my future students in my own classroom. Thank you!
5,"Loved it as a child, love it as a mom","I was first introduced to this book in elementary when one of my teachers read this book to the class, and I have never forgotten it. It always gave me the warm and fuzzies as a kid, and I was always a little sad at the end because the mom got sick. But that just made me want to go hug my mom and dad, because it reminded me that they won't always be around. Now that I'm a mom, it makes me want to hug both my parents and my kid because not only am I reminded that my parents are getting older, my baby won't always be a baby, and I should savour every moment. I never got any creepy or incest vibes from this book, and maybe it was because I was a kid when I was first introduced to this book, and my teacher read it simply as a declaration of love from a parent to their child."
1,"Horrible, I threw it in garbage","I got this book as a shower gift, and it looks so sweet. It made me cry in a BAD way, not in a sentimental way. Its weird and basically about the mother getting old and sickly and dying and leaving her son. I don't want to think about getting old and leaving my new baby. Just the worst book I've ever read."
1,Creepiest Book EVER,"This book has always been disturbing to me. Talk about not knowing how to let go of your kids. The mother in this book is, frankly, nuts, and the son needs to get a restraining order against her.What does his wife think about the fact that his mom sneaks in his room and rocks him in the middle of the night? Is nobody else disturbed by that image?And the people who think this book is sweet--I fear for your children and the relationships you will have with them as adults. Seriously, I understand, as a parent, how you will cherish your relationship with your kids for the rest of your life. But your relationship HAS to change and mature, otherwise...Well...you'll be like creepy mom. (I will give points for the end where the son loves his mom back, that's kinda sweet...but only if you forget about all the mom-stalking during his adult years.)DO NOT GIVE THIS BOOK TO ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT. As they used to say about nuclear weapons: NOT HEALTHY FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER LIVING BEINGS."
1,"horrendously creepy, both illustrations and text. run away! run away!","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. DO NOT PASS THIS BOOK ALONG. DO NOT GIVE THIS BOOK TO GOODWILL OR THE THRIFT SHOP OF YOUR CHOICE AND CERTAINLY NOT TO FRIENDS. BURN IT OR TRASH IT PROMPTLY. honestly this book is horrible. the illustrations are absolutely gaggy and extremely ill-drawn. the text is really gooey and creepy and depressing. can we all just stop this book in it's tracks? i know of so many great books that die unknown, why is this one still circulating? don't buy into the schmaltz. please stop purchasing it!"
1,CREEPY!,"My MIL gave this book to my husband when our first baby was born. Hellish MIL experiences we have all heard about soon followed. This book is totally creepy, tries to normalize complete lack of BOUNDARIES and inappropriate behavior. YIKES!"
4,Love You Forever,"Robert Munsch did a great job depicting parental love. Though the book is writing in simple language, the message is clear about unconditional love. Every household should have one."
1,Never again,"They should place a disclaimer on this book that post partum mothers should not read. Between my post partum hormones and the schmaltziness of this, I was a slobbering mess. I will never again read it, as it upset my daughter to see her mama upset. I also agree that this is borderline obsessive/stalkerish and brings helicopter parenting into a new light (no helicopter mom can be as hovering as this one). I understand the sentiment, but think its better for middle America than in the coasts."
2,Depressing,"I did not like this book because it was very unrealistic.It also had too many words and we all know that a toddler would not sit through a very long book. Plus is a very emotional subject to read to a kid under the age of seven years old.I would only recommend this book for ages seven and older or if you're going to talk to a child about a relative who is dying or very sick. Personally, I would not buy this book for my three year old but is only my opinion."
5,Tear Jerker!,"I love this book! I have yet to get through to the very end without choking up - even after 8 months of practice! I think this book is a wonderful way to express to your child that, no matter how big they get, you will always be their Mommy! I feel sorry for the poor, misguided soul who is unable to see this book for the beautiful, warm fuzzy feeling it will create with your child."
1,Traumatizing book as a child,"Like many of the others, I found this book to be very unsettling as a child. Especially the image of an old person crawling in the window... I didn't like this book and I still dont"
5,Very sweet childrens book....a true mothers love!!!,"My teacher read this to our 8th grade lit. class. She cried through the book and I wondered why as an 8th grader she was crying from reading a childrens book??? Now that I am grown and a mother of 3 children, I now understand!!!!! Something incredible happened to me---I turned into a mother and now I love this book. Always makes me tear up! My kids love it!!!"
5,"I found it to be very heartwarming with a surprise ending,",I have read this book many times to my three children and they know mommy will cry each time she reads it. They laugh at the illustrations and see themselves in many of them. I have given the hardcover to parents at showers and baptisms. Everyone has truly injoyed the wonderful story about a mother and sons love for each other. I think it is a great book no matter if you have a son or a daughter.
5,a childs book at its simplest,"i read this book to my nephews on a regular basis. it was purchased by my mom and will remain a classic in our family. the moms actions are over the top but this is to prove a point. if people remember that this is a childrens book the inner child in them may be found again. this is a tear jerker that should have won a caldecott award.if, on the off chance, this book brings up the issue of death then discuss that topic with your child. there are great books on that subject. unfortunately my grandfather died when my nephews were very young (6 mths and 1 1/2 year) so they were not afraid of death. they saw the family celebrate life and this book teaches us to do that-express your love while the person is alive so that there will be no doubt of your love being forever!"
1,Wow...,"a lot of the reviewers talk about this book like it is the Bible or something. Perhaps the Freudian overtones aren't terribly damaging to children, who do not catch the adult interpretations of this book; however, the subtle message of mother-son/father-daughter exclusivity in a family is extremely one-dimensional. I find myself rolling my eyes everytime I have to put it on the shelf for a visit because a well meaning relative gave it to us. This is not because I've never experienced unconditional love or just hate the world. I love my parents and my children, and I show that love through healthy demonstrations. I don't say that my child is zoo-like in any behavior (he isn't), nor do I creep around on floors so I can hold my adolescent son in my arms in the middle of the night. Label me unimaginative and negative; I know differently. The relationship portrayed in this book is peverse."
1,no,"i hate this book ... seriously, i do. it's not about incest or whatever, it's about death ... it's telling a little kid: ""hey, your mommy loves you a lot...and you love your mommy, right? well, shes going to die, and youre going to experience it."" is this something you want your kid thinking? ""my mommy loves me ... but someday she will be dead."" I read this as an adult and it left me feeling like crap, thinking about it still does."
5,I loved this book,"The other day I was at work (I work in a daycare with preschoolers and kindergartens.) and I decided to read one of the little girls a story. I was tired of all the seasonal books my supervisor picked out so I went over to a shelf and pick out this book because it had a cute cover. I proceeded to read this story and ended up almost in tears by the end. As a mother-to-be I thought this was an outstanding book and I want my children to know that i will always love them. (I probably won't rock them to sleep untill I die, however I did learn from my little sisters that even 11 year olds want to be rocked.)"
1,Scared the living daylights out of my child,"This was read during storytime at our library when my daughter was 5. While I thought the story of the mother obsessed with her child was funny (as did my daughter), when it came to the end and the allusion of the mother dying, quite a few of the children were upset. Including my daughter. She was anxiety ridden for a while after hearing this and no amount of talking, consoling or explaining on my part helped.While it is a silly, fun and sweet story of how a mother loves her child no matter what, I don't think this is a good book for young children. I agree with the suggestion of going with ""Guess How Much I Love You"""
1,Obsessive Mother Behavior,"My mohter in-law gave this book to my husband a few years ago and neither one of us read it until our babysitter was reading it to our baby last week and asked, ""Is this Darren?"" I was confused and then read the creepy book and realized why my obsessive mother in-law would've given this to her 28 year-old son. It is not a children's book. It is a book for crazy old ladies."
4,A very sweet message,"When reading this book for the first time at the book store, I admit that I got choked up. I wish I was certain that small children would focus on the same messages that brought that emotion and not things that they might find a tiny bit off-putting, but I gave it 4 stars for how it moved ME."
4,You will laugh so hard you will cry,"I got this as a shower gift when I had my son. The person that gave it to me said she read this to her daughter almost every day (when dd was little). I read it to my son (who is now 6) and I laughed so hard I cried. That book has one creepy mom in it. It is the most hilarious thing I have ever read to a kid (because it's super cheesey and weird). It's supposed to be sentimental and sweet, but I didn't take it that way. The first time I read it when my son was really small, my husband and I kept laughing at how ridiculous it was. It is super fun to read just for the laughs it gives me and my husband. Sorry to those who are sentimentally attached to the book. I don't mean disrespect to you."
1,An excerise in Munsch's warped mind,"I had to read this book for one of my field experiences. While the toddlers loved it and were laughing, I thought this book was horrible. It was explained to me (and also in some of the positive reviews here) that it's only a metaphor. I think that is too easy of a label to stick onto something in which the author, Robert Munsch,is so obviously disturbed. I think most people agree when the Mom (now an elderly lady) drives across town with a LADDER on top of her car it truly crosses a line.I would like to ask the people who think this book is only a harmlessmetaphor in love, would you still adore this book and give it fivestars and endless kudos if the gender roles were reversed?I could've given this book 'no stars', if that wasan option. When I have school librarians and PH.D's also postingwhy they dislike this book, then I know this so-called classicis really an exercise in the warped mind of the author."
1,Utterly strange and creepy!,"Wow. This book makes me cringe! What is supposed to be a loving relationship between a mother and son turns into a bizarre, creepy one that should send both of them to intensive therapy. I would never subject my kids to this nonsense."
1,"For adults, not kids","This book chronicles a woman cradling and chanting a poem to her ""baby"" as he grows from an infant to an adult. ""I love you for always, I love you forever, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be..."" or something like that. It ends with the man cradling his dying mother, chanting the same poem. This is the only book I've ever actually thrown in the trash, because I didn't want it read to my son. I want him to thrive for just a little while in the wonderful, happy world of childhood where there is no death, no guilt, no forcing of love. Give it to your graduating high school senior, if you like. Read it for yourself to make yourself cry. But PLEASE don't read to your toddler... I think it's filled with underlying love-guilt messages that are manipulative and confusing for a toddler."
1,Sicko Mom,"I'm sorry, but this book reaked. I mean I feel that the situations in the book carry motherly love just a little far. Maybe the writting is endearing to some. As for me I found this mother to be ""without a life"". It made it seem like all mothers do is live for their children with no independent life of their own. As much as I love my children (boy and girl), I wouldn't want to think of them as my baby for the rest of my life. I rejoice in sharing their growth and knowledge with the world. Maybe this mom and son live on a secluded island (planet) and neither realizes that there is indeed a real world where children do grow up and parents do lead their own lives. The part where she climbs through the window really made me sick. I asked myself ""what's wrong with this woman?"" Then I thought, ""Oh I get it. She climbs through the window because her son is so sick of her that he won't open the door"". My advice to all mother's, ""Get a life so your children will enjoy having one."""
2,The Diary of Joseph Plumb Martin a Revolutionary War Soldier,Many of Mr. Martin's tales were greatly simplied and lost there meaning. Even a book written for grade school students needs to show the hardships these men occurred during their fight for our independence. Pretty pictures with a major lack in developing the struggles of these soldiers.
4,one helluva movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"actually,its borderline brilliant.when this was 1st released,i didnt pay it any mind because im not a penelopy fan.then came vinella sky.as im writing this review,i have not gone to see it.now having seen this,i wont.as much as i like cam crowe and tom cruise,i cant see them improving this gem.i certainly dont want to see a rehash like that mockery of a remake''psycho''.this had me guessing all the way through and i was never bored.talk about a great premise.even when the secret is revealed,you are still waiting for another mindscrew.this is what movie making is(or should be)about.great idea/solid acting/NO RAPPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!/and no gratuitous use of music/special effects.leaving out rappers increases movies sucess by a trillion.lets hope this trend carries over to the USA!"
3,A good psychological thriller,"The story is well constructed and well told with very fine acting. The DVD does not contain a lot of bells and whistles, but I still recommend it.Now for the comparison between ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Vanilla Sky"". I don't see why anyone would like OYE better than VS because up until the final chapter, they're almost exactly alike.OYE is better in some ways and VS is better in others. The plot developments are explained slightly better in OYE than in VS, and I certainly loved the make-up job of the disfigured young man in OYE. But I prefer the animated acting in VS, and the final sequence in VS is a lot better than in OYE."
3,"Drugs, Drugs and more Drugs...","It was interesting to see Ben Stiller (and Owen Wilson for that matter) taking part in something so different from their usual and yet wonderful comedies.The plot of course revolves around drug addiction, so this not a movie for youngsters.Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Maria Bello, and the rest of the cast do a very good job with their performances, which are excellent to say the least!Aside from that, this is not so much an ""entertaining"" film as it is a window into the world of drugs, thus one needs to be in the proper (somber) mood to watch it as it does get to be graphic at times.Overall, Permanent Midnight is a movie worth watching, though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection. 3 Stars"
4,This is a very good movie,"I got this movie so that I will continue to improve on my Spainish. I am thrilled to find such good movie in the process. I have seen Vanillia Sky, but this is so much better, in some way much more original. The performances...what can I say, I stayed glued to the television until the end."
5,Nice to see the Spanish version...,The main actor inherited a chain of restaurants instead of a magazine company. Maybe that occupation has more prestige in their country. I heard the waitresses are more respected in Europe. It is a job with pride unlike USA. I enjoyed seeing the cultural differences. I already knew the story. The movies are almost identical story wise. You get to see Penelope's breasts like right in yhour face.
5,A Smart Girl's Guide to Friendship Troubles,It was a very helpful book. It had a lot of stories and gave many different perspectives about being friends and having friends. It could help with any friendship situation.
5,A SMART GIRLS GUIDE TO FRIENDSHIP TROUBLES,The art rocks!The story was great. But it was the illustration that I loved the most.
2,looks so much better in the package.,"Recently i've been looking to buy a cheap curling iron. i came across this one and thought vidal sassoon was a brand that's been around for a while. well. after ""curling"" my hair it just looked like i poorly straightend it. seriously. i am taking this back immediatly. don't waist your money or your time on this. maybe if you have thinner hair it would work. i dont know."
2,Book overrated,"This book is overrated. Many of the examples contain errors which will consume a lot of your time. I ended up spending more time figuring out where the mistakes were (in the descriptions of the examples or in the example themselves) than I did actual learning. While I do not doubt Joe's expertise in the subject I do find that he has difficulty explaining things. For me this book was a waste of time. A co-worker of mine has the 2nd edition, and the book is half the size of the 3rd edition. That version probably has a lot fewer mistakes and might be worth reading. As far as the 3rd edition, I threw mine in the trash."
4,River of Ruin,"I am not setting up to write a review- I like the author's works and think he can spin a taut yarn and because of that I keep coming back to his books. My question to the author is.....why did you leave Roddy hanging out there? Once he faxed the documents to Harry he was picked up by two ""Dangerous looking"" locals - he thought they might be Ex-Dignity Brigades......he was having end of life flashes on his wife and kids - the chapter ended but we were never told who these people were, what happened to him and how it came to be that he returned to the hotel. I then read the rest of the book expecting Roddy to betray his friends in one way or another....after all the last we saw of him he was being led away with ""vomit on is chin and the look of death in his eyes"". Or maybe I am missing something?!"
5,Great book for toddlers,"Of all Frank Asch's books, this is our four year old daughter's favorite. She responds very well to the humor of the situation and loves the idea of playing with the moon.Back when we first started reading to our daughter as a baby, she was very impatient and wouldn't sit for long stories. We were limited to board books that were very short and direct. Frank Asch's titles helped us show her that sitting for a whole story was worthwhile. Now she'll sit for much longer titles, but the whole Moon Bear series are still favorite re-reads!"
2,"Disappointed, these aren't reusable","I thought these ties could be reopened like some other ones I have. Oh well, they were still pretty cheap."
4,Easy to use,"The Mio is easy to up-load with the required data and very reliable in keeping time and reading your pulse. The only problem is while working out, the sweat on your wrist makes it a little difficult to get a quick read on your pulse."
5,Mio heart rate monitor,I am very happy with my purchase of the Mio heart rate monitor. I always wear one when I'm working out and I seem to go through a couple a year. I work out 4 to 5 times a week and often wear this instead of a watch. I would recommend this product.
1,what a lame journey this is,"Boring bar piano music, although it's better than most of ""old fart"" style music there are some jazz elements here. And the msuic doesn;t sound like it belongs on an elevator, I should give it two stars, but i won't. It doesn't really swing."
3,A virtual shopping spree,"Having leafed through this book and ""Great Leap Forward,"" I find myself bemused as to what all the fuss is about. Koolhaas is apparently oh so cool! according to a recent Newsweek. There is little that is new here unless one considers placing an escalator inside Le Corbusier's Dom-ino skeleton novel. It seems that Koolhaas and his chums have once again had great fun cutting and pasting from the past and present, to create a virtual tour through their cluttered minds of consumerist fantasies."
3,Aladdin's Magic Lamp Review,"I have seen the translated English version on VHS when I was a kid years ago and I remember liking it as I was just a kid. I saw this on DVD and thought I would see it again thinking it would be the same version. It's the same movie with the same actors the only thing that's different is that it has been updated and has a new English translation with different voice actors than the VHS version. So if you're looking for the old VHS version on DVD than this is not it because it doesn't exist. Plus, the new voice actors seem too exagerrated and ruin some of the charactors kind of making them seem fake."
2,Spend money to save money,"I must agree with the previous reviewer - the full four volume set is an essential purchase; this edition is not. Lacking in pre-Norman invasion history (I read the stuff on Roman Britain in about ten minutes, which really isn't enough considering the importance of this period to the island's history, as well as that of its offshoots) and skewed towards American material when available (there's lots of material on the civil war - funny that, given Commager's previous efforts), this volume doesn't do justice to Churchill's marvellous volumes.As for the book itself, whilst the underlying historiography of Churchill's history may no longer be fashionable (it's a bit too conservative for my liking), the quality of the writing more than makes up for such deficiencies."
4,The First Novel by the Author of Eureka St,"I read this novel after reading ""Eureka St."" which I loved for the characters and the writing. The writing is definetly here in ""Ripley Bogle,"" and the character, if not as joyful as before, is still here. The novel is very different, it tends more towards the darker side of the human soul. Having said that though, it was fascinating to read as the character continues to descend into the depth of depravity while you continue to cheer for him. The character is just that charming. I would recommend this book, but I would also advise reading ""Eureka St."" to get a full appreciation of the abilities of the author."
4,Remarkably heartfelt and moving,"Banana Yoshimoto's first effort consists of two stories, each of which deals with loss. In the first, ""Kitchen,"" a young woman loses her family and is invited to stay with an acquaintance and his ""mother"" (who had been the father prior to getting a sex change). The second story deals with a young woman whose lover has died far too young. Yoshimoto's stories are simple, heartfelt tales of emotion told in a deceptively simple style. Lurking beneath the surface, however, is a passion and honesty that is welcome and powerful. She writes with Japan as a background, but the emotions and situations she describes are universal and strike an immediate chord. I highly recommend this book."
4,Kick A** old school blues.,"After two mediocre live CDs (Archive Alive, Live at the Bottom Line) this disc proves Kim Simmonds can still jam with the best of them. Most of the tunes are up-tempo blues with blistering and thoughtful guitar. New vocalist Nathanial Peterson (he's actually been touring as a member of SB for the last 3 or so years... I saw him live a couple of years back) is authentic and moving. At times he is even reminiscent of Chris Youlden (check out ""Ain't no need to worry'). Not a bad cut on the disc."
4,Endust for electonics,Seems to work well & in a small easily manageable size. I use it on my spectacles as well as my phone & laptop.
1,where is ''descent''?,I like all the songs on this album. Unforgiveable that they left descent off. They could of easily added that as a 13th song on this compilation. What a rip-off!
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I used to buy correcting pens at the grocery store that included polish remover in the handle. So you just opened the top and started cleaning up the edges of your nails. This product did not have polish remover included. It is simply a pen with a removable tip and can be dipped in polish remover. Still works, just an extra step so less portable since you have to carry along a bottle of remover. They also sell the replaceable tips here so I'll be able to make use of this for years to come."
4,Some Kind of Magic!!,"This a magical book, full of warm hearted humor and just a little bit of a mystery to keep the book interesting. One of the best part is the relationship between the two men who survived the plane crash. Who is who? Ms. Weir does not let that secret out but throws hints about Dylan that could go either way. The ending is unusual as to what happens to Daniel French and Trevor Davis. I truly enjoyed every minure of reading this book."
5,An informed and informative guide to all that the use of steroids will effect in the life and body of the user,"The Steroid Deceit: A Body Worth Dying For? by Jeff Rutstein is an informed and informative guide to all that the use of steroids will effect in the life and body of the user. In The Steroid Deceit the reader will find much great detailing on national statistics, psychological reasoning, and preventative action. The book's invaluable content follow the guidelines of ""Why do teenagers really use steroids?"", ""How do they obtain steroids?"", ""What are the warning signs of steroid use?"", and ""How do you get teenagers to recognize the real dangers of steroids?"". The Steroid Deceit is critically important and very highly recommended reading -- especially for parents and athletically active teenagers."
2,Flaky,"Watch goes into different modes with having any buttons pushed then refuses to go into a mode you want, such as heart-rate metering mode, when you do press the button. Works some times, but I only use when I exercise. Too flaky to use all the time."
4,MIO HR Monitor,"Worked very well out of the box. Sometimes needs one or two tries if you are resting. Works much better when wet from sweat (when you really need it). Easy to program, very reliable and accurate (checked it against my chest monitor. Would definitely recommend."
2,mio review,this watch is not as good as its description...i think if your realy serious about training then you should go for a good watch like timex or higher. the looks are not very good. you need to press a button to get heart rate and hold it for 8 seconds ...if your hand slips of it which it does ...u hav to start all over which is annoyn . i have a timex which is way way better than this one. and this watch is also inaccurate in its readings
1,Worthless,"This product is a real POS. You have to stop and stand still to use. It took about 20 tries to get a reading. I got so disgusted that I used a hammer to remedy the situation. I couldn't return it anyway...but I sure felt better. Why do manufacturers of any products sell junk?? Is it because they don't rely on repeat business or think people won't write or read reviews?? I own a business and I don't let anything go until it is 100%. The makers of this watch tested it(or not) but just didn't care about whether it performed, only that it sold."
4,GRAT WATCH,II/30/09THE WATCH HAS BEEN DOING EVERYTHING IS WAS SUPPOSE TO DO WITHNO PROBLEMS.PS IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND SETKEVIN
2,Pulse rate does not always work,"I bought this and could not get to work, afer about 10 tries I got a bad reading then 3 good then 10 no readings. This was just sitting still. I had my son try it and it worked first 2 times he tried. I went for 15 min walk and got 3 good readings."
1,heart rate monitor doesen't work,"I don't like the watch. The heart rate monitor never worked for me, came with bad battery, buttons/navigation are not user friendly, sometime just reset everything (even the time) to zero... I recommend not to buy this watch."
1,disappointed,took awhile to recieve the watch. first battery was dead and it came with another battery and that also was dead. not too happy.
1,not helpful,I was disappointed in the sound of the timer since most of the time it isn't audible if you are exercising. The HRM is OK as it is hard to get a reading while exercising. The band is plastic and I am sure will get very smelly. I am returning it.
2,mio zone plus watch,"This unit work by getting your pulse from your fingertips. I did not have much luck getting a reading consistently so I did return the item. I really had trouble getting a reading while I was moving, but even when still, it often took several tries to get a read."
4,Bob Dylan World Tours 1966-1974,"Joel Gilbert's new film; Bob Dylan World Tours 1966-1975, Through the Camera of Barry Feinstein, revolves around his journey to Woodstock N.Y. and Greenwich Village in an attempt to unearth someof the mystery surrounding the period of time Bob Dylan lived there. In a series of very candid interviews with people and personalities close to Dylan at this time; including lengendary photographer Barry Feinstein; we find ourselves with a clearer picture of Dylan by the film's conclusion.I would consider Joel Gilbert's new film an absolute ""must"" for any fan of Bob Dylan; while anyone with an interest in phtography will find that Barry Feinstein's photographs are simply mesmerizing! A joy to view over and over again."
4,A piece of the puzzle,"If you are expecting concert footage or interviews with Bob or Sara or Joan then you are going to be disappointed here. What this carefully constructed documentary will do is paint a portrait of what it was like being around Bob Dylan during one of the most intensely creative and hyper periods of his creative life. Between very candid interviews with people who had intimate friendships and creative partnerships with Dylan from the time he hit the Village right through a European tour, his motorcylce accident, etc., Gilbert et al. weave a picture that captures a part of one of the more elusive creatures of our era, and perhaps the greatest song-writer, poet of the 20th century. A must for every serious member of the Dylan legions roaming the planet."
1,"Please watch if you have no talent, but think of making a movie or writing a book","Horrendous filming. No story, even though it showcases wonderful pictures and talented people. How much of an ego do you have to have to release such a boring and talentless film?"
3,"it's ok..not great, but ok","Followed instructions and it seemed ok...there were water spots after treatment and squeege. After second shower, even more water spots."
1,Same thing happened to me,My Haier dehumidifier also stopped working after a bit over a year and out of warranty. Couldn't even find anyone to fix it and suspected it would cost too much anyway. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER HAIER PRODUCT AGAIN.
4,Placebo or valid science?,"I dunno. Either way, this thing puts me out like a light. The visuals are definitely much more than an afterthought...more Pixar than Atari... and the sounds are very soothing & enjoyable. A little new agey for sure, but whether the binauaral audio & ""frequency follow response"" flickering goads my noodle into alpha/theta or not, this stuff makes me calmer than a hindu cow... 4 vouches. I recommend."
4,Pretty good for the price - great for rugs,"I normally buy All to use when I'm washing something like bathroom rugs. I don't normally use it very much in my clothes because I don't think that it does as good of a job as Tide. It's okay in a pinch, but it has trouble removing odors from clothing such as exhaust from a lawnmower (ours mixes gas with oil and blows the exhaust all over my husband. Lovely smell, huh?), or workout clothes. Other than that, it's a nice product and supremely better than Dynamo!"
5,"Waylon Jennings, Awesome",Waylon has a unique style and much versatility that shows in his music.All songs are well written and a must listen to appeal.RIP Waylon.
5,Great cord,This is a very thick an tough cord that looks like it will last a very very long time. I am using 2X 50 foot cords an have made pigtails to run 220V (don't try this at home disclaimer here) an this cord does it very well. I can pull a continues 20A at 100 feet with no problems. This is the best extension cords I have ever owned an i have owned contractor cords before. I am sold on this brand an all my cords will be from this manufacture from now on.
5,Well built cord!,This thing is a beast. No worries about the ends coming apart as the cord is one molded piece of thick insulation. I foresee it lasting for many years.
1,Shipped Wrong Product,"Ordered Dell compatible (311-0410) Viking DL 1664P 128 MB PC 100 CL3. Vendor shipped wrong item and so far, dealing with Viking is a nightmare."
3,Initial impressions not great,I like the idea but after waiting a month to get this I was surprised at how heavy it was. I weighed it and with the sheath it is nearly 1.75 pounds which doesn't sound like a lot but in my backpack ounces count. It was easy enough to set up and take down. Now I haven't used it with a fire yet but did test the top for stability and it is not too stable on top. The 4 prongs don't lay flush so you either have to hold your cup/pot or try and bend them to make them a bit more flat they had a curve to them.I plan on taking this out within the next few weeks and will report back on how well it actually does in the field. Hope this helps. Until next time. Cheers!
2,"it is very small, more like a toy","it is very small, more like a toy. It might be good to set it up in your backyard and show your son how to start a small fire."
3,Works but is a sooty mess,"Length:: 1:47 MinsThe cooker was cheap, compact and easy to use but does have it's drawbacks."
2,bland flavor,The service from BeverageGourmet was excellent. The flavor of the mango however was horrible. It tastes nothing like real mango.
4,Review of Signet's 'Dorian Gray',"The introduction is expansive and insightful. This edition has a few additional stories, which gives it something more than similar texts. My only complaint is the physical book itself, which is a small, tough little bulldog of a paperback. It's nothing out of the ordinary for a cheap paperback, I'm merely remarking on my frustration with the thing."
3,Ne m'enterrez pas encore,"Je n'ai pas encore ecouté tout l'album. Mon mari est mort depuis 10 jours et il a choisi ce chanon pour son mémoire. C'est un grande aide pour moi qu'il a choisi ce chanson, parce qu'il vive dans mon mémoires.J'espère que ce chanon peuve aidez des autres dans son désespoire."
5,Really great song!,I really enjoy hearing the new Backstreet Boys song. I like the way each member gets a chance to sing. The harmonies are great and the all-around sound is impressive.
2,Sounds too much like their old stuff,"I think that Bsb really needs to improve on there songs if they plan to stick around, this song sounds just like there old stuff, and is pretty confusing. What is this song really about? I also feel that they could really use some new producers, there beats sound cheap and remind me of teeny boppers !!!!!"
3,Not THAT good,"This is not an excellent song for me. I only like it a lot because it is sung by the Backstreet Boys, who usually sing songs that are way more boring than this."
3,good looking but too big,i love these shades but they dont fit on my face. you need a good nose in order to hold up these heavy set of sunglasses.
1,Do not waste your money!! VERY misleading item,"Don't be decieved by the big round comfy cushion this girl is laying on in this picture. It is absolutely not an accurate portrayal of the product. This product is basically a large throw pillow you can get at Target or Wallmart, not the large pillow pictured. Talk about deceiving advertising! IF you are looking for a large cushion for your kids to hang out on this is NOT it. Don't waste your money. The product is no better than anything at a discount store. In fact, I got higher quality from a discount store."
3,Excellent world-building and writing--unfocused plot.,"I pretty much concur with the other reader's raves--this is a very fine piece of epic, worldbuilding SF. Zindell's writing is miles ahead of most of the genre's writers. The book's structure has some problems, however--it reads like two or three tacked-together short novels, and not much happens for long stretches of pages towards the middle and end. Also, I must point out the book's similarities to Gene Wolfe's ""Book of the New Sun."" Zindell uses several similar devices in the same way as that extraordinary work, and it bothered me. But don't take my word for it--read them both."
2,Not as good as I would have hoped.,"I'm a musician who's on a big ""mass kick"" lately, and I'm a big fan of most of Maslanka's works. When I found out he had written a mass, I was REALLY excited. I'm afraid, however, that I was disappointed. This really isn't the best of Maslanka's work."
5,"Can you say, ""gouging""""?","I purchased this LP on vinyl in the early 80's, and recorded it to cassette. I surrendered both forms of media a long time ago, and find these sellers gouging a price that is typically reserved for collectibles. Hey, I understand the notion of markets and demand, but these prices are predatory."
4,Good but not THAT good,"Great album with classics, ""Red Clay,"" ""Spain,"" and ""New York Afternoon"" -- though, one of my favorites is ""Joy!"" which nobody ever seems to notice. But the ransom some of these sellers are trying to get for the CD ($74-$115) is just TOO STUPID!"
5,Who knew....,You always hear about the fourteeners of Colorado. I had no clue there were so many thirteeners! Very informative. Looking forward to using this often.
1,Cheap is right,"Unfortunately you get what you pay for. This item is not worth it. In any manner. Only preexisting data can be copied to the drive. Any time you try to create a new file on the drive it corrupts. The only way to clear the now huge file (a 3kb file becomes something on the order of 1gb) is to reformat the drive.If all you need is a low-level-of-importance data transfer device then this is perfect, but don't be surprised to find corruption."
1,Consider other books first,"If you already know precalculus at the level of a college professor, this may be the book for you. Vital steps for completing problems are omitted, explanations are not given for processes that must be understood. Definitions of new terms are not given, forcing the student to reference another book or go to the web."
2,Poor quality sound!,Sound quality very poor. Not up to the usual Sinatra standards of CD's. If I had known this I would not have purchased!!
4,"Easy, effective, if unattractive","It does all it's supposed to do: it holds a week's worth of compost for a family of four, is easy to open with one hand, and traps all odors. It shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition. Minus one star for being freakin' ugly. Keep it in a cupboard and feel good about being green."
3,Ordinary Decent Criminal,It's a good movie if you are a Kevin Spacey fan. It is interesting that this movie is based on a Michael Lynch who existed and did what he did.
3,Makes great shadows,I've had these now for a couple of yearsSome pros and cons:First the cons:1) They don't last forever. Most of them die after a few months of use. I had eight and now I am down to two.2) They are very hard to put in place. The wires seem like they float. The suction cups are hard to put down and lose their suction after just a couple of months. The spots are hard to position.The Pros:1) Once you get them in position they look great. I put a couple of them together next to an air stone and that made a great effect.2) They create amazing shadows on your walls. They're like little color spot lights in your tank. Not on purpose I pointed a rear spot out toward the front onto the ceiling. We were just hanging around in the dark room for a kids sleep over and then we saw a GIANT shadow of one of the fish on the ceiling. That was really cool but scared the crap out of the kids.
4,Very good introduction to what an EA is all about,"Definitely a book to read to understand what an Enterprise architecture is and how to develop one. The book provides a step-based approach to get you to the point where a company can define its EA and how to evolve it. If you are looking for technical details you are in the wrong place. But if rather you want to understand the business benefits, then I doubt you'll find something easier to read on this subject."
4,"Good, but not great.","Fans of FoS should have this in their library.Everyone else can skip it and pick up their album:The Best of A Flock of Seagulls, since most of their big hits appear on their other two releases anyway. Not bad if you need a Seagull fix though. (should be 3 not 4 stars)Pure 80's new wave big hair synth-pop."
4,Does its job,"This set is exactly what I needed to keep my stepdaughter's DS stuff together in one (organized) place. Everything works perfectly; it does, however, look kind of generic. She's young enough that she doesn't care. It depends on how picky the DS owner is, I guess."
5,Fantastic Value!!!,"For the price I paid for this kit ($5.95), this is a real fantastic value.It is all pink. Not Nintendo brand.- I got a set of screen protectors- car battery charger- a stylus pen (with a bigger lifesize pen adapter if you prefer)- a travel bag. The bag itself is great- earbuds - not that great, just OK- gamecase for 9 cartridges. Protected by thick silicone rubber pads.- and cleaning kitWoaaa...that's value for your money."
5,happygirl,it's nice to have all these accessories packaged together so you don't have to run around buying them separately!
4,"pink, but don't wimp out","It's so ""girly"" but at least it's cheaper.It you're not afraid of using pink acsessories, buy this instead.This doesn't work with DSi ( like I thought it might? ) But will suit my DS lite as a backup.A real man doesn't care what color his charger is,his masculinity comes from inside, and is unaffected by the color of plastic ;-)>"
5,Webb's Best Book Yet.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read it, now. It came to me at a time when I needed it to. Things like that happen in the land of the mysterious. I look forward to more mysterious mysteries from Don Webb."
4,Summer tries to escape her disco connection,"Still trying to distance herself from her disco days, Donna Summer's ""She Works Hard for the Money"" has more in common with 1981's ""I'm a Rainbow"" than it does the singer's classic '70's albums, as well as the Quincy Jones-produced album from 1982. Like ""Rainbow"", ""...Money"" is more pop-oriented and achieves a margin of success.Summer is good on the title cut, ""Woman"", ""Unconditional Love"", ""Tokyo"", ""People People"", and the touching ballad ""Love Has a Mind of its Own"" (sharing lead vocals with Matthew Ward).Unfortunately, the record-buying public still had such strong memories of Summer in her heyday. Though successful, ""She Works Hard for the Money"" paled in sales comparison to the likes of ""Bad Girls"" or ""Live and More.""It's too bad that Madonna - who was going to take the world by storm in a couple - would be the one that patterned ""reinvention.""Summer did her best to do just the same."
4,Historical romance,"A bit different than I am used to reading Kenyon's work. This one is obviously one of her first novels. Interesting story, solid couple if a bit formula. Good read for a rainy day."
5,A Good Movie Can Be Propaganda.,"I found this documentary to be very moving and very informative. I whole heartedly recommend it to everyone. However, I admit that it is a one-sided piece of ""propaganda."" Whenever a person believes in something they are naturally going to be biased. I believe that it is often better to simply go with being biased than to create a phony attempt at being balanced. The most insidious propaganda is when someone makes such a film and believes that they are unbiased when in reality their work is slanted in a subtle manner. The best way for any intelligent person to see all sides of an issue is to read or view the work of people who come at the issue from all the different sides. Basically, if you subscribe to The Nation, and you want to be open minded, subscribe to National Review as well."
5,Values and Courage,"Phenomenal production!It not only portrays Reagan's admirable values and character, which most of today's politicians need to emulate, but it clearly establishes our how we must behave in order to conquer our current Beast, the Islamic fascists.This should be a required viewing for all Americans, especially those who are too young to remember that period and are those vacillating as what we should do about the current Beast."
2,Point Is?.....,"Is another compilation necessary? The only difference between this and the Least Worst Of album is the mediocre cover of Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"".Obviously a good listen, seeing as it's the band's famous songs, but uninspired nonetheless. If you can, buy and download ""Highway Star"" by itself, because it's not worth the price of the whole CD."
4,A sad and touching story...,"I am not much for 'romantic' films but seeing this was based on Robert E. Howard I had to watch it. It is very well paced drama and all the acting is top notch. The only flaw I see with the movie is a bit mroe on the realtion between Robert and his mother... but that is not the focus of the film, so is forgivable. Very touching film and something I would buy if it came out on DVD."
4,A fine Texan love story,"The character she plays in THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD is my favourite role of Ms Zellweger's, apart from that of her NURSE BETTY. My favourite role of Mr D'Onofrio is the quite central one he plays in FULL METAL JACKET but his playing in THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD is invested with considerable intelligence and he does a superb job among a great team of actors in this film. Mr Ireland does a sterling job of maintaining tone and allows the work to unfold at a pace appropriate to the classic scenario of a mother not willing to let go an only son, and a lover not willing to wait until she does. A piquant and refreshing change from sentimental pap and Hollywood formula."
5,The Whole Wide World,"This is for the passionate fan of anything R.E.Howard , as in , if you don't know what R.E. stands for don't bother with this film.It is beautifully filmed and acted by D'Onofrio and Zellweiger, and captures the moment in his life as he clutches to his dreams in a most bittersweet endgame.He was the Father of the Heroic Fantasy and his life was an homage to the original Doomed Hero of Greek Tragedy.Not for the lighthearted. Gregory K. Tobkes, East Meadow, NY."
4,Know the Back Story,I saw this because I'm a huge D'Onofrio fan. I was put off at first by his strange demeanor. But eventually I was enthralled and couldn't stop watching. It's almost like a train wreck when you just can't look away. The end is the clincher.I knew nothing about the story but the movie drove me to find out more. It's based on a true story. The woman waited until she was in her 70's to write about this. The man is indeed the author of the Conan the Barbarian stories. Just knowing this little bit made the story that much better to me.I found D'Onofrio irritating at times so maybe that's why everyone else thinks he acted it so well. I hate thinking of him as irritating but I got over it in the end.A-
1,"An Awful, Trashy Abortion of a Little Film","This is a tedious, throw-away, generic abortion of a romance movie that made me wish I had rather been cleaning my cats' litter box. The film's premise, that a woman tries to deal with a fellow who has difficult idiosyncracies, could have been handled deftly in someone else's hands, but here it comes across as profoundly and excitingly as the wallpaper that counts as film on the Lifetime Channel."
4,Caught it on Cable - big Robert E. Howard Fan,"I had wanted to see this movie for a while as I am a Big Robert E. Howard fan - Conan, Solomon Kane, etc.I had also enjoyed COLD MOUNTAIN which had the same two stars - Vincent D'Onfrio and Rene Zellwiger - but not in the same scenes.It was a diverting movie with good performances and spectacular scenery. My wife wound up watching it with me. I do think that D'Onfrio overacted a bit as he was also the producer. Zellwiger gave a fantastic performance.It was NOT much for Conan fans but did have a few scenes in which D'Onfrio acted out scenes from his writing which were interesting.It is great if you are a fan of Howard, the 2 stars and also like your romance to be simple"
2,do not get if representing yourself!,I thought this would be a step by step guide for those in pro se cases.representing them selves. It is not like that at all! This book is geared to those with a lawyer. It was useless to me i left it at.a starbucks because it would have cost more to return it :-(
3,The band is solid and it's nice to see Doug and Darren back together again...(read on pls...),"But I'd have rather seen them back on theFIELD together like with the B.C. Lionsback in '91, in the CFL. Darren andDoug do well here and the other NON-Fluties give it that good old fashiontry. A collectors item for sure. ButTerry Bradshaw singing is better!"
1,"Great scent, but the bottle pictured is not even close to the size you get","This scent from Gucci is very crisp and clean with a slight citrus overtone. It has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Great for summertime.A couple of major gripes here though. The bottle I recieved was very , very tiny - not at all like the photo above. I should have known better, and didn't pay attention to the words that said 5ML. 5 ML is a small amount. The bottle is smaller than my thumb! Also, shipping was much slower than normal Amazon standards."
3,Good Hangers,Nothing fancy. Good basic wood hangers. Sturdy and a good color. A step up from plastic especially for dress shirts. I would recommend something beefier for suits
2,"Shake it up, baby!","This is a reissue of the Isley Brothers 1962 album ""Twist & Shout!"" Unlike most albums from that time period, it doesn't include a lot of cover versions of recents hits by other perfomers, other than ""Let's Twist Again"" (which, bizarrely, is featured in an instrumental version). Unfortunately, the original compostions here are sometimes not very original. ""Hold On Baby"" and ""You Better Come Home"" are rewrites of ""Twist and Shout"" ""Spanish Twist"" is an instumental version of ""Twist and Shout"". ""Twist and Shout"", ""Rubberleg Twist"", ""Twistin' With Linda"" and ""Nobody But Me"" are the only really good songs here. Everything else is pretty forgetable. On the plus side, the remixing job here is excellent. It has very good stereo sound, especially considering the time period it was recorded in."
1,Tie Holder,"Disappointing. Why does not some one make a tie holder that does not have to be folded. I bought one a Dunhill several decades ago, but they are no longer in stock. The foldover type crushes the neckties and creases the fabric. I use it now by not closing it, but this has its disadvantages."
2,Product does not perform,"Like others I used this as directed and the results were poor, a mild lightening at best. I did not want to purchase another bottle to try scrubbing the product in as the company suggests on your second attempt. My suggestion would be to try something else or try scrubbing this product on the concrete the first time. The only appeal of this product to me was you pour and it does the work, which did not prove to be the case."
3,HDMI video output non-operational,"The new receiver arrived, and there was no HDMI video output, so it had to be taken to an authorized Pioneer service center to be repaired before it was useable. They replaced the HDMI circuit board and adjusted it, so it is working now."
4,Great for beginner,This is a nice at home routine for a beginner. I love Rachel McLish and was expecting something a bit more challenging but it was ok. I use it occasionally on a rainy day when I can't get outside.
1,waste of money,"I have tried this kit on numerous cd and dvd discs and not once has it managed to repair any of them (the scratches weren't even deep, they were barely visible). If I'd tried rubbing the discs with washing up liquid using very cheap toilet paper I might have had more luck."
4,OK Book,Very good book for interracial dating advice by the way if your looking for an interracial relationship your may want to try Matchinterracial or some of the other sites that cater to interracial dating
5,Does a great job,"Helped my wife's heel spur go away!!!! I have also used this product for years. They work great, the best inserts I have ever ran into to!!!"
1,Buyer beware,"Tammy writes: My husband ordered these inserts in March, 2005. In June, 2005, the order was processed and we received these inserts. By this time, forget it; we returned them following the exact instructions in the invoice and using their own return label. USPS reported delivery on 07/01/05 and as of today, 07/21/05, the refund has not been processed. Customer service (once I finally reached someone!) said a refund was not in process because the time for a refund had expired since the order was placed in March!!! I argued the point and was finally given a contact person and phone number in Refund Dept. I cannot get anyone to answer the phone in that department. What a mess!"
2,"ow, my achin' feet","Not for me. These were most uncomfortable. I have very high arches, so maybe that was the problem, but really, how can these feel good for anyone? I followed the instructions but I couldn't stand the pain these produced. I tried to give them to my sister who has flat feet, and she gave them back because they hurt her, too. By then it was too late to return them for a refund."
1,dead product,The product came DOD ( dead on delivery). Looks like nobody's checking a product before shipping. Will return it back for refund. Very unhappy :((((
5,Bad Karma is a cool paranormal suspense!,"I am a fan of Theresa Weir's thrillers published under the name Anne Frasier and was excited to read a rerelease from her romantic suspense career. From page one, I was captured by Weir's exceptional ability to grab the reader with entertaining characters and couldn't stop turning the pages. She sets a distinct spin on a woman's psychic ability that keeps the reader guessing, with individuals who are uniquely imperfect.Daniel Sinclair and Cleo Tyler deal with painful secrets, and are portrayed with a honesty that is refreshingly different. These are characters you find yourself rooting for until the very end. Bad Karma is a cool paranormal suspense with killer description and awesome characterization. I hope to read more Theresa Weir books in the future!"
4,A different but great book,"I enjoyed reading about these quirky, imperfect characters and finished the book in one day. Ms. Weir gives us an offbeat, but not stupid, sense of humor to handle the problems the characters were dealing with. The book was wonderful."
2,Bridge For Dummies,"Very difficult to understand. Found it to be a complete waste. Have since been told you can't learn bridge from a book, so I am taking bridge lessons. I just wish someone had told me before I wasted my money. This book is certainly not for beginners."
1,Bad quality!!!,"i got the bag 10 months ago for my birthday. it has been falling apart, the cord is shreading and the zipper just broke today. i am suprised and dissapointed by the quality. i begin to suspect that maybe this is not the real Prada bag.maybe the company could advice me where i can repair/exchange the bag. thank you."
1,disappointed,"The inkjet pack is a disappointment.Its colors are faded,and pictures come out with lines as if it were the end of a cartridge.The last one before this was very good."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I only used the ink - it came in package of two- color and black - for three weeks. At the end of three weeks I was getting lines in my pictures and now it won't print at all. I keep getting a blinking light next to the on button and a message that the cartridge on the right does not belong to this printer ?? I used it three weeks so I don't know what happened now.HP21/22 Ink Cartridge, Combo Pack"
2,Typical Ink,"These are typical HP ink cartridges. They don't last very long... But the price was right. Ink, in my opinion, is always too expensive and isn't enough bang for your buck. But, here, it was slightly cheaper than the store."
4,me gusta,de verdad son muy responsables los recomiendo a todas aquellas personas que se atrevan y concreten sus ofertas muy agradecidogracias y saludos
3,Es muy poca!,"Si van a imprimir fotografias, no es bueno comprar este modelo de tinta. Es mejor elegir los numeros 56 y 57 que rinden mucho mas!"
3,HP21/22 Printer Cartridges,"I have bought this item twice. The black cartridge works fine. Both times the color cartridge would not print anything in blue. ""Blue items print out in a reddish color."
5,Great service,I received my order quickly. The expriation date on the ink was a good year away. Everything was in good condition.Original HP 21/22 Ink Cartridges Combo-Pack in Retail Packaging
3,Ran out too quickly,Seems like this ink went really quickly and the cartridge was not able to be refilled not sure what went wrong.
1,AAAAGGGGGHHH,"I haven't bought the album. I only listened to samples of the first two songs. If I couldn't turn it off, I would have to jam icepicks into my ears to make it stop."
2,Loaded with bugs - do not buy!,"It looks like a good program at first but it is so full of bugs that I advise you not to buy it. Customer service is practically non-existent. I am stuck with a 60$ program that doesn't work. They tried to blame the problem on Apple but the box said it was built for OS X so that is a weak argument. I would never have bought it if it hadn't had that ""built for OS X"" on the box. This software is nothing but bad news. This is the same company that sells Omnioutliner, a 20$ program that does nothing but stick in checkmarks and bullets in your lists. They also try to sell Omniweb, their own browser, which does nothing that Safari doesn't do better."
2,"Has its moments, but dated","Diskettes in 2011? This book would probably have been 4-stars back in 95' when it won the Nebula. Unfortunately, this book does not stand the test of time. I almost put this down 2/3 of the way through for being too cheesy, but I'm glad I finished it. The story is kind of cool, but it could have been so much better. The main character is too perfect, aside from his judgemental snootiness. And his life is just too convenient, I mean, you're in another city, call an old friend who just happens to have nothing better to do than join you for lunch? And that's not the only thing...the world really does revolve around Peter Hobson, everything is so easy for him. Scientific inventions that go right the first time? POOF, it's like magic isn't it? Nope. Just in this book. Cookie cutter cops, lame dialogue, ancient Web technologies. This book did make me think though...about how much better it could've been."
2,Moral homilies hiding as Sci-Fi,"The only thing impressive about this book are the awards it has somehow accumulated. The writing style was OK, but the science and psychology was definately lacking - overly simplistic and convenient. But what bothered me the most was the thinly veiled and clumsy anti-humanism allegory. I like stories that explore and question various moral and ethical situations and dilemmas - I don't like being hit over the head with them. For interesting allegories, read Nancy Kress or Valerie Freireich. This book felt to me like one of the more saccherine ""Outer Limits"" episodes, where a questionable but nevertheless interesting premise is shallowly explored and sweetly resolved"
4,My enemy the queen,"This book is a great incite into the times of elizabeth the first. Written from the perspective of Elizabeths cousin, this was an honest, enlightening and interesting book. It has certainly got me gripped on the British monarchys history. Elizabeth is seen to be a domineering, spoilt person but yet extremely loyal to friends, family and her favourite servants. She is torn between the love of the charming Robert Dudley and her obsession not to have to share her crown."
3,Poorly Finished,"Piano is great construction and keys, but finish is poor. First piano shipped had bubbles in the black pain finish. Replacement piano has bare spots where the finish did not get applied. Gave up and kept the second piano as it was a Christmas gift. It is a big hit with the kids, but I am disappointed in the finish on this product."
1,Rip Off,"Can anyone now just replicate a title at home - Disney, say - and sell it for ""Home Use""?DVD-Rs won't play on most DVD players, anyway. So watch out."
3,Shame on Kultur,"Why do we on this side of the atlantic have to pay for those incompetents at Kultur. In England, this DVD was made by Opus Arte, in France it was F1 and in Germany it was Arthaus. All of their DVDs of this opera have removable subtitles in several languages, interviews with Alagna, Pappano and Gheorghiu and most important, PCM and DTS sound.What do we get here? No interviews, fixed english subtitles and incredibly, Dolby 2.0 sound!!! It reminds me of the very first opera DVDs 6 years ago!It's a real shame since the singing and acting is excellent, as is the music direction by Pappano. But all we're left with is an excellent production with a mediocre sound and no usual DVD options.Shame on Kultur...!!!"
2,INVACARE substitution for SURGILUBE,"I ordered 'SURGILUBE' but was sent 'INVACARE' which I don't like at all. Invacare does not come out of the tube smoothly and uniformly like 'SURGILUBE' does. Please never again substitute Invacare. Thank you, Fred."
4,Only two hands?,"I defy anyone to listen to ""Pixie"" and be convinced only one man is playing. Unless that one man is the legendary James Booker. Not unlike Nina Simone in his way of combining classical elements into jazz and R+B, Booker is as good as it gets for New Orleans-style piano. When he sings ""Junco Partner"", its with a voice that rings all too true. Great stuff."
2,Very cheap sign... even cheaper quality.,"Pros:The sign looks better than the picture in the description.It is visible from a distance.Cons:Very cheap metal, feels like 5 layers of tinfoil smashed together.Do not expect a quality sign, it's printed on the thinnest sheet metal money can buy."
3,Good finish and visibility. A bit flimsy.,"The sign is exactly what you see. It is very clear, with high contrast colors and easy-to-read font. Just one problem. It is absolutely impossible to have this sign mounted on a pole / wooden stick / pipe. It is extremely flimsy, requiring a solid substrate for mounting, such as a wall, or a plywood board. That was not my plan of use, since I wanted to add it to the pole holding alarm company sign by my driveway. Now I have to come up with some plywood backing for this sign, or simply order a different one that can hang on its own."
5,private property no trespassing sign,aluminum sign meant to keep out trespassers and anyone else not wanted on your property great sign easy to hang up or place anywhere on your property
1,A little disappointed,"First of all I must commend Barbara Thompson and her long road to success with WLS, as well as the courage it takes to discuss this very personal matter in such a public forum. However, if you are looking for a book that focuses on factual medical answers to the tough questions you may have about WLS, then this is not the book for you. This book is a light read, easily finished in an evening. Often I found many of Ms. Thompson's answers to commonly asked questions lacking in research or based solely on her personal experience, which is great for a look at personal testimony about what she went through but not very factual for typical surgery experiences. If you are looking for detailed answers to your questions about WLS, you may want to read the various books out by Michelle Boasten, who is an RN and presents information in a more objective manner."
4,VERY INFORMATIVE,"I AM STILL READING THIS BOOK AS I AM PRE-OP AND I LOVE IT. I FOUND IT VERY INFORMATIVE AND I WILL KEEP THE BOOK FOR FUTURE REFERANCE. THE BOOK SEEMS TO GIVE US ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS SURGERY . I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BARBARA THOMPSON WRITE A BOOK ON RECIPES AND HOW TO USE PROTEIN , MAKE SHAKES, AND DIFFERENT ITEMS SO WE WONT GET BORED EATING DIFFERENT ."
5,"""Won't Go Wrong""","Lenny Wilkens does a more then credible job with this video. I purchased this along with ""48 Championship Basketball Drills"" and found both of them to be very good. He gets into some technical things but keeps it simple enough for weekend youth coaches like myself to understand. You won't go wrong with either of these videos."
4,"Great Product, Bottle Sucks!","Great Bronzer, but the bottle is so oddly shaped. I love to tan before I work out, and this product is dark with no reddening of the skin or tingles. Smells great for tanning product! Excellent price!!!Difficult to place the bottle on a flat surface without it falling over, especially when it runs low. I wish they would change the bottle!!!!!"
3,GOOD PLOT GONE BAD!,"The book started out and continued to be a great, exciting story that kept me and my daughter wanting to read more. At the very end, in the last 20-25 pages its appeal declined. I don't want to give the ending away, but it mentions things like our ancestors, the apes, talks a lot about evolution, and has people getting energy from the earth and releasing it in strange, telepathic ways. As a Christian I would not want my daughter to have read it without me. I am glad we read it together so we can discuss the things that go against our beliefs. We definitely decided against reading the sequal ""BAR CODE REBELLION"""
5,The Best Book,"I chose to read this book for my book report, i thought it was just another so-so book. I started reading it and in the beginning it was a little bland. After the first couple of chapters it's an amazing adventure. If you like this book, or at least think that you'll like it, then you'll love The Barcode Rebellion.I totally give this book a 5."
4,This is where we're heading...,"This book is really quite good because it shows where the world is probably headed unless we get some good people to lead out country. In the beginnig, it it very morbid and depressing. The bad aspects (while they really add to the story and make it better)are quickly over, and it becomes and man- or woman, in this case- vs. herself vs. nature type of novel. Kayla is just trying to survive and overcome her fears, with the addition of becoming a fugitive in a few short months and the ever-present fear of becomeing insane due to a family gene. The Bar Code Tattoo is something anyone who works for the government should read, especially id they are high up. It is also a good book for science fiction fans, as it takes place in the future. I myself have read it four times."
2,Bar code tattoo,"From the description,this book seems like a good read. To be honest, there aren't many explanations, and the plot jumps around too much to the point that it becomes a bit confusing. The only reason why I rated this a two star is because the idea is different. Then again now there are a lot of dystopia books out there."
5,Invaluable,"I found this book very interesting and useful for anybody who works in a law firm or will soon do so. I found the writing very intelligent although he went on tangents about the meaning of rather obscure words sometimes. He covers areas about working in a law firm that you won't find anywhere else, such as how to deal with secretaries, and covers basically every aspect you could possibly need. Without the ability to speak to totally honest lawyers about what you really need to know when working in a law firm, this book is invaluable."
2,"Michelle Yeoh is great, the movie is just ok","Wow in this film Michelle Yeoh shows that she is an amazing martial artist!! The movie itself was just so-so though. It's about how her character is trying to rescue a city leader (in Mongolia I think) from the Japanese. It didn't really feel like an adventure, as one might assume from her Indiana Jones-esque character. Plot was passable - not nearly as gripping as I would have liked, and the pacing left me bored at times. So despite Michelle Yeoh's awesome fighting and charismatic acting, this movie was just OK."
3,Contents is rich but book is very expensive.,Contents is rich but book is very expensive. Each page you read will cost you 2$.
2,Pretty plain Jane,"I've had the Nuvi 2595 lmt for some time. As far as whistles and bells go this little unit has it all over the 7200 street pilot, which has virtually none. The only thing 7200 has that the 2595 doesn't is an AV/out, and a larger screen but two inches of screen sure isn't worth the extra costs for me. The biggest reason I bought the 7200 is for the volume controls because I'm hearing impaired, not deaf. Even with the volume all the way up it's hardly any louder than the 2595 which has no controls for volume. Over all I""m pretty disappointed in the 7200, and according to specs and customer reviews I've read the 7500 isn't any better. For my money smaller apparently is better in this case.Garmin Streetpilot 7200 7-inch GPS Receiver - Europe - Includes North American maps. Does Not include XM Radio"
3,Stret Pilot 7200 Garmin,I like the large screen. We had a couple of problems on our first real trip out with it. It directed us through a town instead of the major highway on the outskirts of town. And it also directed us to a dirt road through the mountains as a shortcut to get the rest of the way home. We are not in to traveling dirt roads even to save time and gas. Hopefully a future download from the place that made the product will fix this problem.
3,It's as if someone cut John's leash.,"One thing I really enjoy about Irving is his ability to make one think they are reading something for entertainment and then it turns out to be so much more. Circus doesn't do that but it seems that Irving tried to salvage that ideal by inserting contrived sentimentality near the end. I didn't buy it. It was weird from the beginning and got weirder in the middle so I was expecting quite a bizarre ending. No such luck. I felt roped in to one type of book and then cast out. It seemed that Irving was trying to ride the caboose of the Garp-Owen train and he was on a different track. Trying to jump back, something happened and I don't know what. It wasn't a bad book; I just felt I was reading someone who wanted to write like John Irving."
1,All The Quirky Style Of Irving With None Of The Substance,"It's like Irving's body typed up this appallingly lame load of trash while his soul went on hiatus or something. Read anything else by him, but don't waste your time with this shameful waste of trees."
5,A masterful comic tale of an exotic place,"Having read Irving for years, the ""Dickensian"" style is expected and revered. I have always loved the melodic prose and tangent wanderings I stroll down as Irving spins his tale. It takes a confident writer to uproot his ""perspective"" (for lack of a better world) and give us a book (or story) that is not from his general life. To take a reader to India and invite us into the travels and experiences as Mr Irving did was a trip I felt like taking, without looking back to see if Owen Meaney or Chipper Dove was carrying our baggage. Some writers lack the courage or imagination to take their readers to places outside of their surroundings, but Mr Irving fearlessly provides the visa.The book was tremendous: Lavish, intriguing, detailed and very funny.. Don't look for Garp of State O' Maine....Let Dr. Daruwalla engage your soul."
2,What happened?,"As a huge John Irving fan, I found this one to be a crushing disappointment. Nowhere is the usual magic found...the characters are uninspired, the plot goes nowhere and the India setting is totally wasted. When a few eccentrics do appear, they just seem like Irving is stretching for something, anything, to try to entertain us as we slog through this mess.This is something I thought I'd never say when I was first into the throes of Owen Meany and Cider House, but here it is: This John Irving novel is boring!"
1,Unbearably Boring,"I was amazed when I read ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" that this author was so good that he could take a story that I didn't like and tell it so well that I was interested until the somewhat ridiculous ending. So its been a few years and I thought I would try another John Irving.I gave it 68 pages of my life. I was waiting for even the slightest spark to occur. Even a remotely interesting nuance. Nothing. Boring characters, boring setting, boring story. Come to think of it there wasn't a story at all. If I were eternal I would finish it, but life has too many good books and experiences awaiting to persevere with something so pointless and meaningless in a life that will end all too soon."
1,Tough to get through....,"I think I've enjoyed every other John Irving book I've read, however 'Son of a Circus' was a really tough read .... I honestly didn't enjoy the book at all (however, I try to finish once I start).If you are new to John Irving - I implore you to skip this book and try one of the better books (World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany, etc.)."
1,as disappointed a reader as can be,"John:Why? What happened? I used to think John Irving was one of the wittiest, funniest authors of his generation... But this book is one of the most pathetic ones I have ever read in a long time. By experimenting with pulp fiction John Irving made me forget about how good his previous books are. For anyone whose picking up one of his books for the first time: please stay away from Son of a Circus or you'll never read him again!"
1,Unfortunate,"Mr. Rowley presents a very opinionated, yet overly-simplistic review of the 'culture wars' that take place on campuses around the country. As a college student at a liberal institution, I can sympathize with him in his view of the close-mindedness of the political left, something most often attributed to 'conservatives'. Unfortunately, Mr. Rowley's amateurish account of his years as a studet (or was it as a football player?)at Brown University only serve to reinforce this latter point. His views are laced with a type of reactionism common to most college Freshmen, whether left- or right-leaning, but lack the intellectual development of a writer apparently some years removed from life as a college student."
1,Disgraceful Appropriation of a Unique Culture,"While I HIGHLY recommend the wonderful ""Heart of the Forest"" CD, comprised of field recordings of authentic Baka music, this ""Spirit of the Forest"" should be titled ""Spirit of Exploitation."" The original music and sounds of the Baka people are mixed with Western instrumentation that destroys the spirit of the forest and turns it into a ""Dance Remix"" pile of studio mush. It's way, way Beyond Baka alright. Forego this commercial bastardization and get the real thing, Heart of the Forest!"
5,Inventive blending of contemporary and indigenous music,"The energy in the cuts from this CD is infectious. Percussion, local instrumentation and seamless vocals blend into a package that defies description. The world beat is evident, but Craddock has suceeded in using the Pygmy voices and music conventions in music that does not jar our Western ear. The rhythms are intricate. The vocals are smooth and blend beautifully on each track. It has become one of my favorite CDs to keep me company as I workout on the Nordictrack, driving me with the beat and energy to work just a little harder!Each time I listen to ""Spirit of the Forest,"" I discover some new nuance that I'd not heard before. In these days of ""CD of the week,"" the desire to hear it again months later speaks volumes to its creativeness."
3,Not a complete product,"While the book itself was in good condition ""wear & tear"" wise, the first seven chapter quizzes were missing. The pages had been torn out, probably due to usage, so the book began with chapter 8. Not good. No explanation or warning was provided before my purchase was made. In fact, no explanation was provided in the package either. I believe this is poor salesmanship. Other quiz books (complete) sold for the same price range so there was no ""implied"" discount either."
3,Difficult people have tormented love affairs,"This is the story of the tormented love affair between Martin and Alejandra. She is unapprehensible, strange and cruel. Martin loves her passionately, but she despises him and treats him really bad. Her father is a paranoid who spends his life studying the blind and feeling chased by them (Sabato, like Saramago, is also obsessed with blindness). This is a complex book about dark and obnubilated minds, lost in a chaos of doubts and insecurities, of tragedy, solitude and mistery.Although the treatment of the plot is interesting, especially the chapter on blindness, I found the characters unlikable. I don't agree with people that don't like books because the characters were unlikable. Then we should only write books about nice persons. But these characters were utterly irritating. Perhaps, though, you can find real depth and meaning in the book."
4,Watch it with friends and its great!!,"Some movies are best watched alone. Some it doesn't matter. This is one you should watch with good friends who like to hoot and giggle and who don't mind it if you have frequent breaks for comments. Its 1950's serials with great color. And surprizingly, the characters do have some shadings."
3,"Flash Gordon, Finally","I'm very glad to see this awesome camp favorite finally out on DVD. I would have been happier to see it in HD or Blu-Ray.Many people have already expressed their disappointment with the extra features, so I won't go there.Overall, this is the movie you wanted to own on DVD, on DVD. It is what it is. Nothing special, nothing horrible."
3,Playing Space,"Rather homoerotic story of good guys saving a life from a bad guy of the outer space, is a funny picture providing an introduction of torture and S&M; actions.Actually clever and funny sci-fi is made well on merits of cinema of the seventieth.It is something betweenMeet the SpartansandStar Wars.Not much The Queen's sharm music at all."
2,Not Worth It...,"I own the Silver Anniversary Edition from Amazon.co.uk. It's got better features and packaging, and you will pay a lot less for it.Just make sure you have a region-free dvd player. I actually bought one so I could play the UK versions of dvds they try to price-rape you with here. Look for a Nexxtech or something similiar for around 30 bucks.Ordered 1984 on dvd for cheap, too.***UPDATE*** 8-14-07Reordered the UK edition, as my origional metal-cased Silver Anniversary edition is now the property of my ex... It's no longer packaged in the same dvd case. While the artwork is the same, the case is now just a silver plastic snapcase. Just wanted to share that with potential collectors."
4,nostalgia,"I grew up watching flash gordon, although i am only thirty i still appreciated the film when i was a child and i must say it had an affect on my little mind. The film on blu ray is really good, to my surprise. Sound, and visual quality for such an old film is fantastic. As a film it's not that great, but i'm nostalgic and some times i need to relive my child hood by watching movies like this. Thanks flash!"
2,Know Before You Buy!,"For me, what made this Flash Gordon movie so special was the music by Queen (though Brian Blessed is great!) and if that's what you remember and why you are considering buying this DVD, then DON'T!The images are clear. The story as campy and fun as ever. But the music seems to have been phoned in from Hong Kong over a very bad connection. For me, this ruined everything. Save your money. Better to by the CD of the soundtrack!! How in this day and with the technology available this DVD ever saw the light of day is beyond me."
5,takes me back to my childhood,"i have fond memories of going to see this in the movie theatre with my cousins back in the day. dino delaurentis, the producer, also produced the superman movies with christopher reeve. great soundtrack by queen. although sam j jones and melody anderson didn't make any other noteworthy movies after this, there were a lot of talented actors and actresses in this movie: topol, timothy dalton, max von sydow, ornela muti, mariangela melato, and peter wyngarde."
4,I traveled to my childhood,"I just end watching the film and it totally transported myself to my childhood back on 1980 when I was a 7 years old kid. I Know this movie is kind of cheesy and has this theatrical, over-acted old-style movie look. But it is very entertaining, so much fun to see and you don't get bored at any moment. The lines are so golden-age comic-styled and the production design is totally based on the 1930's original art concepts.Its a must have movie for the fans.Positive points: You can have the pic now. The quality is acceptable. You can watch the first 1936's Flash Gordon chapter, totally new for me! The packaging is so collective and deluxe. Its always nice to hear Queen's soundtrack.Negative points: Some errors in lipsynch. A booklet would have been nice.In general terms: am so happy with this product. I recommend it if you watched this film as a child and now you want to enjoy some time feeling the way you felt back in 1980."
4,Movie a 5; Lacking most Important Special Feature,"The Special Feature that must happen is the one where Queen's soundtrack is the only thing you hear. Including each time it is used to ""hear"" movement. That soundtrack is beyond amazing.The movie itself is a tribute to how special effects were done prior to the advent of computers. Why not a featurette on how these techniques were done? Interviews with the various actors, the costumer, etc. would also be wonderful. The costumes were amazing! An inspiration to any costumer.I have the Region 2 DVD and am very happy with it."
1,What the....,"For Christ sakes. This man has been a hero for me in the progressive rock field all my life. I've recently started delving into some of the solo work which I find to be uninspiring and as lyrcially inept as most of the recent YES works. I've had enough of Children, Light and love in every friggen' song. I can't even see a reason he would bother to release this foolish bootleg CD. Retire Gramps."
2,Police reporter,I only made it to page 40 of this book it was so boring . Its like the first 38 pages is nothing but the reporter getting up and going to work and waiting for a crime to happen . His interview with his boss . NO big crime happens in the first 4o pages unless I feel asleep and missed it while reading :) . Boring book and my first and last Gelman that I will read .
1,Buttered plastic?,Each bag was covered on the outside with butter between the popcorn bag and sealed plastic wrapping. I don't understand how this could happen but it did and with every popped bag you get a butter covered bag! Not good.
3,Kinda bland and they like to burn,The taste is kinda bland compared to other brands of popcorn. But what really makes this product stand is it's ability to burn in the microwave when following the instructions exactly. Would not buy again.
5,Popcorn,"Very good popcorn, will order more. Will definitely recommend to anyone that loves popcorn like I do. The popcorn is Good !"
3,Okay but don't ask too much of it,"Fairly simple to use and it covers the basics but can stand a lot of improvement. For example, if I create an invoice, if I leave the program I can't come back and change or add anything. It creates an invoice and it prints it. It does keep track of customers but any changes in design don't always stay.What do you expect for less than $10?"
3,Mixed Bag With Some Gems,"I came to this through hearing Mike Roe's ""Mercy Seat"" which is a knock out track -- one of Roe's best, and that is saying a lot for this veteran solo artist and leader of the 77s. However, Mercy Seat sounds absolutely nothing like the rest of the cuts. In fact, no two cuts sound much alike even though there is an attempt to blend them into one another and find some kind of common ground. Nevertheless, several of the tracks are very, very well done. So, if you are willing to be taken on an unusual musical trip, I recommend you give this a listen and a buy -- and if you like Roe/77s, the whole disc is worthy Mercy Seat...well, well, well."
2,Not Worth the Time or Money,"While this book is perhaps not completely useless, I do not feel like those who are actually interested in studying this subject will gain anything of substance from this book. It does not seem to create a foundation for the trinitarian doctrine and it is too basic to support scholarship. Overall, this book does not measure up to the scholarship of Reformed Theology (of which I am not a part but well respect). Robert Letham has a better Reformed perspective (though admittedly a more difficult read) and there are others outside the Reformed community whose books will better serve as (basic) foundational studies in both the areas of doctrine & practicality (Bruce A. Ware) and history (Roger E. Olson and Christopher A. Hall)."
5,Funny and is what happens when cruising,"My husband and I are former sailors turned to trawler cruising. This book brought back so many memories of us going thru the Panama Canal, having close calls with tankers out in the ocean and meeting single-handers with no navigational lights at night. I laughed out loud so much my side hurt. Would recommend to those thinking about cruising and anyone else who can relate to Ray's great sense of humor.Barbara"
2,This is Not It,"If you're looking for the Johnny Appleseed cartoon that you saw in the 1970's or 1980's, this is not it. In the old story, he walked all over the country starting orchards and singing, ""The Lord is Good to Me."" There was lots of color. In this story the colors are blue and brown, and he stays in a little town trying to convince everyone the virtues of apples & juice. No singing. I am disappointed."
1,Unreadable,"God, this book is a turgid and inscrutable bore, which is a shame, as it attempts to deconstruct one of the least boring (if most puzzling) films ever made. Talens is everything Bunuel is not -- overserious where he is playful, pretentious where he is self-effacing, and downright doggedly dull where he is lively and witty. Avoid at all costs."
5,A great overview,This book contains a great overview of many of the challenges a teacher might see in her students. My son has many of the challenges described in the book while some of his peers are faced with the other challenges.
1,Disappointed,"I'm a grandmother, trying to help my daughter find information on how to deal with the behavior of children with possible ADHD. Her son is 3-1/2 and can be difficult to control at times. I didn't pass this book on to her because I didn't feel it would help."
2,I'm glad I didn't read this BEFORE applying to law school!,"Negativity abounds in this book. The author (and I find it highly suspect that he wouldn't publish under his own name) clearly is a bitter, bitter person. Of course, since I'm going to a less than tier one school at night (double horrors!), what do I know? The way the author made it sound, I may as well not go at all, as I am doomed to fail and wind up in the gutter somewhere. I've gotten to chapter six, and am going to try to slog my way through the rest of it, as some of the reviewers have said he does have some insight into studying methods, but this book is very discouraging. If you want to go to law school, I would buy anything other than this book, you will only get depressed."
5,A must have for law students who wish to excel!!!!!!,"I have read many books on how to do well in law school. This one blows them all away! The author's insights are refreshingly honest. He takes you beyond the basics that most law school books stop at, and gives you many sources to turn to in order to prepare you better. If you are serious about being ready, read this. I am starting law school in the fall, and feel much more prepared after reading Planet Law School."
4,Read this book three years ago .. and now I'm graduating,"I bought this book before I started law school, and in just a few weeks I'll be graduating. I would recommend this book to anyone planning on going to law school - read the recommended books (especially the Examples and Explanation series - I've bought them for every class I could), learn about study groups and outlines and study aids, but take the advice on the ""horrors of law school"" with a grain of salt.Maybe its because I went to a 4th tier law school (yet one I've very pround of!) but there was no back-stabbing, no in-class put-downs by professors, no hiding books - I went to a school were people actually give you notes if you miss a class - without you're having to ask for them - and where the rest of the class will chime in if someone is ""on call"" and doesn't know the answer (or as we say in class, ""co-counsel"").In any event, be prepared to work your tail off for three years, but enjoy yourself too."
2,Not very useful at a top 10 law school,"PLS's list of recommended study aids is useful. However, I would be very wary of the author's advice to blow off anything concerning policy and concentrate only on the black letter law. At UVA, my experience so far has been that professors take it as a given that you know the black letter, and on the exams you are expected to show your mastery of the policy behind the black letter. Also, the author's advice of not paying much attention to the cases is dead wrong. Without an understanding of the cases, you will never learn the policy reasoning. In short, his advice may fly at a second-tier school, but if you attend a top school, take his advice with a grain of salt"
1,Correcting the Correction Below,"Just a quick note to correct the person who misread my review below. I said the author suggests that students not BUY THE CASE BOOKS -- not sure how the person below got out of that that I said the author suggested students not read CASES (it would be pretty hard to pass your first year of law school w/o reading the cases, since law school is either case or statute driven exclusively). Hope the reviewer correcting my review doesn't read statutes like s/he reads reviews or his/her clients are in big trouble."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Do not waste your time or money buying and reading this book. Instead, purchase a copy of Law School Confidential and keep that close. The only major advantage that this book has is its explanation of terms like ""hornbook"" and its detailed discussion of study aids. With those exceptions (which are just one chapter) the rest of the book is a rambling diatribe from a disillusioned former law student. The author feels that professors are the enemeny in law school and he repeats his feelings over and over and over and over and over again in every section of the book. You have to sift through too much whining to find something meaningful and useful in this book. Don't waste your time."
2,Planet Law School,"There is some useful information in this book. Primarily the sections which refer you to other pre-law-school books and study aids. That information buys it two stars.Unfortunately the rest of the book is not as helpful. There is far too much space devoted to (1) how smart the author is (2) how much he dislikes his life as a lawyer and (3) how you can become just like him.I felt that Law School Confidential was much better, it contains more useful information and less depressingly cynical commentary...."
5,"If you're a law student, you must read this.","This book blows me away. I've finished two years of law school, and PLS has helped me immensely. I've read many law school books, and always come back to this one. (I gave the others away, and have read PLS probably at least 5 times. I will not give this one away.) It has stuff for every phase of preparing to be a lawyer, from high school courses to college on to several chapters on getting a law job. I recommend it to every law student. I also recommend it to every college student even thinking about law school."
2,Not worth it.,"This book does contain a few good tips, but overall, it consists mostly of one person's complaints about his experience in school. This book will not get you better grades in law school, and will only provide you with horror stories which generally don't appear to be true anymore (if they ever were). Falcon presents you with one truth -- getting good grades will take some work. First year is hard, but manageable. I would not purchase this book. If you need advice for school, look to others that have attended the same school as you (within the past couple years). Also, relax, your first year will be a little stressful, but it's always manageable."
1,Waste of money!,"After two months in law school, I've found ""Falcon""s opinions to be of not much help. The tone of the book is very patronizing, as if he knows it all, and I think there are far better options out there (I would highly recommend Shapo's Law School without Fear for a much more intelligent approach to the same topic)."
1,Not what it appears,"This book is partly about what one person thinks will help you in law school and mostly about the complaints he has about law school in general. This book is unorganized, tangential, and very difficult to read. It's 800 pages long. The advice about law school is probably only about 200 of those pages. The rest is an unfocused rant about ""the ivory tower"" of law school and why law school professors are out to get you. This book is not really helpful for 1Ls. I would recommend either reading something else or skimming this book at most."
1,You've got to be joking!,"I will be attending law school this fall (2003). While I've no experiences of my own to compare to what Falcon writes, I cannot believe that a lawyer-especially one who claims to have attended a top tier school-could produce such a poorly written book. His style is a bitter, cynical diatribe that knows no subtlty. He often capitalizes words for no apparent reason, hyphenates words in the wrong places and uses a dizzying series of mixed metephors, absurd analogies and simplistic historical examples. His prose reveals him as one who has little knowledge of history and the English language, never mind law school. This book is in bad need of a good editor. It is indeed suspect that the author does not reveal his identity or that of the school of law that he attended. I'd be wary of this one."
1,Don' bother,"I am a prospective law school student and my mother picked up this book for me to read - to prepare me. All she did was spent 20 dollars on a book that told me to spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on other materials. Those other materials ARE valuable, so don't waste your money on this book when it could be spent elsewhere. Pick up a copy from the library or split the cost with SEVERAL friends, find where it directs you and go (mainly look at chapter 5). Otherwise, this book is worthless, don't believe all these others who claim it is God."
3,"tough read, but worth it","This book is written in a very academic style, so the 200 pages seems like 500. Other than that, it's a decent primer on semiotics."
4,Treat it as a checklist,"So, the economy sucks right now and there are way too many lawyers in this country. So this isn't the time to be making stupid mistakes in cover letters, resumes, and interviews. I have been looking for a job for several months now, although not aggressively. After reading this book I realized how many mistakes I made while looking for a job in my first year of law school. I know I could have done better if I had read this book at least two years ago. I now treat it basically as a checklist of the most important things to do during a job search. I refer to it often, such as the night before an interview, so as to refresh myself on how to prepare."
5,Happy Trails,Item arrived in perfect condition and very quickly. Will trade again in the future. Thank you.
4,Sublime,"If you love movies and you love good music, this is the cd for you. You listen to it and close your eyes and you have a little movie playing in your head. Its awesome."
4,A weird and wonderful fusion,"I know nothing about flamenco music or Spanish guitarists, but I got this recording because I dig the Malian musicians on it. The vibe they create with their Iberian compadres is truly something to listen to. The songs run the gamut from the soothing strains of ""Pozo del Deseo"" to snappy numbers like ""Su te mone bo."" Songhai's first recording is just as good, though it seems not to be available here. Fans of Malian music--particularly the ubiquitous kora player Toumani Diabate--will no doubt admire this striking and unusual collaboration."
1,"Don't order, has wrong connectors.","Has BNC connectors, not F connectors. Totally useless for TV. Has BNC connectors, not F connectors. Totally useless for TV."
2,"Right Phone, Wrong Language","My husband bought the phone for our daughter (texting is a big deal). It looked like a real RAZR, but soon the differences started appearing. The time stamp was wrong. Changes to settings could not be made. And the phone texted in CHINESE! We called Motorola, and they said the model number and serial number was not one of theirs (back of phone said ""China Mobile""). The plug was an international plug, useless in the U.S. Fortunately, Amazon was vey good about helping us return the phone (hence 2 stars instead of 1)."
4,Nice Phone,This is a very pretty phone and works great! It's easy to use and fairly easy to change SIM cards especially if you're traveling overseas.
2,Poor Reception,"I purchased this phone for my wife, as a replacement to her broken RAZR V3.She has complained ever since that the reception is terrible. I spoke to a young man who unlocks phones for a living and his response was that it was not properly unlocked. For the money spent, I expected a phone to provide identical results as the same model it was replacing. As this has no warranty I am stuck."
1,magenta razor,I had to return the phone because some of the keys didn't work and after 2 hours it wouldn't turn on even though it was fully charged. Item was returned for full credit.
2,GOOD AND BAD,"The phone works great. Great reception, sound, and video quality. The only real problem is the charging. Plug in the charger, set the phone down and it is charging fine, come back in a few minutes and it is no longer charging as if the cord is not even there, or it has completely shut down and is no longer charging. Have to unplug the cord and replug it and the charge starts over. This can happen over and over, can take days to charge this phone. Have taken it back twice. First time they replaced the battery, it did the same thing. Second time they replaced the whole phone, it worked great for a few weeks, now the new one is doing the SAME thing.What good is a phone that won't charge!"
3,Don't buy this if you need to read messages in anything other than the Roman alphabet.,"All my text messages from Russia are blacked out. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the Portuguese, Dutch, French, etc. and get Russian."
2,Defective,Could not hear party on other end of line properly. Sent it back to place where it came from tthe other day.
2,"It works as a phone, but not much else!","I bought this unlocked phone for my wife whose phone broke after the warranty expired. I wanted to get a cheap replacement for her until her upgrade was available. The first phone we received was not unlocked and had to be sent back. The customer serviceperson was great. They sent us another phone and a free leather motorolla case. This other phone works on AT&T networks, but many of the features are hardwired just for T-mobile. It is not very user friendly. Get it for a cheap phone, but not for something you want to use for texting or web."
1,not that happy,I loved the phone at first.It worked for about a month and now the screen nore the camera work!!the screen is black!! it won't do anything!!!Even the outside screen is black!!! and I cannot take any pictures because the screen won't work!!i can call out and get incomming calls but cannot see anything the only way i know who it is is beacuse i set certain ringtones. I can get texts but of couse cannot read them because the top half of the phone doesn't work!!!!!! i am very careful with my stuff so it was nothing i did. i really like the phone if it would just work right.
1,RAZR Phones suck that is why they are recalled!,"Oh sure these phones look good and have neat qualities, but the damn things cut out when you are talking,. hold no charge at all etc etc.They have been recalled for this reason. I suggest anyonme that buys cell phones avoid buying Motorola. Every phone we have purchased from them SUCKS!"
4,America's Best World War I Novel,"If asked to name a World War I novel most Americans would almost certainly say ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". Thanks to our rather uniform public education system, Remarque's novel has earned a place in American culture as the quintessential novel of The Great War. It deserves its reputation as a landmark of 20th century literature, but unfortunately its success contributed to the disapearance from memory of Thomas Boyd's ""Through the Wheat"". Without moralizing about the cost of war, Boyd brilliantly depicts its horrors and their effects on the psyche of a young American Marine. If you want to understand the Combat experience -- the noise, dirt, distraction, sweat, blood, stench of war -- this is a novel you must read. It is a tragedy that it is no longer in print."
5,"Maura O'Connell's ""Stories"" is one of my new favorites.","I just saw a professional dance troop preform to the song ""Poetic Justice"" and I was over-whelmed by the song. They used a med-evil type floor show and the song fit so well with the show that I was awash with tear by the end of the preformance. I still do not know which made me cry more: the show or the song. They both touched me in a very real and dear way."
3,Occasional nightmare.,"The industry standard, accepted everywhere. Easy to use but with bugs that will crash and lose your script FOREVER!!! Too many problems with Version 6 unexpectedly crashing and deleting scripts. Updated to Version 7 that has worked fine for a couple of years but has now duplicated problems same as Version 6. How many times does one have to buy updates to get a product that will just perform a basic function without deleting hours of hard work?"
5,Great!!!!!!!,This is an extremely useful tool for anyone who's serious about writing a screenplay. A must have for both amateurs and professionals!!
5,Does so much more than I thought,"I have to admit I didn't know that much about the software expect that it formatted screenplays and had notecards. I bought it because of a recommendation, I heard it was the best. When I did the tutorial I learned that it did so much more than write a script. It's a word processor, and has templates for treatments, outlines, manuscripts, resumes, and of course, as advertised does stageplays and TV shows. But it has different templates for BBC TV shows and 3 different types of stageplays, as well as broadway musicals. It also comes with Tagger a software that tags items like character, locations, and props in your script to breakdown for schedules and budgets. I can't tell you a lot about the bugs people are talking about because I have not noticed anything yet. I didn't use the other versions so I have no complaints about this version. The software has done nothing but been a blessing to me."
2,Mac users beware,"I noticed ""Designed for Windows"" printed on the box as I was opening it. Wish I would have seen this on the product page before buying it. You open the program on a Mac and it looks like you're using a PC. No keyboard shortcuts for things like adding a scene index card, so you have to keep going up and using the pull-down menu. When I tried to rearrange my scene cards, the card to be shuffled turned into a blank card, for some reason. Maybe if I hadn't spent $170 bucks for this, it wouldn't have been so bad. Mac users, I advise you to steer clear of this and try Montage or Movie Magic Screenwriter."
1,This program sucks,"I'm a professional screenwriter who started on FD back in the day and then converted to Movie Magic. I'm having to use FD 7 on a project I'm collaborating on and it's crashed 5 times now. I hate the interface, it's glitchy, and it doesn't have cool MM features. I do like the format when you print, but man, it ain't worth it. Wish I'd talked my partner into going w/ Movie Magic."
1,Disappointing,This book was disjointed with the story jumping years at a time. The plot was a little obvious and I'm used to more suspense and romance in NR books. The graphic violence toward the end of the book was unnecessry and did not add value.I am usually a big NR fan and enjoy the experience of reading her books. I can't say that about this one. It was just disappointing.
2,Seriously Way Too Long,This could've been a good book but it was way too long and the whole love at first sight thing bothered me. I felt like it would never end. I'm amazed they made a movie out of it.
5,Couldn't put it down,"And that's the truth. I was enthralled with this book. The Italian family back story was great. I don't agree with the other reviews that this was a graphic novel. I'm very squeamish when it comes to blood and guts and I thought the book was very reserved. I think that could come from reading Ann Rule books.I'm sooooo glad this did not end up being a big romance book. I don't think I could have taken it. And that shies me away from more of her novels. This had suspense, love, family and I love that nothing goes indepth between the periods of time where things happened to the main character.Character development was good and I love how she incorporated so many different agencies that deal with arson.In my opinion it was a great book. You just couldn't wait to get to the next part. The ending is a bit abrupt and almost without fanfare, but it's still good."
1,another disappointed reader,"Ms. Roberts is, in my opinion, one of the best at writing romantic or romantic suspence novels with well-written characterizations, warmth and wit and that's why I love reading her books and own many. I don't think she does as well with the degree of violence she attempts in this book or the handling of a sociopath on the loose, nor did I enjoy reading it. This is one book I do not plan to own or read again."
1,This woman needs an editor,"Is this woman really a best-selling author? Why, oh, why? Obvious plot, dimwitted ""heroine"" who doesn't seem to cotton on to the fact that her boyfriends tend to burn up, plastic Italian family love-fest . . . the story goes nowhere. Glad I checked it out of the library."
4,Blue Smoke,Very entertaining! If I could have I would of read straight through in one sitting. This author can paint a scene and make you feel just like you are in the action!
5,great book,"i don't understand where the ""horror"" of the previous reviews come from. unlike the NR romantic suspense, in this one i see crime novel. and an excellent one it is. yes, there is romance (and excellent it is too)but there is also the gritty who-done-it. i loved the book. the hero is so wonderfully into the heroine. the family is great. the relantionship between friends is great. my only problem is that the heroine didn't suspect who the bad guy was sooner. but that would have made for a shorter story. if you enjoy the ""in death"" series, i would highly recommend this book."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I love Nora Roberts' books and usually buy them all when they hit paperback, but one read of this one from the library was enough. I loved Reena's family and her interaction with Bo, but it was not necessary to take us that deep into the sewer-like mind of the murderer. I also kept waiting for a twist at the end, sure that the murderer could not be that obvious, but it was. Reluctantly, I have to say I was disappointed in this book."
3,SMOKE GOT IN MY EYES!,"Took me 100 pages before I really got into the book. Unusual for a Nora book. But then, it warmed up (pun intended :D) and it really got going.Research on fire was excellent. I loved the warm, loving, united Italian family. When Reena finally got around to Bo, the sparks started flying. (Sorry,I just cant seem to help myself! :D)Joey was evil enough for a J. D. Robb book and it broke my heart he was not salvageable. (Is that a word?) You knew it was he from the beginning, but I thought that intensifed the angst you felt that Reene was just not getting it quickly enough.Although there were too many victims, the book held my interest til the end. I am a very big believer of strong family connections to help you through what life throws at you.Finally, it was sweet to note that Nora dedicated the book to her husband, ""her own carpenter guy""."
4,blue smoke,"This is only the 3rd book I have read by Nora Roberts and it was definitely interesting. It's a bit gory and explicit so be aware but the characters are likeable and the story draws you in. It's a bit slow in the beginning but picks up towards the middle. I had a hard time putting it down. The only thing that disappointed me was that it builds and builds and the part that's supposed to be the climax of the book lasts about a page to a page and a half. So all that good in the middle gets a lack luster ending. But nevertheless romance is there, the suspense is there. If you're up for a read this was a good book overall."
3,"Blue Smoke, good but not great!","Good, but not Nora at her best. However, she has set the bar rather high with single books like ""Montana Sky"", ""The Reef"", ""The Villa"", and ""Hidden Riches"", to name a few which I enjoyed much more. Nora has many gifts as an author,one, she quickly makes you care about the people in the story, two, she's great at describing families and their dynamics (I always love her family dinners, because they remind me of my own and I always feel I'm at the event), three, she transports you to a different world (ranch life or the wine business), and last but not least the romantic relationships always seem so REAL!! It's in these last two areas where I feel Blue Smoke doesn't deliver beyond okay."
1,Customer Service is a Joke,"Buy the battery somewhere else. I purchased this product and received the wrong door. Without the correct door, the battery is useless. I called ""Customer Service"" twice, left messages including the order number and my phone number. They never called. I emailed them and they didn't respond. I'm caught in a Catch-22. Without without a RMA number I can't return the product and they will not respond with an RMA number. Eventually, I bought the standard battery at Radio Shack."
5,Well worth the thicker profile,"Wasn't sure I should buy this since one of the things I like about my cell phone is its slim profile, but my usage dictated this decision. I was tired of not being able to get through an entire day on the overnight charge. I had to charge my phone overnight and again for an hour or two in the middle of the day. Not anymore. Now I can forget to charge it for several nights in a row and the battery indicator doesn't even read low. For me, the extra battery life is well worth the thicker profile."
3,Bickering Siblings Taint Story Quality,"I think this DVD is good. My 2-year old enjoys these mysteries, and I like the Richard Scarry illustrations. However, the sibling rivalry between the two pigs gets old, and is in each of the six episodes (briefly). The other characters just seem to ignore it or laugh it off, but I hope my daughter doesn't immitate the pigs' selfish attitudes."
5,Hurray For Huckle DVD,"This is a great DVD- our 4yr. old son loves it. We love Richard Scarry, anyway...and the DVD came in great time!"
2,Nice Overview... but there are better books out there,"When I checked out this book, I was expecting some innovative method that would drastically change my approach to the job search. Instead, what I read was repackaged information that you could find on the Internet. Instead, I would recommend10 Insider Secrets to a Winning Job Search: Everything You Need to Get the Job You Want in 24 Hours - Or Less. I found that book to be a more concise and thought provoking tool that helped me succeed in getting my most recent job as a Regional Sales Director."
4,An uplifting job search...,"Orville Pierson manages to break down the steps of job hunting into do-able chunks that make sense. I had a real lightbulb moment, too, as he explained how some of the ""playing by the rules"" steps, like sending resumes in response to classified ads, are not the most effective ways to get work. That alone helped me shift my priorities and begin to see the connections I already had in all the areas in my life, in a new light. I felt like I had a personal coach at my side: ""Good going! Yeah! You're doing it!"" This book is both a really useful aid--and uplifting, besides. Most important, his experience as a job coach validates the normalcy of the anxiety that comes with job searches. So while Orville helped tone down my nervousness, I could turn to the actual task of DOING something to get a job."
4,"Strictly for the ""Tudor-Motown"" sound afficionados ...","The Moodies started as a combo of Brummies Mods, studying religiously the black scene of the era, James Brown, Sonny-Boy Williamson and Gloria Banks (whose ""Go Now"" became a number one hit statesides). Their Lead singer, Denny Laine, co-wrote the bulk of their repertoire before leaving the band in 1967. This release includes their debut album, 12 r'n'b tunes very representative of the mid-sixties english sound ( check also the Nashville Teens) plus their entire production before embarking on a drastic change of musical direction under the baton of their new singer, Justin Hayward. Denny Lane will join later Wings to become one of their pivotal members."
3,Moody Blues - 'The Magnificent Moodies' (Repertoire),"Nice CD reissue of the band's earliest material,penned and released between 1964-66.Album's twelve original tracks,with seven bonus cuts tagged on.Do keep in mind this was the pre-Justin Hayward era for the Moody Blues.Lead guitarist&vocalist(future Wings member)Denny Laine took the center spot light here.Also try to remember these nineteen cuts are more in the soulful/R&B vein than any of the band's later works.Songs I found to my liking were ""I Don't Mind"",their British no.1 single ""Go Now"",""Stop"",their Willie Dixon cover ""Bye Bye Bird"" and ""Thank You Baby"".A very decent archive title to own and cherish.May not appeal to EVERY Moody fan.I liked it,though."
4,Good book,Really enjoyed reading this book. Didn't know much about Andrew Carnegie before I read this book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. He lived in a time that shaped the future of American and his influence in the American steel industry is well documented in this book. He was truly a remarkable man who made the most of his immigration to America and the opportunities he was given.
3,Love them but...,"I usually love Adidas Originals but these shoes scuff easily. I wore them twice and they already have scuffs on the leather from minor wear. Obviously, this all depends on how you take care of your shoes, but I didn't expect them to be that sensitive."
2,Halliday and Resnick much better text,"For the good: The electricity/magnetism section is a fairly good and understandable. The mechanics/heat/optics sections are comparable with other texts, but the section on sound and acoustics is terrible, and needs to be completely re-written. Like the reviewer from San Diego, I usually end up going to H & R, Young, or Giancoli for the better explanations (or sending my students there)."
3,5 stars for Symphony No 5,This CD is worth for the great performance of the Symphony No. 5. Which was approved by the composer herself. The other works are performed not that good. It's better to check Reinbert de Leeuw for Compositions and Octet. See ustvolskaya.org - 'performers' section for details.
4,The Same Band?,"If you listen to this album today, and compare it to what the Leps are doing now you might not think it is the same band! This is a straight ahead non-stop rock album that does not let up. When I first heard the song ""Rock Brigade"" I thought it was one of the best hard rock songs I have ever heard, and I still feel that way in 2005. It is a shame the band did not include any of these songs on Vault because they rock. This is by no means as commercial as Hysteria or Adrenilize, but that doesn't mean it isn't good! If Pyromania was your introduction to Def Leppard then you need to check this out and High 'N Dry. You won't be disappointed!"
1,NOT A DVD COLLECTION FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOGS,"I can't believe anyone would be so cruel as to put one of these features in a collection about dogs. ""A collection of Dog tales"" indeed. Is this for people who like to see animals suffer and make them suffer? In the Castle Rock DVD, they shoot the German Shepard dog with a gun. But only after it turns rabid and chases the heroine down and bites her companion.. yes, that's fun. Do dog lovers want to see the dog turn on the humans and then get shot? This DVD is simply a marketing ploy created by immoral people who only care about milking the public for a few more thousands to line their bank account. A law suit against GATAM media for false advertising would be welcome by me. The DVD menus are totally unclear as well. What do you expect from people who are soulless! Dogs and humans alike will hate this one."
4,Great value,"It's simple to use and produces perfectly cooked rice every time. I have introduced various flavoring additives, such as chili peppers, green peas, rosemary, etc., and it's always good."
2,I liked it until it quit working,"I'm on Amazon shopping for a replacement. It lasted for about 4 months of almost daily use. Then it stopped ticking. While it worked, I really liked it. Wish it would have been higher quality, but perhaps I got what I paid for. This time I'm going to try a more expensive one."
1,Don't Waste Your money,This water meter is awful. It lasted about 5 hours before it started leaking and making a funny noise.
1,Bad packaging costs Gilmour three stars,"Though the product itself functions adequately, the horrible rigid plastic clamshell creates a danger for skin cuts due to the need for slicing off several sides to access the product. One of the worst I've ever encountered.On the Gilmour website, the company states ""The quality of our products is unsurpassed, and we make it a point to offer environmentally friendly products that help customers use natural resources responsibly. . . . We're doing our part, both in what we make, and how we make it. Gilmour's new product and packaging programs will continue commitment efforts to a greener earth, greener lawns, . . .""But this packaging is a poor example of Gilmour's philosophy; indeed, it is a repudiation of their claim that they are environmentally friendly.Gilmour is a division of the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation of Peoria, Illinois. Perhaps the folks in Peoria can get the attention of the company and make it live up to its claims."
3,Maybe good in a pinch,Bought this as a back up for storms. Package was in good condition and arrived on time. I read a lot of reviews on this and some talked about the cheap design but I figured for the money I would give it a shot and purchased two. I can see what people were talking about but I don't intend on using this on a regular basis so hopefully it will be fine for a back up in an emergency
4,a pioneering text,"This is one of the first anthologies focusing on Black masculinities. Books like ""Black Men on Race, Gender, and Sexuality"" or ""Black Men in Their Own Words"" owe credit to it. The authors are diverse in terms of age, academic affiliation, sexual orientation, and citizenship. My favorite chapter is the dialogue between Essex Hemphill and Isaac Julien. Some have complained that men's studies texts are Eurocentric or unfairly assume that men face no oppressions. Powerful books like Belton's challenge those fallacies. There is a chance that some may feel the book is dated now. However, at its publication, it was revolutionary and much-needed. I highly recommend it."
4,Nice ajustable hinge,"This style of hinge requires special tooling to make the necessary cuts for mounting to the cabinet and the door. But as an end user, these are GREAT for removing and/or adjusting the cabinet doors. These seemed a little more expensive but work very well. It would have been nice to know that they were sold in pairs so I wouldn't have ended up with twice what I needed. Other hinges that I've tried came in single packs."
5,HURRY UP WITH SEASON 2 WARNER BROS OR YOU TOTALLY SUCK!!!,"WHY DIDN'T WARNER BROS. RELEASE SEASON ONE AND TWO TOGETHER LIKE THEY DID FOR ""DALLAS""? PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY GOT GREEDY AND IT BACK FIRED, DON'T PUNISH US WARNER BROS. BRING OUT THE REST OF THE SERIES OR SELL THE RIGHTS TO PARAMOUNT WHO NOW HAVE ""DYNASTY"", I AM TOO YOUNG TO HAVE WATCHED THIS ON TV, BUT I WOULD BUY THEM ALL, JUST LIKE I HAVE WITH ""DALLAS"". IF NOT WARNER BROS. YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FANS OF THE SHOW AND YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Yankee Grey rocks,I have been going and seeing this band locally for over 7 years now. I am glad to see they are finally getting the recognition they deserve. Can't wait for the CD release.
1,Save Your Money,"This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information."
1,NOT THE RIGHT ITEM FOR MY CAR!!!! INFINITI 2005 G35,When I chose the make an model of my car it told me it would fit my car. When I received it it did not.
4,hose reel,"After reading the reviews and having two previous water powered units(both of which were no good) I decidedto try this one. In reading the reviews I was concerned that some thought that it pulled out hard, then I saw thedates of the reviews(some a year or two old) and decided that the company must have fixed this problem by now.Sure enough it reals out very easily ... I'd recommend it to anyone... works great...Tom U. Silverton,Oregon"
3,"So far, so good","This hose reel is fairly compact, and attractive. I am a little worried about the plastic piece that you must lift up and down to engage and disengage the lock on the screw mechanism that lines the hose up on the reel. It seems like it will break off at some point. If it does, I guess I will just have to guide the hose back and forth while rewinding. The rewinding is pretty fast which surprised me. The battery life does not seem very long. I think next time I would try the kind that rewinds with water pressure rather than the battery type such as this one."
4,Automatic Hose Reel.,My wife is the gardener in the family. She likes this hose reel and uses it 2 -3 times a week.
1,Should have paid attention!,"We should have paid attention to those reviews that pointed up the difficulty in extracting the hose from this unit. The amount of tension (pull) required to simply unwind the hose is unacceptable. Damage to the unit, if it is secured, seems to be a likely outcome. C'mon folks, you've had enough complaints about this very issue....fix it. We returned our unit the day after purchase and will not be looking at other Suncast products in the future."
5,Insightful,"As a mother of a newly diagnosed breast cancer patient, I found this book to be extremely helpful in offering me a glimpse into the dynamics of this disease. The emotional and physical pain of the author brings to the forefront how very devastating this disease is to all involved. I have bought this book as gifts for friends who have been diagnosed after a survivor recommended it to me."
1,Please,"I won't go through what everyone else has already said about this book, but I found it to be consistently quite poor on the biblical interpritation and exigesis of the passages she uses, (especially 1 Corinthians 7) and the rest is mostly her opinion. This book is a merely one woman's opinion with little to no proof or backing biblical or otherwise. Someof her myths that she takes to task need to be, and she does point out how out culture's view of marriage has crept into the church, but mostly this book echos the ticking of a biological clock and its good points certainly do not outway the multitude of errors and bias in this book."
3,Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our History,I choose this rating because I have this book but I have not as yet read it. However I have read one of Kati Marton's books and discovered what an excellent writer she is. I am sure I will enjoy it when time permits.
1,Anti-Semitic Garbage,"This is an Anti-Semitic piece of garbage. There is no truth to this trash at all. It is well documented that the early Catholic Church stared anti-semitism in its teachings and even published same in its books. This ""book"" just continues the anti-Semitic view the church has had for centuries. The author claims to be an authority on the subject, however in truth he knows nothing about Judaism or the Torah. This ""book"" is an anti-Semitic hate manual."
1,I,"A previous reviewer says:""You are called men, but the Goyim [Gentiles] are not called men."" -Kerituth 6b; ""The progeny of the Goyim is like an animal."" -Sanhedrin 74b Tosephoth; ""All Gentile children are animals."" -Yebamoth 98aI presume that these alleged quotations are taken from the Pranaitis book. However, I went to the online Talmud site recommended by another pro-Pranaitis reviewer(...)and discovered that these alleged quotations do not exist. And, no, this is not some special ""sanitized"" Talmud. It's a Jewish web site, and most of the passages in question aren't even talking about Gentiles at all. The alleged quotations are pure fiction."
1,inaccurate,"The author is either ignorant of basic Aramaic translation or purposely inciting hate. Many of the terms he uses like ""apostates"" in the Talmud does not refer to Christians, as he contends. Also the Talmud uses the word ""akum"" which refers to idol worshipers. Christians are not included in this terminology."
5,"I expected a lot, but this exceeds all my expectations! 5++","I have always been a huge fan of Albert King, but this recording is sheer magic. Both he and Stevie are at the height of their powers here, and the interplay and mutual respect between them is absolutely awe inspiring. Albert calls each tunes as the session roles on and Stevie matches him on every turn, even when he is not familiar with the tune. The banter between the songs is priceless. When Stevie plays an Albert King lick, Albert says: ""Play that again...That sounds familiar."" At another point Albert shows him a tune he thinks he should include on his next LP (Matchbox Blues). After they play it he says ""You can probably do something with that...but change it like you want it."" Wonderful stuff.I saw Stevie back when he was still playing small clubs in the early eighties and this was how he sounded then. This is one of the best live recordings I have ever heard."
4,Good Pair,"These two make a good pair. Music is really good. Some talking in there, but overall, good cd.Came new as advertised."
4,4.5 stars,"I've been known to find cooperative efforts between guitar masters to be less than fulfilling, likely due to the high expectations I have from seeing two such names on an album cover. This, however, is an exception. Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan, mentor and protege, play the Hell outta these blues! And there's little doubt that they're having a great time doing so, playing some classic blues selections, with the notable appearance of Vaughan's own ""Pride and Joy"" and King's ""Blues at Sunrise.""All in all, it's a great, fun blues album, featuring two of the masters."
4,Stevie and Albert,"Great CD - great songs, great performances, and interesting dialogue clips between some tracks. Highlights are Stormy Monday, Pride and Joy (SRV's only vocal), and the long, simmering Blues at Sunrise.I bought this CD primarily because of SRV, however, after I couldn't stop listening to it over and over again, I started collecting several Albert King titles - the classic Born Under a Bad Sign, Hard Bargain, Live Wire, the Stax Profile. All are consistently excellent and recommended if you enjoy this session."
1,I guess I'm just tone deaf !!,"I read the first 26 reviews with increasing concern about my hearing ability. Then, finally, the 27th reviewer asked, ""does no one hear that Albert is out of tune...?"" Come on, folks! I've been a blues fan for 40 years and have given my sweat, tears and $$ to see, hear and experience America's real classical music. The facts are the facts and the fact is, Albert is DREADFULLY out of tune throughout the entire session.It is so bad that I finally had to get rid of my copy. It broke my heart that Albert couldn't stand up for himself and retract that piece of trash. Those who experienced an Albert King show know full well that if Albert didn't like it IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!Albert didn't take any s**t from anyone. This disc is an insult to Albert, Stevie and every serious fan of the blues."
3,"A solid, but unspectacular compilation of "" New Flamenco""","While this CD contains works form such great bands and artists as Ketama, Pata Negra, and Aurora, overall it was rather tepid. Most of the songs, while solid, were unispiring. This is all the more suprising given the quality of the artists on this disc. i would recommend the ""Nuevo Flamenco"" disc over this compliation. I would recommend Jvenes Flameco mainly to fans of the aforementioned artists and not to the casual listener or the merely curious."
5,Great face lotion!,"I've been using this product for over 6 months, and I love it. It leaves my skin feeling smooth but not greasy, and offers great sun protection to boot. Love it and highly reccomend!"
4,Good Product,When I remember to use this product the next day my face feels smooth and soft. It is a remarkable difference.
4,James Bond is Born Again,"Jean Claude Van Damme brings to the screen a combination of 007 adventure andscience fiction. I sat glued to my chair and watched all four films on four different days. It is really amazing how one man can portray over and over againwhat it means to be a fighter again evil whether it is today, yesterday, ortommorow. This type of film is not for everyone; but, it certainly, filled anitch in my viewing habits; so, if you enjoy good against evil stories watch thisaction pack with four films in it."
3,Van Damme Action Pack Quadruple Feature,"This is a great action pack - martial arts action, with some story line.Bring back memories if you saw them the first time around."
5,An old standard favorite,"This dictionary is an old standard favorite which has been brought up to date. I believe the first edition of it was published in the sixties. It provided a great deal of basic knowledge of Judaism.It needs however to be supplemented by more intense study of particular entries, that is for anyone interested in knowing the subject in question, comprehensively."
5,A beautiful DVD!,"I have had this product for several months and I watch it every morning with my breakfast meal.I recently ordered a faux fishaquarium and when I plugged it in, I was appalled to see how fake it looked.I gave it away and put my DVD back on.Its quiteamazing how these expensive aquariums can't compare to this wonderful and reasonable DVD."
5,"Beautiful, Natural Looking Aquariums","I was a bit overwhelmed when I started looking for an aquarium DVD. After reading loads of reviews, I actually selected Plasma Candy's because I have their Fireplace DVD and liked the tank images I saw.My criteria was very specific. I wanted loads of fish. I wanted scenes that made my TV look like an aquarium...not like I was chasing fish around the ocean. In addition, I prefer more natural looking plants and rocks as backgrounds, and I just didn't see that in the screen shots of other aquarium DVDs.I have one small complaint. I wish it was in Blu Ray. However, many of my friends who have seen it said they thought it was HD. I do have to give 5 stars though, as everyone who has seen it playing on my TV says they love it and ask me where they can get one."
4,Be careful doing this -- and you might want to change it,"The presentation for this trick contains a step that could allow an alert viewer to determine how the trick is done. The materials (cups and balls) are fine, but the instructions are dubious... you might want to look up alternate techniques for performing this."
4,Great Wallet,"My son got this wallet for me for my birthday. I love it, It is perfect for all my coupns, gift cards, reward cards and all the other little items that I keep im my purse. The clasp stuck a little when I first got it but seems to be fine know. Perfect size for me."
4,slow down,"This is an interesting book, but (against its wisdom) I flipped rapidly through the final half. I'm sorry about that!"
4,great sounds,"Talking Timbuktu is a conversation between jazz and traditional West African music, likely the grandfather of jazz. Wonderful rhythms, great improvisation and evocative emotional expression."
3,African blues,"It's eerily amazing how musicians continents away can produce similar music. Many of the songs have long preludes before the vocals come in and I found myself almost wanting the cd to be instrumental, the rhythm is so awesome. Ry Cooder meshes well with Ali Toure and his ensemble being sure not to overpower the traditional tune, but nevertheless his sound is not lost in the mix. I bought the CD for Ai Du featured in movie Unfaithful but ended up liking many others with that similar groove. This cd is a risk for listeners not open to stretching their concept of the blues due to it's repetitious Malian vocals. In my opinion it's a risk worth taking."
3,One of Syfy's better films (That's not saying much...),"The sharks actually take a minor role in this particular romp...the plot is fairly well developed and delivers more of an ""Angels and Demons"" feel than that of a killer shark flick. The use of real sharks in most scenes was refreshing as opposed to Syfy's usual low-tech CG. Solid performances by the cast in general."
4,"Finally, decent music again!","This is a fantastic selection. Starlight Dolphin successfully blends the elements of classical, new age, and good old 60's surf music into a form of music that is wonderful to listen to. Children will love the quirky Penguin Talk while teens will get into the surf feel of Wild Ride. King and Jahr have created songs that will make you up beat but mellow you out at the same time. This is a cd you will enjoy no matter what type of music you listen to. All will like this CD."
4,A very fine book on horseracing angles.,"The book covers alot of ground. Provides some interesting methods to playing horses, as well as covering both Thoroughbreds and Harness Racing. The book mostly deals with showing you, how to eliminating losers. There is some very interesting information here. Money Management is cover very lightly, as well as some systems. The closing chapter provides some interesting facts about horseracing. Overall a very good book."
2,nice monitor... poor quality,"These monitors looked like a great buy for the price. I figured NEC would be a good safe brand. I bought 8 of them in Dec 2001 and just had a 3rd one go bad as of today. Now NEC says they have a ... backlog on sending out a replacement monitor and the best option is to send it in for repair (about 2 weeks). At least they have a 3 year warranty. I ended up buying a 9th monitor as a spare but now I have two in the shop :( Oh ya, everytime one goes bad it costs me [money] in shipping."
4,"Solid Content, Poor Production Quality","It's a shame that this book couldn't have been cleaned up a bit. The translation is awkward, and the pictures are too light. Having said that, I must admit that I really like this book. Books on Hsing-i are not as hard to find as they used to be, but most today choose to cover the same old material. The five fists are included here, as well as the twelve animals, but the author goes on to further cover a couple of forms not available in other English language books. The photos are excellent in CONTENT, but as I said before, they're too light. Still one may overlook the shortcomings of the book and concentrate on the positives. This book would be best read after reading Robert W. Smith's book on the same topic (preferably the original version, if you can find it)."
4,Love Conquers,"I won't go into all that this movie is about because if you have not seen it; I'm sure you have already read about it.I liked this movie for several reasons. One is the humor that waS provided by Robin Williams in his role as Mrs. Doubtfire. It was outstanding, but aside from that I think the film made another point. It showed that things always do not work out exactly how we may want them to and that we need to understand that and I feel the movie also showed the importance of love, understanding and compassion between people. That's pretty good for one movie, don't you think. I recommend this movie for your entire family."
1,"Funny the first time, but horrible after that","The first couple times I saw this it was hilarious. Now I hate it, it's one of those that gets too old too soon. I don't know what is. I just don't like this movie that much....sorry...."
2,Doubtful...Very Doubtful!,"This reviewer thinks David Spade on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE's ""Weekend Update"" summed up MRS. DOUBTFIRE best when he states, ""I liked this movie the first time...when it was called 'TOOTSIE'!"" Another in a line of Robin Williams movies (i.e. GOOD MORNING VIETNAM, HOOK, etc.) in which what starts out as a comedy wanders into sappy territory and the film falls flat. Also, Robin Williams looks grotesque in drag."
3,the 3 stars are unusual for a crossdresser flick,"robin williams runs amuck in his most natural type of role............feminine.his ol lady divorces him after she meets her old boyfriend at work,the same day.so the crazy (...) dad dresses up like a chick to be with his kids.its very very gay but funny.robin williams plays a lot of gay characters.just look at the thanks for everything movie-birdcage-and a few others.he must really like playing chicks.its emotional in places showing just how bloodthirsty and underhanded a woman can be when she smells blood.the verbal parts are abselutely hilarioius.other than that its a real downer!"
4,Adidas Revo pant,"They are very comfortable and fit very well, despite the crotch is a bit long for me. These are perfect for the gym, running, and use daily. I recommend them 100%"
1,A Dated Book Full of Sterotypes,"As a college student from Appalachia writing about my area, I found a suprising lack of contemporary research and writing on Appalachia, even in my Ivy League college's library. Yesterday's People, although written in 1980, uses books from the late 1800s and early 1900s for some of its sources. Comments include things like, ""raised in a society of so much 'known', there is little stimulation--there is no desire or skill for meeting the new and different."" and ""Childhood seems to be only a waiting period until adulthood is attained, adolescence is in many ways the high point of life."" While some of the sterotypes Weller speaks of in this book are generally true, I feel that there are too many misinformed opinions for this book to be of much worth. It is dangerous for this book to be an ""outsider's"" only source of knowledge on the beautiful and rich culture of Appalachia."
4,Pretty good.,"Where this book gets into a little trouble is when it gets away from martial arts. The author says not to use your neck to check your pulse. I have a first aid book that says to do that. My PE teacher showed me to do that. I have been doing that for years and have never passed out. I think the author has taken too many death touch courses. Striking a vital point is different than pressing against it. Part of the book is on self defense. If you want to read a truly great book on self defense then read facing violence. The core of the book is sound, being a martial arts student and the history of martial arts."
5,Good for all geeks,"At first, the t-shirt usually gets a confused look, and then intense scrutiny. And, at least for those that are reasonably mathematically inclined, you then usually get a hearty laugh."
4,"Excellent, but prohibitively expensive","I have lived and worked in a Russian speaking country for the past two years. When I arrived I had a relative send me Russian I. I found the process of speaking and listening and repeating very effective and even caught myself thinking in Russian after working through tapes. I would hear things on the street then hear them in the lessons and think, gee, so that's what that means. I quickly developed an ability to take the grammar framework and plug new words in. The speakers on the tapes enunciated clearly and at a perfect rate for me to develop new skills. In my opinion the program works as advertised.My only complaints are that the language was a little more formal than what I needed in my particular situation and the lessons were too expensive for me to afford Russian II or III, which could have helped me a great deal."
4,not quite the monster disk the first one was,"more from the djs at the late lamented mambo inn. this time the tour starts in brazil across the ocean to west africa and then back across the ocean to the caribbean. fewer remixes heavier emphasis on latin music than the first, so the lower rating my be interpreted purely as a matter of personal taste. your mileage may vary.standout track: baaba maal ""hamady boiro"" total rhythmic drive with macka b toasting a short history of senegal for those of us who are not fluent in woloff. if you can't dance to this you might want to check with your cardiologist because in all likelihood you are dead. other standout track: wagadu gu's epic note-for-note better production values weighing in at 14 minutes plus version of prince nico's ""sweet mother,"" complete with the two guitarists playing in different keys during one of the guitar breaks. ""you can get another wife, but can you get another mother? nooooo!!!!"""
4,Sci-Fi action with great stars,"I like this movie because it brought so many things I like to the table. The stars: Emilio Estevez, Mick Jagger, Rene Russo, Anthony Hopkins. The action: F1 racing, futuristic cars & chases, space guns & gear. The romance between Emilio & Rene. The psychedelic images at the end, etc. Definitely worth watching."
1,This answered my question,FREEJACK is on my list of Top Ten Worst Movies I'v ever seen. I've been seeing so many four- and five-star ratings for things on Amazon that I thought I'd look p something truly horrific and see if people really had general bad taste.They do.
1,Over priced. Tiny paper booklet.,Some Good information but so over priced it is not funny! Tiny paper booklet. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"If you are interested in info on building a deck, spend your money on a good D.I.Y. book from your local home improvement store. This software is genuinely worthless. It is just a simple CAD program, and if you know CAD you dont need this, if you dont know CAD, you will not be able to use this. Read the reviews and believe them!"
3,"""Coach"" (1978)","plot outline:A young, blonde, and beautiful athlete is hired to coach a team of underachieving high school basketball players. Against all odds, she transforms them into a winning team."
3,Did you know........?,"I have this cd, but I have the release #1 that was put out June 4, 1996. For some reason you can't buy it anymore as far as I could find. The second cd is the only difference between the first release and the second. I can't seem to find any of the tracks that are on the second cd anywhere else except here on amazon but only the audio cassette. Here is what the #1 release looks like if anyone is interested[...]1. Girl With the Sun in Her Head2. P.E.T.R.O.L.3. Box, Pt. 14. Box, Pt. 25. Dwr Budr6. Adnan's7. Out There Somewhere?8. Out There Somewhere?Disc: 21. Times Fly (Slow) 7:582. Sad But New 7:293. Times Fly (Fast)7:534. The Tranquilizer 6:275. The Box 28:11I love the second cd, especially the last track it's almost a half an hour long.I never knew until now that the first cd's tracks had titles the front of cd that I have is pretty blank.The tracks on the second cd are listed on the front. I don't know why for some reason the tracks are listed on one but not the other."
2,Mediocre,The author attempts to place Holmes in a number of real life cases and scandals but fails to capture neither the essence of the Holmes character or Doyle's writing style. All in all a rather flat and dry read.
3,slow going,"At first I thought this book would be intriguing, unfortunatly it was not a page turner, I almost had to force myself to finish the book. And the author had the gall to insinuate that Holmes' would murder to solve a case. Not really worth reading."
5,Truly interesting,"I'm most impressed with the way Mr. Irwin handles the snakes. Even with a few close calls, I say he's definately a snake charmer!"
4,Almost a 5 star,"I ordered this book after reading Tyson's wonderful ""Death by Black Hole"" without knowing it was an autobiography.Overall, I enjoyed learning about Tyson's life path from a childhood interest in astronomy to becoming an acclaimed astrophysicist. Included are tales of how being black adversely influenced several life experiences. Fair enough. On the flip side, I wouldn't be too surprised if some of his extraordinary opportunities were due in part to his ethnicity.That said, Tyson is a true original, and his books are well worth reading."
3,Not what I had anticipated,"I would not classify the book as totally ""boring"". I was able to jot down several thought-provoking, enlightening comments from the read. Chad Wise offered an entertaining perspective and I would rate him as a good writer. However Thurman, while I respect his wealth of knowledge on Tibetan Buddhism, came across as demanding and overbearing. I just couldn't relate to him. I purchased the book because I am soon making a spiritual pilgrimage to Mt. Kailash, and hoped to read more about the spiritual experiences of the two writers than was offered. Maybe that is not translatable into words. The book did give me more knowledge on Tibetan Buddhism, and that I do appreciate."
4,Interesting Articles on Folk Medicine,"The articles in this book are intriguing and well-written. They deal with ways to understand traditional and unorthodox health practices within their own communities. The writers are especially interested in relationships between scientific medicine and alternative/complementary medicine. There is a great range of approaches and interests, and the book provides numerous ways to examine how various types of knowledge are valued and devalued in relation to health care. My major critique of the overall project is that it doesn't fully deal with the tension between the need to engage in scientific inquiry while working to understand traditional health care beliefs and practices that stand in contrast to scientific methods and theories."
4,A Good Storage Bench,"We got this storage bench to keep sports equipment in at our motel. We have set it up near our volleyball net and it holds the volleyballs, badmitten rackets and shuttlecocks, frisbees and yard darts. It keeps everything out of the weather and seems to work very well."
2,Cheap plastic,It is not too bad for use as a storage box outside but whenever anyone other than my kids sit on it the entire lid/seat bows in and I'm afraid it going to break. I wouldn't suggest anyone weighing more than 150lbs sit on it often.
5,attractive and functional,When we were unable to find what we wanted here on the central coast of California we went on line and found exactly what we were looking for on Amazon.com. We wanted a bench for our front entryway which not only looked nice but had a storage area in the bottom where packages could be left. This fills our needs nicely. The bench arrived in a timely manner and was easy to assemble.
2,"Looks Nice, But...","I purchased the Suncast Patio Bench about a month ago - I had planned on using it to store our patio chair cushions when it rained. And, although the cushions did fit into it nicely, when we had our first rainfall all of the cushions got sopping wet and there was about 6"" of water in the bottom.This may be fine if you're just looking to purchase something that will go with your outdoor decor for some extra seating, but if you plan on using it to protect your cushions (or any other items) from the rain, I would not recommend it.Because of the problems we had with this Suncast Patio Bench, I wound up purchasing the Suncast Deck Storage Box with Seat & Gas Spring Lid Mechanism and this one works wonderful! It's not only a lot roomier, but it keeps everything in it protected from the elements."
1,Not too happy...,"This bench/storage leaks like a sieve. Had rain on Monday, and didn't check it for a couple of days, and all the cushions were mildewed! Had too turn it over to dump the water! OK for outdoor toys but not cushions! Would return it if it wasn't so much trouble to take it apart."
2,NOT Watertight!,"This product was packaged well and I put it together in 15 minutes. However, it is NOT water tight. I put it together and put it out on my back porch. That night it rained. I went out the next morning and looked inside the storage area. There was about three gallons of water inside. So I have a nice plastic seat, however, I can not use it for what I wanted, which was keeping my charcoal in it."
4,Patio Bench,"The price was right, The bench was larger than I expected which was a nice thing. It went together easily and works great. The company does not list measurements on the Amazon web site and I think they would sell more of them through Amazon if they did."
2,Good device needs a few improvements,"I was happy with the sound and the features of this thing, but it had two annoying attributes I couldn't get past, and I returned it. First, the display did not have a dim setting that was dim enough for sleeping. I had to turn the display to the off setting at night. Second, the display constantly scrolled the iLuv brand name and the features of the device, and there was no way to turn off the scrolling! I don't need an alarm clock with a constantly scrolling advertisement on it."
4,Purchase was perfect,Needed this book for a college course I had and it was just what I need. It was less expensive than buying at the bookstore. So I save alot of money and was able to buy some other supplies.
2,A time management tool that sucks up time,"I've been searching for a digital version of the Franklin Covey paper binder method ever since my palm pilot expired and smartphones took over.What's to love about FC methods?- The ability to break down projects into tasks, or steps- The ability to sync with google and outlook calanders- The ability to assign each task a priority that will fit into your workday- The weekly compass card!What's to love about plan plus online (I didn't purchase the software, and am glad)?- A design template that is so ugly, so difficult to read and rigid. Don't even think about customization of the basic PP online account.- Clumsy function and poor user interface- Slow as frozen molassesI had the basic online plan that was $15 a month.I cancelled it and purchased the Awesome Calendar app."
5,Perfect Little Kit,"Great kit for cleaning your 9mm pistol. Includes most everything needed. The brass rod feels very sturdy! I would recommend this to anyone, from the first time owner to the gun collector!"
2,Rather overrated,"Of merit primarily for its historical value as being on the few synthesized scores to win an Academy Award. Aside from its well-know theme (pure sugar), the musical gist is average, the sparkly effects are mindnumbing... the good performances (by Vangelis himself, naturally [practically the only thing natural here]) helps prevent it from sounding like some sort of upscale ""Samuel 'Silly' Sidney and his Sister Sarah's Salacious Synth Sounds"" monstrosity."
5,Experience Excellence,"I loved the movie when it was first released several years ago -- and I love this music.Granted, the music reaches its utmost eminence when you can summon in your mind the scenes of driven men who are so focused on a goal... a gold medal.However, even if you have never had the good fortune of seeing this wonderful move the music is a work in excellence in its own right!"
4,Amazing stories of an amazing breed and an exceptional individual member of that breed,"I liked this book. It gave me what I wanted, which is a recounting of events in and surrounding the life of the famous mountain man John Johnson. I found it compelling reading. On the other hand don't expect great literature. The writing and language are ""rough."" It does flow well, however.In quotes from interviews of certain of John's friends and other contemporaries, there are things like certain characterizations of Native Americans in general and of specific tribes that some may find offensive. In fact if I were to hear someone say them today, I would find them offensive. Given the context of these quotes, however, I was able to simply accept them as indicative of the mentality of these men during these times. It's worth noting that many of these same men (including Johnson) had close friends who were Indians and had Indian wives."
5,The saga of Liver-Eating Johnson,"I purchased this book with the same expectations that I have always had while shopping with amazon.com. As always, the product came exactly as described and I would not hesitate to do business again. A+++"
4,It ain't the movie,"This is an unusual book with lots of interesting stories but probably requires a specialty audience. The writing style is very different from your standard novel. It is a collection of stories taken down from people who were with John Johnson and then arranged basically in as cronological an order as possible or arranged by topic. For someone who is mountainman buff or is otherwise familiar with the historic time period, it is a great insight into the life and hardships of these men and women. One of the characteristics of many westerners was the art of understatement and that shows up in the retelling of these stories and so reading between the lines is helpful. As a history teacher, I enjoyed the book. If you are looking for a romantic extention of the movie ""Jeramiah Johnson,"" this ain't it."
5,Smart love:control with love not by discipline,"I was a disciplinarian by necessity not by choice -- it is important to me that my children be well socialized and polite. Until I read Smart Love, I thought that the only way to have a well-behaved child was to use lectures, time-outs, and consequences for improper behavior. Smart love showed me that there is a way to govern my children that is not permissive but also doesn't require disciplinary measures. Moreover, as the authors argue, the smart love way is better than discipline because it teaches them to want to care for themselves and others and doesn't teach them that might makes right. This kind and humane approach has already made a big difference in our family. Smart love lays out clear guidelines and offers many practical examples to help parents understand and apply this uniquely effective method."
3,"I wish there was a much narrower band, but the puzzle pieces are perfect","The band is pretty thick, but the inside is nicely smoothed and edges rounded for comfort. The puzzle pieces are subtle but clearly there. I just wish that this came in 3mm and 4mm for those of use who prefer a more narrow band. We have the 6mm band as well, and it's still a little thick for us."
3,Defective Product,"I bought this a year ago based on reviews I read, but was very disappointed.Initially started with issues with the power switch (the slider). It would not turn on. The second issue was I could not transfer files to the player. The software would not recognize the portable device.I had to send it back to Samsung, they fixed the issues, but every now and then, even when fully charged, the unit does not power on.Sound is great and looks are great, but has firmware and hardware issues. I will think twice before buying another of these."
5,Very good introduction to Implicit Surfaces,"Don't expect this book to be anything like a bible on implicit surfaces. But if you are looking for a way to get quickly accustomed to the existing work, it's definitely the right book. You will find lots of pointers, in a wide range of related subjects."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I received this as a gift, and that was great because I have been needing them for a while. Unfortunately only four from the first set of ten batteries had a full charge; the rest had from 1.32 to 1.48 volts. If the failure rate on the other 40 turns out to be the same, I won't be too bothered because overall it was still cheaper than buying them locally."
4,Another great book from these authors,I just keep on enjoying these novals when I have the time. I always look forward for new books with the same story arc.
3,Totally Arthur C. Clarke,"Reading this book I felt I was reading Rama Return again. It felt like the collaboration was a few sprinkles of hard science every now and then. And then, the second book was totally Baxter. The last book is the only one that resembles a collage of styles: Clarke writes Mir, Baxter writes Earth, and then they join chapters.The whole saga is ok, but it is neither author's best work."
2,"Interesting, risk-taking outing yields no treasures...","The same outfit (or most of these same musicians) assembled by Ashley Hutchings created something far more memorable on the sadly and unacceptably deleted ""Son Of Morris On"" (EMI catalogue number 7243 8 29861 2 6"", or sometimes listed in a shorter form as EMI 29861), a 1976 follow-up to earlier ""Morris On"". ""Prospect"" tries to reach for something, and although nothing really drags here, there are no precious jewels of songs either. If you must, try ""Battle Of The Field"" or ""Rise Up Like The Sun"", each worth about 3 stars in my book. ""Son Of Morris On"", also featuring Hutchings with John Tams, Simon Nicol, Martin Carthy, Shirley Collins Hutchings, Phil Pickett and others, though, is really the one that should have been re-issued by Rykodisc. That was musical greatness on a high scale, and it's a shame it's not around anymore. See if you can find a nice vinyl copy of that if that's the only format you can find it on - still worth it!"
5,Lo mejor de Fiel a la Vega!,"Fiel a la Vega son los mejores en el genero. Este es el cuarto disco del grupo pero el primero internacional. El disco esta brutal. ""Tres"" es simplemente otro exito mas para Fiel a la Vega. A Tito, Ricky, Jorge, Papo, y Pedro, los integrantes mucho exito."
2,I expected more...,"I'm a big Edguy fan. So when I had the chance to listen to ""Eggi""'s solo effort, I was anxious to hear it. I haven't heard the entire album, but the tracks I've heard were disappointing. The music itself is OK, but nothing extraordinary. The vocalist ruins it for me. Granted, Tobi Sammet is practically a vocal god. The lead singer for Taraxacum sounds like a weak Joey Tempest (80's era Europe) knockoff at times, and at the high end of his range (out of his range if you ask me) sounds like Geddy Lee from Rush. Not good.Based on what I've heard, I wouldn't bother with this one. Sorry Eggi!"
3,You were expecting a 4-Star movie ... with CHARO???,"Yes, this stellar cast incudes that 70's icon Charo. Anything with her can't be expected to be taken too seriously...or can it? At least she had the good sense to get off the Concorde when some of the others decided to go ahead and stay for the second half of the trip. She had the ""sense"" to leave when she couldn't bring her chihuahua onboard. Tell me now, would you have wanted to go on with the trip after what happended in the first half? ;) Coochi, coochi poochie. Anyway, the movie is a piece of rainy afternoon ""fluff"". I wouldn't take it to seriously -- very forgetable & just for laughs. A DVD would be nice, though. Just to complete my ""Airport"" set. Question... when Susan Blakely's charactor got in the taxi in Paris after her break-up with her arms dealing boyfriend, where did the dog come from and where did it go? Looks to me like it got in the taxi with her -- just wondering. :)"
1,VERY BORING!!!,"All I can say is that this is probably the worst disaster film of all time, what got me confused and annoyed at the same time was silly additonal chatacters such as the jive ass with the saxophone,""We're Triplets,"" and the woman with the small bladder, ""The Bathroom's Broken."" And of course, Charo, ""My hands Cold."" Even George Kennedy's acting was off, but none of his bad acting in other films will be as bad as his acting in Airport 75! I think the Airport series should have stopped with Airport 77, I feel so bad now for even watching this film once, I definetly think this is a disaster movie gone wrong!"
5,One of my Favorites,"I first smelled this cologne when my niece bought a small sample size for my birthday. It came in a package with 4 other colognes. This was definitely my favorite out of all 5. When the sample was gone, I bought 2 full size bottles. Probably one of my favorite colognes all of time. Seems that its discontinued and somewhat hard to find now. I definitely couldnt find it in any store, and even online its scarce."
5,Excellent Educational Tool,"This film is a powerful portrayal of the AIDS crisis in Africa which depicts 5 individuals who go about fighting the disease each with a unique approach. The ""film"" is actually a series of still photpgraphs which are narrated by the individuals portrayed. It is exceptionally well done and keeps the viewers' attention. I am a high school teacher and used this film in a Human Rights class - the students were moved by the film and I recommend it to all interested in gaining further perspective on the crisis in Africa."
3,Regina could be better,I like Carlos Jobin's music a lot so I was expecting this C.D.to be more exciting. I thought collection of music was rather poor and Regina sings with less fire. She could be better.
2,Disappointed,"I'm sorry, but I must disagree with all of the previous reviewers. When I look for latin jazz, I expect something that has at least a little swing and groove to it. While I am not intending to disparage Elis Regina and I am a fan of Jobim, this album, with a few exceptions, is a bunch of sad songs sung in portugese. It is not at all what I was expecting. Be warned that it is NOT in the vein of the Sinatra/Jobim albums, the Getz/Jobim albums, etc... Some may welcome the lack of orchestral accompaniments - for me, this was a disappointment. My feeling is that while Elis has a nice, vulnerable sounding voice, it is too thin to carry the effort by itself, which it seems to be expected to do based on these arrangements. Sorry, gang, don't shoot me - just my opinion."
4,Just okay.,I really enjoy these books because I love anything Alias-related. I did enjoy this book BUT Sydney was just whiny and insecure. Nothing like she is on the show. Take out all the silly whiny parts and it would have been a lot more readable.
5,Paul Lindsays First Novel,"For a first book it was a killer. Lindsay was an FBI agent for 20 years, and he knew his subject very well. He also can write. I haven't found one of his books that I didn't enjoy. I heartily recommend anything by this excellent author. He also used the pen name Noah Boyd."
4,Good beans for baked beans recipe,"I found a recipe that called for these dry beans (you obviously soak them overnight) in a baked beans recipe. The beans were fairly expensive (like 5 bucks) but the killer was the shipping fees. The beans were good (you even put beer in the recipe with brown sugar, honey, molasses, etc.) but not for the price I paid to get them to me. There are other beans in the supermarket that will work as well."
1,BORING!,"I have to admit that I am not finished the book yet. I am on page 59 and I don't think I want to read anymore. This book is so boring and uninteresting. The author writes like I am in 6th grade and gives too many details of stupid, common sense things. EX:""With only a twinge of guilt, Linda lifted the receiver and stuck it into a drawer. It would make disturbing noises for a few seconds, then go mute. Anyone calling would get a busy signal."" DUH! Why did she need to go into detail with that? She has many more of these boring details all throughout the book. My advice...don't buy it or wait to buy it at a yardsale for $.25."
2,Very predictable; boring and trite,"Uninteresting and boring. I finished this book to see what happened, but I wished I had not started it. Much more entertaining books out there."
5,Flash is the best - and so is this training,"If you're serious at ALL about webdesign, you need to know Flash. It's basically the standard for anything cool you want to do in web design.And this program kicks ass. It starts at the very beginning, showing you how to use all the tools --and by the end you're making butterflies animate, and you feel like you could really create just about anything and make it move. Very cool stuff --and if you're a professional, clients will LOVE the tricks you pick up with this program."
3,Mass Production,"These short stories are not among Stout's best, although they are eminently readable. Stout published these first in magazines, and then collected them into books like this one.""Cop Killer,"" like ""The Squirt and the Monkey,"" contains some really pulp-fiction cliches which were so widely read in the early 50s. These regreattably date the efforts without adding any asccertainable sharm.However, ""Home to Roost"" is actually pretty good, managing to avoid the trap into which the other stories fell. So, instead of two stars, we average up to three...Hopefully these will be released on CD or download soon; I'd love to hear Michael Prichard read them without paying fifty smackers for cassettes which have beomce increasingly unplayable..."
3,"Not Bad, But Not the Best","Few of Stout's collection of his short stories are as good as his novels. It seems to me that there's always something artificial or forced in the plotting of the short stories: as if there's a word limit and the author just pushes the story along so it fits the limit. The one I liked the best was ""The Cop-Killer,"" because I thought it it had the strongest plot, involving the barbershop that Archie and Nero frequent, two hit-and-run deaths, and the killing of a cop. This story had the strongest plot, and I enjoyed Nero's roundup of the suspects (in the barbershop, as he was being shaved).The other two stories, ""Home to Roost"" and ""The Squirt and the Monkey"" are not bad: I would never call any Rex Stout story bad. These two stories are enjoyable only because they're about Nero and Archie, not because they're strong stories in and of themselves."
1,Not as Advertised,"This product is described as 100% cotton. In fact, it is a 58% poly/42% cotton blend. I ordered specific colors and received all grey. Amazon needs to correct this listing and ensure that it delivers the products as advertised. I have had good luck over the years with Amazon, but will be reluctant to order any apparel in the future."
5,Cumbia-Mania!,"This disc is GREAT! I originally bought it for Track 13: Tu no Me Lo Das, and I love all the other songs on it. It's a great CD to start your day to or to get ready to hit the town. It really pumps you up! If you love cumbia, this CD is a must-have."
3,Sergeant Hartman...,"...has the Code 2 DVD. On this DVD Dolby 5.1 is not working very well. The Code 1 Version I haven't heard. I also have four DVD Players on three DD 5.1 Systems. And of all my 560 DVDs, the Manowar DVD is the only one that doesn't work right."
3,"Comfy shoes, but...","These shoes are amazingly comfortable! I'm on my feet all day working in fast food. However, I bought these in December 2011, and the sole is seperating from the rest of the shoe in less than six months. For the price I paid, I was really hoping they would last at least six months... Oh, well. But because they are so comfortable, I will be buying another pair."
5,a superb eagles compilation,"this is absolutely fantastic.i have had this compilation since 3 years and i absolutely love it.it contains my favourite song get over it and brilliant accoustic versions of hotel california,tequila sunrise and more.very highly recommended.five stars.an essential classic to own."
1,CD was not playable,"I received the cd within the time constraints. However, the cd was not in the condition promised. Four of the tracks were not playable. After sending an email disclosing the condition of the cd,the company did refund my money by reversing the charges on my credit card. I have ordered other items from this company and was happy with the purchases."
4,Nice Debut,You herd him on cam'rom album the dipamats it was time for himto come out solo it a nice album.pick it up
4,Okay Okay no one messing with Santana No Way!!!!!!!!,"This album is hot from the beggining to the end for real. I could not wait for this one to hit the streets. Santana out shines the rest of his diplomats with this album. He really proves him self with his taboo flow, rhymes and delivery. He even has old school tracks twisted to a updated version of beats delivered by the heatmakers who produced majority of the album (Beats are crazy and unbelievable!!!). Santana is the best he told yall before and with this album he shows it!! I will definitely buy any album he puts out!!!!"
4,Excellent Debut.,"Hot. I only gave it 4 stars though because of that ""Dipset Lets Get It On"" song. That's horrible.""Flutes? Man, bring in the opera.""No. Go cop it though."
4,Julez Is Without a Doubt What You Call Sick!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bannanas simply a hip hop classic this album got ever thing from street songs like ""Okay"" and ""Down"" to ""jealousy"" and ""How I Feel"" and many others cop this album yall wont be dissapointed trust me Julez You Sick Nucca One."
5,very good cuticle oil,"I ordered 3 bottles. I have to have one in each room. They work very well on dry nails in the dry heat and cold winter. I have been using this solar oil for 10 years, they work great!"
2,Who's the audience for this book?,"I bought this book simply because Amazon advertised it to me and it had good reviews. It obviously makes a connection to certain type of people (presumably ""extreme sensitives"") but it didn't do much for me. I found it hard to work out who the author was actually writing for. She didn't provide insights to assist troubled people, so clearly you have to actually attend her therapy program to benefit from her knowledge. Nor did she detail what she does in her therapy with horses, so you are left wondering exactly what is happening in the round yard. I suppose if you are on the inside (ie part of the horse-assisted therapy community) this book will mean more to you than it did to me. I tried to have an open mind but sorry, I ended the book not feeling at all convinced that horses are somehow in tune with the real meaning of life just like yogis."
3,Uneven toast,This toaster was rated the best or second best in two reviews I read. One of which was Consumer's Report. I was disappointed that it did not toast the bread evenly on both sides and also uneven on one side.
5,DMTS Inside Flash MX Rocks!!,"DMTS Inside Flash MX was the best training experience I've had in a long time. The instructor is terrific. The lessons easy to understand and apply. I plan to use DMTS products in the future, if this is typical of their quality. I'm amazed at how far this training has taken me and in such a short time period. In one weekend using Flash MX, I feel like a pro. Thank you DMTS."
4,Good introductory book!,"Chinese painting is full of wonders. While three thousand years in one volume seems quite ambitious, this book provides an useful introduction to the subject with clear historical outlines and good selection of images. I would think that the texts sometimes might appear lacking of details and thorough researches to students and scholars of Chinese art, but they would still appreciate large and good quality color reproductions and well-organized structure of the book."
5,What a great product!,"When I first started turning,I sharpened my tools by hand. Once I started using this tool, decreased my sharpening time. I also don't know how I ever made it with out it."
4,My daughter's favorite car-ride book,"My daughter LOVES this book for short car rides- half an hour or so. She doesn't go to daycare AND she's an only child so she doesn't see other babies except from the seat of a shopping cart when we run errands or in the park. So she LOVES this book and laughs and coos at the babies on the pages. My only complaint, and this is really small since she doesn't actually READ the book, she just looks at the babies faces, but some of the baby faces don't look like the describing words on the facing page. If you want this book to teach your baby describing words, this isn't the best one, but just for the pictures, it's very cute and entertaining for baby.***EDIT Note: My daughter is 2.5 now and she still LOVES this book!!! Will be getting one for my friends why they start having babies too!!!"
1,My husband threw it away!,I had heard that books like these would be beneficial for babies to recognize faces. The problem with this one is that most of the faces are sad / negative. My husband threw it out - didn't even want to give it away!
5,a very relatable journey in a very foreign land,"i saw this documentary in the theater as i was (still am) a huge fan of the TV show. Though you absolutely don't need to be familiar with the TV show to thoroughly enjoy it, i think it makes it even funnier. i think everybody can relate to a story where you are trying to convey simple ideas and simple concepts with your best will and patience and you can't get through anybody, you only get to frustration and bewilderment. then you start trying to understand who you're dealing with in order to break through the culture clash. This clash is conveyed honestly and skillfully and that's what makes Exporting Raymond so hilarious and enjoyable to watch. i feel i've been to Moscow and back and only paid the price of a movie ticket."
5,It's a documentary!,"I didn't realize this was a documentary but luckily it's very funny. I'm not a fan of the show so I'm not biased in my assessment; the guy (is it Phil?) is extremely funny in this documentary.Everything comes together well and reveals the cultural divide between the US and Russia that most people don't bother to know or look up. It also reveals the cultural similarities, the universal nature of comedy, and the unnaturally unfunny/sense of humor-less types of people involved in creating comedy both in Russia and the US."
2,TOO SPECIFIC!,"I bought this book thinking it would be a great coffee-table book for my theatrical home. I even thought I could use it for trivia games with my theatre students. But it only focuses on 10 movies - one for each chapter. And the trivia questions are for people who are obsessed with that particular film. I was hoping for a book full of fun, random questions about a wide array of movie musicals, but this book is not that. However, if you've watched Wizard of Oz 50 times, this would be the perfect book for you!"
4,Very Interesting,"When I downloaded this book I was thinking it was a different book. As I got into it I was having a hard time putting it down. Great book, different but great."
4,good read,H.R. Haggard does not disappoint in yet another riveting adventure classic. It compares well with his better known Alan Quartermain stories.
4,.,"A rather racist, nineteenth-century Indiana Jones. If you can stand talk of savages and damsel-in-distress sort of attitudes, by all means, pick up this nicely paced adventure tale."
4,Just discovered another Classic,"I just discovered the free books section of Kindle and am enjoying finding ""classics"" like this one. The author was well ahead of his time in anticipating reading tastes and weaves a wonderful story of a quest for the hero."
4,Very Good Read,"The book was very engaging, and I found myself getting excited as the book was reaching the end. I loved the way it ended like a fairy tale with every one happy and content. The only negative was that I did find the story dragging in a few locations. Other than that, this book was just as good as some of his other titles I have read."
4,"Hey, Hey! Can you ever know too much about the Monkees?","Some of the information was old hat, but the time lines and order of events is very interesting. The comprehensive lists and recording information was mind boggling. A true must-have for any die-hard Monkees fan. Onward to the the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame boys!!!"
3,not cherry wood,"THE BOX ITSELF WAS SUPPOSE TO CHERRY AND IT SURELY IS NOT. IT IS BROWNISH WITH BLACK -ALMOST A MARLE LOOK, AND NOT QUITE SURE IF IS REALLY WOOD.THE INSIDE IS NICE!! :)"
3,QUALITY CONTROL ISSUE,"i bought a refurbished krups xp4030 from overstock for $69.99. i thought that the machine will be going through Quality Control for a second time and anything that is wrong with the machine would be corrected. WRONG!!! on cleanup, after using the machine, i pulled out the drip tray and a piece of plastic came loose from the clasp that holds the tray in. looked in manual to see where it belongs.the manual is written on cheap paper,has cheap illustrations, and not so great instructions.the machine makes delicious espresso. i used lavazza, half pound in food emporium about $7. not cheap, but well worth the money.havn't used the steam wand yet, as i like it straight up.great coffee from a machine with a problem. planning to call krups in the morning ."
1,Disappointed in Krups,"Don't get this unit. The steam wand comes off during steaming, the 1st espresso came out good then the next day the unit wouldn't make espresso.Very disappointed in Krups."
1,short lived semi adequate while it works,"An easy to use medium to low quality machine while it lasts. My experience is that it does not come up with enough pressure to make steam but one can get a decent espresso while the seals last. The gasket seals in some production batches will start giving up after 3-6 months of use, depending on usage. The machine will start sputtering steam and water from around the head gasket. If this happens early enough it should be covered by warranty. The problem will likely reappear. The repair will cost more than the $74 that you should be paying for a new Krups. So, one is probably better off buying a new machine.Krups XP4030 Pump Espresso Machine, Black"
5,Can I change my review??,"I have been using this one for years on a daily basis and it's worked extremely well. Some pre-ground espresso beans cause the machine to clog, but I would imagine that would happen with other machines as well. Using the Krups GVX2-12 Burr Grinder it makes a great espresso every time.EDIT: Machine started leaking out of the bottom. It is out of warranty :( I would now recommend the Cusinart machine that comes with a 3 year warranty instead."
5,An Entertaining History of Eighteenth Century England,"This book provides a highly amusing view of eighteenth century England, specifically the period immediately following the Augustan Age, i.e., the decades between the death of Alexander Pope (1744) and the publication of Wordsworth's ""Lyrical Ballads"" (1798). It is both educational and very funny.If you're interested in purchasing a hardback version, consider the beautifully bound one published by the Folio Society in 1993."
3,It could be better,"Well, the cd is all right, but there are a lot of good merengue hip-hop bands better than the ones on this cd. I think the people who did this cd could have done much better. Try Calle Ciega or zona 7. the good songs on this cd are just about the ones from proyecto 1, sandy & papo and fulanito."
1,Very Disappointing,"My girlfriend bought one a couple weeks ago, and it has absolutely NO power. If you put your hand to the opening, you can barely feel any suction at all. I have played around with the filter and the way it fits into the the other piece that actually fits into the vacuum (and messed with how the ""other piece"" fits into the outside case of the vacuum, it's two separate pieces that fit together and connect to the top part of the vacuum) with little success. I have read the other great reviews for it on Amazon, and I'm not sure if I have a lemon or what?!?"
1,Throttle Body Spacer does not work as advertised.,"On the packaging Airaid claims:Improves fuel efficiency up to 4 mpg - my tests showed no improvement in fuel mileage whatsoever;Increases low end torque by 21 ft lbs - absolutely falseImproves throttle response through improved combustion efficiency - my vehicle did not experience any improvementI installed this product as per instructions provided on my 2005 Ford F150, 4.6l gasoline engine and found not noticeable improvement in performance of torque or fuel efficiency. I documented this through 4 tanks of fuel and near identical running conditions over a 4 week period.I had read many conflicting reports about throttle body spacers and have now come to the conclusion as many others have that if it did what they claim then Ford would have included the product as standard equipment given the competitive nature of the automotive industry.Don't waste your time and money. I gave it one star rating only because there was not a zero star option"
3,Not the product pictured!,"According to my order history, this is the cable that I own, however mine has a much larger shield on the 3.5mm jack side than the one pictured.The cable is pretty thick and feels well constructed.HOWEVER, I'm not overwhelmingly happy with the cable for the following reason:Somehow I underestimated the length that I would need and as a result the 12' is cutting it VERY close (I'm hooking my laptop up to my home theatre system). Because I need every centimeter I can get to keep my computer at the optimal location, I need to keep any ounce of stress off of the 3.5mm jack. When there is too much pressure, the audio cuts out. I've never experienced this before. It's pretty frustrating, however as long as I am careful with the cable it works fine.I'm much happier with the shorter cable I bought by Phoenix Gold:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BY844O"
3,not a genuine reissue,"I never heard the song pleasuredome or power or love til this spring. So I decided to get the CD. I was surprised that it had artwork edited. Which is surprising these days. They could have at least gave people more in the booklet since they couldn't release a double CD to include All the songs on the original. If your new to FGTH start here. I also bought Reload,Liverpool, and Holly Johnson's CDs. Love his voice. What's really cool is now you can take those 12inch mixes and chop them up to make your own. I have rearranged Pleasuredome, Power of Love and Wildlife."
5,Cal Smith - The Best,This is a wonderful album. Cal's rich. smooth voice is as good as it ever was. He has been overlooked and under rated for years.
5,I Was Raised on this music,"Music is what draws people in to listin to you. what can you say when you eat,sleep, and breath music your whole life."
1,Do not buy,The bean quality is awful.It the same as a local supermarket which charges 1.7$/lbThe Barry Farm for it's product charges less than 3$/lb.Bad deal.
3,different,Sad to say I started listening to Terry Pratchett with this story MOVING PICTURES. I have 7 more Terry Pratchett audios to listen to that I bought due to the high star ratings of the reviews on Amazon. Very disappointed. I have now reread the reviews and hopefully I will enjoy some of the others. I go through 3 to 4 audios a week. So I will definately listen to them all. The Narrator deserves a 6 star rating he was brilliant!!!!
2,one of the lower-quality discworld books,"the plot is a little bit superficial and has, like the film industry, not really some depth to think about. it's a discworld book with all this nice highlights of writing style but as the main red line is not a very interesting one to me, i find this book one of the lower quality discworld ones... if you are a discworld fan, then it's of course for you, but if you are looking for a first discworld book, then make sure it's not this but instead e.g. Small Gods or Monstrous Regiment or Pyramids"
4,"Great, but far from the best","I've read most of the Diskworld novels and just finished this one. Frankly, I am a little bit disappointed. The biggest disappointment with it is that the characters just lack the liveliness and originality of all other Diskworld books I've read. The only great character this time around is Gaspode The Wounder Dog. Victor and Elaine are just too bland, and don't have anything interesting going on for them (not Rinsewind fear of everything, not Cohen ridiculous selfesteem, nor Vimes cool strong lead.) They just lack any special quality(except Gaspode that is.) It is still really really funny and I've enjoyed it more than most non-Terry Pratchet book I've read but I think it is the weakest one of the diskworld series."
5,Mistake by Amazon,"I have never seen this book before and I don't know why Amazon thinks that I have purchased it. I have purchased other Disc World books and I love them all but I haven't read this one. I probably will though, so get back to me then."
3,Great Music but not a Great Recording (DTS),"I would agree that this is a fine CD because of the great musical content, but I bought it primarily because I have DTS equipment and there are few recordings worth having in DTS format thus far. I am less than pleased with the DTS recording quality, and would recommend the others I own for critical listening before I would this one. The sound is muddy when played at loud volumes, and I have a system that is top-notch!"
1,Does not install on win 98se,"I tried to install this on a win98se system and even though I installed and uninstalled 3 times, I kept getting the message can not initialize, and modules not found each time I started the hunk of junk. The only somewhat uniques thing about my win98 system is the windows directory is windows2. I don't think they tested this very well."
2,Not a romance!,"As a book about interesting people, this book is top notch.But it's been marketed as a romance, which it isn't. The ""romance"" in it is a one night stand followed by years of not communicating, then a note. The ending isn't even very satisfying."
4,Looks great and is a solid pitcher.,"No complaints. It arrived in one piece and is very solid. It is a little smaller than I had pictured, but that is okay. I would like a slightly larger version."
4,For Chaka Khan lovers...,"Hey--I really liked this CD, it gives a good overview of Chaka Khan's music in 16 short tracks. I usually don't buy compilations or ""best ofs"" because they usually don't have all the best hits, but this one does to me! I was a little girl in the 80s, and this CD is reminiscent of all the big hits like ""I Feel For You,"" of course and stuff before that (a little before my time, like her stuff with Rufus) and it just takes you through the whole Chaka era, to her now ""jazzy"" stlye, which also is great and totally her!Good Buy--where's volume 2? :)"
5,The Best of Chaka,"This is one great cd. It's absolutley the best of everything. Her vocal range is amazing and she really shows it off in Night in Tunisia and I Know You, I Live You (love those cuts!). She is wonderful with Bruce Hornsby in Love Me Still (such a romantic song). This is one cd that allows you to enjoy the Chaka we've come to know and love. It's a classic you always want to keep around and that you never grow tired of. Vocally, she's second to none."
4,Worlds Apart CD,I like the music on this cd. Was able to preview some of the songs before buying and they all lived up to my expectations when I listened to the whole song after purchase.
3,lightweight but beware!!,I have these for my cats. They are tolerated well but one cat alsmost was stragulated to death because the adjustable locking/gear mechanism became unlocked when he got spooked causing the neck loop to tighten to the point I had to immediately cut it off!! What I did then was actually superglue the mechanism in place so it cannot ever move. I have now been using them with no problems.
3,kitty harness,"I wanted a good cat harness that I could take my cats out to their screen tent that would be secure enough that they could not get loose and run away, This does work, but it does have a tendency to tighten around the neck, IF YOU DON'T MAKE SURE IT GETS IN THE LOCK POSITION."
5,mine,"this thing is great, easy to use, had to get this because cable company wouldnt let me have another box. but this was easy to set up and use"
2,Dual Tuner Problematic,"Two problems have surfaced using the TIVO unit. The first is the lack of a 5 pin serial port for connection of the tuning cable which causes the use of the funky light attachment at the front of the unit when hooked to a Direct TV box. Sometmes the tuning is inaccurate causing misfires when programs are recorded. The other problem is that internally the TIVO unit looks for a basic cable signal erratically for the second tuner. I have replaced all of the cables with new shielded cables so I know that is not the problem. I am replacing it with a Direct TV DVR. When the TIVO works, it is great, but it is not reliable enough for me."
3,Died after a year and a half,"I love this television...great picture, especially when using the component inputs for video games. However, one afternoon I'm watching television, turn it off to run errands, come back home and turn it on...no response...it's dead. I try other plugs in the house...no avail. And of course, the manufacturer's warranty ran out 6 months earlier...nice timing. Now I have to foot the bill myself to get it repaired. Not willing to spend any more money with Panasonic at this point. Ridiculous."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is completly inaccurate, it may have some novelty value for those wishing a good read but for the dedicated borzoi enthuasiast I wouldn't bother, Lorraine Groshans 'the complete borzoi' would be a better buy."
4,A Kaleidoscope with many facets,"The combination of intelligence with all the other virtues of poetry is what struck me about this collection. These poems can be romantic, insightful, clever, sentimental, penetrating and even sometimes scary - but all done with a quality of care and thoughtfulness that truly impresses. Even the few that I did not particularly enjoy struck me by how well constructed they are. The translations make an effort to accommodate the rhyme scheme of the original. Keep these poems in your daily tote so you can enjoy them when the commute runs long or you are kept waiting for an appointment."
1,not good and broken too!,The first cd was pretty lame hokey late 60s-early 70s country I guess is what you would call it. The second cd would not play. Immediate return on this one. First time I've done that with an Amazon purchase.
5,A Garden for Groundhog,"Just like all of Lorna Balian's books this one is fun to read and enjoyed by my grandchildren. Goes through the year of gardening and also tells about ""Groundhog Day""."
3,Not very palatable,"I am not a trained singer. I am certain the exercises presented are valuable ones. There's certainly good information here. Unfortunately the singer's voice is so sugary and fake sounding that I can't choke this down. I absolutely want to hurl into a bucket every time she sings. How can I take advice from someone who thinks this sounds good? I hate to be so negative about anything that's probably full of good information, but I can't help it. I think this is awful. If the jewel case hadn't broken when I opened the package, I'd try to return the item. This is a lot of money to pay for a thing I hate this much."
5,love the raunchy humor,This show is hilarious and wrong on so many levels :) I know nothing about fantasy football and I find it hilariously awesome! :)
3,ok,"Not as funny as the previous three seasons. There were times I could not breathe I was laughing so hard during the first three seasons. This season I laughed out loud a few times but not as often and not as hard. All shows demise, I guess this is the start."
1,"Lies, all lies!","Reading it, it all seemed really unbelievable, so I did some research on this book, and found out the author made the whole thing up.I didn't finish the book. Wasn't worth my time."
4,Only one of its kind!,"I've had my copy of this second edition for years, and my only complaint is it's not updated often enough. Once a decade is just not cutting it, Dean (the author). Oh wait, my other complaint is the paperback binding is horrible. Seriously, expect pages to come unglued and start falling out within a month of use. The old comb binding of the first edition was truly horrible, so as long as you keep the loose pages on your desk, this second edition problem isn't as bad.But if your job depends on you knowing the difference between ""native"" and ""Native,"" when not to use ""Alaskan,"" or if it's ""sled-dog race"" or ""dog-sled race,"" (and many other state-specific usages) this is the book for you.Four stars due to infrequent updating and lousy binding."
5,inside a fairy's life,a beautiful book. my 3- yo daughter is very interested in fairies and we love looking at the inventive things the fairy has in her house. it is also a beautiful message about taking care of animals and letting the wild ones be wild.
3,For historical interest,"I have to agree with Lady Sekhmet below. This was the second book on anything to do with the occult that I found, and even as a teenager I was able to recognize that some of it wasn't for me, but enough was to make me keep looking."
1,No Powerful Magicks,"This book contains no spells of mass mass destruction, and rather has weak minded spells of hell. Magic was given to man by the Pure and Only GOD. Those who so choose to use Shai'tans version of ""magic"" should know that Pure magic is extremely powerful. Those who wander the dark side shall be destroyed at midnight on December 31st, 1999-2000."
5,Wicca is not Witchcraft!!!!!,"I see a lot of people getting mad that this excellant book does not promote the morals of Wicca...the reason: Witchcraft is not Wicca! Wicca was invented FROM Witchcraft by the late Gerald Gardner. Every Gardnarian knows this and laughs at these modern new-age ""Witches"" with thier crystal spells, and funny dress styles, etc.etc.etc Lighten up! Witchcraft has been around a lot longer than you realize...and it ain't going away!"
4,Great Book,"""Mastering Witchcraft"" is one of the comparatively few books out there that deals with witchcraft without being explicitly Wiccan (this is probably due to the fact that this book was published before Wicca became a fad). Still, it is based partly on Wiccan practice--Huson cites Gerald Gardner and Doreen Valiente (the first known Wiccans) among his sources. The book is well-researched, drawing from Wicca, medieval magical practices, and mythology. Ethical debates aside, the magical theory is sound (for example, reciting the lord's prayer backwards helps the deep mind to shed any remaining religious and moral codes that might prevent the witch from getting 100% involved in the practice of magic). If you just ignore the history in the introduction, and make note of the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of the spells instead of just the spells themselves, I think you'll find this book incredible useful and valuable. I know I have."
4,A classic of the Pagan revival,"Many people won't recall that the publication of this book in 1971 was one of the major influences on the Witchcraft - and Wiccan - movement in America. In many ways it was the 'Spiral Dance' of the 70s, allowing dozens of new covens to form. The author has an excellent feel for the medieval archetype of witchcraft - he takes bits of lore and turns them into workable rituals, including coven rites. He gives detailed instructions for curses and love-bindings, but gives pretty explicit warnings about them too. His work with spirits is pretty cool, though pretty ceremonial magic-y. His chapter on coven organizing was the best thing in print for many years.Recommended, with a grain of salt.Ian Corrigan"
5,THE BEST BOOK OUT THERE,"This book is the one of best books ever written on the subject of Traditional Witchcraft. It is clear and concise and includes many things other books wouldn't dare touch on. If you are sick of fluffy-bunny Wicca garbage, pick up this book and you will be satisfied. This book along with ""Call of the Horned Piper"" by Nigel Aldcroft Jackson are what I recommend to students of REAL Witchcraft. Llewellen eats dirt."
2,a little snug,Purchased CuttleDuds. Good price although they were much smaller than the same size purchased through a department store.
4,Previously This Other Eden,"Gaskin previously write this 30 years before under the title This Other Eden, she has referred to 'This Other Eden' as the Skeleton of this book.Ive noticed that in the first books that Gaskin wrote the characters were not always very likable, in her later books shes developed the characters more and in this book she's went into far more detail than she did previously with 'This other Eden'.This story starts out where we meet Russian Anna and her daughter Nicole living in America. Anna wants everything she never had for her daughter and Nicole does everything she can to make Anna proud of her. When Nicole's English grandfather die's his will changes Anna and Nicole's live for ever.The story goes through Nicole's whole life and how she survived during world war 2. I enjoyed this."
2,Warm But Feel Cheap,When i first put these on they felt nice and warm but a little thin. I put them on anyways and began wearing them only to have a hole in one of the socks within 20 minutes of use. I bought two pairs and will be seeing if the other pair also has this issue but i was a little disappointing in it giving out so quickly.
5,glass candy,"you could have been a bit more creative in stead of putting only the same type in each box. maybe design some other looking candy. other than that, it was packaged well and arrived in a good amount of time. thanks."
3,Don't use for credit cards,For the money it is okay. Three position switch a bit difficult to operate. It is inoperable now as the shredding wheels on one side are jammed with paper and plastic which have bent them destroying the machines ability to shred.
3,Mysterious,This is a book full of secrets dreams and visions.The secret I can't uncover is: What is the meaning of the last line in the last paragraph?Please enlighten.
3,Not as hot as we are led to believe,"Actually rather a pedestrian book about rather a difficult subject .... given the subject matter one would expect to feel more moved, but somewhow Faulks missed it.... The low spots are very low,prepare to weep as Andre and Jacob are led to the gas chamber... but the rest is samey... sorry Sebastian, I am very disappointed"
2,"After the intensity of Birdsong, flat and disappointing.","Despite the no doubt accurate descriptions of wartime covert operations behind enemy lines, and the deprivations and humiliations of life in Vichy France, these are the best parts of the book. Charlotte Gray herself is not a particularly interesting character and her love affair with a RAF pilot somewhat Mills & Boonish. I found her travels through occupied France rather unlikely. Not really in the same class as Birdsong."
1,disappointing:signs of hasty & sloppy plotting,"Was Faulks being pushed by his publisher to produce the book in time for XMAS 1998? Not one character lived on the page, not even the main protagonists. An episode that would have occupied a chapter in BIRDSONG is covered by one paragraph of reported action in the pluperfect tense. The events described in the book are improbable in the extreme. I would not have employed Charlotte Gray if I had been her spymaster."
3,"Faulks' writing is great, but the story is dull.","I was amazed by Faulks' writing style, very poetic and well-written. However, the story itself is boring. It is definitely not a page-turner. I struggled to finish reading the book since it's a gift. This novel is something that can kill the time, but I would not highly recommend it to anyone."
4,And the eyes have it !,"I just recieved this DVD and the sound quality is excellent !!I was frustrated on trying to find the ""hidden"" video's until I got online and found out. Why make it a game??? I just want to watch RUSH!!! They do not share anywhere on the cover or the disk on how to get to them. That's the only reason for the 1 dropped star. I enjoyed the extra selections, but would have prefered some live footage instead of ""made for Mtv"" clips.I hope all of RUSH's previous vhs releases soon get ported to DVD also."
5,Many a moons have passed..........,"I wait in anticipation for this one. As a fan of many years, I must admit that this is too little too late, for the award. I give it a 10 out of a possible 5 star rating. ANY Rush fan knows what should become of this. I just wait for more DVDs from them in the near future."
4,a very good album,"this is a very good album, but what ever happened to the album ""u""? i have that on record, it appears that it was never realeased on CD, which sux very much. but still, this is a very good album and i definately recommend it(though i must admit i can't stand his voice)"
3,So so product,"Likely if your looking at this review then you are hard pressed to find many headsets for your samsung model. If you have to get one then go ahead and buy this, but I'm warning you now its cheap. The cord has the smallest gage of any I've seen before. So thin that the shirt clip it comes with just slides freely on the cord. Also the ear clip feels very loose when wearing it. One good thing is that since the manufactuer cut so many corners making it, it is quite light and you may forget that your ever wearing it."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I have not been a supporter of Nader but was interested to read his opinions and proposed solutions on the problems of the day. Unfortunately this book is a 272 page stream of consciousness rant that offers lots of complaints but very few solutions. The few solutions offered are not even well thought through (For example, ban advertising of unhealthy food to kids. Why is this a government responsibility? Is there any evidence it would it solve the obesity problem? Exactly how would you do this? Any constitutional issues?) This book is an extremely light weight effort and very disappointing. Nader should be ashamed to accept money for this empty diatribe. If you're looking for an alternative for the major parties don't stop here."
1,Nader continues his descent into the abyss,"I've always admired Ralph Nader, but in recent months I can't help but think something is deeply, truly wrong. Attacking Moore, the Greens, the CBC... who's left? Who is he still friends with?He knows this is probably the last time he'll be running, and I suppose wants to go out in a blaze of incoherence.Enter this book, a strange tabletop game far removed from reality, a plan for action in the Bizzaro World that exists only in Nader's fevered brain.I hope someone close to him ends up writing a book about his strange slide into irrelevancy, it would make for more interesting reading and possibly serve as a warning."
1,Thousands Dead in Iraq -- Meet An Acomplice,"Nader is nothing more than a sanctimonious accomplice fore everything that has happened over the past five years. The blood of nearly 2,500 American soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians is on his hands. This cannot be ignored when discussing this book. A book that will get absolutely no attention from the goons he actively helped put in the White House."
4,PLEASANT AND ENTERTAINING,"MIDNIGHT PLEASURES is a good read, nothing extraordinary. I loved both Sophia and Patrick, but the author gave them issues which had inconsistencies in both action and thought, forcing many of their actions to appear unbelievable.Good array of supporting characters.Don't know how the title played into the story. It led the reader to believe there would be more eroticism.I would recommend this book to others, but would let them know that while it's good, it's not really memorable."
3,What's with these Foakes brothers?,"I'm not sure why Eloisa James wanted to make Patrick and Alexander Foakes so unkind.And what's with Pippa? This little girl wasn't even 3 years old and she talked like a grown-up. Her dialogue was just too unbelievable for one so young. Pippa's sitting in with two grown women, carrying on a conversation as if she's one of them, and if you didn't know Pippa was a child, you would think she was one of the women. Case in point being when Sophie's in Charlotte's bedchamber and Pippa joins them. Read the scene and you'll know what I'm talking about."
2,Hmmm...not great or good,This was a disappointing read. ...It started with a lot of potential and then I just started getting extremely irritated with the Herione. Nobody is that irritatingly THAT STUPID! It was even fictionally unbelievable. I did not finish the book because I could not tolerate the relationship between the Hero and Herione after they were married. It did not keep my attention at all. It got extremely boring.
2,Uncomfortable,"In its bag, this chair is very small (about nine inches long and about five inches in diameter). You can set it up in seconds. I think it is rated for 300 lbs. I can confirm that it supported 240. The seat is shaped like a triangle (like a bicycle seat). However, unlike a bicycle seat, this seat is concave. So, if you happen to be a male, you are going to experience some squeezing in a delicate frontal area. I tried it out on my garage floor. The chair's feet are very small and pointy: I fear they would sink like arrows in the soft dirt of a campsite or sports field. But I didn't test that, as I want it to be clean when I try to resell it (due to its uncomfortableness)."
1,A Little Better than Sitting on the Ground,Don't waste your money on this one. The tripod design hurts men. Buy a lighter Coleman 4 legged stool.
5,Fits my body chemistry,"I love this scent, Ralph Lauren's Pure Turquoise! The scent isnt too strong, isnt too weak, and isnt too much like a little girl. Its a scent for a woman and it lasts all day long for me! I cant put it on in the afternoon before work, go home and its still there when I get home to relax from a long day at work."
2,"Okay XP Book, but is redundant and overpriced.","If you are interesting in Extreme Programming or need to evaluate it, I recommend this book with reservations. It is a very readable book but does have some drawbacks:1. It is way overpriced. Too thin, not enough info for [price], even if Amazon discounts it. Ideas are repeated over and over again.2. These authors (and others who review their buddies' books on Amazon and give biased reviews) are making a living off you buying into XP. It is funny how they say the last thing you want to do is adopt XP only partially.3. So don't waste your money on more than one book from this group of XP diciples who are rehashing the same info over and over in about a dozen different books.4. You can adopt only some of the principles provided in XP without adopting the whole practice. I've seen it done successfully in many places. These principles existed before XP and they can exist without it."
4,a call girl watching a vintage movie about a call girl:),"As a call girl, I just had to watch this out of curiosity. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and watching the beautiful Ms. Taylor. The story was sad, with her constantly feeling ashamed of herself and dating a married man who was immoral, yet was judging her and was abusive, sexist and domineering. The ending was sad as well. She should have never taken him seriously. All in all, a good film and it makes me grateful that attitudes towards call girls have relaxed, and will be even more liberal in the future."
5,The Queen of R&B Of hip hop (Aaliyah),I think it is good to have stuff about Aaliyah. At long that it is good stuff not bad stuff. Because I will be glade to read good stuff about her. I want to let Aaliyah Know that I love her and I know that other people love her to. I mess you Aaliyah. My love goes out to her family. Keep you heade up. MUCH LOVE. From Jasmine.W.
2,Aaliyah : More Than a Woman,I was disapointed with this book the author gets off topic exsesivly i wouldnt reconmend this book it would be a wiser choice to go with Aaliyah: An R&B Princess in Words and Picturesor Aaliyah by Tim Footman
3,works or not,"clean brushes just fine plane jane type no hype just dose the job before i was born ....fine brand also, s corp"
4,Navigation Rules,We ordered Navigation Rules for our brother and it was sent within a few days and was in excellent condition. He is a first time boat owner.
3,Great Product-Small Quantities,"When they say ""getting started"", they really mean it. You only get enough dusting powder for one use and the lotion, oil and shampoo/wash only lasted me about three weeks. The products are great but if I had known that the amount of product was so small, I would have just ordered each product individually."
5,Burt's Bees is da BOMB!,"Just love Burt's Bees! Pretty much all their stuff rocks, so ya can't go wrong with it. This was a good price for it, too."
2,There has to be a better option,"I have this stroller also. It is huge even when folded (although it is a snap to fold). It takes up the entire back of my minivan. I don't think the designers ever actually strapped real children into this stroller. The straps have never fit around my oloder child (he is very tall, but it wouldn't even strap on when he was 2) and my younger child, who is very average size, could only be strapped in until he was about 14 months old. Also, by the time they are old enough to need a footrest, it is too short. The holder pouch is very big, but difficult to get anything into, and the handlebars are too wide to slip diaper bag straps around. I often end up putting it on top of the sun shade, which is too low to be useful to the kids. It rubs accross their heads and drives them nuts. Bottom line, strap your kids in (if you can) and take it for a ride around the store before buying."
5,Great DVD!,I love watching Red and the whole Possum Lodge gang. Great delivery and product. Will buy again. A lot of entertainment value for the dollar.
5,Foreman G5 Grill,This product works very well. It has already been used numerous times. The waffle plates are great. There is no sticking at all.
3,Not as great as you think it will be,"Maybe I'll just never be a big fan of George Foreman grills, but I've found that I've only used this thing a couple of times since laying down some fairly serious cash to get it. I don't eat eggs, so the omelet plate was of no use. Grilling takes far, far longer than you are led to believe in the instructions (absolutely no time savings over a regular grill). I didn't see any great amounts of fat being cooked and drained off foods. I ended up giving it to a family member and kept using another electric grill I already had."
4,GF GRP90WGP G5,"I bought this as a Xmas gift for my Mom !! So far, she has used it only twice, But she told me she is very Pleased !! And I got the best price I've seen anywhere !!"
3,Better for fabricaholics,"This is a good book, with wonderful information, but it makes the assumption that the reader has a large fabric stash. For beginning quilters, who don't have a pool of fabric on hand to draw from, another book on color may be better. The author has the reader pull fabric from their stash and put small pieces on worksheets. She does give you some tips that can be used without going through the exercises, but to get the full benefit of this book, you really need a stash of fabric."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"Most of it is in Black and WHite. It does not show all fashions, the fashions that it does how are most of the times not complete.DON'T buy it!Get better Sarah Sink eames volumes and The Ultimate Barbie Book"
5,Seeing how God works,"Echoes of MercyThe author was employed in a juvenile reform institution. She recognized that few of the girls went on to ""reform""their lives. She documents the direction she followed to create a highly successful new organization that is now international in scope and istransforming, rather than just reforming, young women's lives. Her book is well written and the results of her program, Mercy Ministries, are remarkable.Highly recommended reading particularly if you know someone with a daughter on the wrong path."
2,"Don't bother if you have the 100 ""greatest"" fights","Good fights... but It's skimpy, same as the regular dvd version, no bonus fights like the later blu-ray releases.Also you can get all of these fights on the 100 greatest fights collection.The 10 bonus ko's and subs are not complete fights and can also be found elsewhere.The behind the scenes was a fart in the wind."
1,Bad carburator,I purchased this unit brand new. It would not start. I took it to a Husqvarna dealership and they stated it had bad gas and Husqvarna would not cover this under warrnaty. I told them I put brand new gas in it and they stated that Husqvarna puts gas in them to test and they obviously had bad gas or left it stored outside and casued varnish. Beware of Husqvarna products.
3,HUH?,"I was so pumped to get this from Netflix last night. I got home from work and popped this baby in. I was reading how the opening death scene was gory as hell. All I have to say to that is...do you know what gore is? That wasn't gory. A bunch of cut-a-way shots while blood flies around and showing bodies afterwards is not gory. After that the movie screetches to a halt for around 50 minutes. A couple creepy scenes fill in the really slow times. A love story that makes absolutely no sense is introduced, and some brother hate???? The movie has two or three very creepy scenes that involve the cover creature. Other than that they only thing that saved this movie from being a failure was the very original ending. Not worth buying, but maybe a rental."
5,Just more Krofft Craziness at its best,"I remember seeing Lost Saucer on one of the Saturday morning preview shows that used to come on the Friday night at the start of the new season. For some reason, seeing the previews for this show really captivated my 9 year old mind. Like all of the Krofft shows, they are somewhat (cheezy, zany, campy), but as Krofft fans we love them. Ruth Buzzi and Jim Neighbors play androids Fi and Fum who pick up a kid and his baby sitter and take off in their flying saucer, and cant find their way back to earth to take them home. Like I said, more Krofft craziness, but you gotta love it. 5 stars for being Krofft, and also for the nostalgic rush. I just wish Krofft was still on tv today on Saturday mornings...."
2,Don't do this one up close.,"This is really only a good trick if you're going to be pretty far away from your audience. Too close and it's very easy to see the breaks in the wand.Also, this is a very hard trick for young kids to perform themselves."
5,A great devotion even for the non-gardener.,"I first received Garden Psalms as a gift -- not being a gardener, I was somewhat mystified at why it had been chosen. But once I began to read and use the devotions, I knew. So many of us are frustrated by being so ""city busy"" that we never see, much less appreciate, the natural world around us. Garden Psalms let me have a time each day when I could smell a sprawl of honeysuckle or imagine a ladybug going to work in a backyard garden. I have since given to it friends who are passionate gardeners and those those can't tell a rose from a tulip; to friends who both religious and non-religious -- everyone has remarked on the great sense of peace this book brings them."
1,No Light to the Saber,"My son wanted to be a Jedi Knight for Halloween, so I purchased this light saber. We had a multi-colored toy just like it from Disney that lit up, so I thought this one would too. Unfortunately it did not and this caused a problem. My five year old was quite upset that there was no ""Light"" to his ""Light Saber"".It's not a bad concept, but it's a cheap toy not worth it's price."
1,Don't waste your money on this CD!,"Unlike most K-Tel CD's which are compilations of original artists singing their original songs, this CD is none of that. ""Stock Car Smashes"" has 14 familiar titles. However, what you are getting is 14 songs sung by a dreadful band by the name of The Magnificent Tracers (one is by The Obscure). I assure you there is NOTHING magnificent about them. This horrible bar/cover band is only overshadowed by the music's deplorable production. If they were playing this music in a bar, no one would be listening. Trust me when I say it is better to have a nickel in your pocket than waste it on this CD. I am only sorry that I had to give it one star. It deserves NONE!"
4,Worked for My Husband,"I got the original edition of this book after my husband's heart attack and bypass more than 10 years ago, in order try to keep his cholesterol at reduced level. He didn't use the niacin, but I have been making oat bran muffins for him regularly since his surgery, and we've both been using the phytosterol tablets Kowalski recommends for some time. I can say that for my husband, at least, it works and he's been able to eat pretty normally and still keep his cholesterol level down to the satisfaction of his doctor."
4,Space Rock: new & improved!,"Solo album number two for this French guitarist, which I rate higher than his first offering the year before in 1978. The sax and ""art rock"" sensibilities are still here as before, but this just sounds a lot more ""spacier"" & focused to my ears. Christian's guitar playing and the overall tone of the album should have no problem satisfying your Space Rock cravings,if that is what you're after. Lots and lots of keyboards & synth, along with that aforementioned guitar tone,make this a worthy addition to that now somewhat archaic genre.For the curious or newcomer I would recommend this release, over his first album, without reservation. Listening to it now, as I write this review, it holds up rather well - ""archaic"" or not, I still enjoy it!"
2,Low quality camping stove,"The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired.Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety."
3,"Cute, light fiction",This is a very fast fluffy read which I picked up because I live in Dupont Circle. It is perfectly entertaining - and may be a good beach choice - a romance between a judge and a student and the story of the judge's gay son and partner.
4,Lively Busby Berkeley musical is pre-code delight,"Did I say pre-code. You bet. How else would you describe the opening musical number set in a girls' dormitory with the chorus line in various stages of dress! This film delivers. It's funny, tuneful, sexy and fast paced. Our hero, Eddie Cantor, is thrown out of school for hiding in the girls dorm. He gets taken for a ride by bank robbers to Mexico where his old pal, played by Robert Young, passes him off as a famous bull figher. The fun begins with Eddie dodging detectives, girls' fathers and an expectant crowd of bull fight fans. Berkeley works his magic with the musical numbers which makes this film a visual and audio delight. Plenty of pretty girls and good songs. Highly recommended for Berkeley fans, pre-code fans, and anybody looking for some light-hearted fun."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I always wondered how people could take a fiction book and make a religion out of it and after reading this, I still don't get it. Anyone who looks at this book as anything other than fiction deserves their life ruined by these cult weirdos. Even with an open mind, this book is laughably bad.Total Literary Garbage. It's joining the kindling in my fireplace this winter."
5,"The mechanics of the Mind, discovered and codified.",I enjoyed this book. I've used its procedures and found them remarkably effective. I recommend this text for someone wishing to improve and get more in touch with their 'inner self'.Remarkable!
2,"Interesting, but overall not worth the time","There's a bit of controversy over Hubbard's views. I've heard a lot of things secondhand, but I wanted to make my mind up for myself. The book is fairly interesting, but his writing style really lacks the structure and clarity you'd want in a book that often times is very technical. He rambles on a bit too much in places as well. If you have a lot of free time and you want to read some decent science fiction, this might be a good book for you. If you're looking for something a bit more serious and credible, I'd keep looking."
1,Book was to old and printing difficult to read,"I was a bit disappointed in this book.Perhaps if there was more information about the condition, age and print size, it would have been helpful. Pages were yellowed. The book is small and bulky. I will be ordering another one because this one is not comfortable for me to read.It just so happened that my brother ordered the Dianetics book and his was practically new, large print and with pictures.His cost was less than mine.I was disappointed but not discouraged.The order was timely and packaged very well"
1,The cure for everything?,"From what I read. This book says the mind causes all illness. When that doesn't work there is a book called clear body. When that doesn't work there is operating thetan. Which you try after new era dianetics doesn't work. Each claims to rid you of illness. By the mind you are told, by toxins, by aliens, by past lives, a new excuse around every turn/book. Body thetans. Google that ."
5,emancipation from mental slavery,"None but ourself can free our minds. So much for ""talking"" and ""telling"" what it should be. Here is the tool to do the job !! I took this book and used it and my mind has never been healthier. I also applied the technique to my friends and family with remarkable success. It is so amazing and powerful, yet very easy to apply. I wish everyone could get their hands on it."
1,Rambling and incomprehensible,This book is terribly difficult to read and is full of a quack science assertions with no support and little explanation.
1,Low quality overall,Writing style was extremely predictable and poor. Didn't see what the fuss is about. L ron is a science fiction writer...
1,"Things That Make You Go ""Hmmmmm.....""","I read constantly, and love books that make me think. Even books that support theories I disagree with, I'll still give a good reading, with an open mind.However, this book was truly, literally junk.Most books that I don't like I wind up giving to Goodwill, but after I read this book, I felt that donating it (and thus, foisting it upon an unsuspecting stranger) would be a grave disservice to my fellow man.This is the one and only book I've ever thrown in the trash, because I truly felt that's where it belonged.Complete garbage."
2,You get what you pay for,"I am not sure what the other people were thinking, but if you are looking for something nice to compliment your ipaq, look elsewhere. The construction was shoddy, it arrived scrathed. It has some cheap coating on the aluminum that makes it look like a little girls cheap toy. It did not fit in the cradle for my ipaq 3835. If you think you can save a few bucks and get this model be aware you will not get the best quality."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. Instructions that came with product are confusing and unclear. Took a long time to find buttons on screen mentioned in instructions. Important things like the menu button hard to find, and although have had product for a few weeks still haven't found menu button on some screens. Lighting is very poor very hard to read screens output. Letters are large enough for the most part but lighting to poor to read.Functionality is fine if you can see results. Overall, expected a little better product.Synchronizing only works with Outlook not with outlook express.I am still considering returning."
4,good value,"Just purchased this handy little item as I wanted to test the PDA waters before jumping in on a more expensive model. It works great for what I use it for, phonebook, scheduling, notes, etc... Would be nice if you didn't have to scroll to see entire address lines and if it had a search mode for the scheduler, but very good value overall. If you don't need email, video, phone, etc., then this is definitely worth checking out. Touchpad screen is remarkably accurate and easy to use."
5,"Not Exactly right, but pretty close","This is not an exact replica of the games. A disapointment, when you consider that namco has the rights to the ""roms."" The galaga game has the sound effects messed up on the challenge stages, which doesn't affect playability.The real irritation, however, is the Dig Dug game. They programmed it in a way that it doesn't fit on the TV screen. That's right, it has one of those annoying scrolling screens. It's unplayable for someone like me that played the real arcade game.The pac-man games are perfect replicas, however, the original pac-man screen on my TV was very difficult to see. The weakness of the little nintendo joystick is painfully apparent here. The difficulty of a game should be it's premise, not poor controls.But this game is fun, if for no other reason than to use your nintendo and play the games on your TV."
3,Nice little lantern....,"This is a nice little lantern, but there were a couple of issues. First,the knob is very hard to turn and second, the top plate seems a little flimsy. Other than that, the self ignition button worked fine and it gives out good light for a small lantern."
4,Paper jam . . .,"Yep, I had the same problem with the error message that there was a paper jam. There was NO paper jam. It stopped feeding paper so we just bought another one. Can't for the life of me figure out what the problem is. Not worth trying to get repaired since it will probably cost $50 just for someone to look at it!"
4,PixmaiP1500 Photo Printer,"I bought the printer as an economical choice, good quality and inexpensive ink, especially from competitors. The ink is what costs. Like gas prices, I need to watch the costs. I believe this model is being discontinued. I have three. Always good to have backups. Two are used in business, one for my daughter in College."
4,A Very Decent Printer For The Price!,"I got this printer as part of a bundle with a new computer. I was using an Epson at the time and the cost of ink cartridges was driving me up the wall! One day, the Epson died a terrible death and I pulled the Canon Pixma iP500 out of the closet, plugged it in, the computer recognized it immediately and it's been printing happily ever since.This is a very decent printer for around $50.00. I've not printed any photos with it. But for plain paper printing of documents, it works just fine in a home office or for a student. And others here have printed photos and say they look great.So the long and short of it is if you just need a basic printer that will print out fine looking plain paper documents and apparently does a decent job of photos too, consider the Canon Pixma iP1500."
4,Good starting photo printer.,"The Canon PIXMA ip1500 is a good starting photo printer for its price range. It has a very stylish design, and it does not clutter your desktop.The quality of the prints it produces are exceptional for the price. And the ink cartriges are insanely inexpensive, compared to my mother's Epson and Lexmark printers.There is a minor delay from when you tell the printer to print, and when it actually does print (during which it is a bit noisy). Still, this is not a major problem.My only criticism is that I wish it had a paper tray for the printed paper. It does not have any, and this means there is nowhere for the paper that has been printed on to go, except your desktop. But still, this is a wonderful printer for a very inexpensive price, and the low cost of the ink makes it even more worth it."
5,great product,"Exactly what I was looking for because I have a stackup on ink. I was happy to find this product, when i was striking out at the stores. I did not know it was an obsolete product. Thanks"
3,Actually 3.5 stars is what I'd give this product ...,I give this product a medium to low rating bcuz Spanish just like any other language has many different dialecs and some words I tried translating into Spanish to English weren't recognized. For example .. Por Favor or Comida were unrecognizable. Also every time I write a capital I it keeps being recognized as a V no matter how matter times I write it. Is there something wrong with my Fly Pen ? Either way the translations aren't quite accurate bcuz my friend who speaks fluent spanish says that some of the translations are old spanish translations that people don't even use anymore. Like Amora is Love or Amor. Some still use it but most hispanics nowadays use AMO and words like I couldn't be translated. It's better just to buy a English-Spanish pocket translator.
4,"A hell of a punch, but questionable aim","WFO starts off with ""Where it Hurts"". That's what Bobby and the crew are best at--hitting where it hurts. Overkill has been a long-faithful band that never succumbed to the temptation to go mainstream. On this record, they show that they are just as capable of anger, hostility, and brutality as they ever were. Though they've learned some new tricks over the years, they are the still the same carniverous animale they ever were. I think that, after the impressive first cut, they wander a bit through the first half of the CD, but from ""Under One"" on, this disk KILLS. ""Gasoline Dream"" is one of my all time favorites. Oh, wait, so is ""Bastard Nation"". The acoustic segment is a nice rest for the ears, which take a heck of a pounding from the bass-laden, drum-heavy mix. If you're a fan of classic thrash, or have liked Overkill in the past, go for this one. Excellent in the car, or when someone's ticked you off and you want to smash their face in. Cheers, Overkill."
2,Disappointing,"The show is great, but some episodes were edited, especially ""Quadromania"", one of the very best episodes of the series, with an amazing Richard Lynch killing cab drivers.Disappointing. :("
3,A disappointing season,"This season is unfortunately full of lacklustre episodes. Beginning with the awful ""Murder on Voodoo Island"", which should give you an idea of the ride you are in for. Granted, there are one or two OK episodes (Fatal Charm for example), but overall, this box-set is not worth purchasing. Season 4 was released in Australia at beginning of December 2005, let's hope it is a bit better (I'll rent that one first)."
4,"""They"" are great - the dvd's disappoint","I have loved Starsky & Hutch since I was 11! I was so thrilled to find them released on DVD. Some of the episodes are hokey but most are wonderful. Any chance to watch these guys in action should be taken. I was, however, very disappointed with the quality of the dvd production. some scenes were deleted all together from the shows. Quadromania comes to mind as well as Trapped which had obvious deletes. I'm sure there are more that I can't remember - it's been 30 years. It would have been nice to seem some reunion interviews, bloopers and making of's on the DVD as well. With the footage that we all know is out there and the technology we have - this stuff could have easily been added to the DVDs. Let's get it together Sony - the fans want the whole show if nothing else . Season 4's a comin' - get it right this time!"
5,Simply one of the best albums of all time.,"I bought this album after seeing the movie ""Down By Law."" I can't believe this could be as well kept a secret as it is. This is simply one of the finest pieces of music I've ever heard. One surprise after another, representing a lifetime of originality for most musicians. ""Blind Love"" is almost physically painful to hear."
4,Fantastic Cd by a Fantastic Artist,"Tom Waits is truly the great american songwriter. And this album is nearly a masterpiece. I prefer some of his earlier work, but nevertheless this one is awsome. I also sugest checking out a young artist by the name of Jackie Greene, who is also a very talented songwriter."
5,The Dirty from Texas,"The Boss Hog Outlawz just dropped a JEWEL! This album comes out the gate hard. I was a little skeptical at first b/c a lot of times, when a good rapper comes out with his boys on a cd, it's rarely very good. This is not the case with Serve & Collect. All the beats are great and each rapper can hold his own. In fact, as much as I love Already Platinum from Slim Thug, this album just might be better. This is definitely the first album to drop in 07 with straight fire! The BH Outlawz have set the bar high for everyone else who's coming out with an album this year. 5 STARS"
5,"Wonderful, of course","Picking a favorite Nick Drake album is purely a matter of personal taste, as all his songs range from good to fantastic, but my favorite is this one, a bridge between the romantic genius of Five Leaves Left and the starkness of Pink Moon. Nick makes the most use of instrumentation here, using horns and strings to excellent effect on ""Hazey Jane II"" and ""At the Chime of a City Clock"" and recording three tracks with no vocals at all. There are no weak moments here, but the song I like best would have to be ""Northern Sky"", a wonderful composition that embodies everything wonderful about music and is one of the few true love songs Drake ever wrote."
5,though not his best; certainly priceless and necessary,"I own the Nick Drake Trilogy; and this is not as good as Pink Flamingo. this is in my own opinion and someone else, may like this one more than the others. The three cd's are necessary for all acoustic guitar players and afficionado's, even if you're not. Stylistically, Drake is a revolutionary and no one can touch him. Sure, this album does sound a bit heavy, but as far as I'm concerned, Drake's creativity and sheer brilliance overshadow this minor predicament. Well worth the pitifully low price of this cd."
2,Misleading Title,"Do not buy this if you are planning to climb Mount Whitney via the Whitney portal above Lone Pine, CA. This map covers almost all of the sierra and is useless unless you are going to hike the entire John Muir trail."
1,Avoid the General-Books.net edition,"I didn't realize I was getting an edition which had been scanned by a robot and interpreted with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. It is full of typos, and entire paragraphs are misplaced. There's no reason to buy the messy General Books edition when there is a clear reproduction currently in print by Bison Books. At least, I hope that will be the right one when I reorder it!"
2,A bit dissappointing....,"I have a group of friends that play trivial pursuit fairly often and we were excited that this new 90's game was out. While I've enjoyed all the editions I was dissappointed in this game overall. It only came with one pack of cards and several plastic dispensers so you could divide the cards by year. The idea is that you roll a 10 sided die to select the year your queston will relate to. We have played this game only four times with between two and four people and we have already run through all the cards and are getting repeat questions. I definitely wish it came with more cards, or at least the option to buy supplemental cards. Another thing...in the older editions if you got a question that you didn't know the answer to right off many times you could at least come to a pretty good ""guess"" by deductive reasoning. In this game you either know the answer or you don't."
2,Not my idea of fun!,"The game was not at all what I expected. As the previous reviewers stated the game only has four playing pieces. Why would they mess with a good thing? Six pieces was the perfect amount. The questions were a little easy, and a bit boring. On top of only having four playing pieces the one I got came with a duplicate piece, so I only had three different pieces. I was highly disappointed."
5,prompt shipping,This order was received very promptly. I am pleased with the quick receipt of my order.
4,Trivial Pursuit 90's edition,"So much fun! The questions are hard, but not impossible. It wouldn't be fun if we knew all the answers. The only complaint I have is that we went through the cards fairly quickly, but it hasn't been that big an issue."
3,Hot n' Deadly assasin...yes please!,"This is yet another female revenge flick with a little twist, I wont give that away. All of the money in this flick was spent on the cast..and with the likes of Tom Berrenger, Michael Biehn, James Russo ( who I phkin' love and is great in this), William Forsythe, Tom Sizemore..and more...they all play their parts to a tee and make what could have been a very formulaic b flick into tons of fun. This one is not really an original in any way...but it is entertaining, and the players all give top notch performances save for Paul Sloan who is the weakest link in the cast. If you are looking for anything ground breaking..you won't find it here, but what you will find is a cool little indie, with great characters that will take the viewer on a fun little ride..if you let it."
3,A Different Side of Stana,"I purchased this film specifically to watch the performance of Stana Katic (Castle), and she did not disappoint. The film was not a style I would normally watch, but for those who don't mind a bit of blood shed then this a good film."
2,"Amazing cast, but too much gratuitous gore","I too bought this since admiring the work of Stana Katic in TV's sophomore season of ""Castle."" I find her a great foil to Nathan Fillion's Rick Castle character and the camera does a lot of facial close up work highlighting her terrific expressions. In ""Stiletto"" there is much to like with a huge character cast of accomplished actors and Stana as the stunning protagonist. My reservation was the almost silly gore accompanying the violence. In my opinion I think this reduced the effectiveness of the script and acting as well as the market. Given the ranking of lower than 23,000, I'm guessing this is not one of the producer's finest moments...it could have been a wonderful opportunity to weave a complex story with great acting, but isn't. Enjoy Stana's on-screen moments, and fast-forward the rest. By the way, on a recent late-night talk show she pronounced her name STAH-nah KAH-tick."
3,Reminiscent of Madeline L'Engle,"Excellent writing reminiscent of Madeline L'Engle, but not in the same league as A Wrinkle in Time. This book would be better for older ages as some of the language is a bit abstract. I wished the area of Lightland was more substantial as there doesn't seem to be a lot going on there. Not a thrilling journey, but still pretty good writing."
4,Kris is a major talent,"Saw Kris a few times in concert last year and he sang a lot of the songs on this CD. I didn't give him 4 stars because Kris really is not the best singer, but, boy, these are the best songs!"
5,With age comes wisdom,"Kristofferson has reached the pinnacle with this CD! A songwriting master and this work is a continuation of a long career of speaking to the soul. He is pure evidence of how those who have followed have somehow missed the point; and you can bet Kris will probably get very little airtime on today's ""country"" music radio stations. They like flash but have no appreciation for true works of art. I have just about worn out the CD listening to it over and over. Free Leonard Peltier!"
5,Love It,"This CD is a shinning example of why Kristofferson is one of the best songwriters this country has ever produced. Not only amazing lyrics, but a great ability to marry lyrics and music to tell some profound American stories. There's not a wasted note or phrase in these songs. The production on this CD is AMAZING. Yes, the sessions are rough around the edges, but the sound quality, and tone is so stunning. Don Was is a genius producer who took what was already a very simple, straightforward man and his music and brought even more clarity and definition to his work. Listening to it through speakers is like having Kristofferson in your living room. Just a great great sound to this CD. So simple and yet so beautiful all the way around."
