3,Self-love,"This is not a review of the content, but a review of the physical book. I was so disappointed that the paper used was of such poor quality and the print itself was not clear, actually seems blurry. I'm sure I will enjoy the content, if I can force myself to read it."
4,Great diaper rash cream!,"I try to avoid chemicals in all aspects of my life and that of my family. The ingredient list is short on this and it is effective for clearing up diaper rash on my baby. It also scores low on the safe cosmetics database, which is a good thing."
4,A book like the content.........to tickle the tastbuds,"What could be better than a nice piece of Melton Mowbray Pork pie from that town of the same name in rural Leicestershire, England.The book has it all,the history, the Photographs and best of all the recpies and method of ""hand raising"" your own pork pies.Buy it and try it and you will be able to eat more than your words."
3,"Title says great for Homeowner, I disagree","Pictures are great and info is good too. My main complaint is the the book and index is arranged alphabetical by botanical name and not common name. There is no common name index or cross reference either. It does give common names on the individual pages, so you might find what you are looking for by browsing the 411 pages. I fail to see how this is homowner freindly unless you are a homeowner that happens to have have a degree in hortoculture."
3,"Good designs, but somewhat difficult to follow","While I enjoyed the designs in this book and got many ideas, I found the actual following of putting the quilts together difficult. It seemed that I was jumping back and forth between the actual pattern I was making and the basic instructions in the front of the book. I understand that making it to one's own desired size is difficult to cover but I ended up calculating all of my own setting and corner triangles."
5,Great Camera,"I bought this video camera 5 years ago. let me tell you, it is still working great. I have never had problems with it. I thoight I might need a new updated version, but I didnt. I went to my daughters play in school. I ended up sitting in the last row. I thought that the video would be bad.... that I was too far away. but The video came out fine...I was able to zoom into her little face. Poor thing.....she was in the back where they put the not so good performers.The camera has zoom, fade in and out, list messages to put on screen , if you lost the cassette adapter like i did you can hook it up to the AV cables in your tv."
3,Biblical roots,"Anyone studying the word of God should read this edition. It is not perfect, there are some mistakes, and some aurthor opinions, but at must read for understandig the roots of the christian faith."
1,Book didn't age well!,"Don't read this book expecting a typical Karen Robards book. This was one of her earliest books -- and it was written in a time when rapist heroes were accepted.The hero (and I use that term loosely) is so insanely jealous that he could have been a guest on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show. He rapes the heroine, yells at her, abuses her... The heroine is little better, for she is stubborn and childish in the most foot-stomping of ways.The saddest part of this book is that Cathy and Jon went through all this in their first book, Island Flame. You'd think he would've figured out by now that he could trust her -- after all, he married her at the end of the first book!Oh, before I forget, this book also has violence, a vomit scene, misunderstandings, and even a cat fight. There is plenty of adventure, but it's lost amid the name calling, rapes, humiliation, and foot-stomping.I gave this book an F at All About Romance."
1,dysfunctional and abusive isn't sexy,"This book really bothered me. I guess it was aiming for readers with different tastes than I have. I like characters who develop mutual respect and grow to love one another. This book was about a couple that became so abusive to each other that in real life, prison terms and restraining orders would have been issued. They are cruel and selfish for the whole book, making the ""happy ending"" absurd. I didn't find it romantic or sexy. This book really made me curse my inability to stop reading a book once I start it. It was so opposite of love that when I finished reading the book I tore it in half and threw it away in disgust."
2,Very frustrating storyline,"One thing I really hate is when an author repeatedly has the heroine taking all manner of abuse from the ""hero"". When Cathy says ""I hate you"" An hour later she's back in bed with him. Come on Ms. Robards give her a break!!"
3,shocking,"I liked the first of these two books but I have never seen a hero in a romantic novel that was so abusive. I at times couldnt put it down because I was so shocked at some of the things he did. It was pretty surprising to read a book that you think will be an adventure in romance and then see it is ""how to abuse a woman and have her still love you"". I thought the first one was better but this one was too far over the top. Karen Robards is a very good author I just wish her hero was more of a decent guy. I could meet this guy anywhere!"
1,Lord have mercy,"This is not, as others have stated, the best example of this author's work. Tediously one dimensional characters, an unsavory ""hero"", a brat of a heroine. Really immature, unlikable characters. This book could have been cut by half and still it would be a tedious slog. Read her more recent efforts for much better fiction."
2,disappointing,Not nearly enough photos of the Loop or so many of Chicago's architectural highlights. Way too much of this book involves rural images far from the downtown. Even the downtown photos were not that great. Above Chicago is a much better book -- I should have bought that one first.
1,Dull & Disjointed,"Let me start by saying that Ms. Evans is clearly a talented photographer. The photographs are well executed technically. It's unclear what she wants to communicate, however. The subject matter is pretty much all over the board, from Sammy Sosa to steel mills to suburbia. Is this a travelogue? Social commentary? Art? It's hard to say. Others have done each of these better than Ms. Evans in ""Revealing Chicago"". I think this book is mostly about ""elevation"", but that's not enough.Perhaps the worst thing that can be said about any artistic endeavor is that it's uninteresting. I personally find that's the case here. With several notable exceptions, the work simply doesn't capture the imagination on any level, positive or negative. I was born in Chicago, and have lived here most of my life; I don't find this to be a celebration of Chicago, nor does it make me rethink my experience of Chicago at all."
4,The Meaning of It All,"This collection of photos is not designed to celebrate the tall, pretty buildings of Chicago; this is not a glorification of the wonderful architecture. Conceived of on one of the most important cusps in Chicago history, a point in time when the life force of the town could either have remained stagnant (as it had for the last half of the 20th century), or taken a new direction and improved itself through knowledge of its own being, this collection serves to illuminate some very real issues in Chicagoland concerning the environment, industry, commerce, sociality, and recreation. It is a beautiful mending of form and function to fill even Louis Sullivan with envy. Perhaps one won't understand the beauty of ""steel mills [and] deserted beaches"" if one does not live in, love, and fully embrace the Chicagoland area. But, for those who do, this collection should prove to be a wonderfully insightful and uncouthly beautiful profile of this beloved Second City."
1,Cheap ..,"This is the worst made rack I've ever seen - If you could hang more than a pound on here I'd be surprised . I am forced to give it one star because it won't let me post a zero .Photo is totally misleading - Pegs are barely an inch long ... wood slats are are 1/8 inch thick (Yes, I measured ) You would be hard put to hang a mug on here and hope it didn't fall off .I am a carpenter , and from the picture , I thought it was worth the money instead of making it myself -WRONG !!!!!"
3,Price R,"Item was what I was looking for , but not built very sturdy , smaller than what I had anticipated. After hanging up one of the pegs broke off and of course ware the bracket was for hanging, a little wood glue fixed it but just not the quality I expected"
1,"Unfinished cheap, thin wood.",This thing is so cheap I doubt it would hold my keys. The wood is also unsealed and splintery. The picture is deceivingly good at making it look identical to another similar rack I have. This is not even half the quality of my other one. Do not buy.
1,Unbelievably flimsy...,"thereby proving once again that you get what you pay for. And hardwood? Hardly; more like balsa wood. This might be suitable for very light-weight decorative items, but is inadequate for anything else."
1,You can get the same product $12 cheaper - from Amazon!,"This product seems to have no advantage over the product which bears the same name, without the words ""for Skype"".Why would you buy this when the Quickcam 5000 (without the words ""for Skype"" attached to it) for $12 cheaper? From AMAZON!Check it out:Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 WebCam"
4,Good book that is straight to the point and provides practical advice,This is a great book for any level.It provides great examples and plenty of opportunities for experiential learning. Very easy to follow
4,Reflect on what you stand for,"This book is a collection of 100 short articles. Each subject gets a brief paragraph, some book references and quotes. The subjects are not new - you would have found them mentioned in other motivational books as well.You would be aware of a third of the ideas mentioned. However, the author has an interesting way of bringing the subjects to life. There are many book references to further reading.This small book can trigger thoughts across multiple subject areas. It forces you to reflect on what you are doing with your life and what can get focus."
5,"Sterling Silver 6mm Round Cubic Zirconia Tennis Bracelet, 7.25""","Beautiful, clear, pristine clarity and color of the stones, sterling silver, and chain. Perfect length, size for a thin wrist. Wonderful detail and quality. Exactly as described with attention to craftsmanship from the manufacturer. Could not be more pleased with our purchase."
4,Excellent vocals,"This Cd is the best audio product of the play ""WEST SIDE STORY"" I have ever heard. Johnny Mathis in the sixties was my favorite until this one. One can never go wrong with Michael Ball as the vocalist."
1,"I never ate green eggs before, but I ate green ham.","I dont like Dr.Suess books because they bore the heack out of me. The illistrations were lame,but after a while of constantly staring at them in discust, they were just really funny. Because they werefunny,Igave them 2 stars."
4,Rene's Review,"I like the book Green Eggs and Ham because it is an easy book to read.Since I don't really like to read this is an easy book to read. And what I like the most of the book is that it makes over a hundred words that rhyme. This book was written by one of the most famous authors ,Dr.Seuss."
5,short,"eggs and ham are a delicacy to be savored. He tries every manner of presentation with this ""nouveau cuisine""--in a house, with a mouse, in a box, with a fox, with a goat, on a boat--to no avail. Then finally, finally the doubter caves under the tremendous pressure exerted by the tireless Sam-I-am. And guess what? Well, you probably know what happens, but even after reading Green Eggs and Ham the thousandth time, that green eggs and ham are ""so good, so good, you see"" is still a rush."
3,"delicious book, don't judge food by colour!","the green eggs and ham look yummy but judging by it's colour, that furball refuses to eat the dish ""sam I am"" keeps bombarding him with and they go so far until he actually tries it and it's good. I think the book is silly but it does teach not to judge food by how strange it may look cause of it's colour or form, cause you're missing out on the delicious taste, and this is a subject that young kids could relate to if they are being fussy with food. Also recommended if you're reading this to your young child is to cook eggs with them and put in green food colouring or any other colour to show that it tastes the same even if it appears different from usual"
4,Funny Book,"This is a great book for younger kids because it reads very easy, they like the idea of green food, and can start to rhyme with the words. The book has nice pictures and has been read many times at our house."
5,Fine album by underrated artist,"This is a superb album on several levels. Roden is a powerfully emotional singer who is not prone to self-indulgence. The songs are well chosen and concisely performed. There is no doubt that this is one of the ignored gems of what was the rock era. Sadly, Jess Roden has 2 even better albums that have never made it to CD: The Player Not the Game and Stonechaser. These are gorgeous albums. Please, Island Records, release these titles on CD!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I saw this DVD in a store, and bought it almost immediately. The minute I popped it in the player, I was disappointed.It's a very boring DVD. Now, I'm no yoga slouch, but some of the positions were a little difficult - but not so much difficult as tedious. The sound quality was awful - not just difficult to hear, but it fluctuated depending on where she was facing. And, to be honest, I can't even remember if there's music.I was hoping to unlock bedroomy fun, and was left boredly hitting the fast forward button. If you want to feel sexy, I suggest getting another, slightly more active DVD - like Carmen Elektra's strip tease aerobics. A totally different ball field, but guaranteed to put a little spice in your life."
5,Great Gift!,"I gave this to my friend as a gift for her Bachelorette party. It was a huge hit!She told me she and her new husband did the tape together on their honeymoon!!So - i got one for myself, and a bunch for people for Christmas already.Its definitely yoga with a twist. A sexy twist.My hips are looser and I definitely am feeling better in the bedroom.I've only done the tqape about 4 times, and am feeling results already.Highly recommend for you or a friend."
3,Another track list,"Just bought this today at Best Buy in Arlington, VA. The cover of the CD is identical to the picture for this amazon listing, however the track list is as follows. I have not listened to the CD itself as it is a gift.1. House of fun2. Don't look back3. Wings of a dove4. The young and the old5. My girl6. Stepping into line7. Baggy trousers8. The business9. Embarrassment10. One's second thoughtlessness11. Grey day12. Memories13. It must be love14. Deceives the eye15. Driving in my car16. Animal farm"
4,Great tape!,I love this tape! It keeps changing instructors so you never get bored and it goes quickly. I like this video because it combines toning with aerobics. You need a step and a pair of dumbbells.
1,Dissatisfied,"I am an avid amateur photographer that needed a compact camera for vacations. I have always used manual focus SLR's so I was totally unfamiliar with auto anything. In making a decision on my purchase, I tried to stick with brand names. I was familiar with Canon products in the SLR arena and was always quite pleased. However, not wanting to put my eggs in one basket, I chose Minolta. WHAT A MISTAKE. The camera worked well for the first 3 months, taking brilliant color photos. After that it was down hill quickly. The camera would auto-advance the film went it felt like it, Would double and even triple expose frames, overlap frames, etc. I changed batteries, film types, and film brands in hopes of fixing the situation but none worked. In speaking with Minolta service center representatives I learned that the cost of even estimating the repairs was (...)not very cost effective. Turns out this is just an expensive disposable camera. I think I'll stick to Canon from now on."
1,what a rip,great on delivery but bad product the snaps broke the first time I put the boots on.What a deal....not planning to continue use of this item.after seeing no response guess I'll have to share my disappointment with my friends....To no surprise;the bottom of the right foot is already falling off. Beware this one
3,A Decent Book for a Conservative,"Habermas does a decent job of providing some evidence for Christianity. On the positive side, this book often provides good aurguments either for Christianity or against it's opponents. The downside is Habermas is often inconsitent and after ""establishing the credibility of the NT"" he uses it as a source supporting his position quite often. Based on the title you would expect a much deeper look into non-canonical sources. The author is also guilty of both making assumptions and a priori conclusions, two problems he often points out (coreectly) in other. Since I consider myself a moderate, i feel that this book is a good addition to my library as it provides a good balance to book by liberal authors such as John Dominic Crossan who are guilty of the same problems as Habermas (primarily focusing on the conclusion rather than the facts). If you are looking for a more scholarly work I would suggest N.T. Wright."
5,"One of the very best on the topic, share with everyone!!",To put it succinctly: Anyone who reads this and still believes the illogic of the skeptics and naysayers isn't thinking at all! Difinitive and logical proof.
1,Same old tired arguments,"if one was to mount a court case arguing that mr habermas is simply writing dribble to the masses hoping that they do not have access to the overwhelming arguments that destroy his beliefs, then this book would need to be evidence #1. sober christians have long conceded that outside the bible there is no early, independent evidence to the existence of jesus. possessing an almost super-human ability to ignore the facts, mr habermas trots out josephus, suetonius, pliny, tacitus and co. when fellow ebay on-line reviewers such as 'A reader from PA, USA August 16, 1999' triumphantly claim 'Anyone who reads this and still believes the illogic of the skeptics and naysayers isn't thinking at all' only buttress sceptical contentions that the strongest argument that christianity is pure myth is surely the fact that the apologists continue to produce works of this calibre."
4,thug review,The book itself is awesome. I would recommend it to every person interested in undersatanding God's heart. Amazon met all my needs in a timely manner and has always been very profesional.
2,Sadly a Middling Review,"I read UK reviews of this series before I ordered. I like the heroine but it took me almost the whole book to get to that stage. I felt like I was reading the first in the series because she had no guts or courage, but this book is 3rd or 4th in the series. If I had read the first then I would have cast this aside knowing how objectionable all the charactgers, supposedly the heroine's friends, all were. Finally, Ellie gets some gumption and some guts and wins the day. She is appealing. I am hoping for better because I can see the possibilities. I enjoyed the style of writing and the final conclusion. This is definitely a British heroine (in her early 60s) with a village background. An American heroine would have been more brash and determined, and kicked the daughter up the butt by Chapter Two. Ellie will grow on you. I am willing to give this series one more try."
2,dissapointment,"I was seeking travel books on Africa and came accross Malaria Dreams which had high ratings and some praise. Double dissapointment with the book and with the rating system on Amazon. I would rather spend an afternoon getting a root canal then finish this book. If you consider car shopping and maintenance in Africa an adventure, this book's for you. My copy went to garbage as I couldn't maintain interest."
5,sheshe's review,"This is a story of faith, forgiveness, humbling oneself, and atonement of sins made right. I have had this movie in my library many years. When it became available on DVD I had to have it. I love to watch Frank Sinatra and Spencer Tracy work together. The musical score is haunting - but then that is what makes a movie - as far as I am concerned! The Devil may have come at 4 O'Clock - but he was too late, they were already saved!"
2,Frank Sinatra & Spencer Tracy TRY to make a film together!,"I both LIKE and HATE this film. I like the idea of redemption that is put forth as the premise of this film, BUT I hate the overacting involved by most of the actors involved. It could have been so much better. Still it was shot on location (mostly) in Hawaii before it became a tourist trap so the backdrops are beautiful. Too bad Old Blue Eyes overacts and stinks it all up."
3,The Devil Won't Wait,"Any fan of Spencer Tracy will like this movie. None of his movies move fast but at an even pace. The effects are good, even by todays standards. If you like Tracy in ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" or ""The Mountain"" you will like this movie. If you enjoy any of the older disaster movies you will certainly find this worth watching. If you like movies with characters fighting personal problems while trying to stay alive from a disaster you will like it. Quite honestly if anyone doesn't enjoy it they just have to short of an attention span."
2,They jumped into hell to save part of heaven.,"Spencer Tracy plays an old priest on a small tropical island who's given to starting his mornings with more than a wee bit `a cognac. Frank Sinatra is one of three convicts Father Tracy gets to work on the mountaintop leper colony. The volcano on the island belches and spews and, eventually, erupts.THE DEVIL AT FOUR O'CLOCK is a looong (over two hours) melodrama that has one thing going for it - Spencer Tracy as the broken priest. If you enjoy watching priest led kids and convicts spend an hour running away from lava and praying for a hardening rain this one might keep you on the edge of your sleep... er, seat.Recommended for fans of Spencer Tracy only."
3,Swiss name but made in China ....,"of rather light-weight plastic and metal. Make sure you follow the instructions:Do NOT use non-stick cookie sheets or parchment.Make sure the cookie sheets are cold.It was hard to find cookie sheets that were not non-stick on Amazon. I finally went with the WearEver line but have since changed to the highly rated Chicago Metallic 'Natural'. I hope, after ordering the 'non' non-stick sheets, it works. Will update with a more positive review (I hope). Till then, the best I can do is 3 Stars.03/02/06 update: Go with the Sunbeam set. It is about 1/3 the cost and seems sturdily built with more bells and whistles. Both are Chinese."
2,Rikon Cookie Press,"I actually used this for the first time last night and was very disappointed. The barrel is very small, as were the cookies. I make a spritz cookie and then ice 2 together with chocolate icing like a sandwich and even the largest disc didn't make the cookies big enough. I ended up getting a disc from an old press, but that didn't work all that great, either!! I bought my daughter one and I am thinking of returning it."
4,Almost Perfect,"I am a long-time Mirro cookie press user. The handle on my Mirro press finally broke so I thought I would upgrade. I bought a Bonjour press that turned out to be useless (way too weak) for my purposes, so then bought the Kuhn Rikon based upon the many positive reviews. This press makes very nice cookies, offers more shapes than you will probably ever need, and despite its small size the barrel holds enough dough for a batch of about two dozen. The only weakness of the press is that it won't work with really stiff (dry or cold) dough, so the shapes ""melt"" a bit during baking. The Mirro press is the best I've found in this regard, but the Kuhn-Rikon press is much easier to use."
2,Great Movie-- HORRIBLE QUALITY DVD!,What a great horror film. I was very annoyed at the TERRIBLE QUALITY of this transfer to DVD. Find the VHS version-- far better picture and sound. The video version better than the DVD? What a shame...
3,Sent wrong item,"I ordered the paperback edition and the seller sent me a hardback copy. I didn't want to go through the hassle and money of returning the item, but I really wanted the paperback."
5,The Best Book ever!!!,"The Polar Express will leave you with a warm feeling. All the smells and memories of childhood will come floating back to you. I read this to my youngest daughter when she was 3 and she totally fell in love with it. Every Christmas since then she gets something with a silver bell on it. It has ranged from a sterling silver bell on a ring to a dime store bell, but she has kept them all and loves them. My other daughter liked the book, but did not feel the same way."
5,It's a hit,"My 4 year old grandson had me read this book to him over and over, especially after we took a ride on the Polar Express in Williams, AZ."
3,A little disappointed,"I got this especially for my 8 year old who is ""borderline"" about believing in Santa. We watch the movie all the time. The 25th anniversary edition appealed to me so I ordered it last minute for Christmas. I received it today and the bow sticker on the sleeve was peeling, plus the ""keepsake"" ornament is cardboard!"
2,"""Like New"".....but somehow missing a page. :-(","I ordered this book that was rated in ""like new""/ ""excellent"" condition. When the book arrived the book jacket was frayed around the edges and a title page was actually missing. Since I am giving it as a keepsake gift for my kiddos, after our first ride on the ""Polar Express"" to go visit Santa, I am dissappointed. I should have just paid full price and bought new."
4,Engaging Christmas story,"In this book, a small boy sets aside his friends' doubts in Santa Claus. That night, a special train comes to pick him up. The train travels through the forest and around the world, picking up other lucky children. The train finally arrives at the North Pole where Santa is waiting to give the children gifts. Later, the boy returns home with his magical gift from Santa. This book is quite engaging, it although it may not be appropriate for children who have never been exposed to the idea that Santa does not exist. The book contains approximately 1000 words."
3,Am I the only one who thinks this story is a little shallow?,"The illustrations are excellent as is the accompanying CD. My kids enjoyed both very much.So why only 3 stars? It's the story: a boy hops a ride on a train to the North Pole to get a bell so that he can remember that Santa Claus is real...I don't mean to sound sarcastic, but, honestly, there isn't a lot more to this story.This story is an example of style over substance."
3,It's alright....,"I remember when my teacher read us this book when I was in second grade. The whole ""big deal"" about this book was the artwork. If I remember correctly there were only a couple of sentences on every other page. I have no idea what the story is about, the only thing I remember about this book was the great artwork."
5,great book for kids,"This book has great illustrations and is a simple story about the magic of believing in Santa. Be aware that it explores the idea that Santa may not be real, but handles it in a very good way -- leaving it up to the reader to decide. I bought the 25 year anniversary edition and it comes with a CD with Liam Neeson reading the story and an ""ornament"" (it's made of shiny cardboard)."
4,"Collabo Queen Goes It Alone, In Style","Leslie Feist's CV boasts appearances on records by Norweigan folkies Kings Of Convenience, indie collective Broken Social Scene and the scary, hairy Peaches; all of which gives little clue as to the direction of her major label debut Let It Die. Thankfully it's an instantly-accessible mix of minimal jazzy arrangements, sensual ballads and well-honed doo-wop and folk influences. Mushaboom is a quirky pop original, while the Bee Gees' Inside And Out is given a delicately funky, gallic spin. Feist's honey-coated voice glues the various styles together, her breathy tones more than making up for the fact that there's not a collaborator in sight."
5,WICKED,fabulous is all i have to say. listened to it all weekend and can't get it out of my head. from broken social scene to this - just incredible.
5,Thank goodness for college radio...,"...specifically, WKNC (88.1, Raleigh, NC) otherwise I would never have learned about this fantastic CD. Highly recommended for people looking for something downtempo and a little off the beaten path. I suspect tracks will begin showing up on chill compilations over the coming year. Grab a copy now and be cool."
4,"Sweet, Sweet, Bliss","This is a great album. I believe it's one of Feist's firsts to. I has always compared her voice to taking a hot bathe without the water. She has such harmony and this album is full of songs and lyrics that complement her voice. Also the service through Amazon was wonderful as well. I received the album a week before the estimated delivery date! It was a wonderful surprise waiting in my mailbox for me. Feist is my favorite artist, and I think if you give her a chance. She could be yours to. Must Buy!"
2,Amazon playback was poor and service was non-responsive.,"Had group of friends over to enjoy Bogart classics. Playback was dismal, stuttered and finally froze up (only one of three we watched) and complaints to Amazon went unresolved."
3,Cheap ...,"As a Humphrey Bogart fan, it pains me to say this movie was horrible. It is missing something throughtout the film, and it's hard to say what. I wasn't expecting Casablanca or the Big Sleep, but I clearly was disappointed and wanted to turn the movie off several times throughout the film. In general Bogie is the only actor you'll know int his film, or care to know. The plot was almost uninteresting, and never really develops. This movie definately could have used a Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Peter Lorre, or someone else.. Also, there are some lines at the end that are word-for-word out of Maltese Falcon, which shows this films desperation to be a classic, but it's far from it !"
3,Pretty Dry,"I was hoping this book would be a general introduction to the AK, meaning a little history of its development, a little history of its impact on global conflicts, some general overview of design changes, pros and cons of various AKs available to civilians in the US, some background on assembly, drifting the sights, effective use of the weapon (tactics).The book is a very dry read. It is like reading a technical manual. If you like reading the book in your vehicle's glove box, you might like reading this.It is unfortunate because the topic of AKs should make great reading material.Nonetheless, I will keep it as a reference manual. I am sure that it will come in handy if I have to do some minor tinkering with the rifle."
5,great info,"Its a great book , it provide you with information about the AK s and their variation to a point that you can sometime argue an expert, this book is very helpfull ecpecially if your studying CSI and want to be specialised in Ballistics, because it is very Important to know about the weapon beforehand"
5,For the AK owner,Knowing the variations of the AK help to understand the development of the rifle and how it operates. For the Rifleman's library.
1,"nice and compact but bad focus, lighting, and choppy zoom","I returned this product it was so bad. The best part is the size. Minolta had a problem with lighting being off and unfocused pictures that showed that they were focused when taken. fault. When zooming it is very choppy and will stop when and where it wants. It is worth the 10 mm loss to get another brand 140 mm instead, and it will cost about $100.00 less."
5,Great movie for history and sports.,"This movie not only shows a great basketball team, unheralded choice and the racism of the times, but teaches the power of change that America needed."
5,Great sports movie,"This is a wonderful movie. El Paso is my home and I have seen many a Miner game in my time. I was born a year after this happened but I grew up a serious Miner fan so I became very familiar with the story. I have seen many of Haskins teams and they always played hard with good defense as the movie shows. As a matter of fact, they had some really great teams in the 80s- one team that was ranked as high as 4 in the nation. But, the best team he ever had is the subject of this well made movie. I love the way this movie shows the importance of teamwork. Also, the movie depicts the nasty treatment of the players by many. The basketball player actors are great. Lucas is great as Haskins and Haskins is great as the gas attendant!! Now Miner fans are hoping Mike Price can take the football team down the glory road."
3,Less than what I wanted,"Everything was in order, no markings on the pages or plates but the overall condition was not as good as I expected. No dust jacket and the hard cover quite worn. Cost higher than it should have been."
5,great ball workout,"this is an ideal video to get your abs trained the right way while using a stability ball. I have other ab tapes, but this ball workout is effective and gets your abs burning, my midsection is trimming down and i feel this video is the reason why."
1,Disappointed,I teach a stability ball group fitness class and I bought this DVD to add some new ab exercises to my class. I was really disappointed. The exercises aren't effective and some didn't even target my abs! For a great total body workout try Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout.
2,ANOTHER FALLEN IDOL.,"These songs are generic pop music garbage.""I lost You"" is a nice attempt at what Katharine's voice should sound like, however it is still missing something...""Dangerous"" is just Dangerously bad.And Please Kat... don't sell out. Put some Clothes on.Period."
3,Selected Poems,"Peter Hargitai did an excellent job translating this book of poems written by Attlila Jozsef. These poems describe Jozsef's life. His life was very unpleasant from what I understood as I read. First off, he dealt with communism. His parents were not always there for him, or so it seamed. He felt very lonely as his life went on and did not seem to want to live for long. I found this poem rather sad in the way Jozsef lived his life of anguish."
5,Selected Poems Attila József,"Selected Poems by Attila József consists of a series of five sections in which various poems portray poverty, longing for home - Hungary, his loves, and the fascination with his mother. I can relate to being with my mother as a child, sleeping in her bed and being taken care of. I also feel the desire to see home. Although I was born a Jamaican-American, I would like to visit my other country - Jamaica. József was born in Budapest and was one of the greatest writers of his time. Peter Hargitai brings his work to ""our times."" I recommend these poems and give it five stars."
3,Attila Jozsef's Selected Poems,"Attila Jozsef's Selected Poems, translated by Peter Hargitai, commemorates one- hundred years of change to world literature. One hundred poems separated into five different categories of struggle, which the author has faced. Although I think poems are quite lame I started becoming attached to Attila Jozsef's Selected Poems. While at first I found the poems difficult to understand as I eased into the book I became more aware of what was going on and who and what the author was referring to. Jozsef writes about how he is so deeply in love with his mother, his struggle to find and believe in God, his loneliness, as well as his struggle with the working class. Attila took out the anger built up inside of him by writing poetry. I highly recommend this book of selected poems to all those who enjoy suspense when reading."
3,"Ensavor Microwavable Meal, Burgundy Bee",It was just okay. Nothing to get excited over. It's eatable. I've had much worse. It's worth it for the convenience.
3,Pathetic propaganda,"A freelance journalist-investigator published a book of 9/11 presenting a historic barbarian act of terrorism as a part of conspiracy theories so loved by islamists and pro-islamists -whether real supporters or simply a sort of dissidents criticizing any US-government-to-date customarily.His story drowns attention from different sides of mentioned with, resulted into tragedy for this young smarty and his fellows, a hot sex in-between.A pre-owned DVD I acquired bears ""Pathetic propaganda"" hand-written by the pre-viewer on an invisible side of a jacket.Well, that is a sharp characterization also a curvy illogical story was well-presented and easy-watching.A DVD Extras explores a huge set of R-rated movies, horror, gore, sex on any preference."
5,brilliant,"The book is superb.Is it biased? you bet. (It's called 'opinion'). So whatyou should do is what you should do: read several bookson the subject!Even though the book is probably better suited to personswith some knowledge of anthopological theory, beginnerscan benefit from it too, provided they complement thereading with other (more pro Geertz) texts.Even though I do not agree with the author's standing atevery point, I have to admit that the book is written withfairness and dedication. Will make you think."
4,oldie but goody,"the last of an inbred aristocratic family takes on big women in the bedroom, interior decoration, cooking a meal entirely themed in the color black, and aesthetics in general. its all written in that seemingly intellectual banner which might cause one to actually fall asleep if they can't throw themselves back into the portal of time and have the courage to appreciate it. read while drinking wine and you'll really be a loser."
1,"After much research, I'm back to square one...","Reading reviews and ratings on multiple photography and electronics sites, I was hoping I found a winner in the Minolta Freedom Zoom EX Panorama Date Kit. This camera has all the features (and then some) I was looking for in a camera -- lightweight, zoom lens, panoramic, date stamp, multiple flash modes, etc...). Brought the pictures in to get developed -- I used 400 Speed film and got the pictures developed on Kodak Gold paper... Much to my dismay, the pictures weren't very sharp -- grainy in fact -- and many of them were dark (yes, I had the flash on!) My 12 yr old Canon point and shoot delivers better pictures than this puppy...All in all -- nice camera, great features, good name for the money -- but not very impressive pictures... I've returned the camera and I will probably end up foregoing the panorama and zoom for better picture quality and try the highly rated Yashica T-4 Super with Carl Zeiss Tessar lens."
5,- Mark Schusheim Shone! Brilliant example of a spaghetti western,"Mark Schusheim was scintillating as the sadistic bald-headed townsperson with a heart of gold in his tough,but sensitive, portrayal of a cad, kicking a dog and rubbing his own shiny head in glee after the scalping of an Indian (nee gypsy), a newly crowned baldie. I particluarly noted the genius of the layered reading of his line, ""Gold"", rivaling Brando and Dean, though not necessarily in that order.He was lean. He was mean, with a diasthema to rival Alfred E. Newman and the body of a street tough. For all you Schusheim fans, this is one for your collection: a don't-miss experience!"
2,terrible trash,"I purchased this movie from amazon because of the online reviews.This film is terrible. Bad acting, directing, and poor editing... there is a scene where you can see truck tire tracks in the sand. Tomas Milan seems to have little concern about anything that is going on around him.I have no Idea how this trash achieved such a cult following.I own a large number of spagetti westerns and this one is by far the worst. Even for the 60's this is a bad film.. period."
2,"This camera is so-so, in comparison to its competition...","It's not that this camera is *bad* camera, but I had to give it a 2 when you look at its competition. My biggest beef with this camera was the autofocus. It hunted way too long, and this often gave way to poor shots with out-of-focus subjects. It's not so bad when you are photographing a posed shot, but candid shots were often screwed up because of this. The autoflash was also consistenly poor, making for mediocre indoor shots.<..."
3,Not that nice,"Bought these as I was getting ready to replace the control arms in my Blazer. The cams were flat and looked as if simply punched out of a steel plate. The original cams were machined, and rounded, to allow for easier turning during alignment. I ended up just re-using the old cams and bolts, as they seemed better made."
4,great sandal,"this piece of footwear is worth the money and time. the arroyo II fit like a glove. this is probably the most comfortable footwear that i own. i was hesitant to move away from my usual brand of sandal, but i am totally happy that i did. i wear these everyday. take the dog for a walk, play with the children or just walk around everyday use."
3,arroyo II hiking shoe,Comfortable and works well with my shoe inserts. The soles are thick and heavier than what I need. The lacing system is weird. I've thought about cutting off the plastic lace lock mechanism and simply tie the shoe. Not my favoritie sandal.
3,Love Keen but laces wouldn't stay tight,I own multiple pairs of Keen and think they are generally the best shoes around in their price range. Big help in healing an excruciatingly painful heal problem. But... the fastener used to keep the laces on this model snug just won't do it. A few steps and the laces/shoes are loose again.
5,Best shoes ever,"I have been wearing Keen sandals like this ever since I discovered them a couple years ago. I have a wide foot and these sandals fit! They are listed as a med width but I get them a half size larger and they fit my foot perfect.This is a good price for them and I am tempted to buy another pair now for when these wear out....Excellent sandal, excellent shoe company....Brian"
3,A Bit disappointing,"I read in reviews that the laces become undone, and thought, ""That happens with any and all shoes!"". The laces on my Arroyos did become undone - about every thirty yards. I ordered and will fit the new laces soon and see how that fares. Overall, it is a great ""all terrain shoe"" -- provided all the terrains are smooth and flat. Stay away from grassy trails and by no means entrust yourself to them when you wade through water. They take a very long time to dry, and act as if they are designed to collect thorny grass seeds."
4,Great for traveling,I bought these before i spent 2 weeks in guatemala. I brouhgt these and my flipflops and i never used the flipflops.We did quite a bit of walking and light hiking and these worked great the whole time. My feet never felt sore. The only downside is i have to wear sock or my feet get real sweaty. When i wear socks they breathe better and they are great for any hot weather environment. The heels is very supportive and they look cooler than the sandals. We went swimming in a rivver in guatemala they protect your feet real well and float your feet up.
5,Great for travel,"I got these for a trip to the pacific northwest. Was able to use them for sea kayaking, walking around town, and going out to dinner. Very comfortable and a nice upgrade from my older Keens that did not have the full heel (those were great for tromping around Costa Rica)."
5,Great family oriented movie,"Got this movie for my mom last christmas, she like freaked out, she loves little house on the prairie. She made us watch it and honestly its a pretty good movie, great for the family. The story is great and clean, nothing like all the bad movies today. This is a must get if you or know anyone that loves little house on the prairie."
3,"Nice, Enjoyable Christmas Presentation of the Past","I grew up when ""The Little House on the Prairie"" was originally broadcast and remember the early years best (all series become long in the tooth after about five seasons). So, I vaguely remembered the episode 'A Christmas at Plum Creek' (which I feel is the better of the two here), but both seemed quite new to me, after all these years. My wife and I enjoy watching this one each year. I Netflix'd the Pilot episode this year, just after Thanksgiving (it's not really Christmas, but has a Christmas scene). Where it was interesting to see the very first Ingalls adaptation, I would stick with the regular show, myself. It was just too raw and a bit too long. It didn't have the same hope and feeling of the show. So I would stick with this one, instead, for the holidays."
5,HOT to death!!,"This video is an excellent documentation of the energy def jam brung to 125th street in Harlem, NYC! conatins concert footage/interviews with cormega, foxy brown, method man, red man, eric sermon, keith murry, ONYX, the lox, DMX!! A definate must have for a true hiphop fan!"
4,John Cowan never fails to impress.,John Cowan is one of my favorites. My love for him goes back to his days in New Grass Revival. I look forward to the next CD.
3,The title should have been KOUMADIN KOOKBOOK,"THE MAVEN IN THE KITCHEN, MY WIFE, SAYS 'IT WAS PRETTY GOOD'. SHE IS AN INVENTIVE AND CAUTIOUS COOK. WHEN I WAS DISCOVERED TO HAVE HAD A PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND MY MDS PLACED ME ON COUMADIN, I WAS TOLD TO AVOID LARGE AMTS OF VITAMIN K. IRRITATINGLY THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX/CAN ALMOST NEVER - IN OUR EXPERIENCE NEVER - TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF VIT K IN THE PRODUCT. THE RECIPES ARE HELPFUL."
1,Gig Bag for autoharp,The supplier I ordered it from was out of it and evidently didn't plan to restock.
2,commerical for another kids song dvd in middle of songs??,the characters are scary to me but my 18mo grandson didnt seem to mind. he was swaying to the soft music but that kept getting interrupted by excited talking by the characters and then commercials for other kids songs dvds with more upbeat and louder music. weird.
3,worth the price,"I liked the videos, but the instructor won't stop talking. You have the option to work out without narration, but she is so annoying that you almost can't work out with it long enough to go without the talking. You feel like your in elementary school again. She talks to you like you have never worked out before. But the workout is hard, and once you do it enough to get past the talking its not so bad."
4,if you like lotte berke workouts you will love this,"this is essentially a lotte berk workout without the slowness or mumbo jumbo that the lotte berk dvd's make you sit through. It is quite good and will give you a good anaerobic non-impact workout. For aerobic workout, look elsewhere. Also, if you have back problems or are not flexible this may pose some issues. however, if you have a dance background, this is heaven!"
5,The Bar Method is great!,"I love this workout. I work out at a gym about 5 days per week, but now I am exercising at home 3 of these days so I can incorporate the bar method into my workouts. It hits muscles that are difficult to exert and in a very controlled, isolated method. If you do these moves properly, you will see results."
5,Love Bar Method - this is a keeper!,"This is a great slimming, toning workout. By the third workout I noticed my thighs, especially my inner thighs contouring and reshaping. I definately felt it in my buns the next day and feel that lifting as well. I do alternate the Bar Method with my other DVD's since I feel that I need more cardio. I tend to get bulky with my legs, so this workout will slenderize your legs and make them leaner looking. My sister and I inquired if they will be making new Bar Method DVD's and they are in production this month of July 2008 and will be coming out in the Fall of 2008. Well that is what they say. I will be definately purchasing their new DVD's since I know that Burr came out with some new excercise positions that are not in the older DVDs that came out in 2003."
4,Nice versitle piece,"Very nice cake dome that does extra duty as chip & dip or punch bowl. This one is less delicate than the pedistal one from the same manufacturer, so I expect it will hold up better. However the dome is not quite as high or as bulbous as the very delicate one (hence only 4 stars). Unless you make huge cakes, the sturdiness and versatility of this one makes it a better value."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"The order clearly shows 2 rotors that are either slotted or drilled and the product I recieved was only 1 rotor, plain."
4,"Boy, talk about a guilty pleasure .....","This isn't for fans of B movies, it doesn't rate nearly that high. It's maybe a D movie, or even an E movie. And it's greatest accomplishment may be to prove that you can shoot 78 minutes of film on a budget of maybe $8, tops. But you know what, it's fun, the gore is silly, the dialogue unspeakable (literally and figuratively), the production values little-to-none ..... but it eventually offered lots of laughs, some intentional, some not, and I had fun watching it. So you know what? I'm throwing four stars at it. Bite me. And Mary Jackson can come to my house for dinner any time. Hubba hubba, wotta babe."
2,Quit While You're Ahead,"I won't go into the plot since it is well described in another review. My problem with this film is that it is just too long and directionless. Early in the film it is a half decent black comedy with over the top gore (which prevents it from becoming scary or suspenseful), and the special f/x and performances are pretty good for the very low budget. But after a while the constant bickering between the cannibalistic family members just becomes annoying and the wait for anything resembling a plot progression becomes unbearable. It seems the scriptwriter's main goal was to showcase his skill at penning insults. Read Peter Milligan's graphic novel ""Eaters"" instead for a black comedy about a family of cannibals that has actual wit and biting satire."
4,I WAS THERE WHEN,"I HAVE HAD THIS ALBUM IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE ONE HAD TO BE THERE TO FULLY ENJOY THIS BAND TO ME THE ALBUM IS A 5 STAR. I NOW HAVE IT ON CD AND IT'S GREAT. ESPECIALLY THE LONG JAMMIN' STUFF. I SAW THE DRUMMER, STEVE ABOUT 9 YEARS BACK. AND HE DID'NT EVEN HAVE A COPY OF THE ALBUM AT THAT TIME, IF YOU LIKE GARGE BAND HEAD MUSIC OF THE 60's THIS IS A CLASSIC."
3,Works So Far,"Unless these batteries are made differently than the last ones I had, or are the product of some new technology (disguised as yesterday's product), I have little hope of them lasting longer than a year or two with limited use. That's what I got out of the last ones. But this seemed to be the cheaper way to go. Otherwise I would have had to invest in whole different brand of drill and light kit, just to get a different battery with it that may have been the same. So, I rated this one three stars, because (A) they work so far and (B) I'm not sure if the ones I just got are better or not. Check back with me in a year or two."
5,I Still Remember,"I read this book when I was about 7 years old. I read many many books, but this is the only one I remember specifically from that early time. That was before I knew who Asimov was, or that he was to become my favorite writer as a teenager.Over 30 years later, I still remember this book as being an introduction to elements and the periodic table. I can still picture the chapter-head illustrations and the explaination of how everything in one column is basically the same.I suppose it had an effect on my learning about the world from the get-go. After all, I remember details about =this= book, out of the hundreds that formed my knowledge of science and the universe.Asimov speaks to his readers. If you get anything out of his short essays, imagine a book-length treatment."
4,Great for beginners,"This video is great for beginners. Teaches you to stretch properly.Easy to follow instructions, but not just an easy workout if you are just starting out. Not super for abs, but helps with flexibility."
1,Just when I thought I had seen the cheesiest movie. Then i watched this,"This movie doesn't even deserve 1 star. more like a 1/4 a star. WOW. A killer pinata. What's next? If you're looking for a movie that will make you crap your pants, THIS IS NOT YOUR MOVIE! I bet i could be sittin on the crapper and think of a movie to describe my experiences that would be better than this film. Unless you want to stare at the hot chick in this movie, just don't even look at it. Can you imagine the sequel. PINATA': Attack of the killer candies within! Chicken run had better animation. The original KING KONG from the 30's had a six inch doll that looked more realistic."
2,"a real ""shove in the bottom drawer"" book","It's hard to add much to Josh's review, and perhaps I shouldn't, as I put this book down after page 114. I too found myself skipping long (slow) passages and growing tired at the never-ending parrallels drawn between the Coen's work and that of other film-makers. I would have preferred to hear more of what the brothers had to say, rather than the theories and beliefs of their biographer.If you're after an in-depth study at how the Coen Brothers go about making a movie, buy William Preston Robertson's ""The Making of Joel & Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski"". It's a better read by far."
1,Wasted Writing Effort and a Waste of Your Time,"The author of this book obviously feels he's as witty as the Coens. I hate to break it to him, but he's not. To make up for underachievement in this area, he fills the book with unneeded ""editorial"" comments on the films themselves. Why does the author feel he needs to criticize Jon Polito's performance in Miller's Crossing, and why does he think we'd care? It simply feels the author is stretching for lack of material, since he probably didn't get much cooperation from the filmmakers themselves. I attempted to make it through the entire book but kept putting it down out of frustration with the author. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,Wonderful!! 30 Classic Love songs,"If you are a Kenny Rogers fan, this CD is a must. It is fantastic. My father who is 80 years old loved the old songs, especially Stardust."
4,"Great hardback book, nice photos great text","More than I expected. Informative, great pictures, good text. Nice hardback book. A great deal for the $$$."
4,"Beginner level video, pretty good.","This video is pretty much a beginner video which explains basic concepts and operation of a pool and spa. It goes through the thought process and show you what everything is and how to use it. If you were hoping for a video that goes a little deeper such as, how to winterize the pool, this isn't the video. The default answer to anything more than back flushing the filter is ""Call a professional"". Overall, a good beginner overview."
2,Not a Classic!,This is a 1937 film that is not a classic. It is just a run of the mill film which gives a few mildly amusing scenes otherwise it's almost completely unfunny. Leslie Howard's character is rather boring and he has almost no emotional range. Bogart's name was moved up the credit list into first place on the DVD packaging for modern audience recognition. Joan Blondel was rather amusing but even this was not enough to save the picture.
1,You will either love it or hate it,"This is one of those books that polarizes people: either they love it or they hate it. I'm in the latter camp.This is a rule-based method: your children will learn lots of spelling/phonics rules either before or while learning how to read (mostly before). My girls found this exasperating, and so did I. My opinion is that rules can be taught *as* they are needed rather than before. However, enough people swear by this method that I'm *sure* it has its merits.Find a copy to look at before you buy it. Read it thoroughly. Like many people, I found the book difficult to understand even after reading it from cover to cover three times.This method looks inexpensive until you add up the cost of supplemental books, classes, etc. For the price of those things, there are many other programs out there which are much easier to use and have more child appeal. My suggestion is to keep looking."
4,Throw away your phonics books,"For some reason, people think that educating a child has to be like a trip to an amusement park. This program is a back-to-basics reading and writing course for ages 4-8 years. You do not need any computer programs, glitzy readers, or workbooks, just paper and a pencil. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is that the recording that comes with it is on an old-fashioned record, and so far I cannot find anywhere to play it. Hopefully the publisher will change to CD or cassette format in the near future."
1,The Watch that didn't work,"I have asked what was wrong several emails, 2 ordered 2 different ones and they didn't work.What was wrong with the watch??? It is a beautiful watch, I would love to own one, but they didn't work.I would buy another if you sent it working."
5,The perfect natural brow!,"Ever see those gals with the obviously painted brow?? Well they aren't using this product!! The amount of brow powder is substantial considering the tiny container. This color is perfect for those with blonde hair and fair skin. I have used this product consistently through the following shades of blonde: brownish blonde, strawberry blonde, beach blonde, & platinum blonde. It's not too dark, or too light. I love it. I only have to purchase one of these every 9-12 months- it lasts that long. It goes on soft and smooth. If you do apply too much, just blend it with your finger or a makeup sponge and it evens out perfectly."
3,stinky,"The shoe is to die for. Very sexy and comfy. HOwever, when it arrives and you open the package, grap the air freshener. The material its made of stnks, or maybe its the glue used...like smelly feet. If your gonna wear this perfume it down and don't take em off unless your all alone....Good Luck."
3,ok,"this book was ok. i was hoping for more information, such as stages the puppy will go through. i never had a dog before this one, so i needed more information on things like teething, and other stages of life. the book was helpful though concerning some things like digging."
5,Found at Last,"The Ark by Margot Benary IsbertThe ArkThis is a great book that I orginally read as a teenager. I have been looking for a copy for a number of years. ""The Ark"" and i'ts sequel ""Rowan Farm"" by Margot Benary-Isbert tell a wonderful story about a family finding hope during hard times. I think this is a story that not only speaks to a real time in history but relates to current times, dealing with issues such as the aftermath of war, the plight of refugees and what a large miracle a little hope can create."
1,amerifit,"don't buy amerifit, it is not working, buy other brand! i purchased it because of the price but again the old proverbe - the chipper is more expensive! i use it for a month - NOTHING changed!, so, i'm moving to another brand. i'm experiencing severe hot flashes, on 1/2-1 hour frequency, already 7 years!, tried many different pills, herbs, some are working the first time, the second - not, so i decided to live with my hot flashes..., then red on amazon.com, that a lot of women are happy with estroven, but one said: ""be careful about the ingridients"", so different companies making estroven with different ingridients!!!!!??????????, why not - how to explain the differences in the prices!!! american pharmaceuticals!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - so, i'll try other brand now..., good luck to you all!"
3,What A Shame,"We should all be ashamed. We fell in love with 3 little girls from Detroit. All the bad things that happened in the group was because of their age... they were just 20 when sucsess overtook them. They were babies, and not equiped with the maturity to handle the attention bestowed upon them. Yes, egos were running rampart, but it was the magic of the 3 of them together that enthralled me and everyone else. Yes, its a shame that their story has so many bad chapters, ...I wish that the Cinderella story had better endings...but I will always envision the 3 girls together, making magic, music, style and beauty,...all 3 of them. Why it has turned out to be such ugliness and division is truly a shame. Diana, Mary & Florence, thank you for sharing your dream,.. entertaining me for many years. I love all 3 of you."
5,Great Classic Boot,Bought this boot in patent leather and liked it so much that I'm ordering another color. Great heel height and very sexy looking. Definitely need to order 1/2 size up to fit properly.
3,A major disappointment,"If you love musical theatre works from 1866 thru 1960 - this is the book for you. Exhaustively researched. However, if you never ended the affair, and love Sondheim, Coleman, Fosse, Kander & Ebb, Champion, Lapine, Tune, Bennett, McNally, Herman, Hamlisch, Patinkin, Peters and LuPone - well, this probably ISN'T the book for you. The first 100 years are wonderfully detailed. Six paragraphs on ""Show Boat"" alone. Great. However, the author seems to have lost interest in his subject matter. The greatest shows of the past forty years are lucky to get a single paragraph. The last sections of the book feel passionless and rushed, the reportage at best perfunctory. It's too bad that someone like Ethan Mordan couldn't revisit and revise these decades. $ - wow! Listen, buy a used copy of the first edition (it goes up to 1978), than look for some of Mordan's books or Ken Mendelbaum's ""Not Since Carrie."""
4,Run away train,Note if you are looking for Tom Petty that sing s this song it is not him it is the group called Soul Asylum. You want the one that has the lead singers face on the album of the CD. trust me I just bought it and I now own it but he does sound like Tom Petty besides I have a friend who knows the truth. Tom petty sings run away train s (with an s) on!!!it wasm't the one that I was looking for where it starts out withCall you up in the middle of the night ending run away train never going backThx MedicineP.S. Soul Asylium is still kool too I would recommend him with Tom PettyListen to him for your self he does sound like Tom
1,greatest hits of ????????????????????????????,"No Artist(s) group(s) shown!! No picture, review, or rating???An yet it is worth over $30.00???? Must be pot-luck, eh!!!"
2,I was tricked by Trick Daddy!,This album had to be the worst album he ever put out. He will get sales on pure hype. He aint even on most of the CD. A lot of the beats are terrible and the CD's first song didnt come out strong at all. May I say I made a bug mistake in buying this album. I could have got someone to burn the good songs on there for me. Even though its only like 3 or four of those. Trick you tricked me man!!! Dont ever put out garbage like this again.
1,didn't work for my Persian Cat,I couldn't get the blade under the mat. Possibly because my Persians hairi is so fine it wouldn't even cut the hair.
4,"Well, Excuse Me, Princess!","This is a DVD release of the 1989 animated series, The Legend Of Zelda, based on the first two Zelda games on the classic Nintendo(1985). This series was created by DIC Entertainment for airing every Friday, as part of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show(1989).Unfortunatly this DVD only contains three episodes of the series, and two unrelated episodes of Sonic Underground. UAV should have put more episodes since their are a total of 13. Or at least put instead two episodes of Captain N, The GameMaster(another Nintendo based animated series by DIC) that included Link and Zelda(thier were 4 episodes). Thanks, Remember for everything thats made someone out thier has to like it, otherwise it wouldnt have been created."
4,Beautiful rug at a good price,"I originally saw this rug at Home Depot, but they have discontinued it and 8 x 10 was gone. I called the manufacturer and was pointed to this rug on Amazon. The colors are much more vibrant than the picture shows (without being obnoxious with the colors) and the rug is absolutely lovely. I get compliments on it often.The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is not quite as good a quality as the one I saw at Home Depot, and the pile is very thin. But at the price, I certainly can't complain. All in all, this is a great rug at a nice price."
4,The Jewish Phenomenon,"This book contains great insights into the cultural aspects of the Jewish people, and why throughout history they have been successful. These habits, thought process and perspectives are transferable."
4,not the easiest clean up,"it does work great, however i think mine is missing the clean up piece. i ordered this on 1/23/06 and it did NOT come with the insert. however, besides having to use a toothpick to clean it; it works great. plus, there are only a few holes that clogged so it doesn't take forever to clean, however, i thought it would be super easy to clean. it isn't."
3,Wrong item,"The product I received was not the one I ordered. Very similar, same company, just a different model, and not the one I ordered. I decided to just keep the one that I was sent because it was too much of a hassle to return it."
5,Great Product! Highly Recommended!!!,"This is simply the best garlic press I've ever used.It's just the right size (not too big and not too small), highly efficient, durable, and easy to clean (non-stick).Made in Switzerland."
4,"Best Press, But....","Maybe we get tougher-skinned garlic down here in Florida, or maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but I have never been able to press garlic with the skin on. Just never worked for me, and thus the 4 stars.Having said that, however, this is absolutely the best garlic press I have ever owned -- I have already tossed my others into our ""garage sale"" box.Totally easy to use and to clean; substantial feel without the weight or bulk; all of which is very important to me since I have very small hands and intermittent carpal tunnel problems.I bought this on the recommendation of Cooks Illustrated magazine (the Consumer Reports of the kitchen), and I heartily concur."
1,"Where's my garlic press, Target?","I had this garlic press before and loved it. It got left behind when we went on a trip. I was glad to see the same one--made in Switzerland--still available. Unfortunately, I have TWICE ordered this item from Target and TWICE they have shipped me the wrong item. If this is no longer available, they should no longer offer it for sale. In the meantime, I have had to pay two shipping charges and two restocking fees for the privilege of receiving and returning an item I did not order."
3,detachable = bad,The trouble with this is that the little detachable hole-cleaner is almost guaranteed to get lost. Better to buy one with the cleaner/poker attached.
5,Royal Albert Old Country Roses,A small problem in shipping was met with a gracious discount and apology. I was quite impressed with Fortunoff's Hewlitt's response.
2,why?,"peter gabriel is peter gabriel. the residents are the residents. pink floyd is pink floyd. although primus makes the songs more inventive, primus is primus. they just don't mix."
2,not worth dropping in to visit,"After watching it I found out it was a remake. I would have rather wasted my time on the original with subtitles than a revisit which was boring. Not that I think the original was any better, but at least it was a new idea."
5,Excellent Book to Learn French!,"This workbook is a very good book for a beginner. It teaches you French grammar very well. There are dialogues at the beggining of every chapter that has new vocabulary words for you to learn. This workbook was set up very well and teaches you all the basics of grammar and vocabulary, and a little beyond. I think you should buy this book if you really want to learn good French."
3,Sent it back,"You get what you pay for, and this was a pretty inexpensive frame, but the wood frame was cracked at one or two of the corners and I decided to send it back."
3,"Worth reading, but . . .","The author has too much of a fondness for unnecessary violent sexual scenes and excessive use of expletives for my taste. On the other hand, the descriptions of East Africa are fascinating. A map would have been useful for those of us not familiar with obscure locations, real or fictionalized because the action takes place in many locations with names such as Mara Serena Lodge, Fig Tree Camp, Chogoria Track, Keekorok and Noro Maro Lodge, all spread over Kenya, and that's just to name a few. This thriller is well-plotted, although I wondered when reading it, if the main character, Gabe, if he was so in love with his wife back in America, never once called her on his satellite phone for over a month."
2,Not her best work,"This book was not her best work! Like the second book in this series, it was a let down for me. I am a huge fan of her writing, but this is not what she normally writes like. I would recommend the Dragonriders of Pern or the Powers that Be series, which are much better than this one! The second book in this series is not any better than this one, so if you did not like this one, don't bother with the second. This is a good one to get from the library before buying. I guess every writer has to have a few bad books."
3,Very disappointing. I've read all of Anne's books. This wa,"I have read all of Anne McCaffrey's books at least three times, but have yet to complete this book once. I keep coming back to it hoping it will become a better read. It's hard to follow, the characters seem shallow and it just doesn't have the flair I have come to expect from Anne McCaffrey"
5,"great book, read it!!","i read Dinosaur Planet once, and then i had to read it again!! i really think that Anne McCaffrey is a GREAT author!! i really love how she created the plot and it was really hard to guess what would happen next. i also read Dinosaur Planet Survivors, i think that you should read that one too, because they both go together."
1,Lousy...,Purchased this teapot along with 2 coffee presses. (which are great) Teapot uses a rubber gasket to form seal between plunger and tea container. Gasket comes loose due to poor fit. Called Bodum about this and they asked me to send the inner workings to them. Meshita from customer service (if you want to call it that) said they would replace/fix the problem. Two weeks later... same gasket and container returned to me... no note... no explanation. Returning to Amazon for a refund. Will stick with the coffee presses from this company.
1,"Loud, not educational at all","This toy is loud and obnoxious. I don't see how it is educational at all. It is also not fun for my one year old. My three older children are eligible for Mensa and they did not play with this type of toy. It also does not fit in with my educational philosophy. There is no stimulation for the imagination here -- it is the same thing over and over. And it is made in China. Once you put it together, it cannot come apart, so it will never fit into the box again. I called Fisher-Price and they refused to take the piece of plastic junk back -- my reasons weren't good enough (!!!) So, this expensive twaddle will sit out for the trash pickup -- and I will never purchase anything from Mattel/Fisher-Price again."
5,Gorillas in the mist...,"I really like the huge gorilla face on this shirt. The quality of the shirt and printing are amazing. The design rivals any boutique couture tshirt with allover print. Awesome shirt, buy it, but if I see you wearing it, I might punch you in the gorilla's nose for copying my fresh style."
3,Ready to chop?,"Chopping is a breeze with the Zyliss chopper with cup. I was happy with the product until it came time to clean the chopper. It is pretty difficult to clean. I admit it was kinda scary trying to clean up inside the sharp blades. But over all this chopper was not going back to the store. The time you save is worth it, not to mention my burning eyes when I'm chopping onions is gone. This thing chops everything from nuts to ice to potatoes. But then I just found the other day the new improved ""Zyliss COMFORT food chopper."" It's a big improvement to this one. Clean up is a cinch now that the sides open to give you full access to the blades and it even comes with a sturdy bendable chopping mat. I know there are a few other imitation choppers out there but now I'm completly satisfied that I own the best of the choppers. The only reason I gave the Zyliss chopper with cup a 3 was because the improved version is just so much better."
4,"Encouraging book with a positive, cheerful outlook","Having spent time with dying friends, I found this to be an encouraging, cheerful book. I appreciated the positive emphasis on attitude, and also the information about saying goodbye to a dying person, giving that person permission to leave. Also, I appreciated how much the author revealed of his own feelings about death and dying."
3,A powerful message but not scientifically prooven,"Bernie's central theme is that there is a strong correlation between emotional health and physical health. However he rarely cites any scientific evidence for his claim. He keeps repeating this message based on his experiences with random patients. Surely one can conclude many things from random patients, but a theory has to applicable accross a large sample. There has to be a 'control' if the study is to have any scientific merit. I wished he had shown more of these studies.This would definitely be a five star book had the author been more scientific in prooving his point. Nevertheless I do personally agree with it."
4,Effective,"This was recommended to me for my almost 3 year old grandson. He had recently experienced an emotional trama and in addition to being a screamy child anyway, he was having continual melt downs and nightmares. His behavior was spilling over onto his 1 year old brother who was starting to act out after being the calm child. Used this in combination with Calms Forte 4 Kids. This was very effective in calming down the child and over a period of weeks, we were able to cut down on the dose. However, he still needs to use this but it is only once or twice a day now."
3,Nothing new here.,"If you are trying to lose weight then this might help as a bit of motivation but I really don't think it offers anything new.SPOILER ALERT - The message in the book can be summed up in one sentence - ""Stop drinking alcohol and reduce your portion size."" That really is it. I found the author quite amusing and the book was free so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,Nothing New,"This book doesn't give any new advice towards losing weight and states the obvious that you should eat less. However, it can be slightly motivational if you want to read about how someone successfully lost weight and kept it off."
1,"A ""Cheese Grater"" That Doesn't Grate Cheese? Who Knew?","Since I am a certified, card-carrying cheese lover, my (now ex) boyfriend gave this to me as a thoughtful, out-of-nowhere gesture. Frankly, I was so excited that I couldn't wait to break out a nice bottle of vino and grate myself some Romano!However, I was sorely dissapointed when it just didn't work.The issue with its design has to do with the crank or ""thing that you turn."" Since it was so short, I could not get the leverage necessary to make it work. Because of this, the cheese came out in clumps or not at all.I would advise cheese enthusiasts to spend a little extra money for a better-constructed grater -- or else buy the grated cheese in a can."
4,there's no substitute for fresh grated cheese!,This is a very fine grater and so much better than the straight plane graters. It is very good for hard cheeses and sometimes for chocolate. It is not good for softer cheeses like Cheddar unless you cool them down in the freezer first. Soft warm cheeses tend to clump together in long strands and are difficult to get out of the cyclinder. We use this grater several times a week for our pasta dishes and even keep the cheese in it in the refridgerator. It cleans up easily and at five years out is showing no wear.
5,Excellent book,"I worked as a geriatric social worker and assisted families to manage their caregiving role, particularly when it involved dementia. This became my favorite book to recommend to families. It is a basic, easy to read book that also puts across a powerful message on how to be a successful caring person for what is a very challenging time in a person's life. Dementia is very challenging because it starts slowly and can be terribly frustrating for the caregivers. I was able to get the local library to obtain a copy and was able to refer folks there if they were not able to purchase the book. I am worried that for some reason it is not currently in print! That would be a terrible shame. I love this book. I am also a family member in the caregiving role, so the book is meaningful on a personal as well as professional level."
4,haunted by loss of love and ideals,"I really liked both this movie and the book by Scott Spencer. Both deal w/ the age old argument-is social justice something that can be achieved by working within ""the system"" or is it something that needs to be approached from outside? This movie/book works as a love story but also as a meditation on the loss of ideals (or the realization of how bound up ideals & ego are)and the compromises people (and particularly liberal politicians) must face when trying to ""be good."" FYI Don't expect a lot of bonus material on this DVD"
3,LOVE AFTER DEATH,"WAKING THE DEAD is one of those movies that even though its competently done with very good production values, I just didn't find it entertaining. It's a rather somber love story well acted by Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly.Set in the early 1970s and the early 1980s, the story follows Crudup, an up and coming brilliant law student who wants to be president someday. Connelly is the girl he falls for, and she's a radical who takes on all kinds of causes, ultimately ending in her tragic death...or is she really dead?In the 80s, Crudup starts seeing Connelly and thinks she might be losing his mind, which wouldn't serve his goals as a candidate for Congress.The movie is long on dialogue and director Keith Gordon gives us some pretty visual images and elicits good performances from the cast.But the real situation with Connelly's fate is romanticized and ultimately left for us to decide the truth.Romantics will probably enjoy this a little more than I did."
4,Great period piece,Pink Narcissus is both wonderfully intriguing and humorously amateurish.The quality of vintage porn & primitive pastiche give this film it's timeless fascination.
1,Just a Warning!,I would suggest that you rent this before buying it! Unlike the reviews above it was one of the worst thing I have ever seen. I walked out of the theatre on this and there were many people on the lobby that walked out before me! This is not a film for everyone and requires a very special taste! There was no story...that I could see just a bunch of clips that made no sense.
1,What's the point???,"I bought this DVD because the shopper recommended it.I'm particularly like to see Art House movies,but not this one.It's the most confusing,nonsense,and disgusting thing I've ever seen.What's the point?I don't know.How it's become a classic film?I much more do not have any idea.If you wanna see some movies artistic,I recommend you to see other Art House movies such as Sex and Lucia or an Iranian movie,Gabbeh.You'll be more impressed.But if you wanna see the movie about gays,why don't you look at Happy together,Lanyu,or Trick?They're more worth seeing than this.This's just my feeling about this movie.Do not believe me all at once!See it yourselves if you've wanted to see it since first.But...but...if you don't have any interest in the movie,your feeling might be true."
3,It hits the high points,"This DVD is an affordable alternative to classroom training. The delivery is dry and boring at times. But it does cover the major function points of SPPS 2003. It is a great way to get started using SPPS 2003.One thing I found frustrating was that some of the chapters would end abruptly. For example, chapter 7 ends while the speaker is in mid sentence and appears to have several more ideas to convey. To that end, I sent 3 or 4 emails to dvpress.com with no reply. As of this writing, DNS is unable to resolve dvpress.com, however whois claims they have the name until 2010."
3,Blu-ray Edition,"A woman pretends her husband isn't dead long enough to get the will changed so she'll get something out of it. The whole thing twists into a 'whodunnit' pretty quickly. Decently done and interestingly shot, Coppola's first director credit milked every penny out of its meager budget.This Blu-ray release is from ""HD Cinema Classics"", who are quickly gaining a reputation for their lousy soft-image transfers. This one's no different, looking more like an up converted DVD than anything. Their ""comparison"" feature showing the print before and after the DNR process gives me the impression that their print scanning is every bit the problem as their cleanup process. But for around 12 bucks, I guess you get what you pay for.Hopefully, somebody will do better in the future."
4,Underwater tombstones and beheaded women.,"DEMENTIA 13 was Francis Ford Coppola's feature film debut. For that reason alone the movie is worth watching. However, besides that fact, the film stands up as a fairly decent piece of classic thriller/horror. In many ways the movie parallels another thriller/horror classic: PSYCHO. Both films begin with a beautiful blond committing a crime who ends up coming to an untimely and gruesome demise about halfway through the story. Though Psycho hid the identity of the killer a little better, it's pretty obvious in both films who the murderer is. The acting in the film is believable and the use of lighting is rather creative, adding to the movie's tone.Overall, a underrated horror classic worth watching on it's own merit's and not just those of it's director."
4,A b-movie classic for lovers of obscurity!,"Dementia 13 is one of Coppola's first and most memorable films. It is an extremely obscure b-movie horror flick and this version is one of the best copies that I have seen on video. I got the widescreen version, wanting to enjoy every inch of film possible. I was a little dissapointed since the letter-boxing is very small and doesn't offer much more than the regular edition though it still has more of the film than you would normally see."
4,PSP Protection,"The screen cover is a one-time-use item, which is rather nice for protecting the easily scratched PSP screen. The package contains only one cover, but this is usually enough (unless you are a coal miner or work with explosives all day.) As the package contains only one screen it's rather cheap as well, which is the way it should be. As a last note, the adhesive is designed specifically to leave no residue once the cover is removed, which is a nice touch."
5,does its job just fine,"easy to apply, looks good, good instructions, what else do you need for a dollar? why does a decent ipad protector cost 10x as much?"
4,Adequate Screen Protector,"I purchased this item to protect the screen on my PSP 1001. It's an inexpensive one-time use item that will function as intended/advertised: protect against scratches, dust, and smudges. Dimensions are nearly perfect; there's a slight margin of error, but that's to be expected. Protector is clear and won't interfere with device performance. Directions are clear enough. I recommend taking extreme care when applying the screen lest dust or air pockets become trapped under the screen protector."
3,Here the Man,"No need to watch Will Smith imitate him, here you can see and hear Ali as he was, in his prime, as man who confronted greatness."
5,Great Gift for Boxer Fans,"I bought this DVD for my finacee for his birthday and he was excited. He said he has not seen this movie since it left theatres and after watching it, he said it was a classic that you can watch over and over again and he is so happy to have it in his collection."
5,Important & fascinating history of the California Grape Strike,"The California Grape Strike, which started in 1965, was a watershed event for farm laborers in American history. This strike not only resulted in widespread organization of farm laborers, but it also catapulted Cesar Chavez into the limelight.John Dunne was an observer and a participant in many of the activities during the strike period. This book is the culmination of his effort to recreate the event. The book is largely a memoir, with some analysis of Chavez's legacy and the importance of farm worker organization. Above all, it is an important source of material for anyone trying to understand 1960's labor history within the confines of Latin American/Chicano history or western history. Since this is primarily a memoir, there are no footnotes or sources included, nor is there a bibliography or an index - these are the only weakenesses of the book, and are not significant enough to detract from the importance of the subject matter."
5,"Clancy, Cussler, and a touch of Ludlum all rolled into one!","Drawing on real life experiences in Desert Storm, Charles Jaco is a combination of Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler with a hint of Robert Ludlum. There's international intrigue, military conflict, mystery, and of course a love interest. Dead Air will keep you guessing up to the very end.This certainly doesn't read like a first novel. I can hardly wait for the next one!"
1,Drivel,"It's hard to think of anything positive to say about this novel. I suppose that some of the technical military details the author worked into the story are mildly interesting. But the plot is silly, the characters are cartoonish, and the writing is absolutely amateurish. I'm shocked that something this bad is considered publishable. Ballantine Books should be ashamed of itself."
4,A great sequel to neuromancer,"William Gibson stays true to the cyberpunk universe he created and finds a way to tell a story of art in a future world, intrigue, and the struggle for a new kind of immortality.If you liked Neuromancer, you'll like Mona Lisa Overdrive."
3,Tough to Review,"Compared to almost every other book around, this is a wonderful read. Compared to Neuromancer, however, it's a bit of a letdown.It's funny. The writing itself is better in this book. The characters are more rounded and Gibson is a lot more assured when it comes to pace and descripions. But as technically brilliant he's become, he wrote a check with the first novel that the next two sequels couldn't cash. Mona Lisa Overdrive lacks a certain amount of passion and though he was something of a cypher, it doesn't have a character as powerful as Case. Even Molly, who makes a reappearance here, came across as a shadow of her previous self.Still, if you like Neuromancer and Count Zero, this is a pretty good conclusion to the trilogy."
1,Hopelessly inaccurate,"McCarthy is way off the mark with every area he touches on. Customers would be far better advised to find out about Catholicism from authors who know what it really is .This author maybe has a chip on his shoulder, but misrepresenting Catholicism is hardly a solution."
1,Biased,As a former Protestant minister who is now a Catholic priest this is not the resource you need to understand Catholicism. I would suggest you start with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. McCarthy's bias and bigotry are not very subtle.
2,Doesn't Last,"My wife has asthma, and uses this when she has a problem with her asthma. She liked it, but in trying to replaces the batteries, the case cracked. She doesn't have huge strong hands, but she managed to destroy it just in changing the batteries. I tried super glue, so we will see how it goes, but I'm not happy with the less-than-stellar longevity.It's compact and electronic, so it's easy to carry in a purse or a suitcase. I'm just not happy having to spend a fair amount of money to replace a device only a couple of years old. I expected more out of this product."
5,Let's hear it for the girl!,"I think Cameron Díaz is about to become the female Malcolm McDowell! She's not afraid to appear in darker-than-dark comedies, or to mock her angelic image and cherubic smile.In this day and age when every celebrity wants to be seen politically-correct, nice-to-all-humankind and compassionate-to-the-less-fortunate, it takes a lot of guts to swim against the current current in Hollywood and play questionable roles like this.My only complaint is... she hasn't danced since The Mask, and she's one helluva sexy dancer! Cameron, if you're reading this ...wanna dance? I'm no Cuban, but hey, nobody's perfect! (Well, maybe you are)"
3,"A bit too morbid, even for some Pulp fiction fans.","If you are a fan of of such dark comedies as Pulp Fiction or Fargo you will be a little disappointed. It was a bit too morbid, and I don't mind morbid. Make this movie your choice only after exhausting most others. And you might want to watch it without your girl-friend or wife. Do not buy, rent it only if you like morbid plots."
1,One of the sickest movies ever,"I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie.The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be."
1,"What is funny about murder, blood, and killing?","I watched this movie because it was billed as a comedy. Yet, as I watched, I kept asking myself what in the world is funny--the blood, killing? It was all to real, too intense.The Littleton school killers laughed as they butchered their fellow classmates. They would have enjoyed this kind of movie.Worst of all, it opens a window into how sick and evil our society has become. People are appluading killing instead of condemning this hateful work as evil."
1,Very Bad Movie,"This movie was one of the most horrible pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Having a degree in Film, I tend to look at more than just the story line (actors, direction, etc...) and I can honestly say there was nothing good about this movie. Just the fact that a movie as grisly and demonic as this could be labled as ""comedy"" should be a crime. Viewers will be walking away shaking their heads wondering if they were just in the twilight zone for two hours. This movie is a waste of someone's time to even watch."
2,A Violent and Over-The-Top Black Comedy,"Very Bad Things is a wild black comedy about five friends that go to Las Vegas and have a bachelor party and when one of them invites a stripper,one accidentally murders her and that leads to another murder and then all five bury the two dead bodies in the desert and head back to L.A. and when the wedding is around the corner.Everyone starts killing each other.Some parts are funny but others are so outrageous and wild that it makes this unwatchable and it feels like a wasted rental.Worth a rental or watching on TV(Comedy Central shows it).The excellent cast includes Christian Slater,Cameron Diaz,Jon Favreau,Daniel Stern,Jeremy Piven,Leland Orser,and Jeanne Tripplehorn.Written and directed by Peter Berg"
1,Very Bad Movie,"I did not think that this was a very good comedy whether Dark Humor or not. For me five guys who try to cover up various murders is not that amusing. Cameron Diaz, who played the persistent bride, was lousy and did not seem to fit well into the overall picture.Granted there were some funny moments in the beginning, but things got out of hand in a hurry. After the first two murders, the killings made no sense and the plot went nowhere. There was alot of shouting and yelling in the picture which only made things worse.I am glad I only rented this film and did not pay full price to see such trash. My advice is don't waste your money on this so-called movie."
2,Very Bad Movie,Usually I'm a great fan of black humour. This movie is pretty black... but really does lack the humour!
2,If this is a comedy...,"... this is a very sick comedy. As the title implies, the movie involves some very bad things, indeed. If a comedy involves an exaggeration of something, this one is an exaggeration of the greedy side of human nature that doesn't want to be caught doing anything bad. This is not an exploration of human nature, guilt, or greed; it is an exploitation of these things - a horrible exaggeration."
4,An interesting peek at the secrets friends keep,"The movie starts innocently enough, but as in every great dark comedy things go severely awry.Who is next ? The only thought throughout the movie.Acting is brilliant to say the least and story line has undertones of Tim Burton, Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock.All in all a well rounded movie, a definite must for all collectors of this genre."
3,I expected more comedy and less gore,"Before I saw this movie, I thought it was a comedy. But this movie is so gory and there is so much violence that you shouldn't call it a real comedy. It is a thriller with some funny moments.If you look at it serious, you will probably hate it. But if you don't think about the tragedy and the drama, then it's an enjoyable movie.The performances of the actors are great and there are some very funny scenes.Good to see once, but not twice."
1,Very BAD things is right!,"I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE NO STARS IF I COULD! This movie was horrible. The story was stupid, the acting was HORRIBLE and it was not funny (in any way). I expected better from Camren Diaz. The only thing you should by this movie for is a coster. Please, Please save your well earned money."
1,"Reprehensible, irresponsible poorly concieved snuff-comedy","Everybody involved with this rancid nightmare should be ashamed of themselves. Especially the lame-o stars who took to the TV circuit to say 'It's okay to laugh at this movie' in response to the near unilateral disgust experienced by early audiences. As if it's wacky and funny that five coked-up honkies impale a chinese hooker then stab a black hotel security guard while holding lame, uninteresting discussions about the morality of it all. Cameron Diaz's phone-in role is on screen for all of 3 minutes. A monument to the decline of film company respect for the audience. Why do you think so many of the ads showed only big pink lettering? Because there's nothing worth seeing. Don't confuse this witless work for another Heathers, or Something About Mary. Steer clear. Your eyes and brain will thank you"
2,Key word: Annoying,"Very Bad Things is very hard to sit through, although it had its moments. Slater aside, every single actor manages to annoy the hell out of you throughout the whole move. They accomplish this though constant yelling and profanity. Horrible script. The plot itself is thin; It seems like it was written in about a day. Every thing that happens is totally unbelievable and not realistic. The characters are so annoying, you don't give a damn about them. I would rent something else! ~also Cameron Diaz is hot, but don't rent it because of this. She is not in the movie much, and when she is, you will be ANNOYED"
2,Have they CUT DOWN the quality of these?!,"I've been using these 3M filters (size 20x25x1) for years, with the same 'Comfortmaker' furnace, changing them once a month due to severe allergies that my family has. The last 2 filters were totally collapsed, to where I could not slide them out! Makes me wonder for how long these had been sitting in my furnace collapsed/damaged like this! It seems to me that 3M has significantly cheapened the quality and reinforcement ability of these filters. Shame on them! I will be looking elsewhere."
3,Does it's job.,If you'd read any of my other reviews you'd know I give a 3 as normal and 4-5 are resevered for items that beat expectations. This is a 3. Works as I expected no better no worse.
5,Just as Intended,"These air filters are a hundred times better than the 97 cent crummy filters you buy at Home Depot or Lowes. They let enough air flow through but stop a majority of the micro-dust, etc. Highly recommended."
2,too much resistance,"These specific 3M filters, though good at filtering micron-size particles, do too great of a job. Our fan's motor had burnt out so we had to spend beaucoup bucks for an HVAC repairman to replace it. He told us that he has replaced other fans like ours in homes whose owners use the higher-MERV-rated filters. Apparently, the resistance is too great, causing the fan to wear prematurely. He recommended the cheaper style filters that allow the air to pass more easily. We followed his advice, and the fan sounds less stressed and we've had no problems in past 4 yrs now."
5,Love these filters!,"We have a heat pump furnace and an older, very dusty home. We also have two Pembroke Welsh Corgis so quite a lot of fur and dander. These filters have much improved the air quality during the cold months when the house is shut up and the furnace is on.We use them year round and have never experienced any issues with our unit."
4,Very pretty.... Nice Colors.... Good size,"Love the pendant, very pretty, nice size stones with bright colors. The chain broke the second day, but that's to be expected - I didn't buy it for the chain anyway. So, buy it for the pretty pendant, and get yourself a better chain."
3,Just ok,This book is just ok. I'm not going to write a plot summary. You can get that above from Amazon or the other reviewers. This book has big plot holes. You wonder how things happened and why. Ms. London doesn't really develop the characters fully. I really didn't care if they lived or died. I thought she would tell us a little more about how they got close the first time they were together. If she wanted it to be about the movie then make it about the movie. If she wanted it to be about their past and their possible future together then make it about that because it's obvious Ms. London can't do them both at the same time. She just didn't explore things very deeply. I would recommend this book if you don't care about the plot or if you just want a really quick beach read.
3,Not my favorite summer read,"Extreme Bachelor by Julia London had the main characters struggling through out the book with their relationship. Leah and Micheal had hot romance five years ago but it all when downhill for Leah after Micheal dumped her. Now, five years later, Leah is struggling actress in Hollywood. Michael has been a pure bachelor no true love. They are thrown together and have discover if the love is worth the fight. The twist of danger and hollywood adds some flavor."
1,Zero stars,"""I'm a big Terry Gillam fan...Brazil was genius...but this movie will go down as one of the worst of all time! Boring story, painfully acted and visually dreadful. We wasted 60 minutes of our lives hoping it would get better before we finally gave up. I have never in my life asked for a refund until Brothers Grimm. The theater manager gave a knowing nod and cheerfully refunded us our money. Too bad I can't get a refund for those 60 minutes of my life that was stolen. Miramax/Disney should be ashamed for putting this film into release.""Ditto--except I wasn't smart enough to ask for a refund! *slaps head* Needless to say, this is the only film I ever walked out of. It put my husband and me to sleep. We kept sitting there scratching our heads trying to figure out what was going on before eventually giving up."
1,Do you really wanna know?,"The plot is contorted, like my back after watching this film. The story bounces around, touching slightly, and wrongly, on several of the fairy tales that we all heard about. there were no moments of sheer excitement or raised bar. It was as low as filmmaking gets. Everything was out of order barely making comprehensive sense. It's jumbled. Even the jokes felt strained. It's not worth it. It really isn't worth it."
1,One of my all time LEAST favorite movies,I dont like to write reviews about movies. However in this case I will make an exception. This movie was a jumbled mass of complete garbage. I have read all of the original brothers grimm stories and they are in itself dark enough in their original form to hold up a modern movie. But dont expect any continuity of plot from any one grimm story. Dont expect that any one point in the movie really makes sense. At times the story is so dark people dying left and right and the main characters are marveling at the special effects. Half of the time I was wondering if one of the brothers was retarded or mentally impaired. Usually if a movie is this bad I would walk away and start washing the dishes or something. However this was so bad that I just stood there in shock.
3,Different than expected,"You have to pay attention in the beginning as the Grimm brothers give the viewer their backgrounds. Many characters intrduced quickly. As the movie settles in, it is likeable with the action. Good family movie."
3,the brothers grimm,"good entertainment. It was not the usual role that I injoy watching Matt Damon Play. However, both he and Ledger did a good job. In a word, the movie was amusing. Special effects were good the movie was well deserving of three stars."
2,What happened Mr Gilliam? Did you just need the cash?,"Terry Gilliam is one of my favorite directors, or at least he has directed some of my favorite films.I had forgotten that he directed this terrible film when I watched it this afternoon ,in fact I commented to my friend that this would be a good movie if Terry Gilliam had directed it.When the credits finally rolled I almost cried to see his name there.This is a very bad film.It didnt have to be.It could have been great.But very poor casting, uninspired performances, over use of so so(at best) CGI, a terrible script and the most uninspired and weak direction by a previously artful often edgy and always strong director's career, results in this being a very weak film and it grieves me to feel this way.I can never again trust that a film is good,or even watchable just because it is a Terry Gilliam motion picture."
3,"Not great, but not as bad as some think","I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. It's definitely not a 5-star film, but it's also not a disaster. I disagree with the reviews that criticize the CG effects, which seemed as good as any to me. I also felt that the acting was quite good overall. My main objection was the inconsistent tone of the movie, with comic remarks being injected in scenes that were otherwise dark and forbidding. At times, this worked quite well, but at other times, it just fell flat. Still, it was obvious that the actors and the director had a great time making the film, and their total involvement was the film's saving grace. There was a great deal of time and talent put into the project, and that it fell somewhat short of the goal is no crime."
4,The Brothers Grimm,"It was interesting to see how the characters developed. I was a bit disappointed at first as they came across as flim flam artists. The they got caught up into a ""real life fairytale"" and it was pretty exciting. The ending was not disappointing!"
3,Okay,"I guess this movie was okay because its plot was interesting. The acting was superb. I don't know why, but I expected a lot more when I went to go see this movie. I think those darn trailers are to blame because they made the movie seem so much better. Yes, an okay movie, but if I were you, I would just rent it."
1,Could Have Been Sooooooooooo Much Better!,"Saw this yesterday, didn't expect anything and that's pretty much what I got. Some of the special effects were cool, the storyline was very weak to say the least, I can appreciate the intertwining of the classic fairy tales however the gags pretty much made you go hugh? through the whole flick. Matt Damon should stick to his Bourne parts and stay away from this kinda film. I think Ledger was okay, maybe pairing hime with Matthew Mcconahuy would have been a better cast. Don't waste your money, wait til it shows on TV or rent the DVD to say the least, definately not a movie for kids either, then again some of Grimm's tales are pretty Grim as well. I would have much rather seen this be a Tim Burton thing, if he would have been involved would had been kinda like Sleepy Hollow! Oh well, nice try Guys!"
1,One of the worst films ever!,"I'm a big Terry Gillam fan...Brazil was genius...but this movie will go down as one of the worst of all time! Boring story, painfully acted and visually dreadful. We wasted 60 minutes of our lives hoping it would get better before we finally gave up. I have never in my life asked for a refund until Brothers Grimm. The theater manager gave a knowing nod and cheerfully refunded us our money. Too bad I can't get a refund for those 60 minutes of my life that was stolen. Miramax/Disney should be ashamed for putting this film into release."
4,great fantasy,"For those looking for a fantasy fix on the level of Lord of The Rings, this film delivers. In fact the reality elements of the story make the fantasy all the more frightening. These were good roles for the leads and all the supporting players were great. This film is neither biography nor a Grimm fairy tale. Rather you get the story of the storytellers dropped into the midst of an adventure that proves more real than they ever thought possible."
5,Not your childrens fairy tales,"In conjunction with what the times must have actually been like when these stories were originally written, this is an excellent peek into the true minds of the Brothers Grimm and what shadows besieged the thought processes of those days."
2,Grim and unenchanting.,"No chemistry between the actors. Thin plot line. Such a good idea, such a mediocre result."
1,"Beautiful sets, nothing else","An absolute mess that tries to be an adventure story, a silly farce, a serious drama, and a scary mystery. It ends up being none of the above, just a chaotic mess. It looks like a lot of beautiful sets were built for this movie, which made me keep thinking, ""What a waste of beautiful sets."""
1,hollywood trash,"nothing works here. the acting is poor, the attempts at creating atmosphere are hamstrung by the copious addition of cheese, its too scary for kids and too stupid for adults. I had to stop watching after 25 minutes it was so painful."
4,van helsing done one better,"if you liked van helsing then this one will rock your socks offit is a story about two brothers that con people by praying on thier superstitions but one daythier trickery catches up to them and they have to come to gripswith the real thingthe story incorperates alot of childrens stories into itsuch as repunsel, sleeping beauty, cinderela, red riding hood,and more"
2,the brothers gruesome,I love Heath and I like Damon. The cruelty gag-jokes against animals weren't humorous. Needed to knock back a few drinks to watch the movie to the end.
5,Great purchase,The watch is the same as in stores. The only difference is in the warranty which is Amazon warranty instead of manufacturer warranty. The watch works fine and looks awesome. It also comes in a great packaging as well.
4,excellent art criticism for the neophyte,"this book is a surprisingly accessible work on the lives of five important artists (duchamp, cage, tinguely, rauschenberg, and cunningham) of the avant-garde, each working from a different discipline. tomkins has gathered exhaustive biographical data on each artist and the reader gets the impression that he is good friends with each of them. his critical stance on the artwork discussed is respectful, and he refrains from using a lot of artworld jargon. a very entertaining read."
5,timely purchase,Bought this to look up an illustration and found this book to be esencial for anyone who is interested in media literacy. So many parallels with American political media climate today. Good read.
5,great watch,i was concerned that it would not be an authentic movado but it definately was authentic. what an amazing watch at a GREAT price. i went to the store to look at it and fell in love and ended up saving $600 by buying on amazon. i would definately recommend this watch to a friend.
3,Dosnt come with tail gate cap as shown in pictures. Not good :( :(,bed caps are fair quality but there cheap so what do you expect.the tail gate cap should not be highlighted in the picture if it is not sold with the 2 bedside caps.its very misleading and seems to be intentional and without care.
2,Subtitles cut off,If you speak french this dvd is probably fine - but for me there are better dvd's that focus on a dancer's life in a ballet company. The subtitles were cut off at the bottom and on the sides so you either looked at the dvd without knowing what was being said or you struggled to figure out the subtitles since they were only partially shown.
3,Movie. Nothing Else.,"Thought this was the one with special features. They made it quite hard to distinguish which was which. It's minimum packaging, just the film, no goodies. Meh."
5,A good sequel.,"I loved the first Crank, so it would stand to reason that I would want to see the sequel. Sure, there were some bumps in the road, but this is, like the first one, just a fun, action-packed movie. Don't have too high expecations and you will really enjoy it. Also liked--Crank (Widescreen Edition)."
2,Its hyperkinetic style leaves us cold,"**1/2""Crank 2: High Voltage"" plays like a Laz Buhrmann production on crack. This sequel to the 2006 original is one of those frantic, postmodern action pictures, replete with snarky dialogue, cartoonish - though highly graphic - violence, and cut-and-paste visuals.Jason Statham returns as the reformed hit man who has his heart literally ripped out of his chest by a passel of armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and replaced with a mechanical one. Stratham races against the clock searching for his original ticker before the replacement runs out of juice.As conceived and executed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, ""Crank 2"" might have had the makings of a genuine cult classic were it not trying so ridiculously hard to impress us. As it is, the frenetic pacing, cuisinart-style editing, and migraine-inducing visuals wind up merely wearing us out in the end."
1,This DVD Doesn't Work With My Sony Blu Ray,"I love this movie and think it is hysterically funny. Unfortunately, this DVD does not work with my six month old Sony Blu Ray DVD player. I just rented another copy of the DVD to make sure that the issue is not the copy I received, and the rental version had the same issue (it only partially loads and then fails). I would recommend against buying this DVD until this issue is resolved."
1,This movie sucKKKKed!,I simply cannot believe that Jason Statum. A good (not great) action hero would allow his reputation to be used in this fashion. This is easily the worst movie that I have seen in the last ten years. The producers should be castrated with pliers.
1,Need a 0 star rating scale for this Bluray....,"Depending on what Bluray player you have like all have said before, this may or may not work. I have a panasonic dmc-bd65 with external a 4gb PNY usb drive on current firmware and it still will not play but a small square apsect of the movie....F*!#@ng useless. I have hundreds of Blurays and this is the only one that has had any issues....Lionsgate really F!@#ed up this one, since you can't return an opened bluray due to pirating...I'm out $30. Don't buy this unless you want to pay more for the external card or usb drive and still possibly get stiffed!"
4,Crank 2 Blu-ray Fix,"The problem is the BD Live needs somewhere to store updates, if there isn't any internal or external memory on your blu-ray player you will get that small annoying square in the center of your TV screen. The good news is that it is easy to resolve simply by adding memory with a SD Card or USB flash drive.Old blu-ray players may not have a problem, as that hardware lacks any BD Live functionality. And naturally, if you own a PS3, the title plays without problems because of the built in hard drive."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"This movie is beyond awful. I've seen film students projects that were far superior to this and I usually hate those. This movie is zero stars. Everything about this movie sucks from start to finish. There is no plot, it is completely absurd, with horrible acting, a lousy score, rotten choregraphy, and pitiful special effects. It is not funny, scary, or enjoyable in any sense. Everyone involved with this movie should be banned for life from the film industry."
3,the title sells it all,"i think this book is very informative. Barbara knows how to market, and can give you tips on how to do it yourself- gilli moon, author or ""I AM A Professional Artist"""
5,"Excellent, insightful, thoughtfully done","I am a 40+ year old woman who, after several years of ""discussion"" with myself have decided to be childless. This book was very validating and comforting. It will appeal to women of all ages and circumstances. Ms. Casey conducted and edited these women's interviews with a sensitive and caring hand."
1,A Sad Disappointment,"As a big Tony Hillerman fan, I was sadly disappointed in Skeleton Man. It's barely a mystery; Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee do little detecting and the ""mystery"" is solved unrealistically with little more than a few questions, a walk down a trail and dumb luck. Worse, there is little character development. Leaphorn and Chee are not in the book much, and Chee seems quite unlike himself. (His fiance questions whether she wants to marry her ""hard-voiced sergeant."" Hard-voiced? Chee?) And worst of all, several stories in the book are repeated over and over and over. What's happened to this wonderful series?"
3,Weakest of All,"I love Tony Hillerman and the Navajo Tribal Police Series, and this is the first one that I wouldn't give at least four stars to. It just takes too long to get moving - even for this reader who appreciates the Hillerman pace that often reflects the Navaho way of being."
5,:),"Book is good to teach my kids all about the outside. Cooking on the fire, and dutch oven is fun with them. Would reccomend this book"
4,6 volt charger,Seems to work good. Bought two to keep the 6 volt batteries on my wife's model T charged when not in use and appears to be doing that. The price was right.
1,Very Disappointed,"The product fit the phone just fine, but the appearance of the case is not attractive. I like a bargain, but this case looks really, really cheap! It also doesn't provide protection for the external or internal screens, or the key pad.The exterior buttons on the phone are covered up and difficult to use while in the case. I was very disappointed with this product and returned it the day after I received it.I've had much better luck and overall satisfaction with the Body Glove Scuba II case (at a comparable price)."
5,good fit,"This cover is what Batman's cape would feel like. Slips on easily enough and stays on. Cheaper here than at those phone stores, even with shipping."
3,Silicon Skin,"This makes the razor look sleek. However, the skin covers some of the keys makng it difficult to use the phone. I do not use mine any longer."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Not one of the three items I ordered worked! I was so upset but b/c the shipping cost more than the product itself, I couldn't justify sending them back. A classic example of ""you get what you pay for""... this thing is a piece of junk!"
3,Missing Audio Channel,"Works alright - is missing an audio channel so some parts of some songs are inaudible/nonexistent. Works for rock, but if you hit up any classical or anything with complex chord structure, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
2,"Poor quality control, construction","First one I bought, audio cable shorted out after a few months. Purchased a replacement, that one had a snapped circuit board where read head is mounted. Sent that back, bought another one, read head was misaligned and only played through right channel. Overall, I would say this item has very poor quality control and cheap construction. Would recommend looking elsewhere for a cassette adapter."
1,Disappointed with Griffin,"My daughter got me a Griffin cassette adapter for Christmas and I have to say that I'm disappointed (in the product, not in my daughter). The sound is mediocre, but worse, the thing keeps jamming and getting ejected after a few minutes. (I have a 2009 Lexus). I went to Best Buy and asked the salesman if there were a better brand. He showed me one from Monster, which I bought. It works without complications, and the sound seems better."
1,Dont buy this product,"Honestly, i wont recommend anyone to buy this product. I used it for 1 month and after that, it started malfunctioning. When i put the cassette in the player it keeping ejecting itself after 5 seconds. It is so annoying. I used a different universal cassette adapter and its been working perfectly since then.I will advice anyone trying to buy this stuff to just go ahead and get another brand because this thing is not worth a penny of your money!"
2,An honest review,"Okay I have purchased this tape deck twice from Target and had similar results both times. Two things you need to understand:1) When it's brand new, the sound quality is amazing. Don't listen to the other reviews. I've owned many tape deck adaptors and this has got to be the best sound I've heard in my car. (yours might be different)2) It doesn't last. Both times after about a month, maybe two, it breaks. What happens you ask? I really don't know... It's not silence, oh no, it still works. But all the life is sucked out of the music and you're left with this tiny sound, that quite honestly, I'd rather roll the windows down and listen to the wind.So all in all if they could make this deck last it would be a quality product. Certainly a good price on here; Target wants $20 for it. At this point I'm considering emailing Griffin to give them a piece of my mind. Because clearly, there is a design flaw. I hope this review helps you. Good day."
5,One of many,"The only surprise to this book is that it was no surprise. In fact, the idea that Messers. Reagan and Bush, assisted by a cabal of shadow dwellers, would manipulate a democractic vote is now common. The whole affair, meticulously documented in this important book, is put in sharper relief by the recent revelation that Richard Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to Paris to pull a similar stunt, for an identical purpose, in the fall of 1968. Disgraceful. This book should be read in every classroom in America."
4,Good socks - but could breath a little better,"Maybe I should blame it on my shoes, but these socks are thick and could breath better. I've yet to find better socks for the money however and I wear these to work and the gym daily."
1,almost died just now...,"While my feet never smell like roses, these socks seem to amplify and project my foot odor considerably more efficiently than any other sock I've ever worn. They're comfortable, they seem very sturdy, but I could fell a rhinoceros at 100 paces just by taking my shoes off after a day in these."
5,Make your footsies feel fantastic,Full disclosure: I have sweaty feet.More disclosure: I've been searching far and wide for a pair of socks that will wick that sweat away and leave my tootsies dry at the end of the day.Final disclosure: These are those socks. Buy them.
4,Better than plain cotton socks,"I've been using the black socks at work for several years (12 hour shifts in leather boots), and they are great thickness-wise and in the fact that they are slightly more breatheable than cotton socks. I use to buy plain cotton socks but have found that the quality of them has gone way down hill in the last few years (FOL, elastic sucks, material is much thinner than before). I've slowly been replacing crappy cotton socks with these and they are great for everything from working out, casual wear, to work wear. They are a little more expensive, but if thin material and sagging socks bother you...here is your solution."
4,"Great socks, runs a bit small","Socks are great - they don't shed and they do keep my feet dry. My only complaint is that the size (large) was a bit small so on my second order, I requested extra large. Another reviewer commented that the elastic was very tight. I got around that by moving the socks down slightly so it takes some pressure off the leg. Not a big deal for me and at least I don't have to worry about the elastic failing anytime soon and worrying about the socks falling down :) Overall, expensive but pretty decent socks!"
5,The Experience of Insight,"This is the 7th copy I have purchased, giving it to friend whenever I notice that individual could use some insight. It is a book of gentle westernized Buddhist philosophy and rightful thinking. Stressing simple, easy to understand and follow instructions and thoughts. It is not filled with ponderous sayings. Simply mind healthy practices easily incorporated into daily life. It has been for me, a guide to positive thinking and peace, and I hope, will be such to my friend. Thank you Mr. Goldstein !"
2,Disappointing,"I have read all of Stephen Booth's previous Peak District novels and I enjoy the atmosphere he creates and the the way his main characters interact. But he seems to me to be always guilty of putting in rather more detail than necessary on surroundings and people's thoughts. This novel is no exception and would have benefitted from the culling of thirty or forty pages worth of unnecessary detail. This would have made the narrative tighter and more gripping. An example is a frantic chase towards the end of the story where the tension is suddenly suspended by nearly two pages of description of a room the chaser is running through.The story itself is intriguing enough, but in the end the motives for the crimes committed are not particularly compelling. And a major twist at the very end is both silly and unnecessary."
4,A recent phenomenon,"While the racial integration of US universities received wide publicity as it happened, and thence in what are now histories of those times, the sexual integration has garnered far less attention. However, this book brings together many chapters that collectively study the coed movement, if one may call it that.Enough time has elapsed for a detached retrospective. But perhaps the shocking thing about this book is that it wasnt really all that long ago that prestigious universities could blithely deny education to half the race. And have this accepted as the norm. If nothing else, the book is a salutary reminder of how fresh some women's victories are."
1,Does Not Fit 98 Civic Hatchback,"According to the product page after entering vehicle info, this muffler is supposed to fit a 98 Civic Hatch. Unfortunately this is not the case. It is way too long."
5,Carribean Classic,"Barbadian Eddy Grant gives us wonderful laid-back light reggae at its very best. It immediately brings with it a great holiday mood -beach, sun, and sea. The beat is just great. And it is far more palatable than some of the hardcore stuff such as Linton Kwesi Johnson and some of Peter Tosh's works.And great lyrics on love and life , here.Personal favourites are 'Do You Feel My Love?'; 'Time To Let Go', 'I Love You Yes, I Love You', 'Kill em With Kindness ' and especially 'California Style'."
3,Sr. Ramos hace el ridículo. Qué barbaridad!,Debe ser titulado: 'la otra cara de la moneda falsa del bilingüismo: inglañol'
5,Big improvement over standard mops and brooms,"I can dust-mop my 1700 feet of floors in 7-8 minutes with this, picks up well, swivels easily and goes under pretty much any furniture for a great job. Dirt and pet fur really stick to it! I can dip the washing pad in my wash solution, mop a quarter of the floor, redip it to clean and repeat a few times and am done in about 15 minutes. Does not leave streaks behind (I use Simple Green or Pinesol) like my other mop did. Never going back to other products, totally worth the money."
1,Ford's Insanity Exposed,"This book serves as a great companion to Neil Baldwin's Henry Ford and the Jews. It shows in detail the insanity and hypocrisy of Ford's assertions. Ford, who admitedly did much for the development of the industrial economy, was guilty of exactly the type of control he accused the Jews of attepting to exert. Ford owned banks and newspapers. Via his paper, The Dearborn Independent, he published a series of his diatribes against the ""international jew.""This work, based on the debunked Protocals of the Elders of Zion and his own opinions or obsevations (mind you he was a bit of a recluse and saw few people), along with his support of Hitler in WW2, clearly show how it is possible to be both a great influence on the economy and a bad actor in the social and political world.Sadly, Ford family members have spent generations trying to distance themselves from these rants while respecting the economic work of their benefactor."
1,Don't even Rent it.,"Honestly, I feel that one star is too high a rating for this boring title. I bought this game, took it home, beat it and returned it to it's case less than an hour later. That is no exaggeration. You play the story mode as one of the characters who ultimately kill the main boss for various reasons. The story is never developed and you never really understand what is going on. Worst of all, the fighting is terrible. All you have to do is learn your character's most devastating combo and you completely thrash all of your opponents. Also, in between scenes you must wait for loading and the screen has this annoying little skull on it that's moving it's mouth. Maybe I'm just crazy, but it seemed like it was laughing at me becuase I bought this game. Sometimes my eye catches the copy of Barbarian sitting on my shelf, collecting dust and I can hear the skull laughing at me. Seriously people, walk right by this one."
4,Nice Job,"The film had every opportunity to go wrong in at least a 100 ways. But the director refused to go for the cheap effect (what tears there are, are genuine), thus turning this film into something maudlin. The trailer tells you misleadingly that this is a movie about a woman, her sister, and the man they both loved. I guess I missed that last part of the story (and thank God, the director did not dwell on the sensational element in the story). For me the film was about the relationship between two sisters, music, and death. The only criticism I do have is Ms Dupre's passion for music is not adequately covered; and in its place we get her dis-passion for her profession. Had the director confronted the passion aspect, he could have then woven the trilogy of concepts - human relationships, music, and death - into something awfully profound (but then again, perhaps this is something only Shakespeare could have pulled off). Still in this movie the beginning and end meet quite well."
4,"A music lovers delight, MS patients nightmare.","I was a music major in college when I heard that cellist Jacqueline DuPre was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and that she may never play again. About six months later, I got word from a neurologist that I should face the fact that my playing days were over due to the same reason. I can certainly relate to this film.I have read the book and am slightly disappointed with the film version, but I do recommend reading the book first. But please do not deny yourself the pleasure of the music and the excellent performances.A warning to anyone with Multiple Sclerosis: the form of MS portrayed in the film, though accurate in relating to Jacqueline DuPre's case, is extremely rare and happened before currently available treatments. Don't let it scare you, but you will find it interesting that she obviously had symptoms long before anyone suspected the disease."
5,My Favorite Movie,"When I saw this movie with my mother at the movies I was blown away. Seeing what Jackie had to go through with MS hits home for me. I have an aunt and a friend from church who have MS. Watching this movie reminds me of my friend who has MS because she cannot move from the neck down. At the end of the movie when Hilary and her brother are driving home they here on the radio about their sisters death which makes me cry a river of tears. This is my favorite movie. This is a women's movie, but men should see it as well."
3,"Great performance, but....","there is one scene that I think is unappropriate that ruins the whole movie (well, at least from my perspective). That scene is the one when Jackie asks for an unusual favor from her sister Hilary (as Matthew describes below).I think Hilary is stupid and sick to grant Jackie the favor, her husband even more stupid, and Jackie ungrateful.I enjoy the movie up to this point; afterwards I don't see the point of seeing this movie. However, the performances are truly great. If you love classical music and great performances, see this movie. If not, don't bother."

1,The Best of Bondage? Not Really...,"I'm not sure what it is about bondage stories nowadays, but majority of authors in this genre always rely on the same, tired cliche of a woman being dominated by a male boss, lover, husband, stranger, etc., and the even more lackluster and boring cliche of her being spanked, forced to call him ""daddy"" or ""sir,"" and at the end the woman is his slave, not wanting anything more but to be his ultimate sex toy. Now, don't get me wrong, the scenario is hot, but after reading story after story of this same cliche, it starts to become trite and just boring and unimaginative. Most stories in this collection are about this cliche. I think it's quite a shame, since there's more to BDSM than the male being the top and the woman being the bottom. It would be nice if BDSM authors would explore female domination and male submission, and add a bit more imaginative bondage scenes other than the repetitive spanking and ageplay."
3,This one is more a cousin to the Kettle films...,"Absent from this film is Percy Kilbride as Pa Kettle. However, Arthur Hunnicutt plays his brother Sedge rather well (though this raises some plot issues with the Waikiki film). And while Percy may be gone, Charles Lamont directs this one (he directed 3 of the best Kettle films: Further Adventures, Go to Town, and On Vacation), salvaging the film to some degree. This film doesn't have quite the same humor as the other Lamont films, though, and suffers from Pa's abscence. There is the screwball routine wih the bootleggers that carries some of the trademark feel, and Marjorie Main is still in top form...but overall the simple plot and limited cast make this a lesser Kettle title."
1,Yet Another Bad Book from the house of Llewellyn,"The only positive thing that one can say about this book is that it is slightly better than the 21 Lessons of Merlin, by Douglas Monroe.What factual information there is has been buried under nonsense and a poorly disguised veil of Wicca. Please, people, spend money on real materials on the Irish indigenous traditions of filidecht (poet-craft) and folklore rather than wasting time on this.It is fascinating that Kisma can claim to have been an Ollamh (highest level of poet-singer) in the middle 1980's, as the rank of Ollamh required between 12 and 21 years of study under an Ollamh."
1,Not the original Faery Faith,"The orginal faith is not Wiccan. If you would like to read the true information on this faith try Exans-wentz, Caitlin Matthews or RJ Stewart. Deserves a -5"
2,Some good use,"I have owned this book for a few years and I can say that the first half of the book has some great information however as the book slips into the ""magickal"" aspects it starts to loose some of it's ""realism"" and ""believability"""
2,A Major Disappointment,"I Found Kisma Stepanich's book to be a great disappointment. While it contained a lot of interesting reference material, I found Stepanich's attitude off-putting and elitist, and her writing style boring and pedantic. I still use the material contained within, but have rejected the majority of her ideology. The pictures are great, though!"
2,Not Bad,Although much of the book has been taken from other works (as noted by others) it's an easy read and a decent book on the Faery Faith. I would say that Stepanich has just modernised it a bit for those who are interested in the path.
1,"Actually, ZERO STARS!","This books is so bad, for so many reasons that the amount of space I have here to write about them, isn't enough. I'm suspicious as to the origin of the work presented, as the bibliography just doesn't match. It's sad that people have to resort to this half-hearted approach instead of doing the actual research themselves."
2,"a good Wiccan book, but you must delve deeper into the Kelts","while this book is written well with irish and celtic elements framed within Feminist Wiccan thinking, i think we need to delve beyond Wicca to find the roots of Celtic ways. Read Apple Branch by Alexei Kondratiev for a non wiccan approach to celtic ritual. try looking into the lore of the celtic gods written by non wiccans. kisma stepanich has her approach based in wiccan circle magic. wicca is a modern re-write of pagan ways. i am a celt by blood, and feel that you must dig far deeper into the celtic roots of celtic and druid lore to find that the celts were a deep culture not bound to wiccan circle ways. RJ Stuarts Celtic Gods and Celtic Goddesses is a more traditonal view of celtic religion. good book for wiccans to vindicate a celtic version of Wicca. but im a pagan who needs to go a bit deeper than modern Wiccan re-writes to find true Celtic ways. sorry, but that's the truth."
5,Amazing photos and depictions of real life in Victorian Era!,"Loved this text! I actually borrowed a copy from our school library, and was blown away by the information collected by Munby. He obviously had some sort of fetish, but it led to his collection of materials that help us to truly understand the life of working women in Victorian England. This book is very accessible, and the pictures alone are worth a look. You'll see this text featured in the PBS series ""1900 House""."
5,cheap and works!,"it's cheap and it works. nothing to complain about.why pay more for other brands? anyways, i love it. Wee!"
5,Perfect for my motherboard with tons of USB 2.0,Had a motherboard with a bunch po USB 2.0 but my case onlly had 3.0. This did the job. Plenty of USB now to use.
5,Great study guide,I took the Boards in 99 and wish I had had something like this. It is a wonderful review of the elements of Sleep Medicine that we don't use every day but that will likely be on the test. The practice tests are especially helpful.
5,Awesome women's basketball,"The listing says 29.5 inch ball, size 6. When you look up what size 6 means it is actually a 28.5 inch women's regulation size ball. I bought the ball for my son as he plays with a women size ball for his youth league. Since the purchase, I have bought a total of three of these basketballs. The ball has good grip and looks cool. Every kid on my team fight over who gets to use the Adidas balls.It feels, looks and plays like a basketball 3 times the price. I would highly recommend this ball, but do not buy a size 6 thinking it is a men's size 29.5, because it is not."
3,"OK, but not as funny as I'd imagined.","The movie was ok, but I had really expected more out of it because it starred two actors from two of my favorite TV shows (Nip/Tuck & House."
3,It's an okay movie...,"The performances are good...I liked Ewan Proclaimer. The jokes in the movie are sometimes oddly placed and sometimes the flow of the movie gets interrupted, like the bit about the dog turd in the park. It also contains one of those lines I never thought I would ever hear. Rowan Atkinson is probably the best in the film, even though his performance reeks of Blackadder. I suppose that is acceptable here, since this was written by Ben Elton and stars the Honourable Lieutenant George Colthurst St. Barleigh himself."
5,Hugh Laurie at his best.,"I love this cute little comedy movie. I thought Hugh Laurie was absolutely awesome. He is so hilarious and brilliant. One of the best movies I've ever seen him in. He is so good at these kind of comedies. This is just a fantastic movie. I also enjoyed Matthew Macfadyen's charater Nigel. Eventhough his role was small, he was still amazine. He was the reason I bought the movie in the first place, but now that I've watched it I have become a big fan of Hugh Laurie's too."
3,Worth A Look,"""Ordinary Sinner"" is an interesting low budget film which deals with spirutual faith, sexuality, and homophobia in a small town. The cover suggest a bisexual romantic triangle but this is not a just a sexy romp-the film explores complex issues as the role of gays in the church."
5,Yello,"This group should have their own genre. Their music is the best thing i have ever heard. If you haven't heard it, then take a moment to check it out."
1,It didnt help me,After reading the reviews I thought that I would give it a try this book didnt help me at all to me its not well put together.
3,good reference book,The writting is small and it is more of a reference type book that a text book. Good material and helpful.
5,great book,i was looking for a book that would refresh my math skills for college and this book absolutely did that.you have to get used to the format first though. at first it was a little confusing and things didnt seem to flow but after reading it over a couple of times everything started to flow nicely and the math started making sense.so dont give up.
4,Interesting,"Lots of info in here, many dynos and comparisons. Not too sure on the accuracy of some of the claims or the consistency of some of the dynos (ex: testing one part on a ""stock"" car when the dyno shows one with a full array of bolt-ons and/or a supercharger). A good read overall, should help anyone building a Zetec motor."
4,"Good, not great","Spellforce 2 is very unique, and is an effective mix of both RTS and RPG, however, it does neither genre particularly well. My biggest complaint is that all online screenshots look amazing, but even a good computer will have trouble running this game with the graphics settings remotely high....and in this game, there is a big drop off between High and Medium graphics settings. If you have a great cpu setup, you will probably have a good game experience."
1,Ships Without a CD KEY!!,"Be careful - our copy of the game arrived with no CD Key - which is required to install the game. From everything I've seen, this is quite a common problem."
1,More Starforce to bake your computer from Aspyr,"These guys need to wise up and stop putting those drivers in their games. The only thing it hurts is legitimate owners. My last hard drive, Spellforce 1 decided my DVD burner was illegitimate and so started corrupting files; wonderful. Spent 40 bucks for something that ate my computer."
2,Difficult to attach.,Nothing wrong with this bracket if you do not mind the hassle of attaching the binoculars to it. The stem for the bolt which attaches to the binocular is way too short to allow ease of tightening.
1,Highly disappointing LP from a great band,"If you are looking to buy a Manic Street Preachers LP, this is the one to avoid. Most of the Manics' work is solid, but this LP is just dreadful. There are perhaps only one or two worthwhile songs (Sleepflower and Life Becoming a Landslide), but most of it is over-produced and cheesy. Lyrically it is not as brilliant as their other work. It shows a band grabbing at straws to produce their sophomore effort. If you are going to purchase one of their LP's, stick with either ""Generation Terrorists"" or the mighty ""The Holy Bible."""
4,Treasure hunt,Works very well. Light goes from yellow to red once you get within range of the treasure. Halves are hard to separate but there is no reason they have to be kept locked together other than for better storage.
5,Perfect for hide and go seek lovers!,We purchased this for our 5 1/2 year old son and haven't been able to get him to put it away since! We took it to Christmas dinner and he and his four year old friends were kept busy! Great idea!
2,eh,"look at the star rating. the book started interestingly, but didn't follow up. i wish there was more detail about her personal relationships."
2,Ugh,"After about seven chapters, I gave up. I couldn't stand Malory. She was a rude, selfish, and materialistic brat who was so unappealing. I couldn't relate to her at all, and the way she spoke to Flynn...ugh, I just didn't want to read any more. I don't know how he wanted to see her again, other than that she was pretty, which is a stupid reason, because we all know how that works out. Aside from that, this book was just boring. I might read Dana's story though, because she seems like a likable character."
1,"Sorry Nora, I'm a big fan but...","frankly, dear readers, I should warn you...new readers may like it, I found it trite and the most boring Roberts book I have ever read. Sorry to be brutal Nora, sincerely sick of the ""supernatural"" bunk, the three sisters/brothers formula, and you are writing like the hack Steele lately.I know deadlines are a killer--but Nora, what happened to your great imagination??? Go back to re-reading some of your earlier work...you had it right back then. Witches/wizards/faeries/blah blah blah I think.Apparently, you are giving into your publishers??? demand to use the Lord's name in vain...and you see nothing wrong with it Can't you be a little bit more assertive and think of more original phrases???Lj--sorry got the second for Xmas, will read, but do not expect a miracle."
3,"Ok, but she's slipping.","I've always been a HUGE Nora Roberts fan, but in the last few years it seems to me that she's running out of good ideas. Her heavy, heavy reliance on trilogies and bonds of three women is leading to so much repetition. She's also getting a little silly with the fantasy/supernatural angles she's aiming for - they just come across as contrived. The romance angle is still good. She needs to slow down in the publishing rush and take more time crafting original stories. As big a fan as I am, she's no longer on the tip top of my must read list."
1,"Studio says ""no plans""","The reviews below are for the VHS edition. Regarding the DVD, here's a recent e-mail exchange I had with Image Entertainment:MY MESSAGE:Many on-line DVD vendors (including Amazon) have been listing a series called ""Rock Masters"" from your studio for some time now, with confusing information as to release dates. Some of the titles include The Cure, AC/DC, and The Police, and the listings include such details as the song titles. Can you confirm that you have plans to release these DVDs in the future, or can you provide any information at all about these releases?THEIR RESPONSE:Thank you for your inquiry. At this point in time Image Entertainment does not have any plans regarding the release of any titles from the ""Rock Masters"" series on DVD. However, I will pass your email onto our acquisitions department which will look into the possibility of releasing these titles on DVD at some point in the future.Thank you."
4,Good Show,"Good show ,but you can wait forever for the release or buy it on the amazon-japan site. Which I did. Patience is a virtue?get real,just buy it on the japanese site, good luck,rock n roll"
4,Poor Quality but Entertaining,"At first I didn't like the video very much because it was fairly poor quality. However, my four year old son loves it! And, it is a fun way to see all the trucks he loves in action."
3,"Better than some, far from ideal","Well, it does have 20 trucks, and gets right to the point. There's no extraneous shots of non-truck things while your toddler is anxiously awaiting the good parts. Each truck gets a few minutes of solo coverage at a time.On the down side, the narration is comically bland. The video quality ranges from OK to very poor. It's all trucks - no excavators or front-loaders. The scene selection menu is a case study in misguided UI."
1,Horrible- not worth it,"My son loves trucks and tractors, so I thought this video would be great- it is absolutely unbearable. The only thing redeeming about it is a cute song- naming twenty different trucks. After the song, the video goes through each truck more in-depth. This would be alright except the two ""voices"" discussing the trucks are grown women trying to sound like little girls (complete with ""giggles"")- the result is just the most annoying, high pitched, nasally sound that is so bad, I find it intolerable. There is nothing in the video that is worth this suffering- just buy ""I Dig Dirt"" (it too features girls and women- if you're looking for a video for little girls about trucks) and/or ""Real Wheels; Truck Adventures (Tractor, Dump Truck and Farm Truck)"" and your child will have seen twenty trucks, learned a cute song, and you'll still be sane."
2,Oversimplified by haredi views,"Large book on history of Jerusalem but the author's strong haredi views impact what he writes and what he does not write. This is especially evident towards the end of the book which speaks about Jerusalem after 1948. As all haredi history writing does, it oversimplifies things to fit into its worldview. Could use more information on Rabbi Akiva Yosef Schlesinger. Also the cutesy anecdotes between chapters is quite corny."
5,Looks great,"Trans Dapt always makes nice little dress up things for my car. I ordered this on Monday, got it on Wednesday. Put it on the car and it looks and works just as it should."
4,"Worth watching again, but with moderation","I liked this book, but I generally like historical novels. It is a “who done it’ with a medieval setting. It shows some the hypocrisy of the church of the day and of inquisitions."
3,Respect other people's opinions,"Look, the movie has its good points, but it also has its bad. If you feel your opinion should be heard, don't be an insecure loser and pick on someone else for theirs. As for the person who who had a morality issue with this movie: respect that and stick to your opinion, instead of attacking someone elses.If you like suspense and the thriller/horror feel, you may like it. Sean Connery is fun to watch in any movie, and if you are a fan of his then that is a reason to watch. Same goes if you are a Slater fan.It is dark and, at moments, very graphic, but if you don't mind that in movies, go ahead and watch. If not, then move on.Ultimately,I suggest you rent it first before deciding to buy it."
3,Midieval Drama,"This is a midieval drama about monks. It is a good movie. You can get VHS tapes for 1 or 1.50 now so you don't have to worry about the cost any more. They made them cheap enough for everyone to be able to afford. When VHS tapes, a TV and VCR were a luxury, those were the days when in an R rated movie big stars would get nude like every time. The high class went out the door, much the same as Martin Luther with books in the 1500s. Sweden's official religion is Lutheran; Martin Luther made books cheap enough for everyone to be able to afford. King James was the first modern King in Europe who wanted everyone to know the gospel, but they still won't shell out 5 or 6 bucks to get the Authorized King James Bible. It's amazing. This movie is about monks from that period, about the 1500s, late 1400s."
1,The name of the rose,"Movie is good ,the transfer is poor . Or maybe it's just my copy that is faulty.it starts and stops I think I am too late for an exchange"
2,Big disappointment,"I'm a Lance Armstrong fan and LOVED ""It's Not About the Bike."" This book, however, seemed more a vehicle for self promotion and bank account enhancement. The story line was disjointed, making it seem as if the book was thrown together in a few days without much editorial oversight. Having loved his first book so much, this one really disappointed."
3,An off-the-cuff-style retrospective,"This book won't win any literary awards but its an entertaining read. Lance gives his first person account of what life has been like for him since attaining his dual icon status as cancer surviver and multiple Tour de France winner. If your a fan and you've kept up with him throughout his cycling career then you'll enjoy the glimpse into the chaos thats behind his machine-like rides. Its light reading and will be most appreciated by his fans. This is not a continuation of ""It's Not About The Bike"". The theme's from his first book are visited but only with their relevance to his life since his first Tour de France victory."
1,"don't bother, this is an insult to fans","The other review is right on, but I felt there needed to be more than one review to better convince people.All modern-made Looney Tunes cartoons are awful. They feature none of the elements that made the others classic: uninspired voice-acting, poor comedic timing, little originality, and decent-at-best animation. In other words, no Mel Blanc, no Chuck Jones, and no Carl Stalling. Check out theLooney Tunes - Golden Collectionseries instead. Those are guaranteed to satisfy.Please do not support the continued production of cruddy cartoons."
2,Simple Minds Debut Looks To Their Influences,"Debut album shows the greatest amount of influence for this long-running Scot band. Be Bop Deluxe and especially Doctors Of Madness figure high in the mix with a little Sparks showing up as well. ""Chelsea Girl"" and ""Sad Affair"" stick out like a big fat 1960's hits that never were, but elsewhere the mood is dark and serious. Think early Cure. This gives only a little hint of the brilliance that will soon erupt for this band, but not bad for a first time out."
1,What is that hair on the side of jackie's face?,"stupid and dull, dont buy this or rent, u should watch the tellatubies instead."
3,WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM,"I ordered two of these to replace 2 I had gotten from Home Depot but could no longer find. I was so excited to see them on Amazon. Both of them arrived damaged with banged in edges on the lids. The box was flimsy with just paper packing (very Unlike Amazon's normal packaging). I requested replacement of both. Was sent one which was fine despite crappy packing again, but the second one sent as a separate shipment had a chipped seat edge again (in another crappy pack job). I requested another replacement, but was told I could only get a refund for the last one that was damaged since they're having problems getting them to me undamaged. Amazon gets a ""5"" for customer service as always, but it was disappointing. All they had to do was wrap these in the big bubble wrap for protection...problem solved!"
1,Very Dissappointed,"I am a builder who was looking for ideas on cottage decore for sea shore homes. This book would be more aptly titled ""Modern Architecture by the Sea"". The homes featured in this book had nothing to do with most peoples' preconceived ideas of what a ""cottage"" looks like. I am returning the book for a refund."
1,Tanakh: English only,"No returnsFrom the photo of the Tanakh On amazon.com this book does not resemble, nor entail the correct information, Hebrew-English.I'm not @ all pleased with this product or professionalism & will not purchase from the seller or any other 3rd party book proprieter again"
3,Very effective quasi-pornographic film.,Very interesting introduction to the work of Russ Meyer. His personal obsessions are quite evident in the movie. Erotic sequences fit well into the given context.
2,badly written,"THis could could have been much better. The authors, who interviewd Hartmann personally, failed to impress the readers with the authentic life in the Luftwaffe. they make us feel that should be so easy to take off and shoot down hundreds of ignorant Russian fighter pilots ..."
4,A good ND game,Replayed it twice so far. A good game. Only hard part was analyzing specimens. Guess that's what walkthroughs are for. LOL
3,"Fun at first, but a disappointment","This Nancy Drew game started out fun, and it was pretty good until the ending, which I think was the absolute worst ending in the whole series. There was nothing scary or clever about it, and it came much too quickly. Everything up until the ending was pretty fun, though... I was expecting it to be bad because of other reviews about it, but really the only horrible thing was the ending. If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game that shows HerInteractive at their best, I would suggest Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake or Secret of Shadow Ranch. I had fun with this one, but I do have all the other Nancy Drew games."
2,Why bother? No comparison to other Nancy Drew games.,"I was very disappointed with this game I have all but ""Danger By Design"" and this one I could have done without. There were no real puzzles in this game. You mostly ran around completing tasks for people. I gave it two stars for: the new GPS map, the cell phone switch, and the scenery. But as for the actual game play I give it 1 star."
2,The worst in Nancy Drew series,The only thing I liked is the character switch feature. The game is too short and easy. I'm really disappointed. Hope the next one will improve.
3,One of the Weaker Nancy Drew Games,"I've played all of the Nancy Drew games, and this is one of the weaker ones. This case has Nancy travelling to Hawaii along with the Hardy Boys, who will help her solve the case. Nancy is on assignment helping a bug scientist in the jungle (no joke- not quite my idea of a Hawaiian vacation). The Hardy Boys, meanwhile, are staying at a resort where people are required to complete ridiculous tasks to ""earn"" privileges. Expect to string plenty of necklaces. Again, who goes to that kind of resort?In any case, the graphics in this game are beautiful- expect some gorgeous paradise beaches. The game's story is weak, however, and the game is very short. Much shorter, I thought, than the other Nancy Drew games. The game is still worth playing, but don't expect the amount or quality of gameplay as in the others."
3,Disappointingly Brief - but the Hardy Boys Were Fun,"I admit it... I'm a 40 year old addict to the Nancy Drew games. It s a great ""retro"" escape from work related woes and I special ordered this game to occupy my whole weekend and distract me. To my dismay, the whole game was completed by 1:30 p.m. on Saturday. And that included a lot of extra fishing and bead stringing that was not relevant to the game progress. I loved the addition of the Hardy Boys (always had a crush on them) but that did not make up for the utter lack of puzzling puzzles. I didn't even have to web surf to a cheat to get past the ONE major task. On the whole the game was not up to the standards of the previous ones."
2,Interesting Points of Veiw but continues to go downhill,I found this game really ineteresting in the fact that you go to play both Nany and the Hardy Boys... with a phone call you trade places and play as the other... Other then that the game like many of the other recent ones have fallen short... Seems like each game has slowly gotten short and ended more abruptly... Honestly I think they have to start putting more thought into these games not just trying to get them out as fast possible... The ideas they have are good... but they have exacuted them very well lately... Hoping the new game does not fall short like the rest
3,"Way too Short, Way too Easy","This game was way too short and way too easy, I wish they would stop trying to mass produce instead of Quality produce."
3,The Warriors by Sol Yurick,"it was what i expected and i read a lot about the book on wikipedia, so i knew what i was getting into. in my honest opinion, the book was pretty good and captured the feel and vibe of the time, it was violent but not in the flashy way the movie is. you should also know this, though the book and movie share the same title and a few similarities, they are not the same, by a longshot. don't expect to get the movie in written form or you'll be greatly disappointed."
2,"Not quite what I expected, relating with the film","The film was excellent. Brilliantly shot, produced, cast. Then I got excited about owning my own copy of Yurick's gang-life masterpiece, for reading enjoyment. What a huge disappointment. Naturally all the gang names, personalities, and events are changed here. None of the names, faces, or climaxes are similar with the film. And the novel mentions an 'older' veteran gang member [originally titled the Coney Island Destroyers], who is nowhere mentioned in the movie. And much of the action doesn't match the film either.Perhaps that's exactly WHY director Hill deliberately captioned in the films' opening credits ""based"" on the novel. Not DIRECTLY QUOTED from the novel. For die-hard movie, including 'Warriors' fans, you may turn out disappointed like I was.Still, the novel is worth owning, alongside the DVD mainly for show and sentiment. However, the film was at least masterful.PEANUT"
5,Siren of Time Machine,"She's a nice retro chick giving off a vibe with her cool 60-70-ish folk rock of a past era that is deeply reassuring to those of us in our 30s and 40s who are starting to worry about time. Listening to music like this sends out a reassuring subconscious message that we are not getting old, even though we are. We the audience are the Herethereafter, i.e. we are Here, that is the in the present after being There, which means the past."
3,Beautiful voice and great music,"I had no idea who Miranda Lee Richards was until I was browsing through amazon.com, trying to find some new singers. As usual, I didn't think much of the song clips I heard but I changed my mind when I heard ""Ella"", which is amazingly beautiful. The song ""Seven Hours"" is also amazing, with great guitar work. Miranda has a beautiful and soothing voice and this album definately showcases her voice perfectly. Check her out!"
1,Binge and Purge,"Musical Excrement. The cover of ""Dandelion"" sounds like it was sung by an Alanis Morrisette clone. This unsoulful album has about as much integrity as the entire Lillith Fair line-up. Buy the Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions album instead."
1,Mayfair - pay for what you get,What you get is cheap. It will only last a couple month before it develops a tear and you have to replace it again.
3,Left wanting....,"It was good to see Jack Canfield do his thing, but it was more of an intro for the ""real"" show which is not included in this video. Would not purchase again - learned nothing new and it was a very superficial overview."
5,"It's not just ""environmental"" ethics...","This book provides an extraordinary place for any individual looking to understand and hone their ethics and values, it just happens to use environmental issues as its context. The editorial comments are concise and probing, and the illustrative articles and essays are classic and thought provoking. Although the reading is generally a bit dense for page turning on one's way to bed, that's even viable for individuals looking for a bit of intensity prior to sleep. An excellent, well rounded, exploration into earth's environment and human roles and perceptions regarding it."
5,A Complete Poetic Phenomenology,"Not just brilliant, not just sensual, Moira Egan's ""Cleave"" is the rare art through which words express something seemingly inexpressable. Beyond mere categories, beyond mere emotions, she captures experience itself, by turns glorious, bland, and miserable. And this conclusion I reached before I even reflected on the collection's structure, a helix of the semantic idiosyncrasies that a single word is capable of serving up to us. As Moira Egan puts it in her poem ""Love & Death,"" ""How else to express the brazen philosophy, the teleology of flesh beyond love, the ontology of sex that can lead to death?""In case you couldn't tell, I liked it--a lot."
5,A book that changed my life!,"This heartfelt documentary about Rachel Scott inspired me so much. It makes you sit back and realize what life's really about. I was fortunate enough to hear Darrell Scott speak prior to reading this - and it restated a lot about what he said. Rachel's spiritual life is an incredible testimony. The book also contains a lot about information the media does not tell you. Like the killers were intending to kill Christians and had planned this for months, even videoing themselves months before the murders. I could not put this book down - if you believe in God - Rachel's story will impact your life and hopefully your relationship with Christ!"
4,A challenge for teens ... and adults.,"As a parent, this book is very hard to read. Beth and Darrell share their heartbreak in words that help others feel it. The words of Rachel Joy Scott appearing on paper are at the same time shocking to see -- some show the hole where a bullet passed -- and comforting to read. Each one holds a challenge out to the reader. A challenge to go deeper into one's understanding of God. The ""story"" she wrote about the gloves of conviction is one that can be applied to every believer and should be considered. I'm grateful to Rachel's parents for sharing their daughter this way.I recommend this book to every teen, girls especially. I think every youth minister and parent should digest the lessons taught within the pages. The parents here don't try to sell their daughter as the perfect child, but they do share her heart via her journals, allowing us to see the girl as she was. Impacting. Insightful. Challenging."
1,Horrible,"I read the whole entire book, and it was nothing great at all.I recommend you DONT read this book. It is definitely overrated."
4,Delightful.,"Gus Lee's 'China Boy' was on my school's book club list this year. It was the first book I read from the list, and I must say that it was a delight to read.This book tells the tale of an American-born Chinese boy.Kai Ting is frail, skinny, and pale as can be.And he is tired of being beat up by bullies.So guess what? He joins the local YMCA for some boxing lessons!This book has emotion, action, and some laughs here and there. It is a book about a boy who is struggling between two cultures. And it is just outright fun to read.Gus Lee's writing is unique, eloquent, and beautiful--one of the best.After reading about Kai Tings adventures, the reader can't help but simply love the books ending, which is funny and emotional. A very entertaining book."
2,page after page of unformed anecdotes,"CHINA BOY was indistinguishable from the tourist pamphlets handed out to non-chinese ""visitors"" to the chinese community of san francisco. It relied too heavily on ""educating"" the reader on the ""authentic"" ways of the Chinese and was sorely lacking in the form of storytelling. The countless anecdotes just kept piling on, as if the sheer number of pages was enough to ""become"" a novel. Utterly unsatisfying and predictable in its reliance on the stereotypical characterizations and descriptions."
4,The Best of The Best by Salvador Bueno P2/R2,"China Boy is mostly about a boy named Kai Ting. When his mother and sisters came from China becuase of war, Kai was born. After a while his mother died fom cancer and his father married a white lady named Edna. Edna thought Kai was spoiled to much so she put him outside. Kai had troubles in the inside and outside world. He would always get into fights and get hurt, but noone would care. The only friend that cared was Toos. He now has to deal with both worlds. This book is really good and has an interesting plot. It helps with a lot of emotions. It is a little bit hard to read but you'll get through it."
4,Not the usual L'Amour,"I was not as fond of this L'Amour book. It was written about a family and how they interacted throughout many years during the settling of the west. I found it hard to follow the storyline because there were too many names to try to keep up with. I know the title is very well known and popular, but I thought it could have been written better. Parts of the book were interesting despite the fact that some of the book was hard to follow. So, I'd recommend you read the book, but take your time and be sure you keep up with everything that's going on."
4,It is HUGE!,"First off, im 5'6 and this comes up to my chest, not only is it tall, but its long and wide as well. The material seems durable to me. And just to let you know, the legs may need a little extra time to get air in them, we couldnt figure out why the body of it was on the verge of exploding, but the legs werent blowing up-it was because the hole that leads the air into the legs must not be very big--so just give them time to fill up, so you dont burst the dino."
1,Super cool to look at..but came w. a leak :(,"My son loves this, but it arrived w. a giant leak, so I have a very sad 4 yr old :("
1,Yeeesh!!!!,"Dialog written by an 11 year old, basically, you'd have to be a complete chump to enjoy this ""dog"". You'd be better entertained stabbing yourself with a fork."
1,Seam split 12 days after it was installed....,"Seam split 12 days after it was installed....NOT RECOMMENDED! Mayfair 113CP Soft Toilet Seat with Chrome Hinges, Elongated, White Vinyl"
3,Death By Toaster (And So Much More)...,"SHRIEK OF THE MUTILATED concerns a group of yeti-hunters led by professor Prell. This zero-budget schlocker has it's moments, especially the hilarious breadknife / toaster-in-the-tub sequence, and the ""shock"" ending! Of course, this mostly looks like someone's home movie, and some things that may have been outrageous 30+ years ago are pretty funny now! I've heard SOTM touted as being in the same league as TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Um, no. Still, it is enjoyable enough if you're in the mood for some cheese..."
5,Galactically Great!,"If the $200+ price tag on this CD seems extreme, believe me, it's worth it if you are a fan of innovative jazz orchestra. I was privilaged to be living in Japan back in the late '70s when this album debuted, and I was amazed by it. There is nothing to compare today with The Inner Galaxy Orchestra, but imagine charts as complex and intriguing as those by the likes of Ebherhard Weber or Bobo Stenson, with the added benefit of a strident female lead vocalist. This is an excellent display of the lost art of 70s-era Japanese jazz fusion, and harkens back to those salad days of 'Nabe Sadao, Honda Takehiro, Sato Masahiko, ITS, and Native Son. Do yourself a big favor and spring for this CD. There is simply nothing like it."
1,Vulgarity brought to the extreme.,"I write this review mainly because the current ""average customer review"" doesn't reflect the level of this movie and doesn't give the potential buyer a fair and balanced assessment about the quality of this film.It is a colossal disaster. This motion picture redefines the phrase ""a complete waste of time""; you just can't waste your time any better than you can waste it if you watch this film.Suffice it to say that after this film is over you will want to take a part in an anger management therapy group yourself, if only to vend all the rage and anxiety this film has created in you. The primary target of the writers is to stretch the nerves of the film's viewers to the point in which they will understand how it is to totally ""lose it"". I can give it to them - they've made it for me. Would you like to be another successful case in their disturbing experience?"
2,Does Jack need money?,"Heres' the problem: this film simply isn't funny. Worse, it's obvious that Nicholson KNOWS it isn't funny. It was painful, at least for me, to watch him, in what appears to be a self parody, trying bravely to bail while this ship sinks -- and fast. Ugh!"
1,"possibly the worst ""comedy"" in a decade.",I could only watch 30 minutes of this mess. As funny as a car wreck and the most contrived set-up I've ever seen.
1,Awful,This should have been a great movie...I thought it could be...Oh was I wrong! Just awful. Unfunny. The acting is atrocious. Terrible writing. A completely ridiculous ending. Too many cameos. Gets one star only for Woody Harrelson's funny bit in the film. Otherwise rent this first or save your money for something else altogether.
5,Cool,"This item was just as described. It was ""used"" but in good condition. This movie is too funny. I got it for my husband and I think he will enjoy it! (^_^) The price was reasonable and the shipping was fast."
5,wickedly funny,"adam sandler & jack nicholson can't get any funnier than this, this movie is so funny that it'll have you lauhing until you cry. this is a good movie."
2,Really stupid,This is the stupidest movie I've seen in a long time and I think it may be one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. It's (with the exception of Nicholson) really not funny at all and it just seems to go on too long without going anywhere or doing anything. The ending was also awful. Are we really supposed to believe that Sandler would want to marry his girlfriend after she put him through all that? Don't buy this movie. Rent it once if you have nothing better to do and you're going to get drunk or something while you watch it.
2,JUST NOT FUNNY!!!!!,This movie was very highly anticipated and was number one at the box office and but I just didn't think it was funny at all. Is this a comedy? I just can't remember one funny moment?!?!?!?
1,REALLY Disappointing,"Every good scene was shown in the commercials. It was sophomoric, cliche, crude and poorly directed.I really couldn't believe that individual talents like Tomei, Sandler and Nicholson couldn't pull off something better than this.I'd hate to think that Rudy Guiliani read the entire script before he agreed to have a cameo."
5,Anger Management is Hilarious,"I thought Anger Management was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I had to post this review because I could not believe the average rating it got was 3 stars. The people who gave this movie a bad review must have a very different sense of humor than I. At least give this movie a chance, if you're an intelligent person you'll love it."
2,Not as bad as I expected,"Sandler and Nicholson together. What more do you need to know. Still, I was surprised that it was, after all, an OK movie. But then it wasn't a typical Adam Sandler film. That's probably why everyone else I know hated it."
5,purchased not borrowed,"I borrow alot of books from the local quilt guild- this one included. But then I had to purchase it..., too many things i NEEDED to keep!"
4,Where was the editor?,"Yet another good book spoiled by lousy editing.1. Russians do not have middle names. It should be Andrey Dmitrievich Sakharov, or A.D. Sakharov, or Andrey Sakharov, but NOT Andrey D. Sakharov.2. There are A LOT of mistakes in spelling of Russian names and book titles.3. In two Greek words (allegedly by Plato), chresimos pseudos, I found 3 (THREE) errors: there are no zetas it those words at all, only sigmas.4. By the time of Versailles Treaty, Romania had been on the map of Europe for about 50 years; it had not been created as a result of that treaty . . .etc., etc., etc.I do not believe Professor Weeks doesn't know when Romania was created. I blame copyeditor and proofreader . . . if there were any."
1,Seller is a crook,"I guess I should have read the other reviews, Guys a crooks shows a whole kit all you get is the driver, no tip holder, no bits, no case. ( RIPP OFF !!!! ) Guess i'll go back to E-Bay they would have pulled this guy along time ago and wouldn't have let him continue ripping honest people off. DONT BUY FROM THIS SCAMMER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lisle 29000 3/8"" Hand Impact Tool"
1,Item Received Was Not As Described,"I'm usually pretty trusting when I see that Amazon.com is the seller. This habit failed me, however, as I neglected to read the reviews stating that the item was the driver only, with no 3/8"" bit holder or case (as pictured). As the other reviews state, this product will not be as you see pictured on the product page."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"I purchased this product to help me get to sleep. It does make me a bit drowsy after about 20-30 minutes, but nothing I couldn't stay awake through. So, it isn't as effective as I had hoped. I will continue to take it until gone, but most likely won't reorder."
2,Worked faster than capsules but tiny bottle and tolerance builds quick,"Worked for a week then had to keep adding more and more. This tiny bottle didnt last long, not worth the money and time to count drops."
1,Be Cautious...,"This product induced severe memory lapses and black outs. After having tests run by a few doctors, it was determined that this herbal product did, in fact, cause me to experience memory loses, lapses in what memories I did have, and enabled me to do things during what seemed to be a period of 'black-outs.' Be very cautious before buying this, discuss with a physician, first!"
5,The BEST!,Why am I having such a difficult time finding these tasty treats? A great snack when you need a sweet!
1,"To Those Who Defend Elvis, his songs, and His Sideburns","Hey! Get a life and a touch of sophistication. The only cultural revolution an illiterate hick like Presley initiated was the lowering of aesthetic values and good taste. He did, however, have the largest belly and silliest costumes of all popular singers. Now why don't you go out, grab a six pack and listen to something more sophisticated than Presley....perhaps Alvin and the Chipmunks. Thank you'll...thank you'll very much...huh, huh, huh....now where's the fried chicken?"
1,Absolutely the worst picture I wasted my time seeing this year!,"I wanted to just add to what others have said, AND I repeat. ""This is the worst picture I have ever seen, EVER!"" Not only was it a bad sequel, but it set back Sci-Fi a 100 years."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever!!!,"This movie is so bad that its a joke. I got it for really cheap, and I liked the first movie, so I gave it a shot. Wow! Is this movie bad. Really, it may be the cheesiest movie of all time. Ghetto special effects, second-rate actors, horrible plot, just an all around cheese-fest. Don't waste your time unless you want to laugh at how bad it is. Get the original, the first movie is a classic. This is just a cheap straight-to-DVD cash-in."
1,Makes No Sense,"If I could give this movie less than 1 star, I would.The central character, Ryan, played by Jason Scott Lee (by the way, what happened to the Muscles from Brussels?), is a loser. Why? Because HE SAVES ADOLF HITLER'S LIFE!!! And how does he do this? By killing the leading lady.Gee, great script guys.Also, the thing makes no sense. People are obliterated from history, and Ryan knows about it! Hello, if they were removed from history, he would have no memory of them. Duh!If there was such a thing as a 'Time Cop', they would outlaw people wasting 2hrs watching this ridiculous movie!"
4,it's pretty good,"the first movie was based on a corrupt politician trying to change the past so he can become president. this movie is based on what would happen if a person goes back in time to change improtant historical events. it's moral vs. logic. jason scott lee's jeet kune do action sequences are up to par. meaning, jeet kune do is more on the lines of street fighting. you're not going to see any flipping or flying this movie. thank goodness. the rest of the cast could be changed with better actors. yea, this movie was dvd release only but is a pretty good movie to watch. if you're a hardcore van damme fan, then don't get it but if you don't give a hoot and want to watch a time traveling martial arts movie with second grade acting but with an interesting story bethind it, then get it. i would."
4,Good action Sci-Fi,"Not as entertaining as Time Cop I with Van Dammn ,but it still stands on it`s own as a good action Sci-Fi movie.Jason Scoot Lee does a great job as the time cop.I got my copy from Amazon seller ""I Feel So Used Books"" who went above and beyond the call of duty when I had trouble with the first DVD I ordered."
2,Fanciful,"The latest manifestation of my obsession with PKD ends in disappointment. The author seems to care more about pretentious writing and fanciful extrapolations of events in his subject's life, rather than responsibly unravelling the man and his madness. To be sure, there's some fairly solid biographical info in places, but the amount of ponderous crap I had to wade through to get to it left me very unsatisfied."
1,"Difficult, flimsy","These training wheels were VERY difficult to install, and after all that work, rattle. Not like our past experiences with training wheels. Time will tell if they hold up."
5,Great customer service,The training wheels came on time and product quality is as promised. They're sturdy and work great! I look forward to watching my granddaughter having many hours of fun.
2,You want the other model,"I maintain a fleet of about 35 kids bikes for my wife's daycare business. She get donations of mostly of cheap department store kids bikes. The most often broken part is the training wheels. So, I have bought and installed lots of replacement training wheels over the years.You really want the model with the `sturrip' that goes forward and fits over the chainstay. That keeps the training wheel from flipping back and upward when the kid puts weight on it. Wald makes many durable models with this feature. Go buy one of those."
2,"Great concept, horribly drawn out","I do like the characters and the concepts put forth in this book, but if you're looking for a little less talk and a lot more action, DON'T get this book. It was so long-winded, I didn't even get past the first 150 pages! If you're an impatient reader, search elsewhere for something to read."
5,Good seat,"We've had these for a over a year now, to replace the cheap plastic ones that came with our new toilets. They are still in great shape, clean up well and stay tightly attached. No complaints at all."
4,Not bad,"Just got mine and install it, the nut is a little hard to fit in to the toilet's holes, and the washer got squeeze out after you tight it up. but over all a well made toilet seat cover. thick paint job and seems to hold togther well. hope the chrome on the Hinges will hold up not like the other reviews said."
2,"Cheap construction, weird noises","I really liked this pad at FIRST. It was quiet and really seemed to help my laptop keep cool. But after a few months, the cheapish construction started to break. Four of the fan ""arms"" on the right fan have broken off and the left fan now regularly makes a VERY loud whirling noise that it never made before. Turning the pad on and off will usually stop this noise, but the slightest shift in position or angle of the pad will start it up again. Also, I sit with the lap top actually on my lap... and I have to sit with my legs slightly set apart so that the fans can properly ventilate underneath. All in all, an okay product... but next time I will try to find a pad with higher quality construction. This one is just breaking down way too quickly and growing more annoying every day."
1,Junk!,"A good friend gave this to me for my birthday. When it worked, it was very refreshing. But, the cord connection on the unit is poor and within a month I had to stretch the cord just right or it wouldn't work. It completely quit after two months. I'm here looking for something other than the Targus. It's plastic junk!"
3,Targus Notebook Cooling Chill Mat,"Great for chillin', but the additional usb hub doesn't work at all. Selected this one because I saw it paired to HP Pavilion dv7. Not a good size for that laptop, the laptop has a 17.3 monitor and it dwarfs the Chill Mat. Way to small, to small to keep your lap cooled off while using the laptop.But again on a desk it keeps the laptop cooled off fine. Also you have to use an electric adapter and I would have preferred that the power source would be from the laptop. Having to drag an additional adapter around is a drag. I would have returned it but I waited to late to take it out of the box and test the usb hub."
3,Still not the charm,"My first Targus chill mat(PA248U) didn't last long, as the construction didn't hold up -- somehow the fans both got chipped, and eventually quit working less than 6 months after purchase. That model also had an unnecessarily long USB cord. HOWEVER, THAT model was at least nice and quiet! This chill mat is has much sturdier construction, and the USB cord is shorter! BUT..... the noise from this thing discourages me from turning it on until my laptop is kicking its own fan on high speed. The whirr isn't even steady and thus is very hard to tune out. Maybe the 3rd model I try will be the charm and have all 3 features in one unit...UPDATE: THE CHILL PAD DIED AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS OF NORMAL USE (NOT ROUGH HANDLING, JUST MOVED AROUND WITHIN THE HOUSE.) DISAPPOINTING."
4,labtop cooling fan,it works well for me and is very light. will take a couple falls without breaking.
4,Good but noisy,The Chill Mat does exactly what it is supposed to do: keep the laptop cool.My only complaint is that these coolers are generally noisy. My friend has a different cooler but it is just as noisy. Maybe notebooks are not meant to replace desktops.
5,Oops!...He Did It Again,"John Williams has crafted another musical masterpiece. I can hardly wait for the new Harry Potter movie now.Oooh, my appetite has been wet..."
4,A must have...,"if you collect soundtracks. I personally loved this score. I thought it was brilliant in way possible and it's all I want to listen too.However, I was a little disappointed with the order on the album it's self. For instance, ""Bucbeak's Flight"" is a whole five tracks before ""Hagrid the Professor."" I may just be being picky, but I usually like it when a soundtrack mirrors the film.Either way, if you are a fan of the series, you'll really enjoy this."
2,good natured but sophomoric and pretentious,"Suib's prose reads like he learned to write from a J. Peterman's catalogue. He's wordy,pretentious, but likeable. Would be great writing for a high school English student's assignment on travel writing."
2,Not Really Good...But Definitely Not the Worst,"I recently watched this movie with my young niece and nephew. They like Elvis but most of his movies are pretty hard to take. To keep them occupied, I told them that Elvis never left Hollywood to make this movie so they needed to spot the real Elvis shots and the other location shots that featured a double. It worked. Between songs, they had fun picking out the real locations from the bad rear-projection shots of Elvis.""Bossa Nova Baby"" is the only real song worth anything (like ""Return to Sender"" was the only real song in GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!). The rest all sound like bad Mexican tunes about bulls or bullfighters. Ursula Andress is hot but she's a long way away from Honey Rider in DR. NO.The best of Elvis's post-Army movies was VIVA LAS VEGAS and the worst--and there are a lot of them--would be HARUM SCARUM. FUN IN ACAPULCO would fall directly in the middle."
5,Fun in Alcapulco,I enjoyed this movie very much because I am a fan of Elvis and I enjoy the old movies. This is one of my favorites of his.
4,spotty queen is still great,"Jazz has some of Queen's very best efforts: the remarkably upbeat ""Don't stop me now,"" the winsome folk rock of ""Leaving home ain't easy,"" and the typically great Deacon pop-rocker ""If you can't beat 'em,"" but also some real clinkers like the poorly structured ""Bicycle Race,"" and the obnoxious ""Let me entertain you."" A mixed bag, but it's Queen, so there is always more going than most bands can squeeze out of an entire career."
1,Bring back the old Queen!,"Jazz is one of my least favorite Queen CD's. Besides Mustapha and Don't Stop Me Now, this album is to be avoided at all costs."
5,Worth Consideration,"In general, John Stossel has made my blood boil. But his arguments are persuasive, and one needs to take a second look. He is right in taking a closer look at established beliefs and policies. He takes a libertarian point of view, but comes at it from a non-ideological stance. However, question his conclusions. His illustrative examples usually comprise vignettes of people actually living / experiencing the issue. He is against funding of public television, (before the Big-Bird controversy of the first 2012 presidential debate), however if we let public programming become self-supporting, are we eliminating the only show that omits / minimizes commercial advertisements? The subsidy of non-productive land is another interesting topic he covers. Interesting his comments on how the liberal vs. conservative media is shutting him out, and the only one to listen was Sean Hannity (an arch conservative). Maybe we need to consider a third, fourth and fifth view, and this is one of them."
4,A surprise read,"From ABC's 20/20The book surprised me and was hard to put down. He talks about his beginnings. As being considered heroic. And now after his book a scourge and a threat. John gives us what he has really uncovered. Better than the show. But John, why did you except the insurance money for your beach home?"
1,Pompus,"John Stossel should go to work for the Fox News channel because this book, and his short stories on 20/20 only give out the information he chooses to give out and never tell the complete story. It is hypocritical to criticize the ""liberal media"" when he IS the media! If he doesn't like the media then he doesn't like himself. I saw him on Bill O'Reilly. It was like John's ""coming out"" party as a conservative. It was as if O'Reilly was Satan and Stossel was signing his soul over. He looked very ashamed and he should be. The guy is a goof ball."
3,Stossel goes beyond typical right-wing claptrap,"Even if you disagree with Stossel's libertarian viewpoints, it is refreshing to see someone from a non-mainstream ideological spectrum get as much air-time and ink as Stossel. Stossel doesn't just go after the typical liberal TV straw men (though he does a fair amount of that), he also goes after big business leaders and other fat cats who rarely get questioned by American media."
2,Give Me a Reference,"This book was a quick and interesting read. It was thought-provoking and I appreciated what Stossel had to say on a variety of topics. There were only a few spelling and grammatical errors.My problem with this book is that Stossel backs up only some of what he says. He provides good rationale for some of his arguments, but sweeps through many of them. For instance, he thinks the FDA should be disbanded, but devotes only one paragraph to explaining why.There are no endnotes and footnotes. One of his tables had no scale on the Y axis! There is no way to check his facts; we're supposed to trust everything he says. It's ironic that an investigative reporter would expect his readers to mindlessly accept his position on so many crucial issues.If you choose to read this book, look forward to being exposed to some valuable insight and ideas. But put on your critical thinking cap first."
2,"If he couldn't beat them, he joined them.","First he says he cracked down on all those ""liberals"" but yet he admits to loving their evil ways. If this is as wishy washy as he can get, no wonder he and Sam Donaldson get along ! You can't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same ""liberal media"". If he were working as a farmer in Idaho for instance, he'd have more credibility but I'm not so sure Stossel says what he means."
2,noodle & doodle,"I was excited to find this selection on Amazon and I ordered it right away. I think Les Paul is a national treasure and Chet Atkins is no slouch either. The music was a great disappointment. It sounds like they just sat down for the first time with no preparation and that each played gingerly for fear of outdoing the other guy. They succeeded so well that, in my opinion, the result is thoroughly weak. I also have very little use for the ""Boys Club"" style comments before during and after some of the numbers. This selection should be marketed as the informal practice session that it is. Normally, I complain about cd's offering significantly less than an hour of music. Here it's a relief."
5,Classic meeting of the Greatest!,"If you don't get any other Chet and/or Les album/CD's, get this one.It's a wonderful chance to hear two of the greatest electric guitarists together. The vastly different styles of these two are a perfect blend, and the meeting of two old pros is classic. It's a lot of fun and great music.I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
3,Early look at philosophical SF,"Very interesting look at the future, from a late 1950's, early 1960's perspective. The heart of the book is a moral crisis introduced by an alien race with perfect morals but no belief in a god. Also interesting to look at as a first contact novel from a time that was less xenophobic and more nuclear disaster preoccupied."
2,Bulkier than going with a right angle cord,"I purchased this for a 19"" I just mounted with a 'space saver' slim mount from home depot. This is the slimmest mount I have found and gets the TV about .75"" from the wall. This product did not work with this mount; it still sticks too far from the television (19"" Vizio). However, a right angle power cord just barely fits.The other downside to this product is its cost. $15 ... really? I get it your the only game in town, but come on ... that's just ridiculous. If you are in need of a product like this, just replace the entire power cable and save the headache."
5,Functional product,Not a bad product as it feels pretty sturdy and does what it's supposed to do. While I don't use this for any sort of home electronics (I use this for some lighting I use for DJing) it sits in well in the socket and doesn't move much. I just think it would make more sense if they would make full-on right angle cords as opposed to adapters like this.
1,Still waiting,I ordered this product a few weeks ago and am still waiting for it to ship. I was asked to review a product they have not delivered on.
5,Research and Development,We purchased the Welch Allyn Holder for Spare Probe for a research and development project. It was not a knock off and arrived as advertised. The product also arrived in a timely manner.
1,"""12 O'clock High - Vols. 1 & 2""","Horrible mistake on my part when ordering. Thought this was ""12 O'clock High, the Series. For me, this is a piece of trash. Jack Warehime"
1,VERY MISLEADING,This is listed with the original movie. IT has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the original series. Amazon is FOOLING customers withthe sale of this item!!!! DO NOT BUY!
5,Excellent Swing Music!,"This sountrack is an excellent collection of some of the best big band swing music! I love it! Great songs like Sing, Sing, Sing and Bei Mir Bist Du Schon. There are only a couple songs by James Horner and the original movie soundtrack. So don't buy this if you are expecting the original soundtrack. But the swing in it is excellent. Though some of the songs have some bad sound quality, they are really old recordings and cannot be qualified much more. Great songs!"
5,Swingsational,It just makes you wanna get up and dance. I could listen to this CD all day long. The movie is awesome and the dancing is really good! If you want to start swinging then watch the movie and buy the soundtrack.
5,An excellent send-up!,"I'd read the original ""Dune"", along with most of the sequels, back in college. By the time I got to about the 4th or 5th book, the ponderous mysticism and self absorbed seriousness were starting to get really annoying. This stuff just begged to be satirized, and ""Doon"" was the perfect antidode! The funny names, the substitute of beer and frat party imagery for the original ""spice"" were spot on and absolutely hilarious! Best of all was the dramatic fight scene in which Mauve Bib (aka ""Assol"") defeats his foe in a duel of ever nastier put downs. Like ""Bored of the Rings"", this is a first rate send up of a Sci-Fi/fantasy classic, and should offend only those who take the original WAY too seriously!"
2,case open ...again,"Years ago I came to the conclusion the assasination MUST have been a conspiracy. But later in life after some research started to be open minded to the idea that Oswald acted alone.I read this book with the hope, that it would close this case (for me). Incredibly, what Posner did for me, was leave me thinking that it is impossible all these events are just a series of random coincidences.It is clear after reading the book that Oswald was not just some nut who acted alone. ."
1,Posner's fairy tale,"As a film maker I learned years ago that the camera does not lie. Namely, the Zapuder film. The fatal shot that struck the President's right temple could've only come from one place, the grassy knoll to the right front of JFK. Case Closed! Posner's book is a silly attempt to justifiy the Warren Commission report. Research his background and you can draw your own conclusion about his motivations."
1,A Very High Treason,"As far as I'm concerned, lying (bone)-heads like Posner and those who support his idiotic theories are as evil and twisted as the men who really killed president Kennedy. Fork-tongued traitors, one and all, who are making the disintergration of this country possible by standing by in approval as more of our rights and liberties are literally being shot down. When Posner gets to Hell, he can hold a seminar with all the other lone-nut pushers out there while LBJ, Earl Warren and Lucifer look on and smile."
1,Too Many Errors,"Sorry folks, Posner's work no more closes the case than does any other book on the subject...his ONLY advantage is the mainstream media hype he received that most conspiracy writers don't. I myself counted at least 100 substantial FACTUAL errors in his work and, I have seen enough of his responses to requests for documentation of his alleged ""interviews"", along with statements from those ""interviewed"" to have serious doubts about the claims that I can't check. You might find it interesting to contact FAILURE ANALYSIS and ask them to comment on Posner's use of their scientific evaluation of the ""single bullet theory"". Their response will tell you all you need to know along with video/audio tapes of his debates with knowledgeable assassination researchers. You'll notice that now when he ""appears"", its always as a single commentator. On the other hand, it is interesting to see how facts can be twisted and distorted through bluster, ommission and hyperbole when there's a buck in it."
5,Excellent Book,"Gerald Posner's ""Case Closed"" and Larry Sturdivan's ""The JFK Myths"" are the two best books on the JFK assassination. ""Case Closed"" provides an overview of the entire case. Much of it is a biography of Oswald. ""The JFK Myths"" is much more limited in scope and just talks about the technical issues of the case in laymen's language. ""Case Closed"" is mistaken on a couple of technical points, namely, a bullet probably was not deflected by the oak tree causing a fragment to nick James Tague. That fragment probably came from the final shot that struck JFK's head. On the other hand, ""The JFK Myths"" talks very little about Oswald and his motives. Reading both books will give a reader a lot of knowledge about the case."
1,Mind Closed,"It's really pretty simple: if you believed the BS that was in the Warren Commission's report on Kennedy's assasination, you'll probably believe this BS too. Posner doesn't really bring anything new to the table, basically falling back on the same skewed logic and lame 'evidence' that most intelligent people dismissed over forty years ago. By the end of this mess I had put together a list of over fifty valid questions which Mr. Posner chose to avoid. The cover-up continues."
1,Ridiculous,"I can't even give it a star but it's a requirement. Part surmise part fact, this is not definitive in any aspect of the word. He cherrie picks his way through the evidence."
3,Decent - But there is better.,"If you want to read about how Oswald was a sleazy and generally dislikable person - Then get this book.But if you want a pluasable explanation about the assassination, check out Mortal Error by Bonar Menninger - much more plausible than a full metal jacketed bullet getting splintered on a tree branch."
1,"David, Leon and the guys all say hi!","Posner should resign his post at the CIA and read ""Let Justice Be Done"" by Bill Davy.This book gets one star, simply because I can't give it ZERO. It's a pack of lies from start to finish."
1,"Appallaing gaps, inaccuracies","If you pick your facts, you can make any case. Posner has a noted background as a debater, and his approach to facts steadfastly evades the wealth of verified data available on tis subject.The case as presented by Posner begins with unconditional acceptance of the single-bullet theory, which was rejected by every government inquiry ever since the Warren Report, and refuses even to acknowledge the tome of evidence it cannot explain.This is poor research, and readers are urged to seek out a copy of David Lifton's Best Evidence for the most honest and complete account to date."
1,OJ Should Hire Posner,"This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing ""scientific"" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it , for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations."
1,"I SHOULD HAVE ""CLOSED"" THIS BOOK AFTER THE FIRST PAGES...","What are the intentions of this writer? I don't get it. THis books adds almost nothing to the Kennedy Mystery, except denying the only fact we have: thre was not possibility to one shooter achieve what he did."
1,Worst book ever written on the assassination,"I wasn't sure anything could surprass some of the crud written by David Belin and others in the Warren Commission cover up, but Posner did it. He's ignored facts, stretched or fabricated others, and was really nothing but a propaganda tool for the government and it's totally discredited ""lone assasin"" hokum. Don't waste your money on this drivel."

But what is more notable than that is the fact that the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.
1,Explore Both Sides,"The purpose of this book is clear: to distract attention away from the recent scientific breakthroughs in the physical evidence by focusing on the fantastical marksman, Lee Harvey Oswald. I would recommend the books Killing Kennedy and Assassination Science if you're interested in hard scientific proof and not speculations, ommisions and lies passed off as fact. Both explore the heroic work of Dr. David Mantik, a radio-oncologist who has proven forgeries in the official X-rays. Please, people, explore both sides, don't fall for polemic and propaganda."
1,Government Disinformation,"The Zapruter film shows Kennedy's head being thrown back and to the left. This indicates that he was shot from the front. Most people shot from behind don't have their heads thrown back, do they? According to Posner people who think that this is evidence that Kennedy was shot from the front ""don't understand the physics involved.""Skip this and read Crossfire by Jim Marrs"
1,Faery Wicca Book 2 Review,"Again, this book like the first is among the first books on Wicca that I read and, like my review for the first book, when I learned that much of the material has been plagerized and the books pulled out of print, I've found myself reevaulating my thoughts on this book.I found this book to be cumbersome and a difficult read. More material to reference when you need to look it up then a straight through read.I keep the books out of curiosity and to say I have them. I don't really read or use them for heavy reference any more."
5,Great for curious kids,My nephew was 5 when I gave him this book as a gift. He is a very curious child and is fascinated by learning how the body works. The pictures in this book are excellent and in a couple of years he will be able to read it on his own. Great for curious kids.
4,Still a lovely toy,"I'm a grandma, I ordered this for some sewing that I'm doing. I was pleased to open the package and find its one thing that has not changed over the years. This one is well made, the selection of loops that came with it are wonderful colors and I'm sure when I have finished with it, I'll give to a youngster I know who will also enjoy it."
4,cute!,"i expected nothing from this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it. i did not fall asleep nor did i leave in the middle. matthew and liz were likable characters and for movie purposes i felt there was an attraction between them. in general it was light, funny and relatively clean if you want to take older kids. i am glad i saw it."
2,Matthew Perry has better movies,So far I was surprised with Matthew Perry's movies. They were better than the newspapers wrote. This movie isn't that great unfortunately. It's a romantic comedy but you don't really recognize anything going on between the two main protagonists. Also the storyline is not particularly funny either. You can see as well that Matthew Perry had a hard time while this was shot
1,Totally useless,"I've watched it until the end, I admit it. I seldom leaves a movie before its ending. But this was torture, sheer torture. What was I thinking when I rent this?Simple. I tought: this has Elizabeth Hurley, georgeous as ever, azamingly beautiful. Also, here we have Matthew Perry, a good comic actor, even if you don't enjoy FRIENDS. So, what went wrong? Everything.They have no chemistry togehter. The script is a bad mess full of bad jokes (the worst of them all being when Perry has to ""help"" a bull to get a full erection..... You will simply not believe what your eyes are seeing... One of the worst comedies ever!"
2,Matthew Perry can't play anyone else apart from Chandler and Liz Hurley can't act,"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. The film's rubbish. If you see this in a shop, EVEN if it's really cheap, walk away. What utter nonsense. It's not even worth watching it's that predictable. Bruce Campbell is absolutely wasted in this movie, which is even more disappointing.And now I'm stuck with it."
4,Servicing Sara,"A process server (Matthew Perry) is convinced by a woman (Elizabeth Hurley) to serve divorce papers to her husband, who lives in Texas, and the duo promptly embarks on a road trip from New York City to the Lone Star State to find him. On their adventure together, the server starts to fall for his companion.Matthew is one of the world's funniest stars and Lizzy is one of the world's hottest women"
4,Good tips on breaking 90 maybe,"This book is good for beginners. Although some of the instruction is complex and too much at times, it can show the beginning golfer how to play better golf. However, I found the following really great for showing one how to actually be a zero handicap golfer or better. This book is called:The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better by Patrick Leonardiisbn 1933023090With the help of Leonardi's book I now can shoot in the mid-seventies. Soon I will be able to break par. Leonardi shows how golf is really not that hard and can be mastered with his excellent and easy to learn techniques."
3,Mel man,"Probably not on the top 100 of all time, but Conspiracy Theory is a good combination of suspense, plot, action and stellar acting that both Mel and Julia fans can appreciate."
4,A Big Commercial Hit,"I think it's a very watchable movie that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is...a well-crafted, commercial vehicle for two big stars. Gibson was entertaining doing paranoia and Julia Roberts was just fine. I thought both Patrick Stewart and his nose kept you watching. The scene where Gibson takes Roberts to his apartment was clever and funny. But I didn't care for the ending. (Maybe a spoiler ahead) I could see no reason why Hollywood couldn't find a way for Gibson and Roberts to get together.The movie reminds me in a way of another big, commercial movie with Julia Roberts, The Pelican Brief. Both are obviously made by professionals, both are great popcorn movies, both have interesting set pieces, and both -- for me -- have unsatisfying endings. For the Pelican Brief, I think she should have had, at minimum, a smooch or two with Denzel Washington."
4,Where Nero Wolfe Lives,"Reviews the career of the famous fictional detective, Nero Wolfe, as recorded in the books by Rex Stout. Since Wolfe ""stoutly"" refused to leave his house, practically all of his detecting took place here. Discussions of events are provided, with detailed layouts of the house and of individual rooms. There is also a bibliography of the seventy or so cases in which Wolfe acted. Ken Darby is a well-known choir director, composer, and lyricist, and clearly a Nero Wolfe enthusiast."
5,Bouncy Dusty at her Early Best,"This is one of the earliest Dusty albums to be released in America. It shows how much Dusty was influenced by both Motown (especially her friend Martha Reeves) and the reigning girl groups of the era (especially those bad girls, The Shangri-las). Dusty had tasted American soul music, loved it, and sang it back to us with her usual impeccable timing and perfect voice. This doesn't compare to the classic ""Dusty in Memphis"", but it's great fun just the same. Brava!"
3,A time to kill,I have not viewed the movie yet because I had sent the origional back because of lack of a disc label on the top side. The replacement came through the same way. I don't know if this is something the manufacture forgot to do or it is suppposed to come this way but I'm not satified. I'm sure the movie is OK.
2,Not Satisfied,"On the first half, the movie cuts off about twenty minutes earlier than it's supposed to. On the second half, it skips. I'm just disappointed with it. It was a brand new movie, and should play all the way thru. It's one of my favorite movies, and I am just not pleased at all."
5,Court Room Drama,"This is a excellent court room drama movie, it has everything,actors are excellent,you will have a large ranch of emotions during this movie,it's a keeper, The delivery was earlier than what was stated"
2,Ridiculous story,"I guess the novel is to blame for the story. But then the film makers selected the novel, one must presume.The story is just silly. Just two examples: The lawyer, who desperately needs help, is approached by a beautiful woman who is very qualified, and who wants to help him for free. So what does he do? He turns her down! No reason for this even hinted at.Second: when they are about to lose the case, they finally get smart and win it by... (surprise) appealing purely to the jury's *emotions*, not logic. Great, a wonderful triumph for justice!"
1,eh,i was ;ooking for a good cinnamon coffee...this one fell short. i didn't care for the f;avor which wasn't much but the cinnamon flavor wasn't there. i am sorry
1,Much Worse Than the First Film,"The sequel to Spy Kids is much worse than the first movie. There is no plot to the movie, the whole movie is just having the Cortez kids and the Giggle kids showing off to the OSS. The movie is very stupid. DO NOT go see this movie in theatres, I had this on my save list before I saw it but now after seeing it I am taking it off and so should you. This is a terrible movie, if you gave the first movie a 3 or below than skip this. If you gave it a 4 or 5 you might actually think it was OK. This movie is for the much younger set (10 and below.) DO NOT see this movie."
4,SPY KIDS 2 IS 2 TIMES BETTER,"SPY KIDS 2 IS A IMPROVEMENT OVER PART 1 AND IT SHOWS MORE COOLER DEVICES AND EVEN A LITTLE BUG TOY{UNTIL IT GETS CRUSHED},BUT THIS ACTION-PACKED ADVENTURE IS RECOMMENDED TO THOSE WHO LIKE TO WATCH AGENT FILMS LKE INSPECTOR GADGET 1 AND 2 AND AGENT CODY BANKS.I LIKED THE SCENE WHEN THE BIZARRE ANIMALS LIKE HORSEFLY,SPIDER-MONKEY,AND MORE.A HILARIOUS FAMILY FILM."
3,runs out in no time !,I got a ip1800 printer with my computer purchase and found that the ink runs out so quickly. I also own a HP photosmart printer and it uses ink more efficiently. HP's #56 ink can normally last much longer even though the print quality is not as good. I just hate to purchase the ink once in a while. They are expensive too.
5,Great Deal for Twin Pack!,"Considering the free shipping, I haven't been able to find a better deal at shops I have to drive to for ink when my printer runs out."
5,Perfect for businesses and LARGE order printing needs.,"This was by far the cheapest and most effective printer ink on the market. The PG-40 covers a wide varieties of printers such as mine - the MP210.If you went to COMPUSA, OfficeDepot, OfficeMax, and other similar stores you'd end up paying $20+ for ONE of the ink cartridges.Why not pay under $40 for 2? MUCH better deal.The ink itself works excellently and is easily installed into many of the printers listed.Amazon makes it easy to see if your ink is compatible with your printer on the main details page.VERY satisfied with my purchase as I will have a backup ink cartridge at a very affordable price.Pros:+ Cheap, affordable+ Great quality+ Works on many of the Canon printers such as the MP series+ Always sealed and packed so it'll last a long time+ Awesome dealCons:- None so far"
5,Canon ink pack user,"I love the Canon printer. The real cost is in the ink toner cartridges,as we know.But the price was great and buying the 2-packs saves you time and money overall.Hint: when it comes time to print watch the dialogue box come up and print the information at a higher speed. It will use less ink overall,but you ill have to give up some clarity.purchased thru Amazon wil save you money.Finally, when you print,you will still use Black,even when the images are photos.Steve"
3,"Best value, for what it is","So yeah, this is probably the best value you'll find for what these are. They still run out quickly. This combined with the woes of the fast drying and mandatory color cartridge in my Canon Pixma printer made me switch to laser. Bye-bye inkjet..."
4,Could be a little better.,A top notch sander. The only problem so far is the belt has a hard time running absolutely true'
1,Sloppy-engineered Expensive Junk,"I had heard great things about Milwaukee, so I paid dearly for this one and was greatly disappointed. For the price, you will receive a motor that will pull a trailer but is too heavy to carry, and the adjustment mechanism is made of large, thick chunks of metal that won't break if you back over the thing, but the sloppy machining make this moot since the tool won't hold the settings. Forego the ""beef"", save some money and buy a tool that is precision machined and inteligently engineered."
4,Disk 3,I give the show itself 4 stars. I would give it 5 but the problems with disk three prevents me from doing so. I got the replacement today but the samething happened with the replacement disk. I am debating on returning the replacement or not. Other than that I love the show itself.
1,Bad Disc Three,"Like many others have posted, disc three is defective. I have sent for a replacement but don't hold out much hope of any improvement."
4,"Love the series, disappointed with ""bad"" discs","We too have received a bad disc #3, twice. Amazon overnited the replacement of the original but tonite when we called they were only offering refunds. They are no longer selling MI-5, Volume 5, the CSR said that they were afraid we would only get another bad disc. She said we will just have to watch the website to see when they will be selling it again."
2,Not Amazon Prime Approved,"Why is Season 5 not included like other seasons with Amazon Prime? Its not logical to have every other season included and omitting only one.I will give first two shows 5 stars though, but they are not in Amazon prime."
3,Jerzees Crewneck Sweatshirt Med Black,"I thought this was a woman's sweatshirt - it was black like I wanted, but the sleeves were MUCH too long - I gave it to my boyfriend and it fit him fine.I'm still looking for a woman's black sweatshirt. The item did arrive in a timely manner - but it didn't fit me."
2,Received the wrong product,Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt. Can you help me with the return? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
5,Just what I wanted,The sweatshirt is great. The color is true red and this sizing was great. I used it to make a Christmas sweatshirt.Fast shipping.
4,Great purchase!,I am very happy with the fast delivery and the sweatshirt seems to be very well made. A few washings will be the real test but so far everything looks great with it.
5,nice simple sweatshirt,"My daughter needed a plain sweatshirt in either white or black for school so we chose this one when we could not find any sweatshirts in the clothing stores without emblems. It is nice, not too thin, not too thick. Washes well."
3,It's OK. A bit awkward.,"For what it is I guess this thing does the job. It is somewhat flimsy IMO and awkward to use. If you don't balance it out, it doesn't stay hung properly. Meaning you have to hang an equal number of garments on each side of the bar inside the bag and balance out the weight.The bottom is not rigid at all. The instructions indicate you should lay the flimsy piece of cardboard packing on the bottom of the bag to accomplish that, which doesn't help much.It is not something I would want to be reaching in and out of every day. For clothes you wear infrequently and want to keep the dust off of, it should suffice."
2,110 Bottle,"Very disappointed. At this price I expected a much better unit. It's not even varnished like it shows in the picture, it's just plain wood. I don't recommend it unless the price is half of what they charge for it."
3,almost oem,the bracket that holds the brake line required a little bending to fit the brake line on. and i thought the valving seems a little soft.
2,Did not like........,"I seem to be the only one that did not care for this book. (Although that made it easy for me to sell it on half.com).I did not feel the caring and empathy of the author for the kids that I have in other books of this type that I have read, i.e. Torrey Hayden's books. Mary MacCracken, etc. Granted, these are two different types of kids. I just do not seem to care for his style of writing."
2,"It may be for a good cause and all, but...","I love Mark Salzman's novels. I can sense the goodness of the author implied by those works. I can sense the goodness of the reporter of True Notebooks. I think it is great to teach troubled kids how to express themselves in writing. Good work! But that does not mean that I really want to immerse myself in their efforts. After reading a few examples of the students' efforts, I have the picture. But really, none of it is very surprising. The students produce the sort of thing you would expect. There is no development in Salzman's account of his experience either. He seems to have become swept up in his own surprise that these young people are capable of any expression at all."
4,Another great report shoe for $12.79,"I paid $12.79 for this shoe and with 5 women in our family, got 1 taker. The rest did not like the shoe. It is a big stiff. But I thought it was cute. I got it in white. For the price, it was a decent deal."
5,One of the Best Books,I read this book when I was in 6th grade. I was so caught up on it that I read it in One Day. It's one of my favorite. I like all her book but this one was especially excellent.
1,Outdated,"The only valid concept here is buying a stock acting better than the market, a divergence. It's coupled with using divergences in his accumulation/distribution indicator, which acts similar to On Balance Volume and other volume based indicators. The market timing indicators are all outdated or useless because of changes in the market. For example using the yield of the market (because of tax laws yields will remain low) and mutual fund cash levels (most funds are required to be fully invested with minimal amounts set aside for redemptions). This is not to knock Larry, he is very knowlegeable and you'd be better off with his more recent books. BTW, these concepts were not mentioned in his most recent book ""The Right Stock at the Right Time"" so I'd suspect he doesn't use them anymore."
5,amazing,"this is great product for a large auditorium. For former dancers and for people who wants to start to dance.i like her fitness program on the floor - really amazing - with minimal efforts, maximum muscle relaxation and training.i like all Stefanie Herman programs and presented some to friends."
1,Wrong encoding it won't work!!! I bought two and compared to LEXMARK!!! DON'T BUY!!!!,"My first order from Andrew's Genuine Supplies was 8/16/12 for this product and in January 2013 I put it in my printer and ordered the next one only to find out that the product is defective and not Lexmark. If you look at the gold contact area on the cartridges you can see that it is different from the actual Lexmark cartridge! They are also marked ""NOT FOR CUSTOMER USE!"" and the number on the actual cartridge is 18L0220 NOT 18L0032 as the foil package says. I can not get a refund on this because the time has past so I have lost $25.07. I can olny get a refund on the one I just ordered in January of this year so I wanted to warn anyone that is looking to buy anything from ANDREW'S GENUINE SUPPLIES!"
5,Lexmark 82 cartridge from Infinite Surplus,Original cartridge was received within 3 days of order. This is my second order from them. First cartridge worked very well. I will always order from them.
4,Printer or cartridge?,"I have been having stalling problems since I began using this specific cartridge. Is it the cartridge or my printer? It concerns me that the ink cartridge arrived without it's box just the inner foil pouch was inserted in a padded envelope and mailed. The pouch was flattened around the cartridge.That certainly reduces the protection of the cartridge while it probably save shipping costs for the sender. This cost considerably less than what I paid at Staples. I will buy it one more time and if I have the same problem, I will seek another source."
4,Not bad for a disaster flick,"Disaster movies are probably the most dependable draw in Hollywood, though they often rate poorly due to horrible dialogue, bad acting, and an over-reliance on special effects. But this is one of the few exceptions. Starring a cast full of good actors and actresses such as Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, this movie relies on its drama, dialogue and good storytelling to keep you engaged for 2+ hours. Based loosely on a book, the plot is quite believable as it traces the subtle spread of a killer virus from Sub-Saharan Africa into the USA. The movie follows both the civilians who unwittingly to US soil, along with the government authorities who try to fight it, some of whom have secrets to hide. For a disaster movie, there is minimal usage of special effects, with only two explosions, one at the end of the movie, and one at the beginning of the movie. Overall, very good."
4,Bluray Review,"I havent seen this movie since i was a kid. (born in 85) but all i know is this movie creeped me out. I recently picked up the bluray version on black friday, and just finished watching it earlier tonight. I must say the film itself looks very good. I cant say much about audio since im currently without a home theater system, but i will have my new one tomorrow. Here are my thoughts:Video: 4/5Overall video is very clear and crisp. Gets grainy during some night scenes, but thats actually common with most HD films imo. Id say a solid transfer to bluray. especially for a film made in 1995. I hope ""Heat"" looks this good if bluray ever remasters it.Audio: n/aCant say much since i currently dont have a home theater system. But it sounded good on my televsion.Movie: 5/5I think its a great thriller to show how deadly viruses can be, and the performances of actors/actresses make this a good satisfying purchase."
2,Really Basic Stuff,"If you've already read about Boston Terriers, you will not find anything new here, that's for sure. This was written a long time ago."
5,Dusty sings classic hits you will never tire of.,"After hearing Dusty sing ""Every Day I Have To Cry"" on England's TV show ""Ready, Steady,Go"" I knew I had to have this on CD. Steve Alaimo's original sounds so much better when Dusty sings it. The track is full stereo and wonderful. Most CD's have cuts that you file under delete but not this one. There are no clunkers on this CD. Let's face it. No one can do ""Mama Said"" like the Shirelles"" but Dusty did a credible job. Her performance of ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" was excellent. If you like Dusty Springfield you will treasure this CD."
5,A-mazing,This cd is absolutley a peice of art. number 10 (short stories with tragic endings) is a beautifully written song with a talented female guest on vocals. every song has its own story. no two songs sound the same. guitar ripps are very intricate and the drumming double bass is insane. check it out.
5,one of the best if not the best metalcore emocore whatever cds ever.,"this cd willblow you away every single second it is playing. the guitar is so amazing so far beyond most any other band in this genre, the riffs the melodies display so much talent and great song writing. then thers the drums not only can this guy sing but he is an amazing drummer just listen to him play and you will see what im talking about. this cd in my point f view sets the standard for any other band out there. as for their newest cd sure it was a lot more simplisit cmost of the time and had a lot more clean singing and the first time i heard it i didnt like it, know that the first song i heard from this and was after dinner payback but i got tbyb before i got their new one, but it grew on me and i think its a pretty good cd not as groundbreaking jawdropping awesome as this. anyway if you like any type of heavy music whatsoever you should definately pick this up immediately and be prepared to get your mind blown."
4,Unspoiled,"We've heard it over and over again. This is what FATA used to sound like and it is much better. Sin and Sorrow, Too bad you're beautiful is pre- sell out. Their later stuff is great too, but just like Underoath or many other bands, their old stuff rocks much better. If you jumped on the bandwagon like most with ""the afterdinner payback"" then maybe you should just stick with Their later cd's, but if you truely appreciate their unique sound then their earlier stuff is great. It's a bit less, how do we say, radioish."
5,The Lonely Winds,"B.I. Flight's The Lonely Winds is a thoroughly engrossing novel! I read this book in record time; I simply did NOT want to put it down! The characters are very highly developed with intricate, yet familiar personalities we all can relate to. The style of writing uses clichés to it's advantage, playing off the reader's anticipations and then, much to my delight, sends the reader reeling with spontaneous, well thought-out scenarios. Flight exercises his creativity by using an alien world as a setting, but does not follow the tired standard of using strange, unbelievable scenery and characters. It is truly difficult to believe that this is Flight's first novel, and I for one cannot wait much longer for the sequel to hit shelves. Please hurry!"
3,Debut 45th Anniversary Isao Sasaki Best,"Unlike the comprehensive 2 disk 40th Anniversary Song Book Trial Best which features slower jazz renditions of his anime theme songs. This 25 track cd has mostly original treatments of 70's anime songs including Battleship Yamato,(Deep Red Scarf),Casshern, Getta Robo,J.A.K.Q Degekitai,Dekeranger,Galaxay Railways. Highlights: full version of the opening to Gatchaman 2,opening and closing themes to Goranger so Sasaki fans can ""Banbarabanbanban"" to their hearts' content. Insert includes a few pix,song descriptions and a note from the man himself as long as you can read Japanese."
4,great hopper,"This is a really good hopper i enjoy playing with it. It shoot 20 some bps, i dont shoot that high, but overall great hopper.only thing...its got a really small neck, so you probably have to get an adjustable feedneck, even with my adjustable, i have to take plyers to tighten it enough."
4,Great!!,"Choir Boy is fantastic! Quick to read, yet thought provoking, it will take anyone back to the pain of being a teenager trying to figure out who they are. I laughed out loud many a times and found myself aching for the teenage traumas Berry was going through. Highly recommended!"
1,I'm still waiting for the book to be delivered!!,It's been well over a month since I ordered this book and still have not recieved it.
3,Philosophy Spiced Apple Cider 3-in-one,"This product is just okay. It has a nice scent to it, although I almost prefer the scents at Bath & Body Works better (and I think it's even a bit cheaper there!).I didn't really expect to use it as a shampoo, but nonetheless, those who think they will, probably shouldn't. It's not very moisturizing at all. I tried it once and it left my hair stripped and dry (like using dish soap). Again, I didn't intend to use it as a shampoo, so I'm not too disappointed; however, I am a little upset at the misleading advertising.I had high hopes for Philosophy products, but the reality is a bit disappointing for the price tag..."
4,A light cd remembering Frank Sinatra,"Gunärs Rozenbergs gives us a tribute to the great Frank Sinatra leading and making arrangements for a selection of great successes of the fabulous singer in charge of Riga Recording Studio Orchestra, compact and balanced sound very much in the style of the ' 80s. We can admire the beauty of the themes that were made famous by Sinatra and enjoy a careful interpretation."
3,Not really a companion to the play...,"I loved the play Copenhagen - saw it four times, and it re-sparked my interest in physics, which I read about as a hobby. I know, weird, but whatever, I'm a smart chick.Anyway, this book isn't about the play at all, really, it's about an exchange of letters between the author and one of the actors in the London production of Copenhagen. And it's well-crafted, I think anyone who enjoys a good mystery, and a bit of the backstage goings-on would enjoy the book. It certainly captivated me and both Michael Frayn and David Burke write well and with a good deal of dry British humor."
4,fun paint ball action flick,"INteresting film of hunt and chase involving paint ball games gone bad.....loved the ""death by paint ball gun in mouth""scene!!!"
1,Jones' Mouthpiece,"I can't believe this book is being taken seriously. She smears the truly valient people who escaped from the People's Temple and exposed it in almost the identical words that the Temple stooges used at the time these people were trying to break free. Her verdict on Deborah Layton? She only left because Jones ""rejected her sexually."" This is someone to take seriously as a giver of information? She repeats ad nauseum Jones' claim that the child, John, whose parents were trying to get from Jonestown, was really Jones' child. Even assuming that there was a possibility that this was the truth, how would this woman know it for a fact? But she repeats it as if it were an unquestionable face, thereby revealing herself as a mere repeater of whatever Jones said. All of Jones' paranoia was also repeated verbatum. The Temple is a victim of all those bad people out there. The CIA and the FBI and the yellow press and all those evil concerned relatives. But he was a paragon. Yeah. Right."
1,From the Dog House,"I read this book. It put me off my biscuits for a week. Bo is afraid this wagger did not get her distemper shoots. Instead, she escaped from the dog pound to try and find her Master...Jim Jones' grave to lie on. I am afraid that after reading this book, I feel more like I am snake bit as oppposed to Snake Dancing.In closing, Bo has to give this book...Two paws way down!!! Sorry, Efferin make sure you get your vaccination before writing a book."
3,children's sermons,"I hasve this book - somewhere. It's probably still in my storage unit after a cross-country move.Still the classic for kid's time, and still has lots of useable stuff."
5,LEXMARK 83,QUALITY PRODUCT AT A SUPER-LOW PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING. THIS PRODUCT WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT INTO USE AND HAS BEEN PRODUCING EXCELLENT COLOR PRINTS. THANKS!!
2,liked adnd better,"wizards of the coast messed the game up.when tsr was making adnd the game was better.im 10 years old but my friend john has ben playin for since his fresh man year in highschool in 94.when he taught me to play he still used the adnd rules.it was clearer,faster playin,and made me use my imagination more than 3rd edition.so if you want to learn how to play try to find and old adnd manual.trust me.you'll have more fun."
5,Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition Player's Handbook,"Around my area, if you said you played Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, you got alot of scoffing and smirts. The grandfather of all roleplaying games didn't get any respect like it was some senile old buzzard. Well it seems that Wizards of the Coast has found the Fountain of Youth and gave the game brand new masterwork sword. This game has been resurrected and brought back into the Gaming Arena and is kicking butt and taking names. This book is a worthy find and just kicked the crap out its competators. Congratz WotC. This is the best product I've purchased in a long time."
1,a dissapointment,i have been playing dungeons and dragons since 1994 and i love it. i started playing 2nd edition in '95 and loved that even more. it brings out your imagination and 2nd edition is everythig a good RPG should be. however 3rd edition COMPLETELY strays from tradidton and flops around all the rules. it has been dumbed down and hyped up as pure money maker and no longer carries the traditions started in the original game.
1,3.5 edition has arived,"Woc has done it again. They have released another editon, and it is supearior. Edition 3.5 is very like third (Hence the .5), but realy cleans up the classes and makes things more balanced. This book is good, but the new Players Handbook 3.5 Edition just blows it out of the water. They tweaked all that needed tweeking, and left the good stuff there. Toss your third Edition and go buy 3.5!"
4,A Good Start,"I've been playing D&D in many variations for over 20 years, and while this introduction into 3rd Edition D&D doesn't have all the features I might have liked (how could it?) it has much to offer. The ability to customize characters is much greater than before. The blending of skills and classes is well implemented. Obviously, the book serves as a springboard for more books and supplements to come but it is still a welcomed step to an evolving game."
2,Good_Try!! But.......,I am a player for 19 years. I have seen some of the first edition books and i must admit that the new edition rocks!!! The rules about skills and feats are perfect and i liked also the rules about attacks of oportunity and base attack bonus. However the book is awfully written. The order in which the rules are written is very bad. I did understand the rules but a beginner (a person who starts playing D&D now) will find it very hard to understand some basic things.
4,An Outstanding Effort,"I've been playing since 1983. The new edition changes quite a bit, but most of it is for the better. The game mechanics have been cleaned up, lots of new options have been added, and the underlying flavor of the game has been preserved.Only a few things keep the book from being a five-star: The yellow ""fake parchment"" background on the first page of each chapter is annoying. The spell list is not broken down by level. Half-orcs get cheated a bit. They left alignment in.Aside from the contents, one thing that amazed me was that the list price. I bought my 2nd edition handbook in 1989 for the same price. The book appears to be of the same high quality as my 2nd edition books, and lists for less than the latest version of the 2nd edition book. Kudos to Wizards for giving us such a fine product at a very reasonable price."
2,Dumbing down the old rules,"Third edition AD&D is a double edged blade. On one hand, some of the revamped charts are easier, faster, more convinient. On the other hand, the need to roleplay is completely eliminated. Any race and any class can do anything they want, for instance, there could be a halfling necromancer/bard/paladin. Even then, they get minor access to the abilities of the classes they are not. The barriers between races and classes that make a choice of a character unique are destroyed, and some of the rules that gave the characters diversity have been oversimplified. As a result, the fun of roleplaying your character in certain ways in certain situations has been sucked out and replaced by mindless hacknslash clerical battles. If you like mindless battles and lack of roleplaying boundaries, buy 3rd edition. If you also like AD&D for the necessary roleplaying, stick with 2nd."
1,IT RUINS CLASSIC ROLEPLAYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The second edition was great. It did justice to the first edititon. However, third edition completely changed the systems which were classic to d&d. It not only reversed most of the rolls, but it also cheapens the tradition. I don't recomend this, so buy second edition instead, it's better!"
5,Going on three weeks...,"If you buy only one Court and Spark, buy Bless You. I purchased Ventura Whites (well acclaimed) and the newer Dead Diamond river, and while each have some strong content, they don't come very close to Bless You. Sorry no words on the sound - see other reviews - but I really like it. Haven't parted with a daily dose for about three weeks now..."
3,5 stars for the sound quality but not one of Shirley's best albums,"I would take issue with M Van der Meer's comments regarding the sound quality of this Classic Records reissue. I own 39 of the 47 that were released, and I consider all of them to be superior to their mass market counterparts. As with all of Classic's gold CD reissues, this one was remastered by Bernie Grundman. His work is among the best that others in his profession have produced.The music is another story, and, in my opinion, this is not one of Ms Horn's more enjoyable albums. I don't much care for the Quincy Jones sound, and that is, for me, this album's undoing."
2,"Not Stellar, but Interesting","I was somewhat disappointed in this book -- lots of pictures of beautiful quilts, but not much else. I would have been happier just checking it out of the library, instead of adding it to my personal library. Plus, I failed to notice that it was soft cover; I prefer hardcover books."
5,Best coverage of combination themes,"I own seven books on combinations and tactics. This book is my favorite because of the great examples, and the clear way that the different tactics are explained and reinforced.The tactical ideas are grouped together, and there are lots of examples on themes an inexperienced player might not have encounted before. For example Discovered Attack and Discovered Check. When you get it you will see what I mean. It is perfect for the player who wants to take their game to the next level."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is excellent for young ballerinas or even older ballerinas. The photos are nice and clear. I like the way it explains about the girl and what she does and class, what to wear, etc."
2,Not Great for Translation,I got this thinking I could use it to translate Somali writing. It really does not work for that. Maybe if one were traveling to Somalia (not very appealing prospect at this time) you could use it to point to words. You could not use it to translate a passage written in Somali.
3,Portable and customizable math game,I bought this for my son as a stocking stuff and forgot to give it to him! I remembered it after Christmas and we've played it a few times since. There are many ways to play it to make it harder or easier depending on your child's math ability. I like that it is portable. On the other hand I find it easy to beat him at it - it would be more fun with people who are around the same ability at math.
2,too hard for young children,This is very difficult for young children. My 6&7 yr olds did not last long playing it. I was not impressed with this game.
1,No wiring diagram?,"Yet another mediocre (at best) publication from the leaders in vintage motorcycle publications. This manual, like all Clymer's, adheres to the minimalist approach of instrcutions. Assembly is the reverse of disassembly after all. The factor that weighs most heavily on the single-star rating is the total lack of a wiring diagram."
2,For diehards only,"Without Robin in the fold, there seems to be a lack of direction for this album. Maybe Barry Gibb was correct when commenting on this album, and especially the 1st track: ""If we'd only had our minds on something else."" While slightly changing the title of the track, he hits the nail on the head. The only bright spot here is I.O.I.O. This jaunty Maurice ditty is inspired by Maurice's Africa holiday and is refresing on an otherwise uninspired album."
5,An actual dictionary exposing war propaganda usage and terms,"Plenty of books talk about wartime jargon, but here's an actual dictionary exposing war propaganda usage and terms in Battlebabble: Selling War In America. Soldiers and civilians alike will find it's a-z reference allows for quick look-up of terms and definitions - but it's much more than just a one-paragraph dictionary: in-depth coverage often takes up several pages to thoroughly explain history, jargon, and approaches to selling war in the media and to the public."
3,It OK.,"It is interesting partly because of its age and style, and partly because it has some good ideas that need reviewing now and then. I don't think you will find anything particularly new in the book, and the authors authoritative style is somewhat off-putting, but it is still a good read for the price."
5,Rolling on the floor!,I was trapped inside the house and decided to play with my kindle fire prime time. I have become a fan of Betty White so I thought why not????? Best move ever! Each character has their own merit and the one liners with exchanged looks are priceless. My daughter did not get all of the lines and when I explained she said.......OH MOM! Love it!
4,Good Contrasts,A fun look through sit-com eyes of middle America vs. the glitterati of Los Angeles. Fun characters with some plausible situations and some only on TV situations.
4,Fun,"I wish I had friends like these. The actors are so in character and love to watch this sitcom whenever I can. Naughty, nice adult girls' entertainment."
5,Love it,Great tv show. I can't get enough of this show. DVD is in tip top shape and will be ordering more seasons in the future.
4,the logic of every time i die,"this band is great, ferret records has a knack for putting out kickass cds by great bands and this definatley one of them. good metalcore, similiar to norma jean (former luti-kriss) and converge (although not as chaotic) Every Time I Die display ten tracks of raw hard/metalcore in about 30 minutes, and leave you wanting more. the duel guitars work well together, and the drums are amazing. the sound quality isn't excellent but its good enough to rock out too. i would recomend this cd to anyone who likes from autumn to ashes, norma jean, converge, or atreyu"
5,Cool,"the cd is good but their live shows are even better. They are playin today in Buffalo NY. Which is cool cuz that's where they are from and everyone goes nuts. I've seen etid a few times, they rule.Get this.Plus they're not sXe so they won't want to kick your ... for smokin' a cigarette."
4,"Hillary was right!! (abount the ""right-wing"" conspiracy)","While i do find faults with this book, it is a must to those who are opened minded enought to want to know the truth about our latest long national nightmare. Conservatives were so bitter about losing to Clinton in 92 that they spent miilions of theirs and our money to try to bring down a President. When they couldn't do that, they decided to steal one and appoint GW Bush as Commander in Chief.I always had a sense that Brock was a decent person even when he was destroying lives w/ his pen. Now I see what was really up.Read it please!"
3,Another Title Would Have Been More Accurate,"This book would have been better titled: ""Blinded by Myself."" Brock himself talks about the number of times he chose to look the other way when ""the Right"" was doing things that bothered or offended him. I didn't get any sense that anyone was trying to pull the wool over his eyes. His blindness seems to be of his own creation. I think he knows that and is angry about it. And, as well he should. Unfortunately, he has misdirected his anger and has lashed out at people and ideas rather than engaging in retrospection and holding himself responsible for the fact that he did not see clearly for so many years. This book would have been more credible had he done so."
4,Much Needed Contribution,"This book provides a much needed contribution in refuting the falsehoods spread by the so-called ""Christian"" Right. It is a good companion to a wonderful new book titled Real Prophecy Unveiled: Why the Christ Will Not Come Again, And Why the Religious Right Is Wrong, by Joseph J. Adamson. And another good book is A Pilgrim's Path: Freemasonry and the Religious Right, by John J. Robinson. Thank God for books like these, because they shed light in a world made dark by ""religious"" bigotry, hypocrisy, and aggression. They give me faith that the humble and meek shall inherit the earth after all."
1,Conservative....YEAH RIGHT,"... Not only does this book lack in any good reason for being Liberal it is poorly written, boring and sometimes hard to understand who this person is talking about. I'd pass on this book if given another chance...."
1,Another load of hogwash from a proven dissembler,"Brock is right...his behavior in the past was sleazy...and continues to be. This man clearly has no spine, a jellyfish in the tide of life who will change his entire persona on a whim. He has absolutely NOTHING interesting to say in this text (that is, anything that he most likely did not invent)."
4,Vast Right Wing Conspiracy,"This books details the vast right wing conspiracy that anybody who followed politics in the nineties knew about. Especially accurate is Brock's description of the nasty, hateful, condescending attitude of the right. The book provides an inside look at the lies, character assassination, and deceit of the Republican Party, which Brock notes has lost any moral authority. A very interesting book that shows how corrupt the conservative movement has become."
4,Brock - Clears his conscience and exposes the right,Although his excuses for falling for the far right are somewhat lax - He was right on target - you'll see the far right hate machine spring into action now -claiming he was in a mental institution and that he did it for his lover - dont believe itThese are the same tactics used by the Clinton hate machine-Brock was much like I was in 97 - I could not believe the hate mogering and the Starr Chamber tactics - The Nazis could not have carried off a better schemeI was sick to my stomach for the United StatesHow could sane people believe such liesRead this book not to reinforce your own beliefs but to see what hate can do to a cause - to a generation
1,"Book title should have been ""Say Anything""","Just saw Brock on TV getting his booked picked apart with facts, dates, witnesses etc...His responses of stammering, stuttering and silence spoke volumes.It all comes down to this: Either Paula Jones, Juannita Broaddrick, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey etc... are all lying, or Bill Clinton is.Since we all know that Clinton and Brock are both admitted liars, it's not too hard to figure out who's fibbing, even for the most synchophantic, myopic Clinton apologists.The knee-pad faction of the Democratic Party will swallow (no pun intended) this tripe hook, line and sinker but that's about it.Only the intellectually lazy still believe Clinton was Impeached only for his shenanigens with Lewinsky."
5,Finally!,"The right wing has run amuk in this country in the last two decades, branding everyone who doesn't agree with their particular brand of cruel conservatism a traitor to America. It always sounded kind of scary. Now we see why. The right wing has finally been exposed for being the loopy, wacky--and dangerous--nuts anyone with a conscience always suspected. I used to be a middle-to-right kind of guy, but these days not being a liberal means not fighting these guys. Everyone should read this book, and learn, and weep, and then fight!"
5,Nice and Comfy,"Shoes are nice and comfy. Took a few games to get them ""broken in"" but overall they fit very well and a great price too!"
1,disappointed,"The shoes seemed to be just what I wanted, but in the left shoe the front of the sole was not glued down so the inner sole was all bunched up and uncomfortable. Cannot recommend this product - besides the fact that I had to pay shipping both ways was not a good experience."
3,Kauai Trails,I honestly did not have time to use this book as much as I would have liked. I left the book with my friend who was staying longer on the island and she used the book and was quite pleased with the accuracy of the information provided.
3,A classic war movie,It is certainly not the greatest movie but it shows you a kind of movies that has been shot in the 40's and the 50's. The good one's and the bad ones. it is in black and white.
4,cool item,"This is part 2 of the 2-CD Bedtime story set from the U.K. Part 1 of course being the infamous and now rare storybook digipak. The first part features Secret mixes but this is the one with the Bedtime Story mixes. The disc itelf is quite beautiful with high quality ""shimmering"" purple graphics. The mixes can also be found on the U.S. release."
5,Junior's Remixes,"You can find Junior Vasquez's remixes on this CD and they are fabulous. The only time Madonna has ever performed this song live was at the Brit Awards in 1996 and she used Junior's version.This Cd also included the full length Orbital mix, the edit of which was used for an interlude on 2004's ""Re-Invention Tour""."
1,Mini Laser Level,"This is a cheap laser level, the operative level being CHEAP. I could not get it to work and had to return it. The 4 included batteries are odd balls and would be hard to replace. The screw bits are not necessary as everyone has these on a separate tool. It is an innovative concept. I wish I could find one that:1 -- Runs on AAA cells2 -- Does not include screw bits3 -- One that actualy works."
3,"Informative, but speculative","In many respects this is an excellent book. The author has a gift for explaining the subject's complexities with down-to-Earth analogies. However, he runs far afield of his primary subject(Greenland ice cores and the clues they offer to past climate change), though in all fairness his subtitle does hint at these excursions. The author provides much useful information on the interconnectedness of Earth systems and their feedbacks, but makes proclamations that are sometimes broad and sweeping, and unsupported by evidence presented in the book. To his credit, he correctly advises scientific caution in drawing conclusions from a limited, but growing data set. He also sounds the warning claxon on abrupt and human-induced climate change (but where is the evidence?) without resorting to pedantry. It is clear from this text that humankind needs to behave more responsibly with respect to our home, the Earth."
5,a masterpiece,"A book by a master of the field, a comprehensive reference for experts, yet a lucid guide for novices. This true delight to readers will become the standard citation in scientific papers in the next 20 years."
3,Stand is okay.,"The chillmat works fine, it's just like the standalone Targus chillmat I already had if you detach it from the stand. That is not the problem. I don't want to call the stand a problem, because it works. It just doesn't seem to work very well. It didn't seem to really raise it up that much or give me a good viewing angle at all. This was the whole point of buying it, so that's why I have to give it a mediocre review."
5,A Must for a Tintin Afficionado,"As a life-long Tintin fan (I always wanted to be just like him - and own a raincoat just like his), ""Tintin: The Complete Companion"" is a fantastic publication. I happened to come across it as I was reading about the new (and ill-conceived) Spielberg film version in the Wall Street Journal, where they had a long list of Tintin related books. Since I got the book, I have been re-reading my Tintin books, now armed with the fascinating background info provided by the book. It has certainly enriched my appreciation for the treasured episodes. I just ordered a second copy to send to my sister so she can do the same thing."
2,Tummy Problems,"I tried the vanilla and chocolate and both gave me diarrhea. The taste was tolerable, not wonderful. I wished it didn't make me sick."
1,It maybe new but it ain't improved,This product is nowhere like the kind sold in the can which is unavailable . It's thin even when shook and shook and shook. The taste doesn't even remotely taste of chocolate. Pass on this one.
3,A Rock and Roll Goddess In The Making,"In this, as all of her earlier recordings with Ike, it was obvious that Tina worked perfectly with the music, providing the right fevered pitch and get-down soul, gospel-drenched, screamin' blues-Mama.River Deep, Mountain High, once Phil Spector added his golden touch, proved, that the band had reached a new plateau. But it was just a step in the evolution of Tina.Sit back, prop up your feet, and put on these records. But don't expect to say seated long. Soon, Ike and Tina will have you on your feet, feeling the Spirit...of rock and roll, rhythm and blues...!"
4,a view from the end of the Cold War,"Levering wrote this 2nd edition in 1988. Little did he know that he was at the end of an era. The Cold War had only 1 more year to run. Inadvertently then, the book offers a synopsis of the entire war at its very end, without that end being anticipated.The description of the 1945-87 years is accurate, even with the extra hindsight some 20 years later, after documents were declassified on both sides. But today's reader might see an extra attraction in the book. It shows the American viewpoint at the very end, when glasnost was in the air, but also when the Soviet Union was expected to keep chugging along, and with it so too the war."
1,"Bad experience, Lesson learned","Never buy from thermite media, that should say it all, this company should be banned from selling. From what I am hearing on the internet after reviewing them, they seem to just take your money and leave I still havnt received my book yet although I know they took my money. I am very dissapointed and will never shop from thermite media ever again!"
5,Great addtion to holiday cd collection,This CD is a wonderful CD. It incorperates great musical composition as well as the light joyful spirit that only the muppets can bring. The CD gets you right in the spirit of Christmas. I suggest seeing the film also... so you can enjoy the music even more!
4,Though not her best it's pretty good,"I think some of the reviews below are overly harsh... I would give this book a B- to B grade. It's fun in its way. The settings (Arctic and Gilded Age New York) are interesting, and so are the characters. The premise is unique. There are some cliches (orpahned children and kindly housekeeper) but the story is suspenseful throughout. I did not mind the hero's harshness, given what the heroine had done I thought she was lucky he didn't sic the police on her. I enjoy a dark romance with lots of tension between the hero and heroine and this book had that. I did think that all the stuff with the painting at the end was predictable and silly. But overall I found this book entertaining. Not on the order of Lions & Lace, Fair is the Rose, or A Man to Slay Dragons, but still worth reading for McKinney fans."
1,Amateur Writing from an Old Pro,"Who wrote this book under McKinney's pseudonym? I can forgive boring characters, implausible plot and inconsistent story-line; any writer can go through a bad spell. But writer and editor both insult the reader with the unforgivably awful grammar! Please, pay attention to the meaning of lie vs. lay and further vs. farther; avoid split infinitives and study up on subjunctive mood; and for goodness sake! The case when using pronouns! I cringed when I read phrases such as ""between Betsy and I"" and ""It was her...."" Ick."
5,Do you enjoy wonderful things?,"It's hard to have a debut sound so innovative. Well this art/punky/indierockish foursome can make all songs completely loveable. You can't get enough of ade blackburn's voice. it's very different. ""the second line"" is a must-listen, darkly catchy.it's one of my favorite albums, and i can't see myself ever tiring of it!"
4,Good,"Got a definite weakness for VU-alikes. Interesting rhythym section -- the title track's my favorite so far, and I also like ""Distortions,"" which cops ""Pale Blue Eyes"" really well. I'm interested to hear what they'll do next."
2,Caveat Emptor,"""Internal Wrangler"" is a perfect illustration of the bad things that can happen when alternative music goes mainstream. In the old days (ie. pre-Nirvana), a band like Clinic would most likely be putting out 7-inch singles on its own label, at four or five bucks a pop. In such circumstances their sloppy, amateurish noise pop would be forgiveable, even endearing. However, at the price I paid for this CD I expect a little more -- things like production values, and actual songs, not half-baked doodlings. And if I can't have quality, then at least give me quantity: ""Internal Wrangler"" has only 13 tracks, half of them less than three minutes long, maybe 40 minutes of music all told.This is not to say it's a bad disc. But I couldn't enjoy it -- I felt too much like the guys in the band were playing a joke at my expense. The moral? ""Don't charge corporate-rock prices for something that sounds like you recorded it on a cheap 4-track in your basement""."
2,Why can't anyone come up with original music anymore?,"Anyone who enjoys the title track, ""Warning"" should check out the song ""Picture Book"" by the Kinks on their ""We Are the Village Green Preservation Society"" album. It's the *same* riff, give or take two notes. Give me a break. They barely even bothered to change keys. I liked Green Day, but Jesus, write a song that *hasn't* been written before! I know there's no market for originality and creativity today, but why not break the monotony instead of jumping on the bland-copyright-infringement-""musical""-trend?!"
1,why green day why???,"i never thought i would see the day.my favorite punk band has become pop.i loved kerplunk,slappy hours, and nimrod. i had mixed feelings about insomniac,but dookie was my favorite.when i heard minority on the radio i knew i had to get this cd.so i bought it,took it home, and put it in my cd player.i expected more cool punk tunes but all i heard was this god-awful pop music. since when is green day supposed to be soft?i know theyre maturing, but this sounds like a whole new band!hopefully soon they realize how good they once were.but right now, i have one word for you green day:SELLOUTS!"
2,The low point for a great band,"I don't know what exactly Green Day was thinking on this one- hey, let's make a lot of acoustic garbage after not putting out an album for 3 years! Yeah, good idea! If this record was any good, rock might not have gone to its current decrepid state over the past 4 years. But who am I to say. Back to Warning, it's the exact opposite of everything Green Day does well. Minority is one of about 3 good songs."
1,GREEN DAY ARE HORRIBLE,"GREEN DAY ARE TERRIBLE.DONT LISTEN TO THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS AS YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.BUY ANY ALBUM FROM THE WHO,PINK FLOYD OR LED ZEPPELIN INSTEAD."
2,not really worth your hard earned cash,"yeah ok so minority and warning are pretty good but the rest of the album isn't very good to be honest.i mean yeah its ok if you like that sort of thing but its not going to convert you or anything, save you money up and buyt something diffrent like brit rockers feeder, and their fourth album echo park."
2,One of the most disappointing cd's in a long time,"After hearing Green Day's first single on the radio from Warning, Minority, I was a bit worried about the cd. I decided to buy it anyway since Im a huge Green Day fan and it is by far, the worst Green Day album. It seems as if they are selling out, changing their sound to mainstream ska type music, with poppy melodies, that sound like they could have been released in the 50's. Macy Day Parade is a lame follow up to the great Time of Your Life and the majority of the songs just don't seem right. They've also lost their smart, yet funny lyrics from the Dookie days. The pluses, though, include th up-beat Warning and the traditional Deadbeat Holiday. Hopefuly their next cd goes back to the Dookie sound."
4,dowell,"This album rocks!! Green day has explored new melodies and played with new ideas, but have stayed true to their roots. They haven't ""sold out"" or pulled a Madonna. As the bad matures, note how their lyrics are filled with introspection and deeper ideas. Buy this one. Also, check out Nimrod and Dookie."
3,"""Warning""...A Good Title","I am truly a Green Day fan and on the first day it came out I went to the store to buy just like any hardcore fan probably would, and I expected it to be better than their previous album released in 1997:Nimrod and just about as good as their previous kick-ass albums like Dookie and Insomniac, not to mention Kerplunk. But as i popped the CD into my CD player I was rather dissapointed that it wasn't very much punk as their previuos albums. This CD is about a quarter punk(not even) and the rest is alternative which came as a piss-off to me and to my friend which was going to buy it as soon as he listend to my copy. Sure for all you alternative fans who don't know squat about Green day and have no clue why you are reading this review, than this is a must-buy, but for punk fans- I wouldn't really bother unless you listen to it and would like it(which I doubt)."
5,UNA OBRA MAESTRA,"Que se puede usar para calificar este CD?, no hay adjetivo. Es un excelente CD con ritmos variados que van desde neo-punk (Warning), música ""árabe"" (Misery), punk (Dead Beat Holiday, Church on Sunday, Minority), country (Hold On). Aunque este sea el más corto CD de Green Day, es el que tiene canciones más largas, se puede llegar a decir, el más Pop."
4,Green Day for the Masses -- But Not a Sellout,"Those who have at any time have classified Green Day as a ""Punk"" band were stretching the definition of that genre far beyond its initial intent. Green Day, is and always has been a cynical, beat-driven, high-speed -- and darn good -- Pop band. They are the perfect teenage angst band -- too fast for Top 40 (and thus fringe) and just acerbic enough to seem dangerous to your parents. ""Warning"" is all of these things except high speed. It is ""Dookie"" and ""Nimrod"" slowed down to a traditional pop pace. That doesn't make it bad, just different and more acessible to the masses. The songs ""Warning"" and ""Misery"" stand up among the band's best work. If you like Green Day's work in the past, you'll probably like this as well (but you can still moan about the pace to prove you're a purist). If you haven't been exposed to the band before, this is a good place to start."
5,Warning - the best so far.,"Although I have nearly the entire Green Day collection and they are all very good Warning has to be my all time favourite. The songs are much more melodic and there is more variety, class songs such as Minority, Warning and Misery are what makes this album such a success. This album is so far the best of Green Day's and is a must-have for anybody that likes Green Day or Rock/Indie/Punk. GET IT NOW or suffer the consequences!"
2,green day goes grunge,"I am a huge fan of green day and always have been, but this cd was an all time low for them. They tried a totally new sound, and it obviously didn't go over so well, all in my opinion, ofcourse. I say anything's worth a shot, but this wasn't exactly what they should have gone for. Good luck with your other long-time fans, Green Day! I still love the band, I was just dissapointed with the release."
2,What Is Going On Here?,"I bought this album the first day it came out, and the first thing i thought was..""A lot of fans are gonna hate this"" Not as many as I expected hated it, but atleast i am not the only one who thinks it sucks. A few people complained about Nimrod cuz it was softer, but I liked it, cuz the songs were GOOD. Warning is a letdown. What happened to the driving guitar distortion Billie loved to use on songs like ""Longview"" and ""Geek Stink Breath"" and other classics? Beats me, he must of lost his distortion pedal. The only songs worth listening to are Blood... and Minority. I suggest that any new fans should buy the albums in this order: Dookie, Nimrod, Insomniac, Kerplunk!, and 1039... then Warning. Hopefully someday they will get back to their punk/rock roots."
3,Disappointing,"After the creative peak of Nimrod, the boys are treading water with Warning. Not bad, but it doesn't have the initial impact of their other records. And all the critics are going mad for ""Macy's Day Parade""... it's a poor man's ""Good Riddance"" if you ask me. And the first single ""Minority"" is average at best (if it was on any of their other records it would have no hope of being a single). The record sounds good, but the songwriting is lacking and uninspired. Don't get me wrong... it's not horrible, but I expected a lot more from Green Day."
2,Not the Best (according to me),"Eh, this CD is definitely not one of my favorites. Some of the songs like 'Church on Sunday', 'Minority', and 'Macy's Day Parade' are pretty good, but most of the songs I don't even listen to when the chance comes that I actually listen to the CD. I bought this CD after I heard 'Minority', and I do really like this song, but the CD isn't worth getting just for that. At least according to me it's not. But hey, who knows, maybe by some chance you'll like the CD! But anywho, this is what I thought of it."
3,"Not Green Days best, but not the worst.","This album is pretty good. I bought this because of Minority, Church on Sunday, and Fashion Victim. I've heard those songs, and I loved them, so I decided to buy this album. I was going to buy Isomniac, but I couldn't find it anywhere, so I got this. Well, only 7 of the songs, out of 12, were any good. I mean, the other 5 were crap. This album seemed rushed. The only good songs were Warning, Blood Sex and Booze, Church on SUnday, Fashion Victim, Castaway, Waiting, and Minority. The other songs were no good. They were rushed, extremely slow, or repeditive. If I were you, I'd download those songs off of iTunes, and save some cash. If you want to buy a full CD, buy Dookie, Isomniac, or Nimrod. They have better songs. But the good songs on this CD are great."
4,Different but Great,"The melodies are what always made Green Day special. Billie Joe could write a helluva song. He still does. On this album, new instruments and sounds are used, but Green Day is still there. The electric guitar has been replaced mostly with an acoustic yet the songs where Green Day has wanted to make it sound punk, they succeed. Things work out well even with the more experimental songs, such as Misery. Green Day have made yet another catchy, fun, and great album."
1,GREEN DAY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Green day are one of the worst and lousiest band of all times.Their music is lame,stupid,pathetic and they are just another TEEN POP BAND with guitars.THEY ARE NOT PUNK ROCKGREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!GREEN DAY SUCKS!I Would suggest you to get these albums insteadTHE WALL-PINK FLOYDLOVE AT FIRST STING-THE SCORPIONSSTRANGERS IN THE NIGHT-UFOLIVE AT FILLMORE EAST-TEN YEARS AFTERBOSTON-BOSTONBRITISH STEEL-JUDAS PRIESTVINCEBUS ERUPTUM-BLUE CHEERRAW SIENNA-SAVOY BROWNAQUALUNG-JETHRO TULLLET THERE BE ROCK-AC/DCNOT FRAGILE-BACHMAN TURNER OVERDRIVEHOLY DIVER-DIO.GREEN DAY SUCK,DONT BUY ANY OF THEIR ALBUMS."
1,this is horrible,"i was expecting something like dookie, i mean every where i heard this cd was supposed to be their best yet, i mean it took them 3 damn years for god sake, and then i turn this thing on expecting something half decent and its all horrible acoustic crap. i think that billy joe lost his distortion pedal or something, i mean what happened to the punk/rock? just listen to the song misery, that has got to be the worst song ever written, this whole cd sounds like something some pop band would write, if you are going to take 3 years to make a cd at least make it half way decent."
2,Going the way of the buffalo,Greenday was one of the first punk bands to break into the main streem and has been populat ever since. I am a hige green day fan but this is thier worst work. They are toning down thier lyrics thier music is going soft. Whether this is because they are getting older have families or fame has finaly gotten to them. The one song that saves this cd from getting one review is the song minority. This song should become a punk anthem. Unfortunately this one song cannot carry the whole cd. The other songs while easy beats to get into do not sound anything like Nimrod or Dookie thier best cd. If they are switching genres then more power to them but as a punk band they are no longer. If possibly buy the single don't waste your money on the other stuff on this cd. Hopefully if they make another cd it will be the old school type that Green Day fans love them for.
3,transition cd,Green Day fans were disappointed with this cd when it came out. It had a few radio hits like Minority and Warning but the majority of the music is a departure from what we all loved about Green Day's sound. Their sound is less fast paced punk and more solemn and slower and more serious. It marks their transition to their current sound of American Idiot. If you like later Green Day you'll like this but early Green Day fans might not. If you don't already have them go get Dookie and Insomniac as these are their best works BY FAR.
2,"uggggghhhhhhhhhh, don't say a word about them. only 2 good songs.","I'm so sick of people talking about Green Day. They are so overrated for some reason, Warning only has too great songs in WARNING, AND MINORITY. rest of it is boring even American Idiotis over!!!! I'm sick of this band, be sick of them too, Waiting for a Girl Like You.PS. Waiting for a Girl Like You may like this band better than me. So go buy it for her........"
4,Green Day To A New Beat,"When I first heard the cd I thought , geez Green Day has gone soft! But when you listen to the whole cd you realize they haven't gone soft but grown up. They have improved lyrically and rhythmically. In my opinion, an altogether good cd. The cd has the rare quality these days of being able to listen to every song without changing around. So to all new green day fans this is a great cd but check out the old ones too especially Dookie and to all hardcore Green Day fans, give it a chance, you'll like it!"
4,What can you say about a bracket,"This bracket is for wall mounting or stacking. Because the Linksys products are rounded on top, they're hard to stack or sit other items on top - like a small cable modem for instance. And of course Linksys makes their home/home office products in 2 different sizes also. So I purchased the bracket so I could sit my cable modem on top of my stack of Linksys 16-port switch and wireless router. Unlike one of the reviews indicated, I did get an instruction sheet in the box that illustrates both wall-mounting and stacking applications.My only complaint, like others, is the fact that you have to purchase 10, even if you just want 1. So, if anyone wants to purchase one, email me and we can make a deal on the 9 I have left. I'll sell them individually."
5,Draft inducer blower motor for '92 Janitrol (Goodman) gas furnace,"I was so happy to find the draft inducer blower motor for my residential Janitrol gas furnace at a good price. Internal design of shipping container needs to be improved so that the assembly doesn't move around during shipment and damage mounting flanges. Everything else was great. Fair price and shipping charges, arrived quickly."
2,DIABOLIQUE,"I had been wanting this movie in my collection for a long time and I was pretty disappointed when at last I was able to procure it from Amazon. It is not the film but its print that leaves a lot to be desired. It,definitely, is NOT AN ""A-ONE"" print and one tends to see the haziness/lack of contrast in the disk. I will now try to procure this movie from other source as the film is a very good one (good suspense, good thrill, good stuff altogether)and I want it in my own personal library. This product, however, -- NO VALUE FOR MONEY."
5,The best new country band on the market,"I know most people have never heard of these guys. However if you want country music the way country music is supposed to be played buy this album. The band hails from Lubock Texas the same place Waylon and Buddy Holly came from. If any band deserves more airplay it's these guys. I enjoy every song on this cd I picked it up after a show I saw them do at the Stillwater Tap Room in Augusta GA. I enjoy ever song on this album but my Favorites are ""Sleeply engine"" ""Sharp Left Hook"" and ""So Young."" I wish the music esecutives at nashville would sing more music like this so that those of us who enjoy Country music not ""80's rock with a cowboy hat"" could listen to stuff like this."
4,not your typical aerobic workout tape,"I love Kathy Kaehler's videos so much, I bought other tapes choreographed by her (Cyndy Crawford and Claudia Shiffer). She is just perfect to workout with. Her voice is soothing and personable, that you feel like she's right there training you. If you're looking for a full body workout, her it is....oh, except she doesn't work on the abs. Her tape is not a typical aerobic workout but more so she does sets and repetitions; you don't feel like you're out of breathe by the end of the tape. Also, she is such an inspiration I have read her ""Real World Fitness"" book. Its a good motivation to keep up with those days you feel like you're not happy with yourself. I want more Kathy Kahaeler books and exercise tapes!"
5,Milwaukee 1610-1 Super Hole Shooter - Right tool for the job!,"If you need to cut holes using hole saws, this is the tool for you. I often have to use a 4"" hole saw on my job. I ruined two high speed drills before I learned that you must keep the RPM's up to prevent damage to the drill--the Milwaukee 1610-1 is geared to run at low RPM's but it has the power to maintain them. I have one on each of my service vans."
3,Mackey knows the myths; see Stevenson for verifiable history,"Mackey's book does a good job of collecting Freemasonry's powerful myths in one place, and that makes it a worthwhile read. The language may strike some as archaic, but it's still quite readable.For those who are looking for this remarkable movement's verifiable origins, I recommend David Stevenson's excellent study, ""The Origins of Freemasonry: Scotland's Century, 1590-1710"". Stevenson teaches history at the University of St. Andrews, and has carefully examined the surviving records of the world's earliest known masonic lodges. In ""Scotland's Century"", he traces the beginnings of modern Freemasonry to the operative masonic lodges of Scotland in the early 1600s, about a century before the earliest known English lodges."
4,Worth reading,This is a wonderfully written book. May be difficult for some readers as some parts are in Old English. Keep in mind that Mackey is discussing 'legend' not known fact.
2,Don't read this one,"At first the book is interesting and will keep you reading, but it is to technical in the explanation of the law for the paints, that is really boring, and at the end, is like you never read this book, you will have absolutely nothing, everybody did what he wants no matter if it was against the law, and everybody win, could be that possible?"
5,the cool world...true look at life in america's ghetto,"i read this book 30 freaking years ago.its still an important part of my mind.it gave me a look into the ghetto that was all around me as i grew up in a working classcommunity that effectively exclude persons of color.thank you and ""good night"".troll."
2,"Support Ipad, PC and Mac ONLY!","I take Trigonometry course and my instructor required this book. It's alway cheaper by renting an kindle version of the book than buying a real one and then sell it back. The reason why I give this 2 out of 5 because it ONLY supports Ipad, Mac and PC, which means the student who have an android tablet and Kindle Fire like me cannot access it in class; or I have to bring my old model laptop, double heavier and easy run out of the battery, to class, just in order to use the book. And i'm sure that I'm not gonna do that cuz I ride a bike, not a car.P/s: If it lets me use thru my android tablet, I'll give it 4 stars: I buy this book cuz my instructor often picks some problems to solve to practice. It's really weird when everybody working and you do nothing. I know almost the material before the course so the content is not a big deal for me. Just piss off cuz exclusive Ipad is ridiculous!"
3,Phil goes solo,"Phil Lynott was a genius songwriter, but on this album it's sounds too much as if he's trying to keep up with what was making the pop-charts at the time.There is none of Lizzy's great guitars or sound, even though ""the boys"" make guest appearences, the guitars are non-existent. I guess that's why it was a solo-album.Two songs that makes the album worth buying is ""King's Call"" with Mark Knophler, who plays beautifully as usual ( it also sounds very ""Dire Straits"") and the reggae song ""Solo in Soho"", that song works even though it's not what you'd expect. ""Dear Miss Lonely Hearts"" and ""A Child's Lullaby"" are not bad. The rest is pretty hard to sit through with the tired ""hit"" sounds and electronic dance songs .Unlike most of Thin Lizzy's material, most of this sounds dated . But this must have been Phil's chance to try things that he could never try in Lizzy and thank god it didn't happen often."
5,Best DVD on cooking EVER for busy people who want to be healthy,"Jeff Novick's Fast Food DVD is simply AWESOME!!! I got it because I follow the McDougall plan and I needed fast and easy ways to make on-plan meals. This DVD MORE than delivers--to the point where I almost never maky anything BUT ""Fast Food"" meals anymore. What's great is that there are really no recipes--once you learn the basics, you can create whatever you like with whatever you have on hand. I can toss a meal together in 10 minutes no matter what b/c I always keep canned no-salt-added beans and tomatoes, rice, and frozen veggies on hand. It really is that easy.Jeff's Longevity Soup is my favorite ""recipe."" I've never made it the same way twice and I've never not completely enjoyed what I made. I make huge vats of it and then eat it for a solid week.I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. It really is that useful!"
1,I want my money back! Seriously.,"In this video Jeff takes to hours of your life away to talk down to you about how to open cans & cut bags. There are less than 10 recipes with names like: Pasta Primavera! ( yes, he uses the exclamation point. No that doesn't make it taste better or more creative.) or Mexican Fiesta. Really? Here, let me save you $24: dump a can of tomatoes, a can of beans, a bag of frozen veggies and some spices in a pot and serve it over brown rice or wheat pasta and you have made ALL of the recipes in this video. Oh, you want variety? Just change the types of veggies, beans and spices and supposedly you have a whole new meal! Genius, right?? Ya, I didn't think so either. Really really disapointed. Total waste of money."
5,The best and clearest guitar book I own!!!,This book simply gives you what you need to know. It lets you climb up and down the frettboard with confidence. Teaches the tricks pros know.
4,excellent,"Found it in the library and had to buy my own. I'm a novice wanting to learn music theory, particularly blues, and this book offers the clearest presentation of music theory for the guitar that I have yet encountered."
2,Not much new,"I love Buddy and Julie Miller, but this cd has mostly already released songs. I probably should have checked but online it's hard to see the playlist. If you don't have all their other cds, this would be great. If you do, it's repetitive."
3,Editing videos from these DVD's is MAJOR pain,"I love the camera and it takes fantastic images...but editing your video's is virtually impossible since you cannot plug a firewire or USD cable into the unit, copy it to your PC and just ""Edit"". You need to convert the timing. MAOR MAJOR MAJOR pain.This is my 3rd SONY handycam, and I am seriously pissed at this dumb move. I use Windows XP Service Service Pack 2. I see others had some problem with this camera.Do not buy it if you plan on editing videos."
5,WELL WORTH YOUR TIME !,"THIS IS QUITE A FINE CD THAT HAS NOW BECOME A DIFINATIVE CD TO HAVE IF YOU ARE A LOVER OF ELECTRONICA MUSIC. MY FAVOURITE TRACKS ARE ""MR. VAIN"" AND ""GOT TO GET IT"" BUT, I LOVE ALL THE REST OF THEM. I ALSO SUGGEST : BANANARAMA-""ULTRA VIOLET"", TECHNOTRONIC-""RECALL"", DEAD OR ALIVE-""NUKLEOPATRA"", LIVIN' JOY-""DON'T STOP MOVIN'"", TKA-""FOREVER""& ANGELINA-""VEN A MI {COME TO ME}"". THIS CD IS GREAT FOR PARTIES AND DEEJAYING. ONE OF THE FINEST TECHNO ALBUMS EVER MADE: A++++++. A MUST FOR YOUR DANCE MUSIC COLLECTION. GET YOUR COPY OF ""SERENITY"" TODAY. SIGNED... MUSIC FAN."
5,It just rocks!,"Culture Beat is simply the best Dance group ever, they've inspired a lot of other groups, but no one has equaled their talent yet!"
2,I must have the lemon edition,"The stapler I bought consistently jams, it won't take a full ""clip"" of arrow staples like all the othe guns, I think that the jamming outweighs the easier action, also, there's alot of plastic on the outside that's sure to break if and when I drop it. I expect a tool to work when I reach for it, and consistent jamming far outweighs any benefit from easier handle squeezing. As a carpenter, I think this tool is inferior to the arrow t-50 hand stapler."
1,Total waste of money!,"What a waste! Since 99% of the recipes are from test kitchens rather than famous people, the title is misleading, if not false advertising. Although it does contain many recipes from famous women, there are countless celebrity cookbooks and even online sites -- and the good ones all include something from the celeb telling why that particular recipe is special to them. This book doesn't even bother to do that. Moreover, the print is very small (and green). I ordered this along with _Mom's Secret Recipe File_ -- which was cheaper and is far superior. Celebrity cookbooks are great fun; this just doesn't happen to be one of the good ones. Although I own well over a thousand cookbooks, I'm returning this one. A total waste of money!"
3,Looks pretty,This salad bowl looks really pretty and sturdy. I can't wait to use it and see how well it will work.
5,freebie,The 6016 sheet sander was sent free with a 3 1/2 HP Router. I already have an excellent Bosch sander and thought I did not need another but the price was right. I find this to be better than the Bosch. I especially like it because I can use Cheaper Sheet paper split into quarters. My other requires more expensive velcro backed paper. This is the first one I reach for.
5,Excellent!,Harkens back to the day of the 1st Ed. DMG. Far better than it's 2nd counterpart. If you are a DM in the new 3rd Edition game then you need this book.
5,Better than the old one...,"well, this book kills the 2nd edition version. the artwork is incredible. the new rules are much better than the old varities. I really do like the fact that a natural 20 is only a threat, and not a critical hit. instant kills are a nice addition. however, i would like to know why the artifact section is lacking."
4,Mastering the world of Imagination,"The Dungeon Masters Guide is one of those books that you must have to complete the Players Handbook.The book goes into further information on the game world mechanics, making NPC's, magic items, spells and prestige classes.The reason why I give this book a 4/5 is due to the fact, that the content you would need could be summed up in about 30 pages, compared to the full book content. Its a must buy because you have to have it to complete missing holes in the Players Handbook; otherwise the book would have no purpose, but it was well done in one respect for the new aged Dungeon Masters who might rely off of its generation tables."
2,"Love Joey Hill, really didn't like this book.","This reads like Joey Hill might have written it as a teenager. The characters aren't particularly well drawn, or interesting. I found the male lead to be downright unlikeable. Their island adventure is both bland, and somehow ridiculous. The premise, that this ultra alpha dominant guy would want to keep his relationships non-physical, is entirely out of character for him, and men in general.Not good."
1,Design is Dangerous,"If you ever have used a staple gun before, use extreme caution with this one, for it is designed with the handle at an angle which is opposite all other staplers I have ever seen or used and your memory may get you in trouble. While using it yesterday, I grabbed for it without looking and applied a staple directly into the little finger of my left hand because,yes, I was holding it backwards. Hopefully no damage was done but my pinky on my left hand ended up purple around the joint that one end of the staple entered and almost twice as big as my pinky on my right hand. I've always hated the design but never had an accident until yesterday. I was so upset I came here to write a review and found I am not the only one who has had this happen to them! You need to be very conscious about what you are doing when you use this tool. Now I know to never let my kids or wife use it. If you are shopping for a staple gun, get something else."
1,"If you're looking at this staple gun, move on","This staple gun never worked correctly, jammed when it did, and eventually stopped working after only less than 12 uses. I would not recommend buying this unit."
1,D A N G E R,"Hi, this morning I shot a staple flush into the palm of my hand, nice. This is a ver unsafe staple gun due to fact the staples come out the opposite end we are use to. I am not an amature at using hand tools (32) years old. This product should have a class action lawsuite id all these people im reading about are having problems like myself."
3,Assembly Required!,"When i first got this, i was very excited. I had a big project stapling a bunch of vinyl over some high density foam. I have one of the old style staplers but it almost always left some of the staple sticking out. I needed a change.I opened the case grabbed the stapler and loaded it up. Everything good so far.Thats where things went wrong. My first staple was good. On the second staple it jammed up. I pulled on the little rod for reloading and a staple shot past my head. (glad i wear safety glasses).I then pushed it back in and it jammed on the first one. every once in awhile i could get it to staple. Finally i decided to take it apart. when i started to take the side screws off, i noticed they were loose. I tighted these up real good and low and behold it worked pretty good. Still jams once in awhile but dont they all?I now like it, but will keep my eyes out for a better one."
5,Why should the kids have all the fun?,"I picked up a box of Ho-Ho's on a whim while I was grocery shopping. Later that day, I grabbed one for a snack and WOW! I have forgotten how wonderfully creamy and delicous these little treats are! Very satisfying and at a very good price. Cheers to all. Pamela."
4,Love it but it's big.,"I've worn this watch almost every day for 3 years. I get a lot of compliments on it, but I should say it is a larger watch for a woman which may be a turn off to some. Combine that with the shiny face and band and it is noticeable. It is elegant looking but the style is simple enough that it can be worn with casual wear in my view. One thing it does is catch the light like any mirror would so sometimes it is startling (but comes in handy if you need to surreptitiously check your makeup!)Not for everyone but if you don't mind a big flashy watch, you'll love it."
2,Doesn't even come close to Deliverance,"The story is cheap, but is reasonally well written. It titilates with hard sex and sometimes unbelievable violence. There is no heart and soul in this, no resonation. By the end you feel sleezy, like you've been reading Hustler. Empty, vulgar thrills."
1,I couldn't put it down... fast enough!,"It's not the content of this book that makes it so hard to read; it's the way it's presented. The writing doesn't flow at all. The spelling errors and typos are bad enough, but the author constantly offers her own sarcastic opinions about the information she's presenting. It's not entertaining; it's embarrassing. The writing style is more suited to a series of magazine pieces than to a book. There is also a lack of insight into the subject himself. At the risk of sounding like I bought the book just for the dirt, one of the things I was most curious about was why Michael had his affair with Nurit Wilde. The topic was barely touched upon. I wanted to know what makes Michael Nesmith tick. I don't know any more now than I did before I read (what I could of) this book."
2,Not for Nez fans,"I am not a fan of this book. I am a Nez fan and have been for some time, and I was appalled by the way he was presented in this book. Granted, he is not perfect, none of us are, but a person who claims to be his fan writes a book like this about him?? I wouldn't write a book like this about my worst enemy. It had a few clever anecdotes, some interesting information, etc. but I do not feel it gave an accurate portrayal of Mike/Nez. I wouldn't reccomend reading it if you're a fan."
2,"nice bra, not the best fit","This can be a very comfortable bra but if you are full busted, you will need to go up a size around or it bunches up."
3,"The fit is snug, even at one size larger","The construction is good and the material is nice, but the fit is uncomfortably snug even at one size too large. Amazon had a good price, I was able to take advantage of super saving shipping, and if it was true to size I would be very happy with it."
2,Sized very small,"The size is about 2"" smaller around the chest and the cup size is also small. I'll just say my cup runneth over!"
3,Way too small for size on label.,"The product was well made. However, it was way to small. I wear a 42D in a regular bra but this size in this leisure bra was too small. Ordered a 46 and it is still was too small. I don't know who is sewing these up but I feel they are paying attention to sizes."
2,Crosley Traveler,"Not sure if it's the player i got, but i have to pinch the middle piece to fit any record on. It's a huge hassle and makes it very hard to change each record. The on/off switch seems super flimsy, like it will break each time i turn it on/off manually, so I usually let the record run to the end before changing. Since mine was used it didn't come with the manual (which when looking up online isn't helpful anyway) so I have no idea how the stacking part works... once the record is on the sound is fine. I just wish it was more easy to operate."
1,Anything but this,"This book is required for a class I am currently taking, and like most Course Technology books it's horrible. If you read the book cover to cover you might get something out of it, but if you forget how to do something forget it. Doing labs and studying for tests I find myself using the Macromedia help and other online sources rather than this book. It says its user level is ""intermediate"" but it has a lot of basic content. It looks pretty with all of the (expensive) colors and graphics, but the content is actually very lame.Greetz Purdue students/grads!"
3,It may be classic trash . . .,". . . but it's still trash. I would have enjoyed the book more, because I have to admit, Robbins is a great story teller, but it seemed to be the same thing over and over again--business deal, gratuitous sex scene, business deal, gratuitous sex scene. The Max Sand/Nevada Smith story line, at least, was different, but westerns aren't my genre. It's a good enough book for what it sets out to do (on that score, I'd give it four stars), but in the end, it was all just too repetitive. Guess I'm getting a little more highbrow in my old age!"
1,Whats with the price?,"Giving this a 1 just because the price makes this a terrible value. I got the regular dvd of this for $10, is the extra resolution worth this much more?"
2,Nice looking - Terrible sounding,"Being a ex- Bay Area fan of SO many years I came across this video on Pallaidia and it looked good. BUT (and it's a HUGE BUT!) it sounds like a never-ending Neil Schon solo - nearly straight through the entire three hours. While the new lead singer has very ""Perry-esque"" vocals, it's not the Journey I remember. Too bad too, because they were one of Bill Graham's greatest bands. Hope Bill wasn't watching from on high! Don't bother."
2,Bad Sound,"I love watching concert Blurays and was excited about this Journey Concert, When I played it, all the different sound set-ups sounded the same, and was very disappointing. For this disc being at a higher price, the sound quality was not good."
4,Good quality for a good price,"This was one of the cheaper movie packs I have ever paid for, but that does not mean that these two movies are terrible, by any means.While neither of these movies are particularly enthralling by themselves, together at a low price, they are quite a tandem to add to your comedy/drama collection. Starsky and Hutch is one of the better remakes on old tv shows/films in recent history, and the Big Bounce is a good film version of the Elmore Leonard book, Get Shorty."
4,A catalog of spells,"Compiled from the pages of Dragon magazine and a host of other sources, the sheer volume of spells in this book make it worth getting. No magic items. No new prestige classes. No new classes. Just spells. What little we get for an appendix lists the various classes and what spells they get in the book and some minor clarifications on some things. If you play any sort of spellcaster in D&D, this book is food for thought. Literally."
4,Best suppliment in a long time.,After a few years of mediocre game suppliments WOTC was come out with a compilation of spells from several sources. It is well put together and very useful. Many items have been fixed and steamlined for more efficient play. This is a must have for DM's.
5,jdubuc,"Recently my mother suffered a severe brain anuerism and stroke. She was unconscious for over a week and spent 27 days in the SCU. She was very young and this experience was very tramatic. Crimmins does a tremendous job to explain the oddities of TBI and name them without ever making you feel like you are reading a medical novel. By reading this story, I have been able to cope with confabulation and many other behaviours that TBI patients exhibit, that would have been shocking before reading this book. It is a truely amazing story as all recoveries from TBI are. I would hightly recommend this book to anyone dealing with any form of TBI."
2,Good thing I read French,"Everything indicated I was going to receive an English translation but since it is an old book I had a sneaking suspicion that it might be in French. It certainly is and idiomatic French that makes translation interesting. It is also black and white. While not up to the standard one expects of Tintin books, it is an amusing collectors item."
1,Racist Depiction of Africans Disappointing,My children are avid collectors of Tin Tin stories. I was shocked to open this book and read sections of it. Please take caution in ordering this material. The depictions of Africans are Colonial and considered extremely racist.
3,This is the edited version!!,"The book is not faithful to the first colored edition as it is supposed to be. This is the edited version where the exploding Rhino was replaced with more P.C. drawings. What is the point of this edition if they are not going to give us the original version even if it is considered by some to be crude or immaturish??And yes, the exploding rhino was featured in the very first colored edition, not just the B/W one as some would believe."
5,"An excellent, reader-friendly guide for learning Spanish","I want to learn Spanish because my daughter-in-law is from Guadalajara. I also want to learn the language because I find it useful to know in everyday life. I've purchased many books to help me get started. Bill Harvey's Spanish for Gringos Level Two is one of the two best. (The other is The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Spanish). Harvey's book is fun to use and provides an excellent framework to build on. He does a supurb job ""paso por paso"" (step by step) of making the learning process easy for us ""gringos."" At its affordable price this book is an excellent value."
4,A great re-discovery,"We originally bought this Tomy Big Loader toy for our son when he was small (over 30 years ago) and he loved it. I remember what fun he & I had playing with it, so I looked for it online as a Christmas gift for my grandson this year and was delighted to see it was still available. Now my son is getting to re-live his fond childhood memories and create new ones with his son, playing with this unique toy. Does it get any better than this?"
4,Grandson is thrilled!,"he enjoys playing with this toy with his father. Moving stuff , dumping stuff, etc. It assembles easily and safely."
3,Pretty Good,"I like products like these and it was an absolute fun to watch it operate. A few things I noted are:1. The quality of the plastic. It was quite okay, but for the price, I think it should have been more better.2. I noticed that the set should be assembled on a really firm surface. A carpet floor is an enemy.Over all I like the fun part of the product."
1,Horrible toy!,"This toy was almost impossible to put together, then none of the parts really work the way it shows. Very cheaply made! It's already in the garage sale pile!"
4,Great guide on Springers,"The English Springer Spaniel is my second favorite spaniel.. the first one being the COCKER SPANIEL. It helps you a lot about your Springer, and it has nice pics on products, dogs, and many more! I like the glossy pictures and this is a must for any Springer owner."
4,half the price at home depot,this box is half the pric at HD this is not a good value unless u dont have a HD in tour town.FYI
2,Not a bad movie(if you can get past the fact that Dillon aint Dillon),"The movie in and of itself aint bad as they say it is if you can only get past the fact that everyone is pretty much in character except the most important person and that would be Dillon. He has absolutely no Irish about him that we come to know and love in the books. Not even an accent,like I said everyone else in the movie is pretty much in character. As far as the book compared to the movie from the little bit I've seen the principle and the concept is there it may have deviated a little bit.I couldn't finish it because like I said Dillon aint DillonSkip this as it is a total let down to hardcore fans like myself. Its more of a collectors item than anything. Casual fans may like this movie. I have mixed feelings about it but most of them are negative."
5,The Funniest TV Series I've Ever Seen,"I did not have cable TV as a child, and Mystery Science Theater 3000 is a hilarious show I missed out on because of this. Fortunately, because of our great technology, I can catch all the episodes now. My husband introduced me to the series and I'm hooked! I've watched The Final Sacrifice, Santa Claus, and The Zombie episode, and they kept me laughing throughout. People with small children can watch them, since there's no offensive material in the shows. One caveat: Although the series is very funny, a lot of the jokes won't make a lot of sense to people younger than 30, since it's a rather generational show, like Robot Chicken."
4,Good for the price,The muffler was awesome looking when i got it. I own a 2002 grand am 2.2l ecotec.it doesn't do alot sound wise. I cut my muffler off thats what gave my car the deep tone which was awesome. but the new muffler deepened that tone. overall it is a good buy for the money.
1,The sob stories of fools,"Capitalism requires choices. Getting to the top of the business world might leave you less time to spend with your family. Living in a beautiful home might leave you with insufficient retirement savings. This book trots out a steady supply of whiners who aren't happy with the choices they have made, and uses their unhappiness as a bludgeon against capitalism.The green grass on the other side of the fence is Marxism. Climb over if you like. At least you won't have any of those nasty choices to make."
3,Soft but cheaply made,Good service from the vendor but the product was cheaply made. I should have bought the more expensive version.
1,uncomfortable,"It feels too stiff and tight, very uncomfortable. It's a good idea but the fabric used needs to be soft and stretchy not like this stuff."
5,Great Xmas Gift,Turtle Fur is AWESOME. I bought one of these a couple years back and have done skiing in them all the way down to -15 wind chills. I don't think there is a better way to keep the neck warm than a heavy duty seamless scarf with no extra strands hanging that take up unnecessary space. I liked them so much that I got one for every member in my family. You get a lot of bang for your buck with these. Good luck taking it off without messing up your hair though ;)
4,Nice New World,"I am always on the look-out for new planets, new charachters and new stories from Anne McCaffrey. I enjoyed this book very much. It must be difficult to create new worlds when you have lived so long on another; in Ms. McCaffrey's case, it must be hard to leave Pern. She is one of my favorite fansasy writters, and this book is one of the reasons why: all her characters are not the same. These are different and fresh. Good book."
1,Stardust,"Maroon Killashandra on Doona, have her meet an even more empathic and supportive Sean Shongili, extract all suspense and danger, and you'll have _Nimisha's Ship_. Unlike memorable McCaffrey heroines of yore, Nimisha has no need to grow and change, as she's brilliant, beautiful, poised, and powerful from the early pages. Even being marooned on a planet with defeated exploratory teams barely ruffles her hair or mars her manicure. It's a good thing the early settlers of Pern did not have Nimisha's ship-design skills, as they would have developed a high technological civilization in approximately 25 minutes, and we would have been denied some of McCaffrey's best books."
2,Readable,"_Nimsha's Ship is a VERY standard ""lost in space"" plot and if she'd bothered to put any *people* it, it would be ok reading. She's populated it, however, with tissue-thin paper puppets without even the advantages of the Balinese or Japanese prototypes which have at least some historical personality. Oh, it's not going to be any trouble to finish it. The actual order of words is professional -- and it certainly isn't burdened with anything new or different to cause indigestion. My greatest regret is that I paid book club prices for it. This is strictly a UBS item.* To top it off, the cover art is awful."
1,How Disappointing,"I love Anne McCaffrey's work and was glad to see a new direction. Until I started reading it. What I found was a family structure that seemed cobbled together from Mario Puzo's Godfather and Frank Herbert's Bene Gesserit. When I started finding elements of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and then Voyager, I had to put the book down. It's too much of bits and pieces strung together to try to resemble something original. It fails, badly.This is one manuscript that should have been relegated to the recycling bin."
3,It's an improvement . . .,". . . over recent McCaffrey novels. Nimisha's Ship is a return to the universe described in The Coelura.This is the first McCaffrey novel I have read in quite a while that didn't involve a relentlessly dull journey to a fatuously happy ending. It will keep you turning the pages, but it's not really hard SF - none of her novels are - just an adventure-type plot with some SF devices such as AI computers and space travel. She has totally passed up the opporunity to explore the social implications of the body-heir system, in my opinion.It's a good read as long as you don't expect too much intellectual stimulation. And I wouldn't recommend spending the money for the hardcover edition, to be blunt."
4,A fast pased love story,"A refreshing read as the novel combineds relationships, tech-advances, and aliens. The social structure of the First Families is not such a far-off concept that it would be unacceptable. McCaffrey stays true to the usage of heroines (at least in the novels I have read). Yet this story, though the tech is impressive as is the ""fictional sicience"", is dominated by the relationships between the characters. McCaffrey has to be one of those few writers that can create very real and memorable characters. The only missing thing from the story was the lack of development in the Sh'im. Their relations with each other and the humans would have added to the depth of the novel."
2,"Well, the title fits..","First..I am a McCaffrey fan...but this book doesn't really live up to some of her previous novels...high on special effects, and neglects plot and dialogue...I mean, we have a couple of really great nasty villains...who basically stay in the background and make threatening noises, and a wondrous ship, which is more like a deus ex machina than anything else. I know that technology is by definition unbelievably advanced in the future, but the stuff she has the Ship doing really strains credibility unless the AI is developing sentience...c'mon, Anne, you can do better."
2,a bummer,"I didn,t know the battery had a short turn of life,they only last me about 20 mins what a bummer never had problems with any pruchases before but this was a sad one for me, cloudn,t record my grandaugters firsts steps"
2,Opening Screen Annoyance,Every time I turn on the DCR-DVD92 if I'm not using a Sony dvd I get a annoying message asking me to use Sony dvd's. This message lasts for about 15 seconds and blocks the entire lcd screen and view finder. If I'm trying to make a quick shot I can forget it. This message is something that Sony should have left off. I feel it's simply an attempt to make you buy Sony dvd's. I have found viewing still pictures also to be a problem.I haven't found a way yet to view them on anything but the DCR-DVD92. Unless I use the the handycam when I select still pictures to view from the menu it rapidly goes through them not allowing me to make a selection. I do mean fast (blink of the eye).Had I known these things pryor to purchase I would have never bought this Handycam.
5,"Amazing features, Easy Playback","Having moved from MiniDV to DVD, I am so pleased with this purchase. I did not want to spend this much money, but when I watch a replay of my son's T-ball game on our home DVD player, it is worth it! No more wires to connect to the TV, or adapters to hook up. Simply take the DVD out of the camcorder and pop it in the DVD player on your TV. That's it. The zoom features are great - not too much that the images get shaky, but enough to bring far-away images up close. I would highly reccomend this product."
1,War of the end of the world,How the hell is this not on Kindle!??! He only won the Nobel Prize and this is his latest book right!?
4,I like it.,It was very well packaged the price was right . It' seemed to work well for what I am using it for.the only thing is this one is taken water.
5,Great Product when Stressed/Irritable,California Poppy has been a tremendous asset to me since I discovered it about a year ago. I usually take it when I feel stressed or highly irritable. Almost all the time my mood and irritability have been lifted greatly. It really is one of those products that has worked for me. Highly Recommended.
4,Scary...,"A muted dread, cowered in a dark corner of an overimposing cathedral is how I can best describe a reaction of someone listening to this work. Messiaen was an organist and a devout catholic. One cannot help but imagine a manner of liturgy expressed in the choppy, sentence-like phrasing here. To say this is a horror flick's sound track may be trite, especially because it would trivialise Messiaen's distinct language, a very unique one it is. He grapples with something beyond reach, that may be true of most of his music. The rhythm is instantly recognizeable as his own. Anyone who already knows his work will be able to understand his unique language, but even if you don't it may be worth your while - but only if you're willing to listen to this disc more than eight times."
5,Small Business Start-up Kit,"It is well written and easy to understand. Not a lot of legal jargon that you have to wade through, but legal nevertheless. I will continue to use it for a reference.Thank you for such a easy to read and understand book!"
4,best small biz reference,"I love the way the author gives good description for people who never have education on how to start a small business in California, is it easy to follow."
4,POWER FILM R15-300 rollable solar panel,"It Is very compact, I use it to charge boat battery. Very easy to set up on boat. Can store in boat when not charging by rolling it up.Seems a little high priced,but probably because of its compact size."
4,a good narrative,"I read this book cover-to-cover, which wasn't what I expected to do; I expected to use it more as a reference. However, it's written so well and contains so much helpful advice that I found it easy to read straight through. I'm new at gardening, but I'm already making good use of the information in my own yard."
4,It Works,It does work but feel like the description was mis-leading as it seemed to say it took short movies also but works good for stills...
2,FIREBURPS,"I'm sure you remember as a kid going to fireworks displays and just how many times the supposedly ""awesome"" ones kind of died in midair. This is what I feel about FIREWORKS, a rambling, incohesive, dull character study. While the idea of letting us get to know characters well is commendable, why write a book about an alien spaceship that crashes into a lake and not explore it any further? Little comes of the spaceship, except the usual government coverup. Most of the characters are stereotyped to the max, and those few you care about bite the dust. And then, the spaceship just goes away, no explanations, and we're given this coy cutesy ending. What a waste of trees."
2,"Not bad, but a few issues...","Have had this boombox for 5-6 months now. Features are not bad for the price, however there are a few issues with this box.- A/C Power supply is huge.- Not very loud, max volume is not quite enough.- Poor docking design, have to fiddle with it most times to get the audio jack to connect properly. Not sure this will last."
3,XAct XS034 Sirius satellite radio Boombox,"First, I was very dissapointed because the way the boombox description was worded, I thought there would be a radio receiver included. Second, it is cheap plastic. Third, when I called the seller, they did not have the radio to go with it. Fourth, The shipping and handling was so high, that if I was to return the boombox, pay return shipping, and get a refund, I would have lost money. I ended up buying another radio from EBAY."
1,Disappointed from Cape Cod,"When I received this bracelet, I was delighted with it. It is light weight and comfortable to wear 24 hours a day. ANd it is nice looking. However, I have since discovered that is is poorly made. The small wire circles that connect the bracelet together are weak. Within few days, one link fell apart and the bracelet fell off. Happily with a pair of pliers, I could squeeze the link back together, but I now realize that this is likely to keep happening, so am reluctant to wear it without watching for this. I expect I will loose it another time."
1,The truth about Alexandre Pires,"To the people that aren't from Brazil and don't know Alexandre Pires: I will tell you something that happened with Alexandre.Some time ago, Alexandre Pires was drunk and with his car he killed a motocyclist. He was totally wrong but that singer wasn't arrested, because he is famous and probably paid the bail. If you understand what I'm saying, think about him... Does he compose all his lovely songs (not samba songs, only romantic songs)?Thanks for the attention,Helen"
2,Tortuous Reading,"I was really interested in the story, but the author wrote like a 5th grader. Every sentence seemed to be written in the same boring way. THis was a really brutal read which I couldnt finish."
1,A waste of money.,"I can't believe I finished it. I found its only qualities to be that it loosely follows the movie ""Jerimiah Johnson"" and the picture of Andrew Garcia ( ""A Tough Trip Through Paradise"") on the cover. I was not impressed with the constant ""homo-erotica"" of the main character riding nude in the rain and singing classical music at the top of his lungs. I wished some member of some tribe would have filled him full of arrows and shut him up. I won't go into my opinion of the ""Crazy Woman"", other than that she would have been the ""frozen - starved - dead woman"" long before I had to endure her as "" crazy"". Throwing my copy away - should have spent my money on beer !"
5,When I need to laugh - this movie is it!,No matter how many times I watch this movie and already know what's coming - I crack up laughing. These guys are at their best as they grumble and complain from one scrape to another while they work their way cross country to a wedding of their children. I think this is the best one Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon have done together.
2,Cheesy punk rock,"The music is okay but I can't get over the stupid lyrics. I'm not one for intellectual or in-depth lyrics, but most of the songs are just stupid (i.e. ""Addicted to Oi!"" and ""Safety pinned and sick""). I've even tried to listen to their newer stuff and at first it sounds good but then you hear the lyrics."
4,Seems to work,Since I am not a scientist I can't be 100% on how good this stuff is. I use it at work in a heated ultra sonic cleaner as a pre-clean for dry heat sterilization.
5,Bakshi Brilliance,"Ever Since the ultra- notorious 'X-rated and animated' cult classic 'Fritz The Cat' hit the screens of 1972 , animation auteur Ralph Bakshi , in only four pictures (""Fritz The Cat"" , ""Heavy Traffic , ""Street Fight"" and ""American Pop"")shook up American animation like Fellini shook up live action. The most conterversiol of the foursome was ""Coonskin"" now retitled ""Street Fight"" , this film is not only Bakshi's masterpiece but arguably the greatest piece of animation ever created , written and directed by Bakshi the film is a brilliant acid satire of pop culture , this film manages to be super offenive about EVERYTHING , from Disney musicals to buxom blondes , ""Street Fight"" is a masterpiece , this film needs to be on DVD."
3,B Movie destined to be classic.,"In my teens this movie was on cable movie channels after dark ""constantly"" While the plot and storyline is very developed the acting is mediocre at best as well as unconvincing.However this film does seem to grab at the viewers human side and give it a jolt from the evil machine side as the concept of killer machines in the ground called ""screamers"" is something to scream about even though the film doesn't do it for you.I rated this film three stars because I believe with the low budget and extremely small pool of actors to choose from the film did pull off a sense of satisfaction. I had fond memories of this film and believe it will stick around in the underground scifi circuit.-Mike"
1,So very very bad,"This is perhaps the worst movie of all time. Granted, I haven't seen every movie ever made, but it's just hard to imagine anything topping this monstrosity. See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you."
3,"Okay, but it could have been better.","The thing that got me about this movie is that it made me think a little about how far we can go. It kind of reminded me of this other sci-fi movie that had an ""alien"" come and get caught by scientists to research. It turns out that this ""alien"" was a human from the future of Earth come to warn the people to stop destroying it. At the end of Screamers I thought ""Wait. If that teddy bear is a screamer, too, and that guy is going back to Earth, won't all the people on Earth get killed?"" That was the best part. The ending--it would have been a better movie if it started on Earth after the ship got back and then eventually the story was told, but since it wasn't that way I have to say that the movie was pretty good for what it was."
1,stapler shot me !,"These powershot staplers used to be good. They are now a crap producing company. I bought three at home depot and they all were missing outside screws and nuts and of course they did not work. I called the company and they told me the ""top of the line orange one works"". I ordered one from Amazon and it is junk, it has a delayed fire problem. I shot myself in the stomach, as it went off 2 minutes later. After 10 delayed shots everything broke off! THESE ARE DANGEROUS."
2,Short of the mark,"I upgraded to this stapler after my 5700 version died. The 5700 was poorly constructed internally with key pieces being seriously underbuilt.As the 8000 was pretty much the only 'high end' stapler at my local hardware I thought I'd give it a go.Its fired a little over a full box of staples by my estimates. Sadly its now doing all sort of things wrong : not ejecting a staple, ejecting multiple staples, causing the load mechanism to fly open end empty all the staples. And they're genuine staples too.While it worked solidly at the start its sad to say it wasn't built to last very long at all.My cheapo air stapler run rings around it. And my 20 year old Rexel stapler still fires every time!"
4,Neil and Tim Shine,"I was very anxious to hear this album when it first came out. But when I finally did hear it, it was not what I had expected. Repeated listenings were needed. I assumed it would be the highly polished and sometimes over produced sound of Crowded House. Instead what I heard was a basic no frills approach. The album has a sort of homemade feel to it. Neil and Tim play virtually every instrument on this. Everything is low key. But what isn't low key is the talent that these two brothers possess. The song writing is very melodic and at times the harmonies are quite extraordinary. But that should come as no surprise coming from these two. We need more output from these guys. Albums are few and far between."
4,Easy to read,"Mr. Roberts has written a number of Holmes pastiches and this is his latest. His style of writing is easy to read and quite enjoyable. There has been a play written along the same lines as the premise of this book, namely the murder of Cardinal Tosca. Some Catholics may be offended by Cardinal Tosca's perversions but it should not came as a surprise with all the media coverage involving some of the Church's priests and their years of abuse.This is not his best book but I happen to like Roberts pastiches. This is a story about fanatics, criminal lords and religious officials. The Baker Street Irregulars are wonderful here and champions. Read it for yourself and make a judgement."
3,A good album from an Indie band,"This was one of many of those bands where a group of young people who had heads full of ideas go into a studio and cut an album and it sold a few copies (a few thousand copies perhaps, but a few in relative terms)This is a good album. The band doesn't use scales, so their melodies are very unusual. The production could be better, but that's not a big deal. They are essentially a rock band. The lineup is guitars, bass and drums. The vocals are raw but decent. They tell weird stories. It isn't a very pop-sounding album, it's very raw and hard-edged. It's garage band-jamming, there's some good instrumental sections. Their lyrics are very weird, sometimes humourous stories. It has a fairly dark feeling aura to it, but it is essnetially raw-garage jams. I liked it, hope you will too, Brendan"
2,Juvenilia largely of interest to conoisseurs,"It says on the back ""The source material for these early Glenn Gould Performances(ferric oxide tape, LPs, and 78 r.p.m. acetates) reflect the sound limitations of their day. Through digital remastering, every effort has been made to obtain the maximum fidelity possible"". If you think you'd like to see F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda's home movies, you might like this. Don't think this is GG-the-master we have known since the 1955 Goldberg Variations -- this is a young person just with that inherent potential. That's its magic."
2,Better not published,"I bought this CD because I believed it will reveal something new about Glenn Gould.I was also very interested to hear Gauarero (Gould's teacher).Guarero can be heard playing side by side with Gould.well, the result was disappointing for many reasons to the extend that I rather not buy it."
4,Works under OSX 10.5,"Although the product description online, and the pamphlet that comes with it specify Windows operating systems, this product does indeed work properly on my old (November 2007) 15"" MacBook Pro, running Leopard OSX 10.5. So far, it has successfully provided sufficient power for a wireless mouse receiver dongle and a USB software key dongle (For Propellerhead's Reason) without issue. I may get bold, and try to run my Western Digital USB Hard drive on it later, but for now, I wanted to advise that it works out of the package under OSX with these items.Will update later.Update: Western Digital USB Hard drives do indeed work fine on it, as does my Akai USB MIDI controller keyboard. Very happy with this item except for one minor nag: It easily is pulled out of the ExpressCard slot in my MacBook Pro - there's no real latching function. Other than that, it works great, and seems to carry enough power for anything I need to do with it."
4,Exploring the backlash against The Satanic Verses,"If you've read Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses and want to know more about the controversy over the book and the death sentence placed on him by the Ayatollah Khomeini, this book provides a variety of articles from critics, political leaders, authors, and reporters on the events that occurred after publication of Rushdie's novel and the issues that caused them. I found it to be very helpful in understanding what parts of the book exactly were found to be particularly offensive by Muslims, since my own knowledge of Islamic traditions and culture is lacking. Since it is a compilation of many sources, it provides a wide array of opinions and perspectives that help to shed light on differing views of censorship, freedom, tolerance, and sacredness."
3,"Good Read, but not as good as Ghost Story","I am a fan of all things horror - especially a good ghost story.Based on the reviews I have seen others post, I bought this book hoping to be scared out of my wits. I wasn't.Don't get me wrong, it's a decent book. Some parts really are scary and the characters Hynd creates are ones you become involved with quickly.If you are truly looking for something frightening, try GHOST STORY by Peter Straub.I read it when I was 15 and was scared for weeks. Nothing has touched it since..."
2,"Great story, awful prose","Noel Hynd tells a great ghost story, there's no doubt. I was nicely creeped out, and anxious to find out what happened next. That said, Hynd could use a much better editor. His dialogue was awkward at best, incomprehensible at worst. The book was full of cringeworthy grammatical errors--so many I assumed it was a first novel. Imagine my surprise when I found he had published more than a dozen!I finished this book for the strength of the story, but I won't be picking up any more Noel Hynd."
5,Don't Misunderstand Emotion Marketing,"This book is easy to read, and even easier to misunderstand. It's not about TV ads that use emotions to peddle products. It's about making customers feel as if they have a personal friendship with the brands they choose. It offers crucial insights into the cause and affect relationship between customer loyalty and the emotions that customers have for brands. It's a must read for marketing executives looking for next big idea. Unfortunately, it's missing a chapter on measurement. Students should read it in conjunction with Fredrick Reichheld's books on customer loyalty."
5,Who doesn't want to look younger?,"I love these doctors. All very interesting and exciting to learn about our bodies and how what we do to them, feed them, put on them affects us."
3,Good but not great,"This film is good but there are a lot of screw-ups. Bruce Willis, Denzel Washington, and Annette Benning were great picks for this film but it lacked in substance. It was exciting yet many parts were boring. But don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie, in fact I own it!"
4,9/11/01 Life imitating art,"Umar Adeeb says that the story was implausible. Let us take a look at this day in American history. Implausible. I think not. Wonderful story. Watching the news right now and then watching the movies, it all seems so closely related. But then again so do WAG the Dog and Canadian Bacon."
3,life imitates art,"I haven't seen this movie, but given the recent attack on the world trade center, it may be something everyone should watch"
3,Art Imitating Life and Vice Versa,"I never thought anything as awful as what is depicted in this film could really happen until September 11, 2001, when cruel reality struck. Those events will no doubt make future viewings all the more chilling."
2,bad,"Have you ever watched a movie and found a character so annoying and hated them so bad that you wish you could reach through the screen, pull them out and wring their neck. That's Annette Benning in this movie. If that's the effect she wanted to achieve then more power to her but it seems that they try to make her a simpathetic figure in this movie. Sorry kids...doesn't work for me. When it comes to over the top bleeding heart liberalism she takes the cake. So does this movie. It's just nonsense. Hello all you cynics out there. Later"
4,Denzel deserved an Oscar for this one,"This film is a frightening but superb look at the ineptness of American Federal agencies and America's involvements in foreign affairs. Denzel's character is admittedly idealistic about his enforcement of the constitution of the United States and even basic human decency. He finds himself caught up in the unthinkable. Denzel turns in an Oscar winning performance along with excellent back up from Tony Shaloub and Bruce Willis who put their best acting abilities into this movie.The excellent acting and frightening scenario of choices, definitely make this a thinking persons film. This movie is not anti-anyone, but rather shows what wrong thinking on any side of a conflict can do especially with this emotional issue.This is a must see for it's political content, and also proves that Denzel deserved an Oscar long before he really won one."
2,A mediocre movie.,"The DVD has no extras, just the movie and trailer. Two good explosions in this unlikely scenerio. Bad plot, bad morality play, lousy action. Skip this dog."
2,"Predictable, stereotypical, in a word: Terrible","The direction is crappy (very predictable). The acting was bad (except for Denzel Washington, who was brilliant as always). Annette Bening acted like she was a 19-year-old actress auditioning for the first time. Absolutely not convincing. Bruce Willis looked as if he doesn't know where he is or what's going on. It's a pity that the director of the gem Courage Under Fire would make a movie like this. Plus, he stereotyped Muslims and Arabs in those negative things. He didn't appear to do even simple research about Islam, because if he had, he would've known that adultery is a major sin in Islam."
2,Barney let's go to the zoo,What a disappointment. My children (17 months old) love Barney and the gang but no children were included in this video. They lost interest in it very quickly which is unusual for a Barney video. It was very boring.
4,A barney review....,"Pretty good dvd, although there is a limited amount of animals in it. It would have been neat if they could have shown more animals than just the few....other than that my daughter seems to love the comments in the beginning from the other children. According to her this will remain in our collection, she just turned 2."
2,Nice Product but Defective,"It's an adorable product but unfortunately it was a defected one. The foot or claw was put on backwards. Also, for some reason, you cannot shut off the i-Cat without removing the batteries - several people read and followed the directions but it just wouldn't shut off. Every 5 minutes it gives off a piercing meow sound which can get on your nerves after a while. In any event, I chose not to return it since it was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she didn't really want to part with it."
3,Cute Toy,I bought these for the kids at Christmas and they loved them. They were on sale and for the price I couldn't beat the deal. They were playing with them even without them being hooked up to their Ipods. It's a really cute toy and was a great stocking stuffer.
1,Surprised,"I'm a senior citizen and I purchased this CD for the song MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO GEORGIA not really expecting to be into the rest of the songs. After receiving the CD it has become one of my favorites. The disco beat and energy reminds me of my disco days and I catch myself ""attempting"" to repeat some of the old dance steps. I recomend this CD if you like GOOD TIME MUSIC.Bob"
5,MULTIPHASIC,This has got to be one of the most useful kitchen tools of all time. Who could live without it? Joyce Chen knows how to make em right while offering them for a decent price as well. This gadget ROCKS!
4,strainer,"good product overall, fair value, I found something comparable for less money in a local store..."
3,"Works well, but protruding wires shred sponges and towels","As others have said, strainers with wide mesh like this drain boiled and fried items better than typical screen-type strainers. Surface tension of water and oils get carried along easier with finer mesh. This strainer allows you to tap off excess water/oil easily and will drip less than slotted spoons or fine mesh.My problem is that the ends of the wires wrapped around the outer ring stick out and were not wrapped flush. I discovered this by trying to hand wash the strainer - it shredded the sponge I used. Forget about wiping dry with a towel as it'll be snagged by the wires. The only practical way to hand wash is to swish in soapy water and air dry.I spent a few minutes with a needle nose pliers in an attempt to bend the ends around so they don't snag so readily, but it still is a problem. I guess this strainer will be 'dishwasher only' for me.O.K. for the price, but be aware of the wires..."
5,Great Buy,"If you don't have one or your friend doesn't have one then you need to buy a spider, if you think you wont use it, try it, you love it."
3,"""Do you mean to say that is one of god's creatures? Professor""","""No Andy that is one of mans follies. ""One great advantage to this Uh.... Movie is we get to see the hokey creatures up front. The story unfolds fast and the plot is set up front. Then we get to see it unfold. Sort of like an old Colombo (Peter Falk) show where everyone knows the culprit in advance. We also get some really bad background music with a 50's feel.Professor King (Michael Whalen) dabbles with the forces of nature and gets the standard results. His daughter Lois (Cathy Downs) of course knows nothing about it; if she had only known in time. Lois and Dr. King are perused by a technical investigator, Dr. Ted Stevens (Kent Taylor.)Someone is dispatching people with a scuba spear. Who and why. Just what is the secret?I wanted to give this movie one star but on reflection I really watched it.Remember:""Nature has many secrets that man must not disturb, this is one of them"""
2,Disappointing,"I have had these speakers for several years in the wall of my bedroom and I hate them. Very poor bass, and generally muddy sound. Similar to other reviewer, even driving with high power you get weak sound. I have Canton in-wall speakers througout the rest of my house, and they are a thousand times better, but I had bought these CS speakers before I knew better. I will probably replace them with Canton if I can find a pair that will fiut in the same cutout, or will maybe cheap out and try the Polk's, which from the reviews people seem to like, and they are very reasonably priced."
3,Failed to inspire,"This has the reputation of being a cult classic. Maybe, but it didn't inspire me to dash into the kitchen. There are excellent vegetarian books available at a far lower price"
3,3rd Best Album,"His best is still ""Urban Suite"" but this one wasn't bad. It was better than ""Embrya"" (which I didn't totally hate either). My favorite tracks are ""Got To Get To Know You"", ""W/As My Girl"",""N/One"" & ""Woman's Worth."""
3,Maxwell just gets the job done...but not much more!,"This album is good. Highlights for me are""Get To Know Ya"",""This Woman's Work"", ""Noone""""For Lover's Only"" and ""Now/At The Party"".Have A Nice Day!"
5,A truly poetic soul!,"True Maxwell fans have been anxiously awaiting the release of this album and there is no disappointment here. I have been a fan of Maxwell for years and have all of his albums. This is his best album to date. It plays like an intimate conversation that we have been allowed to partake in. Emotionally, this album is open and raw. I was in awe. There is nothing like this out at this time. From the arrangements, to the instrumental selections, to the lyrics.......Maxwell did not go wrong. His love for the music comes through in every note and word. Maxwell is and always will be a truly poetic soul."
3,Predictable and uneven,"The movie is utterly predictable. You KNOW that Hoffman's character will take the lead in the students' rebellion against the trustees; you KNOW Cook's character will shed her weenie past to join the rebellion as soon as she feels safe; you KNOW Keena's character will fall for the Flat Critter member who keeps pursuing her...etc etc etc. I do have to give the film credit where credit is due; even though they cast the winning Kirsten Dunst, the elfin Rachael Leigh Cook, and the buxom Gaby Hoffman in lead roles, they also cast the doggy Heather Matarazzo and the tomboyish Merritt Weaver.The movie consists mostly of Keena looking cute, Dunst acting rebellious and making smart-assed comments, Hoffman looking bemused (or flatulent), and Cook looking horrified. It's entertaining enough, but the plot is VERY uneven and the talent of these actress cannot save the tissue-thin script."
2,Surprised to see a bad review?,"I'm a big Simon & Garfunkel fan, but this is definitely my least favorite of their records. Somehow it just misses. Bright spots are ""America"" and ""Mrs. Robinson"" but besides that... The guys don't seem to be working together much. Paul wants to do his own thing, and some of these songs sound like they should be on a Paul Simon album. And Art Garfunkel is obsessed with growing old...which is charming for a while but gets, pardon me, gets old. They have better albums. Any of them."
4,"If Simon and Garfunkel are bookends, I'll leave Garfunkel off the shelf","Side One is great: ""Save the Life of My Child"" is sonically interesting if a bore lyrically, ""America"" is magnificent and reads like a passage from ""On the Road,"" and ""Overs"" isn't bad. (There's also ""Voices of Old People,"" Garfunkel's most apparent contribution to the album, which, unsurprisingly, is foolish.) Side Two is ridiculous; even ""Mrs. Robinson"" is dragged down by her four worthless peers. The cover says it all: Simon looks kind of interesting; Garfunkel looks as thick as his hair."
3,3 and 1/2 stars...,"The good songs on this album are excellent and some of the best pop songwriting of the past century. But the weak stuff (Save The Life Of My Child, Voices of Old People, Punky's Delima, and At The Zoo) is mediocre. That said I really like America, Hazy Shade of Winter, and of course Mrs.Robinson. But, for an album that is barely 30 minutes long, there is way too much filler. For a better portrait of why Simon and Garfunkel are so great, check out Bridge Over Troubled Water."
4,Not THAT bad.,"Though this album does have a few clunkers like ""Save the life of my child"",""Fakin' it"" and ""Voices of old people"", I fail to see how people consider ""Parsley Sage Rosemary and thyme"" a better album.(""big bright green pleasure machine""? ""A Simple Desultory philippic""?-gag-)""Punky's Dillemma"" and ""At the Zoo"" are ten times better than that! This album may not be their best, but it does deserve more credit than the last few posts were willing to give it. This album was released in 1968 when everyone was experimenting with music! What did you expect, a ""folk"" album?"
3,"The most ambitious, but not the best","I love songs like America or Mrs.Robinson, but on the whole there is too much experimentations on this album to endure. 'Voices of Old People' is the worst thing they've ever done, but the rest is ok."
4,Crack in the World,Been looking for this movie for a long time the only place i found it was on Amazon .........It was packaged well and came within 3 weeks I will deal with Amazon in the future
3,BAD CHARGER,"The screwdriver is great and I like It a lot but I have had a lot of trouble with the charger, I have gone through 2 chargers in the past year and half, I just wish the charger was built better than it is."
2,Decent Book but not Spectacular,I used this book as a reference for my reactor engineering class. Though it was easily read I was disappointed that the book lacked a lot of computer problems and especially lacked coverage in energy balances
2,Too detailed,"As a final year undergraduate, I find that this book is fairly useless. Although the information is in there, it is nigh on impossible to find. It would probably be of use to someone who is working on research in that field, but to a student who has not yet done such detailed work, don't bother. Save your money and spend it on beer."
4,Interestingly unusual,"This best of collection surprised me after having grown up with Livgren's ""other"" group Kansas. Initially I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this CD the first time around. However, the rather unsual variety of works here are indeed interesting and I have found many of the tunes sticking with me, a Livgren trademark reminiscent of my college days listening to Kansas."
4,Tour of the Many Faces of the Southland,"This book is a historical, economic and cultural overview of the various Southern states. It is full of information. Some of it essential, like its account of how African slaves were first brought to America in 1619. But many of its stories are more obscure and less likely to hold reader interest. Personally, I skipped right through its account of the National Tobacco Spitting Contest. But this book covers alot of ground and everyone will find something of interest."
1,Help the Jewish Antisemites Eat,"It is a known fact that Chomsky and Finkelstein are kept isolated by the academia, together with a number of other antisemitic Jews. The reason why this 'show' does not sell can easily be understood once you pay the cost - but then it is too late. I fell for this trick and soon I will ask Amazon to buy it back at any price."
3,Bridge over troubled water CD,"Good CD but in poor condition, ejects itself, says ""err"", stops in mid song, plays same song 2XD, etc. I bought ""new"" but it's not."
1,Bridge Over Troubled Water,This is not a slam on the seller but on Amazon. I ordered 5 titles that were advertised to be in a mini-disc format. All of the other sellers cancelled except this one when they saw it was really a cassette. They said Amazon improperly identified them as mini-discs. Cassettes are a useless format these days and I probably will never listen to this but it's too much trouble to return it.Kjacks
3,The voices were not strong,The voices could hardly be heard over the instruments. I thought perhaps it was my set up. I have another CD S&G album and played it. My CD sounded fine. This is not the first time I've experienced this with some of the MP3 albums. I should have listened to more album samples as in checking back they have the same problem.
5,Who doesn't like Simon & Garfunkel?!?!,"I wanted to get the CD version of what I already owned on vinyl and this was perfect. The price was great, too."
5,Thought-provoking,"I was right about my intuitions about this film. I thought it would be good, and it was great. It is one of those films that is very convincing in its ability to make you feel everything the characters are going through as they make burden-laden ethical decisions in their lives.Vince Vaughn's character Sheriff is easy to hate at first as the cocky, selfish guy, but his transformation is both very believable and very moving. If you need to see a movie about courage and doing the right thing in spite of the terrible consequences, this is the one.Unlike a majority of the other reviewers, I thought the love story between Heche and Vaughn was an asset to the film. What they have with each other at the end leaves you feeling that although the ending turns out tragic, you still feel good about how things stand."
3,nice but not upto expectations,Bought this watch for my husband. nice dial but was very disappointed with the quality of the belt. looked like some cheap strap rather than the top quality you expect from Movado. all in all would have kept it if the belt would have been better quality
5,"Disease, Sanitation, and Cities","Leavitt's Healthiest City provides one of the only comprehensive reviews of the history of public health in Milwaukee. While the topic may seem obscure, public health in U.S. cities has played a prominent role in both the formation of political policies and the quality of life in our urban areas. Leavitt's book takes a look at the importance of public health in a city once slated as ""America's Healthiest""."
4,Definitely a see-again!,"This made my boyfriend and I cry, argue, nod in agreement, and dialogue. I recommend it for still singles and for singles who aren't yet hitched. Another strong performance from Hunter since ""The Piano"". A cute and touching performance from DeVito. A very small part by Latifah but if she was the one singing, a very big voice! I'm sorry that the film was overlooked by the viewing public but then again, these are the same people that bought more tickets to see ""Chucky's Bride"" than ""Beloved""."
3,Slow But Interesting To Watch,"This dramedy doesn't really have a plot that goes from A to B. It is the character study of a woman blindsided by a divorce and two people she becomes friendly with. Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah's characters serve to help Holly Hunter's character get through her crisis. The movie is a bit slow, but it has its good scenes. The ending doesn't solve everyone's problems in a definitive manner, but it is hopeful. I recommend it based on the acting, as well as Queen Latifah's singing talent (she does a good job)."
4,Fresh and Smooth but too ordinary,"This cologne was great for my little brother when he was in middle school and was new to cologne. If you don't typically wear cologne, this might be for you. However as taste in cologne develops, this begins to smell as plain as soap. Again this is certainly ""good smelling"" but it doesn't have the uniqueness that makes a cologne special and worth the money. So if you want something to smell like this and even last longer, go to CVS and get Bod or Axe. After a while of using this though, you will want a more unique and tasteful fragrance."
2,Not great,"I think anyone into cologne or perfume has smelled this (assuming they haven't owned it) on at least a dozen others.Curve is the kind of scent you would expect to find littered around a college campus. Its a heavy synthetic smell, with a brutal starting point bubbling with artificial lavender and berry, and finishing to a warm but overbearing citrus and sandalwood base.Curve smells good if its applied extremely lightly, but this is never the case.The target audience would be young men ages 14-21. I bought my first bottle (the four ounce) when I was a freshman in high school, and I haven't been able to finish even half of the bottle through the years.Prospective buyers should definitely give it a test run."
5,Great item at an amazing price,"I found this cologne a while back and recently ran out, i decided to shop around for a good price and even thought about changing colognes. But then i searched amazon and found that they had a very large bottle about 10 times the size of the old one i had and for only 10 dollars more, so i bought it , it came in the mail sooner than i expected and in perfect shape in a nice gold/bronze colored tin and it smells amazing of course and i have already received numerous compliments."
4,My review,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was very differnt than the show, though the only thing similar was the face off of the boys. My fave character is Peyton and I enjoy watching CMM play basketball.I was glad that I bought this book and enjoyed it very much. I cannot wait until 'Season 1: OTH' comes out on dvd. I hope my review was helplful to you."
1,This is AWFUL,"I usually enjoy reading books that are adapted from a television show becuase I could get inside their head but this was awful. I read maybe that first two pages and put it down. I felt like I was reading a fifth grader's story. This was the worst $6 I've ever spent. If you want to understand One Tree Hill you'd best by the DVD because you are just going to get a headache from this pre-teen, dare I say, novel."
4,Hollywood Knights,A risque version to American Graffiti. Not comparing just using A/G as a reference. Went to see it when it came out at the theaters years ago. Typical movie of the period. Has some funny moments and has actors that later become big or semi big. And some good cars for the motor heads. 30 years later and I still get a few laughs. Worth getting.
3,I still like this movie.,It's one of may 80s teen movies based in the 50s and 60s. This one isn't the best but it has several unbelievably funny moments.
5,hollywood knights,"Hollywood Knights.....simply the BEST cult comedy film.When you need to laugh this movie is the one. A hot rod Caddyshack. No need to rent it, buy it, you'll wear it out. CAUTION...""it has a little wang in it."""
4,lords of flatbush & porkys go to L.A.,"The Hollywood Knights is one of those easy, mindless funny movies along the lines of The Lords of Flatbush,Porkys & American Grafetti that is of a special time period of growing up with your friends,hot cars & the music of that era. You get to see some very young & new actors on their way up like Tony Danza,Michelle Phillips,Robert Wuhl,Fran Dresher & Stuwart Pankin who by the way was execellent as the NURD. Its a real feel good movie that should be in your collection."
4,Finally released!,"This movie became a cult classic amongst my group of buddies back in high school (late 1980's). My best friend's older brother had a tape version off UHF and we would watch it every couple of months, in fact we still use some of the fantastic one liners from this film.Since the release 5 copies have found their way to 5 very happy guys. A few of us had been searching for this for years.Anyway, you can see some of todays stars early in their careers in a great comedy. A little tamer version of Porky's but with stars and hot cars.Music is great and the jokes are moronic- which is perfect.Great film."
2,Hollywood Knights--I've waited 15 years!,"Absolutely one of the corniest but funniest movies I have ever seen. First saw it around 1984 or 85 on HBO late at night. Robert Wuhl is a crazy man in this movie as Newbomb Turk. Great cast of soon to be and current stars. Not the greatest movie ever made, but it's just great time! I'd recommend it for a party, or just for kicks. I'm so glad it's finally been released!"
2,"""cheezy""","maybe back in the day this movie might have been pretty good but times have changed! in fact i didn't even laugh while watching it,"
5,Still as funny today,"I think I am one of the few who actually paid to see this movie in the theater when it opend in '80. At the time I was a senior in HS. It still makes me laugh regardless of how many times I watch the DVD or VHS (yes I own both) over and over again. I loved the movie so much that I named my first Old English Sheepdog NewBomb. I had the name picked out and the breed of dog literally since I saw the movie even thouhg there isnt and OES in the flick. The next dog I got we named Dudley after Dudley Laywicker int he movie.. I was going to name the next dog Iron Box but though better of it! I have shown the movie to so many of my friends and family now that we quote lines from it to each other all the time... My puffer NewBomb, my pufffer! Movie snobs wont like it, but us regualr folks who remember fixing up cars and cruising and hangout at places, not lik ein the 50's but the late 70's and early 80's.."
1,Just Awful,"Robert Wuhl, Corny Music, Fragmented Scenes, 70s Haircuts, No StoryLine, make this freebie Just Awful. Ready to turn it off in the first 8 minutes, I struggled through to around 20; then, I could not take this any longer. By the way, isn't Robert Wuhl like 45 years old in this--playing a High Schooler? Wannabe American Graffiti, which also sucks. Has Michelle Pfeiffer ever NOT played annoyed/angry in any of her roles? All she does is argue in every movie she's ever made. That's a prime indicator that she has No Acting Ability Whatsoever. And Fran DressCher lends her annoying Honk to this Moronic Film! Just a complete Waste of Time. Utter Trash that should Not have been made. Thank God I didn't pay for it. And lastly, what's with all these B-Movies (no, D-Movies) on the internet? Has all the quality content gone to the Film Vaults?"
3,Average movie with some big laughs,"While somewhat of a cult classic, Hollywood Knights is not a great movie. It's basically a more juvenile version of American Graffiti. It tries to shoot for some serious moments with the Tony Danza/Michelle Pfeiffer subplot, but it's Robert Wuhl and his gang, along with some great moments from the bumbling cops, that really make it worth watching. There are some great laughs, and a few classic moments (the Lawrence of Arabia song for one) that are among the great quotable film comedy moments. The DVD is fine quality; nothing spectacular, but looks better than I ever remember this movie looking on cable."
1,Junk,The brush broke after 2 months of use. It was great for 7 weeks then fell apart. Pick something else.
2,Don't drop it...,"Ever drop your brush in the bathroom? Well if you have don't buy this one. It may be an eye catching red and have tourmaline technology, but prepare for it to break where the silver band is inserted into the handle. Before it broke in 2 I did not notice shinier, smoother hair."
3,"Hey, What's That Wet-Dog Smell?...","Two 35yo college students (played by intergalactic superstars John David Carson and Dennis Fimple) travel into the wilds of Louisiana in search of the legendary Biggus Footus creature. Along the way, they encounter Dub Taylor and Jack Elam as backwoods gents w/ stories of their own sasquatch adventures. While not frightening in the least, CFBL does have a few fun moments of near excitement, and a nice hillbilly atmosphere. Watch as a double feature w/ ABOMINABLE (where the creature actually looks a bit like Jack Elam) for added yetti yuks..."
5,Excellent Historical Series Covering The Last Days Of Royal Europe,"This review is going to be shorter than my typical reviews since there are already a number of reviews here with excellent plot summaries (this may not get me a bunch of helpful review votes, but I see no need to regurgitate anyone else's hard work -- please read the other reviews)The one caveat I would give to anyone considering watching The Fall Of Eagles is to have an understanding of the historial events. There are a lot of very important historical characters in minor roles. Even te casual viewer will get the Royal families of Europe, but this series does an excellent job with other political actors who may only appear for a scene or two. Knowledge of European history between 1848 and 1920 will also help the viewer ""fill in the gaps"" so to speak.Its an excellent video portrayal of the historical events, but don't expect to ""know all the players without a program."""
5,Why WWI was fought.,"I finally put together the reason for WWI. I always thought it was a war that was totally without reason but never figured out why it happened. Now, thanks to this show, I found it why. It still is a war that was totally without reason, much like the war in Iraq.All about greed, power, alliances, breaking apart countries and taking a part of each, etc. Leave it to the BBC to produce a historical series that takes itself seriously and sticks to the facts, so much so, that my brain was about to explode from trying to keep track of the machinations, the doublecrossing, doubledealing, lies, etc. that ended up in the loss of millions of innocent lives being lost over nothing except power of nations. (What else is new?)I've read books on WWI but this just put it all together. The acting was brilliant as well as the script. Some of the scripts were written by Jack Pulman who also wrote I, Claudius.Absolutely riveting. Keep some aspirin handy, though."
4,As advertised!,"I'm sure this will be a great help in the shop once I find adapters that fit my tools and the vacuum kit!?! My shop vac is a 'Shop-Vac' so I jumped at this without too much concern with the dust ports on my Ryobi, Craftsman, and Delta tools. The tubes that come with this kit are plenty long and with the connectors, you can have all your tools on one wall of a standard garage,(20ft)! Everything fits well and the instructions are simple and clear."
4,Educationally fun!,Bought these for my 3yr old son and he loves Let's Go to School. They are enjoyable to watch with him unlike some of the other kids videos/shows out. So thanks Leapfrog!
3,I am wondering if I got the correct DVD???,How do I get to run Talking Words Factory? I only see Lets Go To School.. I am wondering if I got the correct DVD??? any help? thank you!
4,There STILL Ain't No 'Bout-A-Doubt It,"So glad to get my hands back on this album (cd) again. Larry Graham at his best!!!! FORGET ABOUT HIS SOLO CAREER (that balladeer garbage). His best musical moments were BEFORE that, when the only thing I knew about Larry Graham was GRAHAM CENTRAL STATION!!!! This album is a must have. The first 3 cuts on the cd ALONE is enough to make the album a classic."
3,Overrated,"Sure this has GCS's statement of intent ""The Jam"" and fun part numbers such as ""Ain't Nothin But A Warner Brothers Party""but the overrall quality of the compositions is a significant step down from ""Release Yourself"" and their monster debut.Besthear it's highlites on a Greatest Hits package."
2,Not great.,"This tripod is exactly what I was looking for, except that it is of poor quality... or at least the one I received was. The mesh screen I received was rusty. In addition, the legs of the tripod which are screwed into a metal form don't quite fit, leaving you with a wobbly tripod. Wobbly is not great when using a torch to fire metals. Once I thoroughly cleaned the rusty mesh, I was able to use it, but am still a little weary of the wobbly legs."
2,Elephant garlic,"A part of the cloves were rotted,I wanted them for planting.We had to use what was not rotted for cooking."
1,I should have paid attention,"When I ordered this product, I thought I was getting the pants too. Nope, big mistake...so read all your purchases clearly. When I did get this jacket it was all faded looked (not in a cute way). It looked like it had been washed 100 times. This was a waste of my money....I was too lazy to send it back because I hate Internet returns...so this is money wasted"
2,Don't drop it.,"It's cute, but after one drop on a hard floor, the cat stopped breathing. The motor still turns on and makes noise, but something must have gotten dislodged. Bummer, cause it broke on Christmas, first day out of the box. Disappointed."
2,80's Pop Hits?,"Yes the music is from the 80's and most of it is not bad...actually some pretty good songs from that time. However, the title is ""80's POP HITS""...not ""LOVE SONGS OF THE 80'S"". Most of the songs are love songs and soft rock. Very disappointed since I already had every song on this CD in a love songs of the 80's complete set. I wasted my money because the title was so deceiving. I notice now that they include a list of the songs and you can sample them. The day I purchased it that was not the case. If you don't have any of the love songs from the 80's or soft rock then the price is fair and I would suggest it. But if you are looking for POP HITS of the 80's then don't buy."
1,What a Slow Bore!,"Of this three disk set, I would say that maybe five songs were worth listening to and even remembered. The rest were slow and so boring. I don't even remember them form the eighties.If you are looking for an eighties cd. DON""T buy this one. THERE HAS TO BE better ones out there than this one."
1,A waste of Great songs and there other songs left off,just Like the dumb film this Set makes no sense other than Capitolizing on the market with Familiar songs that can be found on way too many Compilations.this set doesn't Properly cover any one time period all the way thru.who hasn't heard&seen these songs a Million times already?
4,Excellent for the car,"Sure, this CD doesn't have the best of everything done in the span of time that Forest Gump covered, but who has the room in their car for a full collection of every artist listed on on the credits. This CD is a perfect collection of good songs. You can hear all of your favorites when and where you want to, without the hassle of continually scanning the radio dial. Plus, for those of us who cannot buy everything, this is a good base to build on in the future. Go for it. I did."
3,"Fine, if you like to play it safe...","The movie ""Forrest Gump"" was a fun romp through time. The soundtrack comes across as a middle of the road, play it safe baby boomer package once you take away the movie. A majority of these songs have already appeared on either the artist's albums or other compilations - why bother getting this one unless you like the movie packaging? Better off to start off with compilations like ""Nuggets"" or even Rhino's ""Have a Nice Day"" series if you like music from this era. Of course there are so many other compilations I can't mention due to space limitations. Simply put, skip this CD and start elsewhere."
4,Great except the smell,"These were good quality at a great price but they smell really bad, kind of like skunk and it has been really strong for about a month so far, it is going away but when my car sits out in the heat it gets really bad again, when that goes away I will love them."
2,Noise maker No Deal Here,"Purchased this item to work in Home to keep dust down, it is Noisy and ONLY has one speed! I kept this item close to 2 by material I was cutting and could not see much or hardly any thing being drawn into the unit while working.......an Hour latter I went back into (small room 8 by 10 BATH )dust had settled every where but inside of unit..........Very disapointed. Figure I lost [my investment.] I have no Idea what I can really use it for..Maybe use it in work sop in addtion to my other Air Cleaner...... I have a JDS unit in My work shop It keeps air clean CONSTANTLY! Maybe I was expectng to much...Best bet put a fan in a window and suck the dust and dirt out MUCH cheaper and works better than this thing!"
3,Que divorcio!!,"La película es buena para pasar un rato, sin embargo le falta emoción, un mensaje mejor dictado y mas recursos para ser sentida. Es una lástima porque en el caso de Kate Hudson, sabe como sensibilizar personas en las comedias dramáticas."
4,Good things about this movie,"Paris (and the scenes filmed outside the city) looked incredible. The movie is beautifully filmed as are all Merchant Ivory movies. The food, the architecture, it just pulls you in.The movie is based on a book that was written years ago and if you think of it like a modern day Jane Austen-style comedy of manners the slow-pacing makes more sense. In my opinion the book was incredibly slow as well. But in the end, I think both the book and movie are worth the time!"
1,"""Le Disaster""","I picked up this movie at a store, read the jacket and noted the stars and production team. Then I watched it looking for ""romance"", ""comedy"", and a reason to care about the story and found none. I found the movie depressing--an irate husband shooting his adulterous wife and lover, an old philanderer luring and then leaving a young lady, and stuffy French family values. The sub-story about the painting just seemed added to waste time. I mean, who cares? I waited in vain for something to happen to tie everything together. And why would Isabel throw the gun off the Eiffel Tower? It was just wrong on so many levels. They had a cast with such potential, yet had the shallowest characters I have ever seen in a movie. The best writing was on the movie jacket. I would rate this movie no stars, if they gave me the option."
3,"Enjoyed the book, endured the movie","Having been entertained by Diane Johnson's novel, I braved the criticism and went to see the film. Admittedly, there were some delightful visual tidbits that almost made the film worth seeing. The imagery was clever. However, the film story possessed none of the wit, whimsy or intelligence of the written story. It made no sense. Some of the acting was bad; Kate Hudson failed to portray the hysterical and wise Isabel Walker. The cultural criticism was flabby and played heavily into stereotypes."
1,BORE,"This movie was teased as a comedy, anything but. No story and characters you never care about. Major disappointment and total waste of time."
4,"Underrated, lovely film","Fantastic cast, beautifully filmed in gorgeous settings. I think that people find it a little jarring because it's set in the present day, where as most of us are accustomed to the grand Merchant-Ivory period pieces. Let's be honest; Americans just aren't as interesting in a Merchant-Ivory film as Brits or, in this case, the French. I haven't read the novel, but the film perfectly depicts the cultural differences, and also skillfully intertwines them with the generation gap between the young heroines and their parents, uncles, aunts, etc. Yes, it's arguable that the depiction of the French relies too heavily on stereotypes...but who can honestly claim there's no truth there? The French love of style, of romance, of fine cuisine, and their sense of superiority--I find no cause for offense. The film is lovely, the plot interesting, the acting divine."
2,Cheap Imitation.,"This latin jazz dvd is a mediocre extraction from the afro cuban genre. Unlike the afro cuban style of long versions with cadenzas where musicians take the oportunity to show off their skills in different instruments. The campesino music such as ""son montuno, juaguiro and cubano"", as well as ball room compositions such as danzon, cha cha cha and mambo are also absent. The genre in this dvd is taken from the caribean concept known as salsa. If you want to enjoy afro cuban music, purchase Buenavista Social Club. Amazon. com has a much larger selection of cuban music than Virgin Records."
3,An alright book,"I somewhat enjoyed this book about Bobby Darin. It was not my favorite of all the books I have read about him. It skims the surface, but does not ever get 'deep' into the subject. It is a good look at Bobby if you know nothing about him and are just starting to explore the genius of Bobby, but not my first choice of all the books about him."
5,Classic kid's book,Sixty plus years familiarity with this one made it a perfect gift for my book-loving grandson. It is a sweet story of parental/familial love starring walruses. Sorry it's out of print but I got a good used copy. Story is what counts.
2,You'd better like small needles and cotton yarn,"This book is very disappointing! Although the patterns are lovely and timeless, the vast majority of them are done in cotton yarn with very small needles. If you enjoy knitting with worsted weight yarn, forget this book unless you enjoy rewriting patterns.On top of this, everything is graphed, even plain knit & purl patterns. All of the graphs are shown in such a small scale that you would go blind trying to follow them and some of them spread over two pages. In addition, the graph lines in between every tenth one are very faint. If you want to use these graphs, it is essential that you have a scanner and computer program to enlage them. Of course you will have to print them out over several overlapping pieces of paper and hope the tiny graph lines show up - or write them all out by hand!"
5,LISTEN AND LEARN,"As my husband is a jazz aficionado, it has long been my hope to educate myself in this genre. Through the years of listening with him, I have picked up some rudimentary knowledge of jazz and its premier practitioners (past and present). However, this collection has afforded me a master's class in ""Classic Jazz"". It contains a vast and varied representation of the earliest development of jazz. Great artists included here are: Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Thelonious Monk, Dexter Gordon, and numerous others. Most significantly, the majority of the selections are the signature songs of these jazz luminaries. It would have been difficult and expensive to compile each of these selections singly. If you are ""into jazz"" or just an ecletic music lover, this should be a part of your music library."
1,Piece of junk,"moved into new house 7 years ago. House had the predescessor to this model installed. 5 out 12 were bad.Had to replace 6 of these in the last 3 years - false alarms, chirps on full battery). Going to try First A;ert next. Kidde needs to check into these."
1,JUNK,"I was forced to give this a star. So it gets a star, because I had to. It gets a star because it's a fire alarm and I'm sure it has the best intentions, but everyone is right, these things are crap. Mine started going off ALL DAY, on and off, for hours and hours and hours. I replaced the batteries, that helped the beeping BETWEEN when the alarms were going off, but not the alarms themselves. I wasn't even cooking! The heat wasn't on! there was no fire! Pushing the ""hush"" button only works half the time. I finally unhooked them from power AND took the batteries out. Listen to me and these other people when we say do not waste your time with these horrible machines. Absolutely absurd. Big shout out to my contractor for choosing this particular brand to install in our newly renovated home. Looks like he definitely did his homework."
1,"If you like to be woken up at 2 AM for no reason, buy this smoke detector.","I've had 5 of these interconnected smoke alarms for a little less than 3 years. Right now it's 1:30 AM on the East Coast and me and my wife and two small children have just been awoken in the middle of the night by a false alarm for the eight or ninth time. I can only imagine how often these things fail in the daytime when we are not home. For some reason the only time they go off is when you are sleeping. I've tried everything to rectify; including lithium backup batteries ... to no avail. They are super easy to install and super easy to change the battery and super LOUD but they are all interconnected so one false alarm leads to 5 (I have 5 in my house.) blaring smoke alarms and there is no way to know which one is faulty.Do yourself a favor, select a different smoke alarm and sleep soundly at night."
1,Smoke alarms at 2 am for no reason,"Our electrician installed 4 of these in our new home a couple of years ago. A couple of weeks ago they all went off at 1 am. We ignored it for a while and it stopped. Then it went off again at 2 am. We pulled out the ladder to get to the 14 foot ceilings, and disconnected them. The next day we replaced all the batteries. One week later we went through the same fire drill in the middle of the night. I'm going to find a different brand!"
1,Constant chirping,"The alarm constantly chirps every 30 - 40 seconds. It indicates a low battery but, a fresh battery makes no difference. I can't live with constant chirping and don't trust it to work anyway. It only lasted about 18 months. Don't buy this model and/or brand. It's junk."
3,"Great product, trouble shipping","I love these, they taste great, and have lots of good stuff in them. However, if you are ordering in hot weather there is a likelyhood that they will arrive melted into a big lump. So use caution when ordering."
4,Pretty watch,The watch is very pretty. Already had to replace the battery after only a couple of weeks. The watch seems to be working fine now.
4,Abrazar La Vida -,"La mas nueva produccion de Luis Fonsi, y como sus grabacionesanteriores, este disco tambien es un ""ganador"". Los temas""Quien te dijo eso?"" y ""Abrazar la vida"", los primeros dos temas del disco, sin ninguna duda van a dejar huella.""Yo Te Propongo"", tema con ritmo caribeno/tropical, no se queda atras. Es contagioso, y te dan ganas de bailar.Este disco ya forma parte de mi coleccion.Fonsi: Congrats! You've done it again."
5,Just love it!!!!!,"I was really surprised that I never heard of this orchestra. Thanks to ""Classic Arts Showcase"" I heard them play ""Number 1-4 and immediately went to Amazon to get a recording. I suppose if I had seen ""Happy Feet"" I would have heard ""Air a Danser"". Now, I can't get it out of my mind. Their music seems so soothing and happy at the same time. What a treat!!!!!"
3,it's alright,"the stickers look pretty good.. but the ""gems"" fall off within a week.. also.. the ""gems"" might deviate from the sticky backing... allowing the exposed sticky back to pick up dirt"
3,Baldwin not bad,HAIKU MOVIE REVIEW: Better read the book. Real Bo better than Baldwin. But Balwin not bad.
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought this one year ago and I am already looking for a new one. The biggest annoyance is the automatic feeder, which by the way you have to babysit, it likes to grab 2 to 10 sheets at a time. The power button is on it's way to jamming in either the on or off position. I have yet to figure out the best way to hook up the fax machine so that it works with my phone voice mail ( that could be my shortcomings) so I don't except incoming faxes. Oh and it only wants to fax out one out of every three times. Scanning is a bit annoying, I wanted to scan in newpaper articles well the flat part of the scan bed is not big enough. Overall it prints okay, slightly slow. I would give it one star, but atleast it lasted one year."
1,I hate this piece of junk with a holy passion!,"DO NOT BUY! I bought this thing thinking I was getting a deal. What I got was a constant headache! For starters it harasses you every time....i repeat....EVERY TIME you print. It bombards you with messages wanting you to join lexmark connect. Another popup wans you to order their ink. Oh and if you have the audacity to use off label ink you will be harassed by popups warning you that you will void the warranty and it will show the ink as empty and keep warning you as such. It freezes often, accepts faxes less often, is noisy, and the paper jams all the time. I am convinced that Satan himself designed and manufactured this thing. Keep your money and buy something else....DO NOT SELL YOUR SOUL! Anyone who rated this more than a one star either a) has not had it but one day or b) is smoking crack."
4,climax blues band,was not a bad cd started early in career ended well alot of music here. if you like to try new things and never heard this group give it a try
3,hard to find music,"The best song on this for me was ""I LOVE YOU"", however I havent found this song anywhere else. so I paid the extra money just for that song.As for me, some of these songs suck. But to get the song I wanted I had to buy this whole thing. You will have to decide for yourself if its worth the price you pay."
3,"some good songs, but where's the rest?","this cd has some of the great songs from spongebob, like the sbsp theme song, the ripped pants song and the pre-hibernation instrumental by pantera(rock on!) but where are the other great songs from the show? the cd is only 9 min lone! Wheres that great rock ballad from the bubble dome? or some of the ukelale music thats constantly playing in the backround. also, they should highlight some of the especially funny clips from the show and include them as well, even just to fill more space than 9 min! there should be a more lengthy second season cd"
2,Ugh...there is SO much missing from this CD,"Okay, I didn't REALLY buy this album, but I've listened to a few tracks and this is a terribly disappointing CD. What I wanted was to hear the score to the show! As another reviewer said, that funky mandolin type music that plays through most of the episodes. THAT'S what I want, not these original songs!Oh well, here's to hoping some sort of music producer hears my wish..."
4,"Great CD, lacking a few songs","I have not heard this CD, yet I have heard all the songs that areon it. I have always wanted a SpongeBob CD, but this isn't what Iexpected. It doesn't have ''A Stove is a Stove, A Patty is a Patty'' or ''Sweet Victory'' from the band episode."
2,Pantera is awesome,pre hibernation is the only song on the album i will listen to. because it is cool and it is by Pantera (one of my favorite bands).
4,good listening,I got this cd brand new. It has a few songs from the show. Great songs it just dont have that many!
3,Spongebob soundtrack cd reveiw,It could have had more songs like swwet victory and livin in the sunlight livin in the moonlight. But it also has some of those forgotten songs like The Texas song. Grest song but no one evr remembers it exept when they see it on spongebob. So its pretty good but they should make a second cd.
3,two problems,"This was a great C.D. only it could be better. Heres why:1. This C.D is 8 minutes long.2. It only has 7 tracks. They forgot about sweet victory, the song on the first episode, end credits, patricks family song. It is really 11, but insted they put 7."
2,no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"NO! They forgot like every song, including my Favouroites Jellyfishjam and Sweet Victory!Here is what they forgots.The Striped SweaterMermaidman smellsJellyfish JamSweet VictorySquidward likes patrick moreThis Christmad=s feels like the very first Christmas to meThe song sponge and Gary used to bring the Jellyfish to the jellyfish feildsThe Mussel beach songMermaidman and Barnacal boy song"
5,Fantastic little kit,"I bought this kit for my husband to keep upstairs in the house. He's always complaining about needing a screwdriver or hammer and all the tools are downstairs in the garage. This is the perfect tool kit. It have everything you might need for small things around the house plus room to add a few extras of your own. The case is much smaller than I anticipated, which is even better. This is a great buy."
2,"Helpful, but very repetetive","The book has good information and is clearly written, but much of the information is repeated from section to section. The author covers security in one OS, then copied and pasted paragraphs at a time into security about another OS. Very annoying to re-read sections over and over. There is one two paragraph pasage that I have read five times in different parts of the book."
1,Don't Wast Your Time Or Money,"This is a terrible ""unauthorized"" video. There is no actual Springsteen music in the vd since it is unauthorized. The makers just basically interview 2 or 3 former band mates of Springsteen's from the very early days. What a piece of garbage this movie is. Not worth two bucks. Spend a couple more and get a dvd of concert footage or an authorized production that actually has some of the Bosses music in it."
4,Light duty - Good enough for the price,"I bought the keyed version about 5 or 6 years ago. It provided good service, so good that I didn't have to buy a new drill in 6 yrs; however, the batteries do drain too fast and are quite expensive (altough the life of the batteries was 6 yrs!!!). I'm considering on buying a new 9.6 V cordeless Black and Decker Drill for almost the same price as the batteries though ..."
3,may be the best album! but not the best line up!,"this 1987 Whitesnake album is not the best line up,...though could be the best album ever made...I do not like this new 1987 line up. I still prefer the old Whitesnake line up along with John Lord, Coverdale, Ian Paice (ex three members of deep purple line up)"
2,Where Is The Music...Terrible Recording.,Sad to say this concert was Poorly Recorded.I have a Great Sound System and I was really expecting to hear some Great Music.I went to an Everly Brothers Concert at Circle Star many years ago and the sound is Terrible there but at least the Band Sounded Nice and Tight.On this Show Alvin Lee and the Boys seem to be shuffling through these Songs which actually does not make a difference since the Band Sound on this DVD is Terrible.Just a Bad Recording.I wonder who Mastered this Concert they should be Fired.The only Plus is Phil and Don's Vocals are worth it.
5,Great Concert,I really love this DVD of the Everly Brothers. They sung most of their greatest hits on this concert. The audio and video was excellent. I am recommending this DVD to all fans of the Everly Brothers.
5,The Isleys rock out...,"This is one solid set. ""Fight The Power"" has a great groove and chorus. There is impressive guitar work throughout, notably the solo at the end of ""Hope You Find Better Love"". My favorite song off this one continues to be ""For The Love Of You"". This is an R&B classic that never gets old. The Isley Brothers really put it together on this disc and I never get tired of it."
4,3rd ed Monster Manual,"A must for all DM's wanting to run a 3rd edition campaign. An excellent tool for any DM wanting to add some challenging monsters to his players' encounters. This book has some great artwork, and many of the monsters are new and improved so players will have to rethink some old strategies."
5,Monsters Monsters Everywhere,"This book is the final core book needed to run a successful 3rd Edition campaign. Interesting and useful new monsters. Lost of old favorites. Not sure how the monster PC's will work out, but it should be exciting. A must have source book! A+++"
3,Badly needing revision,"Good art and descriptions, hard as heck to find any creatures that you're familiar with. Could use a good index."
1,Outdated Concepts and Information,Worst book ever on the subject with a misleading title. A combination of old material and sales brochures.
1,"Curtain, but no plastic liner","Come on it's like putting a sheet up.There was no liner, so what good is it?"
2,(Un)Imaginary Blandscapes,"Being a huge fan of Eno's music and his methods of making that music, I thought this might be an interesting peek inside the life and/or mind of this talented musician/producer. Nope. The film starts off with promise in that you do see Eno in his studio dicussing sounds, ideas, etc. It then begins the first in a series of increasingly irritating (in my mind) ""landscape"" shots with his music playing over the top. You may get a snippet of conversation here and there, but it mostly is just bad films of open highways, clouds and scenery shot from a car with his music over the top. I fell asleep the first time I watched it. I tried again the next day thinking I was just tired. Nope. It's just that dull."
4,A good two-tone cd.,If you haven't heard too much from The Selecter then check out this cd. It's a pretty good cd with a lot of great tracks from their different albums.
5,A time machine,"This is a great collection. No longer does my record player work, so I'm happy to find this collection on a modern format! I've been lucky enough to see the Selecter live...and this just brings memories flooding back! Just check out the track listing to see that you're not short changed on those fave. hits!All I can say is buy this, invite some friends around, roll back that carpet and crank it up!"
3,The Selecter... be sleective...,"Don't get me wrong, The Selector rocks but this cd can get REALLY reduntant. Most of the songs sound the same. But it's a good cd to pick up if you want to get to know what they are like. So check them out."
5,A great movie with plenty of scares,"Okay, the director and the screen-writer are both first timers - and it shows in some parts, but Urban Legend is a clever, scary movie that keeps you guessing. I was geniunely shocked in the end, and the suspense just kept building. If they can do this well on their first movie, I can't wait to see their next!"
5,A whats going to happen next movie!,"None stop action and scares! Keeps you on your feet! After watching this movie, it makes you think whose next or now what will happen! I hope there is a part 2!"
1,AN INSULT TO THE SLASHER GENRE,"I thought that the scream films were a wake up call for the genre, but then along comes this complete dire rip off, that holds no promise what so ever. This is the biggest insult to the slasher genre, bad acting, bad directing, bad script, need I say more. It's films like this that give a bad name to film, it should be wiped off the planet, cause it's enough to make you physically sick!"
1,you must be joking?,"it amazes me the amount of movie lovers who think films such as this one deserve anything more than one star....honestly that whole cliched genre of Scream, I Know What you Did Last Summer, etc. are at the very lowest denominator of talent and cinema. They are the repulsive section of Hollywood that lack any emotional creativity in all its forms, and the movie going public that place Happy Gilmore and Mean Girls on their top ten list, and with IQ's less than 20, are the ones who make films like these gross the amount of money they do.There is NOTHING, mediocre, or even 'fair' about Urban Legend. It sinks beneath the yoke and is one of the worst films ever created. Pure excrement."
2,Wannabe Scary Movie to the extreme!!!,What a horrible movie that makes us dumber by the second...I have never seen a movie which treats its viewers like such idiots..Also the dog in the microwave was about as tasteless as it gets!!! Poor movie with very little talent!
2,Another Scream clone,A group of young college students get stalked by a killer obessed with making urban legends reality. This movie had a good enough story but made it to much like any other Scream clone. Very pradictably all the way through and a hopeless ending. Very disappointing.
2,Scary in unique ways.,"I found the most frightening thing about this movie the fact that so many viewers think that it was some sort of mystery. A mystery story requires continuity and hints that allow the viewer to accurately discover the villain. This movie has no such continuity and one guess is as good as the next. The true killer is an impossibility. We are expected to believe that a 5'2"" tall 95 pound woman can physically overpower all these victims? Sheesh!This movie continues the 'tradition' of Scream. Cobble together a crazy-quilt 'plot' where there are no real clues to solve the question and pretend that it's a mystery.Still, it's better than the Fridaythe13th type of movies. give it two stars."
2,"Silly and ""overpredictable""","Sill, silly movie. Which would be fun if it weren't so predictable. I knew the killer less than FIFTEEN MINUTES after the opening, and this is one of those films where you're supposed to learn who the killer is only in the very end. Even Robert Englund cannot save this movie with others acting so bad. And speaking of bad actors: who is that character killed in the very beginning, the one driving the car in the rain? She has to be the worst ""actress"" I have ever seen. She can't do ANYTHING, she can't speak, she can't sing, she can't walk, and she most certainly couldn't act even if she took 1000 acting classes. If you think you've seen a bad, wooden actress, take a look at this one... Apart from the quite good, ambient score, there is one good thing about this movie (probably especially for a non-American viewer :) - you learn a good deal about nice urban legends."
3,"Sassy,Sexy,Scary!","Well what can i say, im not a big Horrer fan but this just like the 1st Scream had a really good storyline and everyone knows the legends coz most people grow up being told them on school camps or from older siblings trying to freak them out. my favorite Legend is the one about the guy hanging from a tree over the car while the girl is like freaking out, most people have heard some version of that one, for example that legend is the topic of conversation in the one of the opening scenes of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER Remember the beach scene just before they kill the fisher dude! URBAN LEGEND ITS A SCREAM!"
3,Robert Englund shines through!,"What I liked about this SCREAM rip off (forgive me for saying) was that it featured Robert (FREDDY)Englund, Brad (Chucky) Douriff and 2 sexy babes, Tara Reid (return to salems lot) and Danielle Harris (Halloween 4-5)This film had a clever twist like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.. but it seems too close to the age of those films, like a copycat. Robert Englund makes a good if somewhat small part to this film."
1,"""Where's that FSTFWD button?""","Do you like fast-forwarding movies? Do you get off on watching your movies triple speed? Well then my little teeny boppers, this is the film for you! What starts off as an intriguing premise to a movie (pop rocks and soda: a deadly combination, looking in the mirror and saying ""bloody mary"" over and over) these are all things I grew up hearing as a kid, so the fascination was there! And when I heard they were centering a horror movie around this plot of plots I thought cool! This is gonna make an awesome movie! Well sheesh! Boy was I wrong!Like this and all it's pseudo predessors, once again they screw up a potentially horrific horror flick! They just don't know how to make grotesque horror movies anymore! Where was the element of suspense, the eye-popping gore?!?I finally got so fed up I just fast forwarded the damn thing hence the title!"
1,"Studio says ""no plans""","The people who have seen it in these reviews must have seen the VHS version. Here's a recent e-mail exchange I had with Image Entertainment:MY MESSAGE:Many on-line DVD vendors (including Amazon) have been listing a series called ""Rock Masters"" from your studio for some time now, with confusing information as to release dates. Some of the titles include The Cure, AC/DC, and The Police, and the listings include such details as the song titles. Can you confirm that you have plans to release these DVDs in the future, or can you provide any information at all about these releases?THEIR RESPONSE:Thank you for your inquiry. At this point in time Image Entertainment does not have any plans regarding the release of any titles from the ""Rock Masters"" series on DVD. However, I will pass your email onto our acquisitions department which will look into the possibility of releasing these titles on DVD at some point in the future.Thank you."
4,perfect for conduit,I'm an electrician by trade and this blade is perfect for conduit. It works better in higher rpm saws doesn't throw as much metal. Can't beat it for the price.
5,"Terrific material on Red Scare, Women in Politics, Nixon.","I enjoyed this book enormously, extremely well-researched, clear and well-written, entertaining, scrupulous in detail and true to the mark. There's a lot of new ""dirt"" on Nixon but what is perhaps most valuable is the portrait of Helen Douglas as one of the most remarkable (though flawed) women of the century. Also a powerful depiction of the Red Scare in Hollywood....Really, a must read!"
2,Not User Friendly,"These cards have a finish that does not allow for easy dealing or handling. Ours were stiff and did not become flexible with use, as we had hoped. I donated them to GoodWill and purchased a well-known brand (Bicycle). What a difference!"
4,V-1 Flying Bomb,"This book deals with the V-1 Flying Bomb,from its inception,its development,and its strugle to become an operational weapon of terror.This is a very short paged book with excellent color diagrams and period b/w photos;a good introductory book."
3,the man with two left feet and other stories,I didn't know to much about the book when I purchased it. I read a small part before.The book itself is easy to read. The stories are short. Its a good bedtime book. The stories flow every easy.They are based on an earlier time. It puts you in a simpler time.
1,Don't bother,"I got this software free with my computer. For the simple task of burning CDs, every time I'm in the middle of dragging songs over to the Track Layout area, the system says it's encountered an error and shuts the whole thing down without saving anything. I've maybe made 2 successful CDs with it (out of countless attempts), but not without some frustration and restarting a couple times. It's horrible software. Also, there's no way to edit tracks at all, like making songs shorter, fade out, etc. So annoying. Don't bother."
2,Gets dirty fast and beeps,"Evidently the sensor area on this detector gets dirty very easily, and once it is dusty/dirty it's starts to beep. You can clean it out with canned air, but it's still annoying how unprotected the sensor area is."
4,You will love the taste!,Very tasty! You can make a pie with this and freeze and then throw some whipped cream on top when ready to serve. Your family will forever love you!
1,Poorly done,"Have the book and was a waste of money.I would not recommend it to any quilter, especially a beginner as there are no project directions."
2,"cute idea, but...",I didn't read closely enough to see that it doesn't actually come WITH a mug. Had trouble getting it to fit snugly on mugs I already had. Only works on smaller ones.
1,The S/H charge drops it from cute to a joke.,Almost purchased this item until I realized that I was going to pay twice as much in shipping and handling as I would for the mug boss. The Mug Boss is cute but that isn't funny.
5,Wonderful gift (and practical too!),"This is a great little gift, which has some practicality to it. The little outside pockets work pretty well... great for the carpenter (or those that dream to be one!)"
5,Bucket Brand Mug Boss,I received the Bucket Brand Mug Boss as a gift. It is adjustable so it fits any size mug. I put it on a one pint wide mouth mason jar were it sits on my desk at work.
3,Period piece,"In WWII England the remaining members of an upper class family eke out a living giving tours of their formerly grand but now run down house. In the course of the novel we learn about the house, the family, the servants, and the visitors. The plot (what there is of it) is inconsequential but the details are nicely sketched in. A very nice read if you're a fan of country houses. Don't pay more than a dollar or two."
4,STIR FRY WONDER,I purchased this wok for a small cook-out.I got raved reviews for the stir fry that it produced.I will surely get many meals from it.....Great product!!!!!!
1,A waste of money,"Not at all what I expected. I should have bought one from Chinatown.1) Wok is only ~4 inches tall, not deep2) Wok material is questionable and I would hesitate to use for cooking food3) Lid is too small and not as picturedI took a LOSS returning the item.1) Paid for shipping2) Paid for return shipping3) Refund less 25% restocking feeAGAIN, DO NOT BUY!!! Learn from my mistake."
2,A Somewhat Useful Book for Beginning Writers,"The Internet Writer's Handbook is just that--a handbook. As such, it's not something you'll be reading or spending much time with. But that's a good thing, because this rather expensive book is very cheaply made and violates every rule of page layout its author attempts to teach. Pages are so busy and painful to look at that I'm rarely tempted to pick it up. The information is sound but basic. Much of it is typical freshman comp handbook stuff in Web-style disguise. The high price of this book makes even its good points sting a little. Bottom line: If I could have seen The Internet Writer's Handbook before I bought it, I wouldn't have considered it--especially at [the price] plus shipping."
2,A Disappointing Odd Movie.,"This wasn't a completely bad film, but it wasn't great either. Was at times quite hard to understand LV's mother for one. Just before or after the first hour had transpired, I was still a bit confused about what was going on. The film's plot was okay, but I just didn't enjoy this movie that much. Little Voice was a bit too flat and didn't achieve much."
4,We're doing it all wrong,Research shows that what we know in our hearts is true. What the state forces us to do through testing takes us totally in the opposite direction of what helps children to learn most. Lot's of good insights in this book; I am still reading it.
5,nice watch,i got this watch as a gift for my birthday from my friend. This watch is awesome! its measures the calorie loss and its titanium made which means it will last.the only complaint i have is that the belt tend to come lose if pulled too hard.. i guess this is normal for any watch.. but i'd appreciate if the belt is made of something stronger that it won't come lose.
5,An excellent title but...,"This is NOT for rank beginners by any stretch. The majority of the book provides a number of two bar rhythms to practice along with 8th and 16th note hi-hats. Almost all of the beats require a good 16th note ability on bass and snare drum and if you haven't got this down yet, this is the wrong book for you.While I definitely recommend this book as an excellent volume, I suggest Jim Payne's Funk Drumming book as a precursor. It will take you to where this book really begins.Also, this volume is NOT set up anything like Pickering's Studio Jazz book (which I also own and highly endorse). So if you already own that volume, expect a very different approach from this one."
1,"Worst ""professional"" movie we have ever seen!!","My wife and I watched this together one evening and found ourselves laughing at how bad it was from top to bottom.The worst acting, writing, and cinematography in a film made by professionals that we have ever seen!! There MAY be worse b-movies or low grade independents than this, sure,but in the 10 years we've been watching films together we haven't seen one that rivals this for all around bad and we have seen a LOT of films. Still most reviewers at this site love this film, so tastes are very different. It is suspicious though, that at one site I check which has reviews of most everything the last several years that has been released on video, this film is absent. I think I know why!!"
2,Dissapointing!,"I love Stephen Dillane which is why I picked this movie. His performance was very good but the overall movie was weird and jerky. The ""no script"" thing shows how important a script is. I hope the director bagged that idea after this movie. It is painfully apparent when Stephen Dillanes character runs into Victoria Foyt's character at the house in London, she just keeps saying ""what are you doing here?"" and Dillane doesn't respond. The bedtime conversations between the old couple that owns the house are just plain weird and completely irrelevant. I agree with the other reviewer that Victoria Foyt's character comes off incredibly whiney! The other story lines - Vanessa Redgraves - would have meaning if they were in turn experiencing some sort of Deja Vu but they don't. I would pass on this movie, this director and certainly Victoria Foyt."
2,won't stay together,My son is 4 and was so frustrated with this toy because it would not stay together. It's kind of hard to push a car down a ramp that falls apart every 2 minutes. I got tired of him crying over it and I'm returning it. This is also the 3rd or 4th set like this--we also had a car wash and a car dealership that I threw out for the same reason. They are just junk.
1,"For shame, Prentice Hall!","First read ""Sorely Disappointed"", and then add this to that excellent review:Avoid this blatant and failed attempt to do no more than fill a hole in a pubisher's lineup.This slender, shallow and derivative work is bulked up not only with two pages of appendix for every page of text, most of which is available from Microsoft in the online documentation, but it continues to insult the intellience of the purchaser by declaring on the back cover:""The accompanying CD-ROM contains code examples covering the material discussed in the book""Instead, the reader gets a 7 mb grab-bag of C++/C# code, some dlls, and a few readmes. Not one single example keyed to the text.Of course to get anyone to buy this book, they had to be able to to say, ""See, we have a CD!"".Yes, and they have words on a page too. But you can do better with your money."
5,Treasure of a Find!,"This is one of the best desert puddings available. With the addition of an egg yolk, as the package directions suggests, the pudding tastes exactly like the best home made custard. I can't imagine why someone would think the few minutes required to stir it until it boils isn't worth the time for this special treat. I have missed this product for over several years, since it disappeared from grocery shelves. What a wonderful surprise to discover it available on-line from Amazon. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You are providing a service that the local ""mom and pop"" grocery used to do but the big, or even ""Giant"" mega ""open 24 hours"" stores can't because the corporate computer won't OK the order. Thanks for preserving goodness and keeping us from being totally possessed by the Great Mediocrity""."
1,Exceptionally Lame Construction,"I have a similar lamp without the magnifier. But mine has the same body construction, which is awful. The body is swing arm is made of plastic and breaks easily. I'm very handy and tried to repair it a couple times; but it's just beyond repair. The light itself is great. But without an arm to keep the light in the air, it's just a piece of junk. It's not very helpful if your light is at the same height as the lamp base -- what a waste of money!"
3,Not as good as Partion Magic but it does work on Vista!,"I bought this to do more partion management than Vista provides and my old program, Partion Magic, does not play well with Vista. It works fairly well but there are several things that it will not do like restore individual files or folders nor explore a saved image. Also you need to be aware that you need the latest version 10.1 because 10.0 doesn't work with Vista eithe!"
3,"Nice Look, not so comfy","I bought this shoe because I liked the look. It's a nice dress shoe, however the leather on the edge is hard and tends to rub on my ankle... shoe looks good when your standing up... but walking in it requires thick socks. Other than that the shoe is nice. I wouldn't suggest this shoe for the office..."
1,Three-Piece Value Combo Pack for Nokia 6030,This earphone doesnt work. You can not hear anything with this.
2,Can find a better case,"When I received this in the mail, I realized the case with it's bulky outside seams wasn't what I wanted, so I bought a Krusell with the seams turned in, and I like that better. I had lost my earpiece and wanted the charger, and have had this for a couple years, and these pieces work fine."
4,Very effective,"i found this tape to be effective. i was very disappointed by side A since the music really is not good and i don't see the point to listening to bad music... how is it supposed to increase concentration? however, i use side A whenever i need to focus on something important and i find that in just three days, my concentration is more sharp."
5,I was satisfied.,"The book Programming Server-Side Applications for Microsoft Windows 2000, which I get looks quite new. Probably nobody read it before. Buying this book was a good deal for me. .... Thank you."
5,Great book,"I bought this book for one of our developers. We are just getting started on server side programming. He said it was the perfect book, and he couldn't put it down. I'm buying a second copy now."
3,Conspiring to make a so-so film,"An interesting opportunity to see the young Warren Beatty at work in a conspiracy flick that was probably dated the day it came out. For vastly better examples, see ""The Conversation,"" and even ""Three Days of the Condor."" Still, it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours."
2,Potential squandered by sloppy storytelling,"This revered '70s paranoia thriller strikes me as a major disappointment. It starts out promisingly with an intriguing conspiracy plot, but director Alan J. Pakula is simply a lousy storyteller. His sense of pacing is terrible--scenes go on for far too long, often while we don't really understand what is happening in them, and then cut abruptly to something new. Parts of the film that are intended to be suspenseful register as dull and confusing. This does have its compensations; Pakula and the great DP Gordon Willis create some striking visual compositions, Warren Beatty does a nice job with his underwritten role, and the famous brainwashing montage is terrific. But the story is too incoherent to deliver the goods as a thriller, and the movie never recovers from Pakula's narrative indifference."
5,A Good 70's Conspiracy Thriller,"Not only is this a great early performance from Warren Beatty, who plays a rebellious, idealistic reporter going undercover as a sociopath seeking to join an organization of government trained assassins, it is a first-rate example of action-suspense filmmaking. The eerie soundtrack music is especially effective, creating a mood that is by turns sinister and mournful.What made this film one of my all time favorites is a ""movie-within-the-movie"" about halfway through. Beatty's character goes to a sort-of character screening as he attempts to join Parallax Corp., and as part of the 'audition' he must watch a bizarre 3-4 minute film of images and sounds while his vital signs are monitored. It is a brilliant concept, brilliantly executed.For anyone who loves a tragic underdog fighting a war that you just know the poor guy can't win, this movie would make a welcome addition to your collection."
4,RELAX WITH PARALLAX ?,"Another all but forgotten hit of the 1970's, beautifully photographed with a mature (but fantastic) script. Maverick reporter Beatty,along with hundreds of others,witnessed an assassination of a U.S. Senator 3 years earlier. Despite Official U.S. investigations to the contrary, people who were present at the shooting are dying pell-mell, and Beatty's out to investigate Parallax, much to the chagrin of his boss, Cronyn. Beatty is convinced that this organization trains ""hit-men"" to carry out ""big-wig"" murders,then covers them up with more murders.A movie not for ths faint of heart, it's also an indictment of pro- forma investigations that fail in their duty, and waste huge amounts of taxpayer money as well.By all means, see this movie which is really timeless in nature."
4,XM for Motorcycle,The Delphi SA10102 SkiFi Vehicle Adapterkit works well for motorcycle installationalso. I installed this on a SuzukiBergman 400. The SkiFi fits in theglove box well. It adapts to a Bluetoothtransmitter also well. This transmits toa bluetooth wireless receiver in my helmit.I now enjoy XM on the motorcycle on the wayto work.
4,It Works,"It works. It doesn't do anything more than it was made to do. Can't say much else about it. Delphi makes good radios but the accessories are cheaply made and they don't last long. I should have bought two of these. I'll be needing another one eventually. UPDATE (Nov. 18, 2007): The antenna connection has come loose and the unit will need replacing. Well, at least I got a year out of it."
4,The Mayor of Strawberry Fields,Very interesting film about a quirky character and his dedication to serving the memory of John Lennon's 'Imagine' memorial with his own style of artistic commitment on a daily basis. This is made even more intriguing due to the fact that Gary is homeless and managing his own struggles to survive in New York's Central Park every day. Great music too!!
5,A brilliant must-have for any Beatles fan,"Not just any Beatles fan, but any music fan. ""The Mayor"" brings together images from one of NYC's most famous landmarks, and it is done in a way that honors Lennon, Gary and Central Park perfectly. Torre has an incredible future ahead of him, so take the opportunity to get in on the ground floor."
2,"boring, but well made","Maybe our son is too young to enjoy this toy, (he's not yet 2) but he has banged it once or twice with vigor, though not quite hitting the nail on the head. In any case, it requires a lot of power to really drive those pegs into the board. This is good and bad. The pegs don't get lost, but that's because it takes a strong kid to whack 'em all the way through. Very durable and well made, though kinda small sized."
4,Anime Action With Heart,"Armitage III contains many things Anime fans have been bragging about for years: Futuristic surroundings, technology and situations; slamming action; and mature subject matter. However, it contains what some Anime films lack, heart and a well-dubbed english track. Of all the Anime films i have seen lately, this one has the best music, and english dubbing i have heard. The plot surrounds an Earth cop who travels to Mars to leave a painful memory. On Mars, he meets a young female cop named Armitage. They work together to solve a murder mystery that may destroy the very fabric of two planets' cultures.Recommended!!!"
4,really decent anime,"man has colonized mars are are using robots called second types to do the tedious jobs man dont want to do.theres other robots called third types devoloped without the populations knowing about it.these bots look and act just like real people.then meet noami armitage(elizibeth berkly)a third type,who is also a police officer.when third types start getting assasinated noami starts asking why.with the help of detective Ross Sylibuse(Kiefer sutherland)there off on a quest to find the assassins and to find out why third types were made anyway.The voice overs played by berkley and sutherland are great,but what this anime did lack was propper written diolouge,it just to well ""cheezy"" (i hate that word).other than that its great the 5.1 surround is great the drawings of the mars citys are just awsome and the picture quality is also good.i'll be expecting some more good anime in the future from Pioneer.get this one it compliment any anime collection."
2,Terrible,"I really don't understand how this movie could gather so many positive reviews. The movie has story-potential but gives it all away by telling it in an extremely boring and sometimes a bit confused way. Next point would be the animation itself. Absolutely nothing special, but that's alright. The characters: I never found a protagonist in a movie as unpleasant as Armitage. She's just annoying. The dubbing wasn't helpful at that point. Oh and by the way: The dialogs are REALLY BAD, especially in this 'love scene' when I didn't know if I should laugh or throw over. The only cool thing about it was the city most of the story took place in. Very cool."
2,Skip This -- Get The OAV,"There are tons of great reviews for this movie. That's understandable if none of them have seen the original OAV series this came from. See, back in 1994-1995, a 4-part OAV series called ""Armitage III"" came out in Japan. ""Poly-Matrix"" takes that 140-minute series and hacks it down to ~90-minutes. Thus this 1997 dub-title is born. So a lot of the story gets cut and things aren't nearly as good as the original. If you've seen the original, you'll be annoyed at all of the cuts and poor edit choices.As to the dub cast (there is no Japanese cast on a dub-title as they simply re-edit an original Japanese product for American consumption), having big stars lend their voices makes it a better dub than a lot of anime titles/series. But it doesn't make up for the complete and utter hack job the series was given to form this movie.Bottom line: If you thought this was good, the OAV is tons better. If you haven't seen this, get the OAV instead."
4,great emotion,"this moie is takes place on mars, many years in the future. Humans created robots called ""thirds"" that actually have personalities and emotions. Armitage is a third, and a sassy cop, but her partner dosent know that. then humans are starting to kill the thirds, and so is this murderer, whos after Armitage. So she's trying to stay alive, and find out why she was created if her kind is being destroyed. Its a good movie, but there were some scenes in it only for mature audiences, and quite a bit of violence."
1,Attack of the Progressive Wannabees,"I have to be truthful here (and this is just my opinion), but if you are a big fan of progressive rock, you might find Starcastle a bit...uh, lame. While most Progresive Powerhouse Bands like Yes, ELP & Pink Floyd use artisic and sometimes abstract imagery, Starcastle seems to come off as poetic mush. Cheesy at best. Not everyone who owns a synthisiser and a copy of ""Autobiograpy of a Yogi"" has what it takes to make it in the art rock world. Even Kayak was better than this. If you liked this record in 1977...try listening again when you are older, and not so stoned. This slag did not stand the test of time...if it passed any test at all. In short, Starcastle sucked. They are the worst thing to happen to progressive rock since The Alan Parson's Project went Soft Rock. I give them one star because they actually made it past thier sophmore LP without being dumped by thier record company."
3,A Salutary Lesson,"Monkey on a Stick is a chilling account of the misuse of spiritual authority and charisma by Kirtananda Swami the head of New Vrindabin, a leading disciple of the founder of the Hare Krishna movement. What was most interesting was the ""fall downs"" of so many devotees - alcohol, sex, not following the regulative principles and having no appreciation of the spiritual qualities that Srila Prabhupada the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in the west expected them to maintain. Much has been revealed since this book - allegations of pedophilia, the jailing of Kirtananda and the excommunication and rehabilitation of New Vrindabin in ISKCON. It is a salutary lesson of the need for devotees to be honest, to take responsibility for themselves and of their community and this is a book for all Hare Krishnas to read and meditate on. Dhirasanta das"
4,Beautiful Afghan Patterns,This book has each pattern given with suggested brands of yarn for chosen textures and colors. Also a difficulty scale for each pattern so one can choose their own speed and ability. Lovely and often unusual patterns to opt for. Enjoy!!
3,too drunk on this album!,some good songs like Turkish song of the damned are spoiled by being too drunk or stoned. Could have been great...
3,Introspective look into the author's life,"Well written, even interesting, and ultimately depressing.If you are a Jonathan Franzen fan, this might be the look into his life you were waiting for. If not, I don't recommend this book.He comes across as a depressed lonely guy who hasn't found meaning in his life. He seems like a sweet person, and very thoughtful. The book is filled with a discontent and over-analyzation of the minutia of his life.There is no resolution ~ no joyful fulfillment, no inspiring turn around. In reading it, I wanted him to succeed, to find true joy, to finally feel at peace and at home in himself and the world. This didn't happen - and I felt flat and sad for him at the end. I've never read his other books, and now I don't want to."
5,mostly autobiographical,"Ok, I'll start with the disclaimer that I am a Franzen fan.This is quite different from his earlier collection ""How to be alone"". The essays in this one are apparently autobiographical and more or less go from his high school years till when his mother dies fifteen or so years later. The later essays, especially the last one, seem to have been written about the time he was either writing Freedom or outlining it as all the themes of Freedom are present. The essay on his participation in Fellowship (no ""the"") gets to Franzen's attraction to groups and other folks as well as his more or less constant running away from the same. There is also a lot on birds and bird watching and many ruminations on the fate of the earth. Lots of curmudgeonly rants along the way. If you liked Freedom and/or The Corrections you'll like this."
2,a paler shade of white,"What it's like to be white, adolescent and Midwestern and never get beyond your own stereotypes. The glimpses of his mother are very good. The time spent ruminating about Peanuts cartoons, a youth fellowship group, and an assortment of implausible schoolyard pranks never seem important enough for all the gravitas. Writing like this gives us WASPS a bad name."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I'm a huge Franzen fan and will read anything he writes, but this proved to be a little frustrating. I liked about four of the six in this collection, but even those weren't some of his best writing that he's done. It's still enjoyable, overall, but if you have never read Franzen's non-fiction, you'd do better to start out with 'How to Be Alone'. I just hope that he continues to publish non-fiction collections because, good or not, Franzen is still one of the best voices out there. Even mediocre Franzen is miles ahead of a lot of writers' best work."
1,Seasoning Problem,"Can someone tell me how to properly season this wok? I tried putting the wok on medium flame, and using a paper towel drenched in oil to wipe all the inside surface of the wok, and then reduced the heat to low and cooked the wok for 15 mins, but the wok is still really sticky feeling, and the food sticks to it as well. Can someone help me puhleese?"
5,Wok-King,"This is just what I have been needing for stir frying, etc. The wok(once seasoned) does a very fine job in cooking the meats and veggies. Plus the 14"" is just right for my family. Now, all I need is some great recipes to go along with a great wok.Bon Appetit!"
1,Pages missing!!!,"I bought this book new on amazon. I was reading one one the explanatory notes, which instructed me to turn to page 306 for a more in depth note. I turned to the back of the book, and to my surprise there was no page 306. In fact it went from about page 275 to page 309. The whole end of the play was missing! The pages were not ripped out, the book was printed without them. Reading the previous comments on this page, I see I am not the only one who had this problem. Take my advice and don't risk buying this edition. Choose a different publisher."
2,Richard III,"The book is sold at a bargain price, but the font is too small for easy reading, and the paper is of poor quality."
4,Richard III (folger library edition),"I chose this Folger edition of the play because I have used these editions ever since I was a drama student in high school. I always like the way the footnotes and definitions of obscure words are interspersed with each page of text. These are among the most readable editions because one can quickly find the footnotes while reading, without interrupting the reading to flip to another page. Footnotes tend to be very small in print in some other editions, as well. The type set or font here is of a size that makes for ease in reading.Of course, one should read many of the fine editions of other paperback and hardbound publications of Shakespeare to get to know the plays in depth. But the Folger PB copies are well-priced, and a very good choice for a first reading of any play."
5,This CD made me love their music,"This CD runs the gamut from the driving Letter to the soulful I Met Her In Church, and the Box Tops do it all superbly. I have no idea why they never made it to the big time, for in my mind they are on par with the Beatles and Led Zeppelin as far as originality, depth, breadth, and musicianship go. It nearly killed me when my copy was stolen, and I plan to get another shortly."
5,One of the best metal singers on the planet,"Daniel Heiman is by far one of the most unknown, underrated metal singers today. He was known for his band Lost Horizon, which I think is amazing, but Heed is even better in my opinion. His voice is solid, with an amazing range, incredible screams and he has the ability to turn on a beautiful tone to change the flow of a song. What's great about Heed is it isn't like every other typical metal band in Europe who tries to rehash Priest or Maiden. They do their own thing and its great. if you like Lost Horizon you'll love Heed!"
5,Ä 'Ù'ó ìÀÌÀ ¿À ö ÀÖ' Ùü,"Lost Horizon¿Í' Ñ ÀÌÈ Ä 'Ù'ó! Heed Ñ¿ ÈÄ The CallÀÌ Ùü¿¡' À Ñ ¿ú ÖÀ éÀ ö ÀÖ Lost Horizon¿Í' ó'È 'Ù 'ÀÀÌ'Ù. È, 13 The FilghtÀ 15:30¿¡ ÀÀÖ' È ¿¡ HeedÀ À 'À ö ÀÖú'Ù. ÀüüÀÀ áñ À ¿ÁÖí ÀÖÀ ÀÀÀ ÀÈ ß' ÙüÀÌ'Ù."
4,Great sounds,Great songs from the middle of the ARS catalog of music. Hadn't heard some of these in quite a few years.
5,A DVD packed with lot's of extra's,"I recently rented the DVD version of this film(i got a copy early)First i would like to commend warner bros. for all the extra's included and highly recomend fans to check out the DVD version excellent directors commentary included and a great behind the scenes documentary. Now the bad news. I't may be just the copy i had but on chapters 23-26 on the DVD the movie jumped and skipped so bad i thought my DVD player had somthing wrong with it, at one pointe my DVD player shut down, so i immediatly took the DVD back to the video store and told the clerk about the problem i found. the clerk said he also had the same problem when he watched this DVD. so be forwarned maybe warner bros. will comment if there is a bug or flaw with this DVD disk, other than that this is a awesome! movie and the extra's are priceless."
5,Sometimes reality and fantasy meet in real life.............,"......and this movie is a great example of that. I met my husband through electronic mail and can vouch for the sweetness and romantic qualities of You've Got Mail. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are charming and endearing in this movie.It's also wonderful that they both have more scenes together than in the other five-star movie, Sleepless in Seattle. This is a light-hearted,romantic comedy that should be viewed by all."
1,You Got Mail (Deluxe Edition),I bought this from DVDLEGACY and I still didn't get my order ! It has been over a month. I am writing to DVDLEGACY and still no answer ! Don't buy from DVDLEGACY because your going to get ripped off !
5,One of the Best!,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom who absolutely loves this movie. It happes to be one of my favorites as well.
3,Good movie but skipped,I loved the movie but it skipped a lot while watching it. I've seen the movie before so I already knew what was going to happen it was just annoying because of the skipping.
4,A good romantic movie,It was nice watching a good clean movie for a change. Tom and Meg have the right stuff. Bring back more movies like this.
2,No longer Prime?,My wife really likes the movie and she likes to have it on a lot and had been streaming it with our Roku player. It was 'free' with Amazon Prime instant video subscription and all of the sudden it's not. What's up with that? Do some movies get taken off the Prime instant video list or if they get watched to many times is it no longer free?I'm not into this kind of movie but I think it's too bad it's not longer included in the yearly fee we already pay for Amazon Prime. I hope that this doesn't happen to other movies/TV we want to watch.
3,You've Got Mail,"This movie wasn't nearly as good as Sleepless in Seattle, although they tried to recapture the same feelings. The chemistry between Ryan/Hanks just wasn't there this time."
2,Good AOL commercial,This movie is entertaining enough to watch when it runs on TV. The story is full of cliches. I enjoy romance stories with some hint of realism. How could Meg Ryans be so clueless when her associate knows so many details about her? The scenes and characters are sweet enough for Hallmark. Real people are good and bad. These characters lack depth. I like Meg Ryans and Tom Hanks a lot so I give this 2 stars; one for each of them.
1,Manipulative Crap,"God is Meg Ryan obnoxious. Her idea of being appealing is bouncing on the balls of her feet like an 8-year-old. Blechh! A goody two-shoes like this does not exist, particularly in Manhattan.Speaking of which, what ""Manhattan"" was this? In this film, butterflies flit in subway cars. Come on, Miss Ephron, what do you take us for? The bookstore and their environs looked like Santa Barbara -- not NY.And Hanks really phoned this sucker in. What a dull performance. I saw zero evidence of the vaunted ""chemistry"" between the two principals.A cool, calculated (and I guess successful) attempt to bring women's dollars into the theater. Come on, ladies, wise up! Just because Hanks and Ryan are in it doesn't make this a good movie.Just Say No!"
4,Tom and Meg Come Through Once Again,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are our generation's Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Again and again they make an amazing on-screen couple. The chemistry between the two of them is remarkable and makes the movie.In this modern day Sleepless in Seattle, two people have been conversing through email. They discuss things as simple as butterflies on the subway. Over numerous emails this couple seems to be perfect for each other. Meanwhile the people behind their online alias are Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly. Two people which are both in the book business and naturally Joe Fox is trying to buy out Kathleen Kelly's bookstore.The online couple decide to meet in person where Joe Fox finds out it was Kathleen Kelly he was chatting with. He keeps this secret to himself and continues to converse. The ending is priceless and will cause all to cry with joy.This modern day romance movie is a great flix to see with family and even and great date movie. I recommend this to all ages."
5,True America's Sweethearts!,"If Sleepless in Seattle was any indication, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks have great chemistry and a knack for long-distance love. This time, the distance is fiber optic. The movie is built on anticipation and good character development with great characters to develop. Ryan's performance is exactly what you'd expect with her signature, every-girl (albeit beautiful), likable style. Hanks is witty and endearing as he always is despite the fact he plays the ""villain"" in this movie. This is a fun watch that won't leave you guessing, won't make you think particularly hard, and won't disappoint you for an evening of warm fuzzies and smiles."
4,A wonderful romantic movie!,"It took me awhile to get around to seeing this movie, but once I saw it-no regrets whatsoever. It was very heartwarming and had some funny scenes. This is one of those movies that make you feel good after you've seen it."
1,BLU-RAY REVIEW,"BLU-RAY ENDED UP BEING A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY... THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY NEW BLU-RAY COPY AND MY STANDARD DEF COPY. HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!!!GRAINY, DULL CINEMATOGRAPHY, LOOKS LIKE A CRAPPY UPCONVERTED PICTURE FROM THOSE OLD DVD PLAYERS THAT 'UPCONVERT' TO 1080. EVEN NATURAL LIGHT SHOTS (WHICH ARE USUALLY THE BEST) LOOK TERRIBLE.SO DISAPPOINTING."
1,Sentimental Dribble,"This film (if one would be so bold as to call it a ""film""; I should think ""garbage"" a more appropriate title) was quite frankly among the worst ever produced. I found it an insult to my considerable intelligence. The dialogue lacks wit (I'm sure the screenwriters could have thought of something more epigrammatical than ""You have mail"") and the characters lack depth. The film is inundated in sentimentality and posseses a mindless plot (if it could be said to possess a plot at all). Mr. Hanks wasted his considerable thespian talents on this project. Ms. Ryan, I can at least say, is not guilty of this charge; she has no talent to begin with. A dreadful waste of time. I would just as soon leap from the top of St. Paul's Cathedral than see it again.P.S. I understand that the sentiments expressed in my review may be unpopular ones. I live at 1567 Windsor Lane in London, England. Feel free to come to my home and personally disagree with me if you wish."
2,"Shop Around the Corner was a 5-star, what happened here?","I like Tom and Meg just as much as the next person, but isn't there supposed to be a flowing story in a movie that keeps the audience interested. The central idea why Tom and Meg fall for each other seems a lot more realistic in this movie than in Sleepless in Seattle, but it looks like they just threw the movie together. Personally, I usually like the more modern remakes like the new Sabrina and A Perfect Murder, but Shop Around the Corner is a nearly perfect movie that they destroyed with this picture. I will have to say that Meg put on her cuteness on its highest level and it was refreshing to see Tom in something fun rather than Saving Private Ryan or Philadelphia, but let's make their future project more like Sleepless in Seattle."
4,A good replacement,I order this movie as a replacement for an old video tape. The item arrived quickly and in good shape.
2,Very Slow Moving Story,"I had high expectations of this film, after all the press & hype it received when it was first released. The story concept was good, but it was extremely slow moving in many parts. I kept wondering how much longer before he let her know he was her online penpal. Sleepless In Seattle is a far superior movie, great storyline, characters you really care about & even the soundtrack is much better than the one for this film."
2,think its is wonderful,have seen this film and liked it very much think this is the most funy and succesful film .
4,Finally a movie with a plot!!!!,"Tom Hanks is an all time favorite for me, and Meg Ryan is never less than entertaining. My brother and I were out of options at the theater, so we ended up with ""Mail"" as our last option. Reluctant, fearing 2 hours of pure ""chick flickage"", we sat and watched and found ourselves really enjoying it. We're also not much for computers and internet, etc, blah-blah, but this one had a whole new insight, without the ""hacker"" presence, being more down-to-earth. More than anything, the movie had a great plot. At first a little slow, but picks up and never stops. Both characters are all new. It's not the same old Hanks or Ryan. You have to see it to believe it."
5,Went to the movies twice for this one....,"A great modern day romantic comedy. Hanks and Ryan do it again! F-O-X will run through your head for a month! If you haven't seen it yet, I promise you'll catch on pretty quick! Loved it and recommend it for everyone!"
3,You've Got Mail,"I find the film You've Got Mail well-made-- and disturbing. Does the two owners' falling in love justify a monopolistic bookstore chain intentionally swallowing a small business that has been a high-quality resource for generations? The film explored this issue up to a point and then subsumed it in the love story. Kathleen Kelly gave up something that had real vitality for her and I was far less convinced that what she was moving into would have as much richness and soul.Love sometimes does seem to swallow and pound one into a new shape, and that's frequently all to the good, but I didn't see that level of passion and depth explored here. It was just cute, and the cuteness allowed an insidious message to slide by."
3,A Fun Romance...,"Certainly not one for promoting morality, but definitely one for commenting on the beginning days of the internet and a budding romance that only found it's beginnings in a chat room. The real romance develops after the principle characters meet in ordinary circumstances and then become almost ""enemies"" in the business world. Loosely based on the premise of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice - the book has a cameo appearance throughout the film - we see a modern day version of Elizabeth who comes to terms and fall in-love with her own Mr Darcey; the richest man in the book industry. It's a cute story!"
5,Always a great Chick Fix,A feel good date movie. I watch it at least a couple times a year. Hanks and Ryan have the magic that make a movie work.
2,Hit the delete button,"Firstly I confess to not being a lover of romantic comedies. That said irrespective of genre, a good film is a good film. This one falls short. It is just an update on the mistaken identity, bumping into each other, I hate you, you hate me guess what happens in the end sort of film that seems to be churned out by the low budget studios. The story is harmless enough. Tom Hanks is a director of a faceless big American bookstore and Meg Ryan owns a small handed down book shop around the corner. They meet often and obviously do not share the same principles. They both have been unlucky in love and both have an e mail correspondent they believe is their ideal partner. And this is my main gripe with the film, there are no sub plots, non surprise elements and for me the biggest crime is a film that isn't worth watching more than once...at most"
2,How many movies like this can you make?,"Gosh! There are already like a million movies with people being deeply inlove without meeting eachother. I don't see how these movies keep getting and I am sick of this theme. There are already like 3 movies just like this and guess what......they even have the same people starring in them! If you haven't already seen ""Joe vs. The Volcanoe"" and/or ""Sleepless in Seattle"", then you might not be as annoyed to see this movie."
3,Although it was cute...been there done that.,"As much as I like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, both in their own rites and together, I found that this movie was a little overkill. Have you seen Sleepless in Seattle? Well instead of the attraction with one another being on the airwaves, it is on the computer.....unless you are having a Tom and Meg movie marathon...I dont recommend this movie."
1,Condition Not as Promised,Book was listed as Very Good in fact it's Fair. Dark pencil marks on front cover and lighter pencil marks on back cover. Top of cover torn. Top of back pages crumpled. Excessive amount of library stamps. Pencil underlining in book. Back of spine broken thus pages ready to fall out. Total misrepresentation of book condition.
5,Mackenzie's Mission,"The story of Joe ""Breed"" Mackenzie is wonderful. I fell in love with him as a young man in Mackenzie's Mountain and love what Linda Howard did with him as a grown man. A must read for any romance reader but, be sure to read Mackenzie's Mountain first."
2,"I liked Joe better in ""Mountain""","Give me the determined 16 year-old from Wolf's story, rather than the domineering 35 year-old here. This older Joe really didn't live up to his potential from the first book. Yes, he has achieved his dreams but he is harder and more pushy in this book. Rather than seducing Caroline into a relationship he basically just informs her that he will have her - no romance at all. He calls her ""my woman"" more than he does by her name, and their sex scenes are all lust, no tenderness. Yes, the sex is hot, but when Joe tells Caroline ""you'll lose your cherry"" I actually cringed. Is he a grown man or a frat boy? He doesn't hesitate to suspect Caroline of a crime and then just gives her a light apology afterwards. I guess we are expected to chalk it all up to a stereotypical fighter jock mentality, but I was hoping he'd turn out more like his dad, whom I adore. Probably not fair of me, but there it is."
2,Overpriced for quality,"Prior to purchase I admit I zoomed in on this item as I was concerned it would look chintzy once delivered. It did not appear so and I was intrigued by the attractive battery operated small globe lighting. I received it today and although it looks mostly as pictured, the quality is very poor and it looks like it was thrown around a bit prior to the manufacturer boxing it. The battery holder's wire is so short that one cannot place it underneath or lodge it in the flowers, so it has to be placed on top or let to dangle on the side of the basket, thus looking very tacky. I probably could have bought the cheap basket and flowers for under $10 at any craft store. I guess I will remove the lighting and make my own arrangement which is pretty expensive for a dozen battery globe lights. Buyer beware."
1,Sounds like listening through a tin can and string!!,"Actually, I take that back; it sounds 1000 times worse than listening through a tin can and string. NO BASS WHATSOEVER. The only thing they have going for them is the look. I have to admit they look pretty sharp, so 1 star for that. Other than that, not worth your money."
5,Season 2! Finaly!,Yes! Finaly! Season 2 is coming! And just 2 days after my birthday! This is perfect! Spongebob totally rocks! I am going to get each season no matter what it takes! And you bet I'm going to see the movie on opening day(November 19)!
2,it depends...,First off i would like to say spongebob squarepants is a great show and that i have nothing against it. However if you have already bought all the other dvds like i have you will only get 2 new episodes. doesnt that suck?
5,spongebob season 2,just in time for the movie and also it will be a year since season one came out and it's about time for season 2. it will be a great dvd set like the 1st one. i hope the include the help wanted episode and the christmas episode in this one. i know the christmas episode is in 2nd season but i wonder how they are working that out with the intro and everyhting being a xmas episode and help wanted wasn't on the 1st season and i hope being part of the show and the pilot episode lets all hope it's on there. if not they might put it on season 3. if not that either they might have to redo the 1st one to put it on there. if not they they thought it was copy right or something i dont know but i like spongebob a lot and i stoppped buying the single dvds aftert just 4 or 5 then i bought season one. now i can enjoy season 2. then 3 next year. unless sooner next year not being close to the end of the year again. only 3 baby and 2 more left then one after this one. yippee. can't wait.
1,Not a fan.,Personally I don't see the appeal of sponge bob. In my opinion it sends the wrong message for our kids. But my 4 yo is already savvy on the kindle so guess I need to apply parental controls early.
5,U of M vs. OSU: The Rivalry,This DVD is fun to watch whether you are a fan of the Wolverines or the Buckeyes.
1,"Good movie, poor quality DVD","I purchased this movie because I had seen it before and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the DVD was of very poor quality - the movie picture was ""grainy"" throughout the film and very noticeable in darker scenes. Also, there was no menu to the movie; instead of going to a menu page to select ""Play Movie"" or ""Select a Scene"", it started right away, which I thought was odd."
4,I love this movie,"Janeane Grofalo is so qute. She is not tall but good looking not only face but mind. I bought ""Ratatoulle"" BD recently because of her. It is good too.I saw Ireland soil first time, and location shooting is wonderful. Especially helicopter shot is great. Must see."
4,Fun Movie,This one of the few movies that came out of Ireland that made me really laugh. This is a movie that you enjoy and not get bored while watching. The Irish caracters are great and not far from the truth on how they really are in those parts of Ireland!
3,Janeane shines,"I usually don't care for romantic comedies (I'm a fan of Janeane Garofalo but couldn't stand ""Cats & Dogs""), but this one won me over. The fresh (for American movies, at least) setting in rural Ireland was good, and Ms. Garofalo made the movie work with her smarts and pluck. The plot is formulaic and nothing special, but the stereotypes of the crusty old Irish people were fun to watch, and the up-and-down romance between the leads was enough to pull the movie forward. I can't in good conscience give this modest feel-good flick more than three stars, but the movie did give me the warm fuzzies at times. Trust me, three stars for a romantic comedy is high praise from me."
2,"Great movie, bad DVD","I like this movie, call me sappy if you will, but the DVD is not worth it, the quality is as bad if not worse than my old VHS tape. The image is grainy and colors are distorted and there are no special features worth having."
5,The Matchmaker,"An excellent comedy - love story for all the family , typically Irish , love the songs and it is just so easy to watch over & over again. A good clean fun filled flick without all the usual outlandish swearing and violence. Well done to all , a big 5 Star from Oz We would all love to vist an Irish town like the one in the movie. Not available in DVD in Australia as far as I know but as soon as it is we will ad it to our library.Tony"
2,Can I Trust This Book?,"I checked this book out from the library.Authors Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux have impressive resumes as poets and educators, BUT I'm not impressed with their fact checking.I found a rather big factual error this book:1. They attributed, ""It was the best of times. It was the worst of times..."" to Dickens' ""Great Expectations."" But it's from ""A Tale of Two Cities."" (page 136)Granted, this blunder isn't about poetry, yet Dickens IS buried in Poet's Corner!Well written, inspirational, yes, so I gave it two stars. But I'm not sure if I will buy it."
1,poet's companion,Some parts of the book were helpful but on the whole I should have saved my purchase price and gone to the Public Library for help.
2,Not All that Special,"If you've read the book or books, and saw this movie, you know this is mocking the brilliance of Tom Clancy. This choppy, made-for-TV film has terrible dialogue, ludicrous conversations, and an awful storyline that barely goes with the book.You probably know screenplay is almost everything, and a poor one makes a film terrible, especially if the screenwriter isn't good in the genre of films he's writing. That was Lionel Chetwynd, who wrote the teleplay. He had previously written countless documentries, and Net Force was his first theatrical film.On a strong point, the acting is fantastic. Scott Bakula has a great performance as Alex Michaels, Kris Kristofferson delivers once again, and Brian Dennehy makes a good effort. Little known actor Paul Hewitt is wonderful playing the young computer wiz, Jay Gridley.Bottom Line: The acting is good, but screenplays kill and this one doesn't deliver. Net Force wouldn't be my first choice for viewing pleasure."
4,A Powerul Reminder of the Power of The Internet,"This film touches on a topic that most of us, who are so deeply saturated with computers and the Internet,completely ignore. We see in this movie a group of Internet hackers led by a Bill Gates clone (played by an amusing Judge Reinhold) and his charming computer wiz (a talented Anjul Nigam) and muscle man (the menacing Xander Berkley)take the controls of the Internet by breaking into the White House. Scott Bakula is the head of the FBI's NetForce division that investigates these computer crimes. This film is a must see for anyone who has been affected by the computer age: Everyone!"
3,Decent book. Rather expensive.,"(Dollar amount) is a lot of money to pay for a long short-story. This should really have been a good short story rather than an ok novella.After some advance press, I was expected the 2nd coming of Patricia Highsmith, but it's not all that.Plus, it's easy to guess the ending."
4,silent cool movie,"very cool movie for it's day and it still holds up today! great space movie about things to come. even better if your a ""green tree huggger""!"
1,Dust Off Your Bong For This One!,"Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs!"
1,Boring!,"Boring...Boy did I have high hopes for this flick. I don't have much time, and after I watched this flick I wanted it all back. I was strongly tempted to toss the disk out of my room and try and hit one of the cement walls to see if it would blow up like the movie did, lol. Don't spend your hard earned cash on this one, get something better like Westworld, 2001, or the original Andromina Strain. later!"
3,Recommend for the true hard core sci fi fans,"It was of those movies I remember from my childhood. I bought it for what I remembered and to share it with my kids. I recommend it for the true hard core sci fi fans. Those who like films with ecology messages. It is not a ray gun, ships blowing up film. No strange worlds or aliens. Just humans and three robots. Many would find it boring today. The effects are great.The acting is B rated. Story could have used a little more development. The characters were a bit one dimensional. I would have like to seen more development between the characters. As it was you understood the main characters reasons, but it was hard to feel for him.The robots were very unique in design. The forest domes appear too small, to limited by what should have been there. By today's standards, the technology and ship look dated. But then when it was made it was quite forward thinking.I would say a great rental movie. Unless you like to collect old sci fi movies."
2,reading blues,"I have read and enjoyed many of Debbie Macomber's books, but this was my least favorite. The plot seemed boring and repetitive. The two lead characters, Carol and Steve, had no redeeming qualities at all. I also felt that this would never happen in real life. Sometimes I feel as though Macomber makes her male characters sound like women. I recommend Debbie Macomber, but not this particular story."
2,Monotonous But Good Read,"Like the prior reviewer, I believe this book became a bit monotonous. After reading for a while I felt that 30 pages later I was at the same point. I didn't find Steve or Carol to be likeable characters, in fact, they're really cruel to each other. The book didn't really make the case for why Steve and Carol loved each other. Neither Carol or Steve were well drawn characters at all. Despite all I have said about this book, I consider it a fairly good read, however. Reading this book encouraged me to consider the other books in Macomber's Navy series."
5,Very Good CD,"in Regard to Breaking up is hard to do, by jivin gene. this CD has a few versions of Breaking up is Hard to do, on it. indeed I have found, that the original 45 hit version is indeed on this CD. Previously I mistakenly thought it was not. My mistake, the mentioned version of the song is on this CD. with that said, I highly recomend this CD, I hope for those wanting it, that it is still availible."
2,Not Very Good,"I read this book because it is a well-know 19th century adventure and another reviewer claimed it was better than Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island."" But ""Trader Horn"" is far inferior to Stevenson's work. The characters are wooden and uninteresting. The writing is competent but not exciting. As an adventure story, this book deserves a grade of C or C-."
3,About this book,"With three Mach 3 fighters mysteriously down (metal failure? a new enemy weapon? sabotage?) and the Air Force pressing for an explanation, metals engineer Paul Sarko, who clad the Cobra, swallows his distaste for further war work and starts investigating. . . dimly, until light appears in the form of a laser which could, under flight conditions, weaken the metal sufficiently to cause it to shatter. The traitor who tipped off the (Russian) enemy tips his hand, clears chief suspect Rita Moreno of malintent in her attentions to Sarko. In a flying finale, he and pilot Colt score one for deterrence over merciless killing. It's about the only action; the rest is stiffly, tritely talked out. Some interest in the quasi-scientific sleuthing, none in the plaster cast."
3,Highly technical,"This is a very comprehensive text. However, make no bones about it; the prose reflects a highly technical style of writing. If you have limited knowledge about differential equations, logic, and statistics, you will struggle to stay engrossed past the first few chapters. Hard reading is an understatment. I was hoping that this would be the book that could boil down what real options are and give me a straightforward approach to their applications. Reading this I feel like I am back in an astrophysics class at MIT."
1,Waste of Money,We use this item for our twin five month old boys. This stroller is a waste of money. We have many problems with this stroller something you would expect from a cheaper stroller not one for this amount of money.These are the problems we have had:The wheels are worn outThe cup holder fell offThe seats that the babies sit in caves inThe clip in the back feel off which causes my 12 pound baby to gradually fall backThe basket under the seat is useless it does not hold even a small diaper bagWhen you contact the company they take pieces to rebuild the stroller and you have to go without a stroller for two weeks.
3,Not a bad ending,"This is the final book to Nora Robert's Key series. Having read the first one (Key of Light), I was really interested in these characters. The second one was'nt bad, but it was'nt as good as I had hoped. It's always hard to keep a reader's attention for three books and Nora did a pretty good job of it, but it was'nt quite right. Not to say this book didn't have it's good moments it did, but it wasn't as exciting as I had hoped and it seemed really long."
4,"A spellbinding read!,","This is my absolute favourite story of this trilogy.Zoe, a single mother and hairstylist, meets Bradley Vane IV, the sexy heir to a home improvement empire. He falls instantly for her. Only she wants nothing to do with him, as their life and finances are worlds apart. And besides a rich boy left her pregnant as a teen, which makes everything far more difficult for Brad.But Brad, loved the man for his single-minded persuit of her, will not take no for an answer.A thrilling read, finding how Zoe learns to overcome her distrust of men and learn to love again while looking for the key."
4,"""Hauntingly Captivating""","Steel woos the reader with the beautiful French chateau, Chateau de Marmouton and the beautiful family that makes it a warm home. After Marie-Ange becomes an orphan, her pleasant days at the chateau become tortured moments at her great aunts farm in Iowa.Torn between a fairytale love and puppy love, Marie-Ange takes a leap of hope, against the advice of those closest to her. However, such a decision could cost her her life.If you are ever mesmerized by a fairytale love, don't neglect to inquire about any skeletons in the closet. You'll have to read the book to get that one."
2,How did I read the entire book?,"Leap of Faith is the first DS book that I have read. For her to be such a popular author I thought the book was crap.I didn't get to involved with the characters because of the lack of description. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone.I don't think I will be reading another DS book. Geez, what a waste of time."
4,A Leap of Faith,"Danielle Steel writes another interesting novel about a young girl named Marie-Ange who grew up in a beautiful Chateau in France. She is wealthy and well loved, but when tragedy strikes her family, she is orphaned and is forced to go to America to be raised by a stingy old great aunt. She is treated poorly and receives little love in her new life. She finds friendship and hope from a local boy named Billy. The two become close, but one day Marie-Ange leaves Billy to go back to France. She is desperate to return to her beloved Chateau de Marmouton. While there she meets a new man named Comte Bernard de Beauchamp. The two fall in love, yet many struggles are ahead. Billy warns her that her life is too good to be true... and maybe it is!"
1,A Leap Of Faith,"This is definately not one of Danielle Steel's better books. I found it ""sappy"".Most of the the characters were unbelieveable. the book was a dissapointment for I am an avid reader of Miss Steel's."
2,"Disappointment, again...","I really do believe that DS is a good author, but I think she is not taking the time to really develop her stories, and lately, the main characters have been very gullible, and they let the one they ""love"" walk all over them, while they let the good guy go, every time. I didn't care for for the way the book ended...it left me hanging. She didn't tell you how things worked out for Marie-Angee and Billy, and it never did give closure to why the aunt was as mean as she was to her niece. There were so many opportunities to redeem herself, and she didn't come through. I enjoyed reading it simply because DS wrote it, but I would try to borrow it from someone, or get it from the library! All in all, a disappointment"
5,Exciting and Well-Written,"This book is almost an encyclopedia of weather phenomena and related stories. In about 340 pages of text, the author recounts over 500 weather-related stories, all categorized by the type of weather phenomenon involved, e.g., tornadoes, hail, rain, snow, etc. The author's writing style is very friendly and engaging; the reader can tell that he has a passion for his subject matter. In most cases, some possible scientific explanations are given for the odd events; in other cases, no explanations are given other than, perhaps, a tongue-in-cheek comment alluding to the veracity of the story. The author's sources are given as is a discussion on some weather archivists - both past and present. This is a very entertaining book and a very easy and enjoyable read. Since most people are interested in the weather, this book should be very popular with just about everyone."
2,awful juicer,"i tried to the bests of my ability to use this. no way that can work.if you plug it in and squeeze, no juice at all came out.then you read the packaging's 2 lines instruction and before squeezing, remove the device to clear the middle of the lemon tube you just carved and insert the device back... now, just a few drops (MUCH less than squeezing a lemon half by hand) and most of it leaks between the fruit and the reinserted device, not the funnel opening.Just cut your lemons in half and squeeze. you will need less effort, get more juice, spill less, and not have something to clean up+1 start because the company provided me the most trouble free return i've ever experienced at amazon."
4,A good chunk of devo for a good price,"This album is great, wether you're a DEVO newbie or a seasoned veteran. I would recommend this album even if you have no earthly idea who DEVO is. The best songs I would say are ""Secret Agent Man"",""Pity You"", and ""The Day My Baby Gave Me A Surprise.""All in all, a solid album for many to enjoy."
5,Still Sounds Unique,"Even after so many years, it's obvious how unique and ahead of their time Devo were. ""The Day My Baby Gave Me A Surprize"" and ""Beautiful World"" are two of the greatest songs written in their time. Forget the geek images, these guys had an axe to grind, and they used that edge! If you're even remotely into Devo, make sure you buy the collection of Devo videos called ""We're All Devo."" It proves that these guys were artists in every sense of the word."
2,"Yet another weak ""Pulp Fiction"" rip-off.","I was hoping this movie would bring somthing new to the world of cinema. But all ""Go"" brought me was regret for renting it. All I see in this movie is ""Pulp Fiction"" with teens wrather than adults as the main characters. And just like ""Pulp Fiction"" this movie does not go in order from beginning to end. And the first scene is set in a diner with a girl and a boy talking, the scene later appears in the movie all over again, identical to.... yes you got it ""Pulp Fiction"". Other Pulp rip-offs include an outside drug-dealer , a character on extremely to many drugs, and corrupt cops. So if you want to get the real deal, than get ""Pulp Fiction""."
3,One Word.... Simon!,Which for me was what made the movie so enjoyable. Although not as interesting overall as the segment with Ronna trying to get rent money the Las Vegas trip was too reminiscent of my more youthful days and similar excursions. Simon is absolutely hysterical whether going to a strip club or hookin' up with two girls. And for a stupid guy like myself the chase scenes were very exciting. You don't always need character driven material in order to be effective and Simon's crew is. Their segment was just flat out funny and an adrenaline rush. It was too easy to see myself and some of my real life buddies in the role of Simon and his crew.The dinner party scene was unusual to say the least but to me not all that effective and it really didn't lend itself to the cohesiveness of the film.Not a purchase but well worth viewing.
3,"Hilarious and inventive 2/3 of the way through, then...","I loved this movie from the get go with it's kenetic visual style and wry acting. However, the third act involving Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr just about completely fell flat and ruined a movie that had me giving it 4 stars. However, I do recommend this film for anyone that was a fan of Pulp Fiction or black comedies."
2,Why am I only the one who's sick of Pulp Fiction wannabes?,"Note to director: You're not Tarantino. You've got a great visual flair, but this script is the most derivative piece of writing i've ever witnessed. This is Pulp Fiction light from the get-go. Swingers was ten times more original than this. Decent performances all alround, but overall: you can afford to pass Go"
5,Go see it,"The has to be one of the most original films of the year. The acting is brilliant which each charachter containing so much depth and style.It is a pulp fiction style movie in which the lives of young american delinguents are traced back to one outrageous night. Each charachter gets mixed up in different kind of troubles including drugs, shootings ,robbery and murder. Then they are all linked together in the story. The same director also made ""swingers"", another classic movie and if you liked that you will be blown away by this. The extra features included are the best i have ever seen. There are 14 deleted scened including different endings and mistakes that were made by the actors. Also included are three music videos including steal my sunshine by Len. There are behind the scenes feacturette and commentery by the director. The main menu is also very slick. Buy this now for god sake. A true clssic"
2,a not so great movie,"This movie was pretty bad. The only thing that this movie had going for it was the inventive way of how they told each person's story. Though I might try and give this movie a second chance, by seeing it again. I don't recommend this movie. There are a lot of other movies that are more rent worthy, but if you have nothing better see then go for it."
3,Some good young actors in a self-consciously cool movie,"Every ingredient in this movie seems thrown in to make you say, ""Wow...cool..."". But, ultimately, I became so aware of the ""coolness"", that the movie ended up being a disappointment. There's some really good acting in the film and some genuinely fresh ideas but, ultimately, it didn't come off nearly as ""cool"" as it thinks it is."
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie. I have heard comparisons to Pulp Fiction, but I honestly think they are nowhere near similar to each other. Maybe the fact that they are a bit split up into stories, but not even that really seems the same. The movie has a great storyline filled with moments that leave you wondering what's going to happen next."
3,OK,"Dodgy repeat cover. Solid first side. Women is one of my favourites, but Reed's alleged handiness with his fists make it potentially queesy, though. Second side weaker. Reed tends to recycle songs endlessly and Satellite of love turns up as Heavenly Arms with a ghastly and embarrassing chorus. JFK song is naff. What was the Heroine all about? Fun but obscure. Maybe even preposterous."
2,What are you talking about?,"I am continually baffled by the amount of praise showered on this album. Of course, being a big fan of Lou Reed's work before (VU and his 70s solo work) and after (New York, Songs for Drella, Magic and Loss), I thought I couldn't miss with this album that so many people had called a masterpiece. How wrong I was. With the exception of the title track, there are no excellent songs here, and many are just plain embarassing. Women is a piece of dopey patronizing schmaltz while The Day John Kennedy Died is a ridiculous stab at optimistic insight that falls quite a few feet short of the mark. I just don't understand how people can consider these lyrics to be among his best. Lou Reed was masterful at depicting seemy underbellies and such, but he just is at a loss for decent words when he's happy. And his divorce from his then-wife shortly after this album should let you know just how sincere he was in all his loving tributes. Don't buy the hype."
3,good tunes....,"i got the songs as they were sung, not as they shown in the moviewas hoping for wild mike, all I got was 'Wild n Free'"
4,My son loves this!!!,"My son loves this CD. His only complaint is that the ""You Gotta Moo"" song wasn't on there. Actually, listening to it with him, some of those songs are hilarious."
4,"Cheap, apparently solid.","This product had everything that I expected, and has so far worked perfectly. It was a part-to-part replacement for by bent wheel, so I was expecting nothing less.No frills, but does the job for a good price."
1,Poopy,WE were misinformed and had to sell it on Craigslist because it costs more to ship it back than the original cost
3,Would not recomend,"This tool set it okay for simple around the house jobs, however it has way too many bolts and wrenches. I would recommend buying a multi-head screw driver, hammer, and some pliers and skip the rest of the junk."
1,I wish the game would work!,"I purchased the PC Blacksite Area 51 game used. It loaded fine, but gets stuck each time it begins to run. When I get a new computer, I will try to play it again. The low rating is for not working."
3,Freud & Buddha? Not exactly.,"This books contains good information on Buddhism. However, it appears that the author took too much liberty in comparing Buddhism to Psychoanalysis (possibly due to his over-enthusiasm). In the first 4 chapters I found myself being led to believe that if Siddhartha had been around when Freud was alive they would agree on many things, and it seemed that the author thought Freud and other psychoanalysts were practicing Buddhism. For example, the author would offer a paragraph about what Siddhartha believed and then quoted Freud. Very confusing and so untrue. Psychoanalysis and Buddhism are not the same. Readers may want to read Armstrong'sBuddha; Kornfield'sThe Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist PsychologyorTeachings of the Buddhato get a better synopsis of Buddhism."
3,good 'nough,"a bunch of underlining should, perhaps, have brought the rating down from good to fair, Otherwise timely and ""good 'nough""."
