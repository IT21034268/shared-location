4,A little too clinical...,"An excellent book on Zen Buddhism and the healing properties of meditation as it relates to Psychotherapy. I read this book after finishing the author's second book Going to Pieces without falling apart. I found that a little easier to stay with. This first book, while enormously informative, does become clinical at times. You get the sense he was writing it for his colleagues so they could bring the healing message of meditation into the mainstream. I suggest the second book first and then read this if you feel you need more answers. The subject is dense and wide. It requires just as much attention as you are willing to give it."
2,Sound quality not great,"As happens sometimes with BGO releases, the sound quality isn't great on this set. It sounds flat when compared to the original Capricorn CD pressings from the late 90s. Fortunately, the Capricorn ones can still be found at a decent price on Amazon, at least for now. Bought this BGO pressing with thoughts of saving money. Ended up getting rid of it and buying the Capricorn ones instead. Should have done that to start with."
4,Weekend Warriors,"A fast moving page turner. I've already ordered the next book in the series.It also does a short review so if there is a lapse between reading the first and then subsequentbooks, you're reminded of who the characters are. I do not think you have to read in sequence."
2,Too beginnerish,"I usually love Fern Michaels' books but, after reading Weekend Warriors, I will not be reading this series. I felt the writing sounded like it was a novelist's very first book, not one far into her career. I'm very disappointed as I can usually block out my life for a day while I delve into a Fern MIchaels book; this one I couldn't even read to the end of. While I agree that the premise is good and the idea of strong women getting their revenge is appealing, I can't get into this book. I will be looking forward to Ms. Michaels' next book but not another from this series."
1,Sounded like a must read,"Turned out totally different from what I expected. This was too hardcore, looking for a kinder, gentler way to exact revenge, don't look for this book to deliver it. Could have been a great read but the methods and degrees used were too over the top to be credible."
5,Sisterhood Series - Weekend Warriors,"Excellent Book Series! I can't seem to get enough of them, I start on a new one as soon as I finish one! (Still reading them...)"
3,Definately in the Beginning Stages,"Matt Skiba's side project, Heavens, is good. However, for what I know Skiba is capable of, and listening to the songs, it could have been SO much better. I by no means expected another Alkaline Trio, however Heavens has so much potential to be so much more than it is. I can only hope that with time, Heavens will grow into a mature and quality sound that can proudly stand alongside Alkaline Trio.The soft, almost harrowing sounds are something that I expected more from Dan Andriano. It's great to see Matt Skiba exploring a side of himself that he doesn't in Trio. I just think that as first albums go, Heavens is still crawling. They're not quite ready to walk yet."
5,impressive,"The Crimson Fairy book is just another superb fairy tale book edited by Andrew Lang. Unlike most of the Fairy books edited by Lang this one has color illustrations as well as black and white. This book contains 45 black and white, and 8 color illustrations. Along with the illustrations are the stories, ranging in length from a couple pages to almost twenty. There are 36 stories including: The Story of the Seven Simons, The Boy Who Could Keep a Secret, Tiidu the Piper,Paperarello, The Cottager and his Cat, Eisenkopf, The Three Robes, Shepherd Paul, The Magic Kettle, and more."
5,We must know where we have been.,How can we know where we are headed if we have little knowledge of our past. This is a wonderful way to become friends with those brave people who created this great country. They were so unselfish. We should be ashamed of how greedy we have become. The governement wasn't founded to care for you; only to protect you from dangerous outside forces.
1,rise to rebellion,"I ordered and paid for a hardcover book and recieved a paperback with a hardcover. I read hardcover for a reason. Larger book, larger type, etc. I feel I have been ""taken"" by amazon and am very pissed. I will be more careful in the future."
5,Every American should read this book because...,"a) You will come away with a much better understanding of our country, it's founding fathers and what they went through before they became ""rebels"".b) It will make you more proud to be an American than you already are...it's truly inspiring.c) Jeff makes history SO much fun.d) It's a wonderful story, by an EXCELLENT author."
3,"Worth the time, but...","This is an OK read for the scholarly among us...This will not excite you like Ken Agori's novel Defenders of the Holy Grail, which explains how the Crusades truly happened. Shaara does hishomework, like Agori, but his reach is too pedestrian"
5,Extremely Insightful,"My second year history teacher in college used this book as our text book. Reading this book was like looking at history form the street level, enabling one to understand why they did what they did during that time. And it's also very fun read."
3,jewel...well...,"I agree w/ some of you a/b her voice...she does try to hard. But, the fact that she does try hard makes her better that she used to be. You ppl do need to stop judging her so much, for i.e., her teeth. She can't help that she didn't have very much money...she went thru a lot. Now as for her muic...some of it is ok...Foolish Games is my favorite song by her but i wish that the song on the CD was the same as they play on the radio. It sounds much better & shows her abilty of music & poetry better."
1,What was I thinking?!,"I bought this CD when it first came out, thinking all her songs would be as good as the ones they play on the radio. Boy, was I wrong! Most of the songs deal with drugs, sex, and violence. I think that is OK for 1 or 2 songs, but not a whole freaken' album! If you want the GOOD songs, bye the CD singles. They are less expensive and you get just the songs you want."
1,You have got to be kidding,This is probably the worst CD that I have ever had the misfortune of buying. Granted she has three/four good songs but the rest suck! She is an idiot and her music follows suit (listen to Adrian and you will understand how dumb Jewel really is) Wow was I disappointed. ALL of her songs sound exactly the same. Alanis Morissett blows her away.
3,"Decent, quiet start to an over-blown career","This is a good folk/pop album; nothing wrong with it. It should have come and gone with Jewel never being heard from again; fifteen minutes over, end of story. Unfortunately it launched one of the most over-blown music careers ever. That's what's wrong with the music biz today; one hit gets you over-exposure for the rest of your career whether you deserve it or not (see also - Alanis Morissette, John Mayer, Britney Spears, etc...the list goes on and on). Maybe it's the media, not the music biz, that's to blame. Whatever. I just hope that the next ""artist"" Time magazine decides to put on it's cover has the talent to carry that high honor. Jewel, unfortunately for our ears, didn't/does not."
1,Pretty Vacant.,"I have to admit, I like looking at Jewel. I mean, what's not to like? She's hot...and I just adore that crooked nose and that screwy smile. And her hips. Child-bearing. Very enticing. VERY! Oh, yeah, I like Jewel. Alot. Now, if she'd only stop trying to write, that'd be nice. Because she can't write for her life. The title track on this album, 'Pieces of You,' is delivered as if she's Mother Theresa in heat. Sexy voice, but sanctimonious, self-righteous, politically-correct, insipid to the max. So bad, quite frankly, had I not known it was meant seriously, I might have thought it was a Saturday Nite Live skit. If you're looking for great female singer/songwriters of today, try Hope Sandoval (see also, Mazzy Star), Fiona Apple, Sheryl Crow, Stacey Earle, or Julie Miller. To be fair, however, Jewel does have a great voice. Too bad she has nothing of consequence to say."
1,Wishing,"I alway's had a problem with this CD, some songs released on this cd are different versions than the song's played on the radio ( the radio versions are better)."
1,Christmas Album Fantastic,"Jewel's Christmas Album, JOY, is a joy to listen to. Her beautiful voice catches your attention through the entire CD. On the other hand, this album was not at all a pleasure to listen to. All she does is tell weird stories in song. All the songs sound the same. Jewel, do more albums like your Christmas album. It is a jewel!"
3,Mixed Feelings Here,"Some of the songs here have great lyrics with a lot of depth and emotion, but others sound like she was trying way too hard to put emotion into her voice. I was also disappointed that ""Foolish Games"" on this is a bad live version instead of the way better radio version. ""You were meant for me isn't the right version either. This CD basically reminds me of a high schooler trying hard to sound grown up and worldly."
5,A JEWEL IN THE ROUGH,THIS IS GREAT! I have never in my life heard a better album. With songs like WHO WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL and FOOLISH GAMES which are sure to be classics this album can not dissapoint. This girl has gone far and i hope she doesnt stop. The best lyrics i have ever heard. FANTASTIC!!!
2,Jewel is ... hard to take,"If I were going to slit my wrists, sit in the bathtub, and feel sorry for myself for a while, this is the album I would put on. Get over yourself, babe. You can sing, but you're as yet to write a song that doesn't make all those vocal histrionics embarassingly empty."
2,Nice try,"People, please stop reviewing albums in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE YELLING AND UNDERMINES YOUR CREDIBILITY BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE A HYSTERICAL TEENAGER. Now, as for Jewel, she has an odd voice that wavers between opera, little girl, and kermit the frog. Her lyrics are mostly depressing, and her attempts to paint herself as an outsider in the press are contradicted by this thoroughly-in-the-nineties-zeitgeist recording."
3,A talented singer singing some good and some bad.,"This album contains a wide range of types. It is easy listening unless you listen to the words which are all about violence, drugs, and sex. Some of the songs are just plain boring."
5,Jewel Soars,"This is a wonderful album that I highly recomend. Jewel's soulful voice combines with her poetic lyrics and what you get is a great Cd. There are songs so beautiful on here that they make me cry. This is one of the few Cds I can play without skipping a single track. My favorite songs on here are Painters, Daddy, Who Will Save Your Soal and Adrian. The rest of the songs are just as great. If you buy this Cd you will not regret it."
5,Heavenly Voice,"Jewel has the type of voice that can raise your spirits no matter what mood you are in. The songs can have the most depressing lyrics, about social ills, premature babies, hate crimes, or the most romantic lyrics, like You Were Meant For Me, and the result is the same: You feel delighted for listening to her beautiful voice and superb acoustic guitar skills. There are several songs in this collection that were recorded from a live concert before she signed a record deal, and I use the word concert hesitantly. It was more like a cafe in front of 50 people. She is the real deal, living in a van and playing in front of a handful of people until discovered by a major label."
2,I want to like it...,"I just can't. Jewel really tries with this album. Her potential is clearly there. The problem is that these aren't songs - they're poems. As such, they just don't work set to music. The themes themselves are, at least in a few cases, interesting and important. I'm just not sure that Jewel has anything new to say about them. And while the guitar playing isn't bad, it does seem repetitive after a while. All the songs sound the same (save for Meant for Me and Foolish Games).Little Sister, Daddy and Pieces of You are really underappreciated songs, probably because the themes are controversial. That said, they aren't so well done to warrant buying the album. Of course, Meant for Me and Foolish Games are wonderful. The rest is iminently forgetable. The good stuff from here will be on a greatest hits CD, or can be acquired through a CD single, or a compilation CD. Get Spirit instead, or listen to other folkie types like Tracy Chapman, Tori Amos, or Ani DiFranco."
1,. . . z z z z z z z z z z z,"Listen up Jewel fans. If you want to hear a female singer who is full of poetry, maturity, and relevance, check out Joni Mitchell. She's been the queen of folk for 30 years for a very good reason - she has TALENT."
1,Good voice bad music,"Although Jewel has a very lovely voice her CD is summed up in the title above. I got her CD after I heard her music on the radio but when I listened to it the songs weren't even the same versions that I'd heard before. And as for the rest of the songs, they all sounded the same and the horrific lyrics made me instantly hit the stop button. Especially the song ""Daddy"". After listening to that one I felt like saying ""Shame on you, Jewel! Shame! Shame!"" I don't listen to it at all now, and if you don't like lyrics that make you want to put your hands over your ears then don't waste your money on this."
2,Not what you heard on the radio,"I should had come here for the reviews before buying the CD. I liked what is played on the radio, that raspy, halting manner of hers is what sets her apart and what hooked me. In this CD, I agree with other reviewer, she's just a 90s version of Tiffany and the arrangement here isn't catchy for this pop guy."
5,Classic!,"I purchased this album as a teenager back in 1995. One of the many appeals, for me, of Jewel's music comes from the rawness in her lyrics. I can remember being emotionally jolted by her honesty, the passion with which she sang her lyrics, and the beautiful melodies in her songs.Seventeen years later I can still play this album and listen to it as if it's the first time I have ever heard it. The lyrics still speak to me. I consider it a true folk music classic."
5,simply the best,"wow, this is the purest & sincere album i have ever come across. she is talented! she should earn a Grammy for her work!"
2,An Inauspicious Beginning,"I orinally bought Spirit after hearing of Jewel and listening to ""Hands"" while Michelle Kwan was skating to it. I was impressed enough to seek out other material by Jewel. In her debut album, she shows her immaturity as she comes across as an angst-ridden teenager (which she may well have been when she wrote many of the songs). She may relate well to you if you are also an angst-ridden teenager, but this is unlikely to play well with an older audience. At least based on this album, I would not compare her favorably with such other contemporary sing-songwriters as Beth Nielsen Chapman, Richard Schindell, or Dar Williams."
4,a cool cd,"this is a cool cd. There are good songs like who will save your soul,foolish games,you were meant for me. I enjoyed the cd. Im glad i bought and you will to if you buy it."
4,Pocket-sized positive,"In Attitude 101, Maxwell outlines his key thoughts on the importance of a positive attitude from his earlier (and larger) books. This is a good gift item for anyone you believe is ready to take their life and impact to a higher level, from adults to high school students. It would be a good graduate's gift.The whole book is a quick read, almost outline in format and delivery, full of Maxwell's trademark memorable and applicational illustrations. Hard core cynics and others with superiority issues may sniff at it, but real people will benefit from it. Superior cynics are never leaders anyway.Buy a few, and give them out. See who comments on something they got from reading it, and begin hanging out with them - if they aren't leaders yet, they're on their way!"
3,Too preachy for my liking.,"While this book did go over some great tips on improving attitude, the advice in the books seems to be common among other books on leadership and the whole Christian overtone didn't suit my personal preferences."
1,Just Awful.,"It is rare to fine an anthology as bad as this. These stories are just terribble. I had to read this for school. If you have to do the same, under any circumstances, DO NOT. Get a friend to tell you what its about. Pay your sibling. Just don't read it!!"
4,Lots of material,"The book is filled with interesting information, but I didn't love the way it was written. I agree that it sometimes seems like a losers history of the US."
3,"A political, not a cultural, history","Professor Zinn definitely fills a need--a well-documented political history of the United States from the point-of-view of those who work to move this country nearer to a realization of the democratic values expressed in The Declaration of Independence--in other words to transform the beautiful rhetoric of the Declaration into political reality. This work has only begun and has a long way to go. Zinn's book does disappoint me, though, in touching so lightly on cultural history: just to pick two examples, the Index lists neither J.J. Audubon nor George Washington Carver. My impression is that Zinn elbows the unique achievements of Americans aside in his anxiety to shine a searchlight on our dirty laundry--of which there is a great heap!"
4,USA for non USA citizens,"The USA, for good and for bad, has nowadays a great influence on the rest of the world. I, therefore, believe it is important to try to understand their ways, which are not the ways of most of the world. Although we all know that ""americans"" (I am also american, having been born in South America) are more interested in things than in people, I found Zinn's book illuminating in this respect and many others. Culture, in its anthropological meaning, is a historical construction, and Zinn manages to unfold this construction from its very beginning. Together with the video ""The american dream"", it's the most illuminating document I have found in this respect. I recommend it to all who wish to understand better the USA and its contradictions."
2,Biased focus a disappointment,"Zinn disappoints with a biased and narrow accounting of the United States' history. Despite the one-sided slant on key events (and much information not presented), this book is worth reading if only for the volume of factual stories and events gleamed over by conventional texts."
1,Fact in search of an author.,"The sad part is the ideas Zinn is so passionate about deserve to be expressed well and read by an even larger audience than he currently enjoys.Had Zinn hooked up with a good writer this may well have been a good book. As it stands I can't help feel I am browsing wily nilly through stacks of index cards filled with quotes, facts, and observations from original and secondary sources pertaining to a particular view of U.S. history.Now all someone has to do is organize all these cards into a book with, if we are lucky, a compelling narrative flow. That is a separate art from the collection of the index cards, something Zinn is very good at.Currently the material is mind numbingly unorganized, repetitive, and verbose, which is a shame. Zinn's view of the primary forces that have shaped, and continue to shape our country deserve a better showing."
1,Communist revisionist history,"Want to justify your anti-American view of history? Do you feel guilty because of the pigment of your skin or how much money your parents make? Do you want to learn history but only if it shows communism/socialism in a good light? Then this book is for you.However, if you are being forced to read this book because of your professor, save yourself some time and money, don't buy it and just write a report about how the world would be a better place without any white people or Christians and I'm sure you'll get an A+."
1,Anti-american communist propoganda,"To put it bluntly, this book is terrible. I was in a situation recently where this was the only book I had to pass the time so I read most of the book (about 2/3). The writer is an admitted marxist socialist and his writing is heavily biased. From page one you will learn three things from this publication:1) White people are evil2) Rich people are evil3) Going on strike is more benificial than workingI do not understand all the entitlement and envy in today's society but I can tell you publications like this one do not help. I have no problem with white people or rich people, they are not my enemy. The title to my review says it all... if you hate this country and want to feel bad about being an American, go ahead and read this book. If not, pass on this waste of time. Thank you."
1,Fails as history,"Splotchy, redundant and subjective critique of the mean white men who oppressed everyone and everything, while creating the most wonderful country ever conceived in human history. The ""narrative"" is without context - a failure when viewed as an historical work."
5,WHY IS THE EBOOK MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PAPERRBACK?,"Why am I paying more for the ebook than the actual book which needs to be printed, bound, shipped?That said, this book should be required reading for everyone."
1,Socialistic Commentary,"This author has written many books that appeal to the Socialist leaning people of our country.Be aware of hi. In his book, 'Soho Marx', he gives his account as to why Karl Marx was so great.Look what Zinn's thinking has done to Argentina since the early 1900's.Stay far from this author."
1,"a.k.a. ""The Losers' History of the United States""","Ok, Howie, OK, I get it: USA bad, everyone else good. But that's waaaaay too simplistic. Though I should not be surprised. Mr. Zinn is one of those people who seem to think that the United States is the only country in the history of civilization to have conquered the natives, oppressed people, etc. Guess what? Other countries have, too! *gasp!* Hard to believe, I know, but crack open 'The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' and be amazed.Also, condemning Columbus, et al. for not having 20th/21st century ""morals"", viewpoints, whatever is a waste of time. The only thing that comes across is a smug superiority of ""If I was there at the time, I would have saved the day!"" Most people in history were doing what they thought was best AT THAT TIME, enlightened or not.Hey, I'll be the first to admit we're not a perfect country (is any country perfect?)... but I'd still rather live here than any place else."
4,great service,The book arrived much earlier then I expected. The condition was exactly what I paid for. The book is an almost frightening history of how this country was started. It really was an eye opener to see that the people were so wealth hungry. We were raised to believe that our country was founded by people looking to better their lives. This book shows another picture of our founders that will never get taught in school. It's really sad. What's worse is we wonder why we are in the shape we are now. History can help us see what mistakes we've made and teach us what not to do.
1,"A Dishonest, Revisionist History","I read this book expecting a fair treatment of history. Instead, I found that the book was a dishonest, highly liberally biased work of propaganda. Knowing that this book is inflicted on young people in our schools angers me, because any professor who chooses this book clearly has an anti-US agenda.This book is a horrible distortion of the facts. If you have a background in history and clearly understand what went on, you may want to read this book just to learn how thoroughly the left is distorting the truth to young, impressionable minds.For those many reviewers of this book who regard this book as a ""new,"" ""fair,"" or ""revealing"" treatment of history, I respectfully advise that they do much more learning independently before accepting this dishonest travesty at face value.American Thinker has published a wonderful article about this book:[...]"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Kid has to deal with devious demons, wenches and wizards.An apprentice that wants to learn the magic thing finds the going a bit on the slow side, as all that other life stuff actually has to happen, as well. Plenty of amusing magical and other demonic hijinks ensure along the way for young Skeeve."
5,Both my kids love this toy!,"I bought this for my boy's third birthday and also picked one up (on clearance) for my 4-year-old daughter. They both play with this toy almost daily (even though my girl is otherwise totally into the whole pink-Barbie-ballerina-fairy thing). They both have created an amazing variety of things with their sets, and they love having their own toolboxes. The only downside is the box itself--they both broke very quickly and I replaced them with sturdier versions (...). This is minor, however, compared to the excellence of the toy itself. We will definitely be adding on to this for a long time to come."
1,Very Basic Meditation,"Supplier was great, but, this book is very basic. Anyone really looking for ways to slow down during the day and meditate for a few minutes should look somewhere else."
4,help me find a copy of this book please,I have read the Moonshae trilogy by douglas niles and thought it was a brilliant trilogy. then read the first 2 books in the druidholme trilogy and found this an even more interesting set of books that I just could not put down once I started reading them. But for about 2 years now I have been trying to get the druid queen but have not had any look getting it anywhere if you can help me can u e-mail me at mage@scottsmail.com
3,Missing parts and pieces,"This item probably is good, except that when it was shipped it was missing pieces and the box that they shipped it in was ripped to shreds by the time it got here... it was left on my front step in a garbage bag... needless to say we returned it for something else..."
2,Disappointing Book,"Book is a well intentioned, rather unfocused, collection of the author's opinions about how to interact with one's children and grandchildren. His musings reflect family experiences living in rural and small town America. As such, the book is unlikely to resonate with a majority of Americans of different ethnicity, religion, and/or socioeconomic group."
1,does NOT WORK,"This Stanley stud sensor did not find the studs in my garage.For any given horizontal scan path at constant slow speed,I would get different results over the same patheach time I used this sensor. In other words, it was worthless."
1,Miss Julie,This was a TOTAL WASTE for me. It took forever for it to download; in fact it NEVER FINISHED DOWNLOADING. Sixty minutes after I purchased the viodeo the little circle was still showing that it was downloading. I gave up in frustration. I WILL NEVER ORDER A VIDEO FROM AMAZON AGAIN !!
4,sweet album. makes me want to move to puerto rico,"This album is great. combining the funky beats with the smooth lyrics make for this to be a good compilation. if you are into modern latin culture, and you don't know where to start, pick this cd up. The only problem i have with this cd, as with most latin music released in the united states, Is that most of the words are in english anyways, leaving out the ""full effect"". I would recomend trying to find baby rasta y gringo music (hard to find on amazon). that is true latin music, but pick this up to hold you over, because the music does sound good."
1,not what I thought it was,"this was not accurately described - this product was only one-sided, and thus not really functional for a tree with any depth. this might be fine for a tree that sits in a corner, but not for other situations."
5,His first and his best. Well deserving of the Pulitzer.,"In ""Advise and Consent"", Allen Drury introduces the reader not only to the inner workings of the United States Senate, but also to the very human realities of our elected officials. His novel is filled with believable characters, dealing with real problems and issues. And he knows the Senate from an insider's perspective.Although the particular issues are now a bit dated (although this was not the case when I first read the book nearly 20 years ago), the realities of government are still the same (if not worse).Once upon a time, many people read this book in high school. It should be required reading in both literature and civics.We lost Mr. Drury a year or so ago at the age of 80. From the perspective of this reader, he will be sorely missed."
4,Intresting book,"I must say that this book is very inspiring with its stories the writer shares with and was disappointed that there wasn't a whole lot of exercises to help strengthen your psychic powers. Howerver there are a few things I do not agree with Jeffery. In his book he writes that that the dead loves us and want us to be be happy but from my own personal experiences with spirits of the dead there are some that do and some don't, and some that enjoy causing us pain.But thats just my oppion."
5,I love it!,"John Leguizamo is a effin laugh riot! I love his style of comedy because it is a mix of comedy and drama. He speaks of his youth and family, growing up and relationships. I first fell in love with his comedy when I was younger and happened to catch Sexaholix on cable. Another classic though it is somewhat hard to find. He really is a comic genius and I would highly recommend this DVD!"
5,Good value,"The Franklin video series features humorous, age-appropriate (3 'til about 6, without being too sacchirin for older siblings and parents) lessons in life and morality. This particular release, which includes 6 episodes, is a great value at the price, when compared to the others which include 2 episodes for 2/3 the cost. We've rented this so often I'm thrilled to find it for purchase."
5,Very cute Franklin Video,Recommended to Franklin fans. Very cute video about little kid topics. Always has a positive message in story line and good moral lesson at the end. Very wholesome stuff.
4,More than just science fiction,"Dragon's Egg is a great read because it is more than just science fiction. Forward makes some powerful statements (sometimes rather amusing) about humanity. During the development of the cheela (the lifeforms on the surface of the neutron star) he frequently pokes fun at humanity. For example, the development of cheela religion is a well done jab at our society.Personally I thought the book spent too much time developing the cheela and not enough time getting the reader familiar with the humans hovering above the star. You don't really learn much about the humans until very late in the book. I guess I was hoping to know more about them, their motives, etc. All in all it was a very worthwhile read."
3,not the best revival,"the original (not movie version) is so much better. they add and get rid of some songs. and personally rosie is not that impressive. we did this at my high school and the house was packed and our rizzo and kenickie rocked! anyway, if you liek broadway, get the original."
1,Doubtful veracity,"Extremely questionable story of a top Soviet spy. I suspect this author is telling stories that he thinks people would want to hear, rather than actual facts. Much of this book strikes me as just plain silly, and highly distorted if true.Zero stars in my opinion."
1,Disappointed,I have had dried fruit that was unsulphered but these nectarines looked black and do not have a good taste at all!
2,"disappointing - characters unreal, style artificial","An unsuccessful attempt to imitate Jane Austen's style, the book is filled with unlikely people behaving in the most extraordinary and clumsily-contrived ways. Examples which jarred particularly were the use of ""serviette"" and the way the hero, a peer, seemed not to know that he could ""frank"" letters and thus save the recipient the cost of postage."
3,"not great fiction, but good, light-hearted reading","I purchased this book with a little trepidation after reading some of the reviews. I read it straight after reading a very well-crafted work of non-fiction, so initially the style of writing irritated me slightly, and I had to try to ignore the odd thought such as, ""Jane would not have said/written that""...That said, once you put out of your mind the Austen connection, and just enjoy it as a light, historical mystery, it stacks up pretty well. I enjoyed the book enough to now buy and read the others in the series."
2,"Sloppy and Overly Politicized ""Economics""","-""It's The Economy, Stupid,"" was James Carville's slogan during the Clinton political campaign. It's a fitting title, because this is a political book, not one about economics.Paul Begala is an intelligent political operative of the Democrat party who gets in many partisan zingers. As far as true economic analysis, the book is glaringly lacking. The actions of millions of individuals comprise the economy, and determine the direction the economy will go. The president has very little to do with this. Therefore, equating the president with a corporate CEO is intentionally misleading. It may however, be a good political strategy, ... until the economy rebounds significantly. If you want to learn and understand economics, this is not the book for you. If you want to debate economic issues without spending the time to understand economics, this is the one for you."
4,well written support of things past,"this book, though perhaps hard to understand and get into, is more than worth the read. the reader looking for another Clockwork Orange may be dissappointed, but there is still something fantastic about this book."
1,This is the least funny CD I have ever bought - and I'm a Norm MacDonald fan,"He should have done a standup CD, these skits are mostly unfunny and tedious. There are a couple of mildy amusing skits but even the best are subpar compared to 99% of comedy CD's out today. It's too bad, I love Norm's standup material. This disc is a complete rip off and not worth purchasing. Buy Bill Maher or Lewis Black instead."
4,a really good read,"I had read some of Ozick's essays a while back, but just recently found this novel of hers. I was interested in the character who is a take on Christopher Robin, but soon found myself caring very much for these other refugees in the book. There are some slow parts, esp when the author is trying to explain an ancient Jewish cult which is the obsession of one of the characters. But its an excellent character study. In fact, while there is a plot of sorts, its really the development of the characters and the resolution to their problems that are the heart of the story. I'll be reading more of her books for sure."
4,"A Fun, Fluffy Indulgence","I'll admit that I have a thing for Sean Patrick Flannery, but he is only one reason I love this movie. This is like a paperback romance bundled up into a lowbudget TV movie. LOVED IT!"
1,Breaks Very Easily,"It's very poor quality, and breaks easily. I was rolling dough on it with a rolling pin and it broke. Save your money."
5,2 pharmacist recommendation,"My wife and I are both pharmacists, and we recommend this item. Normally used at home for cooking uses. Meaty, weighty, and it will get the grindin' done right. Outside of mortar is smooth, but inside is coarse- and that's how you want it. Pestle is same way- the working ends are coarse so grinding is a snap."
4,Breakout album,"This was Less than jake's breakout album in '97 when Ska took over the world for like 6 months. very cool if you like ska bands like reel big fish , buck-0-nine, aquabats, dance hall crashers."
3,IT'S OK,"This CD is all right. It's worth the money, and I can listen to it from beginning to end, but that's only because it's a little over 30 minutes long. This band used to be my favorite, but Puddle of Mudd has taken that spot."
4,a fast paced hyper rock non-stop skankin' party,"the songs are so full of energy and meyham that it's hard to stop listening. the greatest band to hail from Gainesville, FL, LTJ create a perfect blend of hard punk and ska. If you get a chance, go see them live, it's definately worth it."
5,Absolutely Perfect,"There is absolutely no flaw in this album. Every song is a winner. Rewind the beginning and hear Howy Reynolds rambling on of a crazy story that eventually leads into the triumphant anthem ""Automatic"" which is one of my favorite songs and a good openning to a great cd. Every song after that is energetic, unique and awesome. I love it. I also own ""Borders and Boundaries"" and ""Hello Rockview"" and they are also very good as well. This is one of the greatest Punk/Ska albums of all time which are: ""Destruction by Definition""-Suicide Machines, ""Energy""-Operation Ivy, ""Why Do They Rock So Hard?""-Reel Big Fish, ""Evildoers Beware""-Mustard Plug, and ""Casbean Nights""-Catch 22, and ""Hello Rockview""-Less Than Jake. A good buy. Trust Me."
1,Whimpy Horse,I cannot believe they sold this horse to me for $90 plus $30 shipping. It is light and not even a newborn could sit on it without collapsing!! I am sooo disappointed!!!!!!!!!1
4,"Great story, lots of intrigue","Here is a story about gov black projects, nephilim etc...that is quite well done, not preachy. Walter Keith York definitely keeps the readers attention by creating 3 dimensional super-vivid characters and wonderful settings--edge of your seat action sequences as well. Excellent writing style as well.Glass Backwards"
1,"Cheapo, lame Made-for-TV remake of great film","This ""movie"" is really nothing more than the first two episodes of the now-cancelled syndicated TV show. It features cheesy production values, bargain-basement acting and a grade-Z script. The first hour of this movie is basically just a cheapo remake of the classic movie starring the late Brandon Lee, except this made for TV version gets rid of everything that made the movie great, the dark atmosphere, the poetic dialog. The second hour expands the story into some hokum about Crows vs. snakes or something like that. What's next? A ""Crow Adventures"" cartoon on FoxKids in the afternoon?"
4,The Apostle,"Good movie with a look at real people who try to make up for past mistakes, will little result. check it out."
4,typical hypocrite,"Robert Duval plays Sonny, whose contradictions are glaring to viewers, but invisible to the preacher himself; how typical. Another reviewer cited Sonny's conflicts with precision and impressive insight, only to miss the point that displaying the man's faults is the movie's mission. Like the preacher in ""Go Tell It On the Mountain"" by James Baldwin, Sonny serves as an example of a person who tries to follow God, succeeding in some ways and failing in others. We must give him credit for trying. We must grant him appreciation for his achievements. We must also lock him up for his crimes.Note: Baldwin's book, ""GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN,"" is a classic. The flawed preacher in that book is different than Sonny, but both have hypocrisy in their characters."
3,What Exactly is he Trying to Say?,"I am not really sure what to think about this movie. As a Pentecostal myself, I found it to be a good (although slightly exaggerated) portrayal of classic Pentecostalism. However, I am disturbed by Sonny's portrayal. How were we supposed to view him? A hypocrite? A sincere but flawed character? I notice from several reviews that this film is interpreted many different ways, and I can only give it three stars. Great acting, great depiction of Pentecostals, but very ambiguous message."
2,THE APOSTLE,DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. LOVE ROBERT DEVAULL HUNTED IT ALL OVER BECAUSE IT WAS RECOMMENDED BUT FEEL I MADE A BAD PURCHASE
5,"The story of a man who loved God and people, but who sinned","Duvall has the whole life, blesses with the calling and is in tune with God......but good men sin and must redeme themselves and still have the law that they must answer to......very real and exposing.....one of my favorites. Great actoring by Duvall.. Five Stars"
4,Fun to read,"We like this book. But it isn't a favorite like 10 little ladybugs or 8 silly monkeys. However, there are 9 bees, so it kind of fits.The book is still a great read and it helps teach farm animal stuff to the toddler.My 1 year old seems to like it more than the 3 yr old."
1,Buzz-Buzz Busy Bees,"There were two identical new books in my order. It is a sound board book, but makes now sound on the last page (the only page that is suppose to make sound). I have seen this book in other homes and it works when the last page is turned to produce a buzzing sound."
4,not THAT bad,"Okay. So the patterns in this book are not for the hippest, most fasionable items out today, but look at the title. The title is not ""Totally Fashionable Knits to Wear"", but ""Quick Knits to Wear"". That is exactly what is provided in this book, simple patterns that will knit up quick. And honestly, how many books do most of us have where every pattern in it is totally amazing? The directions are straight-forward, there are color pictures included for each design (and I have to say the models do not look ""heavily made up"", just cheesily posed), and the designs are simple enough to complete quickly. I think this book delivers what the title says, simple, quick knits that are wearable, and while not at the height of fashion, not dated either."
1,A disappointment - big one.,"I can't say much without spoiling the plot. What I can say, though, this movie is a big disappointment for me and my partner. It's a waste of money and time, as we were under the impression this would've been another good romantic comedy that one can see on Saturday night. How wrong we were. It's far from sweet as it leaves bitter taste at the end of the movie.Avoid at all cost."
5,Sweet home,"""Sweet Home Alabama"" is one of those movies that is so funny you'll wish you were born and raised in Alabama. Reese Witherspoon give this humor another thing to talk about. This movie proves to their audience that no matter how successful or glamourous you are, you'll always know where you came from. The director and screenplay writer seem to have expressed this by experience. It comes out splendidly. Rent this movie today if you're looking for a great comedy. Then wait a day or two and buy the DVD. You won't be disappointed."
5,Sweet Home Alabama,"I love this movie and got the DVD to replace my old VHS. It came in a good time frame and was packaged well. For some reason, in transit, it came loose in the package getting a scatch so the movie glitches at one point. I was able to run it through my cleaner and fix that and the company I got it from would have no way of knowing what would happen, in transit, so I would order from them again."
2,Buy The Trailer,"The trailer made me want to see this movie. It had led me to believe I would be seeing a madcap screwball comedy of the gag-a-minute variety. Sweet Home Alabama is none of the above. It's a standard heartwarmer. The gags, such as they are, could have been focused to better effect. For whatever reason, they weren't, and they may not have been intended to be. Screwball comedies aren't the end-all-be-all. In fact, they're quite superficial... but then so are standard heartwarmers, and they aren't funny. If they didn't want a screwball comedy, they shouldn't have advertised one, that's all.For what it's worth, Reese Witherspoon does a great job. Her character is very like someone I know, and I'm sure convinced. It's a pity here effort is lost in a cliché.Even more's the pity, cuz if they got the guy who edited the trailer to edit the movie, they might have had something."
3,Funny,"I love a good romantic comedy, so I was really looking forward to this film. I'm a big Reese Witherspoon fan, and she didn't disappoint. I liked that she took a few risks and didn't make Melanie too nice - in fact, there were times I thought she was really obnoxious.The plot was paper thin, though, and it was pretty obvious from the get go who Mel would end up with. Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey were both pretty good, but Dempsey should've been in the movie more. I wanted more exploration of Mel's relationship with her parents, too. Mary Kay Place and Candice Bergen were wasted.This is a decent comedy that will give you a few good laughs, but once you leave the theatre you'll forget about it. I don't think you'll regret seeing it, though I wouldn't rush to the theatre. It would make a great rainy night rental."
4,Cute movie,"This is a Reese Witherspoon classic, and the acting and storyline is great. I would give this movie five stars, but I felt that the ending was too cliched. Melanie's confession that she was relieved when she miscarried should have told her that this was not the place she was meant to be, so I wish she had made the different choice at the movie ending. Still overall, it's a good movie at 4 stars."
3,Funny but relies too much on cliches,"Fashion designer Melanie has got it all - a breakthrough in her career, and a handsome fiance. The only problem is that she's already got a husband, and must get rid of him fast.This movie definitely has its moments, but relies too much on stereotypes, some of them really offensive, to get the full five-stars. The homosexuals, the stereotypical backward southern town with charming-but-below-average-IQ redneck residents dwelling in double-wides, drunken brawls over the pool table, ad nauseum.Still, it's funny, and Reese Witherspoon is always worth watching. Candice Bergen is great as the snotty New York mayor mom. No real language issues or violence to prevent it from being a family film"
5,Amazing,I love this movie. This movie shows people that the grass isnt always greener on the other side. Reese Witherspoon is an amazing actress. Loved everything about this movie.
5,Classic Material,My girls and I can't get enough of this movie. I am sure that this will be a new classic. If you like chick flicks (with one good tear jerking moment) this is the movie to see.
4,It's a chick flick!,"There's no point complaining about how predictable this movie is, or how it follows a formula. I don't watch these movies to suddenly have an epiphany. It's good fluffy fun for a lazy Sunday afternoon or a way to unwind after a stressful day at work.Not the best romantic comedy ever, but the performances by the actors keep this movie going. Great acting by Reese Withspoon (Melanie) and Josh Lucas (Jake). Mary Kay Place and Fred Ward put in great performances as Pearl and Earl, Melanie's backwards parents. The storyline is decent and the ending makes up for everything. There are definitely stereotypes in the movie, but they're there to emphasize the contrasting attitudes of ""hoity-toity"" New Yorkers and Southerners.It's a rent before you buy movie unless you're a Reese Witherspoon fan or a fan of all romantic comedies."
3,Cheesy but cute!,"The movie is pretty silly but entertaining, but the DVD was sort of a disappointment. I have gotten used to being ""wowed"" by DVDs and the extras they offer you and this one is only [OK]. The other possible ending is only vaguely interesting, but it does make you appreciate the current ending all the more!"
4,Reese rocks but the picture is average,"Reese Witherspoon is probably one of the most talented actresses of her generation. She could make moviegoers see a Tom Green movie if she was in it. I just wish she would tackle more roles like she had in Election and Freeway.The movie had its moments and Reese had chemistry with both of her leading men. I loved her scenes with Josh Lucas and I thought she looked wonderful. I also think that she has made much better movies.Reese, you are a very talented woman and I would see any picture you are in! I just thought that this could have been a better movie!"
3,PRANCER RETURNS,"This movie was a very cute & charming movie for young & old alike. However the first movie ""PRANCER"" was much cuter I guess because of the little girl that was portrayed as a stubborn child who did her own thing & was lonely for her deceased mom & had a grumpy dad who worked hard to provide, the movie sad but happy at the end."
5,Great Movie,"This movie had a great meaning about love and how things in life can go wrong,and if we have a heart of love it will work out,also it was a clean family movie,don't see much of them in todays world."
1,Purchased this movie by mistake!,"Wanted to purchase the original beauty and the beast movie, but purchased this by mistake. Disney should really give up on trying to create sequels, spin offs, or an expanded versions of its classic movies. They never turn out good!"
4,Career Books I,I received the Career Discovery Project and I've found it very helpful in assisting me with my career change. Lots of great advice and full of of fun and interesting quizzes. I recommend it to anyone looking for career advice/feedback.
4,Audio commentary makes it all worth while,"Whether you liked the episode or not, if you're a Xena fan, this is a must have. First, the making of featurette is excellent. It really gives you a detailed glimpse into what it takes to make one episode of the show. Then there's the audio track. It's worth it just to hear Lucy Lawless's original Kiwi accent, but you get so much more out of it. Listening to Lucy, Renee and Rob explain how they painstakingly created each set and each shot, the emotions going through the actor's minds and what Rob was thinking as he put it all together. The episode itself, I don't think is one of their better ones, but after listening to the commentary, I can't help but appreciate all of the work that went into it. So why not 5 stars? The episode felt very similar to Xena's trip to China with Lao Ma. I think that was a better episode, hence the 4 stars. By the way, Lucy and Renee both make fun of the plot holes."
1,Xena?,"For a fan who has watched this series since the beginning, after watching this final I doubt anyone will recognize the characters at all. It is not the Xena and Gabrielle we came to love. The plot is scattered; the script is just plain bad. Sure to be known as the worse finale ever."
1,Very Disappointing,I am a very big fan of Xena: Warrior Princess. That's why I was very disappointed in the series finale. I wish they would have stayed in Greece or something or at least gotten a better story line. I think they should have brought back some old characters or something and why did Xena have to die? Grrr... A very disappointing ending to one of my favorite shows :o(
5,This Music Personifies How Real Punk Rockers Are!,"Mike Ness and the rest of Social D were a bunch of ruthless punks out to have a good time and share their music with the rest of us. They (along with two other bands) were the first punk artists to have a North American tour in the early 80's. Through the experiences from this tour came one of Social D's most poignant songs, ""Another State of Mind"", where singer Mike Ness was being faced with either continuing the tour or quitting like some of his buddies did. Many teens related to these punk icons and believed in what they stood for. For me, this band will forever be a part of who I am. Don't forget to listen to ""Telling Them"" and ""Creeps."" (Lee)"
1,Zoom Modem Review,"This modem was defective because it made my brand new laptop computer unresponsive. I had to call my computer manufacturer for help. With the technician's assistance, my computer's Windows operating system was restored."
3,Not up to my expectations,Not as enjoyable as I thought it would be from the interview with her niece by Teri Gross on NPR.jaktravels
5,New edition available in the US,"For everyone in the US interested in the new edition of this text, Dancing the Flame of Life, we recently came to an agreement with the UK publisher to make it available in the United States. It is now up for pre-orders on Amazon.com:Dancing the Flame of Life: The Vital Principles of Yoga. They should be shipping around the first week of January.Dona Holleman is an exceptional teacher and writer in the field of Yoga, such that her texts have historically been required reading in our teacher trainings. We're so glad her newest edition is finally available!"
5,Dreams can come true if you're true to your self,"Our heroine Muriel, dumpy, suburban, open, guileless, trusting, who has a corrupt Dad, an oppressed Mum, two siblings who are variously lazy and stupid, falls in love with and marries her dream ""man"" - what else but a white, blue-eyed blonde South African born swimming champion who is the quintessence of selfishness, self aggrandisement, vanity, and shallowness - but finds ""true"" love in friendship with her crippled buddy played superbly by Rachel Griffith. Some stupendous and memorable moments, one being when Muriel's mother sets fire to her backyard with its Hills Hoist in its centre. Funny, touching, and great feel good movie. Peopled by some terrific characters. The ABBA scene is a gem! One to own and revisit."
4,Modern Classic -- deserves better DVD treatment,"It's an ugly duckling story. Muriel is an unpopular girl living in a dingy town with highly dysfunctional family. She longs to escape her fate by listening to ABBA and dreaming about becoming the ""Dancing Queen"" wedding bride. Although it is stylized and takes place in Australia, the theme is universal. Instead of swimming in your misery, grow up and find your own life.This DVD, on the other hand, was released awhile ago and in need of better treatment. Although it is certainly serviceable, I found the images to be soft looking and audio a tad bright sounding. Give us an anamorphic video with remastered audio and some real extras (commentary track would be fun)."
1,Awful!,This is the kind of movie that made me want ot throw up! It was sad it was depressing and it was just damn awful! A woman wants something her whole life and she is taken advantage treated like crap and used! If this is feminism I will say I don't want to be part of it!!!!!!!!!!!
4,An Inspirational Gem,"This movie should be shown as therapy to someone who might be suffering from low self esteem. Muriel is a wonderful character I am sure a lot of people can relate to. There are a lot of reviews here that already explain what the movie is about, so I'll skip that. If you need a feel good movie, this is it. I promise it will rank among your favorite films after you see it.Best Scene: the ending of the film when Muriel comes back to Porpoise Spit to claim her best friend. They tell the popular girls off and head for the taxi. The song ""Dancing Queen"" is playing during this scene. It is very uplifting as both girls finally say goodbye to Porpoise Spit."
4,GREAT CD,"this CD is fantastic. great songs. STOP is great if your into that diva, singin the blues type music. TEA is a classic must buy!"
5,Sam Brown can deliver the goods,"I first heard Sam Brown on the George Harrison Tribute DVD. She is a singer from England, and I had not heard her before. Well she rocked the house at the tribute, so I went to the computer and ordered a CD as soon as I could. This is one of those albums that the more you hear it the better you like it. Sam Brown is one hell of a singer and has the pipes to prove it. No Pro Tools tuning up for this girl! I plan to get more of her CD's in the near future. Check her out!!"
3,A little over halfzees,I ordered this on a wim from the library + was surpised that I liked it. Gave it 3 instead of a 4 beacuse I'm pretty sure this won't b making it into rotation. So I thought halfzees was a pretty good scale of how good it is. This is purely instrumental(in case that wasn't obvious)so don't expect any singing. I went in not expecting to much but the String Quartets renditions of Dance Dance + A Little Less Sixteen Candles made me like this cd. Good if u need some thing to help u take it down a notch and chillax. I'd go for the used version if u wanna check it out because it is way cheaper.
1,Too sweet,"As some other reviewers have also pointed out, these fig bars are extremely sweet. While I am satisfied with purchase experience and the condition of the product, their taste compels me to give a 1-star rating."
1,Open and inspect when you receive this.,"I purchased this suncatcher panel. I ordered it as a gift for a friend. Once the friend opened it up, we found that it was broken in three places. Also, it didnt come with the hooks to put it up with, just the chain. The breakage was where the shipper should have noticed it before shipping. Beware! Make sure you open and inspect this before time runs out as it did on me. Beautiful but broken. I am stuck with it now. I had to purchase another for my friend."
4,Finally...real rock & roll,"Over the past few years we've been inundated with garbage pseudo-punk and rap-rock. Jet is back to good old fashioned Rock & Roll. Just guitar driven rock. Many younger listeners may not like it because they're used to the crap that's been produced for most of the 90's and today. Jet definitely brings back the sounds of AC/DC and old Aerosmith (not the ballads).With bands like Jet and Velvet Revolver, Rock and Roll is back after a way too long hiatus."
5,Very Good,I think that this is one of the most original CDs in a while. Its not like everyone elses. Buy it now! There's no way you cannot like this CD.
5,JET is awesome!,EVERY song from their cd 'Get Born' is great! This aussie band rocks! If you don't have the CD you really need to buy it!
5,i luv jet,"this album rocks, jet are so unlike every other cliche band around and 4 that, i luv em...............ggooooooooooo jetttttttt"
3,"Unoriginal, But Good","If this was the first time this material was ever presented, 'Get Born' could easily be a classic. This is straight-up rock and roll, loud, raucous, and fun. Unfortunately for Jet, it's also decades-old rock and roll. Nothing on here is in any way original, but I'll be damned if ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl"" isn't a fantastic tune regardless, and ""Rollover D.J."" even features some incredible organ playing by the legendary Billy Preston.Standout tracks: Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Cold Hard B****, Move On"
1,F***ing Ripoffs,"these punk are ripping off The White Stripes, who is by far the best revival group out there, alongside The Strokes. when i heard the radio single, i was pissed, because it sounded exactly like ""Screwdriver"" by The White Stripes and they were copycatting Jack White's lyrical style. don't buy this s***, buy ""Elephant"" instead!"
1,What VH1 tries to convince me is rock 'n' roll,"Along with other lame bands such as the White Stripes and the Strokes, these guys give garage rock a terrible name. Various great band's riffs are ripped off by these poseurs. Just buy an Iggy Pop or AC/DC album and you shall see what I am talking about. One of the worst bands ever."
1,Plagiarism,"I will never understand how people can be so stupid as to buy someone elses original material badly rehashed by hack musicians. Usually people are charged with recieving stolen goods, yet this obviously stolen rubbish is a huge hit. These guys should be ashamed. They have no integrity."
3,mind candy,"It is true- Jet blatantly rip off AC/DC, Nazareth, Iggy Pop, the Stones, etc. They aren't original, they aren't subtle, and I think they set a record for the number of times ""yeah!"", ""alright!"", and ""whoo!"" is said on a single album. That being said, this is still a good rock album. Turn it up, roll down the windows, and hit the road. And I disagree that they should be compared to the White Stripes or Strokes. They remind me more of the Black Crowes in that they wear their influences on their sleeves but still put out some great rock. Are they the flavor of the month? Sure. Will they be on ""classic rock"" stations as soon as they are pulled off the ""new rock"" stations? Sure. As long as they stay away from the average-at-best ballads, they're alright in my book."
4,Get Born...,"I love songs on this CD and I hate songs on this CD. It is very different than a lot of the music that has been coming out the closest I can think of to compare them to is the Strokes. I love the slow soft songs as I think the lyrics and music work well for Jet. But I know some people like ""Cold Hard Bitch"" and ""Are you Going to be my Girl"" which I liked when I first heard but the songs have been played so much that now I want to throw something at my radio anytime those songs come on and I also skip them in the CD too. I like the rest of the CD it is just getting over played the radio plays great things into the ground. If you like any of the songs on the radio then you will like this CD. Personally, my favorite song on the CD is ""Look what you have done""."
2,Too Predictable,"After one listen to this CD, which thankfully I don't own, here's the low(let)down. I heard their radio singles and thought to myself, here's the next band who will be loved by the same folks who buy in to music by the likes of the White Stripes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Hives among others. To me, all of this music sounds like a rehash of mainstream material coming in part from the 60s 70s and 80s. AC/DCs definitely in there, yeah--rip from a band not originally known for, well, originality. To get back to my point, sure enough, this CD has shown up in collections of folks I know who also have the other aforementioned albums. Predictability. You buy this album and you are cool because every goon out there with a radio knows every lyric to every song--not because the music and lyrics are at all new, heartfelt, or groundbreaking. It won't be long until this music gathers dust in a bargain bin."
5,Two thumps up for Amazon!!!,"I live in Thailand which is so far from the US, but the CD still arrived far earlier than estimated date without any scratch! Thank you very much Amazon!"
4,Good but not very original,"This is a good album and I enjoy listening to it but they steal from so many bands. Their songs either sound like the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, or the Beatles and on Are you gonna be my girl they flat out steal from iggy pop. I mean it is a good album and at least they are making music that sounds like good bands and not all the crap out their today. I just hope on their next album they get all little more original and their song writing gets a little better. If you like this check out the rock revival band SILVERTIDE!!down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide"
4,Rock and Roll that got this mom's heart racing,After hearing Are You Gonna Be My Girl on the radio I bought the CD cold-knowing nothing at all about the group. The music has a 60's 70's classic rock feel with a modern edge that gets me going at anytime. I think I would even go see them in concert although I have not been to a live rock and roll concert since the late 70's when I saw Led Zeppelin as a teen.(Why didn't I save that black t shirt)?This CD rocks for all age's.
3,This band was so cool at the time,"I didn't really like the whole cd, just a few select songs, luckily the cd was cheap in the first place."
4,Pretty dang good!!,"Well Jet is one of the very very few new bands that i even like, with todays music all rap and country and hip hop. now some people dont like the thought that most of these songs are covered but i have to say they do a very well job of doing it. today it's rare to heard a band do a lead and jet actually has enough talent to do so. maybe their next album will be all original and Get Born was just done to see how fans would react to their sound. and if they last i can really see them getting better with time as all bands do. hopefully jet can carry on rock'n roll before people lose sight of it, and again it is a great album.~Livin On Rock'n Roll~"
3,Not Bad,This is a catchy record. It helps that iPod commercials made the song familiar to me. But there are SO many familiar rock sounds in this album. I'm hearing Iggy Pop and AC/DC all the time in the tunes and riffs. The ballads even seem familiar. I suppose you could treat this album as a tribute to old school rock. It is actually nice to hear this sound without having to switch to the classic rock station and hear the same old songs. Good straght ahead old edgy rock.
1,"Extra Inspired, Unoriginal!","Jet prooves that local cover bands can get record deals to. all you need to do is write the worst lyrics in music, recycle an already good idea and add a splash of whatever is popular at the time. And there you have Jet in a nutshell. From flat out ripping AC/DC and Oasis to other rock bands that do it 100 times better. this album is ass on CD. It's [...] i tell you! MTV and the now generation will love this crap, But if you want to waiste your money pick up a copy of 80's ear pleaser Pac-Man Fever! atleast you'll actually have a peice of retro instead of a cheap immitation."
2,...,"Sexy Sadie, by the Beatles:Sexy Sadie, what have you done? You've made a fool of everyone.Look What You've Done, by Jet:Look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone.Not only does the song sound exactly like late Beatles music in its style and delivery - and Saxy Sadie in particular - it lifts lyrics almost verbatim."
3,its very new age yes,"first off i dont have the import of this i just quickly clicked on the album.... i have the american version ANYWAY.... this albums OKAY but really new age you know. For those who like new age rock,,,,"
4,First three songs are awesome,Jet has a bit of a unique sound. The first three songs are awesome. I could live without the ballads.
5,Get Born Rocks!,"This band is being touted by the British Press as the next big thing and after hearing the CD I know why. They are amazing. The Cd is a good mix of ballads and hard rock. Jet can't help draw comparisons to the Rolling Stones, mostly because they play really good hard rock, amazing hard rock that is rare today, and they have that aura of coolness surrounding them that is so intriguing and rare. A must buy!"
1,THIS is why people download music illegally,"""are you gonna be my girl?"" I think that's what this song is called. This single just grates on my nerves. I had a friend ask me if I had heard it and if I liked it. And I said ""Sure, but I liked it much better when Iggy Pop recorded it and called it Lust for Life.""Pastiche is one thing. Plagarism is another. And listening to the rest of the CD ( I didn't buy it, I was roped into hearing it by same said friend) reminds me why so many people are still downloading music illegally. They here this song, they like it, and don't want to pay 18 dollars for it and 10 or 12 songs that sound just like it. This is really sad."
1,Waste of my life energy,"I found that when I tried to adjust the micrometer, the top nut would unscrew causing the internal spring to shoot across the garage. After much frustration I was able to torque the lug nuts. A week later when I went to check the lug nuts I had the same problem. Finally the wrench stopped clicking. The company never replied to my message. I got a gift card from Amazon and a healthy dislike for Cal-Tech."
4,Awsome acting/story but sucky end...,"I've never paid any attention to the holocaust until this movie... god these germans were mad people, I just can not believe these things actually happened like only 60 years ago on this planet! I prolly had not cried like in 10 years until I saw the scene when this kid confessed to his girlfriend's mother... what a bunch miserable people actually allowed this to happen... see like today I can vote bush out if I think he's dangerous... well if germans couldn't vote then at least they could assasinate hitler, I'm not trying to promote violence, but if one man could make millions to suffer like that... I still feel like vomitting...well what a shocking story... all good actors in this movie... this sucky director ruined whole movie by having an ending like that... it's like watching a schwarzenegger movie... you know things like that don't happen in real life... duh..."
5,Finally on DVD,"I showed this film to my classes when I was a high school German teacher, and they always enjoyed it. The true story of a courageous young man's harrowing trip through the ever-shifting, uncertain days of WWII in Poland and Russia. He has to be one of the luckiest or unluckiest figures of WWII, depending on your take on the measures he must go to in order to survive. This film really put Agnieszka Holland's on the map as a director. Marco Hofschneider's performance is brilliant. A deadly serious subject that is softened with delightful, light-hearted moments, ""Europa, Europa"" is not to be missed. A must-see for those who enjoyed Polanski's ""The Pianist."""
4,Living in Fear,"Marco Hoffschneider plays young Solomon, who in order to avoid being sent into the ghettos of WWII Germany, hides his true Jewish identity. Solly gets into all sorts of close call situations, but I must state that if it seems a bit unbelievable, you should know that the film is based on the autobiography of Solomon Perel. Rich in textures and colors, the film offers an objective view at the other side of Germans, through the eyes of one Jewish boy."
4,Interesting movie.,"The movie Europa Europa contains an interesting story about a boy trying to escape the Nazi regime by eventually posing as a Nazi himself. The obsticles he overcomes seem extremely bizzare and unbelieveable, however the fact that he overcomes these obstacles makes the movie worth watching. I must admit, however, that some of the sexual scenes and nudity in the movie are unecessary and some are extremely disturbing. Overall, this movie creates a great impact and seems to accurately portray what the living conditions of each class would have obtained."
4,Okay Book,"I only rated this 4 stars because I'm not a big sports fan but it's actually a good book.This is where Kristy finally gets interested in boys(in this case, Bart Taylor)and she also starts a softball team for little kids.To give you an idea of how young this kids are, I'll tell you that Gabbie is on the team!It's funny!"
1,the masher,"this was the worst waste of money i have ever seen. not only did it not form a vacuum with my counter top, but it mangled the apples, did not keep contact with the apple's skin and only periodically did a peeling job. don't waste your time or money."
5,Wow.,"Wow - I heard about these Marines at Fort Pendleton who were involved with a civilian killing in Iraq, but never heard about it directly from them - till now. This documentary gives a realistic take about what war can do to good men. You know who you want to believe - but you know there's more to the story. If you want to see a ""real"" thriller check this one out. It's a true-life film. Interviews with most of the involved parties. Make up your own mind."
1,A disgrace to the art,"This is an old school style representation of Jujitsu. Something like what you could have ordered from a classified ad in the back of a magazine in the late 60's with a title like ""Learn the secret art of Jujitsu in just 30 minutes: now YOU can kick sand in the face of that beach bully"". But, there is more to Jujitsu than technique. A book like this can actually be very dangerous in the wrong hands. There is almost no theory presented here, and TOTAL disregard for the code of ethics which one should follow when pursuing ANY education concerning martial arts. Save your money and be happy this book is only available used and is currently out of print."
4,IT'S A GREAT BOOK!,This book is great for learning the techniques of jujitsu. Although I was disapointed with the lack of philosaphy and history of the art.
3,Good information,"I like Tegner. Unlike the comments of a previous reviewer i find Tegner is grounded in reality. He gives you the facts about movies/TV and how what is shown is vastly different than real life. He explains how to do things in a practical way, and how a lifetime of study is not required. Tegner was a pioneer, long before Bruce Lee asked people to question tradition, Tegner was already giving the answers. The introduction in his book ""Complete Book of Self-Defense"" is pure gold. It contains solid information that puts self-defense into it's proper perspective."
3,Very good film to say the least,"I disagree with what the P{geon Sisters say about men being lucky and all but everything else in the film is fine. The characters of Oscar and Felix are excellent opposites though this Felix isn't into opera like the one on the tv show (that was the late Tony Randall's reallife hobby). Murray is not the fat, clueless one he was on the tv shopw. This Murray the Cop (in the film) has more depth."
4,A Couple Of Oddballs,"First I love Lemon and Matthau. Adore the work of both men and as a team they are wonderful! I liked the series better than the film, but, still enjoy the film. Jack Klugman and Tony Randall I think fit the roles more fully. Not to undermine Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau or their performances in the least. The basis of the series is basically the same as the film. A divorced slob lets his meticulous, hypochondriac best friend who is recently going through divorce live with him. Soon Oscar (Matthau) no longer worries his friend Felix (Lemon) might commit suicide but instead that he may kill him. It is funny, though the series is funnier and I did not much care for the end of the film which if easily forgettable."
1,"Sadly, it did not meet with our expectations",The disc was ruined and would not play.....was not able at the time to request money back. It was very disappointing.
3,The Return of Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau,"After ten whole years, Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers are return in the same funny story: The diamont of the Pink Panther is missing and the generals of Loughas won't Inspector Clouseau to find it. Iven if Sellers' playing is --always-- perfect, the film was having two big fauls (wrongs): Catherine Schell's Lady Litton performance is awfull and Christopher Plummer's Sir Charles Litton has nothing to do with David Niven's Sir C. Litton in 1963. Any way, on the other hand, this film has munny funny scenes. Followed by THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, the most PERFECT comedy in the famous series."
2,Not a very chocolatey smell,"This wasn't particularly chocolatey to my nose. With a name like ""chocolate"", I expected something that would remind me of a candy bar."
3,Ordinary and Entertaining,"Named after a Morrissey track, The Ordinary Boys couldn't sound less like Moz or the Smiths (except when they steal the riff of ""What Difference Does It Make""). Their straight up Brit rock on Over the Counter Culture falls between The Libertines and Feeder, with roots in The Specials (whom they cover with a rollicking version of ""Little Bitch""). The songs of singer Preston and guitarist William J. Brown are overly concerned with bucking the status quo (to name only two of seven: the title track and ""Robots and Monkeys""), which might be more effective if their own music weren't such a showcase of English top-of-the-pops. Yet their words convey their meaning with simplicity - a feat in any of the arts - and they are pretty catchy boys. Not essential by any means, but entertaining nonetheless."
5,Wow,This girl is amazing!!!!! She's wonderful!!! Her voice is unreal and perfect and sweet!! I am SO glad I picked this one up!
4,Jazz Music,Great singer. I love it. I played this CD over and over again. I wish she would come to Seattle so I can see her in performing in live. Thanks great cd.
4,Wonderful!,"This little gal gives me hope in a Brittany Spears world...what a talent! I only pray she has a good manager and the wherewithal to stick with it because she has the ability to mature into a truly great vocalist. My favorite pieces on the album are the simple ones, without the overproduced and overwhelming orchestra. Summertime, which starts out wonderfully left me, at the end, wishing it had stayed simple. That's just a matter of personal taste but I would love to see her make an album accompanied by just a guitar, a la Tuck & Patti. This girl has a real future!"
2,Aromatherapy book,This is a re-published book from the 90's. I was disappointed that the author published it again with a new cover but the contents of the book were entirely the same as the old version. So the old version was no longer available for sale. I love the book but do not appreciate the author's deception. This book is available in the earlier copy at your public library. So read it before you invest.
4,This book is great for beginners,"This was the first book I puchased on aromatherapy, and I must say that it is the best book I have read!!! Not only does she include recipes, she also includes the essential oil reference guide, which is my favorite part, because she gives you a breakdown of not only the origin name, but what the physical and the psycho-emotional benefits are to the essential oils. She also gives you a headstart on how to make your own formulas, by including a blending chart. Please pick up this book, if not any other book."
2,Not a good book at all.,"After reading a review of this book, I was very much looking forward to reading it. What a letdown! The plot is completely implausible, senseless, and trivial.Also, this book has been categorized as science fiction. It most definitely is not science fiction. There is no science in the book other than the profession of the physicists.As a side note, there were a few sloppy editing mistakes that got through to print. A few words were mispelled and there were a few sentences that did not make a bit of sense.Be warned. Stay away. There are much better books out there. This one is a waste of time. For instance, try the Time Traveler's Wife. The Time Traveler's Wife has similar goals as Oh Pure and Radiant Heart, but it actually pulls off what it set out to accomplish."
5,One of the all-time greats,"What more is there to be said? This is one of music's giants at the very peak of his powers, fusing the intimacy of folk with ballsy rock attitude and creating something entirely new and entirely brilliant. It's scathing, moving, and hilarious, and it has never been surpassed. Even if that weren't true, it's hard not to love an album with lyrics like, ""God said to Abraham, 'Kill me a son'/Abe say, 'Man, you must be puttin' me on'/God say, 'No'/Abe say, 'What?'/God say, 'You can do what you want, Abe but, the next time you see me comin', you better run'/Abe say, 'Where you want this killin' done?'/God said, 'Out on Highway 61'""."
2,"should be cheaper... same $ as Blonde on Blonde, 1/2 music","or BoB should be more expensive, perhaps. Look, Blonde on Blonde is a double album with all the mythos that implies. Highway 61 is a single album. They are both beyond perfect... there are about five Dylan albums which can't be compared with the work of mortals (we all agree about this--the question is which five) and for me, this is one of them. Nevertheless, you get a lot less TIME with this one. This album ought to be $6.99 if Blonde on Blonde is $9.99. Otherwise, I feel like I am being ripped off.I had all the vinyl, all of them, through Knocked out Loaded; I sold all the vinyl (sue me, I live in New York with kids, there's no room for vinyl, and I personally cannot hear the difference) and now, if I am going to buy them all again... Basement Tapes for $9.99, of COURSE, but this one for 40 minutes of music... I can live without it. I even have to live without John Wesley Harding. Hard Rain for $6.99 was a good deal."
5,My Favorite Dylan,"Someone mentioned that this is Dylan's first electric album. I didn't realize that. His acoustic albums seem pretty darn electric too.I like Dylan's long complex songs and this album has two of the best: ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" and ""Desolation Row."" These songs are practically like novels in their depth. I still get lost in them and marvel at Dylan's genius on each hearing."
4,Good stuff,"The auto charger works as advertised. The headset is fine too, but i have a bluetooth headset, so i dont use it too often. The phone cover is kind of lame though, but I dont like them anyways."
3,Magnesium bullfloat package,The float looks good but I didn't receive the two handles that was advertised with it.
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this would ""drive"" on it's own. As it turns out, the rider moves up and down, but the ATV just sits still. I gave it as a gift and was a bit emabarrased to discover this after the fact. A bit dissapointing."
3,"fine for what it is, but is NOT a track lamp","Solid, stable lamp. The baffles contain the light well from spilling out to the sides -- handy if you're trying to read in bed while your partner sleeps, but at the cost of not providing much light for a given bulb wattage. The major problem is that the product's very name is a lie: this isn't in any sense a track lamp; the pods can rotate but are fixed in place. There's no ""track"" aspect at all."
4,"A Fun, Keep You Guessing Mystery","I grabbed this book off of a friends shelf while on vacation. I love murder mysteries but have lately come across some dull, slow stories. Blood Atonement was the complete opposite, even with my lack of fishing knowledge. The charecters are interesting and keep the story exciting. Wallace's dry humor was an added benifit to lighten many situations. I couldn't put the book down. I recommend Blood Atonement and look forward to the next Dahlgren Wallace Mystery."
3,tiny print,"I just recieved this book and have looked forward to reading it. To my dismay, the print is much smaller than usual and difficult to read without eye strain. I find I can only read a couple of pages at a time."
2,Good Foundation,This dvd is very informative and well presented. After looking at it for the first time i could not put down my ephiphone les paul custom.
2,BORING SOFT POP DROWNS THIS ONE,"I really got excited when this CD was released and loved the single ""SEXUAL"".I was so excited. I was expecting it to be better than her first.'ABOVE THE CLOUDS"" was an ok song."" LOVE ONE ANOTHER"" was pretty good and had a nice message.after the second song things get a little messy.The third song "" SPIRITUAL VIRGINITY"" is a silly pop song that lacks in every way imaginable.""OBJECT OF YOUR DESIRE"" follows with another song that sounds too soft for the same woman who sings the next song ""SEXUAL"". An exciting turn that doesnt last long. Song after song is slow, boring and unenjoyable. Track 9 finally picks up the pace a little with it's somewhat catchy ""Don't wanna stop""."" IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND"" a track that is the only second highlight of the album. Not suprising, the track that follows is a boring silly pop song. ""IM FREE"" has a good message that I enjoyed hearing,but Amber could have done it better. Only worth buying for 2 tracks."
2,Amber's voice is too weak,"Amber is a girl from Germany who is pretty unsuccessful over here. But advertisementstell us all the time that she is doing well in the US dance charts .Her known song ""Sexual"" is included and so is the duet ""If I coul read yourmind"" (from Studio 45) with Ultra Nate and Jocely Enriquez . This is Amber's second album. It's on ZYX Music in Germany,which is already telling: it's straight and simple dance, not very sizzling,but not bad work either. For me, it's too boring. In the end, it has a goodproduction quality, and some lyrics are even quite meaningful (""Love oneanother""). It's an ok album, but that's basically it. Nothing spectacular"
4,"For beginner/intermediate player, insightfull yet outdated.","Shows reader how to disect the elements of harness racing and sets up a plausible system, while being light and humorous reading. The system offered is simple and fast, but I haven't been able to show a profit with it. The system may now be outdated or localized to his home track. But whatever the case, the aspiring player needs only to be able to combine these elements in the right way for their track to win."
4,This is an accurate book about Egyptian,"I like this book, but it is quite difficult to use. In it, the author criticizes Budge by saying that he is inaccurate, but I think that Budge is just at accurate in his own way as Mercer is in his. Budge, on the other hand, makes it easier to understand Egyptian."
3,Question on editing voice files on digital recorders,"I bought the Olympus VN1800 and used it for about a week, and found my biggest frustration is that you can't edit any voice files that you record. In other words, if you wanted to add on to an existing file, you can't. You have to create a new file to record more information. In addition, you can't edit any portion of the file, for example, if you had a long list of items to do for a given day, you can't edit the file to remove those that you took care of, and don't want on the recorder anymore. Are there any recorders with this capability, and if so, which are they? Thanks much."
2,Value Dropping quick,"I have use Tubro Tax for a long time, but the value is dropping off quick. Might as well just get the ""basic"" version as the ""premier"" has even fewer features than last year. I was disappointed that they dropped the ""Tax Forcaster"" funtion from 2003. I did not have any problem installing, but was forced to do a complete reinstall with an update corrupted the program. But the overall quality and value is declining. My advice is just stay with the basic if you don't need to do the state return and hope the Intuit company takes notice and starts to improve their products."
1,Grow old finishing your return with this product!!!,"Do not buy this product if you have tax schedules beyond the simple EZ forms. I have tried to use this software to handle 4 rental properties (a situation that is suppose to be the purpose for TurboRax Premier). It took over 30 minutes for the program to incorporate last year's tax form data, and then another 15 minutes to save the file. And I am using one of the fastest computers on the market (Macintosh G5 185 GHz 1 GB DDR SDRAM). It crawls through each calculation. I can use a manual calculator and hand enter the information on the forms faster!! I do not know much about computer programmming, but it is clear that this software must have been written for only the simplest of needs.I had the same problem last year, but hoped that surely the company would have improved things.... but no, it is actually worse this year!Use at your own risk....."
1,DO NOY BUY THIS SOFTWARE!,"I have used Turbo Tax for many years. If you want to file your taxes this year-- choose another program. After completing my return, I tried to download final forms and updates and have spent well over 27 hours trying to do so. I have uninstalled, reinstallled, searched my computer for files, deleted anything related, gone to the support website numerous times. Finally, I did the only thing that may work, requested a refund and bought Tax Cut. Several people I know have had the same problems. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!"
5,Great cover!,"I purchased one of these for my Casio Privia PX-330, and it is a beautiful cover, indeed. I am very happy."
2,Uncomfortable and odd length cord,"Only when reading here did I discover that the unequal cord lengths on my earphones was a feature not a mistake. No matter - these earphones went back. I never really got a chance to decide how nice the sound could be, the earplugs were so incredibly uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for two minutes. I don't think I have weird ears (people don't point and faint), so I assume that the fault was that of the earplugs. I went back to my old favorite; Koss Plugs, and am happy once again."
3,Great Product but...,"I returned the item because it was not suitable for me. Although it's easy to use, accurate, rugged and included a well detailed map of the US, but I had two problems with it. First, a minor problem is that it doesn't run on batteries so any move with the power cable will turn it off, and if you plug it at home it's from wall to adapter then to voice then to GPS device. Second, and most importantly to me, it's impossible to find a software that helps you download your trails and update your maps, feature that is a must for me as i use it overseas and not in the US and i do a lot of offroading and i need to edit my trails and trace my own routes. However, I recommend this item for anyone who doesn't have my personal requirements."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I bought this unit 5 months ago and have already gone through 2 of them. The first I used lightly around town for 3 months, then the unit's touch screen stopped responding, rendering it useless.I returned the unit to lowrance, and received a replacement unit a month later.The FIRST DAY that I used this replacement unit, it died within 30 minutes of powering it on. I drove about 7 miles with it and the screen started flickering, becoming faded, then inverted, then black. Now it powers on with a black screen. Useless.I've gotten very little use out of this unit for the price and now I wish I had gotten a better known brand of auto GPS. The problems this unit seems to have with overheating and poor customer service shouldnt be overlooked.When it works it's great (though heavy and clunky), but for me it mostly doesnt work...Buy at your own risk!"
3,"Gorgeous movie, crappy ending","Visually, this movie was stunning. I also thought the directing was pretty good. I loved the action scenes (wanted more!!), especially the scenes where he is ripping apart tanks and running across the desert. Very cool!!The storyline was fantastic and I was really enjoying the movie, but then the end came. And it was bad. Half the people I know who saw this movie didn't understand what happened at the end and neither do I. Is it some reference from the comic book? What the heck is up with the blobby cloud that is supposedly his dad? I don't have a clue! A better explanation of the last 20-30 minutes of the movie would have made it a LOT better in my eyes. I don't like a movie that I can't understand what is going on."
4,3.5 stars.,"First of all these 1 star reviewers don't know what a bad movie is! The movie they had in mind was a simple plotted action movie with non stop violence and a thrill a minute special effects. I know that for a fact, because that is what I expected. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the lousy director. He had no sense of screen direction at all! The story does drag a bit, and the acting was pretty bad. I'd say rent this. Not a complete waste of time. Better time spent watching this then talking with you family right?"
1,Give me a remote control with ultra fast forward button,You need a 16-speed DVD-ROM drive to view this move ! It is that boring. What a cheap remake.
4,best hulk ever,"This hulk is more believable, more human and more likeable. The actor made you want to embrace the poorly treated creature and beg them to understand him instead of trying to inaliate him"
2,"The HULK, ...who let the plot out?!!","After viewing the much anticipated and overly hyped Hulk movie I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Ang Lee's ""King Lear"" based version of the story drudged on and on and on -establishing character, background stories, sub-plots and yack yack yack. The Hulk does not actually appear in the first third of the picture. There was so much story that there was almost no creature and therein lies the main problem with the film. Viewers want a large green rampaging monster with a human side tortured by the fear of releasing a monster on humanity. What we got was an intellectually intense complicated story with constant yack yack yack yack yack dialog. Where was the monster? As far as the story it was intelligent, involved and worth watching as a struggle between father and son. But I came for an angry green behemoth pursued by a world that did not understand or want him. In general, there was a lot of plot getting in the way of a good movie."
3,Too Much Talk.... HULK SMASH!!!,"I don't usually write really short reviews, but there's a first time for everything...Acting ok.Special FX, fun.MOVIE TOO LONG!!TOO MUCH STORY!!!TAKE OUT 20 MINUTES OR HULK SMASH!!!YAAAAAAAGH!!!You see, this is the spirit of Hulk that we fans are looking for!!Buh-bye."
1,Just bad,"This is the way hollywood usually works. This time it was the Sam Raimis Spiderman that set out this boom of making movies from the classic comic superheroes. Hulk dives straight to the lowest cast in this series. It`s just so embarassinly ridiculous and same time way too serious for beeing a superhero film. This movie is split into a drama-part and an action-part. Director Ang Lee, who has made before wonderful drama and e way better action than this, isn`t really the one to be blaimed for this pancake. Film that has almost 10 producers and writers holds the name of its director usually only for a the markening. Still the best two superhero movies to date are Tim Burtons Batman and especially Batman -return."
3,it was just plain weird!,"OK the hulk is fine, but it was just weird!the dad was sick and the hulk isn't supposed to be a meanie!and the scene with him and the dogs fighting was disgusting!"
5,I can descibe this movie in in 5 words,BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!BUY THIS! If you can't tell I'm using the force to influence your purchase.. seriously.. BUY IT!
5,"Different from the Newer One, But Good","I have seen both the Eric Bana and the Edward Norton ""Hulks,"" and I like both, but I like the Bana version better.The Bana version is darker, slower, more psychological, and the computer graphics (the backgrounds, fades, etc., but not the Hulk himself) are very psychedelic and very interesting.The Bana version ends where the Norton version begins.The general in Bana is a much more complex and interesting character, and so is the Connelly character (Liv Tyler in Norton).In both, the graphics of the super-heroes are LAME.But I don't care.I would rather see a movie with an interesting plot and interesting characters than an interesting CG giant.I will say for the Norton version, however, that the long sequences at the beginning, in Brazil, are by far the best part of that one."
3,Show some emotion!,"I think if I saw a 15 foot tall green ""hulk"" coming out of the woods, or bouncing around the desert, or ripping up the concrete in San Francisco, I'd probably scream and soil my pants big time!! At least show a little more emotion than heavy breathing. Whatever happened to blood-curdling screams?"
2,Thank goodness for that elasticized waistband!,"Being as this flick is based on a comic book in which a dude gets riled and turns into a big green cartoon monster, it should come as no surprise when Eric Bana's character flies into a pique of rage and, coincidentally enough, also turns into a big green cartoon monster. Which is a long-winded way of saying the CGI in ""The Hulk"" is so bad it makes Harryhausen's stop-motion technique look like it came from the future. As for story, well, the cartoon monster breaks stuff and Jennifer Connolly is kinda purty. And subtext? Sure, there's subtext. The cartoon monster is obviously a metaphor for... for... er, um, not to worry - Ang Lee hasn't quite figured that one out yet either. There was a day when this sort of junk culture came with a price tag of 25 cents and a warning from your parents that it would rot your mind. Chalk one up for your parents."
1,Horrible,"I saw this movie @ my cousin's and I thought it was gonna be so good. I love comic book movies so I was expecting something excellent. I thought this movie was a waste. It just totally sucked. I wouldn't buy this @ all. If you wanna see it, go out and rent it or borrow it. It's not worth spending your money on actually buying it"
4,Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno were a low budget Hulk.,I just bought the Hulk on blue ray and I gotta say this movie still rocks. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and the bad reviews this movie received is pretty comical even til this day. Its depressing knowing that majority of world's vision of the Hulk is Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno and is the reason this movie got such ridiculous reviews. I can't stop laughing when I read people's comments about the Hulk's jumping ability and how big he is because they didn't see that in the 80's tv series. This movie here is what the Hulk is really like in the comics. The 2008 Hulk was ok and people enjoyed that one more cause it resembled the 80's tv series but in no way was that better than Ang Lee's Hulk.
2,Ewwwww,"I tried REALLY hard to like this movie. Unfortunately my high hopes for a harrowing and exiciting film like X-Men or Spiderman was completely shattered when I first noticed the way of how they were directing, I instantly knew that i wasn't going to like it, their attempts for making a comic book style film failed...well for me at least. First off, Ang Lee i think tries WAY too hard to make movies with good storylines too big. Paycheck was a good movie, but he tried to make it way too emotional, instead he gets a two dimensional image of a good actor. Before i knew it, i wasn't watching an amazing film based off an amazing comic book character, i was watching an amazingly done special effects, two dimensional characters walking and talking to each other wondering what they should do about a giant 2-year-old thats running around destroying things."
2,Stop the Madness,"How many films of the 1990s and 00s can be reviewed in one sentence: The special effects were dazzling, but the plot and acting left something to be desired? If the 1970s were the height of the humanistic film (""Whose Life Is It Anyway?,"" ""Breaking Away,"" ""Testament,"" ""Harold and Maude,"" ""Ordinary People"") than 1990-2003 has to be its all-time low. So much current film is digital and excessively slick.Director Ang(st) Lee's attempt to inject the issues of child abuse and family dysfunction into its FX parade meets with clumsy results. ""Spiderman"" was far superior in fusing its dazzling visuals with the charisma of Kirsten Dunst and Tobey McGuire, but no actor in ""Hulk"" is terribly compelling in his or her role. ""Hulk"" vacillates between slow, sad, and baffling passages about Bruce Banner's secrets and upbringing and roid-ragingly impressive but oddly disconnected Hulk transformation and battle sequences. Eye-candy and ennui. Pass on this. Buy ""Spiderman"" instead."
1,Boring,Only movie that has has ever made me walk out of the theater. I hated it. Most boring movie involving super heroes from a comic ever made.
4,What's With You People?,"Even as a kid, BEFORE I started reading comics, I understood that the old Bixby/Ferrigno show was very different from the comic. Isn't it obvious that the Ferrigno Hulk was the way he was because CBS couldn't afford to have him fighting the army during the late 70's? This movie was based on the original source material and is a more accurate protrayal of the character.Not that I didn't enjoy the old T. V. show (it's still one of my favorites) but as another reviewer pointed out, this movie is NOT a remake of the T. V. show! Stop it! I think you should all read a few of the comic books (from the early 1980s by Mantlo and Buscema) and watch this movie again.As a major Hulk fan, I was very pleased with this film. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it would've been improved by adding more Hulk scenes (he's the very reason that I paid my money to see it, after all) and making the ending battle less abstract."
2,Not Sure What Went Wrong!!!,I actually thought that this movie would be good. The previews showed that it had great special effects. Again I was disappointed and realized yet again that special effects do not make a movie. At one point in the movie the Hulk is fighting a mutant poodle which might I add is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of. The problem I see with this film is the same problem I see with the other Marvel Comics movies being released recently. The story does not have a steady flow. The movie stops and goes and by the end I feel like I have movie whiplash. I don't recommend this film.
3,"Good story, flawed execution","I really wanted to really like this film. While some complain about the introduction, it was OK with me. What got to me the most was all the ""comic book layout"" scenes that kept popping up over and over and over and over. After a while, I just wanted to scream at the director. If there could be a version without those scenes, I'd definitely be interested in picking it up. Until then, it stays on the shelf."
5,"""Hulk destroy The Incredible Hulk""",This movie is so much better than the series IMHO. That's all I'm gonna say.Just watch it...make your own mind.
1,Hulk smash Ang Lee!,"This film is awful in every way. I was hoping it wouldn't be corny or cheesy, but it was so much worse. I'm sorry for anyone who has seen it."
3,So-so.....,"The only thing good about this movie were the fight scenes. Everything else was so-so. ""The Incredible Hulk"" was so much better!"
2,Ang Lee should have watched Spiderman first...........,"The CGI Hulk was very impressive, for the 18 minutes you got to see him during the 2 hr. 18 min. film. The movie explains pretty much nothing and gets more confusing as it goes. Constant picture-in-picture type scene splits make it even more confusing. Bad transitions between scenes dosen't help either. In a nut shell, no plot, confusing story and no ties to the original Hulk story. The only way I would reccommend you see this film is on DVD when you can pick the scenes with the Hulk in action and watch them to your delight."
3,Passes time,"We all know it is a no-no to do genetic experiments on people. And once again a scientist David Banner has to do it to himself. Now to compound the problem he passes a trait onto his offspring Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Add a little lab accident and et voila instant hulk.This is not the best integration of real, animation and CGI. Blu-ray can not mask the fact that this is mostly cartoon. Yet the story is told and you have fun watching. There is a father / son conflict and a misunderstood Hulk dismantles a lot of military equipment with extreme prejudice. This film does not try to follow the TV series and is not so dated. The only real drawback is that Jennifer Connelly is just too cute and you forget to keep track of the story line.Dark Water (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"
1,"Love this kind of movie, hated this one","Be SURE to rent this movie before spending any money on it. It's been a long time since I've really hated a comic-book type of movie, but this one was just awful. I hope, in a BIG way, that the split screen effects don't catch on in Hollywood. I found them distracting and annoying, and they didn't even make much sense. The sound on the DVD was strange, too. I turned my volume way up, but still could barely hear a lot of the dialog. The Hulk animation was so embarrassing. I wished for Lou Ferrigno many times. I did finish the movie, but just barely. Couldn't really care less how it ended."
2,Disapointing...,"To tell you the truth, I expected a LOT more from the Hulk.I thought SUPERMAN 4 was stupid! This didn't have any point atall and made no sense!Plus it had less than convincing anamation, a boring script andthey made the Hulk bounce through the desert like some wierdhelium-filled jackrabbit!Don't waste your money on this stupid movie!"
4,"""HULK"" WILL ALWAYS BE 1 OF THE BEST COMIC HEROS!!","**STOP ALL THE HATE WHEN COMES 2 THE HULK...** HE DOES WELL IN THE COMICS OR ON SCREEN!! *FROM THE BEGINNING ANG LEE HAS MADE IT SIGNIFICANT 2 SHOW THAT HULK IS NOT JUST A MONSTER, HE HAS A GENTLE SIDE ALSO!* I SPEAK 4 MYSELF & MANY OTHERS WHEN I WRITE THAT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE BRILLIANT!FROM THE START I STRONGLY FELT THAT ""ANG LEE"" WAS A GENIOUS 2 CREATE A MAN/D. BANNER THAT MORPHS INTO A MONSTER/HULK WHENEVER HE'S IN DEFFENSIVE MODE! **I ALWAYS IDENTIFIED WITH ""THE HULK"" BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL HAVE A SOME HULK IN US ALL!!** EVERYONE THAT I CAN THINK OF HAS AN ALTER EGO THAT PROTECTS THE DOCILE SIDE OF OUR DEPOSITION!2 ANG LEE JOB WELL DONE BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS KEPT IT 4 THE KIDS BUT ADULTS COULD RELATE 2 HIM AS WELL. I'LL CONTINUE 2 SUPPORT ANY HULK ENDEAVORS!"
5,The Summer Movie that will Own,"Ok, the Hulk. What can I say? Let me start off by saying that I waited a long time to see the Matrix 2. When I saw it, I was so happy. A 5 star movie! Then I saw the Hulk. Woah. [cue dram music] Never had I imagined moving making could be like that. Never had I even fathomed ever seeing a movie based on Science fiction so well done. I was astounded. This movie in the first 30 minutes made my top 10 list of movies of all time. I should commit myself to a mental institution saying these next words,""it was better than the Matrix Reloaded"". There I said it.You won't be dissapointed.Drama!Action!Plot!Suspense!Hulk!"
2,Hulk,"Hulk's trailer was really exciting and intense. Made you wanted to watch it. However, after watching the movie in the theatres, I decided that this movie is probably one of the top ten worst movies of the year. Hulk's green skin looks just like some paint splattered onto this towering model. Eric Bana was a great actor in the movie. It's just that the movie was bad so everyone assumes that the actors and actresses were bad. Don't spend money to buy the DVD or VHS. Pick another movie that's worthwhile to watch over and over again."
1,The Inflictable Bulk - I HATE YOU!,This definatly one of the worst movies in history. It is right up there with Jason X. But this movie is far worse. The movie is soooooo slow and long it makes me sick. There is nothing memorable about this movie whatsoever. Avoid at all costs.Not to mention this movie is already in the $4.88 bin at Bal-mart.That sums it all up right there.
1,Li Ann's newest present !!!,"first, i should appreciate the director of this movie, Li Ann.After awarding OSCAR prize, he continue his style, direct a movie that mixed any elements he can.When i saw this movie, the scene which gave me a deep impression is, Hulk feel angry and change his outside looking to a greeen monster, you may feel shocked by the direct tech that Li Ann who want to give you.Last, just like most people said, this movie is not bad, and I bagan to look forward Li Ann's next stuff^^"
1,Oh my God this is rank!,"Really awful beyond words. The most annoying camera split shots, a painfully S L O W start, middle and end, a hairstyle on Jennifer Connelly that made me want to grab a pair of scissors and cut off that terrible bang on the right side of her face, what more can I say? Except for a dozen minutes of fury in the 2 1/4 hour long film this is a huge waste.Stay far, far away."
2,Better Than Expected,"I took my grandson to see this and he loved it. I knew I was going to be in for 2 hours or so of ""hulking out"" and I wasn't disappointed. My beef is with the DVD. The picture quality of the copy we purchased looked more like a patchwork quilt and the sound quality was so low that I had to crank up the volume on the TV to hear it properly. Also, there was a sound that can only be described as film running through a projector.The second copy was better in that the picture quality was good but that sound was still there for most of the film.When you purchase this KEEP YOUR RECEIPT."
3,Gets in my way.,"But... I found if I put it between the E & B strings, it's not as bad. Right now it's sitting just above the tailpiece of my Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty III. I've not played since putting it there last night, so I don't know if it'll still be in the way or not."
5,Just what we needed!,"Me and two of my boys tinker with guitar. We lose picks like crazy. The Wedgie is genius! Tiny, almost invisible foam piece that attaches to the head strings. You just a few picks in and always have them available!We used them as stocking stuffers. Recommended!"
2,ok,"Not bad. it works Not much in the way of frills, but it's cheap! and amusing... The movie is a little less than believeable, but for pure cheese entertainment, you can't beat it...."
1,"Makes ""Twister"" look like fine art","No spoilers here - I completely lost interest 2/3 of the way through this movie and don't know or care how it ended.One-dimensional characters would have been an improvement; these were 50's-tech robots responding to punch-card commands. No personality, no motivation, no reason to care.Technical development was similarly non-existent.even tornadoes don't hit 400 mph wind speeds, so it would require at least a little exposition to suspend disbelief.""Twister"" may have its plot weaknesses and technical inaccuracies, but at least it's an enjoyable guilty pleasure. ""Storm Tracker"" isn't worth the trouble it takes to press ""Play"", let alone buy the disc.Skip it for something else - anything else."
1,It didn't even fit in the plug,"Bought this item and it didn't fit in my m675 plug as they pretend.It doesn't have the electrical cord, so If it had fit, I also would have to buy a electrical cord to use the adapter.This is crap."
3,Well made case,The case is well made and protects the nano quite well. The surface is textured but not hard to pull out of your pocket like some rubber/silicone cases. It also has a built-in plastic window to protect the screen. It does increase the nano thickness by about 75%. My only major complaint is that dust can work its way down from the cutout around the Hold switch to the screen and the rest of the IPOD. I still have to clean the screen/body periodically with this case.
2,A godawful American movie but an amusing French one,"As seen in theaters or on VHS, ""Alien Resurrection"" is almost unreleasably bad: cliched, nonsensical, witlessly crude - altogether a ...petering-out of a once great series.But when I received the DVD as a gift, I discovered that watching it with French-language audio and English subtitles - in effect, as a French film - was a completely different experience. It became an entertainingly light-hearted, ""The Fifth Element""-ish blend of science fiction and farce. Certainly not what Fox had in mind but you make the best of a bad situation."
4,TOTALY COOL!!!!!!!!,This ALIEN movie is a definite winner.The character of rippley is packed with attitude. WEAVER is finaly let loose to do what she allways does with a twist.rippley is no longer totaly human.SHES GOT A BUG UP HER A**!
4,Underrated.,"This film is hardly as bad as others claim. It has some of the best effects of the series, colorful and distinct characters, great performances (Michael Wincott, Ron Pearlman, Dan Hedaya, J.E. Freeman), memorable action scenes, some of the best lines since ALIENS, excellent musical score, and visually impressive cinematogrophy and sets. I especially like how the aliens are portrayed as living, thinking creatures rather than mindless killers like in the second and third films. The only thing that detracts from this spectacular sci-fi thriller is Weaver's completely flat and uninspired performance as the new Ripley. Overall, not as good as one or two, but just as good as three. The Alien series is still going strong."
3,Alien: The Next Generation,"The picture and sound quality on this DVD are excellent. The lack of features does not help, though, on what is definitely the weakest of the four films.I have seen Alien Resurrection a few times now and I find myself coming to the same conclusion. It is an interesting idea, but perhaps it tends to be a little too much like a comic strip. Nevertheless the film is quite good, only going off the rails in the last twenty minutes when Ripley meets the Alien Queen and then the Newborn arrives. Bad idea that should have been scrapped. The ending has to be the worst of all the movies.Nor am I sure what to make of this ambivalent Ripley.My hope is that, if there is an Alien 5, it should be the last one. I like the idea of a private expedition searching for and finding the alien planet of origin. Now that would be one to watch! Alien Origin anyone?"
1,The WORST movie in the world!,"This movie is an absolute peice of garbage! It is IMPOSSIBLE to swim underwater for 10 minutes! This is the most rediculous movie ever imagined! I probably wouldn't-couldn't watch this movie again if my LIFE depended on it! This movie isn't worthy of being called pond scum, it isn't worthy of being considered raw sewage! I have NEVER seen a movie WORSE than this in my LIFE! If it was possible, I would give this movie 0 stars! This movie is so utterely rediculous that I'm suprised it was ever even thought up! I sincerely hope you don't LIKE this movie at ALL!"
2,Summer Popcorn Flick,"Terrible compared to the other three. Randomly put in the hands of a Frenchman who had never directed a movie in English. Very odd for a foreigner to direct a sequel as his first movie in another language. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure his French movies are wonderful, (haven't seen them yet) but Fox was just not smart to pull this stunt and ruin the best Sci-Fi trilogy in history."
4,It's good (enough),"Was it better than the previous films? No, but it was watchable. I was disappointed that there was NO depth to the most of the characters. It wasn't until 2/3 of the way into the movie that we discover Call's background and finally see WHY Winona Ryder was cast in this film: to bring out some heart and suffering to Call's character--though we could of had some subtle hints early on that she was unique. All of the eye-rolling one-liners throughout the film were expected considering that Joss Whedon wrote the script. The film could have been so much better if only I was given a reason to care about the characters..."
3,A must have for the series,"You have to have this one to complete the set. It's not quite as good as the 1st or the 2nd, but neither was the 3rd. But if you want to complete the set, you gotta get it."
3,Okay I guess,"Better than the 3rd, but DEF not as good as Alien and Aliens. This was okay, I guess. Not good but not bad. I suggest renting this before buying. I have the Quadrilogy so it came with it :)"
4,Better than expected.,"I had poor expectations for this film after I watched, some time ago, Alien 3. However I must say that this movie still managed to scare me and keep me interested. Not as good as Alien 2, but better than 3. My only, small, complain is that after 200 years the technology hasn't progressed at all (perhaps, like Star Trek, human civilization has reached a state of high but static technological development). I believe that there is still life for a sequel to this series. In all four movies no explanation or reference of any kind was given regarding the alien ship and it's origin from where the eggs were found. Perhaps a sequel that will make some kind of contact with that alien specie so that some explanation can be given to what, why, where and when of the eggs. Overall: VERY GOOD."
3,The Worst of the Series,"This film was such a disapointment. The plot is lame, the cast is mostly unimpressive, and the newborn alien is the dumbest thing ever to hit the big screen. My biggest gripe about this film is that they try to often to be funny (and often fail miserabley)The little good that comes from this film is as follows. The aliens are rather impressive. We finally get the see how totally adaptive they are. The special effects are very good too, but all in all this is just a bad exscuse for an Alien movie"
1,Winona Ryder ruined it,"I can't help but think this film would have been received better had it not been for Winona Ryder and her horrid acting scarring this film. With a performance oddly reminiscent of her Heathers character, it just seemed out of place."
1,more like alien hybernation,"I remember when I saw this at the cinema. They made a mistake and accidentily started showing the movie ""Mouse Hunt"". I wish they allowed us to keep watching it because I am positive it would have been better.That is all I wish to say."
1,WHAT SOME PEOPLE WILL DO FOR MONEY,WHY O WHY O WHY ?THEY HAVE RUINED THE WHOLE SERIES NOW ! ! ! !I EMPLORE YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD !:( :( :( :(ONE WORD - JOBBIES
1,Save a Classic. Don't See This.,"There are movies in our life that we all think should have never been made. I thought Alien 3 was one of them until I saw this one. This is by far junk meant to cash in on a franchise that should have died with the original Ripley in the lead foundry at the end of Alien 3. Honestly folks, lets chat about how bad the concept was.The bad guy corporation was able to recover enough DNA from the burning lead to develop both a Ridley and an Alien. Okay whatever. Then pixie Ryder turns out to be a super android-great.There are so many ways that this sucks, and I think there is no finer pair of SCI FI movies outside Star War and Empire than Alien and Aliens. This movie just hurts to watch because you realize that once again Hollywood has to find someway to separate you from your money; don't fall pray. Go buy the first two. Curl up with you signifgant other and polish of a big bowl of popcorn. Buy those classics before you spoil them by seeing this film."
1,If only they had 0 stars,"First off, I would like it known that I am a hardcore Alien fan and as a fan I was thoroughly insulted by this fourth installment. every critic complains about Alien 3 but I enjoyed it immensely and it was obviously better than this swill. What I hated most about this sequel was the mutilation of the Aliens. They are what draws people to the films, they are completely menacing and terrifying. The one in Alien 3 personified this completely but in this one the Aliens are slow and hardly ever move! What was the meaning behind that (bad script, director are my answers). it is just sad watching this movie, because i was watching the whole franchise sink down the toilet. I do know that an Alien 5 is being written and has the go-ahead to be made and from what I heard about the script I think I'm better off watching my toilet function. So sad."
3,Huge dissapointment thanks to Joss Wheedon,"Jean-Pierre Jeuent is still a master even after this bomb. The problme with this movie isnt the directing or the acting...its the boring story. A 2 hours alien movie with about 4 alien encounters...no thanx. Its seems as if Joss just breezed throught the script and let it go. The scene were the Aliens escape is a prime example.....Aliens escape, Marines evacuate..scene over...Were's the battle were's the suspense..were are the aliens. A nice 20 minute aliens battle scene right there would have made the movie 50% better....oh yeah and the ""baby"" was a horrible idea that couldnt bee done any beter then it was."
2,Should have been kept a trilogy,"This movie isn't good enough to be called Alien.It adds nothing new to the trilogy.For example:The first one was like a horror with an alien taking the place of Jason and in outer space.Aliens was more like an action flick set in the future in outer space.Alien 3 tried to keep you on the edge of your seat wondering how they are going to kill the alien without weapons.And the third just uses ""Cloning"" as the excuse.I liked Jeunet's choice of colors though."
4,Better than expected.,"I thought this movie was not going to be as good as the previous ones (althought I did not like alien3 so much), however I have to say that the end result was better than I expected. The overall dark and large settings and a well fitted soundtrack togheter with a good cast and good overall plot well executed did produce an end result that I was very pleased with. This movie still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Overall: VERY GOOD"
1,How could anybody like this?,"This was long and boring and dull acting! I didn't even realize that Weaver was in this. That's too bad! She's a good actress too! Wasting talent on this! Ryder {stinks} even more in this then in Girl, Interupted. This movie was stupid, long and boring! Better then Aliens, but it {stunk}!"
2,Do French Directors Get Science Fiction?,"If you ask me, French directors should stay out of the SF genre. Like Fahreheit 451 (Francois Truffaut) and The Fifth Element, Alien Resurrection was a bit too 'artsy' for lack of a better word. I've seen these movie on cable and video. It appears they concentrated a lot on the scenery, but where was the story going?IMHO, they should have stopped at Aliens. It just gets tiresome to see these aliens, as gruesome as they are as unadulterated killing machines, striking terror in humans that blunder upon them.Anyway, that's my view."
3,Just another ok action movie,Well I havent seen any of the alien movies and this one was the first and it felt like an action movie It Has nothing to do with aline's Its even a Cheap Action movie The problem with this movie is the story and the script they were badwell i liked the orange color that was every where in the movie but the effects were bad realy bad i mean i felt like there were two kaind of aliens in this movie the ruber ones and the computer ones .. and why are the aline's head seams like a balloon full of yellow stuff !
4,Really good action thriller,"This is one of my favorite political action thrillers. In addition to the good cast (Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Brian Cox, etc.), the storyline is one which applies just as much today as it did 20 years ago, illustrating that greed and political expediency invariably seem to get the upper hand over real solutions. The film depicts a story wherein a clean, inexpensive alternative energy form is discovered -- but getting it out to the world for practical applications is the problem. Along the way there is lots of action, and good plot twists and turns. If you like this genre, you will enjoy this film."
4,Very plausible plot,"Morgan Freeman, Keanu Reeves, Brian Cox and Rachel Weisz. For any movie, this would be a star-studded cast. Yet for some reason, this movie did only OK at the box office, and had mediocre success upon video release. It should have done better. The movie's premise about CIA infiltration of a scientific collaboration is quite plausible. So is the existence of a huge, underground research facility which is the movie's setting over its last 30 minutes. The action sequences were also quite good, with some gunfights, some sabotage, and some explosions giving a good balance of special effects with a tad bit of suspense. The acting was also quite good, with Morgan Freeman putting in a believable job of portraying a part bad / part good guy. Keanu Reeves also comes across quite well. And Brian Cox excels as the pure bad guy who's fully committed to his cause in the movie's context. Overall, a good movie."
4,Best version,This movie was really improved by blue ray version. I would recommend buying it especailly if you don't have any version yet. I was never really that impressed with it but I like Keanu so I tried the blue ray and saw a new better movie.
5,An Absolute stunner!,"having only seen speed once i thought it was great till i saw this, the storyline was immense and we saw some excellent acting as always from morgan freeman, if you haven't seen this movie go out right now and buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
2,oh well,"Beautiful scenery in this documentary, but not much information. Was expecting something much better, given all the resources available on this subject. Wouldn't recommend it."
3,Least favorite in the series.,"This book, while containing good information, left me with an unclear understanding of how to interpret electional charts; it just didn't work for me. The first 5 volumes are outstanding, so this was very frustrating."
5,Strange people write good things,Bill let me read a draft of this book when it was fresh off the printer from his computer. It was a very touching and heartfelt book about the people and animals he loves. When I read it my senior year it was like the best book that I read that year and still is at the top of my list.
2,Title is very misleading...,"I picked up this book thinking it would include stories of people who called the psychic network. Yes, there were a few of these but most of the book centers around the author's personal life... something I was not interested in."
2,Inexpensive but noisy,"The first unit arrived with a dead right channel. Amazon did a great job shipping out a replacement and providing for return shipping! Super easy and no hassle, thanks Amazon!The replacement unit arrived quickly, in working order. I'm disappointed by the poor sound quality. As the other reviews note, it is noisy! There is a background static hum, that increases from channels 1 to 4. Channel 4 is annoyingly noisy.It is cheap and works well enough for a live/loud recording session, just don't expect that you will have the same quality sound that you would get from the mixing board or IO device."
5,A lot of useful information,This book is definitely not abstract. They give you a lot of great information you can start using right away. It's a comprehensive manual for better brain health.
5,High Energy and Big Talent,"I thought this movie was great! I think the actors were well suited to their roles. The musical numbers are terrific and they get stuck in your mind for days. All the actors showed their talents in areas beyond just acting. Of course, all the women commit a ""sure I did it, but can you blame me"" type crime. It's just a fun movie to watch. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
2,Great Acting Poor Musical,"Chicago had a great cast and they performed very well. However, I found the musical numbers to be lacking good catching tunes but rather flat melodies with no energy. I love musicals and I find most of them to be uplifting and cheerful with lots of energetic tunes. Chicago was to me a real let down."
4,Good buy,"The movie was fantastic on the big-screen, and the dvd is just as great for the wide-screen. Totally worth the purchase."
4,Best Picture and then some,"""Chicago"" is a musical 'satire', but nonetheless a musical set in the roaring twenties when times were understandably wild. Renee Zellweger plays a wannabe chorus girl that dreams life around her in terms of theatrical sets. She would not hurt a worm, but in an instant of artistic indifference discovers that although 'he' thinks he is alive 'she' thinks him dead. The murder that follows sets the theme for this genre.In its broadest sense, the film is about American innocence seen through the actions of the not-so-innocent, about life in times of murder, greed, and bedlam.The flick won 'best picture' award and rightly so. The acting talents of Catherine Zeta-Jones are extended by her song and dance talents as well.Worth the money."
2,Worst...,"I must voice the somewhat unpopular view that this movie is completely terrible. The characters are all despicable and their behaivor is not one bit piteous. I hated all the characters and felt the movie was a waste of time, i mean, yeah, the music and costumes are interesting, but they didn't exactly come up with that stuff all by themselves...this DID come right from a Broadway musical. Richard Gere is terrible, and Ms. Zellweger is forced down our throats. Terrible movie. See Moulin Rouge instead."
1,This won Oscars?,"This is little more than a filmed broadway show. When I go to Broadway I want to see a play/musical and when I see a movie I want to see a movie. Don't let the hype fool you, Zeta-Jones did not turn in an Oscar worthy performance and who chose Richard Gere? Gere is a great actor and a lousy singer. He was doing a bad Anthony Newly impersonation. Best Picture of the Year? This just opens the door for Hollywood to make more lame musicals."
1,What a snoozer!,"BORING! What a poor excuse for a musical. If you want to see a well made musical film, then by all means rent WEST SIDE STORY, GREASE or EVITA. Avoid this dreck at all costs!"
5,Chicago - The Movie - Outstanding!,"Having seen (and loved) two stage versions of Chicago, I was curious as to how it would transfer to the screen. It was MORE exciting, spectacular, and entertaining than I imagined. This is an EXCEPTIONAL film for anyone who enjoys musicals, Bob Fosse, dancing, and/or theater. I was most impressed by how creatively they moved from ""real"" to ""stage"" to insert the musical numbers, and by how visually stimulating they made some of the scenes. I was also surprised by how well Richard Gere held his own in the musical numbers and very impressed by the talent for singing and dancing of Catherine Zeta-Jones.A completely entertaining and enjoyable movie. I feel safe in recommending this to anyone."
5,All That Jazz and so much more!,Wow what a movie totally blew me away. The film just captivates you from beginning to end a truly great movie with fantastic music fantastic performances and production so high it makes Moulin Rouge look like a pantomine. A Must See
2,"lots of talent, but film is too dark and slow","First, I love all of the stars in this movie. Richard Gere (since American Gigolo), Renée Zellweger and Queen Latifa are all favorites of mine. I had never seen Catherine Zeta-Jones, but I was impressed with her talent, too. It was very cool to see them together in a musical because, other than QL, I had no idea that they all had song & dance type talent. So, for that reason, I guess that I am glad to have seen ""Chicago.""Despite the raw talent that was oozing from the screen, my discontent with this movie lies in two facts. It moves (way)too slowly, and it is VERY dark in both appearance and in subject matter. I even caught myself nodding off a few times.... I would not watch it again.If you want to see a gripping musical, watch Moulin Rouge."
2,Why Do People Like It????!!,"All right I didn't get it.I mean it's about wemon who kill their husbands and or lovers.I did like some of the songs and some of the acting ,but over all I didn't like it.Though I like the sound track.I though the movie was way bad."
5,"What were ""Daniel Wahl"" and ""A Viewer from Noneya"" thinking?","What were ""Daniel Wahl"" and ""A Viewer from Noneya"" thinking when they reviewed this movie? It's horrible to think that these two made the ""helpful review"" category because their reviews were dead wrong. There's no two ways about it! This musical is one of the best I have ever seen. Kander and Ebb craft a brilliant score, and it is only right that a musical by Kander and Ebb should be the first to win any academy awards for 30 some years, considering Kander and Ebb's ""Cabaret"" was the last one to win in 1972. And how can the earlier mentioned users even say things like that in the face of 6 ACADEMY AWARDS?"
4,Chicago,"I loved the movie Chicago and believe it earned every award it received. The acting was superb, as was the music. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. Chicago is a far better movie than Moulin Rouge in my opinion. I lasted about five minutes with Moulin Rouge and turned it off."
4,Blue Ray,I bought the blu ray version and it is good quality but not as crisp as a movie produced for Blue Ray
5,Simply the Best,"This is simply one of the very best movies to come down the pike in a very long time. The five principals do a phenomenal job of showcasing their multiple talents. And, yes, in spite of what some think, they all did their own singing and dancing...even Richard Gere. This is a ""must"" for any DVD collection."
5,I actually liked a musical!,I normally despise musicals but for some reason I liked this maybe because it's story was rauncy and not your typical musical I dunno it was just lot's of fun. Everything about it I enjoyed it has to be the first musical I ever liked. If you hate musicals you will probably like it like I did.
1,worst movie ever,"This movie was so awful it made no since. Everyone I was watching it with had no clue what was going on. We thought it would be better because we had watched Moulin Rouge and thought it was an awesome movie. We asumed with so many well known actors playing in the movie it couldn't be a dud but it was, so I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you were bored out of your mind."
1,Best Picture? Not a chance...,"This picture is obnoxious and unbearable to watch on the screen. Show tunes do not translate well to the screen if you're dealing with subpar actors who are not veteran Theater performers. Watching ""Singin' In The Rain"" or any old musical where people are actually singing and dancing with such talent and prestige, no cut-away shots to mask the fact that there is no way in heck the leads could do what they're trying to manipulate, is what I miss. Gere and Zeta-Jones and Zelleweger couldn't sing or dance to save their lives, but thanks to modern technology we can edit a movie so much to make this bombastic mess, which helps them appear to know how to perform in a play-sorry, no thanks. The fact that this picture somehow stole the Best Picture from Lord of the Rings (a true masterpiece) is beyond me and makes the Oscars a joke in my opinion. I couldn't stand this hyper-anxious-cynical take on our world and I don't know why others can. Remember, that's just my two cents."
2,Nothing special,"I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me. It is an entertainig and well executed movie, but not much beyond that. It sort of tricks you into thinking that its a good movie when really its quite flat. It has no message or theme, and you can't really come to care about the characters. 20 minutes after I had left the theater I had forgotten all about the movie, definitely a sign of a bad movie."
2,Deep Dish,"If you like ""show tunes"" and like 'dressing up' for your special someone, you will love Chicago.Ladies--if you have run out of ways to torture your husband, take him to this grueller of a chick flick--This will get even with him for that last ""golf outing"" he went on and came home with lipstick on his pants.This one makes 'Cats' look like a Schwarzeneger movie....Fred"
3,too much hype,"Its just a musical folks. I personally liked ""Moulin Rouge"" much better. There's just too much hype going on this movie, but I will admit that it was fun seeing Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renne Zellweger and Richard Gere in a musical. Is it the greatest movie ever made? No.There's just too much hype on this movie, and its not the greatest movie that I've ever seen. Oh well, to each his or her own."
2,Save your money!,"This DVD was a real disappointment. It failed on all levels. Musically, it was mostly deriviative, as a drama it was poorly motivated, failing even at being a send up of its own genre. It went on and on without developing interest or character, leaving this audience member bored and disinterested."
2,No singing please!!,"After watching Moulin Rouge and loving it I decided to rent Chicago. I had heard it was so good and won such and such awards, so I figured what the hey. Boy, was everyone wrong. I thought the actual story was very good, but the music was terrible! I don't even remember much of the story because when they would flip over to a musical scene I would lose interest and start daydreaming about all the other places I'd rather be. If they had cut the music I might've gave this movie 3 stars. And as for Renee Zelwegger and Katherine Zeta-Jones dancing together, (or at least they tried to pass it off as dancing) what was that (...)? They were barely even in synch with each other. And these were supposed to be professional dancers in a very popular show? Spare me. Lose the music and maybe we'll talk."
1,Chicago,Two thumbs down and one star for efort is my rating for the movie Chicago. There is nothing special in this movie that I have not seen in better musicals. This movie was a big dissapointment to me after I saw it in theaters.
5,A Wonderful Journey Back to Chicago in the 1920's,"Chicago is a wonderful movie. Though I usually prefer movies that date from the 1930's and 40's, this intruiged me. The musical scores are elaborate and sexy, and the story line always keeps you guessing. Zellweger plays Roxie Hart, a girl who dreams of becoming a star of the stage. However, when she murders her lover and is thrown into jail, her life is stalled. However, she soon finds a way in which she can get out of jail, with the help of a criminal lawyer-who always wins. Throughout the story, Roxie tries to twist her way out of jail while still trying to pursue her dream of starring on stage and bacoming famous. To find out what happens to Roxie, you'll just have to see the movie yourself. You will absolutly love Chicago."
1,Chicago -- piece of crap,"What a piece of crap that was!!! Mis-cast is the least of it's problems and among them and but not limited to are bad dancing, bad acting, bad singing ... er ... lip-sinking e.g. Richard Gere for one. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, Fosse would NOT be proud.As the two heroines in the film play the system Rob Marshall has played us . . . all for suckers."
1,TERRIFIC MOVIE!! TERRIBLE DVD!!,"Chicago is hands down my favorite movie. The anticipation of the DVD release came to a standstill last Friday. I opened the tacky case, put the ugly disc in the player, and was highly upset by the content. This is one POOR DVD!! ONE DELETED SCENE!?! ONE DOCUMENTARY!?! ONE DISC!?! COME ON!! Rob Marshall should have been brought on as director for the DVD release of his brilliant movie. Disney needs to step up to the plate with their DVD releases and take some cues from FOX or Universal."
2,Lousy attempt at a classic,"This should have been made in the days when Liza Minnelli was at her peak, can you just see (hear) her as Velma? They waited too long and as a result they are stuck with 'box-office hits' like Zeta Jones and Gere, both of whom may be good actors in their own right but are AWFUL in this travesty of a musical. And I'm surprised that Susan Stroman didn't do a better job of choreographing ""Cell Block Tango"", I was looking forward to that, but it was such a disappointment."
3,The legacy of the Gallego killings,"A well done book detailing the horrific killings that began in the late summer of 1978 and extending through December 22, 1980. Ten killings committed in a little over two years. Well-thought-out brutal, bloody murders, each one calculated to extract the greatest amount of emotional and physical torture before allowing death.The combination of the tiny, intelligent, beautiful, blond only-child beguiling and sociable and the thick, homely, uneducated man with the vacant eyes produced the perfect storm for terror.The questions that remain are many. Among those: Did Gerald Gallego and the Zodiac know each other and share victims?"
3,Steampunk dream,"Having recently discovered the joys of Steampunk, I ordered this with a bit of anticipation. Loved the tv series as a kid, and this was just as enjoyable."
1,The Gloss Is Off!,"Wil Smith lost an incredible amount of his Hollywood clout by starring in this stinker, loosely based on the highly entertaining television series of the same name. Kevin Kline is absolutely wasted in this schlock of a story as West's sidekick, Artemus Gordon. What the hell was Kenneth Branagh thinking by signing aboard to play the villain? And, lastly, the lovely Salma Hayek is virtually nonexistent in this thundering tale that makes less sense than any big budget spectacle to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years."
3,Surprisingly enjoyable,"After the roasting this received by the critics I was expecting a real turkey. But this is a surprisingly enjoyable romp. The script is snappy and unusually witty, Messrs. Smith and Kline seem to be having the time of their lives and Kenneth Branagh maste rs a southern accent to play the fiendish Mr. Loveless to great comic effect. Laughs abound, and there's enough action and cool effects to keep the youngsters happy, while the all-star cast adds extra sparkle and drop-dead gorge ous Selma Hayek provides female interest. Don't watch Wild West for its plot or realistic treatment of post Civil War USA. Wild Wild West is a rip-roaring action comedy - like a cross between Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and James Bond - and while it didn't win loads of Oscars I can think of plenty worse ways to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon with the family and a petrol-tanker-size popcorn."
4,sure it's silly,this is a silly movie but it is meant to be. not one thing in this movie is meant to be taken seriously. if you look at it as a serious movie then i am sure many will hate it. but if you see it just for some laughs and the effects then it can be watchable and fun. if you are a will smith fan you will more than likly enjoy it. i never saw the tv series from the 60's so i didn't have anything to base it against.
5,What's all the fuss about?,"This is a classic Smith/Sonnenfeld movie! What is everyone complaining about? I must say, I really liked this movie. It had the action and the thrills. Even a few turns! The only minus really is the fact that we didn't get to see enough of Salma Hayek.. But then again, is that possible? :)"
2,Such a waste of talent!,"Just saw WWW on dvd and am I glad I rented it. I could be more generous and give an added star due to its DVD content. It's quite a lot. But the biggest problem lies on the story. It goes nowhere. Its simple premise of Loveless trying to overthrow the US Government became so stale halfway that it seems Sonnenfeld decided to put a lot of action scenes (dull, by the way) to lengthen the film. Will Smith and Kevin Kline seems to try as hard as they can to cherish their parts but you can tell they know this movie's not going anywhere but down. The fx were incredible though, especially the giant mechanical spider. Problem is too much effects with no story can be compared to a book with a great cover but no substance. Kenneth Branagh as Loveless was pretty good but his talents, among others, were wasted due to an attempt to make a big summer blockbuster."
1,Winner of 7 Golden Raspberry Awards,...including worst screen couple & worst picture. Need I say more?
1,I would pull out my own eyes rather than watch it again.,Made me squirm that someone could have released it.
4,Wild Wild West,"This was the most enjoyable film I have ever seen. Not good. Enjoyable.I saw it recenetly on TV and I just sat there with a big grin from start to finish. It had style. OK, so it didn't make sense, but so what? I didn't expect it to be a faithful representation of 19th century life. It's just good fun: explosions, baddies, fun, and a huge giant evil metal spider, which counts for a lot in my book.This may not be everyone's thing, but if you don't want to be bogged down by useless extras like a plot, and get straight to the good stuff, Wild Wild West is for you."
3,Extremely Inventive!,"Will Smith, as the legendary Jim West, was a brilliant choice for this captivating remake. The special effects were exceptional and extremely inventive, but they did seem to go a bit overboard at times as did the entire plot. Kevin Kline, as Artemus Gordon, provides for some hilarious sidekick antics to West's straightforward but comedic demeanor. The DVD contains commentaries from the producer and director as well as a look behind the scenes into creation and mishaps of the production. After seeing all that went into the movie, I was able to appreciate it more. In true Warner Bros. Fashion, this movie watches more like a Bugs and Daffy cartoon than a Wild West Hollywood flick."
1,"""Remake"" ??","There is no point in ""remaking"" a show if nothing of the original is retained. Just make a new show. If you know your new version is lame enough that no one will want to see it unless you attach the name of a previous, more successful enterprise, maybe that's a hint to re-examine your new project.A lesson unfortunately necessary for much of Hollywood right now...."
4,WONDERFUL FILM,"JUST A FINE FILM, WITH A GREAT CASTE. NO OVERACTING, ESPECIALLY LIKED THE MUSIC. A FEEL GOOD MOVIE."
3,Enjoyable,This was an entertaining foreign movie. I think it it definitely worth watching. I forgot I was reading subtitles. It is a very touching movie.
1,my perceptions are not better than yrs...,"It seems to me This guy think he is the gods mind, he knows everything and stay all the time asking questions that he's supposed 2 answer, freedom and not slavery of ideas.Thanks"
4,The Encyclopedia of Medical Breakthroughs and Forbidden Treatments,"The Encyclopedia of Medical Breakthroughs and Forbidden Treatments .....Haven't read it yet but went to the website and found a good explanation of coveraqge..The bigger thing was, you can buy it there for $59.95 for both the softcover and ebook version!!!why pay over $100.00-225.00???The Encyclopedia of Medical Breakthroughs and Forbidden TreatmentsSoft Cover Edition and Electronic (eBook) Combo - $59.95Hope this helps. I know there are people out there looking for alternative protocols..This is a start.'nuff said.ChiliDogg"
5,ENJOYABLE +++,"This is a delightful DVD blending joy and fun with superb harmony, terrific lyrics and a clear presentation of the Good News of God's love for us all. It makes plain God's simple plan of salvation for all who will 'trust and obey.'"
5,Perfect fit,These floormats were a perfect fit. I was a little hesitant to by these because of the price but they exceeded my expectations in their quality and plushness. Very happy camper..
4,An emotional finale,"I felt that this movie was an appropriate and emotionally intense conclusion to one of the most sucessful live-action superhero television series of all time. Although some of the plot devices and story elements were decidedly corny, this was in keeping with the nature of the series, and therefore I do not feel it detracted from the film. In the meantime, the events leading up to David Banner's death were compelling and added a strong sense of tragedy to counterpoint the sense of liberation that David expressed with his final words. Finally, the closing sequence (particularly the final song, which segues into a particularly haunting rendition of 'Lonely Man', the closing theme to the television show) I found to be particularly moving and powerful, and it closed a fantastic voyage into contemporary fantasy with a poignent and much-deserved farewell."
1,this movie [stunk],"after the comparitvely brilliant ""trial of the incredible hulk"",this last hulk film pretty much failed miserably on every level. the storyline was muddled, with virtually no continuity from the series, hulk was underused, and the scenes he did have suffered from a lack of any real action. (it did look cool when he crashed thru all those walls during the first hulk out scene) also, this movie looks as if it were shot in a hurry, and cheaply... this and more happened to him on the series, and he survived without a scratch. after all banner had to endure during the course of the series run, be deserved better. he was beaten up, shot, attacked and or bitten by an assortment of woodland creatures, buried alive, burned, had heavy objects fall on him, and generally fell down alot..."
5,great classic,Ive always been a fan of the classic tv series. When the 5th season stopped it was pretty disappointing considering there were still episodes that weren't going to be aired. When they made 3 movies this movie put a conclusion on the tv series. Recommended for the die hard hulk fan.
4,I enjoyed reading this diary of long ago and far away.,"I originally found a copy of this book on a bookstore's sale rack and have have to replace it, I've reread it it so often. This collection of a Japanese ladys' notes and comments on her daily life and the people around her at the Imperial Court of a thousand years ago is fascinating. I found the translation very easy to read and I'm not very familiar with Japanese or Japanese history."
4,challenging,"I know very little of ritual Japanese life. I found it a challenging and thought provoking read. I had to bookmark the footnotes and was constantly referring to them. She's a highly intelligent woman, writing a very refined, very sensual story. I wish I was more aware of the nuances of Japanese court. It seems much of the meaning is between the lines. I've had to work hard to understand, and I still feel that i am digesting much of what was written. Very rewarding. Thank you."
2,Great story marred by poor Pitt acting,This is a great story that was poorly told in this movie. I felt like I was watching Brad Pitt in Tibet which is a testament to his poor acting skill. I really wanted to like this movie but was thoroughly disappointed. Even a soundtrack by Yo-Yo Ma could not save it. The directing was also distracting with poor pacing and choppy editing. I really wish this had been a great movie and I was rooting for it but it fell flat I am very sorry to say.
1,Read the book.,"Don't bother watching this. It is a poor recreation of a fantastic and sometimes unbelievable book. It's hard to believe this story is true; a man escapes a prison, wanders up into the mountains and becomes friends with the Dali Lama.I was so anxious to see this film, loving the book, and was so let down. It's quite boring.It's a hard book to bring to the screen anyway, so I would reccommend reading the book first. If you watch the film first, you're liable not to want to pick the book up at all, and that would be a shame as the story is wonderful."
2,seven years too long in tibet!,"pluses: great footage of tibetan landscape, great cinematography in general, some interest stuff about the dalai lamaminus (here goes!): brad pitt was TERRIBLE, couldn't do an austrian accent to save his life - i hate to say it, but arnold schwartzeneggar would have been better for the part; the story line, though interesting, was exceedingly shallow and hollywood, no depth whatsoever, ultimately quite dull; extremely grandiose and so sickly pro-western culture; and why couldn't they find a young tibetan for the dalai lama who didn't...have an indian accent. and i kept hoping someone would knock off brad pitt...and the movie would end."
2,Only for Brad Pitt fans,"This movie bears little relationship to the book, which is a narrative of one man's difficult struggle to exist under trying circumstances. The book is fascinating, and tells us much about life in Tibet. The movie, on the other hand, was transformed into a story about how Brad Pitt discovers meaning in life. At least I'm guessing that was the theme, because I quit watching after an hour. Brad Pitt's voyage of discovery entertains little, and informs not at all. The one plus is that the scenery is spectacular."
5,Great Movie Made Outstanding by Blu-Ray,I've seen this movie in the past and always found it interesting on many different levels so when I found out it was coming out on Blu-Ray I quickly purchased it. From the first panoramic scenes the detail and clarity is simply amazing. Anyone remotely interested in this movie should buy this. Another great example of why High Def on Blu-Ray is a whole other experience.
2,Oh please! This movie wasn't very good at all,"I'm writing this review mainly to tell everyone who isn't in love with Brad Pitt that this movie was good at all. I felt as if I'd spent seven years somewhere during this movie, seven years somewhere boring. The movie had about as much plot as pigs have wings. The movie centers around Brad Pitt's character who is neither likable or really that interesting. His relationship with the Dalai Lama in this movie which was originally what the studios used to sell this movie is barely a sideline. The movie was so bad that Battlefeild Earth looks like Star Wars in comparison. I hope all you ladies out there won't drop your ... to see yet another Brad Pitt washout. If you REALLY want to see Brad Pitt by Legends of the Fall or Fight Club now those two movies were excellent."
2,Boring and Stupid Plot,I guess this movie is only for die hard Brad Pitt Fans. Yes the scenery is great but the story is very shallow. And it's very long also.
5,GREAT WORSHIP AND PRIASE ON ONE DISC IN MODERN FORM,I am alway looking for great Christian Music at a good price. The add pleasure of the excellent condition was like my cup over flowed. very Blest
4,"good information is in there, but read with caution","I appreciate the information in this book. I think that it is good to let people know about the details and challenges in the garment industry. Her tone, some people described it as negative but it works for me in that tough love way. Then I was dumbfounded when I got to the chapters explaining how to sell your work. She basically states that a designer shall not sell their own products, hire a sales rep and pay them a commission of 85%. This would send my company broke fast! As an entrepreneur designer myself, I find her chapters about workflow and pattern development very helpful. Everything else I recommend one read with caution and exercise you fact checking muscles."
2,Defective Product,This Fuel Pump is Defective! When it was first installed it would show full then go stright down to empty even though there was fuel in the tank. Now it doesn't show the level at any time. My recomendation is to pay full price for the fuel pump and be able to see how much fuel is in the tank. Now I have to purchase another fuel pump and pay for the installation labor again. I only saved $50 on the purchase price by getting this defective Fuel Pump. When you factor in the cost of labor and the cost of a working fuel pump with a working gas tank level indicator that $50 savings ends up costing about $400! It does pump fuel properly though
1,Horrible Sequel to a great series,When released Hellraiser: Bloodline was the worst sequel in the series and one of the worst horror seqels to date. From watching the film one can tell about the studio cuts etc. Kevin Yager's cut wass supposed to be good and goes more into depth about Pinhead's story. Avoid this one at all costs.
1,A sloppy failure...,"Pinhead and the mysterious cube are back, this time in the future. We learn the origin of the mysterious cube through a series of flashbacks that have little impact on the overall story and are done in a flat, often boring tone that leaves the viewer wishing for something scary to happen. Scary? No. Gory? Yes. Too gory. This film packs on the excess gore and ignores everything else. But there is a time when gore is scary and a time where gore is pointless. This is the latter. It also marks the ""death"" of Pinhead but he makes another appearence in the fifth and upcoming sixth entries. The fifth, ""Inferno,"" does not follow the others, yet it is the best of the series. So far, ""Bloodline"" is the worst."
3,3 1/2- Better Than Hell On Earth,"Bloodline had what the previous film did not, an interesting story! It was really cool to see the beginnings of the box and the how and why it was made. I think that if the movie had focused on those early years and the future, skipping ""present day"" 1996, it would have been a lot better. There just wasn't much to the middle of the story that had to be really said or really needed. Besides that, I really liked the movie. The only thing about the ending that I didn't like was how it just ended with no real epilogue. Overall, pretty good."
1,Not a scientific book,"I have read this book. The author seems to lack of experience. Although the author has experience in the developing country for many years, but the contents of the book are not a scientific writen. I hope he can improve and write better than that.Thanks"
5,"Onkyo RI Dock for iPod is a ""must have"" for home entertainment","This product is simple to install, simple to use and offers tremendous functionality to my use of both the iPod and the home theater system. Having most of my music on the iPod means that my family can now take full advantage of the iPod's playlists and hierarchichal database (you can find what you want -- and quickly!).I'm absolutely thrilled with this purchase and believe that it is a must have for any iPod user's home entertainment system."
5,in honor of my great-greatpa,"first and formost a big thanks to john hayward,for bringing me closer to my greatgreatgrandpa.trails of trying to do his part to keep this country together.instead of seperated.i love this book.its lets me walk beside him as he battles from one place to another.my greatpa was wounded in the battle of fair oaks va.and also in williamsburg,va.he made it though all that to later in his early 40s to come back to va and marry my grandma.and have about 7 more children he was a widow with one son he brought done to va.it meant a lot for me to get this book and i highly recomend it to any one that loves true telling ofhistory between our states.i love you grandpa,and all of the soldiers of the 7th and to all the rest of the ones that did all they could to keep us together and not divided i salute youll."
4,Visually Stunning,"The story of Frida Kahlo is told with little dialog and mostly vivid scenes of events in her life. It is a biography, but creatively uses her work to tell the story of her tragically short life. Of course, as an art film, it has nothing in the way of suspense or action - but I also read the book. Its the kind of movie that you need to watch more than once. For anyone interested in Frida's work, I highly recommend it."
3,"Pretty good acting, way too long though","Salma Hayek's resemblance to Frida Kahlo in this film was uncanny! She looked just like her, and did a great acting job. The cinematography was gorgeous, and the movie stayed very true to Frida's life. In fact, a little too true. I feel that this movie tried way to hard to make sure that everyone new Frida's ENTIRE life story. I don't think that we needed all that. There were about a 20 scenes that could have been cut out and it wouldn't have taken anything away from the movie. And what was with the gratuitous sex? Dont' get me wrong, I have no complaints there. But after Frida is crippled and old, randomly they cut to a lesbian scene with her and some stranger. What the hell? Anyway, see the movie if you know who the real Kahlo is and appreciate good cinematoghraphy. It can be kind of a bore if your not an artsy person."
1,NOT A GOOD MOVIE,"Me as a Mexican it's awful to see how a mediocre mexican actrees tries to represent the lofe of one of the greatest painters in Mexico. When I saw the movie I saw Salma playing Salma not Salma playing Frida. Also the story it's awful, I saw some comments comming from Diegos daighter and she says that she hates this movie because it's not the true.Don't watse your time and money buying this DVD, if you want search for ""Frida, Naturaleza viva"" or "" Frida, lived life"" with Ofelia Medina that's a great movie and a real one."
5,"Frida the Artist, Revolutionary and ""Real"" person!","This was truly a remarkable movie for me. Loved it and each time I watch it I learn a little more about ""human nature"". Selma was magnificent in this movie.Based on a real life character and her ambitions.... ""not"" to give up and to be her own person. I loved this movie, but some may not approve of all the subject matter. Recommended for open-minded viewer."
5,Frida,"I did not know much about Frida Kahlo, so I decided to watch this movie. I did not have much of an opinion of her; her body or work was okay, she wore long, traditional Mexican dresses and she had been married to Diego Rivera. The movie did a good job of depicting her story in a way I could understand. Now when I think of her artwork I know to look a little deeper and can better interpret her emotions. The miscarriage explains a lot. It is also interesting to see the development of political ideas and the passion that comes with it. The exposure to another culture in helpful, in this ever smaller world we live in."
5,"Beautiful, Powerful, and Informative","The look and feel of this film transports viewers back in time to the Mexico of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Costumes, set design, and music intertwine with fabulous performances to tell a cohesive story that will make you lose track of time. I am sad each time it ends."
5,Outstanding,"Is this an accurate depiction of Frida's life? I have no idea, and I don't care. This movie is an intelligent, interesting, and beautiful piece of art in its own right."
5,Visual Delight,"Very artistically created, a visual feast, the film is a delightful work of art. And Salma Hayek's portrayal is enchanting."
5,¡Excelente!,My advanced Arte & Film Spanish class was assigned this movie even though it is in English. Frida is my favorite painter so it was no chore at all. I loved the movie and thought Salma was wonderful in that she was able to portray Frida from a young girl to her death.
2,Too many items missing,"I just spent 1.5 hrs entering 80 items. Only half of my donated items were included in the ItsDeductible database. I had to manually enter the other half and estimate the value on my own.Even with items such as clothes, I had to just pick an item from the database. It was rare that my donated item actually matched something in the database.This software is not the cure-all that Intuit says it is. I should've saved my money and entered all of my donations in a spreadsheet like I did in previous years."
4,Cheap but OK,"Don't get the impression that this is a first quality tool. You get what you pay for. It is effective and works as advertised. On my tool, the graduations were difficult to read because of cosmetic manufacturing flaws. For the price, it can't be beat. Aside from the cosmetic flaws that interfered with reading the scale, setting it was very easy and although I didn't calibrate it versus a known value, it seemed to be at least close to the value indicated. For someone looking for critical precision on a reproducible level, I would recommend one of the higher priced options. For someone needing a tool for a noncritical application or infrequent usage this one will work fine without damaging the wallet."
3,Not An Inch-Pound!!!,"Haven't had a chance to use it yet, however it's calibrated in Newton-Meters! You'll need a conversion chart or something else to convert to inch-pounds."
4,It fit!,"This product was a perfect fit for a director's chair I purchased as a Christmas gift. Although, the actual color is a lot lighter than the photo shows. Otherwise, it was a great quality product, and the gift was a success."
3,Canvas Seat replacement,"I bought this canvas seat because the price was right....or so it seems. They charged 9 dollars for the cover - fair enough. I bought two. They charged me double the shipping costs, but I didn't find this out until AFTER I received the item. The charges for shipping were not on my original receipt - only the one that came in the box. Also, the charge for shipping should have been 5 dollars, but since I bought two, they charged me double. It probably cost a total of 2 dollars to ship the item. I had two chairs that needed replacement and the cover didn't fit one of them. I went out and bought canvas at JoAnne's fabric and was able to make a replacement for about three dollars and it took about fifteen minutes. If you could buy the cover for 9 dollars and no shipping costs it is worth it. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,There are better places to get director chair covers,"I wouldn't bother with these people again . Their description of the seat cover is minimal. There are flat stick and round stick seat covers. They know that. I didn't. Their sort of salesmanship relies on the customer not wanting to return an unusable because the total shipping cost equals the cost of the item. On the principle of the thing, I wound up returning this item as it was useless to me and even got dinged by being charged sales tax on the shipping to me which, of course, they also don't refund. Get your covers at Everywhere Chair. Their descriptions are accurate and they give shipping options too. My shipping box was weighed down by their heavy catalog which I never asked for, boosting the weight of the package to a bit over 3 pounds."
2,"Good movie, lousy dvd","I must like the movie; this is the second DVD of it I've bought. But this disc, like the first (though from a different seller) is defective. Damaged areas mean big jumps in the DVD, whole scenes are unwatchable. Too bad."
1,Junk Junk Junk Junk,This has to be one of the worst PDA's on the market. It is all style over substance. I own two of these PDAs and none of them charge at all... They are completely dead. I was able to resurrect them once by hooking them up to an external power supply that I wired up the battery leads. It seems that these machine are programmed to fail after a year. The battery's that came with these PDA as still putting out adequate voltage and are perfectly fine. To bad that PDA is not. Word to the wise - DO NOT BUY THIS PDA!
3,Beware of battery problems,"Although I agree that the IPAQ looks great, has a great display, tons of neat applications, I've had a fatal flaw in my unit that doesn't appear to be that uncommon - the unit (even though completely turned off) drains the battery down to 0% at random times. One day it is at 95% battery capacity, the next day it's completely dead. That means you lose all your data and installed programs. Just wonderful if you're on the road, and used it to schedule appointments, etc (they're all gone, unless you were able to sync with a desktop/laptop before the battery died). I'm not claiming this happens with all units, but it does appear to be a significant problem - check out the links included below from the HP support site. After sending the unit back several times to HP, I'm tired of trying to get them to fix it. I'm trying to get HP to replace it, time will tell if they do...."
4,Increasing power charge time,"For those of you experiencing problems with sustaining a power charge... I had the same problem and my iPAQ only held a charge for a few hours, I was always losing data and eventually stopped using the device. I was ready to throw it out and I put it away for serveral months. I decided to give it another try and discovered that by adjusting the ""Standby"" setting (found under Settings, Power, then click Standby tab) the device now holds a charge for several days depending on usage. The ""Standby"" setting was set at 100 and I brought that setting down to 25. Give it a try before you give up on your iPAQ!"
2,It is what it is...,"I saw this years ago and if you are into witch-kitch, then this is for you. It's like pagan B grade sci-fi without the sci, so B grade witch-fi.It's well worth the price and a decent movie for pagans to own."
4,Pickin' Man,"Before the blues began to dominate the black Southern country music scene there was a transition period where the previously dominant ragtime commingled with the emerging blues picking sound. That is where Blind Blake comes into view. This CD shows off his masterly picking style but also shows that he gets the new blues country beat, as well. This CD has liner notes that are very informative (as are most Yahoo liner notes) about these evolutionary moves. As to the music highlights here are Southern Rag, Hard Pushing Papa, Sweet Papa Low Down and a classic rendition of Rope Stretching Blues (with the classic anti-death penalty line 'in a couple of days I will not be singing this song'). Get this if you need a nice clean country blues pick."
4,Lots of good information but cumbersome to use,"There is a wealth of information in this book but if you want to refer to it only occasionally as various health situations arise in your family it is difficult to quickly find a remedy or discussion of any particular ailment. This is because of the way the book is organized. If you're willing to sit down with the book and patiently go through the index, however, you will find valuable information. I have seen Mr. Santillo speak (at a Juiceman ""rally""!) and he is quite dynamic and convincing. Very impressive."
4,Ever After - a look at a beautiful time period,"Ever After, a movie with an intruiging plot and stunning costumes. Unfortunately, hardly any music throughout. The theme song, 'The Mummers' Dance' by artist Loreena McKennitt is truley a gem, and it's a shame that it wasn't played during the movie."
5,My all-time favorite Movie,"Not seeing this movie is literally a sin! Barrymore, Huston, and Scott captivate, charm, and bewitch every audience member! See this movie: rent it, buy it, act it out at home! This enchanting tale is a certain must-see!"
5,great movie,"I love this movie. The actors/actresses chosen for the roles in the movie are perfect, seeing Richard O'Brien in a recent film, I was half expecting him to start the Time Warp! The new adaptation of the fairy tale Cinderella is not as shocking as the Romeo and Juliet film with DiCaprio but this film with Barrymore was softer, kinder and much more romantic. Angelica Huston portrayed the wicked stepmother perfectly and the one sister, Margaret, was the best portrayal of a ratty stepsister, competely mean! I would recommend purchase of this film if you like romance/comedy movies. If you liked ""Never been Kissed"" then you will love this film. I would place it in the same category as ""The Princess Bride, Never Been Kissed and The truth about Cats and Dogs"" the whole rags-to-riches-finding-prince-charming thing!"
5,The best Cinderella story ever.,Drew Barrymore is the perfect Cinderella. This movie is a whole lot better than the cartoons and other versions. It is my favorite movie by far.
3,Ever After: Cinderella Story,Good movie however I was hoping to transfer it to my Mp3 player but was unable to. Bummer. Now the movie sits on my computer taking up precisious space. Just becase Amazons states you can transfer the movie onto a portable devise does not necessarily mean you can transfer it to yours. I was unble to transfer it to my newly acquired Ipod touch.
3,a wonderful movie to watch with everyone,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I guess I fell in love with it right away. Sure it airs again on television, but I always catch it somewhere towards the middle or the end. Ruins the whole feel of a good movie.That's why I'm going to get this movie on DVD as soon as I save enough money for it. When you do order this movie, I strongly suggest you get the family together, and sit down with a big bowl of popcorn, and lots of soda. I know after you watch this, you forget all the troubles you've had that day, and remember how Danielle found love at long last."
5,The most wonderful movie ever made,"Ever After is by far the best movie ever made. Period. This movie grabs you right away with its real-life story line. This is a movie that could have really happened. Drew Barrymores's character is the person we all dream of being able to be. And of course Dougray Scott is to die for. But the best part about it I think is the absence of vulgarity. And yet it is such a compelling plot that anyone young or old, male or female will be able to appreciate this film. It is clean but definitely not dull. Just a personal note: Being an avid horse-lover and rider I fell in love with the horses in this film. Not only are they gorgeous, but they are handled and ridden so well which can be a rarity in movies. All in all, this movie is absolutely perfect! You must see it if you haven't!!!!!!!"
5,A winner,Awonderful movie. Its a modern interpretation of cinderella and a very good role model for young girls. I was pleasantly surprise that she was quite resourceful and totally different from the traditional Cinderella. Instead of the victim she was very independent and resourceful. A good movie for young girls to see. I loved Drew Barrimores interpretation.
5,"Awesome, beautiful, wonderful movie!","I have probably seen this film at least 10 times. I may be a tad biased, though, because I LOVE Drew Barrymore. She is the best actress in the world, as far as I'm concerned. She does a brilliant job in this movie, and everything about it is just so romantic and touching. Prince Henry is the most charming prince I've ever seen in any film, and he's easy on the eyes for the women out there.I highly recommend this film to anyone, but especially girls and women across the globe. It's a ""chick flick"" but has a wonderful story behind it (Cinderella with strength, wit and ultimate beauty)."
5,A joy to watch and share with good friends.,"This is a movie I have seen with my daughter and will in the future see it time and again with my grand-daughters. It is timeless, romantic, funny, and all this with a human twist. It makes a person believe in dreams again."
5,"this movie is so cool, plus it shows a bit of action also:)","when i saw this movie it was so funny because when the step sister with the blond hair got punched it was so awesome, i rate this with 5 stars because my family including my younger sisters saw this and they thought the movie was great also my favorite actress happens to be drew barrymore so if you havent seen this movie try it you might like it, sam i am:)"
5,Perfectly Charming,"I really loved this movie, it made me laugh and cry and go see it for a second time! Drew Barrymore was such a kick-butt Cinderella (literally). I especially loved the music. I am definatley buying this video! This movie makes you believe that fairy tales do come true!"
4,Powerful Cliche,"This film was a truly well done piece of art, evoking the fairytale essence and emotions that only Cinderella has the ability to render. In short, it basically rocked. Although it was completely predictable and a total cliche, the film still manages to touch the audience in a unique yet heartfelt manner. This movie is perfect for the hopeless romanic in all of us!"
4,It's not bad,"I bought this because of Anjelica Huston. I thought is was going to be really stupid, as it is cinderalla, but it was kind of funny. Anjelica is wicked and sexy and adds some laughs."
4,Fulfilling the Prophecy,"After more than a decade of exile from the floating islands, Terrel can at last return home to fulfill his promise to Alyssa. However, his failure to heal the last maddended Ancient has weakened her protection as a Sleeper, and the foretold lunar conjunction is happening much sooner than expected. Can he reach Tindaya in time, and can he fulfill the prophecy despite his failures?"
1,Full of mistakes,"The book is full of mistakes and quite odd phrases. As a native speaker of Turkish (I teach Turkish, thus I have the book) I find the dialogues and passages artificial. Some idioms and phrases are used out of place and depending on the context the learner may choose to use them, they may result in embarrasment on the part of the speaker and/or hearer.In terms of the organization of a language teaching/learning book, like many other non-English teaching books, it does not follow the criteria for a good book; such as presenting the subject matter clearly and in an organized way so that it is not confusing for the learner. The exercises are usually controlled, which is not a very good thing.All in all, it fails in three important aspects: The correct use of the language and grammar, the authentic use of them, and the organization of the material.I hope there are better alternatives around. This certainly doesn't qualify as a good one."
5,My Kids Love It!!!,We love Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and what better way to eat than to have it in Spiderman shapes. My kids beg for this every day.
4,Review of First World War,"This is probably on a par with anything written by Barbara Tuchman. I learned new things about the war and its aftermath (1918 to 1921) that I had never known, especially because of the author's attention to detail on more than just the Western or Eastern fronts. Although it's detailed (nearing Kevin Philips quality), it's very readable. It would have benefited from the judicious use of more battlefield maps, especially for the typical American ignorant of the local geography of Flanders.Nevertheless, this is a very pertinent book today for the world in which we live. Incidentally, if the description of the English losses at the Somme doesn't bring a tear to your eye, the only generous interpretation is that you missed that section. A small criticism is that the author spends more time than needed foreshadowing the calamity of WWII and not enough exploring the circumstances leading to WWI."
2,Let down by lack of maps,"Leaving aside Keegan's leaden prose style, the major problem I have with this (original hardcopy edition, 1998) is the of the lack of maps. Because of this I got no further than the chapter dealing with the Battle of the Frontiers and the Marne. It's very frustrating to be told in great detail about army movements without being able to see a pictorial representation. It's meaningless (and dull) to be told how X Division moved from town A to town B, failed to caputure town C, lost control of town D and then was forced back to river E without being able to see where they are. This is typical of the level of description, and yet there are only 10 maps in a book of 450 pages. All in all it makes for a dull and monotonous read."
2,dissapointed,"This book misses its point. It's written in a novel style rather then in style of documentary prose like it should be. There is also a lack of exact informations and I expected more maps, more dates, names, weapon-types...At some spots a little bit confusing too."
3,hard to figure out without maps.,"John Keegan is usually good with his books but somehow he forgot one important thing that should be in history books, maps. Without them it's confusing to read since you have no idea where the battles are based most of the time. The Second World War had maps on almost every page so it was easier to understand where on the continent battles were fought. So unless you know your geography skip it."
2,Review Addendum,"I reviewed this book previously and did not like it (see below). I just finished a competing volume, The Great War, by Spencer C. Tucker. The Tucker book is half as long and superior in all respects to Keegan's book. Readers searching for a good introduction to WWI should go to Tucker's book."
3,A bit dry.,"If you are looking for a book that tells you the names and positions of every platoon that served in the Great War, how they moved, where the battles were fought and the terrain (there is so much about the soggy terrain in Flanders) etc., this is the book for you. It almost seems to have been written as a text book for classes on the history of military strategy. One warning - get yourself a good atlas - the maps in the book are worthless, which is a shame because the author is so specific about locations. If you are not interested in all of those details, do not buy this book. If you want to explore the social, political and military effects of the war, and learn what the life of a World War I soldier was like there is a great set of lectures in the Great Courses Series on the War. It is a bit pricy, but worth it. Of course there is also All Quiet on the Western Front - a masterpiece."
2,Detail juxtaposed with generalization,"Hoping this would be a good, one volume overview of the war, I was greatly disappointed. The explanation for the outbreak, especially Russia's role, was oversimplified and in error, especially regarding Russian mobilization options.Despite some detailed explanation of various campaigns, the treatment of the East (which was critical to the outcome of the war) struck me as a bit superficial.I'm still waiting for ""the"" WWI survey history."
2,The writing is flat and there are way too few maps.,"When I bought ""The First World War"" by John Keegan, I was looking forward to a my first comprehensive military history of World War I. I was disappointed and I wonder why the reviews have been so glowing. The first months of the war are desperate maneuvers by both sides to encircle and avoid encirclement. But trying to follow Keegan's description with the sorry minimum of maps, I was constantly frustrated. The key battles have no maps whatsoever. There's just a few summary maps. Keegan's descriptive style is as flat as the terrain of Ypres. I'm struggling to stay with the book. Arrgh. If you want to read a really good book about the initial stages of World War I, read Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August""."
2,Disappointed,"I have no doubt that Keegan is an authority on this subject. I felt that he failed to realise that readers may not have his encyclopedic knowledge of the First World War. There are constant references to battles and troop movements but no supporting maps & diagrams, the result was that the subject failed to come alive and I couldn't really get involved in the book.This is a shame as Keegan is an excellent journalist and makes his points clearly and quickly in the medium of the newspaper."
4,"Very good , but hard to know if the film is taking advatange","This film divides people's opinions .I don't know if the director hates the main character or feels sorry for him - could be both .I suppose it shouldn't matter as this is only a film , but it really affected me .The film leaves a lot unsaid .The final shot leaves the viewer further confused , I felt .This could be the reason why there are over 300 used copies of this film as I write this review .Jack Nicholson is playing against type , but is playing his age , which is interesting . His performance is why this film is so powerful . It is often uncomfortable to watch and maybe audiences cannot 'handle the truth' , to rip off one of Jack's lines from another film .It is worth a viewing , but you may find it unsettling ."
1,"Horrible, depressing movie.","There is no justification for 1 star for this movie. I feel cheated not so much for the money but for the time I wasted watching the movie. I kept on waiting to see the ""blisteringly funny"" part some critics described it as. Not only the movie is not funny, it is depressing, slow, and life discouraging."
1,It's about 2 hours longer than it should be,"I like Jack and his performance is quote good. However, that is not enough to save this bland, dull movie. In my view it is about 2 hours longer than it should be. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Very Weak and Uneventful..,Jack has done alot of great movies but this is definately the WORST one I've ever seen...Don't waste your time on this one.
2,Why did they make it?,"...It is the most depressing movie I ever saw in my entire life. I am not very young, so I don't find it funny. I do see a lot of people similar to the main character who never figured it out... It is not funny at all, from my perspective. It is scary and depressing, because it is too real, if you come to think about it. The emptiness of existence. It was pictured with obvious talent. Maybe, it makes sense, so more people can realize who they really are? I wish they also point out at some re-aasuring optimistic direction though."
5,This is a great funny movie. Go out an buy it.,"I don't know why you people don't think that this is not a good movie. If you are not involved in Childreach, than you didn't get the story.I am diffently going to buy the DVD without your bad reviews on this movie.This is an excellent movie.It has humor and a good movie for a change than the recent movies that have been out.The recent movies have be all out have stink so bad.So go out and buy this movie."
1,AWFUL!!!,"This was the most depressing, miserable, boring movie. The music overpowers the narrative. The story line is long and boring and DEPRESSING. I realize that some movies are sad, but this movie was incredibly boring. I'll give it this much, it is realistic. BUT who wants realistically boring and depressing when watching a movie. I could have watched paint dry at a nursing home and been more entertained."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"If you're buying this DVD thinking that it is going to be one hilarous movie, you better think twice. The movie is about Warren Schmidt, a guy who was just forced into retirement and lost his wife of 42 years. He goes on a road trip and continues to write to his foster child about all his problems and (mis)adventures, while trying to kill time before going to his daughters wedding.The acting by Jack Nicholson is superb. Jack plays Warren Schmidt very well, but the movie tends to lean to boredom. The movie does have a couple of comical moments in it, but nothing that you will actually fall over laughing your head off at. This movie goes more as a drama than a comedy. I give this movie 3 stars, because Nicholson does do a brillant acting job, but the script was not very interesting at all. The good comedy parts are probably within the first 20 minutes and then the rest of the movie you are left saying ""when is this freakin thing going to end."""
2,Just Plain Ol' Boring,"Warren Schmidt is a retired man in his 60s, who decides to `change his life' after his wife (a wonderful June Squibb) dies. About Schmidt is one of the year's most disappointing, overrated films. It's not a bad movie per se, but it's flaws outweigh it's good things. The film is slow and sluggish (not to mention overlong) to an almost excruciating level, and although the acting is good, most especially by the quirky Kathy Bates as Roberta, the movie is flat and dull. Perhaps what makes this so tedious is the fact that Warren Schmidt (what a TERRIBLE name) is such an uninteresting, monotonous character. We have absolutely no reason to care for Schmidt (or his inert life). As one critic noted, `it's a boring movie about a boring man'. About Schmidt was penned and directed by Alexander Payne, who also brought us the exceptional Election. Despite one or two neat observations (and a touching finale), Payne brings us nothing sharp, audacious, or funny as Election. What a pity..."
1,Most overrated film of the last decade,"election was not the best film ever, but it did show alot of promise for new commer alex Payne. But his follow up was nothing short of an absolute mess! Nothing gelled in this lazy, boring and deeply depressing film."
4,Neuroinformatic book for USM Master/Phd neuroscience program,A very good book which gives an idea to new students who are interested in this field.
4,Great ride,"ordered these to replace the original strus that had 135,000 miles on them. Install was 3 hours for the first and 1hour for the second after learning how on the first. The Trailblazer I installed them on rides like new and all the squeaks from the front end are now gone. Well worth the price."
2,Doesn't work with Nokia 3650,"As I said above - skip it if you have a Nokia 3650. Also, battery life is bad. I used it with Sony Ericsson T-68 and it lasts forty minutes maximum. On the positive side, the battery is replaceable unlike in some other BT headsets."
3,"Mine works okay, but...","I bought my iCruze last November because of a long trip I had coming up. I have the iCruze in my 2005 Chevy Silverado. It works as advertised, but I did receive a faulty interface. That was quickly replaced by the retailer. The bad part for me is that I paid full price for it. Now, I'm going to pick up the display on the cheap before this system goes the way of the Dodo.For what it's worth, the sound from my iCruze is perfect. Am I the only one with a working system?"
5,Relived recent trip,"Having just returned from our trip to Venice, I found this book invaluable to reliving our stay. Each time I look through this book, I'm transported back to Venice's Grand Canal, taking photos from the water bus on the way to Murano Island. I wonder how they got the photos without any other boats (even gondolas) on the Canal!"
5,Sorrowful Life of Joseph Merrick,I read this book in my Literature class where we began a journey into the life of Joseph Merrick(The Elephant Man). Merrick was born physically deformed that would scare anyone but had the most pure heart. This play is about how society drove this man into obsurity to hide his hideous face under a burlap sack until his oversized head falls back and he dies a most poetic death.
1,Simply terrible,"Just terrible. The first one sucked, and the second one, wait a minute, wait, oh, oh, it sucked even worse. I wouldn't have thought it possible that a movie could be worse than the first X-Men, but the sequel to that P.O.S. proved me wrong. This isn't a review like my normal ones (to bash things that deserve savage beatings), this is a warning. A warning NOT to purchase this or any movie in any relativity to it."
4,"X2 - Great Movie, Cool Special Effects","I did not see the first X-men movie. When I saw X2 I could follow the story perfectly. So if you haven't see the first one, you will still enjoy the second film. My favorite character in this film was Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler, he vanishes in a mist to reappear again - and his character also prays the Rosary. The special effects were incredible. Through the entire scene where Nightcrawler is in the White House, after the President, I was just in awe. Alan Cumming spent hours in makeup for this character, and it was well worth it. The other special effects are also stunning as well. It is an absolutely fun movie, with great special effects."
5,good price for an excellent movie!!!!,"everthing is good, the movie play witn no problem and the price was awesomw, thanks"
3,"""B"" Movie with class ""A"" Actors","The whole premise of there being of a mutant population throughout the world is the first thing that makes this movie lose its edge. For example, How interesting would it be to watch Superman if every other person in this world possessed similar powers. Nevertheless, if this concept was done right lets say with an apocolyptic or cryptic view, may be it could have been pulled off but, this movie consistantlhy loses its focus on the hero's and villians. It jumps from scene to scene senselessly. Even the X-Men's looked more like a group of plain people that put on their cheap holloween costumes. Hugh Jackman did a descent job of posing as the wolverine with his side burns but, were is the rest of the outfit?. It seemed like the script and special effects were rushed in this film.Overall X-men is a decent movie that should have been a classic on a par with the Superman series and Batman 1 and 2, however it ends being a notch below."
3,Not worth to keep for hearing impaired,"First thing, this movie is great action. I may agree with other comic lover's.I have the bad thing about this X Men 2 on special features. None of them are available fo SUBTITLE or CLOSED CAPTION that leave us, for hearing impaired so useless to watch this. It's better for you to rent it. Definely not worth to keep."
5,One of the best superhero movies ever made,"Xmen 2 is better than the first one. There is more action, more special effects, more mutants, and more of everything compared to the first one. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies based on comic books or even the average movie audience."
4,IT LOOKS GOOD,"The movie was very good, i saw it 12 times but it's still exciting now.It is way better than the first one, way more action!!! and the new characters r alsome so buy the DVD and enjoy the action"
3,Am I crazy?,"Am I crazy to think that the first movie was much better? X2 was entertaining, but got somewhat predictable. Good for an evening's entertainment, but I was disappointed."
5,Action-Action,My family love movies that have some type of action hero. This movie has proven to stand on its own with that. The characters are fast paced and not boring. The humor is well received and it brings a nice mix to the fast pace action. We did not find it gross with gore and truly was entertaining. Glad we purchased it for our home collection!
1,boo!,this is the boring movie of all time the bigining were great the middle part were great but on end is dumb why magneto want to help proffesor xavier instead fighting good story but on end was dumb brian singer should do better than x-men
1,empty,More violence.More techno babble instead of depth.More shallow people in bad costumes.More CGI manufactured nonsense to make kids spend their parents money to see more violence. This cycle must be broken.Stop paying the corporate suits that take your currency and waste your time.
3,this can't be worse than the first one,"I didn't like the first x-men that much cause it didn't have a lot of action, i don't know how this one's gonna be but the first one was dissapointing. i thought x-men was gonna be one of the best comic book movies but i was wrong,i was into the x men comic books when i was younger but this sequel has got to be better than the first weak one, i thought spider-man was better than x men cause it had a lot of action and x men didn't have any barely.Marvel is huge now since they're coming out with moves next year like daredevil, x men 2 and the hulk, you know what they should make a punisher movie, now that ill pay to see there! punisher's da man."
1,Dry and tasteless,"Did not enjoy the product and would not recommend. It's very dry and impossible to chew, has no taste and seems stale."
2,There are better alternatives out there than these pears,"I have been trying many of the dried fruits from this seller. Some are better than other, and these pears are a little on the less good side. They are a bit gritty and not very flavorful. The dried peaches, for example, from the same seller are much better. These pears are not chewy or tough enough to make them appealing from that aspect, so the gritty texture and lack of flavor stands out. The shipping rates charged by the seller are very high, and unless you buy in quantity the rates are too high to make it worthwhile to shop from this seller. I always put together a larger order of a variety of things from this seller to reduce the shipping costs enough to not be off the charts."
5,A great tail of life in the wild.,"I am an english student from Fort Mill High School. I had to read this book for an english project and it has become one of my favorites. It offers a great story of a man and the woods. The river seems to take on human like qulities that show up through out the book. The descriptions that Dickey uses make you spine tingle and your heart long to be in the woods. The story also has a special if you are the outdoor type of person like myself. The sensations become so real you become lost in the deep setting and plot of the story. I would reccomend this book to any outdoor lover, adventure guru, or book fanatic. It is a quick read that will be with you forever."
2,Not Top Quality,"I was expecting a good item, but this is just another stamped product for the masses. Cheap plastic fasteners was the initial turnoff, but the flimsy strapping leather was not worth further effort. My pistol fit the holster tightly (as it should) and would undoubtedly break-in in due time, but overall the quality of this product reminded me of a halloween costume accessory. For the money, go out and get a Mitch Rosen Stylemaster Express. Oh, and I'm no newbie to gun leather either."
3,Nasty people,"A very depressing book about an enchanting young woman (deceased) who was never understood or cared for by those closest to her. This is a very cruel view of humanity. Deftly written and very sad. Since it is written by lively, you know that it is better than 95% of the stuff being published, but it was not to my taste."
4,better than I thought,"I read the back cover of this book months ago and thought it looked intriguing, though perhaps not all that original. I couldn't resist, though, when it appeared on the discount table at Borders. I ended up reading this book in a day and a half. Lively tellls this story through chapters told from various characters' points of view. I was surprised at just how emotionally involved I became with each of these characters and their individual pursuits of love and happiness. I also liked the fact the reader does not learn the details of Kath's untimely death until nearly the very end. It helped to keep me interested and wanting to read more and more. I think most readers will find this book rewarding. A good one to talk about with your friends."
3,Good enough to read (once),"I will have to classify this one as JUST OK. Good enough to read but not impressive in my opinion. The story was ok, the characters ok, but it was all JUST OK for me.I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, not horrible, but very forgettable."
4,A beautiful book,"This is a really beautiful book. The pace is slow but rewarding. We get to know the characters as we would get to know people we meet, slowly but powerfully. Each of the characters is flawed in some very human way; the main character does not know how to ask for help or to be other than what is expected. Her sister is busy, busy, busy as is her husband. It's a familiar story in these days of multi-tasking for all. Do we take the time to see beyond the surface, do we really listen to each other. These are the questions this book asks."
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the worst book I've ever read. It's mind-numbingly boring. So much so that it's about the width of my pinky finger and I couldn't make it through half the book. I skipped ahead every 30 pages or so and figured the outcome. I'd like to rip it to shreds in anger. Literally. It's one of those books where the author tries to awe you with her intelligence and instead you end up more bored than you ever thought possible. If I can save one person from boredom and anger, then this review will have been worth it. I'm ashamed that people thought it was a good idea to publish this. So ashamed, in fact, that I've almost lost faith in the human race. PLEASE, don't buy this! It sucks so bad that I don't even know what to say."
3,Not The Best From Blue Note,"Although technically correct that most of these tunes are from the 1950's and 60's, The 9 by Tom Harrell 8 by Hal Galper and 9 by Mulgrew Miller, from later decades, represent a significant minority - 41%"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"THIS BOOK IS A REPRINT OF EARLY ELLROY NOVELS FEATURING LLOYD HOPKINS--A STEREOTYPICAL FICTION DETECTIVE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE BRILLANCE OF THE LA QUARTET OR AMERICAN TABLOID YOU WON'T FIND IT IN THESE AVERAGE, RUN OF THE MILL NOVELS. NOTE: A SINGLE STAR MAY SEEM TO BE A HARSH RATING, BUT IT IS MORE OF A REFLECTION ON THE HIGH REGARD I HOLD THE AUTHOR, PERHAPS THE BEST FICTION WRITER TODAY."
5,X-treamly great for fans as well as first-time watchers,"I absolutely loved this movie! I am a die-hard fan and i think they did a beautiful job on this film. It answered questions, while posing more; it brought first-time viewers up to date without boring the people who have seen every episode. I've heard people say that it was like a 2 hour episode, but i hardily disagree. The X-files movie brought out details of the relationship between Mulder and Skully as well as the deeper conspiracies in the government. This is a must have movie and i could watch it a thousand times without getting bored. Rent the movie or buy the tape, because there are new scenes added that clear up some questions that have been plegueing viewers for years and it also adds to the plot for people who don't watch the show."
3,OK,"This movie is Ok......Much better than I wan't to ..well you know. If you are a true X files fan, it shouldn't be missed ,but like any movie, it can't cover as much mythology as the series. X files movies are ok, but the SERIES (Season 1-7) is where it's at. Everything from the feel to the music is on point. Mulder and Scully are simply immortal."
4,X-Files movie,"My wife and I had to watch this as we are watching every episode of the series and the movie links season 5 to 6. It was good, basically an elaborate, 2 hour TV episode with some guest stars and more cursing. Glad I saw it."
3,Just one long x files episode on a grander scale...,"Ive been with the X-files since BEFORE it even aired...but this movie just seemed like a long drawn out episode with alot of special effects. dont get me wrong, the plot was decent, and the action okay, but overall i expected more."
3,meh,watchable. nothing special though. seems to have been a cash grab at the show's peak. didn't further the story enough for me even though several significant events occur.
5,The X-Files,"I have seen the complete series. They were excellent mini movies. The movie, The X-Files was as entertaining as the episodes of the series. In the movie, the action and the characterization were outstanding and enjoying in a much larger scale. It was worth buying it."
1,Did we really need this?,Here's the inside scoop folks: it's nothing more than an hour and a half EPISODE. They could have shown this for the season premier. Save your money and wait til it's on tv.
2,X-File Movie....or Show?,"Another hit... show? I thought the show was supposed to be a movie? Thats what probably a lot of you are asking. But, the movie is literally just like a show! The only real big thing was when Scully gets stung by a virus-carrying bee and, well, I won't tell you the rest, just go and watch the movie/show for yourself and see that the movie should really be called a show. Go on, stop reading the reviews and see for yourself!"
1,There Is No Truth,Save your money and buy some videos of the classic episodes like Deep Throat. This movie lacks the magic and uniqueness that made the show special to begin with. A total disappointment.
3,X-Files Is X-Files,"What can we say ? X-Files is X-Files ! The movie builds on the series, Conspiracy & Aliens ! The special Effects is Great ! It's in Widescreen, but the convertion from Cinema format to Widescreen TV format doesn't seem to be sucsesful ! The picture isn't like it shoud be. On my tv anyway !X-Files fans Buy, you others rent it !"
1,Left the theater before it ended,UUUUUGH! This movie sucked to high heaven. Horrible acting...and I mean HORRIBLE. I'd rather watch Object of My Affection TWICE than this movie again (that's how much I hated this film). What a cheesy plot. The first 15 minutes (the part with the cave man) made me laugh out loud. I WANT MY $5.00 BACK FOR HAVING TO WATCH THIS CRUD.
1,This was a horrible movie,I hate the show and the movie was even worse. I think that u should warn others not to buy.
3,Nearly there...,Too mass audience; too clumsy; too dull.Would have been much better to make the first movie an more-than-TV-scary MOW - to show horror movie makers what to do.Maybe the next movie will be a Millennium crossover...
2,Who hired these writers?,"What a piece of garbage. What kind of cover up is this when they blow up an entire building just to destroy three alien virus infected dead bodies and those bodies weren't even in the building so that Scully can perform her little autopsy and so that the movie can show you an awesome explosion of a building. Is this necessary??? What about those other firemen that worked together? Don't they know something's going on??? FEMA, a secret govenment? lol, now this is funny. Too bad for Michael Brown, our short live secret idiot president."
1,theyre all kids,"all these people writing 5 star reviews must be ten-year olds that checked the ""Im over 13 years old box"" before sudmitting their review. this was an spectacular example of film-makers on every illegal drug you can think of at the same time. its an insult to the entire world and anyone with any kind of intelligence. i cant believe i had to even give this crap a star."
5,Wonderful!,"Where do I start? The movie was amazing! I especially enjoyed the relationshipp between Mulder and Scully :). The special effects were great too. Yep, this movie gets an A+ in my book!"
3,The television stories were better!,"Too many questions are left unanswered; Duchovny lazily utters his lines; Mitch Pileggi (""Skinner"") has primarily a walk-on; Anderson seems uncertain; enigmatic villains the Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and the Well-Manicured Man (""John Neville) are onscreen too briefly; Academy Award-winner Martin Landau wanders around with the ""bug-eyed"" dumbfounded look, perhaps what the role called for.The film does sport some nifty exteriors and a frighteningly realistic explosion of a federal building.Both of those are not enough, however, to salvage a disappointing movie."
3,"Great movie, but the lack of features is a letdown","First off, if your an X-Files fan, grab this baby. The movie is amazing and ties in perfectly with the show. On the DVD side, the picture and sound are wonderful. My only complaint is the fact that FOX still doesnt use the full WIDESCREEN transfer that other DVDs have, i guess we'll have to wait til Alien Legacy to get the first TRUE widescreen from fox. Also i would have liked to see a couple more features, maybe story boards, behind the scenes FX work, cast interviews, and a full length commentary. Dont get me wrong, as a movie, this sucker racks up at least 4 stars, but the lack of DVD options pulls it down a bit."
3,just okay,"I was a fan of the series and I was really looking forward to seeing this, but this movie just felt like an overlong episode.Unnecessary and not all that entertaining."
5,E.T. on Blu-Ray is Awesome.,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial on Blu-Ray disc is awesome from the new HD Picture to the DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 mix to the extra features on the blu-ray they are great. The John Williams score has never sounded better and the jump in picture quality is amazing for this blu-ray release. Great job Universal Studios you did an amazing job on this new blu-ray of E.T.
3,I'm so glad they included the original...,"Who in heaven's name thought it was a good idea to re-visit this film in the editing booth?FBI agents and police don't carry guns? Upon learning of extraterrestrial invasion? Even in a kid's movie, that stretches credibility. (I'm glad they had radios!) Next you'll be telling me that Han Solo didn't shoot first! (Oh, wait!)Buy it for the original version, use the new version as a coaster."
2,One of the most overrated films ever.,"There were some good things about this movie. Henry Thomas was one of them. Drew Barrymore turned in the only good work of her professional career. There was an occasional touch of humor (E.T. hiding among the stuffed animals in the closet, for example).But overall, it was maudlin and lacked consistency, and was diluted by the cheap laughs that Hollywood garners by having little kids use vulgar language. Also, It doesn't take a genius to see the pseudo-religious allegory in the story. That probably says a lot about our society; people reject traditional religion, but still have a yearning to believe in something bigger and better than themselves. They satisfy that yearning by believing in warm and fuzzy aliens. Hence the hordes of people who give this very unexceptional movie 5 stars."
5,Steven Spielberg proves that he can do any kind of movies,"This Movie is one of my best ones, Steven Spielberg is a genuis director, he can make you FEEL and LIVE the movie he makes with a very SIMPLE way, no complications, just being simple and perfect, that movie is the best, He created a very loving Alien, He used this simple boy, that very perfect directing, no (over use) of since fiction or animation, he just makes that movie to ""TOUCH OUR HEARTS"" and untill those present days, after those years, it still touches our heart like the first time we watche it, Steven Spielberg,.....YOU are GREAT, thank you so much Mr. Spielberg..."
5,"""Turn on your heart light now. . . ""","I sit and watch this gem of a movie and think about a song by Neil Diamond, ""Heartlight"".Yes, after all these years the end still moves me to weep. But it's worth it.""I'll be right here."" - E.T."
1,Don't buy Censored Movies,"I am getting tired of this and positively will NOT buy Edited/Censored DVDs! Not even a little tiny little edit is ok, another great movie ruined by the suits."
1,Please Hollywood stop making bad movies,"I can't belive there are people who like this movie. And my biggest reason of all for giving this 1 star is because of most of the movie, we can hardly see E.T. If you found an alien in your backyard, would you secretly keep him and not tell your parents. That's the hero in this movie does. His name is Elliott (Henry Thomas). One night he finds E.T (voice of Michael Patrick Bilon) in his backyard. At first he tells his family and they don't believe him. But when E.T comes back, Elliott shows his family (except his mother, he shows him to his brothers and sister). I can't even believe this is a children's movie. But I think it should have gotten a PG-13 from the MPAA.There is much better family movies, like Lilo & Stitch, Shrek, Monsters Inc, Ice Age, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, etc"
5,Still a gold standard,"Despite a few minor things I would change, E.T. is still a gold standard for cinema after all these years. Great overall story, yet it is the so many subtleties in the movie that give it an extra shine. It is quite intricately scripted and edited, which give it a lot of extra character and drama. Effective soundtrack as well. Lighting effects. Worth a lot of study."
5,Come as discribed. Very satisfied.,I ordered it like new but opened and thats just how it came. No scratches or anything. Just as discribed.
5,Off the hook!!,"I love all of her books, the entire series but you have to start from the first book and stay on order. Very Good Job on this series!!"
2,When somebody loves you back,This book drug the storyline out forever. I read it because it was supposed to be as good as She's not the one. This book was both boring and pointless. Mary B Morrison should stick to co-authoring books with other writers. This is the 3rd book of hers I have purchased and all of them have been terrible. Carl Weber is the true author of She's Not The One. His contribution made the book exciting and a good read.When Somebody Loves You Back
4,Just what I was looking for,"I have always been so impressed with John Coltrane's music, but also with his impact on so many different musicians. This book gave a glimpse into the drive he had toward his music. And the personality that he has that was part of what made his music affect so many. The musical terms were over my head, but the awareness of how crafted his music is came through."
5,Nice smooth fit!!!,Very nice fit! The material is a great fit for my 76 keyboard. I absolutely love it!! It arrived just in time.
5,Perfect Fragrance for Spring ~ Summer,"-This cologne has a lemonade like fruity + citric smell. It also has a subdued sweet smell that blends into your natural body scent. Although this cologne is not a woody type of cologne, it can fit with the fresh nature and leaves other an impression of you as a light-hearted and gently outgoing person. This cologne will be perfect for younger people in age of late 10's to mid-late 20's. I'll recommend this product especially to college frosh. It will leave others good impressions of you !"
1,Poor Quality Tape Recording,"The quality of the image from the VHS tape is very bad. I contacted Amazon and they send a replacement but it was not a good quality showing, but keepable because the plot is so enjoyable. Amazon was very good about the replacement and provided the return shipping cost."
1,Soulless,Thumbs down to Sony for unleashing this CD on AOR radio. Kind of like getting a root canal for the ears. Please stop Michal Bolton's career.
1,Something For Floyd To Sweep Away,Hopefully this CD will be taken away by the next natural disaster. This is awful stuff.
4,Broken Arrow,crystal clear video ( no loss )audio puts you right in the pilots seat of the Stealth.4 out of 5
4,A good movie,Both Travolta and Slater where excellent in my opinion. The story was well written and completely realistic. If you want to see a movie that tells a good story.
3,Good movie,"This may be the first time John Travolta played a bad guy. John, has stolen a nuke and intends to use it for ransom. Christian Slater discovers the plot and takes it before he can get away. The movie focuses on John chasing Christian to get the bomb back. Good acting and good action sequences. If your up late and can't sleep this is the ticket."
3,Deja vu? THUNDERBALL!,"Broken Arrow is a virtual retread of the James Bond classic, Thunderball. In both movies, a criminal syndicate plots to steal two nuclear warheads and threaten the world. Broken Arrow doesn't even bother to change the number of warheads stolen. Like Thunderball, the bombs are stolen from a high-tech bomber by a pilot who is not what he seems(In Thunderball, the villainous agent was made into the image of the man with access to the bomber through surgery.). Also, the villain doesn't meet his demise in a hokey boxing match. Why does Travolta do this? He has a machine gun laying around somewhere, so why doesn't he kill Slater and get it over with? There is also the device for setting off the bomb. In Thunderball it looked like a cylinder. Broken Arrow replaced this with a cell-phone like remote. Nothing is developed. The reason I gave Thunderball....er..Broken Arrow three stars is because it is fun and nothing else."
2,Just Brainless...,"Broken Arrow was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: John Travolta and Christian Slater among others.The movie brings to the screen the story of a routine stealth bomber flight over the US gone awry resulting in the theft of the two nuclear missiles it was carrying.In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) The brainless plot, the brainless action, and the brainless dialogues.2) All the impossible situations that the heroes got themselves out of.3) The Park Ranger. First she attempts to arrest a US Air force pilot (!) instead of offering assistance and then she turns into John Rambo for the duration of the film! She is a Park Ranger for crying out loud!As for the rating, it should have been PG-13.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.No masterpiece here."
4,pretty damn good,"A favorite of mine when i was a kid. here i am 10 years later still watching it. Back when Travolta was still popular, and Christian Slator wasn't a wife beater, this movie rocked. hell, it still rocks. I still remember seeing this one in the theatres... ahh memories"
4,John Woo's first American movie,Lots of action and typical John Woo action film. It's interesting to see American stars (Travolta and Slater)act under his direction. Travolta's performance is excellent as the antagonist.
3,Decent book; geared toward big-money candidates with pre-existing connections,"When I ran for office in 2004, I purchased four or five how-to-run-a-campaign books, and while they all included some unique insights (this one included), RUNNING FOR OFFICE was easily the least helpful of the bunch. The worst aspect of this book is that it presupposes that you're going to be running a big-money campaign as a Democrat or Republican, and that you have wealthy friends and/or political connections. If that is the case, then do you really need this - or any - book? I would not discourage a potential candidate from purchasing and reading this book, but it should not be your first or only choice. There are much better how-to-run-for-office books out there. Check my other reviews."
2,"Well Made, if Cliche Story of Teen Heartbreak","The symbolism is a bit heavy-handed, the parallel stories of the wounded hawk re-taught to fly and Pauline the damaged teen whose rejection by the girl she desperately loves is too much for her. But the exquisite music, fine acting, sharp photography and editing, and the physical beauty of the three leads combine to give power to this simple story of love and loss. The handling of the setting -- a girl's boarding school -- is not exploitative but sympathetic. Pretty good all around. An English treatment of the theme -- forbidden love at boarding school -- is Karel Reisz' excellent 1982Another Countrywith Colin Firth and Rupert Everett."
2,"""CHEESY and Delirious""","I was fully expectating another good gay-teenage drama. So many good reviews for this movie, so my criticism is valid since I was expecting it to be good.This movie was sophomoric. The visual look was like a made-for-TV movie, which always means the story isn't any better. The acting was plain jane bordering on Cheesy(except for Piper Perabo). The characters weren't interesting or unique--and there were a few cliches: the token minority girl (the Asian); the wise Native American man to give the movie some male presence.The story wasn't so bad. Just the delivery of these components made it such a failure.Avoid this movie. If you want a nice lesbian teen movie, go for ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" or ""The Incredibly true story of two girls in love""."
4,Lost and Delirious,"An incredible, very moving and believable, love story between two young girls. Extremely well acted with a somewhat over melodramatic ending. A must see that will leave your heart broken and teary-eyed."
5,none more beautiful than this,"oh, dear god, how can somene create something as beautiful as this. in a wierd way i am reminded of my self and a long time love of mine, elizabeth. so this movie brought a lot of painful emotions to the surface, but is was so beautiful at the same time. i sat and stared breathlessly at the tv when the movie ended from being completely ambushed with emotion. it is definately one of the most beautiful movies that ive ever seen...and ive seen a lot of movies and have really high standards. i loved this movie to say the least"
2,Eh,"I liked this movie for a few minutes, then it became a frustrating exercise in misery.The ending was a complete bummer...and I couldn't help but notice that the one character (Played by Picabo) spent a hell of a lot of time running aimlessly all over the school grounds.Get into fight with girlfriend...run.Get upset about girlfriend...run some more.Get caught in bed with girlfriend...run, run, run.This chick runs everywhere!It gets tedious.I'm in the minority on this one. A lot of people love this flick, but depressing, doomed love just doesn't do it for me."
5,Not What I Expected,"When I first heard about this movie I thought, ""Cool. A lesbian love story with Piper Perabo. She is so hot."" But, when I finally got around to watching it, I was blown away. I mean this is one of the most touching, romantic, and amazing films I've ever seen. The words are poetry, the actresses are amazing, and the story is so good that I can't even find words to describe it. I recomend this movie to every romantic person out there."
4,Beautifully Tragic,"This movie had one of the sweetest displays of romanticism I have ever seen. I highly recomend this movie.... But keep the kleenex box close by, it is a tearjerker."
3,Script for Bad Lifetime Movie,"The fact that I did finish this book must mean it was, at least, somewhat interesting. Very well written, it is really like the stories you would expect to see in a soap opera.I do not want to write a spoiler but there were some things I just could not get past, one of them being that this woman pined away for years for a guy she married in her teens who shot her. Granted, he did not MEAN to hurt her. Through all her following marriages, good or bad, she loves him. This goes on for years. After her last husband dies, guess what happens?Oh, I forgot to write that all men just are crazy for her!"
2,"Mr. Allen, your shtick is old, old, OLD!","Another Woody Allen film, another parade of pointless cameos of Hollywood stars clamoring to be in a Woody Allen film. I've enjoyed Allen's previous films, but after viewing Deconstructing Harry, I 'm afraid Woody Allen just grates on me now. His neurotic shtick is the same in all of his comedy films, regurgitated ad infinitum. Mr. Allen, you make good films, but PLEASE, stay behind the camera!"
2,quirky,"The film was the usual oddity by the director, with a number ofhumorous vignettes: The fight with his analist wife during hersession with a patient, a visit to the lowest level of hell tovisit satan and bump into the inventor of aluminum siding, anda serial cannibal. I don't think that it will make any top filmlists."
2,"Good, but long","I love the Thoenes, but I did not really like this series. While descriptive and interesting, the pace of the books are so slow (in time, not action--i.e, one book only takes place over only one or two days) that I did not make it all the way through the books. They are meant to be slow, but personally, I like to keep things moving. I would recommend Zion Covenant, Zion Chronicles, A.D. Chronicles, or, my favorites, the Galway Chronicles and the Shiloh Legacay over this series, especially if you are a first time reader of their usually wonderful work. (By the way, something I really like is that her series often overlap with characters. If you want to get to know all the characters, the order kind of goes like this: Zion Covenant and the Shiloh Legacy, then the Zion Chronicles, and then this series.)"
2,You'll keep on paying.,"In my experience, the problem with Ipaq has been reliability. I bought top-of-the-line at a cost which should have provided me equipment that would work. First the little spring that holds the stylus in place gave out. HP/Compaq did cover this by stretching the warranty, so the only cost to me was the hassle and a couple of replacement styluses at $5 a pop. Then the battery died, after I'd had the unit for about 18 months. What was really distressing was the refusal on the part of the service ""support"" people to recognize this as any sort of problem -- they were so busy trying to think of creative explanations involving things I might have done wrong that nobody would acknowledge that if customers who buy an Ipaq have to budget $50.00 a year for battery replacement that represents a quality control issue at the old Ipaq factory. Do what my wife did -- order a Dell and include a back-up battery in the package."
3,Enjoyable but not much action...,I enjoyed this book but would've like to see some more excitement or earlier romance. It's not until around page 275 or later when Adam & Brandy finally get together so if you like a lot of hooking up in your books this may not be the right book but if you don't mind the romance building up over a few hundred pages until it finally happens then this book is good but theres just not tons of excitement. If I could I would've gave the book 3.5 stars.
1,mostly disappointing,"Based on a dispensationalist theology and so-called prophetic interpretation, this book was rather disappointing. This book was written to sound more like a general discussion, rather than a well thought out, soul searching commentary, which was surprising considering the 'suffering' the author is said to have endured. Where is the questioning? Where is the pain? Where is the substance that those who have suffered and endured for so long are searching for? Having said that, there is some merit to the book, in that it gives a general commentary on Job - nothing you couldn't find in a meatier book though. I'd recommend books like: 'God and Human Suffering' (Hall); 'Where is God when it hurts' (Yancey); and 'Prayer' (Yancey) as an alternative to exploring pain and suffering in general. These guys provide far more insight and depth in one chapter than Sorge does in his whole book."
1,very funny stuff,"Ashida Kim's works are very humurous works and should be regarded only as such. The techniques and philosphies presented in this book as well as Kim's others are not true to that taught by Dr. Hatsumi, the current legtimate grandmaster of the art. If you are seriously intrested in this subject I suggest a book by Dr. Hatsumi or S.K. Hayes. Ninpo ikan."
1,Bogus work from a bogus writer,Please - Anyone who reads these books by Ashida Kim and likes them needs to get into reality. These books DO NOT reflect Ninjutsu and how it was/is studied. Check out books by Hayes and Hatsumi if you want the real stuff. These Kim books do not teach you correct technique - Just ways to hurt yourself.
2,"No as ""camp"" as some!",Well what can I say? This is an interesting read. Basically a monologue of an unidentified participant at an Ashida Kim ninja training camp. Survival skills and ambushes are covered along with some empty hand and gun defences. I would say though that if you were not a fan of Ashida Kim then I would not bother. It either adds to his myth or his legend. It depends on our view of him. You either love him or hate him!
4,1st Ellora's Cave book,"I had fun with Ms. Ames story of undercover bodyguard guarding her secret fantasy. I did find the thought of hiring a mistres a little of a strech but maybe I'm a prude and I don't live like the wealthy do. Hero and Heroine explode with sexual tension and when they get together those two heat up the sheets between the bed and the book. The suspense element of who is stalking the Hero is is not really seen except for some letters, until the almost end of the book, I found the 'reason' for the stalking to be questionable but since stalkers are crazy then it usually is not always understood. But you will enojoy the romance and good good lovin"
5,Realistic Pinball Action!,"I got this game about 2 weeks ago,and I love it! It has the most realistic action I've ever seen in a computer pinball game. You can even win replays just like the arcade versions,(although some of the arcade versions did not have this feature). All in all, I have to give this game the highest rating ; best graphics, best action, replay awards, best sounds,(including the electric buzzing when operating the flippers on the older games!).Overall ; challenging & fun, just like the real thing!"
3,There is a dark side to this,"I loved this book until I started to do some research on carlos castaneda and taisha. If you want to find out more you can watch the BBC documentary on Carlos Castaneda which can be found on You Tube, but to make a long story short, Carlos basically made up the material in his books, as did taisha. If you are wondering why there is no sequal to this book it is because the author is dead. She commited suicide after Carlos died."
5,A must read,This is an insightful story about one woman's initiation into shamanism. It is a compelling read and full of information.I haven't found many books on shamanism I would rate this highly.
4,The Sorcerer's Crossing A Womans Journey (Arkana),I found her journey scarey and exciting at the same time. Being about trusting in herself and others was important. It was worth reading.
2,I have another Bag of Magical Beans for you all...,"Look, people, if you want to actually learn the art of stalking rather than just read about it, eat some meat, if you are a vegan, or viceversa. If you think of yourself as being clever, try acting stupid. If you are a natural jerk, try being nice to people. If you think you are a very good person, try being rude to another. Do you get my drift? If you don't, maybe you DO need to read some more about stalking. Carlos himself once said that his books are nothing but an index to an alternate way of being. So! Stop reading and do some not-doing in your life. Bye."
5,Fantastic CD!,"As a former preschool teacher, this CD was one of the best I ever heard! It was something that I could put on frequently that all the children would immediately get excited and begin participating in. The songs always got all the children up and moving around - myself and my coworkers as well! I would higly recommend this CD - it is a timeless classic."

1,Wait till you see it in person!,"This was my first and last attempt at buying linens without seeing them. Despite the great discount, it's a very cheesy set that would work well in a motel room. The color is bland and the quality nothing to write home about. I tried to dress it up with some contrasting pillows, a blanket but it's useless.Try and see these things in person or trust the taste of the store offering the item. Looks like someone wanted to dump them fast.Avoid!"
2,No Difference,"When I got this unit, I showed it to Louie, the cat I was hoping would change his behavior of using things other than the litter box. Not only was Louie not thrilled, but he took one whiff and crawled under the dresser! It's hard to say for sure if it worked, because at the same time, I added another litter box to the household. But, I certainly don't notice any difference from either Louie or Gomez, my other cat."
1,"Wow, Absolutely Nothing","No change in behavior in my cats. I have had this product in place for a week. My neutered male is still roaming around, vocalizing constantly. My older female is still mean to my younger female. Not one change in any problematic behavior. It is as if the diffuser is not even in place."
1,Didn't work at all,"I bought this so my cats would stop being so crazy at night. They claw the bed, bat at my toes, and meow trying to wake us up. It did not work for this purpose."
2,Expensive product with no clear benefits...,"After reading a bunch of reviews I ordered this for my two housecats to ease the transition into a new home. I have had the Feliway diffuser plugged in for the last month and have not seen any change in the behavior or disposition in my cats. Vertical scratching and irrationally fearful behavior when new visitors arrive still persist. It has definitely not helped ""comfort"" the cats in the ways advertised. Of course I don't expect miracles but I expected to see some change. Now that 30 days have gone by I am reluctant to spend another $20 to refill the diffuser. Maybe a Glade plugin will work just as well!"
1,Ugh. Doesn't work.,I wish it did. The rate of cat spraying in our house didn't increase or decrease with the use of this product. It was a total waste of money.
3,Diffusers,I cannot say that they have made a difference or I just do not want to imagine what my crazy cat house would be without one in every room. I have been trying them for 90 days now and the constant fighting has continued.
5,Seems to work,"within 10 minutes of plugging this in, it turned my Maine Coon attack cat into a pansy. I can now pet is stomach without losing an arm. He is much more affectionate and passive. Works for me!"
1,My cat tinkled *on* the diffuser,The title of my review pretty much says it all. Try something else instead.
1,This is not working for me,I have had this plugged in for about 3 weeks andd the adult cat still growls as soon as he comes in and sees the kitten. I would not recommend this item.
1,I would not purchase again,"I bought this product with the hope that it would help my two cats get along after referred aggression issues (one can seeing another cat outside the house and taking it out on their fellow house cat because they are unable to get at the cat outside). Despite the claims this product makes, it did not seem to provide any benefit to the situation over an extended period of time.It would not surprise me if this product only exists because there are enough desperate people out there with cat behavior issues to create enough anecdotal evidence to keep sales going. It's like praying - you're bound to get what you ask for some of time. But that's just my hunch. I don't have any more evidence of that than the sellers do that this is scientifically proven to work.In any event, I am not convinced this product is effective and would not purchase it again."
3,Maybe not so effective for large numbers of cats,"I have a very unique situation of a large number of cats at home, sort of a small cat sanctuary (more than 10 indoor only cats). I had high hopes that this would help calm things down and put an end to the skirmishes. I read many reviews and think that for those 2 or 3 cat households, this will work fine. But after a week, I have not seen a marked improvement, in fact one of my cats peed right next to it. I purchased diffusers based on the description of ""600 +/- square feet"" but maybe because we have so many cats, we might need more diffusers. If you have a large number of cats, consider getting one for each room. I am."
1,Not effective at all,"I tried everything to stop a newly adopted 2 year old cat from peeing on the floor. I used 2 Feliway diffusers, the spray and even meds from the vet. In desperation, and on the verge of bringing the cat to a shelter, I tried Cat Attract Kitty Litter. Save your money, try the Cat Attract litter first!"
3,Feliway Spray,"I don't have anything against this product - it was easy to use and everything. But, it said that it worked to eliminate pet urination in 95% of cases. We thoroughly cleaned the area before using the feliway, but I guess my cats are in the 5% bracket..."
1,Did not work,Got the product once we brought home a new kitten to help the resident cat adjust after a negetive initial reaction. One month later and the hissing and swatting continues. No change at all. Don't waste your money.
1,Didn't work for me... :-(,"I was hoping that this would stop my 5 month old kittens from peeing on my couch. My 15 year old cat had had an accident there before she passed away, and I cleaned it thoroughly. I can't smell it anymore, but I guess they can. I had them checked for health problems, but apparently, they're fine. The Feliway might work if they were trying to mark the couch, but I think they just like it better than the litter. So, I'm trying other things--multiple litter boxes, different litter, 10 different cleaners. Sigh!"
2,Product did not work for me...,Although I received the product fast the product did not result in any changes with my cat. The reason I bought the product was because I was joining 2 adult cats together in the same apartment. Both are female and very protective. I bought the product to help calm the cats. I saw no change. One of the cats has a problem with marking her territory. I saw no change in that. All in all I will not buy this product again.
3,Peacemaker,"This is the first time I have purchased this product, so I have only used it for 1 month. It's quite pricey, but I was desperate. My older cat had to be hospitalized, and when he returned home the younger one (both neutered males) declared war. After 1 month of use things have calmed down a great deal. I bought a refill and will use it for another month. The reason for the 3 stars is it is difficult to tell how much of their good behavior is just getting used to each other again, and how much is due to the diffuser. If you have fighting cats, it's worth a try."
4,Seems to Work,"I always plug one of these in when something stressful is going to happen. I had it in for a month when I brought my first cat home, and again for another month 1 year later when I got a 2nd cat. The transitions went so smoothly I assume that the diffusers were working to help the cats feel at ease. I have never had any marking or scratching behavior from either of my cats."
1,Feliway Diffuser,"I didn't notice any changes, even when I used it alone. Maybe I needed more than one, but for the price, which is cheaper than in the pet stores, I'm not going to try multiples."
4,Eventually you see the difference.,I have adopted a few overly stressed cats and this does help with their social skills although the affect is not immediate.It seems the price on these items is a little high.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I used this product (for 5 months- I think I gave it a good try) and it didn't make a bit of difference except in my bank account. Maybe it'd work for mildly neurotic cats, but if you have a Siameese (those who own one know how intensely high strung and easily stressed out they can get)- I'll spare you the suspense and tell you it does not work. The only thing I've found that works is kitty prozac. Controversial as it may be, it's better than the shelter. Call your vet- a moth's supply is about 8.00."
1,No good,I read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it. Well that chance did not pay off. Even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere. If anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it.
2,Didn't work with my cats,"I have two cats, and neither of them had any noticeable changes in behavior when the diffuser was in use. I used up the entire cartridge, and when it ran out I decided to wait a couple of weeks and observe for any changes before buying another cartridge. The cats continued to behave in the same manner they always did--before, during, and after this diffuser was used. This may be a miracle product for some, but honestly I feel like it's just a gimmick... I'm just glad I decided to wait before buying a refill; it would have been a waste of money."
2,Feliway Diffuser,"Can't say it worked for me, but could have been my cats. What worked was completely replacing all the litter boxes and the litter - basically starting all over. That stopped my problem. I won't need to use this product."
2,Didn't work - but I had to try it,"After dealing with my cat peeing on the dining room floor for months, I bought this product out of desperation. I was impressed with the positive reviews and figured it was worth a shot. Unfortunately this product did not work. Actually, I can't say there was any effect at all.But, obviously it has worked for some people so I'm glad I tried it out."
2,No effect for us...,"Alas, this had no discernable effect on my cats. However, the product arrived in good time and in good shape."
2,Didn't do much....,"This product didn't really do much to ease our cat's nerves. In fact, they seemed to get worse. The cats smelled something immediately, but it didn't have the effect we were told it would. A lot of expense for little effect. I would try other methods first."
3,"Works on Some Cats, But Not All!","I have a female and a neutered male cat that started spraying. This product worked great on the female. She stopped spraying almost immediately. She is the type of cat that has more anxiety and a worried temperment. This product works GREAT for her. She seems very calm and relaxed now. Doesn't even seem like the same cat! My neutered male cat naturally has a very relaxed, kick-back personality. I didn't notice any difference with him when using this product, and he's still spraying. So, I would try the product for your cat... because for those cats that respond to it like my female -- it works GREAT!"
2,LUKE WARM,I PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT TO CALM MY CAT AFTER A MOVING INTO ANOTHER APARTMENT. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE! SHE IS STILL HIDING UNDER MY BED AND DOESN'T COME OUT UNTIL SHE USE HER CAT BOX OR EAT!
2,The little bottle was licking,"When I received the little bottle was licking, so I wrote to Amazon.com, they answered me and wanted to send another bottle, they asked if to the same address, but then I was ill for several days and I couldn't answer them back, when I finally did, there was no answer from Amazon. So, I still don't know if the product works because I didn't want to plug it with the licking bottle... I'm ratting the product with just 2 stars, anyway I would like to try it and maybe try the spray too."
1,Full of ahistorical assertions and disingenuous arguments,"In this book the author argues for the ""economic benefits of trade, not just for corporations but for people and the environment. He illustrates how protectionist policies damage the economy and fail to save jobs. Examining U.S. trade policy, he shows how ""fair trade"" measures are arbitrary, unfair, and often harmful""Yet this author makes slight of America's long history of protectionist policies when it served its interest. In fact the history of America's industrial development was protecting her rising industries. So now that Americas industries are strong and known world wide; its labor force is a problem because it wants decent wages and health benefits. What is the solution? Free trade! Or free trade in cheap labor and dealing with counties that have no labor unions, no regulations that get in the way of business and officials that are easy to bribe.This book is for those who have no critical facilities what so ever."
1,Waste of money,I bought this book hoping it would help me with my resume. The example resumes are terrible. You can get better resume writing advice for free from many university career center websites.
2,Does not lock well!,"This case seemed nice at first. I never take the iPod out of the case. However, on several occasions I have noticed the locking mechanism has almost come undone. Usually just one of the locks. Unfortunately, one day when I was leaving for work walking down my concrete side walk, both must have come undone, for my iPod went skipping down the side walk in front of me! Luckily it only got a little scratched up and still works.I must say that I am now looking for a new protective case."
3,Middle of the road,"I was looking for an all purpose seat cover. These are not bad, but not great. They are fairly attractive and fit pretty goo don a 2001 Tacoma. The only problem is the material finish, it sort of attracts dirt and pet fur. I don't regret my purchase. I got a good product for a reasonable price."
2,not my favorite..,"i don't really care for atreyu. I like the hxc scene, but not them. I'll say that their songs are catchy and amusing for a while. They guitar work is decent enough, but the vocals are on the far side of hardcore, more twards metal. They're becoming too mainstream, like every band on victory records. They're even worse like in concert, i'm glad they got booed of stage. If you want some good hardcore bands go to as i lay dying, norma jean, unearth, my children my bride, the bled, or buried a lie (no thats not senses fail). A decent song by them is lipgloss and black."
2,Good but...,"Good... but really....I think Atreyu is just trying to be like Haste the Day, though the vocals don't compare to Jimmy Ryan's.So many people at my school walk around wearing atreyu apparel, though I've only seen two other people (besides myself) wearing Haste the Day or even Zao (who these guys are copying off of...I mean cmon, the came first and in my opinion are a lot better at writing this kinda music).As for this album, I've listened to lots of it, but not the entire thing. I personally dislike it because it doesn't come close to other bands of the genre that I listen to. But go with the phad and pick up a copy if you must. Otherwise I'd suggest Haste the Day."
4,anne rice would be proud!,"i have been listening to atreyu religiously for a long time. suicide notes is one of my all time favorite records so naturaly i thought the curse would be good but not as good. and what i have to say is it is as good, but in a different respect. this album is more melodic in terms of the music and the melodies. there is less screaming than in suicide notes, but it makes up for it in guitar solos and more thoughtout structure. and as for the ""glam"" comments from the hardcore kids, i think that atreyu is bad ass because of their immage as well as the music, these guys may wear makeup and sing about vampires but they can still kick your ass!! i recommend it to fans of afi avenged sevenfold and thrice."
1,Music?,Demonic.......violent.......warped. More music for the brain dead. It's scary to consider that some people like this garbage and call it music.
3,Good but bad at the same time,Alright i never heard atreyu before just heard they were good/bad from people So this isnt a one sided review i like ever type of metal. So i was at wal-mart(yes walmart) and got it for 8.99 I figured thay cant be that bad and if they were the cover art was worth it(i love that chick). BUt anywayz i listened to it like 20 times the last 3 days or so there good very good at every thing sept for one thing they singer that growls on Half the songs DOES SOUND LIKE A SCREAMING PIG/MONKEY! the rest of the somgs hes good but also in one song sounds like hes going through puberty during the song his voice go out of control its just bad. All in all i would buy this cd for the felling/lyrics+ the chick on the cover but dont expect some super hardcore band that has a good screamer / singer cuz they only have the singer.O and they say there not screamo but they are what els would thay be?
1,What the f*ck... Is this ?,"Atreyu is horrible and any one that loves true metalcore can see that their posers. I mean, whats with the vampire thing? Stop ripping of cof and having emo like lirycs, do not make you a blackmetal band. Infact, what the hell do the guys from atreyu are trying to be? Lost little children. Trust me, atreyu's ""the curse"" is not worth nothing. Not recommended."
1,This is fake music. Period.,"(...)If you want real metal, listen to Slayer, Anthrax, or old Metallica. If you want real hardcore, listen to Black Flag or Suicidal Tendencies. If you want real emo (yes, there is good emo), listen to Glasseater.(...)"
5,I'm an Anne Rice novel come to life.,"This is the perfect cd to buy if you are into hardcore with a dose of emo, vampires and love lost."
4,whats with all of the bad reviews?,"(im 14 i just didnt feel like signing up my dad already has an account.)I dont know about you people but I loved The Curse. Everyone keeps saying that the singer has a bad voice. Its not bad...its just different. I dont see anything wrong with being different. I don't think they should be put under a deathmetal category what with all the singing n stuff. My favorite songs were Bleeding Mascara, Right Side of the Bed, and The Crimson. I give it 4 stars because I dont think it was as good as Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses. They should try to be as good as Suicide but most bands dont usually reach the success of their best albums. Or atleast the ones I listen to dont."
4,Why does this band attract so many poseurs?,"I mean, jesus, Slipknot has to be one of the worst bands ever, they are just a gimmick wrapped upon generic music, and i've been a fan of Atreyu since 2001, anyways on with my review.I like the Curse better than Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, because the melody has vastly improved from before, and Alex's voice seems less scratchy and Brandon's voice sounds well rounded out now, which helps, here are my song by song reviews.1. Blood Children- intro2. Bleeding Mascara- 4/53. Right Side of the Bed- 3/54. This Flesh a Tomb- 4/55. You Eclipsed By Me- 4/56. The Crimson- 5/57. The Rememberance Ballad- 4/58. An Interlude- filler9. Corseting- 3/510. Demonology of Heartache- 5/511. My Sanity on a Funeral Pyre- 4/512. Nevada's Grace- 4/513. Five Vicodin...- 4/5"
1,Go buy a McLusky album. Trust me.,"Wow. This band is terrible. Whats even more terrible is that during the next year there will be 50 other bands that sound just like this. If this is what the kids are into, I fear for the future."
1,"Metalcore sucks, just like nu metal","What's the difference between nu metal and metalcore? Not as much as you might think. Metalcore is arguably heavier and more ""intense"" than nu metal per se, but both genre's rely on trends lifted from other styles of music.With nu metal, you had an entire legion of baggy-pants wearing bands who desperately wanted to sound like Helmet, Faith No More and Rage Against the Machine....and doing a piss poor job of it.With metalcore, you have an entire legion of tight women's jeans-wearing fashion whore bands who pathetically copy elements of European metal and classic 80's thrash.In that respect, both of these styles of heavy music are derivative, by-the-numbers and boring. Atreyu is simply another faceless mess of eyeliner and bad arpeggios in a swirling sea of dull heavy music."
3,"Yeah, it was okay... but....","It's repetitive. It's an album of the same song, over and over again. Don't misunderstand, that one song is ridculous awesome, but by the halfway point, you're reaching for another CD.Here's how it goes: amazing riff, punching drums, screaming vocals, beyond crazy melody sung by the drummer for the chorus, more screaming from lead singer, more excellent chorus, end of song.""The Rememberance Ballad"" is by far the best song on the album. The chorus is so infectious, I can't help but sing along."
3,"Good, but bad","I am not a longtime atreyu fan, so I won't act like it. But this one is not nearly as powerful as Suicide Notes is. Sure, the music is more intricate and the production is better (Which in my opinion makes it sound weaker), but there seems to be a less sincere feeling about the album lyrically. The screaming is better sounding on this one, but there also is WAY more singing which sounds way too fake. I dunno, Suicide Notes had better hooks and breakdowns and it had a raw sound to it that I personally dig. I really like the song ""you eclipsed by me"", though. It is a standout. Bottom line is that this sounds MTV friendly and not as powerful as the last. Yes, I know it is cliche, but it sounds mainstream. And yes, I don't like mainstream music. Listen to it before you buy it. : )"
2,Metalcore rawks!!!,"""Atreyu"" was the name of the cute little warrior boy in the movie NEVERENDING STORY. Great movie. These guys are HEAVY. I'd imagine they look like the Strokes (with longer, cooler hair.) You will like this... if you're weenie."
2,way overpriced,"I like quality and I also like a good deal. Mr. Brenner has an amazing garden and is obviously knowledgable but it seemed like he had no script. He repeated his four main ideas numerous times and the whole dvd seems like an amatuer production. I bought Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn which included 3 dvds and hours of gorgeous video for the same price! Unless the price comes way down, people will be disappointed. He had some great ideas and a lovely garden...he just needs a more professional production or a much more reasonable price."
5,Just what we wanted,"We had purchased one of these previously and enjoyed having it so much that we wanted another that would be interchangeable. Looks nice, and the cedar lends a pleasant smell to the nursery where the second one is kept. The only cosmetic problem is that the textured sides of the stand all face the same direction, instead of facing out like the first one we purchased. However this is merely cosmetic, and a nitpick at that."
1,Looks are deceiving,I always trusted Panasonic and thought this would be a nice birthday present for my brother however after having it professionally installed the sound could not be adjusted. So unless you could drive with your ear up next to the speaker it was pretty much useless. I won't trust the seller or panasonic again.
4,Holmes Robot Lamp,"Judging from the reviews I've read, I expected a bit of a hassel setting up this lamp,but no, it was a snap. Some reviews indicated that the bulb would be insufficiant, not in my case. I'm very happy with my choice."
2,wasn't helpful,"this was recommended by my teacher, but because the book was written in all Hebrew, it didn't help me at all"
2,OK Book.,"This book is ok, but as a Rescue worker, I could write stories definitely more inspiring. Short, easy reader though."
2,NOISE! JUST NOISE! ONE GOOD SONG ONLY.,"I first heard Taste of Ink on the radio and said Wow. Who's that? Soon I got to listen to the whole album and was disappointed: Just a bunch of noisy screaming except for one good song ""Taste of Ink"". For noise I would prefer Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Soundgarden, or anything but The Used. Sorry."
3,Good album overall,"The Used is extremely over rated. Don't get me wrong, I think they're a good band and I realy do enjoy this CD. The hype this band gets is annoying though. The countless little girls I had to endure in order to see the movie life, who were opening for the used, is just one example of what a pain hype can be. These songs are no where near poignant enough to be classified as emo, but they are still strong. All in all, it's an album that's entertaining, but nowhere near the genius of bands like cursive or thursday."
1,Im shocked.,"To the braindead reviewer who said ""one of the best rock albums of the year easily"" too bad The used are pop. Using the word rock and this garbage pop band in the one sentance is discraceful."
3,Just passable debut album from The Used,"If you enjoy a lead singer almost yelling into the microphone the lyrics, you should enjoy this CD. I don't like lyrics that are screamed out. However this young Brittish alt rock band shows alot of promise and with two hit songs in the offing on this album 'The Taste Of Ink' and 'A Box Full of Sharp Objects'is passable. The two songs I mentioned were the standout hits and this CD is also enhanced with in studio video clips and a song video clip of 'A Box Full Of Sharp Objects' which wasn't half bad. The rest of the songs are not memorable and most of the lyrics are stressed out by the comical voice of lead vocalist Bert McCraken. This album is for only the hardcore heavy rock fans and those who need moshpit songs for parties and concerts."
4,The Used,"The Used are a very great band that rip down barriers of music and seemingly bounce all over the different genres of Rock and Roll to deliver a powerhouse of a debut that is entertaining from start to finish.From the detailed heartbreaks of ''On My Own'' and ''Buried Myself Alive'' to the grand intensity of ''Maybe Memories,'' this album contains enough variety to impress even the most jaded of music fans.Lyrically the album is a rollercoaster of emotions. Bert is not afraid to let it all loose, and showcases this among the albums songs without sounding phony or pretensious.The album is a landmark in showcasing that a lot of new bands do have talent and will not be ignored for much longer."
5,the BEST new band! no doubt about it!!,"the Used is definitely one of best and most suscessful new band nowadays, the highly energetic and emotional performance of volcalist Bert McCracken, and creative instrumentation make the Used very unique among others, listen to tracks like ""Maybe Memories"", ""Bulimic"", ""Blue And Yellow"", ""Greener With The Scenery"", you'll see how they combine different moods/style from differnet members, break those barrier, and become something really powerful and you'll keep listening over and over again."
2,Used up.,"I would have to say that this cd is not very good. I am myself a wide listener of music and appreciate all kinds of music. However, there were only two things going good for this band on this cd: the song ""taste of ink"" and the lyrics. When I say lyrics, I mean the lyrics for most of the songs, not just ""taste of ink."" Anyway, The Used's lead singer is not even close to being anything good, and at times gets on my nerves. He needs to tone it down some. Some of the songs were decent, but nothing compares to ""Taste of Ink."" That song just made the cd. Buy the singley if they have it out and bypass this cd. It'll save ya 5 or 6 bucks."
2,"The Used, maybe.. their music has been USED before. Ehuh!","So, Bert vomits on stage and while listening to this album I vomit a little inside my mouth. And that my friends is about all I have in common with this album. But, here's the review!I'm giving it a strong two stars for the two songs they got right. Which are Maybe Memories and Box of Sharp Objects. Otherwise this album is one terrible song fallowed by another.Here's one for you, Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence... GlassJAw was here five years ago."
5,AWESOME,The Used is the type of band in which you either love em or hate em... And for most people i hope it is loving them.. Almost every song on this cd would get a perfect rating from me. It's amazing how a band can go from screaming out their lungs to a laid back acoustic song. And that's what makes the used so great. It really shows talent to be able to pull that feat off. If u are into emo/punk u NEED to buy this Cd.. U will never want to stop playing it!!
4,This sounds familiar...,"Now dont get me wrong...I really like this CD but it sounds really really familiar. When I popped it in I swore that I was listening to another band - these guys sound exactly like Thursday, so if you like their latest CD, you'll love The Used."
3,one of the better books,"According to a lot of astrologers this book is one of the better ones. Indeed it is. In this small book Lois Sargent takes a look at how to look for compatibility (attraction, endurability etc..) in horoscopes. In the second part of the book you can find a comparison of aspects. It's a pity that nothing is said about the aspects to the ascendant or midheaven (the most important points in a horoscope!). I do not always agree with the descriptions and this made me think that comparing different horoscopes to compatibility is one of the most difficult and empirical unresearched fields in astrology."
3,"OK, but not great","I found that the cassettes and book started out slowly and well but then became extremely difficult around the 3rd and 4th chapters. For example, in the 3rd lesson on tape, the dialog was taped with a lot of background noise (realistic for the restaurant setting). This makes it very difficult for a beginner to understand the new words! The beginning spent a lot of time on phonemes and the alphabet- both very helpful."
1,Avoid this company!!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
5,Buy,"My husband loved it. I bought it for him for this past Christmas, along with other Kansas City Chief items."
5,I love this cd,I bought this cd because my preschoolers will be singing the world is a. Rainbow for their spring program and I played the cd for them. The totally loved it and thought it was hilarious! All of them wanted to get up and dance around. I recommend this cd for all preschool teachers. I've owned many other CDs with songs for children but they will absolutely LOVE this one!
4,Greeat Children's Music,Great item! My children love the music. Item arrived on time as promised Thank you
1,"Ugh, terrible.","I was trying to find an alternative to the fake, sweet tasting protein powders you find everywhere, this seemed like it would be the answer. The flavor is terrible, the flavor was more artificial than your standard vanilla or chocolate variety. It only takes a little bit to ruin a whole shake."
3,I've never liked this record much,"I'm not a fan of Bill Hardman at all; and there are other versions of ""I Mean You"" and ""Evidence"" recorded by Monk and Blakey that are much better than this. The guys seems to be coasting on this record."
1,This is pathetic filth! DJ Boss Pimp should be banned,"I found this pathetic excuse for music in my son's cd player, and I was totally appalled! This cd has no good messages, no positive songs, nothing but extremely dirty language about group sex and violence. This is x-rated, pornographic dribble. Please people-Don't buy this... you'll only inspire more sickos like Boss Pimp to make more of this garbage. Keep our kids safe from Boss Pimp and his kind!"
2,Elvis Karaoke,"My husband was very disappointed that it was not really Elvis. It was his songs, but not his voice. The Jacket looks like it is an authentic Elvis CD"
5,Evolving,"At first glance, this CD is a simple, underproduced simple pop cd. But as i began to listen to it it began growing on me and all of its little bits and pieces fit together quite coherently. The vocals for the most part are more of a background feature and don't usually stand out too much but that in itself adds to the whole feel of the album. SUGGESTION: listen to the whole album start to finish, don't skip around. Then you will realize how well each song fits into another and you will fall in love the catchy choruses that after a glance are really highly complex and enjoyable.Buy this CD and I think you will find a hidden masterpiece that will blow you away."
5,Perfect Indie/Rock Record,"This is such a terrific cd with great songwriting, urgent vocals and gorgeous sonic variety. Considering it took about five years for these guys to do this album, minus the same amount of effort and time on their next album, its bound to be inferior. But who cares about the future when you've got the perfect indie/rock record to listen to now. Buy it and enjoy!"
2,Avoid the hype,"The words boring, conservative, soulless college / indie rock spring to mind. Overrated as heck...usually by readers of Uncut magazine or Pitchfork. Yuk!"
1,Overrated album of the year,"I usually am a very open-minded person when it comes to music. I could not get past the first listen of this. I bought it with high expectations because of the glowing review from Pitchfork, but my God, its just atrocious. No melody at all, just alot of heavy whining. It sounds no different than the average emo band. I know I'm in the minority here, but please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this."
5,best album ever (at least quite close to being),"I was fortunate enough to get one of the limited edition pre releases, and have been loving this cd for months. seriously, one of the greatest albums ever. among the most touching and true lyrics coupled with incredible, incredible guitar work mixed with beautiful song writing. love this album, worth every penny."
4,A STELLAR review,"If wolves went to ballet, they wouldn't go to Swan Lake, they would go to Swine Lake! We think 4th and 5th graders would like this book because it is more challenging. You should read it a couple times to really understand it and have fun reading it. It's a very good book. It has action in it. We thought it would be rated 4."
3,"Refractometer worked great, did not include every item.","The refractometer worked as it should have, unfortunately the supplier did not include the book that they promised. Overall, it was a fantastic price for just the refractometer."
1,Mine was defective,"I must've gotten a bum unit. The second time I used it, the readings were off by 15 points even after I calibrated, recalibrated, and re-recalibrated the unit several times. The first time I used it, it needed to be calibrated nearly every time I took a reading, even if it was just recalibrated a half hour prior. The little hinge pin for the cover plate isn't secured, either (I'm assuming this is to make cleaning easier), but if you're not careful, it will slide right out and disappear on you. I don't know if they're all like this, but for the money, I think I'll just go back to my hydrometer. Anyway, I contacted the folks at Agriculture Solutions, and returning it is no problem so I'll be sending it back."
3,Pretty funny,"This was a fairly entertaining album as far as ""observational comedy"" albums go. Her jokes are decently fresh, and the album doesn't have much against it until her audience interactions. I feel awkward for some of the people in the audience just listening to it, and it does detract a bit from the rest of the act."
4,"Alright, but not great","To be honest, I would actually give this album 3 1/2 stars, but I'll just round up here. This is a fairly decent album, and has a nice beat throughout the twelve tracks. The two songs that are already singles, ""I Predict A Riot"" and ""Oh My God"", definitely stand out, but the rest of it seems to just be filler.Rolling Stone has said that Kaiser Chief may become the next Beatles, but I see that happening only because of massive publicity and overhyped music. Personally, I didn't hear anything too original, just some rather hackneyed tunes. Enjoyable if you're looking for something to dance to, but there are plenty of better artists out there."
4,Neo New Wave?,"One review I've read of this album describes its sound as ""New Wave revival."" The album's best song, the thundering ""I Predict a Riot"" is the Clash meets Supergrass; a great song. Outside of that, this very British sounding album borrows -- seemingly accidentally -- more for Brit Pop pioneers The La's than it does any New Wave band. There are hints of early Blur throughout the album. ""Time Honoured Tradition"" sounds lifted right off the Kinks' classic, Village Green Preservation Society.While there is nothing startlingly original about Employment, it has a great sound, energy and overall feel. Rare is it that I can listen to an album once through and ""get it"" immediately, but Employment is one of those rarities. Put this on your Christmas list."
4,Good energy...good fun...good music,"There are a stack of bands you hear when you play the album, The Clash, The Damned, Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, even a bit of The Specials. All very urban and brit, with a good sence of humor. Sure, it would be fantastic if every band could be 100% fresh, but that dont happen much. On the whole a good album - worth buying and one of the better releases in the last 12 months.Remember - its only Rock and Roll - enjoy it."
5,'OH MY GOD' this album is awesome,"This cd is amazing, evokes 80's british invasion bands yet it's completeley original and fresh. v.promising. buy it now!"
3,A worthwhile debut.,"The Kaiser Chiefs join the recent trend of alterna-pop bands (Futureheads, Dogs Die in Hot Cars) looking to fill the void left in the wake of XTC's long hibernation. Like Dogs Die..., the Chiefs pull out a fun, if somewhat lacking attempt at cannabalising the various aspects of Andy Partridge's sound. The end result is a thoroughly listenable if somewhat lackluster affair peppered by a few excellent songs (I Predict a Riot, Oh My God, Saturday Night, and perhaps Everyday I Love You Less and Less) surrounded by several tracks that are forgotten as soon as they are heard. It won't become your favorite CD of the year, but it's certainly worth a listen. 3 1/2 stars."
2,The Stones are better than this...,"Forget this video, check out the Voodoo Lounge or Bridges to Babylon videos. They're excellent, this one's only fair. But Stones fanatics will buy it anyway because it's the last one with Bill Wyman playing bass."
1,Poor Product,"After only a few uses of beating egg whites, our beater came apart in our hands and sadly we can use it no more. Looking into returning it, but always a hassle."
2,Heathers this ain't,"At first veiwing, I thought this would be a dark comedy, and it starts like one: death of a long-time friend first evokes panic, then is replaced by an almost callous attitude ( as seen in the high school bathroom ) and eventually deception and betrayal follow. The bright settings and clothes are a stark contrast to their grim deed, and Rose Mcdowell plays her role wonderfully. Unfortunatley the plot soon turns ho-hum as the movie progresses, losing it's scathing humour and becoming cliched in its ""thwarting the evil ploys"" of Mcdowell. Also, there were numerous plot holes in the movie, especially concerning the ""crime scene"" and the police' acquiring of the suspect. I guess the only comparison to this movie would be Heathers, which far out shines this pale copy."
1,Save yourself,"This was one of the five worst movies I have ever seen. It was gross, attempted to be artsy fartsy, and frighteningly strange at some parts. After I got done watching the movie I wanted to take a shower and pray the rosery to cleanse both my body and soul. It sucked."
4,...........perfect funny movie!,this is a kind of movie u could watch every day in fact it is very funny and well made. the actors are very good and rose mcgowan is perfect in her part. there are no boring scenes and everything is ok. anyway it isn't a kolossal or something like that...a commedy that works and that will make u laugh 'til the end! i can't give it 5 stars because the performance of the characters isn't perfect but still good. watch it and buy it! believe me..
5,fantastic teen comedy send-up!,"JAWBREAKER is a fantastic homage to the classic horror films of the 70's and cult high school films of the 60's.Three bitchy teen queens (Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Julie Benz) are thrown into a frenzy when a birthday prank backfires and they accidentally kill a close friend, a jawbreaker mercilessly lodged in her throat.Enter the hopelessly dorky Fern Mayo (Judy Greer) who stumbles onto the real reason behind the mysterious death. The girls have no option but to win the girl's silence, and include her in their circle of elite, but not before changing her image and her name...to Violette.Featuring veteran comedienne Carol Kane and legendary ""blaxploitation"" star Pam Grier, JAWBREAKER is a superb film, written and directed by the talented Darren Stein.The DVD includes director's commentary, interviews and behind-the-scenes, music video ""Yoo Hoo"" by Imperial Teen and the trailer."
1,terrible terrible movie,"Even if you are in to the teeny-boper movies, you may not like this one. I was 16 when I rented it and I almost couldn't finish it. I don't know if I did. My boyfriend was even a little irratated that I'd ruined his evening by picking out such a lame movie. WASTE OF TIME! Only buy this movie as a gift for someone whose seen it and already really enjoys it or if you've seen it and like it."
1,Pam Grier......What were you thinking?!?,"The only justifiable and redeemable quality of this movie that is worth mentioning is that Pam Grier has a supporting role in it. Although her character was written as 2 dimentional and left no room for any depth or development, she did give an almost ""oscar-worthy"" performance when she slammed the jawbreaker on the table while trying to intimidate one of the girls. You go Pam! I watched in discomfort as Pam (who so brilliantly played ""Jackie"" in ""Jackie Brown"") tried to no avail to bring her lame character to life. I only saw the boredom in her eyes. The entire time i viewed this piece, i wanted to take over for the director and do this film some justice. There were so many opportunities to make this movie work but it seems as though the filmmakers had a creative blockage holding them back. A jawbreaker maybe?"
5,Product Review,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out. And with Rose McGowan being my favorite actress, this movie was a must have!"
2,one for road should never have been released.,"Scarub is going to lose a few fans with this one. The production is really sad compared to any previous releases. He is so talented, but his production really needs to be kept off albums. I also felt that this album lacked the heart and soul of all other Scarub releases. If you really love Scarub's lyrical style, you might enjoy this album. The lyrics are fast, witty, and tasteful. But if you don't want to hear song's that are not good enough to make a real Scarub album, don't bother with this one."
1,Poor customer service,"Paragon sports sent me the wrong color. They are making me ship these back and waiting until they process this as an ""exchange"" before they send out the correct items that I ordered. Very poor customer service. I will not order from Paragon Sports again."
3,Just an average read for me,"I had some great expectations going into this one from all of the reviews. However, I found this book moved too slowly and I found myself bored many times. There was too much thinking and not enough dialogue in the beginning as well. I liked the characters and the story was a pretty good idea. I just think it could have been much better - probably with better editing...too much off plot unnecessary occurrences. Also, it really got on my nerves when it got into the necessary declarations of love...""hmmm, can he really love me if he doesn't say it exactly as I want him to using my preconceived script?"" I just see that too much in these books...lazy way too many authors use to separate and then finally bring the couple together emotionally."
5,I'm addicted to them!,"BEWARE! These are highly addictive! I became obsessed with them on a trip to Scotland. The chocolate is wonderful- not that waxy coating you'd find on US malted milk balls. It is real, sweet, creamy chocolate, and the malted milk centers are to die for!"
1,uncomfortable clogs,I had such high hopes when I ordered this thong. I read the Amazon product description and it made this footwear seems so comfortable. The only thing right about it is that it is lightweight. The insole was so hard and it didn't feel like it had any support at all. My feet ached after only a few minutes of wearing it. What a complete waste of money.
4,Nice,The Celtic Irish Crosses I purchased from Amazon are what I expected. Nice and the same as pictured. I would recommend this necklace to anyone who wishes to show their Celtic heritage.
4,Product Review,"Cute backpack that is a good size for a toddler. I brought this backpack for a Halloween costume, but you can use this backpack to take small toys or snacks."
3,Know the good and bad aspects of GPS before you go!,"GPS is of limited usefulness in the backcountry, due to a number of different factors. Satellites, receivers, cartography and users act as a system to make navigation easier and safer. Each part of that system has its weaknesses. This book is a good way to learn all you can about GPS, before you rely on one in the backcountry."
4,Don't Use Your Head,"...Just go with it! The premise in a nutshell is simple. Mom takes a much needed vacation in Australia... Apart from her kiddies and rather than trust her 17 year old daughter to tend to the little ones she hires a babysitter to watch them while she is away for three months (More a sabbatical then vacation, Mom). Once Mom is out of the picture the sitter goes militant and the kiddies dreams are turned to jagged, shattered nightmares. But then the kiddies find out the babysitter's dead and a free-for-all begins! But soon play-day turns to payday when they find out the sitter had the money to care for then on her when they dumped her at the funeral home and Sue Ellen must get a job. Buy this Christina Applegate classic and find out!"
4,Good Movie,"I'm an adult and I love this movie. I don't understand why TV Guide gives it only one star. It deserves more than that.Mom is going to Australia for the summer and the kids are being left home with a babysitter, a kindly woman, but old. Well, she dies on the kids and they cart her body off to the funeral home and plot how to get along without telling Mom. Suellen (Christina Applegate) decides to get a job so the kids can have a summer on their own. This is when the fun really begins. Suellen applies for a receptionist job but winds up being hired as an executive assistant to Rose, played by Joanna Cassidy, in the garment industry.We watch Suellen go from typical blonde teenager to mature keeper of her younger siblings and their well-being. We have fun along the way on her journey. If only life could throw all of us such a great boss, great opportunity, great good luck, and a big adventure. This is a very good movie."
1,What a horrible family!,"My god this movie stinks. Not to mention it comes on a lot on HBO and it gets old. Don't waste your time. Home Alone is lots better than watching this crap. It's just about a couple of kids who gets babysitted by an old lady who looks 100 and she dies and they all decide to take the house for themselves. It's stupid, cheesy, and acting sucks. Stay away from this bad movie."
3,Unexpectedly good.,"I am not usually a fan of Ms. Applegate's work, and was leery when this movie came out, but I actually wound up liking it a lot.When the babysitter dies, a young (formerly spoiled) teen girl grows up and climbs her way up the career ladder. Armed with an imaginary resume (and great clothes), she rescues an ailing apparel company and even manages to keep her sibblings from killing each other.Despite a weak plot and a too rapid chain of events (this film will never join any good ""classic videos"" collection) that make everything too convient, this is a good movie for generation X. It excellently captures the tense emotions many young people feel in their first ""real world"" job while showing that the people well entrenched in this world are not exactly as smart as they would like to appear."
2,State of Trance 2004 is so much better!,"Ever since I listened to State of Trance 2004, I was rather disappointed with this one. I am a pure trance fan who is not into background female vocals mixed in. Thus CD1 was not for me. CD2 is darker, but not interesting enough. I own more than 200 trance CDs and some of my favs are Paul Oakenfold's Transport 1 (my Oakie's fav), Paul Van Dyk's Out There And Back (PVD's best work), Seb Fontaine's Prototype Series (One of my fav trance DJs), and Tiesto's Magik Series. You can't go wrong with any of these. These are some of cream of the crop trance!"
2,mom of player,Not what I was looking for. A little to dry. I liked some of the other books I bought better.
5,very cute,"we bought this for our son for halloween this year. very cute..pants were too long, so we had to hem those. he got a lot of compliments at the mall. very unique."
2,In Love With Julia's Face?,"A stunning John Malkovitch can't even get this movie off the ground! Julia Roberts gives a fine, nuanced performance as a Victorian woman scarred by neglect and harsh work, but the director can't get away from close shots of Julia's face to give us a clear view of the action. Malkovitch is his usual superb, dangerous self, but he is crippled by the director's obsession with Julia's visage. The book is worth a lot more,the movie is only useful as background noise for a game of Scrabble. Better luck next time, Julia!"
4,Fantastic film but not for Julia.,"Another remake of classic Jeckyl & Hyde story. Now from the point of view of the maid, Mary Reilly. This is well made movie but it performed badly in the box office. I believe this is the worst performing (box office wise) in Julia Roberts career. I really don't think this is the right part for her. The rest of the casts are wonderful. John Malkovich is excellent as both Jecky & Hyde. Glenn Close has supporting role. The DVD is quite good. Picture is sharp & clear despite a lot of the movie took place in the dark. The Dolby 5.0 is OK, why they don't add the .1 for the subwoofer channel is beyond me. But if you like the Jeckyl Hyde story, this DVD will not disappoint you."
1,"If negative stars were a rating option, I would use them","This movie had an interesting idea going for it in the beginning, but the bad acting, bad script, bad lighting, and horrible accents, killed it. I feel I lost brain cells just watching it. The only ""scary"" or ""disturbing"" part was Malkovich's face, which hardly ever changed into a believable expression. Robert's accent changed from scene to scene with upsetting regularity, which was extremely disappointing.If the point of this movie was to show how ""misunderstood"" Jeckyl and Hyde may have been, it did a thoroughly awful job.I would recommend a root canal over this movie, as it may be less painful."
3,"""Downstirrs, Upstirrs . . . . in my lady's chamber .....""","This is a strange, grotesque vision of the Jekyll Household seen through so haunted eyes of Julia Roberts as the lowly help, [give or take a few problems of her own].Fog in the throat? Yes, most definately a complex picture of the doomed doctor's household and staff. This IS a mood piece par excellence, with a DY-NO-MITE Hyde-Jekyll Transformation sequence, very unusual and so different from the, effective though they are, earlier Barrymore/Tracy/March versions. It leaves you with that queasy feeling. Malkovich is suitably shrill as the doctor in distress. Glenn Close? Always stalwart as the crimson-lipped Madame.It is Miss Julia who impresses most with her ultra-vulnerability - a perfect realization of this girl. ..."
4,added to my daughters bike,This adds a feminine touch to my daughters new bike we got her. She loves having the pom pom and a basket on her bikes and this goes perfect with her purple bike. I did think the material was going to be more shiney and was just slightly disappointed that they were a matte finish...so maybe in the future add in the discription about the material.
4,Helped this Yankee,"After I read this, I read 'The Help"". The two have helped me to see I was not totally crazy about how I viewed my new neighbors. I have to admit it has helped me to see why they are the way they are, please do not miss understand me, I am the one who is out of place here in the South, not them. However in another 50 years or so, prayfully it will have all been bred out, and they will join the rest of the United States, and see what a beautiful country we have when we are United. I reccomend BOTH books to be a part of the Southern School curriculum Mary Chestnuts book is FANTASTIC, The Help, just adds a little 'color'. (I just added that for 'The pun of it')Yes I have been in the south 1 day to long..and have completly departed from reality ='("
4,Evil exists ... but not where you think!,"A bravo performance by the great Sean Connery, plus a fairly imaginative storyline, saves this one from mediocrity. The supporting cast is not bad, although you really never get to know them much. You may think that you see where this one is going, but there are surprises.A young black man is on death row for a murder that he maintains he did not commit. Connery plays a liberal, anti-death penalty law professor who gets talked into trying for a new appeal in the case. Turns out that the convict was indeed beaten and coerced into making his confession in what was otherwise a fairly thin case against him. But all is not what it seems, and more would be telling. This one held my interest throughout. It has a somewhat strange moral message if you want to call it that.One of the better suspense/murder films out there. This one is worth a try, especially for Sean Connery fans."
5,Romantic and adventurous,"I enjoyed the family's adventure. This story makes me want to go and live there, would love to replicate the adventure.This family obvously loved Africa.Looking forward to the next book, hopefully with the continuing story."
5,WWE No mercy 2002,Very happy. My order shipped right away. Great service. I will do more business with this company in the future.
3,mmmmmmm...It's Okay!,"I dont know about this movie. It just doesn't do it for me. Usually, I get really into a movie with its action, plot, audio and video quality. I only got the action, and audio and video quality. At one point, I was not interested on finishing watching the movie. The casts were good but the movie could have been better. The DVD has a lot of features. Behind the scenes of the movie was really interesting. There was no need for that short film to be included. It was boring!"
5,i liked Chris Tukers act he's a great actor. he leaves me wi,"i liked the way Chris Tuker acts he's cool he's funky he leaves me in lauhgter., later"
4,You'll Get A Rush Of Laughter,"The paring of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker was indeed a good match. These guys feed off of each other very well. Some racial overtones, but it is all in jest. The story has a few holes in it but the focus is more on Chan and Tucker. Tucker really brightens up the screen with his personality and antics. Give it a try."
5,Funny and action filled,"Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan have onscreen chemistry that shines in this film. Tucker is the fool, with Chan alternating between being the straight man to his antics...like a Laurel and Hardy for the new generation.Granted, this film wont win any points for originality as neither the plot, nor any of the gags are original, but Chan and Tucker infuse the movie with pure fun.Chris Tucker is typecast for life, due to his high pitched voice and need to nearly scream every line in every movie he makes, but his character in this film is custom made to fit that personality.Jackie Chan delivers with his usual combination of Brce Lee meets Buster Keaton formula that always makes his movies good clean fun.So if youre looking for a great Hollywood style actioner with Honk Kong style thrills, then this is the movie for you!"
3,used Rush Hour DVD,"packaging could have been a lot better, disc was intact but case was smashed when it arrived."
2,Bad.,The only thing better about this than Jackie Chan's other films is that it is'nt horribly dubbed.Everything else is poor.The story is lacklustre and the chemistry between him and Chris Tucker is laughable in itself.Avoid.
1,POOR ACTING BY CAST,BOTH JACKIE CHAN AND CHRIS TUCKER DID A PITYFUL JOB ACTING IN THIS MOVIE. IT FAILS TO DEVELOP A PLOT AND IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL.
1,Successful garbage that inflicted Brett Ratner on the world,"I don't know why I bought this DVD. I didn't like the movie, I must have been out of my mind. It just proves that Hollywood is so out of imagination and ideas it has to recycle dated movie genres from years ago (the buddy cop flick) to make a few hundred million more dollars. And do you know what? We fall for it! This movie made a tonne of cash. God only knows why. Tucker is as irritating here as he was in Fifth Element, which was VERY irritating indeed. There is no real plot worth mentioning. The ending is the usual bad-guy's-suitcase-full-off-money-rains-down-on-hero junk too.Please save your money. Don't buy this and don't listen to the other reviews. I'm telling you the truth."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny","This movie is too funny!!! Chris Tucker(who is so sexy) steals the show. Chris and Jackie Chan are such a great duo they will have you crying from the great on screen chemistry they share. Not only is there laughter, but there is also alot of action. The action in this movie is good. A great movie to have in your possession."
5,Very nice,"This sticker is great. Amazing condition, fast delivery. I gave this as a gift and my friend loved it. I saw it after he applied to his guitar ampifier and it looks like he bought it with the decal already on it. Perfect. Thank you!"
3,ending? What ending?,"I just caught the end of the movie(10-15 minutes) and HAD decided to rent the whole thing....then the ending. Now, I'm in Japan and watching it on Japanese television and was wondering if maybe they cut it off or not...but after reading the revies, I didn't miss a thing....was thinking about renting it, but maybe not now..."
1,HORRIBLE ! THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN !,"I can't believe this director made such a lousy movie. The characters are ridiculous, the plot is almost non-existant, the ending is absurd, as if it was calling the spectator a dumb ! The cover art of the box is fooling the audience, because there's no action at all."
5,Great,these are 2 great Clint Eastwood movies. he delivers a totally awesome preformance. These are a must see for any Clint Eastwood fan.
1,kelly heros/ where eagles dare,I bought several movies over the last few days in hopes to be able to play them in my Blu-Ray player however when I got them and placed them into the player the player said that it could not read the disc on either movie so i was very disppointed in not being able to watch the movies. I wondered if any one else had this issue happen to them with these movies. I will try to find thme around here and hope they play better than these did.
5,great book,this book is great for beginners who want to have a beautiful garden. lots of tips. easy to follow and to understand.
5,Great album better than many albums today.,I to say this was great album by the late great talented Robert Byrne it was a classic album make me miss the 70's when artist made music from the heart. Make me miss when artist cared about making good music.
3,Just a routine,"I was hoping that some of his classic routines would be on this CD, which is only described as track 1 and 2. I would LOVE to hear Chris Columbus discovering America, Geraldine, etc. But apparently unless I'm willing to pay for vinyl to be converted for $50 [I don't want to hear it THAT much], my wish will remain a wish."
2,I hate this thing,I bought this new in 2008 and it worked ok for the first three years but it has become very problematic the last two. I would only recommend this stove to people who enjoy trying to figure out why their appliances don't work. I don't know if there are better brands but I should hope that there aren't any worse ones.
5,Finally!,"I finally took the plunge and bought myself a tablesaw after thinking about it for years. After much comparison, I went with the Supersaw. The features and pricing were right in my range, and the free delivery from Amazon sealed it (no tax too!). The sliding table works like a dream, however I agree with others observation that you really need a friend to help get it in place (URGH!). Saw was dead-on accurate out of the box, and needed no further adjusting from me- a pleasant surprise.I can't imagine spending more cash for other comparable saws- Jet has 'em licked here.One thing to consider: If you are getting the saw delivered to your residence, you should call the carrier to ask for a truck with a lift- they almost sent mine on a semi- and I don't own a forklift to unload it!"
3,Disappointed,He pretty much covers the absolute basics and shows about 3 films that come with the 8th habit book. I really felt this was more of a commercial to by the book that was a bit too brief. I really love his principles and tell everyone about this books. (Especially 7th and 8th Habit)I don't think I would have purchased had I realized the lack of depth and the shortness of the film.
2,A disappointing first introduction to Ed Abbey,"This was my first introduction to the well known author, Edward Abbey. My impression was that Abbey wrote with a strong environmental voice and was an advocate of wildlands. Instead, I read about a man who kicks animals that don't get out of his way, who drags trashed cars through the Australian outback, who tosses his empty wine bottles into remote canyons,and who expresses a superior attitude to just about everybody. His writing style is highly variable, ranging from sophomoric (usually) to pure Americana (very occasionally). When he hits the latter, he can rival Mark Twain, which is probably why he enjoys the reputation he does. However, this reputation obviously wasn't made with the essays contained in this anthology. Folks looking for an introduction to Abbey are advised to try another book."
3,"Abbey is great, but this collection is not his best","Do not let this book be your introduction to Edward Abbey. There is plenty of brilliance here, but an established fan will be able to appreciate that brilliance best."
4,Hand Grip,The hand grip has helped me have a better grip. I have developed arthritis in my little fingers. Using the hand grip has helped the swelling to stop and have less pain. I keep it in my car and use it when I am at a stop light. Now I want the light to be red.
4,Good Grip,There are probably better hand grips but this one is good. The padding helps you keep your grip if you start to sweat. And the resistance is adequate.
3,Men of war,"I thought this was a typical Dolph Lungren movie; plenty of action,with a bonus, a couple of Hot chicks, Catherine Bell, and Charlotte Lewis. Not Bad."
5,"Chumbawamba wrote it , must be worth it","Chumbawamba has a great sound and taste in music, Shhh is a great album with fun beats and serious yet enjoyable tracks, you don't have to compare their other work to judge this album, Shhh is an album Chumbawamba produced, they took their time to put out a record people should listen to, this album contains great lyrics and has sweet music , if you are open to any kind of music, Shhh is an album that contains sweet music, Even though i'm a nobody, I loved this album, you should give this CD a try."
3,Average Chumbawamba CD,"Just average, not one of their best.Anarchy, WYSIWYG, Tubthumper and Readymades are much better. I like Chumbawamba's music a lot and I kept listening to all of them the last few months. I've recently bought Shhh and I think I could easily forget about it.Not bad but you won't miss anything by not listening to it."
5,A Chapter book you can finish in one sitting!,"Our 8 year old son LOVES the Black Lagoon Adventure series, and this book was just as funny and fun for him as the others he's read! He's constantly stopping his silent reading to shout out something clever or funny from the book! Language and content are very easy to follow...we definitely recommend all of these books in this series! (I believe there are 11 in all)"
4,American composer,An American composer who is one of my favoites. His works; especially his rythums are refreshing and easy to listen to and very entertaining. The Symphonies are arrangements by Richard Rosenberg and the Hot Springs Festival Symphony Orchestra are well performed.
3,Problems with reading old English,"Reading this is very interesting and informative. The problem is that being written in the style of it's day it is like reading Socrates: You know the arguments that go around and around the same circle over and over and over until you get back to the beginning of the argument. When if one were Aristotle, you could have written this whole book in forty pages."
1,Two treatise of government,I think this book is good but it lacks being able to keep my attention and I have read huge books. If it kept my attention for a little bit longer than the first page I would keep reading it.
3,No answer key?,This is a decent algebra 2 workbook but I don't recommend it because there is no answer key.
1,cheapest paper possible,"This book is written on the cheapest possible paper. It makes you afraid to try to turn a page & uninviting to use. A lot of math example problems have no answers given - so how do you learn from them, anyway."
3,OK condition Algebra II book,"This is the kind of textbook student would use in schools when studying Algebra II. The way it is organized and material presented is easy for students to use.It is in an OK condition.Overall, I am satisfied."
1,Not the real Cerebral Corps,"I've been looking for this album for a while so I was very excited- then disappointed- to find that what is advertised is not what is shown. I don't know if the real CD is what you'd get if you order this item, but I know the album picture and tracklist aren't the real thing. Even a close look at the album picture will make this obvious as you can fairly well make out the title ""Dog Food"" on it. I, for one, will not take the risk of ordering the CD with this false information. For the actual album and tracklist go to Allmusic.com."
3,Good introduction but pricey,"Good, clear introduction to systems thinking but there are much better values out there (eg Systems Thinking: Managing Chaos and Compexity or Peter Senge's books). Would be useful in a seminar or classroom setting but I have to say I was very disappointed when it arrived (at that time the page information was not listed on Amazon). Maybe if it was packaged with some of the other systems thinking booklets produced by Pegasus I would have been more satisfied. If you are really interested in the topic ... is a very good resource."
3,Good Fun on a Rainy Sunday Afternoon,"This certainly is not a 5 Star movie, but it is fun and highly watchable. I think any DVD collection would be made more complete with a copy of this film. Fraser is very good in this movie and carries the whole thing. Without his acting abilities, I dare say this film would be a 1-Star wonder. Silverstone is fine but I think a better choice would be someone a little bit older. She is difficult to imagine in this role as it feels like it was written for someone 10 years older. This film to me is like ""comfort food""....something that makes you feel at home like meatloaf and mashed potatoes. When I am feeling harried from the work week, this film is a guilty pleasure to fall back on. It is NOT great, but it is delightfully comfortable."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"View this movie as soon as you receive it. We waited until months later and it skips all over the place at the beginning and at the end. Tried it in different players, as well as my PC with no success. It made my Windows Media Player crash. I thought although it's new, maybe it has something on the back causing it to stick. When we tilted it to the light, there are tons of little circle blemishes all over it. Too late to return. Please view your movies within the return date."
1,fun premise poorly executed,"The premise of this movie was interesting, but instead of exploring the many comedic possibilities of a stuck-in-the-50's family navigating the 1990's (and the potentially rich sub-plot of the archbishop and the cult that developed around the elevator) it languished in the tired old formula of feisty girl meets boy, girl plays hard to get because she can't understand it was love at first sight and HE'S the man she's waited for all along, yawn yawn yawn. And Alicia Silverstone...somebody please get that girl some acting lessons!Watched this one only because I had the flu and was too tired to do much else. Besides, it was on TV so it didn't cost me anything except my time."
4,A feel good flick!,"I owned this in the VHS format, and was thrilled to purchase it when it came out on DVD. It is among my favorites, I watch it over and over. I like movies without tons of foul language, and obvious sex. It is cute and simple, and leaves you with a good feeling - something that too many movies today don't do. If you are looking for an elaborate plot, lots of bells and whistles, this one is not for you. It is more of a chick flick, than a guys film."
5,Well written comedy,"Blast from the Past is a hilarious comedy about something many of us remember - what to do in the case of a nuclear attack!The writing is great, the acting is so appropriate, and the characters are well-developed and interesting. I especially appreciated the fact that the writer used wit as humor, instead of foul language to keep the watcher engaged. I feel this is a movie that a family could watch together."
5,A wonderful Blast from the Past,"This movie is one of my classic favorites. Anytime I say ""write that down"", I think of it. It is funny, a little romantic and hopeful. Sure, it follows the regular recipe for romantic comedy, but the twist adds to the fun and the cast can't be beat!!"
4,Great Movie,"I love this movie, it is sweet and I didn't have to worry about my kids watching it. It shows that old fashioned values can exist in todays world and that movies do not have to be scary and gross and full of sex and violence and vulgar language to be a good movie. I wish they would make more!"
3,Not as engaging as I had hoped ...,"I actually plunked down the cold, hard cash for this DVD before I had even seen it, based on the generally favorable reviews. Although there were a few good laughs, the time between their delivery was substantial. Twenty minutes could have been shaved off the running time if the story had been tightened up a bit, and a better film would have been achieved in the process. The acting was generally pretty good, with the exception of Silverstone's performance. Perhaps her character was miscast, but whatever the reason, her whining and belly-aching was a bit over the top and wore thin real fast. The similarly-themed film ""Pleasantville"", which is about modern kids transporting back to the fifties, is a much better movie than this."
2,"Funny but, hey, not the best.","Story of a couple (Christopher Walken, Sissy Spaceck) who, in 1963 go into a HUGE bomb shelter to hide from nuclear bombs, but their really weren't any. Thirty five years later their son (Brendan Fraser)goes out into the REAL world and meets a very beautiful girl (Alicia Silverstone) and her gay friend Troy (Dave Foley). Some parts are funny, some parts lag. Christopher Walken and Dave Foley are what makes this movie very funny, especially Walken. I liked it alot but, hey, just not may favorite."
3,Oh my god...@_@,"Ok, this has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen... Come on, opening lines like ""Oh my lucky stars, a negro!"" and ""I've seem to have dropped my Congressional medal of honor"". Oh please. I've heard better opening lines in Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy. (By the way, Dave Foley is also in that one. ^_^) I'm probably rent it for my friend, because he likes the lines ""Don't touch my elevator"" and ""I come in peace"". Me? I'll rent it because of Dave Foley."
4,"A fun, uplifting family comedy","I'm no huge fan of Alicia Silverstone and am nearly always annoyed by Brendan Fraiser, but I saw Blast From the Past on a recommendation from a website I've been reading for years. I enjoyed it greatly, and have since watched again with most of my family.Though it isn't the funniest or the most exciting film you'll ever see, Blast From the Past is quality entertainment for anyone and everyone. It centers on a silly premise, but the underlying themes are important and uplifting. A strongly recommended romantic comedy!"
4,Really a fun movie,Going back in time to the 50's is always fun and enjoyed the innocence of the era depicted! This one is a great movie for lot's of laughter!
3,preppers unite,"Great concept for a movie in light of the popularity of doomsday prepping...except this movie was made prior to the latest ""fad."". Not as many laughs as I expected, but another great performance from Sissy Spacek."
5,Bucket list entry - A TOWN LIKE ALICE DVD,"I have tried everywhere to get A TOWN LIKE ALICE on DVD, I did get two pirated copies which were unwatchable from a site somehow illegally linked to Amazon, so be careful-you can't get hold of them after you send your money. If this came out in Australia on DVD, why isn't it available in the USA? I LOVE THIS FANTASTIC STORY it is so real I felt like I had walked the length of Malaya, even the music is poignant. Vivien"
2,A Town Like Alice,"I read this some years ago and finally found the film. It's a brilliantly true story and I strongly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, in that the movie must have been made for TV and very difficult to understand the dialects. The film needs to be remastered and possibly sub-titled. The acting is superb!"
2,"Poor production quality, low resolution","In light of the high-quality 2004 DVD (""ConnQuest,"" which included a tournament recap AND both the semi-final and final game in their entirety), this championship video falls far short. The production quality is poor in my opinion: too many player/coach interviews spliced amongst game highlights, inadequate narrative recaps of key games, and even a resolution so low that it didn't fit the full screen of my puny 32"" TV. I'm guessing the quality is so low because the producers (IMG, not one of the networks) could not obtain all the necessary footage rights (the NCAA now sells full games from their website which explains why that is absent this time around). Very disappointing. In fact, there was a cheesy DVD produced in 2004 as well entitled ""Top Dogs"" and this vid is much closer to that than it is to ConnQuest."
2,It's cheap for a reason,"There is a reason this is under $50.00. If you don't mind some scratches, dings, and missing hardware this is your product. Otherwise, I recommend going with something else. It arrived with the packaging open on the ends and the parts are in the box loose so they are scuffed from rattling around. The connector plate on one of the supports was bent so it took some muscle to bend it in place. Finally the hardware was missing and rather than increase my frustration I went to the local hardware store and purchased my own for another $7.00. Other than that it appears to hold my 300lb Olympic set just fine."
5,Very nice stand,"I am very happy with this stand. It's exactly what I needed. It is sturdy and doesn't take up a lot of space. Word of caution to you home gym users: This is for OLYMPIC weights, which have bigger holes than some other home weight sets, so make sure you're buying the right thing. But it's exactly what I needed and works great!"
1,6 names,"I really did not like this book.I did not like this book because it started with people chasing kids.misha,stopthef stole a peace of bread.Then he got snatch up by a gang of kids who smoke,drank and cuss.Then it went to people having to go under the wall just to get food.The people that went to get it was a kid called misha,and stopthef.he was the one to get snatched up by the gang that smoke,and drank.Then it ended with dead people on the sidewalk and the gold angel going to get them.I do not recomend to anyone at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.."
4,Milkweed Book Review,"Milkweed was an amazing book by Jerry Spinelli. My favorite book of all. It had description anda lot of interesting facts about World War II. It had Misha running from the Germans, to stealing food, then to leaving the ghetto and sneaking back in. He encountered lot's of thing's but one of the things I hated most was when Heinrik was hung with a sign that said ""I'm a smuggler"" this was a very good read."
2,Avoid This Box Set! Great Songs horrible idea,I ordered this because I love most of Robbie Williams songs and this box set containes 19 chart hits across 19 individual CD singles. What a waste! I think the outer packaging is excellent but who wants to change a cd after every song??I recommend the Asian edition...much better.
5,Modern Jazz with a beat,"This is one of those rare albums that's like a great novel you can't put down. When you are listening to the radio, there are certain songs that when you hear them you have to turn them up. This is true for almost every cut on this awesome albumn."
1,I don't think The Darkness should land anywhere!!!,"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard!!! I love frontmen who can reach high notes (think GN'R, the VERY LAST GOOD North American band) but these high notes make my ears bleed. I would not recommend this album to anyone, anywhere, anytime. It is because of artists(?) like this one (and Rap, HipHop & Pop too!) that I quit listening to the radio and started buying and listening to awesome European melodic power metal bands with frontmen who can reach high notes and not make you want to scream out in agony because your ears are bleeding."
3,I love it.,"Bought the album last week. ""Love Is Only A Feeling"" is probably the best track on the cd. I like the whole album, I don't really have a problem with it."
2,"Please Go Away, Now.","After spending a few weeks in Europe, I was constantly forced to listent to this. The Darkness, a band, or a joke, im not quite sure which, is currently the hottest thing in England and much of surrounding western Europe. Their music which can only be explained as some kind of operatic, 80's hair band pap. I remember thinking to myself, everytime this would come on (and believe me, it's everywhere -- MTV, radio,etc), why does this exist? Why are they doing this to me?So, back home in the U.S. Luckily, nowadays, I can fire up my computer and have the whole album in my hands in a matter of minutes. Because, god knows, im certainly not going to entertain buying this, but I had to know, what is the rest of it like? Maybe it will be good?Nope.It's horrible. Im sorry, i know a lot of you love it, but why? Musically, it's not bad. But that voice, that awful, awful voice. If this breaks in america, all of my fears will have been answered. We really are dumb."
4,"Another Great ""Rock"" Debut...","After Rock Bands Such As: Van Halen, The Cars, Velvet Revolver, Guns N' Roses and Many More Debuted with all star debut albums...this is another must own debut that is outstanding.PROS:The Album Has A Strong First 5 Tracks, and overall is a well balanced album with strong songs that reference us back to the era where Rock n' Roll ruled America.The Band Sounds Tight and Professional. Makes Rock N' Roll Sound Fun Again.CONS:Although The Album Is Nearly Perfect. It's Misses With Only a couple of fillers that ruin this to be a perfect release. songs like ""Stuck In A Rut"" ""Givin Up"" and ""Holding On My Own"" Pretty Much Could've Been Changed Up With A Couple Of More Hard Hitting Songs.Overall, This Is A Great Debut From a Once Great Rock Band That Should Return."
2,The real growing darkness is a hair metal comeback,"Commercial retro garbage from a flash-in-the-pan set of musicians who formed the band at a KAROKE SESSION when the lead singer capably sung a Queen number. These guys are like the retro Monkees, the music is so predictable and derivative that it's already trite, and the ideals of the music they espouse are so culturally backward that it's almost offensive that they're presuming to reintroduce them to the public. Go buy a reissued G n' R CD, or look up Judas Priest, or pop in your old Queen cassette, but avoid these guys like the plague.The two stars are for their capable musicianship, or should I say adept aping."
3,not horrible,"the darkness are no queen, but who is? this is not to bad, at least they have decent guitar solos and song writing. the new great band? probably not, we'll see what they do on their next album, at least their better than the 90's grunge movement."
4,"Infectious, gripping, homage to the 70's and 80's!!","IT must hav been a British band to accomplish all that! This album will grip you by the ba..ls, with it's high pitched (but in control) vocals, his steady rhythm line, his infectious guitar.It's a short album by today's standards (38 minutes), but each one of they count."
4,jumping jesus on a pogo stick.,"I was blown away by this album. Stuff like ""I Believe In A Thing Called Love"" is the stuff that makes you want to laugh and dance and sing and puke at the same time. It's that great. ""Givin' Up"" is one of the funniest songs I have ever heard...after reading the lyrics I had to contain my laughter. The only thing is the few weak tracks, like ""Holding my Own"". Still, it's rounded out by ones like ""Black Shuck"". The irony in their lyrics is hilarious (at least, to those of us who can see it). My advice? Pick it up. NOW."
4,Rock music lives again...,"The Darkness is perhaps the start of the rennaisance of rock music, it sounds like the rock music of old (or at least the 70s and 80s), when it wasn't particularly whiney and all the songs didn't sound a like (or feature some depressed guy mumbling).Catchy (and distinct guitar hooks), amusing lyrics, unique singing style (often falsetto), and more importantly, it sounds like they're having fun.It's an uneven album, with some good songs and some bad, but for the most part, it's very enjoyable. Besides ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"", which is probably going to be considered a classic, ""Giving Up"" and ""Love on the Rocks with No Ice"" are great. The only songs I really hated were ""Black Shuck"" and ""Holding My Own"". (""Friday Night"" is pretty bad, too)"
3,i don't get it...,"this is a mediocre record. i'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. i saw them live and they were fun. but there's ten tracks on Permission to Land, and only 3 or 4 of them are really good songs. and that does not qualify as a classic...- cRAIG"
4,Pure fun!,"I haven't laughed this hard for 40 min straight ever before. You really can't take this music seriously enough to give it a close examination. Just listen to it and forget about where they lifted that lick or how frivolous it may sound. The Darkness have managed to make the most enjoyable album of the year and even if you're serious about your music, this album will surely crack a smile on your face. Don't take this band and album seriously. They're quite serious about that, you know.Enjoy!"
2,Get a new singer,"This wouldn't come across as such a tongue-in-cheek look at rock of the past if the singer had a decent voice. As it is, however, you can't take them seriously when the vocals sound this corny. The songs themselves aren't so bad (if you ignore the inane lyrics), but their vocalist drags them down. My advice: get a new singer."
1,the worst album I've ever heard,"I heard the album at a friend's house. thank god i didn't buy this thing. the album lacks a sound and the instruments aren't as powerful as some critics say. The worst feature is the vocalist who seems to be mocking high pitched singers and if that's his best attempt in singing I rather hear a dog bark. their recent single is quite annoying to hear on the radio, this album is full of chaos without organization and therefore it has no harmony...in my opinion. My advice is hear the whole album and think twice about buying something like this... I recommend Duran Duran's ""Medazzaland"" which I think has a lot of arranged melodies and it's sound is rawer than this album."
5,The Darkness ROCK!!!,"When i first heard ""The ""Darkness, i was amazed, i never herard a band play so good live! When i got ""Permission to Land"", i was slightly disappointed at hearing that none of the selected tracks were recorded live, though they are a fantastic band, and the album is superb, my best investment ever!"
4,Permission To Land?...............Sure!,"The Darkness may be wacky and at times horribly explicit however they make great music and this album surely packs a punch.Now personally I'm not that much of a glam-70's rock fan however this album has fulfilled most of my expectations in what an album should have. The only real problem is the obscenity of the lyrics and at times they sort of detract from the actual content.The guitars here are amazing they seem to soar and then drop and go all over the place with no trouble at all. All of the songs here stick in your mind for a long time. Songs such as ""Black Shuck"" are classic anthems that are just cool.Justin Hawkins has the most amazing voice and how can he get that high, his range is amazing. He sounds pure glam-rock.So with this album The Darkness have surely landed."
3,Nice crunchy riffs...,"Considering that most record labels are content with pandering to the here and now,The Darkness have released a pretty decent debut...Justin Hawkins has the balls to wear a catsuit in the PC norm of the politically stale state of rock and roll,and I hope that the band continues to grow...(Ahem gentlemen,a club tour of the U.S. would be nice...)Here's to avoiding the sophomore slump..."
1,Queen and Boy George do metal,"Can you even call it metal? This is so bad, it's funny. We sit around making fun of these lammers. What happened in Brit? Was there an over-supply of opera singers? When I first heard it, I thought it was a joke! Hey Simon!Where are you man? Isn't this the kind of crap you're supposed to filter!?God this is awful... it's really pitiful what's happening to rock and metal!"
4,Can they be both?????,"They are a straight Queen or a gay AC/DC. Which ever you prefer. In either case the album rocks from start to finish and will leave you wanting to hit the repeat. Its true they have a certain cliche nature about them, but who the hell cares. The bottom line is that the album rocks and videos are just too damn funny."
1,What a suck cd,"I thought Tiny Tim passed away,but apparently not.In fact,he has came back with his nuts in a vise no less.Is this group real or is it synthesizers.My dog heard ""I believe in a thing called love"" and let out a howl from the depths of uh DARKNESS.Get some singing lessons FAST and try your hand at making a decent cd or else just make a musical cd with no vocals,Hey theres an idea."
3,"Nice Guitars but, Tiny Tim on acid must go...","I'm giving this a 3 because the music (guitars) isn't TOO bad but one, it's not metal (as advertised) and two, the gay look and vocals are embarrassing. I'd like to rate it as 2.7 after seeing the biker from the Village People on bass. I can't rate the lyrics because I can't understand them.1. Get rid of the Queen look and pathetically forced ""falsettoing"".2. More Denim.3. Less ""fluff"" and intellegence assaults.There used to be a band that played at ""The Stone Pony"" here occasionally, that dressed in jeans and tee shirts, had some rockin' originals, and did the best Zeppelin ever. They finally got a record deal, but management had them dress all in white. I haven't seen/heard them since (1986)."
5,UN-FREAKIN-BELIEVABLE!,"I can understand how some people just don't get ""The Darkness"", but I also understand why the British music mag Kerrang! called them ""the greatest rock'n'roll band of the last twenty years"".I've been listening to rock for more than thirty-five years, ""The Darkness"" is the first group in a very long time to completely blow me away. Can't wait to see them live!"
1,I USED to listen to the Darkness But.....,.......but this is what to listen to:Pink FloydModest MouseIron and WineDeath cab for CutieRadioheadPixiesThe ShinsSyd BarrettNeil YoungEtc.
1,WHAT RUBBISH ...,"I listened to this - it was complete carp. The band are a load of rubbish, they can't play at all, just like the nil brainers that they are. Listen instead to the Carpenters, they are GREAT ! and real 'hard rockers'. Signed dizzycatie@hotmail.com"
1,The Darkness - Permission to Land,"Um.... I have a very broad taste when it comes to music, I play the guitar, listen to everything from death metal to pop rock... all I can say about The Darkness cd I listened to is... well... wow... hmm... God I dont know what to say. My first impression was, man... this is an awesome riff, this rocks, this song is going to be awesome... then this guy started singing who sounded like a cross between a dead cat and a squelching pig. The whole time I was listening to this cd I was kind of confused, and then my friend looks over to me and says ""Who lets this guy butcher their songs? The riffs and solos are great but GODDD I feel like kicking the singer in the head."" That summed up my confusion. Definately not worth buying. The people who like this... I don't mean to offend, but Jesus, this isn't music!"
2,Never compare to legends like Ac/Dc or Queen again please.,"Another rehash classic rock band....1 star for having guitar solos1 star for ""Love is Only a feeling""the rest of the cd is just laughable."
2,What the....?,"Well when I first saw this video on TV I couldn't believe my eyes or ears. It is so different from what you hear today. I call them a mixx of ADCD, QUeen and Iron Maiden. I actually like the song ""I believe in a thing called love"" but when I sampled the rest of the album, I didn't much care for the rest of their stuff.I think they are headed for one hit wonder land, personally but I give them credit for getting this far."
2,Sounds like he lost his Nads!,The Brits are nuts over this group. They are absolutly horrible.The lead singer sounds like he got his nuts in a vise.
3,"I hate to admit it, but it grew on me.","A friend gave me this as a gift, I really hated it at first, well at second also. I am a musician and grew up listening to rock ala Rush/Queen/ACDC and the metal bands like Tesla. The sad state of radio in my area prompted me to put this in my CD player and after a day or so it really started to grow on me. Yes its very cheesy and the vocals are horrible, but I catch myself singing along and actually laughing everytime I hear certain parts (Like the lyrics ""extra curricular"" in the song Friday Night). Like some of the other posts say you either get it or you don't, I think I get it.I definitely like this alot better than the sugar pop/rap stuff I hear in the radio everyday."
4,Is this Cronenberg or Lynch?,"Jean Rollin's film will definetly appeal to fans of the above named directors. It has a surreal, dreamlike quality that consistently keeps the viewer guessing as to what is going on. The story is one of lost identity, paranioa and inescapable fate, that one will remember long after viewing. The DVD is thankfully subtitled rather than dubbed and the actors voice inflections during crucial scenes help attain the atmosphere of dread. Be warned that the film contains graphic, probably x-rated sex scenes and strong violence. If you are looking for something different, give it a try."
4,A weird and disturbing nightmare.,"A group of people being held captive in an apparently empty skyscraper are slowly loosing their minds. They are not going insane, their memories and personalities are simply, and slowly, being erased. The whole movie plays out like a surreal version of David Cronenberg's Shivers (aka They Came from Within). This movie really weirded me out and robbed me of a good night of sleep. It took me quite a while to shake the effect off, so I recommend it heartily."
1,"Cheap, ugly, and uncomfortable.","The beads are cheap and poorly made, the chain is the color of rust, and the necklace is uncomfortable to wear. I didn't pay enough for it to make it worth returning, so I just tossed it in the trash."
5,Raygun's best!,"This is, without a doubt, Naked Raygun's best release. This is the first album to feature the ""classic"" Raygun line up of Pezzati/Haggerty/Kedzy/Spicer. From beginning to end, every song is great. The bonus tracks are ""Slim"", the b-side to the group's legendary ""Vanilla Blue"" single and tribute to actor Slim Pickens, and ""Rocks Of Sweden"", and song Raygun covered that was originally written by Pierre Kezdy for his old band, Trial By Fire. This is classic Chicago punk rock. If you're looking to get into Naked Raygun, start here."
4,Could have been better,"This is a very well written book and is full of details about Sandy Weill but the entire book plays on him being an undertrodden jew, but he fails to take into account that you don't have to be jewish to be the underdog - take Frank Lowrys Pushing the Limits he was jewish lived in the ghetto and there was not one mention that he was a victim he just got on with life and made the best of it. Again this is a very good book just read past the constant comments about how he was always being victimised jew."
1,Dust Collection 5 stars; Amazon handling damaged goods: 0 stars,"I bought this dust collection system because it works great. I've seen it in other shops and meets all my needs. The boxes arrived undamaged, but the dust canister inside the box had a one foot by one foot by 4"" dent. Getting a replacement from Amazon has been a nightmare. Next time, I buy my equipment from a local supplier, pay a few dollars more and avoid much grief!"
1,Jet 16-inch 1-1/2 hp. bandsaw,"ANY woodworking motor with no overload protection is a risk not worth taking. No excuse for Jet to make, or anyone to sell such a machine. If you are more than an arms length from the OFF button, or your reflexes are not as ""trigger-finger"" as they once were----well, good luck. Less than two hours of total use over a several year period (yeah, out of warranty) and my $800 investment is now worth less than $400. Saw needs no less than 2 or 3 hp. (with OVERLOAD PROTECTION)to warrant purchase. Otherwise, is it a good machine? I don't know. Mine didn't last long enough to judge. Good luck."
2,missing something,"I usually like her books but this one really did leave something to be desired. Would have helped if we had a little bit more information from Flynn but we didn't. For him to hold a grudge, claim that he didn't, and then ask her to give up everything for him . . . well I just don't know that I would. Shame on him for expecting a 17-18 year old to want to commit just like that. Why did he dump her? Because she didn't take the ultimatum? Hhhhmmmm . . . seems a bit of a role reversal here. Kinda don't like my male leads acting like what the traditional heroine would act like. Sorry."
3,"Great acting, loooong story","Enjoyed the movie, though the story dragged on a bit. The acting was awesome, and helped things along. I would have given it 4 Stars if, as a biography, the story had focused either more narrowly or simply hit 6 or 7 interesting portions of his life.Worth watching, but broken up into 2 chunks."
5,A DETAILED MOVIE ABOUT A MAN WHO CHANGED HOLLYWOOD FOREVER.,"How different would Hollywood be if it had not of been for Charlie Chaplin? This film is about Charlie Chaplin from his childhood days to his days in Switzerland. This film has all the important things that happened to Chaplin including: his first love, acting on stage for the first time, moving to America, getting paid $150 a week making shorts, opening his own studio, the many wives he had, the FBI and the reports on him, making talkies, getting kicked out of America, living in Switzerland, going back to Hollywood to get an award, and other detailed information about his life. This film is based on his autobiography."
1,i Cant wach it ...,I cant wach it ..it said my blu ray cannot read the disc ...terrible..money well spend for sure..i dont understand what happened
4,Loved it,Great movie that i enjoyed. I learned a lot about Chaplins life. I loved the begining of the movie but i was a little bored towards the end. But its based on someones life so I guess Im glad they didnt add in anything just to make it more exciting.
3,"Interesting, but lacking lots of details","In ways, it tells the life of Chaplin, but not in retrospective as diligently as I would like. Chaplin does not look old when he was about 60, it was pretty ridiculous watching a 25 year old playing 60 with just white hair in the movie. He had many kids and many wives I get it, and what else, a mom that was nuts, well who cares? They should have shown more about his techniques of how he did film, but all in all they did a fair job. I would like to see a re-release with deeper context of this genius."
3,So-so,"Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant and Moira Kelly is (briefly and gloriously) naked. That's all you really need to know if you're looking forward to anything. Otherwise, another dull by-the-numbers biopic from Attenborough."
2,One of my favorite movies,I just had to own this in Blue-Ray. I think it is the best movie ever and the best part Robert Downey Jr. has ever done.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ............,"Chaplin was one of the funniest, most creative men to have ever lived. Robert Downey Jr. is not. Somehow great Chaplin scenes are recreated without being even slightly funny. Attenbourogh is so fixated on literary cinematic methods (such as foreshadowing: at the start Chaplin is removing his makeup...a metaphor for stripping away the mask) that he forgets to make the story funny or tragic.I was very disappointed at the short shrift given to Stan Laurel in the story. He and Chaplin were friends and partners for years, but it is not even obvious who ""Stan"" is in his one miserable scene. Skip this one."
2,Worth 75 cents from a garage sale but not much more...,"Well, you can't complain much over a 75 cent garage sale investment but the enjoyment to time spent ratio was pretty low. Robinson spends way too much time developing characters that are killed off by page 70. Then the handsome naval officer, MIT PhD, cowboy, opera critic, wine connoisseur, etc. catches the bad guy and lands the Admiral's daughter. Yawn."
1,Really Boring Supermilitaristic,"This is a book for right-wing people who never met a military person who didn't cause them to think, ""What a man!!"" (There aren't that many military women in this book.) And people who think that the US military goes all over the world making it safe for us and others. And people who think it's fine to talk about shutting down a newspaper that prints things disagreeable to the military. One might wonder why someone like me kept listening to this book. I can only answer that I was promised excitement and many twists and turns. But there were hardly any of these. I skipped many tracks and followed the story just fine. And exciting??? The protagonist can't drink a cup of coffee without your having to hear how it tasted. If you think this is exciting, have at it."
1,Knowing details is not enough to become a Tom Clancy,"This book was a big disappointment, I'm sorry to say. I really like this kind of books, but I put this one away before I was halfway (and I don't remember the last time I didn't finish a book!). The author obviously knows a lot about the US Navy, but that's not enough to write a book you can't put away even if it's 3 am... Poor dialogues, unrealistic situations, etc. just give an impression of someone trying to be better than he is... Let me just say that if you like this type of books, go for the books of Tom Clancy (at least ""Red Storm Rising"" and ""Hunt for the Red October"") and if you've finished those, read Eric Harris' ""WW III"" and ""Shut down"". Not Robinson's ""Nimitz Class""."
3,Maybe Robinson had a wedding to get to,"Well what can I say, as far as technical aspects of the book it really does shine, it gives your hard-core Navy fanatic exactly what they want, a good, pluasible, Hunt for Red October like story with plenty of technical explanations and information they can use to impress thier friends (well, maybe not thier friends...) The problem is you can tell Patrick Robinson took a lot of time thinking the book through, such as the aftermath of the Jefferson's destruction, and the political aspect of it. But in the very end, it just seemed to me that everything ended far too quickly, the submarine fight in the end was totally different from any other naval part of the book, it wasn't well described and it was finished before it even started. It also felt something like this book was an advertisment for the Royal Navy, much like Clancy's Red October was an advertisment for the U.S. Navy. Otherwise it's a good book."
5,"Sorry for not a full review, but I must point this out.","I must point out that you all must have been into the book because no one took into acount that the techinical boo-boos you some pointed out can't be counted. On page 16 the date is give, along with the year. ""221700APR02 (the day, the time, 5pm, then month and year)"" Note the year is 2002, who is to say that the polocies have not changed.I'm enjoying the book alot, but I think that is because I'm taking it for the story. I liked how he let us know those killed before he did and I like how he described the insident."
1,Slow dreary view of the possible futur.,"This book is the worste thing ever published, it lacks action, drama, comedy, and all of the things that make a good book. I think that it has an excellent plot but the author has written it in a slow, unoriginal way. I don't recommend any to read it as it is a poor display of proffesional expertise."
1,No flair or pizazz.,"""Nimitz Class"" has one of the best ideas behind it I've have heard about in a while: the terrorist nuclear attack on the ""invincible"" carrier battle group. The first part of the book dealing with the attack on the carrier is decent reading, but then the book nose-dives. The culprit behind the sinking of the carrier is discovered only about a third of the way through the book, with the only question being what country is backing him. Who cares? Hell, I'm writing this review only a week after reading it, and I can't remember who was backing him. This book was that dull. The ending just died, and like one reviewer stated, Robinson must have had somewhere he had to go, so he just wrapped it up really quickly. Oh well. The teaser chapter for Kilo Class doesn't look promising, either."
4,The name sells...,I was attracted to the title as I served on USS Nimitz for four years. Of course the book centers around a fictitious Nimitz Class carrier rather than the namesake. The book is well written and includes a number of twists as the US tries to determine how a nuclear aircraft carrier could simply disappear in a cloud of vapor.
2,HE GETS THE EQUIPMENT RIGHT BUT NOT THE PEOPLE,"This book reads like some Aryan vision for a racially pure fighting force. All the heroes have fair skin and blue eyes with colored people nowhere to be found.Didn't Robinson notice that the US Navy was successfully integrated about two generations ago? He gets the equipment right but totally misses the human ethos of the real navy which, ironically, is way more interesting than his stereotype."
3,nimitz class,not mine belongs to ex but has to leave certain number of coments so I will type until it lets me submit
1,Busty cops 2,I just wanted to se it once and I haven't even watched it all the way through I can only take so much of this movie at one time.
4,I Love Mocassins!,"I'm a mom and moccasins have become a go to wardrobe staple for me. They are comfortable, durable, and stylish enough to go with a lot of different things. They are great for family walks, a day of errands, being around the house, playing with the kids, whatever. However, I gave this pair onl 4 stars for two reasons, First of all the tread of the bottom of these are incredibly slick, not at all like a lot of my others by the same brand with good tread for any kind of weather. Secondly, the color rubs off on your feet or socks. A better dye could be used perhaps? Overall, I am a satisfied customer and will be buying more in the future."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I bought this video converter about 2 months ago based on my experience with other Pyro products Id used in the past. It worked great for the first 3 weeks. Since then, however, no video or audio on the capture screen. I have put in requests with ADS Tech support 3 times, and have yet to receive one bit of support for the problem. ADSTech obviously feels very little responsibility for the customers who buy their products. All that being said, the Adobe Elements software works just fine."
1,bad company,"this company I do not give the product on time, but of a month to receive the product. I do not recommend service very badly."
5,The Way All CD-Singles Should Be!,"By far Hikaru Utada's best work. Not especially a fan of her earlier work, this single release made Utada a sensation overseas other than just her native Japan.The song ""Colors"" is a luminous poetic interpretation of colors in human life and relationships. She describes every color in the rainbow, and then ties it in with the stage of a relationship shes in. This was a novel concept and I don't think theres ever been a song quite like this.The B-Sides are good, but if you either get a chance to buy or download, I urge you to check out the lead single. And try to get your hands on the English translation to the lyrics. They're awesome."
4,More than just some primo Garcia,"This album's composition is sometimes joyous, sometimes dark. It's moody and sinuous. Some of Garcia's last recordings, the character of the album suggests a transition from one phase to another. A non-traditional rythm section comprised of tablas and frame drum creates an interesting backdrop for Mishra's classical guitar and Garcia's signature style. But this album is more than a showcase for some of Garcia's most unique playing. Anxiously awaiting Mishra's next release..."
4,Comprehensive and informative guide to a huge city.,"A subject like Beijing isn't easy to cover fully enough to satisfy everyone but this guide does a good job. It lists all the usual ""pricey"" options which many are looking for but it assumes the user/reader is traveling independantly or at least semi-on-their-own and also attempts to offer cheap/affordable options in all categories as well. I found that using this book in combination with the internet, I was able to construct the memorable trip that I wanted at the VERY budget price I demanded. Excellent descriptions of sights, great accomodation options and fairly easy hints on ""getting around"" by public transport."
2,Beware of errors,"I have made a couple of recipes from this book, including the Koto Kapama, which was very good. But I just made the olive oil cake (p. 22) and the recipe is completely WRONG. It calls for 1/2 cup of flour, which results in something that doesn't qualify even remotely as cake, and does qualify as completely inedible and disgusting (sad to say, as I just wasted about $15 worth of ingredients and my even more precious time on this mess). The same recipe on the Food Network site, which also features Cora, calls for 2 cups of flour--a bit different! I just wish I could find a way to stop others from making the same mistake; in any case, it certainly saps my desire to cook ever again from this book, which also has a rather confusing layout and organizational style. Too bad--I wanted to support a fellow Greek."
4,Very Good,"You people are pathetic. Get a life. I like Trapt, and if you don't that's fine, but when you feel the need to rant about how horrible you think they are for FOUR SIZEABLE PARAGRAPHS, I think you need something better to do. You obviously have too much time on your hands. Take a deep breath, calm down, and move on. It's okay, the world isn't going to end just beccause other people like music you don't."
3,"Nice sound, lots of potential.....","Trapt has a nice sound, with tons of potential, but something is missing from making this album great, instead of the decent one it actually is.""Headstrong"" and ""Still Frame"" have torn up the radio, and for good reason. They are two very good songs. This album has a few others, ""When all is said and done"", and ""These Walls"" are both very good as well. But the rest of the album is missing something. I can't really tell what it is, but it's not packing some kind of punch. It sounds incomplete. Maybe Trapt in the future will refine their sound to fulfill their potential as a collective whole.As it stands right now, this album is mediocre. Not a stand out album, but the band has a bright future if they go in the direction of their potential."
1,Trapt in Oblivion,"T ime for another lame nu metal act!R eally, is there no originality left?A ll ""rock"" music sounds the same.P eople who like Trapt just encourage it!T rapt's lead singer thinks he's hot.S ad to say, he's just another tool who can't sing.U nless you count his repetitive verses andC onstant whining and yelling.K eep on looking if you want a real band.S ad to say, but Trapt is just more trite drivel."
1,Just another modern day wanna be metal band,"The first time I heard ""Headstrong"" on the radio, I'll admit I was a bit intrigued, but when I heard the rest of their self titled major label debut, I quickly came to my senses. Just like labelmates Linkin Park, along with countless other rap-rock and post grunge sensitive rock bands, Trapt has little or no emotion in their music, and are just here to sell records and t-shirts and nothing else. The bass work is commendable, but along with the repetitive downtuned guitars and inconsistent drumming (plus the vocalist's almost unbearable whine that would make even Billy Corgan wince) make this another disc best used as a drink coaster. Skip this and stick to your ""Vulgar Display of Power"" album instead."
4,Could Have Been Better Harder,"I personally enjoyed this album, it had a hard feel, to a melow feel. Dont expect a hard album, expect smooth.1.Headstrong- Great starter song, a lil hard, catchy beat- 4/52.Made of Glass- Good melow song, keeps flowing after a hard begging- 5/53.Hollowman- Comes back to a some-what hard feeling- 4/54.These Walls- Mellow, soft, good beat, I can jam- 3.5/55.Still Frame- Second debut, shows they can be hard, but a lil melow- 4/56.Echo- One of the softer songs,it has a good rythem- 5/57.Game- Good song, smooth, and jamful- 4/58.When All...- Comes a lil hard, but still smooth- 3/59.Enigma- Feels like a slow dance song, but still good- 5/510.Stories- An acustic song, its a lil sappy, but still good- 4/511.New Beggining- Distorted vocals worked for this song, as it was like the rest of the song.. melow- 5/5"
5,Talented and yet Not too widely Known about,These guys are incredible no other rock cd I have ever heard cando what I have heard on this Cd none of my friends had ever evenheard of these guys when i asked them and the vocals are justincredible Chris Brown has a very unique voice and not only thathe plays the guitar too! My favorite song is probably 08 When allis said and done. Buy it now it rules!
2,What?,"'Each to his own' i guess, but I just don't see how someone can give this cd 5 stars. There is nothing remotely spectacular about this album. Okay, although overplayed Headstrong was a pretty good song, and Still Frame was alright too. that is the only reason I give this 2 stars. The music is solid, but where is that something extra, and the lyrics sound like they come straight from the book 'Nu-metal lyrics for dummies'(not a real book you guys, although it could be.) Anyways, I bought this cd to finally finish my Columbia House 'contract'. I guess I don't know what the biggest mistake of my life is then? is it this cd, or giving in to the 10 cd's for 1 cent each and 4 more at regular club prices through the next 2 years(plus shipping and handling)"
5,Trapt ia SURPRISINGLY good!,"They're always labled as hard rock/on the verge of metal, but they're not. Hard rock is kind of gritty, on the edge; metal is just loud noises; neither one usually carries much of a tune. Trapt, on the other hand, is definately Alternative. They have a distinct melody and rhythm throughout every song, and a very concious point to get across in each, also. I saw them live where they did a flawless cover of Nirvana's ""Rape Me."" If they can cover the greatest band of all time so well, they've GOT to be good."
2,Trapt is just OK,"Decent rock album. Headstrong is real catchy and has a good heavy beat to it. This is what you will buy the cd for. However, the rest of the cd leaves you with more of a 3 Doors Down kind of vibe. Which is not a bad thing.If you've never heard rock beyond MTV's TRL, then go ahead and knock yourself out to a cd that sounds pretty much like everything else.If you'd actually like to lisen to a rock band that will blow you away, pick up a cd by Thursday, .hopesfall., or Taking Back Sunday.I don't want to make this sound like I'm bashing Trapt, because they actually are worth listening to. But I wouldn't mind pointing out to all the people that reviewed this to 5/5 stars that they really should listen to some rock other than the [stuff] shoved down your throat by MTV."
1,0 stars,"God, i hate the radio and everything mtv and corporate america try to sell us and try to pass off as alternative rock or metal. Why dont you go out and buy a tool or radiohead album instead. Challenge yourself. ""Please help me cuz im breaking down...,"" now those are some original lyrics!"
4,Trapt - Great Band,"I downloaded this whole album and finally bought it. Its amazing, the vocals and guitars are layed out very well!If your tired of hearing metal artists yell into the mic with no actual singing, then this album is for you.Keysongs: Headstrong, Hollowman, Still Frame, The Game, Echo, When All Is Said and Done.Check Out: RA, Dry Cell, Flaw"
1,I had to give it one star....,"It wouldn't allow a half star?? There are two good, not great, but good songs on this album. Headstrong and Still Frame. All the other songs are boring, drawn out, go nowhere. Too bad, the first two songs I heard and I thought these guy were gonna be good. But then the rest of the songs are whiny [stuff]. Sounds like they would be a great addition to TRL."
1,Who signs bands like these??,"I was absolutely disgusted with the cliched sound brought forth by Trapt. Never in all my life have i heard a band so unoriginal. This album is, in my opinion, another that can be added to the stack of Kiddy-pop marketed as Rock. The outrageous amount of money this band is probably making would be better paid to relief efforts in Africa or some other desperate country."
1,I hate all of you stupid Jocks and Vapid Girlfriends.,"I mean, there is so much crap being passed off as ""art"" today, maybe not this crap band, but you know what im talking about. Another stupid song (i mean album) to make jocks think they are full of emotions on some sort of elevated level from everyone while at the same time trying to kick the crap out of each other. I hate all of you. Im not really upset, i just hate you. Im no better than any of you jackass' but atleast i can recognize that and also recognize the greed behind all of this worthless music/movies/etc. It reminds of Vanilla Ice (no not his new lamecore crap which im sure some of you jerks are into). Anyways, you all suck, i wish i lived before the industial revolution in some quiet village. Go pretend to ""feel stuff"" and be ""deep"" in your suped up cars and trashy personalites. God i hate you."
3,"Not necessarily awesome, but good","A couple of weeks ago I saw their video Headstrong on MTV, and I was kinda intruiged. Several days later, on a melancholic day I was experiecing, I went to a store and listened to the album. Hearing only the first six or seven songs was enough to grab the CD and buy it. I could totally relate to the lyrics.That was then when I found it really cool. Now a particular time I was going through has ended, and I kinda stepped away from TRAPT. Anyhow, I have only listened to the tracks Headstrong, Made Of Glass, These Walls, Echo, Enigma - and the fifth one, can't think of the title right now (you see?). The other songs I browsed but never actually returned to them again.It's still okay, and These Walls is really cool with me, owing to Chris Brown's outstanding voice.All in all, it's nice music to listen to, but the uncertain time I've had is over now and the memories connected to the TRAPT CD are too vast. My bad.Good CD, anyhow."
4,Great mix of hard rock and lighter sounds,"I listen to a lot of music. I don't hear about bands unless I hear them through the internet or through my friends. One of my friends told me about this band, and then I started listening to their music.It's a nice blend of metal and classic rock. I liked the music because the lyrics are awesome in ""Still Frame"" and ""These Walls"".Do Trapt a favor...Buy this CD. Your brain will thank you for it."
5,even more major mistake,"to ""major music fan from montreal"" - how many times have i said this, since oh, 1977ish, when i was about eight years old...blondie is a BAND. not a person. not a woman. a whole BAND. so it is NOT ""her first record"", it's THEIRS, unless it's deborah harry a'capella and i just was out of the loop on that one.ps, the album does rock."
3,Kinda boring,"I've seen this movie a couple of times on various television stations, and it just isn't that scary. Maybe the premise of a girl getting sucked into a t.v. is scary to some, but not me. The reason I give this 3 stars is the scene where the guy is ripping his face off. I still get chills from that scene, and after watching it, I have a hard time sleeping"
5,A FANTASTIC AND CHILLING THRILLER,I found POLTERGIEST to be a great film and a chiling one too there are a lot of scary moments which I'm not going to give away just watch and see. I never realized that STEVEN SPEILBERG had worked on this film and to his credit this is probably his most suspensful movie since JAWS. The cast also does a great job in this film espically CRAIG T NELSON and HEATHER O'ROURKE and so does JOBETH WILLAMS. My advice though is that because of some scary moments I would not recommend this movie for younger audienceses but older kids should be okay. Anyway those who love being scared will love this film I know I did.
5,Classic!,This is truly one of those new classics form the '80s. The movie moves well and is best seen unedited. Love the scene with the tree!
1,"5 Stars for the film, ZERO for this release!","This release is slated to have (extra-wise) a documentary and the trailer. After years of waiting for a proper release, Warner Bros. saddles us fans with this ill-conceived release. We all know of the mountains of extras that are available, and fans have no doubt given WB ideas on what to put on the disc. WB, this is absolutely contemptuous of you to do this to the loyal fans. Did you just not have enough time to put one together? OUTRAGEOUS!"
5,"A true ""Horror"" movie that is truly terrifing and scary!","Ithink that this is a good horror movie. It has a lot of creepy scenes. IT doesn't use slashing or anything like that to scare you. It uses a ghostly environemt. I would say that this movie is a instant horror movie. The DVD is the best format, don't buy the VHS format. One more thing, I don't think anyone under 10 should see this flick!!!"
5,The best horror movie from the 80's!,I was about 10 years old when I first saw this movie and at that time I couldn't sleep well for weeks! The clown scene was... still is EXCELLENT! The title says all! This is a must buy if you are an 80's fan or just want a good horror film
3,"Will never watch again, but not because poorly made","This movie scared like me no other movie I've watch which a guess is the point, but when you watch it in the theaters as a child sitting in a booster seat the scare sticks with you in a way it may not reach an adult. I only remember bits and pieces of the first time because I think I was cowaring in my seat and trying not to watch it. I wanted to give it one star, but think it is well made so at least deserves three. I don't recommend this movie for any child and have no plans to re-watch it in my lifetime."
3,It was very good when It's been released !,"I remember how scared this movie makes me 15 years ago. I just rewatch it and well,now, it became with time an average movie. For sure, the FX were certainly fantastic for this period, but these days with all the technologies, everything is quite laughable and anyway not very scary ! The story is still a good one. The soundtrack has certainly been choosen by Speilberg who's also the producer. What I will keep in mind, is the direction by TOBE HOOPER (a curiosity) and the everlasting angel face of Carol Anne :)"
1,Blew away the controller on first try,Don't buy this one. I blew it with just 2 panels and its supposed to handle up to 7 or so. And the company that makes them doesn't know a darn thing about the unit. Just a marketing company. Buyer beware is my thought on this product.
4,A sturdy mug - for travel and more!,"This mug works, not only for travel, but for people who have trouble drinking from ordinary cups for whatever reason."
5,I love this cup,"I love this cup. I left my old plastic wide bottomed mug at the cabin so when I got home the first thing I did was ask on freecycle for a wide bottomed cup with a lid and a freecycler gave me one of these cups. It's an awesome cupand I love it, so easy to drink out of, so comfortable in the hand, solid, classy, good looking, and it's easy toclean. Highly recommend but ask for one on freecycle before buying one and you might get lucky."
3,Insightful until you hit the details,"This book, first published in 1962, is a collection of essays and excerpts focusing on modern man's plight. The concept of alienation, from its genesis in the thought of Hegel and Marx, is one of the keynotes of modernism. Although published almost 40 years ago, much of the book remains timely and insightful. Unfortunately, much of the book does not. The selection on alcholism, for instance, is almost laughable in light of recent research. The praise lavished upon Chinese ""group study"" and Russian education of the ""New Soviet Man"" also strike one as out of place. Despite these deficiencies, this book still has much to say to the reader of today. If one can put up with a lot of the left-leaning lunacy and see through to the helpful observations this book is well worth the reading."
5,Muller is fantastic!,I have read all of Marcia Muller's books and this one was one of the best. I am never disappointed but A Walk Through Fire kept me on the edge of my seat. I sent this one to my sister and now she is a Muller fan. Sharon McCone is a great character and just grows better and better with each new book. I love the way Muller takes us through McCone's changes in lifestyles and boyfriends. I almost feel like I know this woman and could call on her to help me in any situation. She is not as flippant as Grafton but I can hardly bear to put the books down to go to sleep or to work. Muller is one of the best writer's of the mystery/private eye genre that I have come across and I have read quite a lot. This one was all the better because it took us out of the usual setting of San Francisco to Hawaii. Love it!
2,Does not live up to the rest of Muller's books,"Jumpy, terse narrative with lame dialogue, weak plot, poor character development--WHAT HAPPENED? I have loved the other Sharon McCone books, but this one just didn't measure up."
2,"Oh, so boring!","I picked this book up at a local thrift store and am so glad I only paid .10 cents for it. It took me 5 days just to get through it and I am almost sorry I did. There was really very little interaction between ""hero"" and ""heroine"". One conversation and a kiss and suddenly they were in ""love""? I like to think of myself as a romantic but even this stretched my imagination. I think throughout the whole book they only had maybe 5 conversation with each other,which lasted maybe one page each and were not horribly exciting! I would never reccommend this book or author to anyone."
3,Creative,The crime scenerios are very creative in this book. Character development is sacrificed somewhat by the breivity of the story. It is a very quick read and is pretty action packed and humourous. Enjoy!
1,Tiresome and chessy sci-fi,"This book, as can be gleaned from the title falls into the category of cheesy sci-fi. Reading it, I was reminded of the movie Zorro, as the plots are similar and the quality of both are roughly equivalent. I felt that the book embodied the worst of sci-fi; frivolity, bad style, lack of characterization, overall cheesiness."
5,Excellent Single,This single goes hard in just about every way! remind me of the good old days when music actually had substance.
5,My friends don't know,"Why don't my friends know about this movie? This movie should be common knowledge...out on DVD and sitting on the video store shelf somewhere in front of the last Tomb Raider film...right in front of it. Instead it's a ""mystery""... and one of my favorites. That it isn't out on DVD is strange. I own an old copy on VHS...always took it for granted that I could get it on DVD anytime. It is one of the strongest and most beautiful expressions of hope and friendship that I've seen in a film. All of the actors do an amazing job...this film rings true. We celebrate the ""flavor of the week""...but this film is beautiful...and deserves a huge audience."
2,Case Is Too Big For the 80gb 6th Generation iPod Classic,"I purchased this case for my new iPod 80gb 6th Generation Classic. First off when I opened the package it stank to high heaven. Smelled like some toxic chemicals where used to put it together. Leaving it out to air out for a few days finally took care of that issue. Then when I slipped my iPod into it, found out the case is almost double the width of the iPod. I had to put a piece of fur fabric in behind my iPod to push it out to the front of the case. Without the fur my iPod moved around all over the place. I wish I would of looked for a better fitting case!I am giving it 2 stars .......1) because the case is made of soft leather and it does protect my iPod........2) because of the price.If your looking for a case for the 80gb 6th generation iPod Classic....look somewhere else, this is not the case for you!!!!!!!!!"
3,Case is too wide for 80gb classic iPod,"Yes, this is an aswsome case - but unless I misunderstood - I read that it was for the **80gb Apple iPod Classic**. WRONG! The pocket the iPod slips into is so deep I could seriously fit 2 of my iPods into it. I can fully slide my fingers behind it! (NOT a good thing) So when you open the case and the iPod falls back, there is seriously 1/4"" ((at least)) gap between the cover and the screen/wheel. I'm going to have to stuff ""something"" behind the iPod just to pull it forward to use it comfortably. Good thing it was cheap or I'd be upset!Otherwise a 5-star awesome case. LOL"
3,Eh 3 stars,"I own a couple LTJ Bukem cd's so bought this one on name alone. Granted this isn't a collection of HIS songs but the styles on this album are very similar to his stuff and he seems to have exquisite taste. So it's a good cd overall, but just nothing to get terribly excited about - he's done better before. Still, it's good background/chillout/late night listening music. Overall though, 3 stars which is still better than most ""electronica"" cds out there.Check out Journey Inward if you're interested in a good preview of his work..."
1,"Great product: UPDATE- ""I hate you, you stupid piece of ****""","UPDATE:We've had this showerhead for a few months. At one point, we turned the water on and absolutely nothing, not a drop, came out. We messed with it, took it down, took it apart, still nothing. Apparently some kind of regulator in there had about a millimeter and that blocked all water flow. We had to pull really hard on the whole thing to kind of stretch it out and it worked again. Now a few weeks later it's freaking out again and water is coming out intermittently and an O-ring keeps coming off while showering. My new review title is what I just heard yelled from the bathroom. This item is nowhere near the quality of the original. Avoid it.Original review:Bought this to upgrade and replace a much older version of this showerhead. Great product, good quality, excellent water pressure. Love the flexible hose!"
2,Waterpik NSL-603 Chrome Flex Showerhead,"This showerhead has a great flow to it. I liked the look and the ease of the flex it had. But.....the thing leaked water from not only where it attaches to the water pipe, it also leaked all around the head. We tried tightening everything and followed all instructions, but it still leaked. We have an old Waterpik flex showerhead that we loved. It was getting old and so I thought to replace it with this new one. Still have the old one, soaked it in vinigar and water and cleaned it real well, put it back on and it works perfect. Don't waste your money on this newer model!"
2,It's mostly plastic with some magnets in the ends,This is a pretty wimpy magnet for it's size. Like the title says it's mostly plastic with some wimpy magnets in the ends. I was hoping for something stronger to impress my kids with magnetism but this falls way short.
2,A good movie for laughs,"I watched this movie in school after reading the book. If you're looking for a good movie that's fairly loyal to the book, then do NOT watch this movie, but if you're looking for an old movie that's so bad it's funny, watch it! The movie is dramatic, cliche, and poorly done, but because of that it's funny. True Son falls in love with a blonde servant. Half Arrow, his best friend, is an overly excited Indian with a strong Spanish accent. Yeah, that's Disney for you! It's terribly amusing, though not worth buying (unless you're getting it as a white elephant present for someone)."
5,THE LIGHT IN THE FOREST,It was diffrent in many ways. such as there was no shenendoah and there was no fight between uncle wilse and trueson.i think the book was dumb it had no action. but the movie was full of action which i like it had romance but that was kinda dumb. so therefore i give the movie a 5 out of a 5.CODY
3,Hm.,"The film The Light in The forest was exactly what you would expect in a Disney film. No gore no real fighting, if your an action movie lover then this is the worng flick for you. After reading the novel by Conrad Richter, Diney literally trashed this book. Changed everything besides a few things. Also if you like movies true to the book, skip this one."
3,I really couldn't get into!,I really think you shouldn't get the movie. I would rather get the book even though it would be a long or medium book to read. I actually believe that instead of watching the boring movie you should read the novel. Why is because when you read the book it makes you not want to put the book down. But if you watch the movie it will put you right to sleep. Also if you read the book it will have interesting characters that are not even in the movie. The movie is nice but it has different events and characters. Another thing is it doesn't really bring the picture out on how that person should really look. The book and the movie are just like hot and cold-opposites.
3,It's ok,"The workouts are ok, not my favorite. I just wish the instructor stopped reminding me to smile, I'm just saying."
3,Not worth the $,I own a lot of router bits and shaper cutters. If I was stuck using a router to do my rail and stiles then I would probably use this set but man that would be a bummer. I'd save your money and get a 1-1/2hp shaper and some shaper cutters to avoid burn marks caused by a router's high rpm's.The quality of these cutters is ok but Amana Tool makes cutters that kick the pants off these for a little more $.
3,Kraft Easy Mac easy for those on the go!,"This Kraft Easy Mac is a good version for those who like Easy Mac, and who are on the go. All you have to do is remove the lid, and the packet of cheese, add water, pop it in the microwave, reomove, then add the cheese packet, and its already in the bowl! No mess, no fuss. However, its not the smae original taste as the Easy Mac you make at home, but for those on the go, its well worth the price and effort."
1,Chemicals From a Tobacco Company,"This is great if you want to feed your kids chemicals sold by a big tobacco company. Kinda sending out the wrong signal, don't you think? There are a lot of macaroni & cheese products that offer the same or better nutrition, almost as much convenience, and usually much better taste, without supporting Kraft/General Foods selling and marketing tobacco to your kids and everyone else in the world."
1,Don't Buy!! Stickers don't stick or peel off!,"Great idea for interaction with words and pictures.There are 3 reasons for buying this book: Fun, kids peeling off stickers, and placing stickers.The stickers don't peel off, don't stick to pages and it is no fun.Just really poorly made."
4,Great first 'GB' English book...but if you are an AMERICAN... read on...,"I recently bought this book (and also the first 1000 Words in German) for our daughter. The book is very good, but American parents may need to make some changes in order to speak the same ""language"" that your child is learning. There are around 100 absolutely BRITISH words in the book where you might need to also write the American English word, so that your child learns both. (For example Lorry, Sticking Plaster, Petrol, Pram, Push-Chair to name a few...are not used in America.) Otherwise it is a great book."
3,Not really dried strawberries,When I ordered these I thought they would be freeze dried strawberries that I could use in cereal or for snacking. But they are somewhat dehydrated strawberries that have been super sweetened. I will use them for baking instead. Just be aware that they are not plain dried strawberries.
4,BraveBird,"I bought this cd just a few days ago. I'm in love with the first single ""for real"", she has wonderful vocals, her beats are also good. Still I could'nt really understand half of what she was singing throughout the cd. In this cd it sounded as if she was whispering or membling. Its still relaxing though."
2,this album is AIght,some of the music is nice&some of the Production is cool but Her Voice after a while can't carry the load&she runs out of gas. I Prefered Her with Groove theory far better than what I've heard from her solo.
1,NOT EVEN IF IT WERE FREE!,"I'm a big Amel fan. I've liked her since the first Groove Theory song, but This CD is a HOT MESS! I listened to it at the store with every intention on buying it. Had the salesperson offered it to me for free, I would have passed. For Real is the only good song. ZERO STARS!!!!"
1,Dream House,"This movie did not have a trailer to watch and I thought I was purchasing the movie with Daniel Craig. i thought it was called Dream House. I was wrong. I watched about 20 min. of this movie trying to get into it, however I was unsuccessful at liking it!:("
3,Do strangers in the movies ever do you any good?,"See DEAD CALM. I had heard nothing about this film when (1988) it came out and caught it at the movies on a whim. Today the three actors are all better known but DEAD CALM is worth seeing for its quality (Unlike, for instance, watching the early '80s bomb LOSIN' IT to see then-unknowns Tom Cruise and Shelley Long). Could you imagine saving a stranger whose boat's sinking, just to find out he's psychotic? As with many of these well-this-is-a-fine-mess flicks, DEAD CALM ends a bit shaky, but you will be rooting for Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill and may not mind."
2,Not scary enough for me.... (Spoilers!),"SPOILERS!Perhaps i'm the kind of person that doesn't get scared in movies: Psycho was boring, The Ring was funny, and Dead Calm was dull. If you find movies like Psycho scary, then you may find this scary. The premise is simple: a couple is taking a boat voyage, when they find a drifter who gets rid of the husband and terrorizes the wife. Now, there are some scenes that are shocking, such as when the baby flies out the car window. But this movie isn't really scary, it just has litle dialogue, lots of running and chasing, etc. But if you like thrillers, don't take my word for it, check it out, you may enjoy it :)"
4,Good Camera For The Price,"I was very excited when I got my camera, as I had previously owned a Fuji F30 (which was stolen... lucky thief!) I thought as the latest camera and with 12MP and improved face detection etc., it should be fantastic...To be honest, I had read all the reviews and still decided to buy the camera. The face detection works pretty well, most of the time, even in low light conditions, once the subject is close and you do not have to use the zoom on the camera - you get beautiful clear portraits of people, the flower mode is fantastic and the shots in low light conditions are far superior to the F30.Overall to be honest, I still prefer my F30 - but the F50fd has a much sleeker, more sturdy design, and is a good camera for the price.The reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because of the X3 zoom, it's something fuji definitely needs to address, and the 12MP - is really not anymore impressive than the 6MP I had on my F30. But I have no regrets whatsoever!"
1,"Not reconditioned, just broken","I purchased this set and found it to be returns that were not fixed. I have purchaced reconditioned porter cable tools before with no problems. Each component of this Dewalt set had a problem. The drill had a slipping clutch, one battery had a loose clip that would not stay in the tool, the saw clearly had a problem in the gears from the sound.Selling this item as ""reconditioned"" is false advertising."
4,3.5 stars... Lead-off single from the new album,"The Yeah Yeah Yeahs return after an almost 3 year absence following the ""Fever to Tell"" breakthrough album with a new album (""Show Your Bones"") and this preceding single from it.""Gold Lion"" (4 tracks, 14 min.) brings the opener track from the album. The sound on ""Gold Lion"" is less raw and garage-oriented than the ""Fever to Tell"" sound, but it is undeniably catchy and Karen O.'s vocals are in great shape. ""Let Me Know"" is a demo of a new song that did not make the final tracklist of ""Show Your Bones"". It is very accoustic, and nice, but an even further moving away from the garage sound that put the YYYs on the map.The last 2 tracks are remixes of the ""Gold Lion"" song, and not much to write home about. I'm not for remixes, and these are quite mechanical and industrial-sounding, definitely not my cup of thee. But the original ""Gold Lion"" song is quite good, and I'll be interested to see how the entire album sounds like."
3,GOOD REFERENCE BOOK,"This book was recommended to me by a personal trainer that I met on a cruise. I thought that I would use it just as a general reference book, but it is actually so interesting that I found myself reading the whole book. Still don't quite understand the yin-yang thing, or the concept of ""hot"" and ""cold"" foods."
4,How to cure what ails you,My accupuncturist keeps using this book to direct the nutritional portion of my healing. I found it practical and sometimes easier to understand than he is. I am very interested in being well and am very commited to being empowered to do so through nutrition. This book is very comprehensive towards that end.
3,excellent performances by all,"Ok, I rented this because I figured my girlfriend would like it, but so did I. Michelle Pfeiffer is her most riveting. I normally don't like Treat Williams, but I found his character very beleivable here. Also the young man who played Vincent (17 yr. old) will do well to keep acting, he has a road ahead of him. I know it sounds like a movie-of-the-week plot, but it is quite effective. The DVD itself has a short (5 min) featurette, that is about as enlightening as it sounds."
2,Hard To Swallow Ocean,TDEOTO has all the qualities of a poor TV movie that tries to pull at the heart strings but winds up being incredulous and insipid. A waste of substantial actors such as Michelle Pfeiffer. And a truly sappy ending.
3,( WHY DON'T THEY ) SHOW SOME GRATITUDE AND RESPECT TO GEORGE,"A child was missing. Beth's guilty almost damage her marriage, abandon her career and neglect other children. Finally she get over it and luckily to find her boy after 9 years. It was supposed to be a humanity and very touching drama. The biological family want him back, I can feel it. But they don't have to cut him off from George. The good man adopted Sam and brought him up as his own. Have some empathy, the kid love him. He's a friend not an enemy. Why don't they try negotiate to share Sam's custody, 3 days a week or something, be friends with George. They all live in the same community after all.For they treat George so mean, I don't feel the story convincible."
3,eh,"Still not my most favorite series by Briggs. It was highly entertaining and I enjoyed the history and adventure the characters went on. The ending was extremely predictable which was kind of annoying. I was hoping the nemesis would've been someone not so obvious. Oh well. On the whole, this is a nice ending to Briggs' two book fantasy series. It was a good series to read if you're looking to kill time in between other book releases."
4,A Fair Translation,"This translation is quite literal when it is compared to the original Arabic codex of the Quran, the definition of words, syntax and rhetoric do not stray much from the original tongue and it's a fair translation by a non-Muslim."
1,Just Like the Title Says,"This is not an interpretation of the Koran. It is simply an English translation of its complex phrases and esoteric language for which clerics are appointed to help people comprehend.For this reason, the first half of the title is incorrect, and the second half is correct. Ergo, the one star.If you're looking for a translation in understandable everyday English don't make the same mistake of ignoring the title as I did, keep searching.Ron DiGiovanniEaston, PA"
1,"beautiful language, but crucial mistakes","Three things are necessary to make a good translation of the Quran into English: mastery of English, mastery of Arabic and knowledge of islamic history/faith. Arberry's has great command of the English language but unfortunately he comes short in his knowledge of the Arabic language and Islam. This makes his translation a beautiful read, but extremely inaccurate and even plainly wrong in crucial parts. For a much better translation I would recommended Muhammad Asad or Nooruddin. Pickthall's translation also is good, but difficult to read."
5,geisha girl dress,i rec'd it in good time all in tact. the only bummer is i only wore it one night as i got sickrobin
2,pretty but not worth the price,"I bought this because it looked so pretty and had such good reviews. However 10 days after it was purchased it broke. Not made very well for a bracelette, the metal pc that are the connections are way to thin & fragile. Its VERY light!!!! Wouldnt advise purchase of this"
2,Palmikstry for All - Cheiro,"This book was a monumental disappointment. I had checked the book out from my local library, that book having at least twenty pictures of palms and examples. The book I received had not one palm picture in it. The information in the book might be good but when it references a plate to view, there should be a plate to view."
4,A good book with basic principles.,Cheiro is a master of metaphysical art. I have read his many books. This is a basic book and can be used for reference as well
1,"Good music, terrible recording","This disc has some early and delightful tunes on it. The early essence of the spooky ""Night Tripper"" in all his voodoo funk. The recording however sounds like it was recorded from the next room over. It lacks sonic clarity, presence or any three dimensional sense. While this is better than not having heard the album, I would not recommend this pressing to anyone."
1,Unwatchable,"The headline on the case looks like a sure fire winner: Tobe Hooper directing! Englund staring! Based on a Stephen King book! Well this movie just plain sucked. I remember reading the short story of the Mangler and thinking it was some of King's worst writing. Then I remember I have a weakness for really bad horror movies, so I picked this baby up. Aside from a few cool scenes of gore, this movie just drags on and on. Englund's acting is really not up to par on film; He seems wooden and not into the role. Also, films based on King novels are never that good, ive recently discovered. Read a book instead of watching this movie."
4,Very well put together,"The documentary was well outlined. I believe educating your family & friends with movies such as this will remove the hopelessness and help us right our government.Very simple movie, but remember McDonald's can fight 1,000,000 of us who is going to fight for us?"
5,Must see movie.,"People think they know about the McDonald's hot coffee lawsuit... they don't. Everyone should watch the movie to see how the justice system has been taken away from many by ""tort reform"" and ""mandatory arbitration"". What you don't know could hurt you."
5,Cute book,I bought this book for my daughter who loooooves to fish! This book was perfect for her and delivered in a timely manner. Thank you for making christmas a hit!!
3,Quality Control,"5 stars for the show minus 2 stars for the quality of the discs.Received my sealed DVDS of Amazing Race Season 5. Discs had scuff marks and circular scratches. The company that produce these on demand need to tighten up their quality control. It's not acceptable to receive new discs that are marked and paying $25+.The video is rather grainy and not great quality on a big plasma it has to be said. This probably has more to do with the source material than anything else.If people have already recorded these from the TV screenings, there is really no need to get these unless you want the covers. There is no upgrade in quality of image. It may even be less."
4,Wonderful!,"This is the first Demille book I have ever read, and it is because I heard that it would be made into a movie starring John Travolta (I'm a BIG fan), but I wasn't disappointed at all! The best thing about it is its ""no s*it"" characters. It's so bitingly witty, and you actually ""move along"" with the characters. I don't know how to describe it, but the characters are such that you would want to see them again in another book. I am now in the middle of Plum Island, which is even better than this I think!"
3,Not impressed,"This book is supposed to be a thriller but lacks the punch finish that makes reading it worthwhile. It is compelling most of the way through, but lacks excitement or surprise in its grand finale. There are also some things that don't tie together like (don't read this if you want the surprise) why the bayonet left no hole in the ground, and what was the whole point of it anyway?"
3,Demille fails to pull it off!,"I chose this book because I had heard of the movie and appeared to be an excellent thriller. In fact I found the plot boring. There was no intensity or suspense. The novel makes an attempt at romance but fails in convincing the reader of the whole affair. I read the entire novel waiting to find out who did it, but the story ended unsatisfying and with my questions unanswered. The interactions and interogations of people kept my interest. Also, I was intrigued by the characters in their descriptions and personalities. A descent read but unsatisfying."
5,Good book AND movie,"With a brisk pace and a stunning evocative power that ranks it up there alongside my personal list of favorites with 'The Triumph and the Glory' and 'Hearts in Atlantis', this exceptional novel fulfilled all of my expectations from beginning to end. It is one of the best books I've read in the last year."
5,Don't watch the movie! Read the book.,"I made the mistake of watching the movie before I read this book. The movie could not be furtherer from the book. I loved the author's use of humor throughout. Instead of using this book to kill time while the kids played at the park and such, I got wrapped up in it. I could not wait to finish this book to see how the case was solved. I hope for future projects the author demands that the movie stays closer to his work."
4,The General's Daughter,Demille did a very good job with this book. I read it within 36 hours and found it exciting and believable. After reading the book I had the misfortune to see the movie which I found a total waste of time. Demille is a much better writer than whoever directed the movie is a director.
4,Had me wondering for days after finishing the book.,"Demille has a gift for character development. He places you into the minds of a detective, psychologist, general, and a young female officer. You see the plot in each of their eyes and just as you get a glimpse of what might happen Demille baffles you with another twist. Very entertaining and well written."
3,Just a comment...,"Good piece of fiction, but not for the weak of heart, in some points, due to the explicitness of the material."
5,Spectacular,I recommend this book to everyone! I have to admit that this is the first novel in the murder mystery catagory I have ever read and Demille is awesome I will definately read more of his books.It is a book you don't want to put down.A book worth reading for anyone who loves to read.
2,simple psychology,we have a saying in this business: simple psychology is bad psychology....i hope the author does not run into anybody from the 82nd airborn.
2,"OK if you're desparate and only have ""Ulysses"" on hand","It seemed a bit boilerplate for me. There's the trademark stuff by DeMille; the sexual angle and the brainy detective work. It does seem to lack the enterprise of The Gold Coast or Plum Island.Still, it reads well and does present the darker side of humanity in a reasonable manner.For DeMille fans, it gets 3 stars; for others not familiar with his work, 2 stars - start on The Gold Coast or Plum Island first."
4,Superbly written mystery with dark secrets....,"Demille is a wonderful storyteller and only receives one complaint from me: too many irrelevant descriptions into the past of lead Army CID investigator Paul Brenner. While some of this detail does help to develop Brenner's character, there is no relevance to the main plot and investigation into the murder of Captain Campbell - The General's Daughter.The main plot brilliantly unfolds as layer upon layer of dark secrets and corruptions unfold on a Southern Georgia Army post. Going by forensic evidence, the initial search of the vicitm's property , and the half truths told by the victim's family and colleagues, the criminal investigation team attempts to recreate the sequence of events the night the murder occurred. The mystery behind the murder will leave you guessing!An intelligent and suspenseful book that I highly recommend to my friends and family."
5,"Read the book, but skip the movie.","First of all, this is an excellent book, one for its plot, but more importantly in it's dialogue. All of the main characters, and especially the shadier characters are written well. When you read a conversation between two major characters, especially those that are opposed to each other, you get a feeling of two boxers sparring, or two dancers, each responding perfectly to the moves of the other. Also, the ending and premise are not predictable, but are still plausable. Worth the read."
4,Pure John Travolta!,"From the first chapter of this exciting investigative tale, you will recognize Paul Brenner as a cocky, confidently arrogant John Travolta, the actor who stared in the movie version of this book. We find two elite investigators for the Military's CID under time pressures to solve the rape and murder of Captain Campbell, the Base General's daughter. DeMille has dealt with the ugly issue of Rape and Murder in an analytical and informative way as he and his partner uncover new complications every hour into the investigation. Enjoy the meat of the book as much as you can, because the ending, although satisfying, might seem a little quick and simplistic to you."
5,Miss Julia Meets Her Match,"I have fallen in love with the characters in the ""Miss Julia"" series. Ann B. Ross always thinks of a fresh new story line, so each book is a gem."
1,Boring and formulistic,"Reading this is kinda like eating a box of donuts...the first 2 or 3 (in this case books) were really good, the rest tend to lose their flavor and texture."
5,STERLING VOICE PERFORMANCE,"Voice performer Claudia Hughes gives a superb reading of this ""Miss Julia"" story, perfectly capturing the modulated, softly Southern tones of our protagonist. The cast ofcharacters gives Hughes ample opportunity to display her talents as she segues to the proclamations of housekeeper, Lillian, and her rambunctious five-year-old great-granddaughter.Hearing Miss Julia is both fun and entertaining, thanks to Claudia Hughes.- Gail Cooke"
3,a little disappointed,"I was looking for 'static poses' as I have in another yoga dvd, Yoga for Weight Loss. While this one fits that bill, as it isn't the up and down routines, there is soooo much voice over, tooooo much information, to the point of distraction, for me anyway. It was a new workout but less than what I wanted in terms of exercise, and way more than what I wanted in terms of information. She should have included the information separately and left the pose holding with some nice music."
4,Similar to Getting Ready for Preschool,No doubt this good stuff for the audience - Umm this DVD and Getting Ready for Preschool are nearlyidentical - There is just a slight variation
3,"Tangerine Dream - 'Live In America,1992' (Navarre) 3 1/2 stars - Running time: 50 minutes","First time I've ever seen this concert DVD.Not great,but fairly good.Show was taped on October 25,1992 at the Paramount Center in New York.Plenty of beautiful images,scenery and a little bit of psychedelic visuals spliced in with the tunes the band performs.Tracks I liked the best were ""Treasure Of Innocence"",""Oriental Haze""(I'm sure this came from the 'Risky Business' movie),""Phaedra"" and ""Hamlet"".Quality of the live footage of the band onstage isn't the best,but acceptable.Decent German 'new age' electronics at work here.Simply let the music take you away."
5,"Why You Crying? : My Long, Hard Look at Life, Love, and Laughter",I love this book. Not only did the book help me understand his comedy even more but I was was able to relate to him more now than before I read his book.On top of him giving us a look into what his life was truly like he still made me laugh with his excerps.
3,Funny & honest.,Good read. George is very honest about the tuff time's in his life. Funny guy and would be a good read for his fan's.
5,Supperb practical advice for begginers and experts alike,"After more than a decade coordinating small, mid-size and humongous events - and having had to write my own guidelines for future events - Jan Moxley's extraordinary work was a most welcome and unexpected surprise when it arrived just in time for Pope John Paul II fourth visit to Mexico, where we put the whole package (book and CD) to the test, under extremely difficult constraints and conditions.The results were spectacular!Whether you are an expert in the field, or are just getting ready to face your first event, Moxley's book is more than just ""a must!"": It will be your guide, mentor and advisor throughout every stage of your planning and execution, as well as a most welcome companion when having to explain difficult technical considerations to ""non-techies""."
2,Not was I was looking for,"I was looking for a book that could help me set up parades, festivals and meetings. Adavance Coordination Manual focused a lot on stage set up-breakdown and contracts. This book was not very helpful for me. I'm sure it could offer direction for those planning very large events."
2,Weak Collection,No particular reason other than these are not very good songs. Nothing worth listening to more than once. Case closed
2,Time detracts,"When this album first came out it seemed memorable. As time goes on, its impact diminishes. However, the AC Reed track featuring Bonnie Raitt almost makes up for the rest. Her slide guitar ranks. Most of the other tracks are highlights from other Alligator albums but they generally no longer measure up."
2,Elementary,"Her other books aid designers much in the use of color in gardens, and she has earned respect in that manner, but I feel only an certified arborist would be qualified to write on this particular subject. It seems as if the book were thrown together. It's poorly written, poorly organized and the conclusions distorted. It would be better to refer directly to the sources named in the book than to the skewed interpretations in the book itself."
1,Skagen Men Watch very poor quality,"I purchased a Skagen Women Watch and also a Skagen Men Watch to give as gifts to my sister and nephew. Although I've been buying from Amazon for some time (mainly books), this is my first experience in buying Skagen Watches. The quality of those watches is very poor. The strap of the Men Watch came apart not very long after my nephew got the watch from me as a gift. I'd have expected better quality for the price I paid. This is the reason why I'm giving only one star to Shagen Watches."
3,A fictionalized account of what happened to the Bismarck.,"This is a quick easy read for those wanting to know about the end of the German super battleship. The book is from the fifies, but the recent reprint gives a fictionalized concept of what happened when the German super battleship ventured out into the North Atlantic and met its fate. Since there were few survivors from the ship and almost none from the Hood, C. S. Forester recreates what could have been said. For young adults, this is a good read. I read this almost thirty years ago, and decided to read this again.For one needing more information, this is not the book. It reads like a novel, but gives an overview of the struggle for the Atlantic in World War II. This is an easy read though."
5,Great speed rope for great price!,"Awesome product! A tad too long for me..I'm 5'4""..but easily solved by tying a little knot on ends and tucking into handles."
2,Box Cover deceiving,"Like most or all movies of this genre, the exotic box covers pulls in suckers/viewers to the movie. Viewer is disappointed after watchign the movie, looking for exotic, big-busted babes in prison, doing catfights, shower gropes, etc. The good parts are few and far between. I prefer the old Pam Grier WIP (Women in Prison) movies. More skin, more violent women action scenes thjan in this mild, lame triple-feature. Watch on FAST FORWARD, stop movie to watch the few scenes worth watching when yuo find them."
2,What happened to this show?,This show is terrible now and it used to be a favorite. Seasons 1-3 were a wild ride and I thought season 4 had some problems but overall it was a great change of pace. I was excited to see how S5 would unravel the mess from the S4 ending. Well I just finished watching and it looks like the writers ran out of ideas. The plot is contrived and many of the jokes felt forced and unfunny. Worst of all the characters are all despicable now with the exception of Nancy's eldest son. The writers quit trying to write thoughtful scripts and started relying on shock value. This is evidenced by the inclusion of a disturbing and gratuitous rape scene. A scene that two of the show's writers and Kevin Nealon joke about during one of the episode commentaries. I'm not sure why I'm even giving this thing 2 stars but it does have that trainwreck quality to it. You just can't quite quit but you know you should.
5,Weeds is a winner,"Another season of Weeds, another set of problems for Nancy and her family. Luckily their biting humor helps them get through tougher and tougher times and keeps the audience laughing and wanting more. With a whirlwind beginning and a great cliff hanger, the Weeds cast wins your hearts and keeps you wanting more!"
3,This Season Not my Favorite.,Beginning to lose appeal...both in story lines and the way they worked it more into drama and less comic relief. Hope they get back to more humorous base line for season 6. I can wish can't I...no pay for TV here in these rural woods so waiting each year for next DVD release. It works for us:))) Loved this series from 1-4 and have not given up on it as always the optimist.
4,Great Show,I love all the seasons of Weeds. Blu-ray is just so awesome!If you love all the other seasons get this it leaves you hanging at the end like always!
5,WHAT CAN YOU SAY BUT JUST.....HOO HA!!!!!!!,"This beautifully written, acted, directed and told film is a gem. I cant tell you how great Al Pacino is you'll just have to see him yourself in this wonderful film that has more to it then just an angry blind col. This film has more demensions to it then a cube. You see Frank Slade has a solution to his problem and so does Charles Simms. They are both bad solutions and what can they do but help each other out with each of their problems. Its really a brilliant film and Al Pacino has never been better. Excellent film."
5,Good to go!,A most surprising movie that sneaks up and enchants you. With a most improbable plot of a Blind Army Lt. Colonel taking a weekend trip to New York and coming to the aid of a new found friend. This movie is one of my all time favorites and is a great morale builder. I don't want to give any more away but I can recommend this film most highly! I am just sorry that I can not give it a higher star score.
5,A real masterpiece!,"A tail of a young man about to begin his life and middle aged man wanting end his own. Together, they change each other's life in the course of one Thanksgiving weekend. The movie builds to a spectacular ending where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. A must see film! -John Born"
4,A blast from the past,"This CD is a compilation of several Muppet LPs I owned in the early 80s (for the young ones reading this, an LP is a Long Playing vinyl record). Back then the songs appeared on ""The Muppet Show"", ""The Muppet Show 2"" and ""The Muppet Show Music Album"" LPs and featured songs from television's ""The Muppet Show"". Highlights of this CD include the opening ""Muppet Show Theme"", ""Mah Na Mah Na"" (does anyone NOT know this song?), ""Cuanto le Gusta"" (Miss Piggy's tribute to Carmen Miranda), ""Happy Feet"" (Kermit tap-dancing and singing) and ""Who?"" (starring Zelda Rose and her singing owl). My only gripe -- and it's a BIG one -- is this CD can't possibly be more than 30 minutes in duration -- they could have quite easily fit ALL of the ""The Muppet Show"", ""The Muppet Show 2"" and ""The Muppet Show Music Album"" LPs onto this one CD. For this reason I deduct one star."
3,Retrospect Express with the WD drives,"For those of you having problems with Retrospect Express from WD, goto EMC's web page and get the updates for the latest MAC OSX. They have fixed many problems with the software for the MAC but is probably not being distributed with WDs drives.I have Retrospect working with a WD storage area network drive over the ethernet and it works fairly well. One hint prior to backing up - open up all your web browsers and purge their cache memory. Retrospect got hung up on not being able to read all the cache files I had for the Safari web browser.Good luck.I gave the drive 3 stars so as not to influence the outcome because I really don't own the drive but want to because of its FW800 capability."
5,My Book Pro,"Very easy installation. Could have been four stars for the power button not working reliably and the drive was becoming mysteriously unavailable in it's first weeks of use. Not an issue any more... may very well have been malicious content on my drive that has since been ushered out. All is working now. All photos videos music and lesser used files run from it, what a relief to clear up all that space!"
4,Kids LOVE it!,"Several years ago when I was doing some resort hotel babysitting, I grabbed a copy of this to put in my ""bag of tricks."" Every child who viewed it fell instantly quiet from beginning to end, then did not want to part with it. I left it with the first family, and along the way bought several more so I could leave it with children who wanted to see it again. This copy that I found on Amazon is going in my suitcase as I leave to spend 2 weeks in Montana with my sister, who now has two grandchildren, 6 and a 3 years old. I am absolutely sure they will watch it over and over again. If I were rating this from a child's perspective it would be rated a solid 5-stars!"
5,Black Beauty,"I love that video Black Beauty and I read the book and I like the black one because he is a thoroughbred.I think Quarter Horses are black.In the video Black Beauty the sad part was that he fell down because, he couldn't pull the heavy load."
5,Black Beauty,I sent this as a gift to my grandchildren the Toyko so I really can't evaluate it. The service was good. The product came quickly and was in very good shape.
4,Black Beauty,"Beautiful movie. Very touching. I read the book before, and the movie is very loyal to it. Buy it ,you won't regret :)"
2,OMG!,"I hate this movie, nice horses but theres litteraly no point of that for this is a movie not for a horse lover! Animal abuse and dead horses, bad bad bad movie! If you have a horse or just love horses take me advise DONT WATCH IT!"
1,The updated version is available FREE online.,"I had the pleasure of studying under Dr. Swan, the author of this book. He has a new version of this book for every single semester of classes, but they aren't officially published versions. He used to have the print center make course guides, but now (for the first year book) he has put the book online at http://polish.slavic.pitt.edu/. It's always his most up-to-date version. Also, instead of doing the drills at the end of the chapter on paper, he has a free computer program called Lektorek. It tells you when you are wrong so that you don't learn something incorrectly. It's sort of buggy sometimes, but for the most part it's much easier to learn Polish with this program. Another advantage to the online version of the book is that you can click on the drills that you'll have to do in the Lektorek, and it will pronounce it for you. The conversations border on the surreal, but all in all, I did learn a lot from the Lektorek and online pronounciation."
5,Best value for the money,"Bought my Wagner about 9 years ago. Since then I have painted my billiard parlor (8000 square foot building) my warehouse, my personal garage and the inside of my billiard parlor not to mention numerous side projects. My aunt has borrowed this sprayer to paint her business and I have loaned it to friends. Took this long for the gun to fail finally. I dont know what people expect for a $100 paint gun. I bought mine reconditioned at a hardware store on clearance for $50 and cant complain how much use I had out of it. yes it splatters if clogged or low on paint. It doesnt spray like it did 5 years ago but the money it saves on time more than makes up for it. Definitely a 5 star on value and longevity."
3,one Gem for sure.,"the Live Lonnie Mack tune,""natural Disaster"" is worth the price for this disc.some other great tunes as well by Katie Webster,and the Kinsey Report.it is not remastered by today's standard but still sounds pretty good."
5,One of a kind.,"There are not enough movies like this that actually keep you eager to know what happens next. Lots of twists and surprises and believable characters played by a dynamite cast. Instead of catering to squeamish viewers, the film is high on vividity to help us better perceive the intensity of the situation."
5,Is this Sam Raimi?,"My God. Sam Raimi did some bizzare stuff in the 80s that I loved: Evil Dead and it's sequel, the pesudo-sequel Army of Darkness in the early 90s. Then there's this. Grown men cry through movies like this. Brilliance, sheer brilliance. The film cuts you like swallowing a straight razor it's so excellent. Now, this isn't a Fargo rip-off like some think. In fact, I think this is far, far better that Fargo but that's me.And I'm usually right..."
2,i think the movie had a bad plot,it lost my intrest in the first 10 minutes of the movie. try a little harder next time.
4,Can't Ever Compare a Movie with the Book!,"Generally I wouldn't have never seen this movie as I didn't know who the Director was or certainly would never had seen the movies he did. I was compelled to see the movie via suggestion and chose to read the book first! The movie was good, however, you can never grasp the desperation of the characters, and how evil Hank did become. Too many changes occurred. In the end, Hank was made to look caring & loving toward his brother, but in the book, what he did to his brother was true evil, to save his own soul. A minor blooper: The BOOK said old man was done in with scarf, MOVIE doesn't show that, MOVIE confession mentions scarf. Bridget Fonda was just there, Billy Bob was convincing, and the character of Lou was what I had pictured. Paxton did good job. If you are only into the ""movies"", it was good, if you read the book, it was better!"
2,I dunno...,"I suppose the biggest problem is that, while it's evidently supposed to be a neat little morality play about how greed corrupts and whatnot, it never really humanized the characters before daemonizing them. There are numerous problems of believability beyond that, but it doesn't really matter--the film just lays it on too thick to really get anywhere. Yeah, Thornton is quite good (surely the author was influenced by Of Mice and Men), but all in all it's just sorta goofy. Ah well."
2,The book is better,"""A Simple Plan"" could have been a truly great suspense movie and drama -- if it had only stayed true to the book. It seems weird to say it because the movie was written by the same man who wrote the book, but he had it right the first time. The movie never really lets you feel the full impact of just what the characters have done, and how far they will go, to keep the money. If you really want to see the depths the human spirit can sink to for money you should read the book."
3,What happened to three of the characters?,"This movie is ok if you haven't read the book. I can't believe that the author, who also wrote the screenplay, left out three of the characters that were in the book, and a really terrifying scene near the end of the book, which involves two of the characters that were eliminated from the movie. The book is far superior, and even more scary than the movie. Skip the movie-read the book!"
4,Better Than Expected!,"When I bought this I thought ""Another Action Flick "". What can I say? All of us make mistakes. The ending of movie was pure magic. I had never expected something of this quality from the previews I saw. Don't be misled it does have action but it also has a point. With a top notch cast this movie should last as a favorite for quite some time."
4,excellent buy,"I've only had the watch a short Time. It's light, keeps accurate time so far and is very comfortable. I like the looks and feel of the watch. The only minor nit is the date window is very small. I'm very satisfied with the quality and the price."
3,Date Window is too small,"This watch is nice looking. I am sure it will keep accurate time. However, two things to consider: 1. The date display at the bottom is extremely small and even with a magnifier in the crystal, you really cannot see the date. 2. The clasp on the band can be improved. It catches on clothing because it will not close to a smooth position."
5,Affordable - a Great Fashion Statement -- Great Time Piece,"Skagen Men's Slimline Mesh Watch #233XLSGSI have purchased my first Skagen watch with duty free on a trip abroad; since then I was looking for another Skagen watch with a different watch face, this watch is not only affordable, by far lowest price, but a great fashion statement as well.The two-tone (gold-silver) with white face is strikingly handsome, more so, what I like about this timepiece is the adjustable fold-over with safety clasp band in matching color; the watch itself is very slimline, thin and easy to wear. The watch is truly an excellent time piece and beautiful piece of jewelry.Overall, I highly recommend everyone to own at least one of Skagen Timepiece."
4,economic but luxurious,"upon received the watch, delivered in time, I was a bit surprised.I didn't expect the quadran of the watch to be so big.But i got used to it in no time.The first tim etrying to tie the bracelet can be confusing. There is no clear indicationon how to operate. But if you are midly smart, you will figure it out.In all so far , I am very happy with this watch, considering the price, and everyonehas commented very nicely about it."
5,"I love it, and the service was the best!","The watch is the most comfortable watch I've ever worn. I've had them all Citizen's, Movado, casio, this is it. Wish I would have known sooner how nice these are."
5,Attractive watch at great price,"I've worn this watch daily for work for several years. It's strength is the thinness. I don't like jewelry, and don't like the feel of a watch. For that reason, I've been buying titanium watches for many years. This is just as light at a fraction of the price of my Seikos. The watch looks and wears well. The only thing i don't like is that the band is sectional with a double hasp. I prefer the one-piece design with the accordion expanders - the sectional/2-piece bands have to be held in place and clasped by the same hand at the same time. I wouldn't recommend the 2-piece band to those with arthritis. However, the watch looks and works great. recommended."
4,Very Elegant(cool watch),I love this watch I like the way it feels on my wrist but and here come the but the date on the clock should be remove since you can not see any how unless you have a maginfied glass besides that I love this watch who need to know what date it is we all have cell phone for that:)
1,VS developers: Stay FAR FAR away,"I rank this book among one of the worst computer books I have ever read. ... It is filled with redundant code, poor examples and plenty of bad jokes. This book was written for masochistic notepad coders who like command line compilers. For any Visual Studio developer looking for an excellent reference text, advice on proper coding strategies, and a book that is worth what you paid for it, stay FAR FAR away, as this book is none of the above and doesn't even acknowledge the existence of VS.NET."
1,poor quality,I had the watch about a half year and it died. I just stopped for no good reason.The watch looks great but the quality was terrible. I will never buy another Skagen.
3,Not as good as the model from two years ago.,The phone is getting cheaper in quality. I also have this version from two years ago and the older model is so much better in quality.
4,Great/reliable system,"I've had the system for years and wasn't sure if it would work in a bigger house - but it works brilliantly. I actually bought a system with higher (6.0) Ghz and it was not as good as this, I guess they don't make 'em like they used to."
2,Overpriced and no instructions,"It's overpriced for what it is--a handset for a wireless phone (not a cell phone), but Panasonic said no other manufacturer's phone will work with my Panasonic base unit, and I needed an additional location. I don't notice anything special about voice quality, build appears to be sturdy, it has a number of features, but comes with no instructions on what they are, let alone how to use them. At this price, it should have."
5,does what it needs to,"I have been happy with this phone system since I used it to replace a previous Panasonic whose line-selection buttons had stopped operating. The menus are intuitive and the features are fine. I haven't activated the answering system yet, but I have received a call on it, since the phone has a default of answer on. Seemed to work well. The small form factor of the base unit was attractive to me. I needed to customize which phones and which lines rang, since I have a home office I try to close at reasonable hours, and it was possible to do that with this system."
4,For All Amoricans!,"Like most Amoricans out there...I couldn't wait to get my hands on Cabin Fever. ""Before The Frost...Until The Freeze"" CD captured live on DVD. I found it to be very laid back. I was hoping for more of the older Crowes style, but was very impressed with the dynamics and chemistry that these guys have developed over the years. I've been a big fan since the first album came out. I've seen a lot of their live shows. Cabin Fever hit me different. I've watched it a few times since my purchase. It has grown on me a great deal. I like the direction that the Crowes have taken. With that being said....I am a true Amorican, and that I will continue to follow that direction with them. Peace!"
5,Rocking Hula,"Wish I could put one on my bike! This is a very nice dashboard Hula, should have ordered a second one."
4,Good brand.,"I know the quality of Max Factor. It really helps to strech and seperate as advertised. The only thing I did not like, it is a bit dry mascara and take some time to use it."
3,ok serves its purpose,its more of a collectors item than a toy not very durable. I havnt dropped it yet and dont want to it will most likely break
5,A Magnificent Account of the History of Mathematics,This milestone in the history of mathematics-history covers mathematics from its recorded beginnings to the end of World War I. It is a synthesis of remarkable historical and mathematical scope. Professor Grattan-Guinness has established a new paradigm of excellence in the field of mathematics-history.
1,A BIG BOMB AND A STINKER FOR TOM CRUISE!,This movie is nearly 3 hours of hot air as bad as the movie The Hindenburg! If George C Scott saw this movie he would be rolling over in his grave! I yawned so much that I got a charley horse in my neck and nearly had a stroke from being bored to tears! Saddam Hussein should be strapped in a chair and be forced to watch this movie- maybe then would he confess of his atrocities that he committed! Stay as Far and Away from this movie as you can!
5,first falling love,"Sometimes we need a dream not realized yesterday. Like the unbearable lightness of being, we still insist a day the first time we met"
3,Good but foreseeable plot,"Far & Away- A love story that shows that love will always triumph as long as both live. I found it to be a bit too sweet & to telegraph its plot too often. I was pleased with the work of Tom Cruise however. His only better role being in The Last Samurai.His voice work was notable & enjoyable. The most disruptive scene being the one that destroys the drama of the last scene. They should not have used that twice in the movie. It's a similar complaint to what I had with The Lord of the Rings.It is certainly a watchable movie & I can recommend it for one viewing but it would be difficult for me to watch it twice. There are good performances, the best of which is given by Robert Prosky, a 'second banana' actor worthy of note. You can catch more of him in a comedy called Outrageous Fortune & a horror movie called The Keep. If you love sweet endings this could well be a repeat viewing for you. I give it 3 Amazon Stars."
5,Alice's most underrated.,"This was the first Cooper album I ever owned. I know, an odd start to get into Alice Cooper, but it's a really good album. If it's one thing, it's catchy. Coming in at under half an hour, the album holds your attention all the time between the melodies and some of Alice's most insane vocals and lyrics ever. IMO, essential Alice."
2,"Not too good, really...","I have every Alice Cooper album - many on both CD and vinyl. I'm a fan of almost all of his music, both by himself and with the original AC Band. Also, I absolutely LOVE the three albums that followed this (Special Forces, Dada, and Zipper Catches Skin). ""Flush The Fashion"" is a dud, though, in my opinion. I have tried and tried and tried for years to get into it, and as my tastes in music have evolved and expanded, I still haven't been able to find FTF to be a good listen. While many reviewers give credit for crossing from hard rock to New Wave, to my ears, it just didn't work here. ""Clones"" and ""Pain"" are indeed gems, and I listen to them often. But I consider this to be an album strictly for completists - those two tracks could be downloaded, or are available on ""The Life & Crimes of Alice Cooper"" box set. Do yourself a favor and skip this one unless you absolutely feel the need to have it. Sorry, Alice."
4,Surprise! Surprise!,"I have avoided Alice's ""Flush the Fashion"" for years due to negative reviews. Anyway, I picked it up on a whim with a few other of the more obscure Cooper albums. Ok, ok...this is a REALLY rockin' album, and I was totally surprised. It was produced by Roy Thomas Baker (The Cars) so it has a little of that vibe/sound, but it's undeniable Alice. I wish I had got this sooner. The way each track effortlessly segues into the next is great and the song Clones (We're All) is one of Cooper's best. There is plenty of humour throughout these tight punchy numbers. For example, check out the tunes, Aspirin Damage, Model Citizen and Grim Facts. Check it out you may be surprised, like I was..."
4,Prophetic Inspiration,"Prophetic Inspiration - You can tell when music is birthed out of a worship relationship, because it speaks to your spirit. Thank you for writing from your spirit and birthing a sound that is truly from the heavenly realm. This cd stimulates the prophetic anointing within!Would love to see performance tracks for this artists."
2,Miyazaki Book's is a droll,"This is a really bad book if you ask me. I read half way through and I was extremely bored. All I kept seeing were several words repeated. I thought this book would give an insight to the Yakuza world and how it functions,etc. Like the foundations. This is nothing but a simple, lame recap of a guy who went through some semi-yakuza and other dealings. Some of the details, for like 150 pages are his high-school/university demonstrations. I mean, how boring is this!. The title is about his involvement in the underworld, yet half the book is merely about demonstrations, JCP, etc etc. If you want a fun read- read Confessions of a yakuza- that is excellently written, and the story will keep you entertained. I could not pick up Toppamono after the 150th page. It was just too boring, I felt like skipping pages. What a waste of a buy."
3,Not entirely informative,"I really wanted a video that was self explanatory. This isn't. I also could swear that the ""breath in-breath out"" commentary doesn't match the sword master's breaths and hand movements. Impossible to tell if I'm doing anything correctly."
5,Thank you,There are many things I like about this DVD - it will serve me for many years. Thanks to YMAA for top quality in all aspects.
3,Honest Illusions,"Not one of my favorites. This book is about magicians and thieves, and I wasn't very interested in the subject matter, but I also wasn't crazy about the characters either. It starts in the past with Max Nouvelle and his young daughter Roxanne as they travel around performing magic. When they happen upon small time thief Luke Callahan, they take him in and make him part of their family developing his skills along the way. The story takes us thru their lives, as Roxanne and Luke grow and discover love while honing their magic and skills in theft."
3,half-perfect,"this is the first nora roberts long novel i've read (i tried her category romance before) and i must admit i got hook with the first half. roberts has the ability to captivate her audience with her characters. but the flashback is tooooo long. there are so many unnecessary plotpoints. she should have cut the flashback and get back to the present. and the motivations of the characters in the second have became muddled. luke callahan agreed to disappear but in the next chapter, he appeared again (though five years had elapsed). and why can't he tell roxanne the truth? that he had been set up and blackmailed by the antagonist! and why can't roxanne tell luke that they have a child. this what pisses me off! when characters keep secrets from other characters. and i can't believe that the villain sam wyatt, after years of planning revenge, just asked luke to disappear. aw, c'mon!"
2,slow for a Nora Roberts book,This book was recommended to me by someone who reads and loves Nora Roberts. I checked the rating here at Amazon before starting the book. I was totally disappointed with this book. It was slow and somewhat boring and I cannot see how it earned a 5 star rating.

4,"A Sense of the Call: A Sabbath Way of Life for Those Who Serve God, the Church and the World","As a pastor's wife and one who serves the church personally, I resonated with this message. Some of the insights that should be obvious were profound at this point in my life. I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and am finding rest a vital part of my healing and restoration. Marva's emphasis on revitalizaion and renewal now as a foretaste of heaven have encouraged me to evaluate my life rhythm. I appreciate her vulnerability and honesty in her own struggles. I have recommended this book to others who have also found it helpful."
3,Curious collection of bizarre monstrosities,"Here's the compendium of some of the most bizarre creatures ever found in D&D - this set includes the minions of Chaos that come ""from beyond""... not only are they fun for pure Dungeons & Dragons, but we've successfully run a D&D/Cthulhu campaign using these beasties as the main source of terror. Too much fun, and hard to find!"
2,Rating for this DVD ..Where are the Extras?,"Another great movie without all the extras fans deserve to have.First off this version of this film has been out for a very long time now and needs it's own ""Rejuvenation"".This DVD is the full screen format (Yuck) and the picture suffers from grain and the colors seem to be blah.In the back of this DVD box as well as the VHS you can witness a still of a scene which isn't included in the film, but is in the trailer you can see another scene in motion thats not in the original film. This gives the notion that the film had some extra running time and had been cut right before it's theatrical release.Ok Universal please re-master this very funny film and please include a new widescreen transfer with loads of extras Incuding those sceens that had been cut! A commentary also would be great with the director and cast!Death Becomes this current DVD release."
2,Must have a good book Editor,I expected more as I have his book in my library. Seems a little old fashion and out of touch. I kept looking for the pinkie ring.
5,"Plain, Simple, Old School",Just like the old style bookends in the library. They were cheap and work great for all my daughters books.
4,Good Movie,"I saw this movie when I was 17 years old. This movie is a mystery as to who is the love of Ludwig's life and it's a former student of Ludwig who is set to the task of solving the mystery of who she is.You may have to see it twice to ""see"" how the ""mistake"" or ""mishap"" happened but it's a very good movie.Plus, I loved it so much that I bought the soundtrack. Now, my children know Ludwig's music, which is a wonderful thing."
2,Ahhhhhh!,"This is what I was screaming during the movie. It was so annoying! You had to sit there forever watching things that are pointless to you until the end of the movie. You spend at least two hours doing nothing but staring at it blank faced. What for? Simply to find who Beethoven was writing love letters to! Even if you like classical music, don't watch this. I like it, and still I hated it. If you don't mind watching long, pointless movies, watch this. I think whoever said watching Amedeus is better, she or he is right!"
2,Gary Oldman can't carry this mediocre bio flick,"Gary Oldman is a fine actor who has portrayed Lee Harvey Oswald, Sid Vicious, Joe Orton, Count Dracula, and here, he impersonates Beethoven. That's what's known as ""range."" But this picture demonstrates why, despite his gifts, he isn't a big star - he just doesn't have that indefinable screen presence that enables even inferior actors to carry a movie. Here he doesn't do much but scowl, rant, and behave like a ""genius."" It's always hard to play a great man convincingly, and it doesn't help that the real Ludwig van was a deeply unpleasant shnorrer unlikely to win the viewer's sympathy. Do yourself a favor and fast forward the video 1 hour 13 minutes to watch the great Barry Humphries as Metternich. It's the best 45 seconds of the film, and I suspect Humphries, a modern dandy, accepted the role because it gave him an excuse to wear a splendid frilly cravat."
4,Dr Who,I love my sonic screwdriver and use it every time I watch Dr Who. It came quickly and the box had no dents or anything.
2,A Dud,"I expected it to be a plastic toy, so I wasn't surprised by the screwdriver's physical condition. The product description needs to be changed to reflect that it doesn't come with the psychic paper. The one I got must have been a dud, because it doesn't work. No lights, no sounds, just a neat-looking toy. It's cool to have it just to have it but I'm sooooo bummed that the bells & whistles don't work. :("
4,Great Office Tool!,"As an engineer it's great to finally have a tool that does pretty much anything I need it to, except work on wood, that'd be nice in a future model. I use it to fix my everyday problems such as heating up my cold coffee or those rare alien office invasions. All around it is a great desktop accessory."
5,Dr. Who,"Great item, love it, great purchase thru amazon. my daughter loves this item.Would highly recommend.Nice buying thru amazon, fast shipping"
4,Decent,"I'm a huge Dr Who fan, and David Tennant is my hero. That said:This is the full size toy. Same size as in the movie. Some of the other ones on the net are the tiny 3"" long basically keychain trinkets.It has ok sound for a toy replicating a movie, but it's not quite as cool as the movie sound. Still kinda coolThis is of course made of cheap plastic, but the best you're going to get at this price. What were you expecting, metal? If you were going to use it as a prop when going to a sci-fi convention, I would dirty it up some to make it look aged and rugged, instead of shiny plastic. Maybe use some dye or paint effects on the nooks and crannies on the handle?The UV ink is invisible, and the light does illuminate it perfectly. Cool for kids I guess."
4,A good toy for what you pay for.,"While a bit cheap looking and the light is dim, it otherwise looks great and is fun to mess around with. The uv pen and light work to make secret messages. In all, cute for play and fun."
4,"Great, but lightwight and made of plastic.","This is more of a novelty item than a toy... When I got, it I buzzed it a few times and then locked it away for safe keeping.... Its a great replica, but isnt very heavy duty and seems like it will break with heavy usage. Nice to look at and then add to collection."
4,"a bit wibbly wobbly, but a good timey-wimey device to have","is as described, perfect for a Whovian collector, or costume piece, or just for sonic-ing those pesky stuck doors. locks that is, it wont work on wood... just keep in mind that it is plastic and slightly flimsy"
5,This is the one!,"Go forth and Google, and check it out: This is the toy that was made from the prop that so impressed the prop that they switched. Yep, the one on TV is a version of this toy, recast and hand-finished.Too much fun.I have been stopped once while flying, and the TSA guy said, ""What's this?""""It's a sonic screwdriver... And a pen.""""Cool."""
3,"Great for Children, but not for older fans",This was a bit of a impulse buy for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. I read a few reviews but not closely. Its a great toy and is the ability to write in invisible ink is cool. Though I'd have to say I was expecting a little higher of quality of plastic. This would make a better gift for a younger WHO fan. Its defiantly a good gift for a younger person who is less picky about quality. It defiantly be cool for secret notes. Its a great gift just not for an adult.
3,Sound Fx,"When i bought this Sonic Screwdriver i was really excited for it. I was amazed by the packaging label and the pen and uv ink nib. But i was a little bit disappointed because of the sound, the sound was a soft buzz and quieter that the 11th Doctor Sonic Screwdriver... After 1 week or 2 weeks the sound was gone, i wasn't messing or playing the sound that much... So i figured out the small speaker thing is busted or something, because i know that the battery is brand new. Anyways i really love this Sonic Screwdriver its really good for writing and signing anything, but 1 tip i should tell, Do not play with the sound like every other 5 minutes because you might worn out the speaker. (:"
5,For Dr. Who fans.,Another of my many collection pieces. Altho I will say it does feel a little cheaply made it's nothing that I'm worried about as I'm only using it as a collectors piece... but for all the people who want to use it for a pen or to play with in general I have to admit it wouldn't take too much to break it.
4,If only it worked like the real one:),"As a kid, I dressed up as the 4th Doctor and had to use a mechanical pencil as the Sonic Screwdriver. Now, as an adult dressing up for parties as the 10th Doctor, I can have a much more believable prop!Of course, as many of the other reviews have noted, the construction of this product is somewhat flimsy for what the price should afford, and the pen nibs don't connect very securely. But by far the biggest disappointment is that it doesn't really take out screws, unlock doors, or take readings for alien life forms:) Guess we can't have everything.That being said, it is a lot of fun to play with and to use it to write secret messages to my wife and sons. The sound and light are great bonuses."
3,cheaper than i thought,"eleventh dr. who screwdriver is better done than this one. so i wonder about that- but i love the tenth dr. so i bought this one too. by comparison this one is really small and kinda cheap plastic-y. the other one is plastic too, just feels so much better. They could have done a much better job. boo. keep looking for a better tenth dr. sonic screwdriver. this one costs too much for what you get."
5,Mother of a Whovian,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, one of her favorite gifts. She keeps running around and pointing it at things, making the noise. Teenagers!"
3,"OK, but should be cheaper.","I got this for my 5 year old, who loves Doctor Who almost as much as his dad. The black cap and little pieces were all lost within a day, of course. What's left of it has lasted a month, so far, so I guess it's more durable than it looks. It looks and feels rather cheap and if it wasn't an official Doctor Who product, it would cost about $5. Still, if you want it, what choices do you really have?"
4,Dr. Who,This is not supposed to be an educational toy - just a fun one. It is a great gadget/toy for adults as well as chidren.
3,What you'd expect,"I was hoping that it was metal instead of plastic, but what could you expect? I was hoping for more than one sound effect, but what could you expect? I was hoping it would be easier to assemble, but what could you expect? Lower your expectations, and you won't be disappointed."
4,Doctor Who SonicScrewdriver,"I purchase this item for my Costume as a prop for Comic Con, and I was happy to get as fast as I did before the day I was supposed to get it. Sadly the item I had purchase was not the one on the picture that was shown and that really needs to be fix for future sales. It did not come with the wallet as explained in the Product Features or the Product Details. I am not sure why it would come with the UV pen to write with if they did not sale the wallet to go with it. Otherwise the Sonic Screwdriver itself seems fine I not really going to be playing with it but it dose serve for what I need it for."
4,Not bad. Better than a lot of licensed toys.,"One of my greatest pleasures has been introducing my young son to all of the geeky things that I love. He's taken to them like bees take to flowers. By far, his favorite geeky thing is DOCTOR WHO. I was so thrilled to be able to order him his own Sonic Screwdriver and he was absolutely tickled when he received it.So, for a kid who loves WHO, the toy is great. I only noticed one sound, not two, but it was authentic and not loud enough to be annoying to parents. Also, mine didn't have the ""Psychic Paper"" pad for some reason. Still, the UV ink nib worked well, which was a big plus to my son. It seems sturdy enough, save for the pen tips, which I suspect won't stay on for long. It isn't quite as detailed as I would have hoped, but, again, I'm an adult. My son never noticed. When he picked it up, he became a Time Lord. In the end, that's what's important."
3,"No bang, pop, or fizzle","I was so excited when I knew my sonic screw driver was at my door step. It was awesome and bigger than I expected when I first opened it, but as I opened it something seemed off. I plugged in the batteries and triple checked that they were correct and then I pressed the button. And disappointment, there was no sound at all coming out. Light was bright and the batteries were in correctly, but no sound. There isn't a point to buying a sonic screwdriver that doesn't had that trademark sound. In other words in very disappointed :("
4,Slightly Crooked.,"It might have just been mine, but the top bit of the screwdriver was slightly crooked. I fixed it with a bit of Scotch tape, but it still bothers me a little. Also, the light sometimes doesn't work and I have to tap it to get it to come on. Otherwise, it's pretty awesome, and totally worth the buy."
1,Complete waste of 3 great actresses' talent !,"I'm a big fan of Chinese action movies, but this is by far the worst. most amateurish film I've seen this year. What are Muchelle Yeoh and Maggie Cheung doing in this disaster of a superheroin movie? Ridiculous plot, cheap production values, weak effects.The incoherent direction does not help either. And please don't tell me it's supposed to be campy. It's not, just plain bad. Avoid at all costs!"
2,Too bizarre to take seriously (which is not a bad thing),"This campy cult classic has it all: superheroes, compulsive professors-invertors, ghosts, demons and human-flesh-eating babies. ""Heroic Trio"" is a mix of so much and many that unless you're willing to immerse in Ed Wood-like weirdness you shouldn't watch this movie. If you like Ed Wood and/or if you enjoyed the movies like ""Killer Condom"", ""Tromeo and Juliet,"" or ""Batman and Robin"" this movie is for you."
3,"Hilarious, Hokey Chop-Socky Fun","In Hong Kong, someone is stealing babies from local hospitals. Out of nowhere to help save them are a masked avenger who runs along buildings and telephone wires (Anita Mui) and a brash, but beautiful bounty hunter (Maggie Cheung). They soon find out that the culprit is a woman with the power of invisibility (Michelle Yeoh) and that they all share a link in their past. THE HEROIC TRIO is unusual in that it is the women who are the action-heroes, thus predating characters like Xena and Buffy. However, like most martial arts films, this film is very over-the-top and pretty hokey. The fighting scenes are eye-catching and both Mui and Yoeh take their roles fairly seriously. Maggie Cheung's bounty hunter, however, seems in on the joke and hams it up big-time. This ain't a great film, by any means, and there have been better super-hero type flicks. However, for a couple of hours it provides its share of laughs and thrills. Recommended if you like this sort of film."
2,Porter Cable Screw Gun 4634,Just received the Porter Cable screw-gun / driver. It is covered in oil.Presumably this is the same defect mentioned elsewhere in these Amazon reviews.Since it is such an obvious defect -you can feel it & see it brand new in the box(!) you wonder about the quality control of all the other aspects of this tool.I bought this because it is Made in USA even though the Harbor Freight (chinese) equivalent is about 1/3 of the price.Disappointed.
4,Great Short Read,"Gave as gift to brother in law - he of the story teller type.Said his brother in West Virginia would find it amusing, seeingshow he is such a story teller himself."
1,clumps!,I guess it's old or something but I had to throw it away after two uses because it clumped on me and made me look like some televangelist's wife! I have used this product for years and it never did that before!
3,good reference but dated.,a good reference with examples to show. but a little outdated now in 2010.
3,down the river,"love abby, but other works are better. He is great in Desert Solitaire and most of his other works. I tend to skip the political musing."
3,Beware of cheap screws,Beware of cheap screws! I spent too much time removing stripped screws. The bar is perfectly fine. Just be prepared to use your own screws.
1,mr. mom,"This movie is about a guy named Jack that loses his job at a car factory. Jack thinks he will be able to get a job easy and he bets his wife a hundred dollars that he can get a job before her. She ends up getting a job at an advertising place. Which makes it so he has to stay home with the kids. Jack has no clue about anything that he has to do like grocery shopping, taking the kids to school, and doing laundry. Jack's wife's boss tries getting her to marry him. The movie was most likely extremely funny during the time it was made, but to watch it now it is very boring and definitely not funny. But this is also just my opinion. The stuff that is suppose to be funny is actually just plain stupid, like Jack cooking a cheese sandwich with a iron or having the TV repair person come see what's wrong with his TV after he kicked his foot through the screen."
1,this is,"when rotting christ beggined to decay, anyone who liked their previous works know that, they became ""fancy"" and ""nice"", betrayers of the underground. I respect their way of doing thins, anyone has a different mind. But this is not a black metal release, it cannot be called that."
2,Not The Soupy I Knew,"I watched & listened to Soupy for years and saw him in person a couple of times and he was always telling jokes that were fall down laughing kind of material. I was disappointed after receiving this collection as it contained very , very few of those type jokes. Very little that's funny in here. Dennis/Canton Mi."
1,Audio is Always OUT OF SYNC,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ... files generated have horribly out of sync audio and El Gato has no fix for it. Do your own research and you will find out that this product does not work as advertised.
2,Not worth the money ... sorry,"I have used this product for over a year now, and can honestly say that it's not worth the money.Transcoding video is faster (tried MacBook Pro and Mac Pro) and more flexible (more options in settings and such) when doing it without the Elgato Turbo ...This might be a product useful for G3 owners?"
1,Known bugs in firmware,"I recently bought the Turbo.264 and was VERY disappointed in the results. I was initially impressed with the speed until I saw the output of the movie. Big blocky picture output which made it unviewable. I tried a few times after that, with different sources (all unencrypted DVD's, still getting the same result).Technical Support at Elgato was not much help as they told me it probably had to do with a bug in the firmware. They sent me a link to a new beta firmware update, but it was the same result.I am very disappointed in this. As of right now, it is useless to me and it's not even heavy enough for me to use as a paperweight. I'm back to using Handbrake for now."
5,Perfect for family Devotions,I would recommend this book for any family looking to spend some time intentional in the Word of God and contemplating the things of god. Using the Shorter Catechism makes the Scriptures relevant today. Each daily devotional is short but well written. Very enjoyable!
5,Saw this remake before the original.......,"If everyone thought the same, life would be boring.I saw third remake with Bridget Fonda befor ethe original.....This is by a long way an improvement....my only criticism is that some of the shoot out scenes are OTT.....but perhaps not much more than those with Jack Bauer in 24!!Loved it!!"
2,Doesn't compare to the original,"If you're thinking of seeing this movie, bag it and watch La Femme Nikita instead. Nikita is a smart, sexy movie that doesn't degenerate into a plain vanilla action film, as does Point of No Return. The ""dumbing down"" of the original film for an American audience is insulting.In addition, the acting in the original is far superior to that in PoNR. Bridget Fonda isn't believable as a tough street girl, and while I enjoy watching Gabriel Byrne in most films, his portrayal of Bob pales in comparison to Tcheky Karyo."
1,Why waste your time with a lousy remake?,"I went to see this movie without realizing it was a remake of Nikita. Poor me! The original captured French cynicism, class and style, and was pretty gripping. Take away these elements, and nothing remains. The movie moves along in a tired, uninspired way, the actors are unconvincing at best."
2,LA FEMME FONDA,"The gutsy performance of Bridget Fonda is the only saving grace of this ultra-violent, nihilistic remake of the French hit LA FEMME NIKITA. Director John Badham manages to keep the action tense and suspenseful, but the writers expect a lot from viewers. How can one truly identify and/or empathize with Fonda's character? She's really a cold-blooded killer, with little grace or worth. Even after her Pygmalion like transformation, she is still the same ruthless woman, only we are now supposed to sympathize with her and wish her well? This reviewer can't do that. Gabriel Byrne struggles gamely with his likewise unlikeable character; Dermot Mulroney only manages to look goofy in his puppydog idolization of Fonda; and poor Anne Bancroft tries to be the cold, but caring, mentor. It's to Fonda's credit that she manages to at least get us in her corner, guiltily or not."
1,What was Harvey Keitel thinking?,La Femme Nikita La Femme Nikita La Femme Nikita This re-make only goes to prove Hollywood thinks its American audiences are a bunch of morons who won't read subtitles. See La Femme Nikita instead. Anne Parillaud (french version)makes a convincing and sophisticated natural born killer while Bridget Fonda looks like a doe trapped in someone's headlights.
5,Great movie!,"Bridget Fonda has one of her best performances in this well done remake of the original ""Nikita"" movie. The movie has a good pace and the overall acting is well done. Fonda as Claudia plays her part very well from her transformation to her personal human impact on her profession. If you are a fan of the action/thriller genre this is a must see flick. Harvey Keitel is the coldest cleaner you will ever see."
2,Gift for Wife,"My wife wanted this movie for her collection. It is a good movie, but I have not seen her watch it much."
1,Look elsewhere...,"We just spent a week in Moab, this book had numerous errors and was no help in selecting hikes. We ended up using the Moon guidebook for Zion and Bryce, which also covers the Moab area. I should have paid attention to the other reviews...."
5,"Intelluctual, but just as good as the original.","This book really makes me want Card to write The Hive Queen, The Life of Human, and The Hegemon. It would make the book much better, even though it already is an amazing book. That's the only bad part about it. It's not long enough. If it was 10,000 pages it would be to short. You never want this book to end. The story is just much too good. It provides a wonderful perspective on life. It's truly amazing."
5,For your own humanity,"I expect good science fiction novels to offer complex worlds, unusual characters, and fascinating moral dilemmas. For me, not only did the book fulfill the above criteria, but it also changed my own ethical stances on a number of issues--and it was a painful change. The characters (alien and human) face the classic problems of cross-cultural interaction and misunderstanding. In this book you will find compassion blended with selfishness, humility juxtaposed with moral righteousness, instincitve horror transformed into sympathetic understanding. Ender Wiggin, the genius strategist/xenocide/diplomat, comes to this realistic mess of a situation and demonstrates the wisdom of a man who has made the deepest mistakes and participated in the most horrible of crimes. I loved Ender's Game and thought it was brilliant. But the Speaker for the Dead is not simply brilliant and engrossing, it is an argument for the deep, extraglobal consequences of failing to be honest with oneself."
3,An average followup.,"It is worth reading, if one has read the prior book in the series. However, it is no an excellent book, and has a few flaws. I find the whole Catholic church angle irritating, and frankly a bit uncomfortable; like someone going on and on about some inside joke or obsession. It did not work for me at all.Most of the characters are frankly not all that interesting to me. The family which the book focuses on, well... They are not all that easy on the nerves. Their quirkiness also wore on my nerves.It is a nice story of retribution however, and I did like that quite a lot. The scenes where Ender and his close ""friend"" worked together were very good. And the idea of a speaker for the dead is an excellent one. So there is a lot in this book that is good.But all in all, a letdown and the last book of the series I will be reading."
4,Different but still good,I was expecting this book to be similar to Ender's Game. It turned out this book was nothing like Ender's Game but was still a very good read.
3,"Pretty good, But not great","You need to read Ender's Game first, and then read this, but going from Ender's Game to this book is a big change. But it's a must read if you read Ender's Game. I would rent it from the library."
2,Really lame.,"This story was most definately well written... But if you really enjoyed Ender's Game, you're far better off reading the ""Ender's Shadow"" spinoffs. Those were *awesome*. This book was enough to turn me off from all of the rest."
3,Not as good as Ender's Game,"After reading Ender's Game, I was left waanting to know what happened with Ender and the baby hive queen. So I read Speaker for The Dead. I thought that this book was good but was too long and kind of a let down after Ender's Game. The book had no action and had weird names that made it hard to read. The only cool thing about this book was the piggies, Jane, and Ender. Time travel was a good idea and the only way that this book is possible, but the fact that it would take 50 years outside the space ship made time travel a little pointless. Even though I didn't think this book was very good i still recommend it to anyone who has read Ender's Game and is left wanting more. Now, I'm going to start reading Xenocide to find out how it ends, and hopefully it will be better than Speaker for the Dead."
3,Can Not Compete with Ender,"On its own this book is certainly worth reading, however as a sequel to Ender's Game, one of my all time favorate books, it is definitely lacking. Do not start reading this book expecting a masterpiece on par with Ender's Game or any of the Alvin Maker books"
2,piggies?,not as good as the first and very slow reading i kept waiting for it to get exciting but it never did
5,Great book,"This was a great book, much more philosophical than Ender's Game. You really need to read the author's intro to get a good sense of what the series becomes. It is a great insight. I really enjoyed the idea behind the speakers role and what this morphed into. This may be my favorite of the series so far."
5,One of my favorites,"Have you ever read a book and got the idea that the author is making you feel exactly what he wants you to feel, think what he expects you to think? I you ever have, then you know exactly what I'm talking about and understand how great a book that does that for you can be. Read this book just for the chance that Card could do the same for you"
5,OMG! books.have.WORDS!,"I'm being asked to give a functionality review....on a book. It's a book, it has letters that form words....which is exactly what I was hoping I would get. So yeah, I'm satisfied with my purchase lol. The only reason I'm not taking this seriously is because this is the third book and if you are buying it then you already love the series. What more could I possibly say? :)"
3,OK. Not ender's game,"And the obsession I found extremely annoying. Oh well. VASTLY better than the 3rd one, though. Stay away from it!"
4,Great Book!,"This is an increible book! Like Ender's Game, it has every thing good sci-fi requires. A MUST READ FOR FANS OF ENDER'S GAME OR ANYBODY ELSE!"
1,Not as good as Ender's Game,The writing becomes dull and overly religious. Ender's Game's plot was much more interesting. I loved Ender's Game and really wanted to read this book but it was very dissapointing.
2,"Good ship time, quality problem",The first 100 pages of the book are on the fringe of falling out. The glue holding them to the spine of the book was not strong enough apparently. Still a great book though that everyone should buy
4,"Not an adventure story, but a story of humanity","Unlike Enders War or Enders Shadow, this is not a combat adventure; it is about remorse and redemption. It is about respect for differences so different that you find them abhorent. It is about accepting things as they are and trying to make them better rather than giving up or feeling sorry for yourself. While the ""Enders"" books are ripe for teens, this book is for adults in that it is more thoughtful and more about preventing wrongful action as opposed to taking aggressive action."
2,"Sorry, but this doesn't even come close to Ender's Game...","Let me start off by saying I LOVED 'Ender's Game'...with that said, I just did NOT like 'Speaker For The Dead'. It had a place here and there that had me interested in the story and all...but this story is SO DIFFERENT from 'Ender' that it almost seemed like it was written by someone else. I liked the Orson Card I read in 'Ender' but if his writing style is more like what I read in 'Speaker' I'll just stay away from the rest of his books. I hoped against hope that 'Xenocide' would redeemwhat I felt, but sorry to say, it didn't. Now IF you like these books, I am truly happy for you, however they just didn't do it for me (I don't know why, but I was just bored with them). I have high hopes for 'Ender's Shadow' but after 'Speaker' & 'Xenocide' I'll await for the paperback before I buy it. Again my apologies to fans of these books. I'm not a bad guy, I just didn't enjoy the books."
3,Great book - execreble translation to e-format,"I was looking forward to rereading this series on my Kindle. I did enjoy revisiting an old favorite, but the publisher should be flogged for all the glitches in its formatting.(August 2010) After I submitted this review, Amazon delivered a revised version at no charge with most of the glitches taken care of. I would now recommend this version."
4,"Overall, I liked the L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara and ...","Overall, I liked the L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara and I would recommend the product to a friend. It made my lashes look thicker and fuller. However, I wouldn't say that it lived up to the advertised claim of lashes that are """"three times thicker and fuller."""" I appreciated that the mascara lasted and didn't smug during my aerobics workouts. I didn't like how the mascara clumped on the end of the brush when I removed it from the bottle."
4,Great drugstore mascara,"This is a great drugstore mascara! My lashes definitely look fuller when I wear this. I've only rarely had this mascara flake on me, and I haven't had it ""melt"" and leave black under my eyes. The mascara doesn't clump, although it does make my lashes stick together a bit. It's pretty easy to separate them, though. My only other complaint is the brush is bigger than the standard mascara size. I often forget this and end up with mascara on my eyelids. Still, I prefer this mascara to Great Lash and LashBlast, and I can't wait to try the waterproof version."
3,My rating for this product is just average. ...,My rating for this product is just average. It does what any mascara would do and nothing special in building volume or anything. I got black circles around my eyes using this mascara and I don't think I will continue using it.
3,"Not bad in itself, but...","...Most glaringly, it contradicts events earlier in the story - I'm thinking about the scene with Eladamri and the Oracle, where he appears never to have met her before. This is the same Oracle he was fighting alongside throughout Stronghold; he's next to her on the Awakening art. The characters are distinct, but a little two-dimensional in some instances - Crovax, previously a complex and tormented character anguished over what he was becoming, is now just a violent brute, while Ertai's arrogance has been taken to comic extremes in order to make his part in the story work. Nonetheless, this is for the most part a well-developed story with some interesting plot developments and it's nice to see Rath depicted in an appropriately dark way."
5,Magic the Gathering: Nemesis,"This is a must-have novel for Magic the Gathering gamers. The book is masterfully written and details the backgrounds of legendary characters. The book also sets the stage for the next 6 books. Gamers who have played with fourth and fifth edition characters will find this book informative and extremely gripping. In sum, this is a great addition to any fantasy library."
4,Chilling...,"I've read three magic books, the Rath and Storm anthology, Mercadian Masques, and Nemesis, and I can honestly say this is the most depressing one I've read of the three. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book, it will keep you guessing until the end. This book will also bring an end to a very important character, so if you're a fan of the series the book is a must. I just found what happened at the end of the book extremely creepy and disturbing, I won't ruin the ending for anyone who hasn't read it, but people who have, you know what I'm talking about. The book leaves things looking very bad for Weatherlight and all of Dominaria."
3,"Mediocre, at best...","Connie Podesta would probably be a great friend to have at one's local Toastmasters. She's funny. She's sharp.She can speak. And she's entertaining. But here's my problem: I purchased this item in hopes of gaining some wisdom, insight and skills in the area of people skills. After all, the title suggests that her topic is something about difficulties with other people, doesn't it? Instead, her talk and message, as I hear it, is unfocused and filled with warmed-over cliches that have been floating around the self-help circuits for decades. Sure, I know that I have to get used to difficult people and laugh away my troubles, but how about something else besides 'just deal with it!'"
2,Cutter needs to be better...tail & legs break off,"While I bought this cutter because it's shaped like a dachshund and we have two at our house, it needs a better design. The legs and tail break off too easily."
2,Eventually Dissapointed,"Very nice appearance and worked nicely for a year, but all of a sudden ate through batteries. We stopped the pendulum (and took out the second battery) and that has somehow corrected the problem. So the clock face is functional now, but we're bummed that it's not swinging. We have half a clock now."
4,Perfect for Beginners,"Being my first coin collection, not much to compare this with, but I'm quite happy. You won't be able to see both sides of each coin, however with a spot for Denver & Philly, I display one side for one mint and the other for the other mint. Don't try to work the coin into the slot by hand, you can easily crack the surrounding cardboard. Put a bolt on top of the quarter and use a small hammer to secure it in, and you'll have a perfect display."
4,Fifty State (District of Columbia and Territorial) Commemorative quarter folder.,It is a great place to store my Fifty State (District of Columbia and Territorial) Commemorative quarter folder. That all.
1,Not even delivered,"No specific comments, because I don't even have a chance to take a look. It's not delivered to the latest estimated time!"
4,fun for the kids,"true, the quarter slots are very snug, but i like the fact that it will hold all the state quarters in one book. Plus, it has lots of interesting info on the inside cover about all 50 states, and about the quarters themselves."
3,NOT SO DISAPPOINTED ANYMORE!,"I WROTE AN EARLIER REVIEW WITH A NEGATIVE RATING, AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A NEW ONE, JUST BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO GET THE QUARTERS IN THE SLOT. I HAVE ATHRITIS AND THE QUARTER ARE VERY HARD TO ENTER THE SLOTS, BUT I DO LIKE THE COVER AND P & D MINT SLOTS, I DO HAVE OTHER COIN BOOKS THAT ARE MUCH EASIER TO PLACE QUARTERS. SO I HOPE THAT MY REVIEW DIDN'T DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM BUYING THIS COIN BOOK,IF YOU DO, YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP."
5,Thoroughly pleased.,My order of Fifty State Commemorative Quarter folders arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks for great service and product quality.
5,What more can you ask for?,Works great and is at a great price. I can't think of anything else I would like to see.
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"This holder is the worst. You cannot fit the quarters in the holes. Yes, I would like for them to be securely held in place, but it should not take hours of frustration just to get them in. And when you do get them in, you've had to permanently crease the backing, or rip it, in order to do so.Do not waste your money on this."
2,Didn't hold my 2-year-old's attention,"***Parent Annoyance Meter Rating: 4*** (1= not annoying whatsoever, I would watch this without my child - 5=If I have to watch this again, someone better bring me a straitjacket)While most Barney DVDs have lots of singing and dancing, this one is pretty slow, especially at the beginning, and has too much talking. My two-year-old cries for me to change it every time I put it in. I am hoping that when she gets a little older she will like it. Its not one of my favorite Barney episodes either.I would recommend passing on this one and going for one of the Barney's that have more singing and dancing likeBarney - Let's Play School,Barney: Let's Go To the Farm,Barney Songs - From The Park,Barney - Movin' and Groovin'."
3,cargo river shorts,They were delivered in a timely manner and fit very well. I was pleased with the quality of material and workmanship.
5,Erika's Review!,"If you are a fan of Eartha Kitt then You should really buy this CD! The Timeless Classics ""Cha Cha Heels"",""Let's Do it"", ""C'est Si Bion"",""Uska Dara"" & So many More are on this CD!! If You Love Eartha Kitt Then Buy her CD! Cause I did & I Love it!!!!! :)"
2,Mainly for beginners,"Pros- if you know the topic, it's easy to find- explanations are short and sweet- good bathroom readingCons- very little explanation of the benefits- very little practical examples- not enough depthBottom Line:Buy it if you are new to Outlook or if it is worth a few bucks to learn a couple of new tricks."
4,Realistic Video,"Bought this for the bedroom and a 40"" LCD HDTV, lots of choices of fires and sounds plus music. Looks like a real fire, crackles and all. Would have gotten 5 stars but the fire actually burns down realistically but I would prefer it looped and always stayed roaring, I almost feel like I need to add a log towards the end...LOL. If you love the look and sound of a fireplace but can't have a real one this DVD will trick you into believing you have one."
4,Nice but widescreen would be better,"I purchased this to show on my LCD TV over the holidays last year. The sound effects and the picture are quite real, about as real as you can get with out the real thing. It would be improved if the picture were 16x9 native and I did not have to zoom or strech, though some of the different fires still look good with the zoom."
2,Fireplace overpriced,"While the service for receiving my video was excellent, I realized in hindsight I paid an awful lot of money for the video itself, which is only ongoing fireplace/music setups. I saw something similar in the dollar bin at Walgreens."
5,Lives up to expectation,"We have been talking about getting a ""Yule Log"" DVD for several years. When we finally decided to do it we read the reviews and this one sounded good. When we got it we discovered it actually did live up to the good things said about it. We particularly like the flexibility it offers. You can choose between several types of fireplaces and several types of music. We expected the music to be a bit on the cheesy side and it wasn't. All of the choices are actually quite good. It is a good quality product and we give it a very strong thumbs up."
