5,Love it!,"I've had this a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it! Easy to clean, easy to assemble, easy to use, pretty heavy so it stays on my counter, has some great recipes in the instruction book. Unless it breaks down on me soon, I have no complaints."
2,Burned Out,"Sometimes, racing games always seems to be exactly all alike from each other every single time. That comes within the feel of the race and thensome. For Burnout, the game actually seems to falter a bit through the lines. Largely because the game is one of the most lackluster video racing games ever. Not only that, the game also has its replays in crashes more likely than the game itself. Although they are nice, the feel of getting first place is really not there in this game at all. Instead, you're mostly draging around in the mud. The object of the game is for you to race and not only capture first, but also fill your boost meter to the max, by closely missing each of the ongoing cars. It does seem to falter a bit, and also the game is not the best in control. I strongly suggest you pass up this game, and instead get Mario Kart: Double Dash instead. You'll have a much better time."
4,O.K. But not O.K.,"I think this game is cool,but there are some bad things....THE BAD THINGS ARE:It is very fast.Long roads to travel.And, you have to race to get more roads.THE GOOD THINGS ARE:It is rated E {for everyone}.It will take a YEAR to finish the game.And I think you sould try it!..."
2,ok! Game,Well this game is ok! But its way too hard. I rented it last night and dident mind about it. It is easy to crash and way too easy to run out of time.
4,This game is going to be great,This game is cool... and I know my games and this looks like a very good game!Well I will be honest I do not like Crzay Taxi the same people that are making this game for GameCube but this game is not a timeing game so i hop this game is cool.The game is cool for ps2 and I really like it for ps2!If this companey is reading this make a nascar game!
1,Turnbull's The Forest People,"I'll keep this short. I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read. The author has really missed the mark on making this book a pleasurable read or an informative ethnography... it needs to be one or the other, because it fails miserably at both."
1,What a flop !,"I cannot agree more with the other posters. I am glad that I watched this trash on SCI FI and didnt pay for it.It just kept going on and on with no point. No one ate etc for how many days. The special effects were anything but special. Telephones etc r supposed to be ""dead"" bcse of the rays but car radios and some televisions are working lolBuildings were exploding but there werent any people, In fact, there were no real mob scenes of people running for their lives.If 2012 really does happen, I say toss the original and any copies of this trash into a pit !"
3,Slightly less than perfect,"Gutterflower definitely sounds like it was a struggle. Its brooding, dark, and angry. The biggest mistake is the ""Na Na"" section of ""What a scene,"" which stretches on for about 2 minuets. Don't get me wrong. I love the Goo Goo Dolls, but, this album doesnt stand up to the wonder that was Dizzy up the Girl. Gutterflower has solid material, and awesome production, but the standouts are few and far between. I guess what I mean to say, is that they won't be reaching a broader audience with this record. The standouts are ""Big Machine"", ""Here is Gone"", ""What do you need?"", and ""Truth is a Whisper"". All were written by Rzeznik, and all have that certain touch of grey that is required for a good angsty rock song. To sum things up, a solid, if not broad effort."
4,Great sell-out cd,"Although many Goo Goo Dolls fans may see their love ballads as a sell out to their previous Offspringesque punk days, I for one am a fan. Johnny's lyrics cut to the chase, you wouldn't think that a guy could feel such pain in Sympathy or Here Is Gone (especially with the upbeat style), but he does. Whether it was due to his recent relationship, Johnny sings what every girl wants to hear and what, I hope, all guys eventually feel. I've listened to their ""Ego"" CD and I am definitely a fan of their ""sell out"" music that parallel the likes of Matchbox 20 and LIfehouse. ""Dizzy Up the Girl"" was a tough act to follow, but the Goos do it!!!"
3,Playing it (too) safe,"As a born and bred Buffalonian, I guess I'll always have a soft spot for our local music heroes, the Goo Goo Dolls. I must be fair and say that after ""A Boy Named Goo"", their sound has become a bit too overproduced and reek of radio-friendly blandness. And alas, with ""Gutterflower"", no risks were taken and the band appears to be treading water. The band opens with four incredibly strong tracks that are reminiscent of their best CD, ""Superstar Car Wash"", and had me prepared for perhaps a resurrection of my full-fledged fondness of the band. However, the next 2/3's of the album make you believe that you accidentally hit a button on your disc player, and tracks 1-4 are being replayed in sequence two more times. But don't sweat it Goos....your mentor, Paul Westerberg hasn't released anything consistent in a while, either. Maybe you should all collaborate together and release an album (after all, ""We Are the Normal"" is one of your finest moments)."
5,Their best album yet!!!,"Gutterflower is the Goo Goo Dolls best album yet. I've been a fan for several years now. I've bought the albums and seen the shows. Its all been great, but this album has to top the list. Its powerful and its soft. Its upbeat and its haunting. I hear traces of their musical styles from the past mixed with something so new, all coming together to make the most spectacular grouping of songs ever. I can't even get the right words out to describe how absolutely fabulous this record is."
5,Gutterflowers is from the heart!!,"With baited breathe I have awaited this CD, and it was well worth the wait!! There are at least 6 songs on this CD that are #1 hits and it was pure genious to begin with the first release, ""Here is Gone"". They haven't strayed far from the successfull Boy Named Goo and Dizzy Up the Girl. Each song has meaning in the brillant lyrics of Johnny Rzeznik and the melody compositions which they intereweave so well. My personal favorite is ""It's Over"" where Johnny sports a sultry baritone voice that reminds me alot of Chris Issaks in ""Wickid Games."" I think that Johnny is one of our most prolific songwriters of the Century and his guitar playing is equally impressive. They have proved that they are here to stay, and Gutterflowers is definitely satisfying to the most ardent Goo fan and the perfect introduction to future Goo fans. Highly recommended *****"
3,Hidden,"While the album is not without it's charms and soul-moving effects, I personally don't find it to be the Goos best work yet. It has a few wonderfully captivating songs that suck you in and delivers it's creative punch, but when looked at among their previous albums, such as Superstar Carwash or Jed, it seems to lack a new edge. Still, it is a nice album to listen to nonetheless, especially if you seek works of lyrical genius..."
5,Gutterflower,Great album. I like to listen to it to calm down or to become inspired. It is a good one to listen to while drinking a cup of hot coffee. Absolutely love it! Goo Goo Dolls are awesome.
5,The Goo's Do it Again!,"Rzeznik might be thinking of not doing this in fifteen years, and he will be missed. The poetic lyrics of Rzeznik and Takac are excellent. This is a must CD."
4,"Pop? Sure, but it sure sounds nice.","Bottom line: If you liked the last one, Dizzy Up the Girl, you will like this one. Very slick and polished at times, but you can't deny these guys know how to write a kick-[behind] pop song. Rzeznik's voice and writing fit the music like a glove, and it still has enough good guitar that you can convince yourself you are listening to good rock and roll. Nice, radio-friendly, rock that sticks in the head."
3,nice... But I expected more...,"After waiting 4 years I gotta say I expected much much more from this CD. I liked the wrapping much more then the music. I can say that I liked Jhonnie's ""sympathy"" (who's in my opinion the best song in the CD) ""here is gone"", ""what do you need"" and ""what a scene"". But I think that's it. Robbi's songs are so anoying in this CD! I think he's a graet artist but in this CD i gotta say he had failled badly, from a rock artist he turned to punk, if that's what he ment then fine he succeed, but it's still not what you'd expect from him. so I don't really recomend this CD, as a first GGD experience. As much as I love The Goo Goo Dolls musin I really think that their older CDs are better then this one."
5,Dolls Rock On,"The band's 8th CD may have more of a rock edge than the forever popular ""Dizzy Up the Girl,"" but the lyrics are just as emotional. ""Big Machine"" is the obvious standout on the album with lyrics like ""I'm torn in pieces, I'm blind and waiting for you."" Who can't relate to that? ""It's Over,"" another standout, tells the bitter tale of a relationship gone bad. The only ballad is a track called ""Sympathy,"" which is an apology song. ""Truth is a Whisper"" suggests that Rzeznik may be searching to ""believe in something."" Overall, Robby Takac's four songs are much better than his previous tracks. The best of Takac's songs is track #4, ""You Never Know,"" but his other three tracks prove to be catchy as well. I think this is one of the best albums I've ever heard, and the Goo Goo Dolls' deserve all the radio time that they get."
5,"Short, sweet jangle pop","The newest Lemonheads album is, as others have mentioned, a true return to form. The songs are short and don't overstay their welcome. Great toe-tapping tunes that bring a smile to your face. I highly, highly recommend this album for both new and old fans."
2,So close to being good,"I was looking forward to reading this, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. The book is very poorly edited, which caused me no end of distraction. It has the feel of a religious Harlequin romance novel, although religion never really shows up. I felt preached at. I wanted to know what happened to the characters, but felt like I was having to slog through the poor writing and editing to f ind out."
5,A Damm Good Book!,"Being a quilter myself, I was curious if this would be a good read. To my delight, it was one of the best books I ever read. I loved the way the author full described the quilting process. The relationships of the women are intense. I felt as if I knew them. I was so happy that this was a well-written book also. The author's use of language and description made it a pleasure to follow. I felt so connected to Sarah and her mother Carol. I highly reccomend this book to everyone! Thank you Jennifer Chiaverini."
4,Engaging and Intricate,This is the second in the Elm Creek Quilters series and it was delightful. I love how the author has pieced these women's lives together the same way a quilt is pieced and created. This particular book explores the relationships between mothers and daughters. It is engaging and as intricate as the quilt patterns it imitates.
1,BOMB!!!!!!!!!!,"...need I say anymore? Not worth a penny. If someone offers it to you at no cost, tell them to donate it to charity and get the write-off for one cent!"
2,Not compatible with Garmin ique m5,"I just purchased a garmin ique m5 and ordered the sandisk sd wifi card with 256 mb memory. I haven't used the sd card yet (still waiting for it to arrive). I emailed sandisk to find out if this is compatible with garmin ique m5, they replied and advised me not to use it because of driver issues. I don't know what to do now with this card when I receive it, there's no use for it."
1,CAUTION,"CAUTION: this is the P.M.-part of the ""A.M. & P.M. Yoga - Conditioning For Weight Loss"" DVD with Suzanne Deason, just with a different name :-("
5,GET IT,"THESE GUYS TOGETHER, don't get much better than this trust me please, you got to hear it to believe it."
3,Worth a chuckle,"In an uneven series of stories Sedaris displays the same irony and sarcasm that make his bits on NPR so good. These are confessional stories about his childhood and early adulthood, and mostly are stuff you'd never want anyone to ever know about you or your family. Some of the stories really are outrageously funny. As a collection, it drags a bit. These stories suffer from the lack of the particular lilt of the voice which makes him so terrific on the radio. Without having heard it I suspect the audio version of this would be quite a bit more entertaining."
4,"not totally ""true,"" but still great","For the first part of ""Naked,"" I found myself analyzing every sentence to guess what was true and what was embellished or made up. This book is more ""based on a true story"" than actually a memoir. But once you let go of having to believe every word, the outrageous exaggeration is just hilarious. It drags on a little in the middle, but it's hilarious most of the time."
4,David Sedaris Fan,"This is a great book to read. Not as funny as Me Talk Pretty One Day, but all of his books are excellent. I'm onto my 3rd David Sedaris Book in a month!"
3,Naked by David Sedaris,"Naked is my first book by David Sedaris and I was pleasantly surprised at how funny he is. His wit and humor provide many laugh out loud moments. In this series of essays, we learn about some of the author's trials from childhood through adulthood. He handles some pretty deep issues with a sense of humor, keeping them light and entertaining. In the end I found I enjoyed the first half of the book much more than the latter half. His interaction with his mother and other members of the family, while somewhat dysfunctional, also manages to be touching and funny. As he moves into his teen years and becomes adventurous, we learn of his exploits in the art of hitchhiking and vacationing at a nudist colony. This book does have a lot of ""bathroom"" humor, so I wouldn't reccommend it for the easily offended reader. I have heard that Me Talk Pretty One Day is his finest yet, so will definitely read that one."
3,Starts off strong but wanes at the end...,"Naked starts off so strong that I thought it would end up being Sedaris' funniest book to date. Unfortunately, the last two stories ended up being a bit long winded and somewhat dullish sort of drving on the autobahn and coming to a sputtering start. Still, that should not detract you from the odd Sedaris' tales of him and his family. His youthful fantasy pretesiousness, his wisecracking mother who imitates him to his teachers, his crackpot father and whacky siblings which included four sisters and a loose cannon of a brother nicknamed ""the rooster."""
3,Naked,"I bought this book because the author has been compared to Augusten Burroughs. While some chapters were really good, not all, it just didn't compare to Augusten's insane stories from cover to cover. However, if you like memoirs I recommend this one."
3,Eeehhhh?,This book was all over the place. It just wasn't very enjoyable to read. There were some funny stories though.
1,A disappointment,"David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers alive. But this book was just plain dull. What an incredible disappointment coming right after his amazingly hilarious book ""Barrell Fever."" Fortunately, he's redeemed himself in his latest work ""Me Talk Pretty One Day."" I'd skip reading Naked."
5,Favorite,"This is my favorite Sedaris memoir. I love everything he's written practically across the board, and I know I sound like a suck-up, but it's true. He amazes me with his ability to have me screaming with laughter (no, I am not nuts) one minute and the next chapter have me choking up."
3,Hmmm.,"I thought I'd enjoy this more, a little disappointing, mostly because I find him so entertaining on This American Life on NPR. This is the first Sedaris book I've read, I did enjoy most of the essays, but I got a little tired of the drug references and the ""woe is me"" stuff. I guess it's akin to why I never liked Al Bundy - always the loser, never a redemption. It didn't stop my from getting two more of his books, hopefully I will enjoy those more!"
4,Morbidly funny,"So funny that you want to pass it along, but so dark you want to keep it a guilty pleasure, David Sedaris' ""Naked"" is a laugh-out-loud take on the memoir. The rawness in which Sedaris looks at his life and family borders on maliciousnes and as a reader, you'll love every joke taken at the expense of Sedaris and his family. My personal favorite chapter is ""True Detective,"" which is not only funny but gives you an insight into just how twisted Sedaris' childhood was. Though many of the stories are clearly exagerrated, they are one of a kind. Sedaris' point of view on life isn't shared by most, especially if you're an optimist or even a happy person in general, but that's what makes his humor so good. So good, in fact, this book must be fattening."
5,Excellent,David Sedaris doesn't disappoint. His title story about a week at a nudist retreat was hilarious.
2,I guess the Yanks are quite different,"The short stories were nicely written, drawing on the presumed real life experiences of the author. As an author of humour, I found the style too self-consciously witty and trying to hard to be hilarious. In short, I found it tedious and barely raised a smile, let alone a chuckle and certainly not a belly laugh through the whole production. I put this down to the cultural differences between USA and Australia. It appears that readers in the USA have to be belted over the head and told when to laugh before they can appreciate humour. I prefer something more subtle. I am sure the author is a nice person, but there you go...."
2,Hard to Clean,"Just like everyone else I bought the cage for space for my hamster.We have only had the cage for a little over a month I'm returning it.Cleaning so it wont fall apart is impossible, I like to clean the cage every 5 days this one is so hard to keep together you have to re-build every time it's cleaned.I found my self letting it go longer because I knew how long it was going to take. I would not buy this product unless you have a lot of extra time for hamster cage cleaning.The plastic clip on the top broke the fist day we put it together."
2,3 floor habitat,Beautiful cage. I agree it's hard to put together and clean had mine only one week and the top has a crack in it from when I was trying to take it off to clean. On the plus side I got on sale at petsmart for 26 bucks. But if it breaks I don't think I would get the same one.
1,I Hate this Game!,I Hate this game so much here are a 4 reasons why this game sux wind!-The controlls sux!-when you hit other players in the private it makes a rubber ducky sound-Create a legend sux!-if your looking for a good wrestle game get wrestlemania 19 or X8
1,This Game Is The Worst Ever,"It has some Legendary wrestlers on it, but the gameplay is the worst Ive ever played. I am more used to the gameplay of games like wrestlemania 2000 and wwf no mercy. Do yourself a favor and rent this game before you buy it."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased a Saeco, Odea Go 1 1/2 years ago and it has blinked a lot and I was always able to control the blinking lights, now I took Brew group out and now you cannot insert it back. I have followed the instructions with no success."
1,Terrible quality,"I previously had a Saeco semi auto machine for 5 years, when it finally died I went with the Giro Go. Worked ok for about 13 months and then it started to leak and not produce good coffee. 18 months in it is now not working at all, and will cost over $300 to repair. Saeco's quality has declined over the 5 five years ... stay away from this machine as it's just not worth it."
3,The Flight of a Dove,"I think this is beautiful, based on a true story. Of course everyone is unique, and providing that this is a solution to all families that are dealing with autism is not true. However, I believe that is an okay simplistic description of a complex diagnosis."
2,A Disapointment,"I loved A Danish Girl--it's up there with my favorite books ever, and I'd love to write the screenplay. I looked forward to Ebershoff's new novel, but Pasadena is off-the mark. I loved the concept--I loved the first quarter of the novel, with the start of the Wuthering Heights romance, etc. Only, I feel like Ebershoff took so long writing this section that he ignored Bronte's pace . . . the book is LONG, and yet he never gets to the second generation's story . . . and our ""Heathcliff"" and ""Catherine"" never have their firey reunion w/ Catherine's mad scene . . . heck, he only barely brushes over Heathcliff's marriage to ""Edward's"" sister. Ugh. I looked forward to these scenes, only for the book to end on a flat note. Could've been good, I wish he'd try again and think about plot a little more. The generational saga with a little boost would have really set Pasadena off."
2,Pasadena,I did not like this book. I lived near Pasadena and currently live near Carlsbad and was very interested in the history of the two cities where the story takes place. The only reason I finished reading the badly written convoluted story was that it did provide some interesting historical background of the two cities. But any substance was lost in the painfully constructed cast of characters and storyline.
3,For You International Jazz/Soul Lovers,"A friend of mind (hey Kim!!) put me on to this CD when I was showing her my collection. At first listen, I didn't think much of it, but when I got home I couldn't get the songs by Maxwell (One of his best songs) and Crystal Waters out of my head. Other artist featured on this CD is Sting, George Micheal, Omar, Incognito and many more. This Cd is something to lay back and relax to. A CD for long drives through the country. I still haven't connected to some of the songs , but it was away for me to hear a Maxwell track only released on this CD.oNe"
2,Maxwell Fan,"I only purchased this album because it has a very beautiful song on it by the artist known as ""Maxwell""."
4,Wonderful to Read Aloud,"This marvelous story of how tiny and ancient Grandmothe Spider successfully brings the sun, something larger and more spritely animals before her could not accomplish, was written to be read aloud. Instead of the usual stereotypical ""ancient legend storyelling"" literary style we often see with retelling of traditional tales, this legend is refreshingly written in a colloquial manner. This style, as well as the two-page layout with text on one side, makes this an excellent book to read aloud. The textures and colors and expressive animal illustrations can be shown to their best advantage. My boys love all the animal pictures, the humor, and the exciting fire-spouting Sun Guard monsters! We return again and again to see and hear the sweet-faced but proud and determined Grandma Spider as she demonstrates why she is so respected and revered."
1,But it is NOT Cherokee,"This could have been a good book except for the fact that the author claimed it is Cherokee. Cherokee stories do not have coyote as a character. The author should perhaps stick to Navajo stories from her own heritage, or relate stories from other cultures more accurately."
2,"chaotic content, disappointing read","I was looking for a book on art therapy and families; unfortunately, this was not it. The author says she has a lot of years experience with this population, but the message of this book is unclear. Some cases, some diagnostics, some cute techniques. However, there was really no meat here and the content was so chaotic it was hard to follow. Perhaps with some editing it could have been better.The book is also overpriced for what you are getting.Try the following books from my suggested list: Riley/Integrative Approaches to Family Art Therapy Riley/Group Process made Visible Malchiodi/Art Therapy Sourcebook Any books by Eliana Gil, Family Play Therapy recommended/"
3,Myst for Toddlers,"I purchased this game on the recommendation of a children's magazine. I read the reviews here as well, and dismissed the negative ones, largely because the complaints were that the children couldn't do them by themselves (I presumed the authors were the sort of parent who let computers, TV, etc do the babysitting - my apologies). Well, I sat down with my son to play the game and thought it was over his head. To solve the first puzzle, your child would have to go back through one screen to find a key, then to another screen to unlock a shed, then search the shed for the object and finally return to the original screen to use the object. Don't get me wrong - I think it's a great idea to get kids looking for the less obvious answers, but this game is just not for 3 to 4 year olds (the age range the magazine recomended it for). Try it out on a bright 5 year old."
4,hot handler,Most potholders really don't protect your hand from a really hot pot. This one does up to 450 degrees. Buy 2...they only come 1 to a package.
4,deep thought,"if it were up to me, i'd give this redneck riveairist the breadth of expansion to grow to the outer corners of his spectrum. there's room here kids, let's let him expore it...jb"
4,Soft & Sweet,Sweet lullabies that are hauntingly reminiscent of Sarah McLachlan. His warm harmonies are lovely and nicely accented by the instrumental arrangement.
5,Just lovely,"This album was my introduction to Iron & Wine, and I bought it on a whim. I was hooked from the first rythmic taps of of the opening strains of ""Woman King"". I haven't been able to take it out of my cd player since I bought it, and my only complaint about it is that it isn't longer. Worth every cent, despite its brevity."
4,A little slow starting but enjoyable.,"This is the sequel to the incredibly wonderful ""the raiders bride"" and will be much more meaningful to someone who read that book first. In fact this book hinges on that one a great deal.Lucy d'Autrecourt Blackheath lives in colonial virginia with her mother and stepfather, the notorious raider pendragon. She is doted on (because of earlier tragedies) and is very headstrong and willful and always into mischief. She receives a note from England telling her that her birth father is alive and since there were many secrets surrounding him and his supposed deathshe convinces her family to let her visit england so she can surrepticiously pursue it. And of course she gets into a great deal of trouble. She winds up forced into marriage to the angst ridden earl of valcour who has past tragedies of his own. In our terminology, these are 2 (traumatic stress disorder)individuals who eventually help each other recover from their horrible youth."
3,ugh...,"this game is just ok. but it's sooo hard to beat. i'm tony hawk master, i have beaten all of his games. this is hard. but the game is just... OK..."
2,poor quality,"I do not recommend buying these Stikfas. They are cool to look at, and are absolute eye candy for my kids. After having bought or been given several, almost all have broken during the assembly process. If you want a cool little figure to put on your desk, then by all means buy it and put it together *carefully*. If you are looking for a toy for a kid that will actually use them, avoid these or face certain disappointment.I'm disappointed, both because my son is very disappointed and because they are wonderful looking little toys that did not meet expectations. Too bad."
1,Can't rate it yet,"Why, I purchased 1 month ago and still have not recieved it. I have been givin 3 different delevery dates. Funny that after I changed my shipping to ONE day they added 2 days to the delivery date. Needless to say this is the LAST item I ever buy from here."
4,Nada Surf's new direction.,"I suppose these guys are damned if they do, and damned if they don't. Some folks will never forgive them for ""Popular"", others will never forgive them for abandoning that style.The truth of the matter is, this is a nice departure, and a nice new direction for Nada Surf. The songs are melodic, sometimes moody, and the slower numbers work better than the rockers. The production sometimes reminds me of a better rehearsed version of Big Star's ""3rd/Sister Lovers"". Though the lyrics are indeed a bit gloppy at times and could have used a few re-writes (but hey, so could all of Paul McCartney's last album's lyrics, too!), the inventive instrumentation and arrangements makes up for any lyrical shortcomings.My first impressions made me want to keep listening to this album, which doesn't often happen with today's music. Good for Nada Surf for sticking together despite public perception and indifference, and coming up with something new and fresh. They're on the right track."
2,very slow and lethargic/their other 2 albums are much better,"Like I said above, this album has a lot of slow ballads and the whole album seems to lack energy. The ballads lack any memorable hooks and the only good song that I really liked on it was ""treading water""(which is quite a good song). hi-speed soul is halfway decent but thats about it as far as this album is concerned. High/low and the proximity effect are much better choices than this one. nada surf seems to sound somewhat different with every release. They decided to slow it down alot with this one, but it just comes off as boring. In order to play a good ballad there has to be melody and emotion which isnt here. I miss their sound from the high/low (love that song""the plan"") days and wish they would go back to it. anyways maybe they should come back to america and start playing louder, just my opinion"
1,The Lusitania is so much more worthy of attention than this overrated Titanic vessel,"The Lusitania being bombed by a German U-Boat brought the US into WW1. The Titanic sinking brought no country into anything. (A book called ""Did these stories really happen"" showed this of the Lusitania's far, far greater importance.)"
4,Great Show !!,"I love this DVD!! It made me smile as soon as I put it on. The backing band here is great. They rock through the Zeppelin catolog with great skill. Jimmy Page is playing the custard out of his guitar as usual, and Robert Plant has no problem matching his prowess on vocals. A VERY GOOD DEAL!"
2,A Little Amateurish,"I bought this book because a friend ordered it. I found it to be amateurish. There is no table of contents and there doesn't seem to be any format. It reminds me of a book my aunt once self-published to hand out to the ladies at church. There are a few good poems, but it's not worth the price."
3,"Neat nylon-string guitar, standard jazz ensembleims.","Im not a big jazz fan, but I bought this because I am an acoustic guitar fingerstylist and was attracted by the concept of Scofield playing nylon-string guitar. Its a great album, if you like jazz & Scofield, you should get it.If your luke warm on jazz genre' in general, its not a priority."
2,Pinnochio,It wasn' the Pinnochio I wanted. The Disney was sold out. I tried to change my choice but couldn't.It doesn't compare to the Disney version. Quite weak. I don't recommend it.
4,My visit to venus,"I have read that this book even thou was written by Lobsang Rampa was not published by his consent.I understand it was part of the book cave or wisdom of the ancients.Typical lobsang work,unbeleavable but plausable.As a race we know little.I believe there is more to life,and this book could possibly be a peak into reality however how unreal it all seems.There isnt much content, but the manuscript and pictures more than make up for this.Food for thought.A good read."
1,"Stay away, Joe!","Don't waste your money. The ad for this junk is mis-leading. It is advertised as THE SLEEPING CARDINAL, which is the original British title. However, this one is titled SHERLOCK HOLMES' FATAL HOUR, the American release title. Further, the picture quality is VERY poor. It falls into the category older 16 MM film collectors used to call ""basement dupe"". Picture quality is fuzzy and contrasty, with poor sound. I already have FATAL HOUR but thought it would be nice to have the original title. Not so fast, Sherlock! I was hood-winked, as you will be if you ignore my warning. To compound matters, my copy of FATAL HOUR has excellent picture and sound. It is a Synergy product,"
1,HATE HATE HATE this printer,"We have this printer at my office, actually the 4500DS but it looks exactly the same as this. Not sure what the differences may be. I HATE THIS PRINTER. No matter what I do, how many times I program every single aspect of it, what settings I choose when I send a job to print, it just does whatever it wants. I want it to print on the letterhead in tray one, it prints on the legal in tray three. I finally take the legal out of tray three and it won't print anything at all. So I put letterhead in tray three, and hope it prints out of tray one or three. But now it prints on the plain paper in tray two. I've called IT up to look at it and they can't figure it out either. I waste so much time and paper with this stupid horrible machine. This printer is like the nightmare fax machine on Office Space. Don't waste your money; buy anything else."
5,Knock Sock'em Poems,"Tough, acerbic, witty, tender. This is one of those books that doesn't get the marketing, isn't hyped by big shot poets in PoBiz land, but deserves all the praise and more that ""best-selling"" poetry gets. Who is this person, Semansky? I'd like to meet him."
4,Pretty Good,"I found this to be an easy to use book for the beginning astrologer. Great for doing natal charts and learning the basics. I think that most people will want to advance further, hence the title is a bit inaccurate... But, in general, a useful book..."
3,"The statement ""the only book you'll ever need"" is..an overstatement.",The book is largely incomplete for a single source. The enclosed coarse graphs and the CD doesn't allow creation of a natal chart of someone born outside of the USA. A lot of repetitive statements under one topic (such as Sun in a particular sing) . It's written for a very beginner.
5,PERFECT!,This necklace is just gorgeous and has been getting soo many great compliments. I would definitely order another one for my bestie and recommend this product.
4,Trance in it's original and purest form!,"Awhile back I bought a 2-cd set called ""Logic Trance 2"" and immeditately thought it was one of best (if not the best compilation) cd I ever heard. I always wondered if a ""Logic Trance 1"" existed somewhere as it was impossible to find in the US. Fortunately cd shops are now importing this cd from Germany so it should be quite accessable by now. The only reason I give ""Logic Trance 1"" 4 stars and not 5 is because although it is excellent, ""Logic Trance 2"" is still by far the best in this series. My favorite tracks on this 2-cd set are The Beloved ""The Sun Rising (deeply satisfying mix)"" and Resistance D. ""Cosmic Love"". Tracks like these completely define the slyle and sound of early trance which most artist seem to have steered away from now. It also seems to be a bit heavier and more dancable than it's follow up ""Logic Trance 2"", although not quite as diverse. Nevertheless, I highley reccomend it and for a 2-cd set import album you really can't beat the price!"
5,Ozric Tentacles - 'Erpland' (Original Masters),"Good,outstanding and solid 1990 classic release from these neo-progressive space rockers. Known to us common folks as Ozric Tentacles. I've heard several long time Ozric fan(s) mention that 'Erpland' is one of the best pieces of work they've ever put out. I sort of tend to agree with that. Tunes here that's almost sure to pull your senses RIGHT in are the awesome opener ""Eternal Wheel""(believe they still play this song on tour, even to this day), ""Sunscape"", title track ""Erpland"" and ""Valley Of A Thousand Thoughts"". I realize there are SO many Ozric CD titles to choose from. If you happen to be a new/er fan, 'Erpland' would be a nice place to start,then work your way from there. Recommended."
5,An early sound,"At first I felt this album was disappointingly light on the warm, thick grooves found on some later releases. Very little seemed to jump to the foreground. Sticking with it nevertheless, listening to the work repeatedly, I soon discovered a very satisfying dynamic and tribal meatiness in these tracks. Amongst the late-1980s weave of instrumental threads, the biggest surprises come perhaps in the more reserved cuts, trading funky groove pockets for exquisite satin robes flowing in a magical breeze or floating tetrahedrons tumbling across crystalline horizons."
5,Hot Hats,Great Hats for the grade school play we are making costumes for. These now have grey mouse ears on top of them.
4,Waffle Iron,I find it cooks slower than I thought; therefore I like the buzzer alert when waffles are ready..
3,Good waffles while it worked,"This thing whipped out good quality waffles so fast it was amazing.Unfortunately, after about 20 uses, it just stopped working. I opened the thing up and couldn't find the problem (I'm an electrical engineer). After reading another review with the same problem, I don't plan on buying another one. Too bad, because it was a great waffle maker. I just hope my next waffle maker is as fast as this one."
1,good waffles only when everything goes right,"I'm searching for a replacement wafflemaker now since the Wafflepro I purchased a couple years ago just stopped working, probably due to something on the circuit board, since it's not heating up and no lights come on when it's plugged in, while there's no burnt wires on looking inside it.My wife made some good-tasting waffles while it was working but she had to do them crisp or they'd stick to the metal which led to a difficult cleaning job. If we hit upon a good setting, cleanup was very easy.The audible beep when the waffle was done after about 90 seconds was the best feature; it would have also been nice if it made more than one waffle at a time, so some member of our family wasn't waiting for it to finish to continue eating breakfast."
4,Another good mystery novel.,Ed McBain readers will enjoy this novel. It may be 'typical' in action but has enough variety and mystery to keep you reading to the last word.
2,Not up to McBain's usual standard,"Others have written their reviews on the plot, and to that end I suppose it was okay. But in WIDOWS, McBain tries his hand at psychology and demonstrates clearly that he's ill equipped to do so. I'm an avid Ed McBain fan, and I've read the majority of his 87th Precinct series. His work is excellent in the genre of hardcase noir writing. I've spent a lot of hours immersed in his novels and consider him among the 'greats' in police procedural stories. But I think he missed the mark here, causing me to recoil out of the story too many times. Fortunately, this is the only book of his that has done that so far, and I remain solidly a fan! In spite of my negative opinions of this particular book, I would suggest still that people buy it and assess it themselves. McBain books are definitely worthy of collecting by those who enjoy police procedural mysteries."
1,Thoroughly repulsive,"Wasn't it nice of the Native Americans to ""adopt"" Ms. Wolfe? I'm sure they regret it.As long as I live, I will never forget the passage about how she reduced herself to tears trying to convince ""her Native American family"" that, since ""nine million"" of ""her people"" were killed during the ""Burning Times,"" European pagans have suffered just as much as Native Americans. ""I could not make them understand,"" she concluded, perhaps pausing to shed a tear for the ignorant savages.Nowhere in the text did I see word one about some of the profits from this tome going back to the people who shared so generously with Ms. Wolfe and taught her so much. She seems to be a cultural pirate as well as a ""religion-hopper"" who's a Witch one minute, a Shaman the next, and authoress of her own full-blown Wiccan tradition the third.Pass this one by!"
4,The descriptions of the individual pieces of music can often be improved,"This guide to select pieces of 'Chamber Music' contains chapters on the work of Haydn, Boccherini, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Robert Schuman, Brahms, Smetana, Dvorak, Bloch, Bartok,It has a section with chapters on American Chamber Music, English Chamber Music, French Chamber Music, Modern German Chamber Music, Russian Chamber Music.While many of the descriptions of the pieces are interesting I admit that they were often too technical for me. Most disappointing however was my hope of reading about a piece I had listened to a performance of the day before, the Mendelssohn Piano Trio. Op. 49. Instead of an exalted description of a work which I found so deeply moving and satisfying I found snide little remarks. This is not the pattern throughout the book but it made me have a certain reservation towards the entire enterprise."
3,"Nice collection, but uninspired","This is a nice, albeit uninspired, gathering of classic Rodgers and Hart. Recommended for those who have not yet collected any other performances of these popular midcentury hits."
1,Hoodia Does Not work whether it's an expensive brand or a cheap brand!,"I've tried so many different brands and kinds of Hoodia, and it's NEVER done anything at all for me! It does not curb my appetite at all, in fact, it's like I never even took a pill at all! So many reviews have said, ""it has to be real authentic hoodia, or it has to be the expensive brand, not the cheap version, or it has to be P57,"" well NONE of it works because I've tried them all.....down to P57, Desert Burn, and now Hoodoba (which was VERY expensive but I thought it would work, so I spent it!) I wish that it did work, but unfortunately it doesn't."
2,Added surprise!,Received product timely. Upon opening product found weevil infestation. Put product in freezer to kill weevils. Returning product would have been a nuisance.
3,Too many broken pieces,"Generally the dog biscuits are great if not such a high percentage would be broken. The point in buying extra large biscuits is the ""extra large"", small pieces miss the reason for buying theme in the first place. There has to be a better way to pack the biscuits better than this."
1,Didn't Work in my DVD Player,"I have tried to load and view this in my DVD player and it simply didn't work. In fact, it wouldn't eject either. I have a newer Blue Ray player but am reluctant to try that fearing it might get stuck and I won't be able to get it out. Very disappointing."
5,Best album ever? Maybe,"In my thousands of CDs covering Rock of all types, classical and jazz this is the one album I keep returning to for the music contained within. All the songs are strong with a wide variety of sound using the wide variety of instruments that Roxy contained. Out of the Blue does contain the best rock violin solo ever (still sends a shiver up my spine as the song progresses) and Prairie Rose is a beautiful country tune filtered through British Rock.Oh and my copy is signed by Phil!"
2,Horrible computer and customer service,"Please read all of these reviews. Notice they are all from people who recently acquired the computer. Thus, the reviews are positive because they haven't given the computer time to break down which it will probably do. I bought this computer 1 year ago and have had to return it 4 times to Toshiba for repairs. Each time the repair has taken over 2 weeks, and the customer service has been awful. Please be very wary of buying this computer, and from Toshiba in general. It randomly shuts down, the LCD malfunctions, and if you check the Toshiba website forums you will see that other customers have had this problem with satellite computers."
2,Not my style,"This book promised to greatly interest me by its subject matter and title. I am both a traveller and an avid reader who will always give a book a ""fair go"" by reading the first 50 pages. If by that stage it hasn't drawn me in then I put it aside. Previously this ""test"" has proved reliable. Unfortunately I found this book was not easy to read from the start. Life is too short when there are so many fabulous pieces of literature out there to be discovered."
3,Vintage 80's Ninja,"When I first heard that Dave Bradley was replacing Mike ""Righteous"" Dudikoff as the American ninja for this installment I was skeptical. Blood Hunt is actually the best in the series. The plot centers around some biological weapons shenadigans with some old fashioned Ninja magic thrown in for good measure. Bradley is a talented martial artist, and the plot is actually fairly good. The late Steve James rounds out the cast as his usual bad self, his scene with the 2 for 1 butterfly swords is great. Martial arts fans- see it."
1,Went down the tubes,"American Ninja 3 suffers greatly without Michael Dudikoff and David Bradley just doesn't have the same touch as the hero of the film. The highlight of AM3 is muscle bound Steve James returning from the first two American Ninja movies. I am a fan of the first two, but I was really disgusted with American Ninja 3. American Ninja 4 is only a hair better."
2,Not very good,I liked the first or second of the American Ninja series much better than this one. This one had the stars running around showboating way too much which I found irritating. I'd let this one slip by.
5,Remembering fond songs,"This CD was marvelous! Some of the songs I had forgotten, so it was lovely to hear them again. Gordon Lightfoot has a voice to remember and these songs stay with you for a long time. Extremely enjoyable!"
4,"OK, I like it.....","I've listened to this CD numerous times on headphones ususally when I'm flying. I am immensely drawn to the first few tracks. Somewhere in the middle of the disk, however, I get lost. But those first few track are enough for me. This music is fresh and steaming with tension. The recurring theme only makes it more compelling. My mind can only imagine what is happening in the film. Tangerine Dream is the group that can make new music while all the world, with every gadget money can buy, can only try to copy. Four stars for sure...maybe more."
5,Addicted To Palmer!,"""Riptide"" is Palmer's commcercial breakthrough and with hissexy MTV video classic for the the tough-rocking pop/rock of ""Addicted To Love"" or the Janet Jackson-inspired dance-pop of""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" are enough to rate this album highalone.And even if outside of ""Hyperactive"" this album doesn't have any songs to match the inspired craft of the hits what doesthat matter-this is the SINGLES generation and albums are secondary right?Wrong but even some of the weaker cuts will reveal themselfs as lost treasures-it may just take longer!"
2,Addicted To The 80s?,"Truth be told, Palmer isn't really a rock artist. His pop instincts and lover boy posturing have more in common with Frank Sinatra than Buddy Holly. Nothing wrong with that; if it's your thing. This album contains the hit `Addicted To Love' which was so ubiquitous in it's time that Weird Al parodied it. Like most Palmer albums, however, this one is mostly filler, and annoying filler at that. All but devotees should stick to comps."
2,No Scene-o-rama????,"How can anyone write a book about Hamms beer advertising without including the single most distinctive contribution to beer advertising, ever? Ridiculous waste of my time and money. Two stars because it does have some other interesting info about Hamms strategies."
3,Has its highs & its lows --- 3 1/2 stars,"I wish I wasn't echoing the other reviewers, but unfortunately, I tend to agree with them. I bought this CD with such high expectations, and the album was frankly a disappointment. If it had been any other artists, I would probably give it a higher rating, but Stan Getz & Bill Evans just aren't any other artist.It says something that the artist that stands out most significantly on this album is Elvin Jones, who injects as much energy into the sessions as it is possible to give without overwhelming the other musicians.This is not to say that the CD doesn't have its shining moments. I would point to ""Night & Day"" and ""My Heart Stood Still"" (not the alternate takes), which possess the energy that the other tracks seem to lack.Getz & Evans only did this one album together, so it is hard to say if a second effort would have resulted in ""Getz vs. Evans II."" We will never know. It would have been nice to see a better result than what we have."
4,Don't Swing So Hard!,"Let me start off by saying that I am possibly the hugest trombone-playing Stan Getz fan on earth. Bill Evans is in my top 10 of jazz piano players (Shelley Berg will ever be #1).Having said that, this album came very near to disappointing me. We've all had those nights--and those golf games--where the harder we worked, the harder we ""swung,"" the less satisfying our game was. Stan--ever the most tasteful player--seems to be attempting to outplay himself, and Bill joined the battle. What resulted were some extraordinary jazz licks that any piano or sax player would love to be able to emulate; however, it was not characteristic Stan Getz and Bill Evans.Neither of them could ever--I don't think--do anything badly. It's just when I buy Stan Getz and Bill Evans, I expect to hear a musical rendition of two of the world's greatest painters, each with his own brush, painting beautiful scenes on the same canvas."
2,Complete thermodynamics and Intro Stat Mechanics in single text.,I have given 2 stars when I bought this book but now after few years if I can edit then I will give it 4 stars.The most complete text available in thermodynamics and introductory stat. mechanics. This one book will serve for most of the thermodynamics courses and some intro to statistical mechanics. Explanation are clear and lucidand if $ is not of primary concern then this purchase would be non-regret able.I am happy that I bought it few years ago and since that time I have consulted it for thermodynamics and stat. mechanics many times. Now I do not regret my purchase on the contrary I am happy with it and intend to keep it.
3,jesi's thoughts,"For the first book it was grasping enough for me to read the rest, not that I read them in order or anything. Most of the book was Madison saying poor me, but I loved it when she finally made friends with Fiona. Since in all the other books you see Fiona when she's playing off Chet, Egg, Aimee, Drew, Hart, and everyone else, you finally (or firstly) get to see her interact with Madison, and Madison only."
3,From The Files of Madison Finn - #1: Only The Lonely,"Laura Dower writes a fiction series called From The Files of Madison Finn. This book is the first in the series titled Only the Lonely. It is about a girl named Madison Finn whose world is completely changing!The story takes place at the end of the summer and also in the beginning of 7th grade. Her two best friends are gone at camp. Madison Finn says she's very lonely. Then Madison meets a new girl who lives down the street and everything is about to change, maybe more than she wanted it to! Madison's thoughts, worries and adventures are all in her files on her orange laptop. Read how Madison goes through different stages in her life that she has never experienced yet.This book is wonderful! I have already started the 2nd book, Boy Oh Boy. I liked this book because I could relate to it. Madison is just a normal girl doing normal things. I recommend this book to ages 7-10."
1,The title is misleading!,"As a Spanish teacher, I bought the video to show my students how Carnaval festivals are celebrated in Puerto Rico. How wrong I was! There is a scene of a Carnaval parade that lasts a minute or so and that's all the Carnaval cultural background that you will find. This video was shot in the 1970's, and I don't find it funny at all!! I gave the video to a Puertorican friend. Hope he will enjoy more than I did!"
2,weak transfer,"Includes important missing music from the first sound track album. However, this CD is a victim of poor engineering. The insturmentals are acceptable but the vocal songs are distorted with weak dynamic range. The DVD in stereo is much more enjoyable."
3,Making up for a missed opportunity,"I absolutely loved the music from Moulin Rouge. Baz Luhrmann should have taken a page from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera Soundtrack. Luhrmann should have released all the music from the movie in chronological order and as a double CD. With this CD, he's just trying to make up for a missed opportunity. When you listen to both CDs in tandem there is no cohesiveness. Buy it if you must, but quite frankly it feels like an afterthought."
2,moulin rouge 2,I think the second Moulin Rouge movie soundtrack is really dissapointing it does'nt contain all of the other songs on it as it did in the movie Let's just hope that there will be a final movie soundtrack for moulin rouge the movie.
3,Only for fans....,"This game is a cute distraction for fans of the anime. You'll enjoy travelling through familiar locales and meeting familiar people.If you aren't a fan, or are at best indifferent, you will NOT like this game. There is zero depth. Hand to hand fighting is a good way to get killed, but that's about it. It's all about pelting your opponents from maximum range with ranged attack X and then running away like a little girl- very un-Goku like.I'm a big fan of the show, and I enjoy the game every now and then. It's fun to make Goku scream ""Kamehameha!"" so often your girlfriend begins to scream it randomly too."
4,Why to RENT DragonBallZ The Legacy of Goku!!!,"I think you should rent this game because it is really short when you get the hang of it you really only learn 4 attacks Flying,Solor Flair,Ky Blast, punching,and of coarse Kamehamaha. Then you fight several things at the end of the game you battel Frezia."
5,A very good dragonball z game,"This is a very good game to play, but it didn't follow the storyline good. First he learns solar flare from tien and he learns kamehameha from master rosi when he was a boy. besides that the rest of the game was fun. my opnion is that radiz is the hardest guy in the game and the ginyu squad is the easiest guys in the game. The hardest part for me was finding the artifacts. All dragonball z fans should get this game."
1,Should of been better,This game is fun and all it has all teh characters in it but the story went by wayyyyyyy too fast and the game was only 3 to 4 HOURS LONG. i beat it in 2 days and i take my time on these but its still a fun game its just too short and quick! Also you gain levels as in a RPG but the highest level u can reach is level 25 and u learn 3 moves out of the whole thing Ki Solar Flar Kameah. If i knew it would this short i would of RENTED it.
5,this game rocks,get this game this game has everything you could with for its so cool if i were you id get this game because it has pretty good graphics and outstanding gameplay is everything you could want in a game this game is the bomb !
2,Pretty cool........gues again,the game falls short of a great DBZ game you only get 3 attacks which are not powerful at all and in the beginning it's pretty hard to kill wolves and currently I'm stuck in the namek temple and the guyes in there are almost invincible but the grafics are ok I guess but it's still a bad game rather spend your money on metroid fusion or Tekken advance thats about it it seems they are masking a bad game with a good theme.
2,Ripoff !!!,Well when i first got this game i thought it would be the best game of all time. i was wrong. It has boring gameplay and it is too short!!!! I beat this game in 8 hours!The best thing about this game is its graphics. But the rest is terrible. Ive seen better. Alot Better!!!
4,DBZ on the GBA!!!,As a hardcore DBZ fan (Dubbed and Japanese versions) this is a beauty of a game. It closely follows the first DBZ sagas from The Sayain saga- The Freeza saga. Only true DBZ fans will have what it takes to help Goku relize his legacy.
3,kind of like pokemon,"This game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay like pokemon.You grow levels with points.Wild creaters to battle to get points.If you like kind'a like pokemon and are a big DBZ fan then you should get this game.Its not like the tv episodes with the exeptions of going through temples.First you find Roshis magazines,then find Radditz kick his butt.You get sent into another demension ,train with King Kai.When you go back to Earth you battle Vegeta andNappa.Then go to Namek gob through temples and beat Frieza.Thats basicly the game.I would say its ok but still I chose 3 stars becuse I didn't like it much either.If you really like DBZ then you should wacth the episodes.I loved DBZ and wacthed the episodes."
2,I would not suggest this game to anyone.,"I would not reccommend this game to anyone except for an extreme fanatic of Dragon Ball Z. At first it's kinda cool, considering that there haven't been many Dragon Ball games. Although I played it with my friend before a movie for half an hour, it proved to be a pathetic game.It was simply unentertaining. In the begginning you fight wolves and snakes. The problem is when a wolve spots you, he charges at you, and you can't get the freaken wolf away from you. you can't punch, because you'll die first. You can't run because your too slow.The controls were kind of sloppy. and there was nothing too special about the graphics."
2,Mmmm...,This game is hard and boring. U can fight many enemys and hardly ever lv up. One wolf can kill u in 4 turns and ud need like 10. It gets pretty boring scince u cant hardly do nothin'.Dont buy this game.
3,an OK game........,"this game was eazy, and had cheesy graphics too short and well a never mind. The last boss was hard but kinda eazy, you can't even walk diagonally in the game just right, left, up, and down!i beat this game in 4 days, o YEAH it includes a cool poster.I don't like how thhe makers made this game, they could've puttin alot of more hardwork on it! I suggest you getMegaman Battle Network (1 or 2) and Golden Sun!I waited along time for this game but, it STINKS!don't buy it!"
1,DragonBall Z Legacy Of Goku,This game is too short.I beat it in 4 and a half hours.You only become a supersayan once and your only your speed increases.You don't train in space.Don't get the game +_+
3,Super- bomber,Ok so this game was ok. But it could of been much better.1. There could of been a lot more moves.2. The flying trick was not great.3. It could of fallowed the stroy line a lot more.4. There could of been a lot more levels. like going up till goku dies in the cell saga insted of dying on namek.Thats all but if you are dbz fan feel free to try it out it...
2,I find some of the most bring games better than this...,"It's really an OKAY game. I'd actually find fun in killing the animals in the game, but they usually keep killing me. I've already died like, 5 times without even getting to Raditz yet. Keep your money peoplz... you'll prolly need it on a better game, such as Pokemon Advance. It's not really worth getting. HP is low, flying can't be used a lot, attacks are weak, the enemies are usually way stronger than you easily getting you killed... and you don't know when they will attack. I found a better DBZ game that I downloaded which is almost like this, but MUCH BETTER. The only good things about this is the clips from the show and movies... and it's challenging, though I find Pokemon more challenging and stratigic than this."
3,"Good game, Dissapointing though","Ah, Dragonball z finnally has an english game title. Dragonball z the Legacy of Goku is an effen sweet game with awsome graphics and a sweet story line. BUT this game is a little on the short side. It took me 2 1/2 hours to beat ENTIRLEY. that includes getting to max exp. level 25 and completing every quest. Talk about a downer. The combat in this game takes a while to get used to but until you get a knack for it this game is a little unfair when it comes to battle. If you wanna spend [money] dollars on this game im not stopping you. But i would reccomend renting it."
1,not a good game at all !!!!!!!!!!!,"this game is terrible. not only can you beat it in one hour{if you can find the artifacs], but this game gets extermly anoying when you can't find the 3rd artifact. It also has a bad combat, like in the show dragon ball z is known for it's fighting and combat, but in the game the comat is so bad that I should give this game a 0 out of 5. I hope that the gameboy game is better. So take it from me if you are hoping for some great fighting and fun game play, you are looking at one of the worst games of all time. Don't get it !!!"
1,SHORT,"This game is too short, I beat it in 2 hours. These kind of games should be a lot longer. Warning: WASTE OF MONEY!!!..."
1,Buyers beware,"I purchased the Blitzz Netwave Base II and 2 Blitz PCI wireless cards to hook up a wireless network between 3 systems. The base would be used on my Pentium 4 2.0 Gig on the second floor of my home. The other 2 PC's are located on the 3rd floor (about 50 feet from the base). I cannot get a sufficient connection at that distance. I called Tech support and was told that the 3 systems must be within 25 feet of each other for proper connection. Unless your PC's are in the next room on the same floor, I would not buy this product. All this aside....the install was easy and setup was easy. I'm returning mine and going to a wired network."
1,"Don't bother, unless you're married to Bill Gates","I bought this under the impression that it worked with Linux and the Mac. Though it didn't say so on the box, a friend had one and the drivers for Linux, Mac, and Windows were on the disk. I worked on setting it up in Linux for 4 days to no avail. When I tried to set it up on my roommate's G4 Powerbook I had many of the same problems as before. After 2 calls to IBlitzz, dealing with people who hadn't a clue, I was told that my issue was given Level 2 status and that someone would contact me the next day. Today I got an email saying that the BWU613B is not supported on the Mac."
1,Not a merry Christmas book,Rather morbid for Christmas with a bit of a sick sense of humor. The best part about the book was how short it was.
1,Horrifying,"Although I have enjoyed Mr. Sedaris's sarcastic humor in the past and found his occasional murky perspective both truthful and poignant, this book was simply too horrific to continue reading. There is nothing entertaining or profound about the murder of an infant. Needless to say I was disapointed in this book. I can only speculate that those who find any entertainment value in a story describing the torment and torture of a baby the very reason our society is rapidly sinking into a state of depravity from which we can never recover. How I long for more of Erma Bombeck's sense of humor."
1,Not well written or interesting compared to his other work,"This book simply has no satirical value. Once you get beyond the first chapter, it continues downhill. I read ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" and just assumed the writing in this book would be just as good or at least interesting but the author was incapable of mixing funny into any part of the book. Not worth reading."
2,"A little too bitter, even for me.","Too bitter and jaded, even for me. The first story, The Santaland Diaries about his time as an elf at Macy's in New York, resonated with 12 years of holiday retail experience. It was also funny. The other stories were just... ugly. Not funny, not entertaining."
2,Really disappointing,"This was my first exposure to David Sedaris, and I hope it'll be my last. For starters, there's his voice--a grating, oddly inflected whine that frequently made me want to eject the tape. As for the material, some of it is amusing, but many of the stories cross the line between sharp satire and sick, unfunny (and often boring!) discourse. Maybe there are better works by this author, but this one is really terrible."
1,save your money,"Sedaris writes in the same style as Nick Hornby but his stories aren't nearly as humorous or interesting. I found 'Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!' to be particularly annoying and disturbing. I was going to give this book as a Christmas present, but after reading it, I threw it in the garbage."
3,Good service,"CD is OK for Sedaris - I've heard better- package was a little crushed but that was a small factor. Otherwise, happy with item and service."
2,Not his best work,The first story was good...classic Sedaris...several of the others were boring and to me a bit silly and over the top. Obviously this was written before he got his grove on as a humorist story tell.
2,Not His Best Work,"Immediately before reading this I had read ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" and loved it so much I thought I'd pick this up. It just happened to be the holidays so this seemed a natural choice. I was very disappointed.Four of the six entries here are fictional which halps make his biographical essays that much more believeable. The ""Santaland Diaries"" is decent. There are funny parts but the diary aspect of it makes it choppy and I have found his humor best when he controls the flow of the story rather than cutting together some events.The other biographical essay here is ""Dinah, The Christmas Whore"" which I found the best essay here but is what I would call the literary version of a b-side.By the end I found that I was enjoying the entries so little I was skipping large chunks hoping to get to a good part.After my first book from David Sedaris I was eagerly looking forward to another one. After this I'm not so sure."
1,Maybe the book is better?,"David Sedaris, author of Me Talk Pretty One Day, is normally one of my favorite authors. His essays and short stories are usually humorous and enjoyable. However, Holidays on Ice proved to be the exception. This was an audio edition of four of Sedaris' essays/stories about Christmas. While the first story about a department store elf was marginally funny, the rest were horrendous. Sedaris' normally charming narration was grating and whiney and while I did listen to the very end, I honestly wish I hadn't. Perhaps this one would be better if read, rather than listened to, but I think not. I'm not a fan of the Christmas holidays and, seemingly, neither is Sedaris, but his stories didn't prove amusing - they were just annoying."
2,Holiday on Ice,This book had a great start and just like the holidays it all went downhill from there. Better books by Sedaris abound.
4,Love him!,David Sedaris always delivers a great story. I giggled all the way through this book. Can't wait to read another!
3,Fast reading,This is a fun book to read around the holidays as it shares a variety of stories containing a lack of cheer concerning the season.
3,Not his best,"Luckily I have read other Sedaris books before, so I know what he is capable of. The first story was funny, the rest, not so much. The story of the family in competition with their neighbors, which was supposed to be a satire on our one-upping our neighbors, was so over-the-top to not even be entertaining and certainly not funny."
5,"Awesome read, awesome Christmas gift","Santaland Diaries is the showpiece of the great collection of holiday essays. Have given this as an (adult - one story is Dinah the Christmas Whore) gift many, many times. Love it!"
3,Very uneven work from David Sedaris,"Another collection of essays from humorist David Sedaris, Holidays on Ice is not his best work. The stories, all dealing with the holiday season, are hit or miss, making for a very uneven book.Far and away, the funniest, most irreverent essay included here is ""SantaLand Diaries,"" wherein Sedaris recounts his days working as a Macy's elf -- at the age of 33. This story alone makes Holidays readable, but if you're looking to begin reading David Sedaris, pass on this book and pick up Me Talk Pretty One Day instead."
3,Not what I expected,"This was my first time reading a David Sedaris book cover-to-cover. I've read a few of his other stories and excerpts based on recommendations. I chose this book for my book club and am not sure how the group will respond to it. I found it cynical and disillusioned, as expected. Unfortunately, for the most part, these tones were not accompanied by the humor I was expecting. I will definitely try some of his other books, but overall, was let down with this particular collection."
4,Sedaris,I really liked the Macy's Elf portion of the narrative but the remaining tracks left something to be desired.
2,Not what was expected,"I read Sedaris' ""Dress Your Kids in Curduroy and Denim"" *I think I got the title right) and found it hilarious. So when I saw this by the same author in the bookstore, I bought it. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.The first story, ""SantaLand Diaries"" is hilarious, though. The best story in the book. I probably liked it so much because it was based on his life, (at least I think so), while the other stoies were unclear and coming from another person's point of view. I guess I like Sedaris' writing because he turns his own experiences that seem so ordinary and well, sometimes odd experiences, into such hilarious stories. So when I read this, I was expecting to read another compilation of funny stories like those he wrote about in ""Dress Your ..."" But I guess not. If you want to read the ""SantaLand Diaries,"" I suggest you buy the other book that has it nd not spend the money for four other stories that aren't his best."
3,A couple of bright stars,"""SantaLand Diaries"" and ""Dinah, the Christmas Whore"" save this one. Sedaris is at his best telling tales (tall or otherwise) of his own life and family. I like the satirical stories less. Still, it is David Sedaris after all... which means you'll no doubt laugh and enjoy yourself."
4,Twisted,"David Sedaris gives us a book on Christmas with a twist. This is not a book about how wonderfull Christmas is but how sick and screwed up the world is with Christmas as the backdrop. My personal favorite story is about working as an Elf with Santa at a department store for the holidays. The little vignettes within the story about the going ons in the Santa department is truly funny because it is true. I worked at a famous toy chain one year and the same stories happened to me. Not one of the stories is traditional, but written with a New York sense of humor. ""Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol"" is about a serious review of children's Cristmas pagents and is every bit as blistering as if they were a Broadway play. ""Christmas Means Giving"" is about one-up-man-ship of trying to keep up with the Joneses and is every bit as funny as it is sick. If you want a book with a warped sense of Christmas that is funny, this is for you. This is definitly not for children, but it is for their parents."
3,Redundant...,"Recounts what has already been said in the three other books, although it makes a great 10 dollar gift. If you have the others, dont bother. J."
2,Not his best work,"The stories are disjointed and pointless. I have read Sedaris' work before and couldn't stop laughing, I didn't even chuckle reading this book, was a waste of money."
3,Okay Game by the J-Man,"This game is okay. I mean, for serious players it's easy, but for people who've only played a game or two, it's difficult. You have to press down in the direction you want to swing at with your lightsaber, which can get very annoying when in combat with a boss. Also, you cannot choose who you wish to be. And when that guy who did another review said you see clips from the movie, what he MEANT was you see pictures from the movie and words at the bottom telling you what's going on. You also have to get power-ups to get the force. Some parts of this game are quite tedious. Rent it. If you like it, buy it. I kind of regret buying it, but mine had technical problems with the graphics. Other than that, it's a cool game."
2,Yuck...,"Man, this game is sad. Graphics are palatable, but the controls kill what should be an otherwise awesome game. For example, the controls during lightsaber battles are so complex that you are required to stand still while dishing out your justice ..."
4,Okay,this game is okay because its fun when u get it bu after awile it gets boring.Graphics: 4/5Gameplay: 2/5 (gets boring quickly)Sound: 0/5 (sucks like all games)Overall: 4/10
2,Very frustrating,"Now there have been some bad Star Wars games, and this is one of them. When I first saw screenshots of this I thought it would be a great platform game like the original Super Star Wars for the Super NES. Boy was I wrong. The controls are unresponsive, and while the characters are nicely designed, the background levels aren't designed very good. The John Williams score is grating on the GBA's tiny speakers, and all that combined means that you will die, a lot. And when you die, no matter how far you get in the level when you die, you start over right from the beginning. All in all, I think Star Wars fans should use the force, and skip this one."
3,I was slightly dissapointed in it.,"I ordered the CD for the song that played over and over during the trailers that ran on tv all the time. I thought the name of the song was *crush*, and there was a song listed on the information sheet with that name on it. Don't get me wrong, the Cd is OK, but I didn't even see the movie, and wasn't interested in the other music from it. Anyway, if you are looking for that song too, it's not there."
3,Not the love is blue I remember!,"Not the love is blue I remember! I remember this song when it was popular and released as a 45 rpm. single and this is not it. How do I know? I still have that single I got in the seventies. Although I believe the song to be originally from the late sixties this is not the single widely released that I like so much , it sounds less sincere and more Vegas show tune in this take. That's just my opinion, some may like this version but if you're looking for the one that had the wide release on a single then stay away from this one.UPDATE!!!I DID FIND THE ORIGINAL LOVE IS BLUE ON BILLBOARD TOP POP HITS 1968. I GOT THIS CD FROM AMAZON AFTER A SURCH AND IT'S THE ORIGINAL. CHECK IT OUT!"
4,Great submarine book!,"Two Hours to Darkness is one of the greatest submarine books ever written! Thrilling, exciting and brilliant. Reading it is like patrolling 1000 feet beneath waves."
2,Nothing Grabbed Me!,"I have another cookbook by this author - ""The Black Family Reunion Cookbook"" - that has been worn down from frequent use, so I thought this would be another great book. This book provides a lot of history on ingredients and food, but the recipes themselves did not interest me. Maybe I was just expecting a whole lot more given the author and my experience with her other book, but I was not at all impressed by this book."
4,Great kit for the money,"Like first reviewer said, you will not find this at your local Home Depot or Lowe's. Plus I was suprised at how low the price was after looking at parts seperately. I would have rated it five stars if the escutcheon flanges were better, they do not have a screw or anything to attach to the escutcheon. I will have to somehow attach them with glue or something. Overall great buy though."
2,One of the Most Boring Books in history!,"This book is extremely boring! There is far too much detail about every little thing that occured in the book. Dr. Kemp, who is a strict man of Science is nothing bu something that makes the book boring. I truly do not like science at all. It is kind of depressing to me, but not to everyone. But, the novel deals with Griffin coming into Iping in some freak costume. I have never read another book that was as hard as this one, or even more so, BORING! Who wants to read a book about Science and all of the minor little details that deal with such and such? I am disappointed!"
3,Wow!,"I've never read the original book before, only seen the old fashioned film. So different! The writing of H. G. Wells does not seem to have the quality I remember from other books. Having said that I did enjoy it."
5,Bamboo duo,"This is a jazzy shakuhachi duo (shakuhachi is the traditional Japanese bamboo flute.) If you like the sound of the shakuhachi, but want something fresh-sounding, this is your CD.The duo of Hidekazu Katoh and Richard Stagg takes the shakuhachi to a new plain of merged jazz improvisation with Japanese sensibility. The fun parts are where the two independent flutes suddenly come together in unison, then drift apart again, always in harmony. It's uncanny. Very interesting CD and highly recommended for anyone who likes flute."
1,It is not what they announce.,I had this lotion on the packaging showing the ad and definitely not sent me what they show in the picture is far from the scent of the lotion. I am so unhappy with what he sent me I decided to dump it.
3,"Gets the job done, barely","I've used a similar product by Panasonic which was MUCH better made, but I haven't found the Panasonic brand adapters sold outside of a Costco rechargeable battery kit.The 4 Lenmar AA-to-D adapters do work but they are inconsistent in how well your AA batteries fit inside. 2 of the 4 adapters worked normally for me while the other 2 were too loose or the AA battery didn't snap into place when inserted - and I tried several AA batteries with the same results.These Lenmar's are cheaply made but they will work. I don't recommend putting these adapters into service where you're going to have to change-out batteries all the time."
4,Bought these to use with Eneloop batteries,I bought these to use with my eneloop AA batteries. They do the job. It just sucks that shipping is more expensive than the actual items!! lol.
5,All Arnold fans must have this.,"To start, its made by THQ (#1 gaming company). I bought the Gameboy Advance for the sole purpose of getting this game, believe it or not. This game is extremely fun. And it follows the storylines of the movie. I highly recommend it. Not one to miss. :-)"
5,perfect condition,"This game is pretty hard, but the service was excellent. Fast shipping and the product was in mint condition."
4,"Cute, but...","If you want a good inspiration for making your place ultra swanky, I agree with the other reviewer that ""Pad"" is the way to go. But this book is really cute and not too outrageous, has some good ideas and a great layout. It makes a good housewarming gifty for single gal friends. Some of the advice is annoying and just makes you go ""duh. I knew that"". Like the advice for ""Get real paint out of your hair"" (mentioned above) it is basically a one paragraph inset about shampooing out latex paint. Now, how to remove oil based varnish from a platinum blonde dye job would have been really helpful, but this is pretty basic stuff. Its still a fun read."
2,Not as inspirational as their other books,I have owned and read other books by these authors and come from an interior design background. I feel there are other books out there - such as Christopher Lowell's books that are much more inspirational as far as decorating goes. I think these Ladies best stick with what they do best - Party Planning....
1,Ridiculous,"I would not even give this one star, but that's the minimum...This is obviously a book for teenagers judging by it's content, but I don't know of any teenagers that have their own apartments....maybe a dorm room at college....what a waste of time in terms of real decorating ideas or inspiration. I'm sorry for the trees that gave up their lives to the paper used in printing this book!"
1,SUPER!,"I NEVER READ THIS WHOLE BOOK CAUSE IT WAS SOO BAD! DO NOT BUY IT, PLEEAASSEE DON'T, IT'S JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!"
3,Your Wedding Reception Video Is Better... Trust Me,"My godson and his brother partied to this DVD for about a week then grew tired with the corny music and hum-drum routines. Some of the dance moves are mature and suggestive but most children will have no idea about the steps they'll just innocently follow along. I'm not certain whether or not this is a good thing. If I'd had the opportunity to preview this DVD I definitely would not have purchased it however, since I did buy it I can say that it was worth the money for the few days of rest it afforded my friend and her husband. The more I think about it they might have simply played the video of their wedding reception for free and gotten a better response from the boys."
5,excellent beginner hip hop video for the young an young at heart,"At first I was not sure if I liked this video but after watching all of it,it is perfect for the beginner and to learn different moves. He shows a mirror image and another image where you think you are behind him. He is very through. I bought this for my middle school Korean students to get a taste of one of the most popular dances in America today and also to let them know there is more than one way to learn English."
5,Superb!,"This is an amazing piece of music by probably the most elegant of all piano players in the history of jazz. Evans always delivers more than one can expect: playing on his own, in duets (with Tonny Bennet, for example) and with his trio with Scott Lafaro and Paul Motian. This was no exception."
4,shifty or sugar ray?,"well I like shifty and he is a talented guy, but it seems as if marriage has made him loose his edge. For whatever reasons he dropped the rock/rap and went to pop, well f... it the cd has good dance songs but I still wish he was a bit more""hardcore"""
1,Pure Boring,When i played the legacy of Goku i thought no game in the world could be worse than it. Butt when i played this game i found myself wrong. The music is baaaaad. The most boring music ever!! It is a very cheap and boring game. Plus it is confusing. At the begining i didnt know what the heck i was doing. Caution this game sucksss!
2,Don't buy,"I gave this game a star for every second it's fun. This game has so many errors in it. First off all the text phrases, ""if successful,"" and ""if you declared a tokui-waza,"" are completely ignored. Secondly, the game was not upto date with the CRD at the time the game was made, so you can put in all the cheap cards you want and make an nearly unbeatable deck, making the game incredibly easy. Thirdly, all cards form all sagas are not included, so you have 1/3 the cards that you should. Also, the whole layout for this game is hard to follow. If you plan on purchasing the Legacy of Goku, instead don't. I beat the game in just over 2 hours, it's a real disappointment."
4,Power Adaptor,"Very small and convenient. I especially like the USB connection. When we travel, I won't have to bring 5 chargers!"
3,DORA DOLL REVIEW,"We bought this doll for our 12 month old for her first birthday, and she likes it - it makes her laugh. She loves the show, Dora, so we wanted to get her a little Dora doll to play with. The only complaint I have is that her hair became very messy right away. It is hard to get it back to her original condition. Still, for the $, this was a good deal. Overall, we are satisfied."
2,Average White Man,"Robert Palmer is not much of a rock vocalist, but he is certainly not a R & B singer. Several songs showcase a great band, but I have no idea who told this guy he could sing. I wish I could turn him off."
5,Her best and lasting album,"This is the album by which Marianne Faithfull will be remembered -- Broken English is an uncompromising portrait of pain and suffering from someone who has experienced more than her share. This album is electrifying, brave, and unlike anything before or since. Highly recommended."
3,Interesting,"An interesting read but Mr. Deedat has proven nothing that has not already been said. Nothing will convince me that Muhamad is a true prophet or that the Koran is the final word of God..One needs only to look at the its contradictions and see the writings of that era. If we cant believe in the story of the Crucifiction, we cant believe in the fiction of the Koran."
4,Statistics 7th Ed. by Witte - worth spending some time on!,"To begin with, I saved 30 bucks purchasing this bok used from amazon.com, compared to what I would have paid at my school. Great! Fast delivery too.Second, this is a stats book, a subject that might not be very exciting for many of us. But this book is great! Easy to under stand, just read it carefully and follow the instructions for how to calculate the formulas, and you will have no problems with your class! Just put some time into it and the A is yours!"
2,only for math majors,This book is hard to understand and follow unless of course you are majoring in mathmatics. Not only I but several other students in the class agreed the book was not helpfull at all. Terms are described with other terms that you absolutely have to know. I only recommend this book for people who are really into the math scene.
5,Used Statistics Book,"This was the first book to arrive out of the 6 other books that I ordered, and I am very happy with the received product. The book looks almost new to me and, to be honest, I didn't expect it to be so small, but that's good news for me because it'll be lighter to carry around :)."
4,very pleased,"This textbook was selected for me to use in teaching statistics to undergraduates. I've just finished reading it and I am, on the whole, very pleased. It is much easier to understand than any of the statistics texts I used in upper division courses or graduate school. It is straight forward and concise yet has a fairly conversational style. The only downside is the need for text corrections (about a page worth) but these are available from the book's companion website and can be handed out the first day of class to avoid student frustration."
5,Never thought I would say this...,"But I do love this show. I so enjoy the interplay of characters. The show is just enough like the original to make it feel as though you are watching old friends, and enough of a story in its own right to be fresh and engaging. I'll be buying Season 2! [By the way, the ultra-good guy Horatio Caine is very sexy! And they say nice guys finish last.... :^)]"
3,A Superior Spinoff,"Fans may argue, but ""CSI: Miami"" remains superior to its Las Vegas counterpart. Surrounded by a fine cast, David Caruso's strong presence makes the difference - it's great to have him back on TV where he belongs. The exotic locations, topical storylines and offbeat characterizations prove that the series is here for the long run. ""CSI: Miami"" does not represent groundbreaking television, yet it delivers the crime-drama goods."
2,Not as good as the original by a long shot,"I really liked the original series and when I finished its first 3 seasons, I was looking for more and decided to try this. A big let-down. The regular characters never get very involving, if one of them got killed in the line of duty who would care? Also, where the original series had some humor and wit, especially as to how the crimes were committed or twists of fate that obscured how they happened, this has very little humor, and wit has been replaced with gross-out or shock appeal. Now its how many family members can all be killed in one episode, what's the youngest victim they can come up with, how gruesomely presented can be murders be, how much torture or mutilation can be shown to spice things up? This is like the National Enquirer version of CSI. Perhaps it is a natural evolution as the writers have to find 2 more new crimes to present each week. They've run out of clever, so they go for shock."
2,Bad way to start!,I love CSI: Miami but this season is a little much. For one thing every time a murder happens it has to go into detail and look at all the gory parts that other seasons don't this season is also kind of boring in script I think Horatio has about the only good lines. There are some episodes that are good but if your going to buy this get the SECOND SEASON it's way better!!!!!
4,Solid Motorcycle Racing,"If you've ever watched Moto GP on TV, then played this game, it's hard to tell the difference. The game is THAT realistic, but this can be a mixed blessing. If you're more into the arcade racing games than this might not be the game for you, but if you love intense motorcycle racing and simulation games, then you'll love this game.I'm not a hardcore racing simulation fan, so that's why I gave the game four stars instead of five, but other than that, this game hasn't skipped a single detail in the Moto GP racing world. Worth a good look at!"
5,My husband loves it!,"I really didn't know whether to give this a 5 or a 1 since my husband loves it so much he plays it several times each week! <<smile>> Fortunately, it's a game I can watch with him (very little violence and no gore)."
5,A must have for Leukemia parents,"I read this book 20 years ago when my son was treated for ALL, it helped both me and him go through those difficult times, it explains the treatment process, and addresses all the thoughts that go over our minds (""why me?"", ""was it my fault?"", ""what are my chances?""). The cartoons are nice for kids and help them understand what is going on. I can not thank enough Dr. Baker for this remarkable book."
1,Rent It First!,"If at all possible, rent this game first. My 5-year-old got frustrated with the lack of action in the game--if there is any, it's not in the first level--all you do is chase down people to ask them questions and search for clues. This game seems like it was thrown together quickly to get something out in time for the movie, with very little thought towards whether or not it would be enjoyable. If you want a good action-oriented Scooby game, get the ""Phantom Virus"" game for Gameboy Advance or ""Night of 100 Frights"" for Playstation 2."
2,Readable but largely disappointing.,"As a great Theroux fan, I approached The Black House with enthusiasm which soon faded. The prose is ponderous and the main characters are dull. An anthropologist returned to England after ten years in Uganda, the haunted Munday (a bad-tempered, stuffed shirt if ever there was one) becomes an incongruous partner in a steaming affair with the apparition, Caroline. Their clandestine meetings are occasioned by Caroline's invasion of the conscious mind of Munday's wife, Emma. She finds herself compelled to send her husband off on irrational errands which culminate in more sexual encounters with a waiting Caroline. (Difficult to swallow? Yes, indeed) The promised horror and haunting don't really make the grade and the most entertaining portion of the book, in my opinion, was the unwelcome visit of the African Silvano to the English village where the Mundays were not regarded kindly. This, at least, was worth an occasional chuckle."
5,Takes me back,"Love this collection of old-timey hymns, and Andy's voice is strong and true. I find myself singing along and have really enjoyed playing this CD in the car."
2,OK,This is not as good as I was expecting it to be. I have quite a few of his CD's and this one is at the bottom of my pile.
5,Thaström's best?,"OK this is good, really good. Thaström was never that much a favourite of mine. I liked Ebba Grön, he had done some good stuff with Imperiet but I was never really convinced by his persona. However his turn to industrial techno stuff with Love Peace and Pitbulls and this record was something quite unexpected. It is very inspired hard industrial rock taht can match the greats in that genre. He went on to make some more sentimental stuff later that I have problems with..."
2,doesn't make the cut,"This recording was number 5 on the best of editors list,sounded interesting, so I took the chance. I expected more of Neko Case and I certainly expected an album that didn't sound like it had been recorded in a metal storage shed. Jeez, the producer and engineer should go back to the garage for some lessons. The melodies are pleasant, but so is a bowlfull of warm jello. The playing is adequate, but not inspired. Perhaps I was expecting too much. Maybe it will grow on me. Don't waste your money, buy Interstate Managers by Fountains of Wayne. Now, that sounds like power pop."
4,Pretty decent,"The graphics for this game is stellar. The music is okay, and the game is a little too short. The game is fun, but it is also too easy. I started playing it and couldn't put it down until I beat the game about 4 hours later. Pretty good buy for a bargain price."
2,"Interesting topic, expert writer, frustrating book","I wish I could give this book three or four stars. Erwin is an expert in the area of the Permian extinction, and when he tries, he can write well. Unfortunately, he does not seem to try often. There are just too many sentences here that need to be read two or three times before their meaning becomes clear. The meaning of many of the graphics never become clear! And at the end of each chapter, I was unclear about what I had learned, and what I could expect next.I finally gave up half way through the book. At that point, I was as confused about the Permian extinction as I was at the beginning, and I cannot even say I was confused at a higher level."
1,Not what I was waiting for.,"The box around the cheese was broken and the other items were spread all over the box. I expected the box to be made out of wood and not jus plain carboard for that price. It was a very importend good-bye gift, but in that state it didn't look like that at all. I was very sad."
5,unclassifiable masterpiece,"This is one of my favorite albums to listen to when I drive or when I work. It's refreshing, smooth and enjoyable. It is calypso music, New Wave style. The album's highlights are: ""Pride"" (title track) is Robert's answer to Olivia Newton John's ""Let's Get Physical""; ""You Are in my System"" has dico and funky undertones; ""What You Waiting For"" is the typical New Wave song with a synth hook and a heavy slap basse; ""Want You More"" is a solemn love song with sweeping synth notes; ""The Silver Gun"" is a song unlike any other. Sung in Urdu (a language from Pakistan), it is a very haunting and bizarre track, which displays the incredible versatility of Robert Palmer's voice. The track's music shows a very complex mix of synth loops, samples, heavy beats, funk basse. The rest of the album has a few weak tracks (""You Can Have It"", ""It's Not Difficult"", ""Dance For Mew""), but you can always remove them from your playlist and enjoy the rest of the album."
4,Great for PnP Character Sheets in sleeves.,"I hand these out, along with plastic sheet sleeves for the players of my pen and paper RPG sessions. It helps keep the constant erasing from ruining the papers and wasting erasers!"
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I bought this hoping for a funny little time killer. It had a few funny moments, but they were few and far between. Not unpleasant to watch, just not great."
3,Enlightening!,"There are many things I find incredible about the telling of this story. The first being Mr. Mitrione's account of seeing the poster of Joan Butler and how it led to the writing of this book. From there the reader gets a horrifying glimpse into the mind of a cold blooded killer, but also gains an appreciation for the dedication of the law enforcement officers who brought him to justice, largely on circumstantial evidence. Most importantly, Mr. Mitrione makes us feel the pain of loss of the families of the missing girls and the agony of never being able to lay them to rest. I know that I will be much more careful after reading this book."
3,Suddenly Confusing,"In the begining of the book, before the story even started it mentioned that several women's lives were ruined by this killer yet only 5 were actually mentioned with one not really being linked to Grissom. So who were the other two? But other than that, it was a good book. It could have delved more deeply into Grissom's childhood. There had to be more to him then just a bad seed. Was he made or born to be a killer? I feel bad for the poor women who had no idea that this predator was lurking in their neighborhood."
1,Appalling,"To say that I am appalled at Mr. Mitrione's writing of this book, more specifically the book's subject matter, is an understatement. Having lived in South Florida during the time of Mitrione's employment as an FBI agent there, I am very familiar with his career and the circumstances which ended that career. It is chilling to contemplate how Mitrione researched this book by gaining information from the honest, hardworking investigators who were able to bring Grissom to justice. Even more disturbing is how Mitrione intruded into the lives and the pain of the victim's families. I agree that this story should have been told to honor the victims-especially the young women whose bodies were not recovered-their families, and the incredible dedication of the law enforcement officers. I am sorry that Mr. Mitrione was the one to tell it, and I am left wondering why he did."
3,Under powered drill for even small jobs,"As the title says this drill is very underpowered. I purchased this drill for doing small jobs around the house such as drilling holes into dry wall, putting together a closet organizer, putting together some book shelves, and the occasional odd job like drilling some holes into a plastic flowering pot. This screw driver is priced affordable at under $50 however it drains power extremely fast, I can hardly complete a 15 min. job without having to plug the thing back in. I also find that it does not securely fit drill attachments all the time. I imagine I will probably one day upgrade to a better drill. I am not a craftsman who does even a moderate amount of building, for those people I certainly recommend looking at a different drill. For the person like me who wants to complete the occasional task that requires an electric drill I would consider looking elsewhere also."
3,"Well written, not broad or deep enough, nor well-edited.","I enjoyed this book. I'm fascinated by the subject, and the writing is terrific. I was a bit disappointed with it, though, for reasons shared by many other reviewers.Of the 240 pages in the book, the first hundred pages move along well. So do the last forty. From page 100-200, though, the book bogs down in the story of the sinking of the Estonia. While it is a gripping story, it should have been limited to 50 pages-- the book's title is not ""The Sinking of the Estonia"". Issues like piracy and shipping finance could have healthily stretched the book to 300 pages total.Overall, though, I would recommend it-- with the proviso that it is not a full treatment of it's subject."
2,disappointing,"The book should have been named "" the Tragedy of Estonia"".Langwiesche is an excellent contributor to the Atlantic monthly, unfortunately he seems to be under the impression that a book is simply a compilation of several articles strung together.You will hardly learn anything new from this book.Although he is an excellent writer he should really just sick to periodicals.See other 2 and 3 star reviews for more detail, they hit the nail on the head."
4,"Great OS, awesome net capabilities","My Revo is like my baby. I love it. The OS is -very- stable and has a very good set of developers to go with it. I currently have programs like ICQ, SimCity Classic, Fairway (great golf sim app), Opera *fast* web browser, in addition to the great spreadsheet and word processor pre installed. It is very fast, speedy when downloading email and surfing...much faster than WinCE units I saw running with 3 times the MhzMy only gripe is that the memory is a bit small for power users that like to have alot of programs on it. But for the size it's great. And believe me, you get used to the no-backlight thing."
4,Not Merely a History Book,"A well written commentary on 2Kings. That is what I call a commentary of high standard evangelicalism combining both faith and scholarship and showing respectful treatment of biblical history. Hobbs considers 2Kings to be a composition of only a single author. For theological reasons the assumed author has placed emphasis on several topics - Elijah, Elisha, Jehu, Hezekiah and Isaiah, Josiah - from the source material available which he has dealt with more in-depth rather than other events more important in the view of modern historians. Hobbs offers a lot of explanations on the Hebrew, discusses different opinions, but focuses mainly on the major issues and has produced an in-depth commentary."
1,Never Received Game,"Unfortunately, I never received the game from my selected seller because he didn't have it for my console. So too bad."
2,Beep Beep,"Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages."
4,"Well built, and an automatic template, good and appropriate for the price point and the for the person with an inexpensive violi","I carved a universal template myself through patience and self determination. In the end, I didn't get the curve absolutely correct, so I decided to try again, this time with a curve I knew would be right. (Actually, I will shape my universal template to match this one too, so I'll have a spare).It seems well made, and should be fine. Obviously, if you're here buying a generic blank for a violin (like I am), you're probably not part of a philharmonic orchestra, and there's nothing wrong with that. This lets you learn a little more about how to work on a violin and saves you a couple dollars."
5,You'll be up past midnight reading,"I have seen the future - and it is Time's End. Anyone concerned about humankind's growing dependence on technology and growing indifference to intrusions on our privacy and personal autonomy will find this chilling novel of the not-so-distant future difficult to put down. Jake Mando is a fitting hero for the 21st Century, at a time when threats to our freedom from without can lead us to surrender the very things we seek to protect. It's a fast-paced read, where The Running Man meets Logan's Run, and you'll find this adventure is one that will stay with you long after you've finished."
2,"bad screenplay, bad acting, directing, editing, nothing but bad","ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later."
2,lost album,downloaded album to my wifes K-fire. Tried to download it to our cloud so I could hear it later on my K-fire. Can't find it anywhere????
2,"Too broad, too light","This book is visually impressive, but too brief and light to get a reccomendation from me. Van Creveld and Keegan are real heavyweights, and two of my favourites. Perhaps it is only because I consider their standards so high that this volume is a disappointment."
5,Why is this title out of print?,"This cd features two of the greatest legends of jazz. I cannot believe that it is out of print, while sub par recordings still are available in the stores. Buy it used if you get the opportunity!"
2,Daughters of Eve-A Put Down Book,"I love Lois Duncan and all her books, I've read so many of them but I have to say that this one was a boring book. I actually couldn't finish it. I went on to read a different one. I enjoyed the beginning, when the one girl was freaking out at the ceremony but afterwards it just was being drug on and on. I put it down. I may finish it someday, but I'm not sure. Hope this helps!! :) mwazxOx Krista Marie"
3,It was o.k.,"This was the first Lois Duncan book Iread,and I have to say it was o.k.,I mean she could of done better.There where too many characters and the ending was alittle disapointing.But besides that, I recomend the book to a teenager rather than a adult.(not as thrilling as expected by the cover of the book)."
3,interesting but no moral at all,"Daughters of Eve was one of the most interesting books i have ever read, but i wouldnt say it is good. I love how the characters r well built. But the moralo of the story, is there even one? is it that all men are sexist abusers? or not to listen to your art teacher? I really dont know.I could not believe how intensly developed the characters were. All of the girls and their parents, irene, peter,.When i was in the middle of the book i started thinking all guys were like the ones in this book. i started to question the men in my life and my position as a young women.At the end i was majorly shocked that nothing happened to Irene and that she just kept doing this to the club at school, and that Jane ended up in a mental hospital.!!!! wow. I really do think it is a must readw becuase of all the intense issues it raises, but dont go in it looking for a moral"
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read!,...i have read many books and i have to say that this book is my favorite. I checked this book out in my schoodl library i never knew how much i would love it. i took the book everywhere and i read it everyday day mor ethen once a day. this book is so unpredictable and when they flash you back to different places you just want to read more and see what happens. this author is one of my favorites and i recommend this book to everyone to read. there are so many secrets and lies and shocking things to read about. how can you not read it. once you start you have to finish.and at the end it tells you about every character in the book and what happend to them 3 years later.
2,"great music, great pianist","brilliant. wonderful collection of confrey rags, and the performance is stunning.i tried to give it ""5 stars"", but for whatever reason it will only let me give it two."
4,Great to have everything in one place,"I read another review on this product with a low rating and am wondering if they had a previous version. This product is very easy to use. We got it in the Ultimate Employer bundle. We use it to track our employee information (name, SS#, I9, hm address, ...), benefits, positions/salaries, time worked, vacation time, etc. It is very easy for anyone to jump on the system and find the information they want, or enter additional information. We have been very satisfied. Although the 50 standard reports meet our needs, we have looked at using the export feature to Microsoft Access to create a report for our payroll service."
1,Dinosaur!,This product is cumbersome - it is like something from the 1980's. I expected something useful and more up to date.
2,not working !!!,i have been taken this product for 3 months now and im still not prego :( im gonna try 2 more months of it before i quit. ill let ya know what happens
4,It worked for me once and using again while TTC #2,I used this product for three months and was able to conceive a healthy baby boy. Now that he's 15 months we're trying again and using FertilAid. It's been 3 months and we haven't gotten pregnant yet but I have had my first 29 day cycle in about 8 years. Before my cycles were anywhere from 35-48 days. Here's hoping that since my cycles is starting to regulate that another pregnancy is around the corner.
5,This works!,"I have never used any protection with my husband in the 9 years I have been with him, Im 26 and figured I couldn't get pregnant. I decided to try this before I go to the doctors and see what they could do for me. I had no idea this would work so fast! I only took this for 2 months then BAM I was pregnant! The pregnancy went great and I had a beautiful healthy baby girl! She is now a year old and I havent gotten pregnant again so I think im gonna order me some more. I had given the rest of my bottle to my neighbor that was trying to get pregnant and 3 months later she was pregnant."
3,Not sure yet,"I started taking fertilaid a month and a half ago after 6 years of ttc after having my other 2 kids previously with no problems and started my period exactly 4 days after starting them making it a 40 day cycle which is very good for me(I am extremely irregular).I did notice an easier period than usual so at this time I was thinking wow,these are great.I did opks every day after with no positives and now I'm on cycle day 45 with no period still.I have taken 3 pregnancy tests just in case and of course all negative so I'm not sure what to think.After a month and a half of taking these I was hoping to at least have starting my period earlier this time and have ovulated.I'm going to wait a little longer and if I still haven't started my period may have to stop taking them and see what happens."
1,Do not use...,"After I started taking this supplement, I stopped having periods all together. My OB/GYN had to put me on progesterone to induce a period after not having one for over 2 months. While it may just be coincidental, I would not recommend using this supplement to anyone!!!"
1,Publicity Stunt,"I cannot believe this woman - It is sickening how she has tried to capitalize on her daughter's fame by writing this book about her own life, which wasn't that interesting nor one from which one could learn much. She embodies the terms ""self-centered"" and ""arrogant."" I feel sorry for Jennifer having to grow up with a woman like that. Do not buy this book; it will only contribute to this woman's ego."
5,NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Burgundy Genuine Leather,Exceptional quality.I had an old one (1977 edition) and I was very impressed with that one from the point of view of the side column and the point 11 font.The updated version gives a much wider margin for note taking which I love to do while updating the language order.The stitching is of the highest quality (Smythe sewn) and all in all an excellent Bible for study with several cross references.Peter Sarjeant
5,Tasteful Erotica,"The black and white Photos are truly art, and the poetry is well suited to the photos. This is an adult book that stays where I can share it with my friends who enjoy beautiful art and poetry. This erotica is tastefully done and I am sorry that this book is no longer available it makes a great gift for special friends."
5,A must for any aircraft designer,"The book got to me in perfect conditions. I ordered it overnight and, of course, it got to me the next day. The world of aerospace engineering is rapidly evolving towards the use of supercritical airfoils, but there are still very good things to take away from this book, full of NACA 64 and 65 series airfoils. Definitely a must."
4,Very good,"I piced up this book at my librey because I liked the cover. I read the book in less then two days. Some of the reviews say that this book was boring and hard to get through. I found it to be exciting and sweet. I enjoyed the fact that two teensgers learned how important life really is. This wasnt a tipical summer love story where the people fall in love, and then the guy goes home. The boy Percy falls in love with Graziella and tells her that he will be back. There were some times where I got confused, which is why it only got a 4 but this is defently a book that I would recamend to anyone!!"
2,Not what we expected,My son is 23 mos old and really shows no interest in this toy. He will stand on it for about 1 minute - if that. And Barney is always falling over. If I had to purchase this product again - I definately would not!
3,Barney Dance Mat,"I bought this toy for my 22month old daughter for christmas. She loves dancing and I thought it would be the perfect gift. I was a little disapointed in her enthauaism for the produt, but that is purly an individual response. I have not had the problem with Barney falling over. We blew him up manually and then used a hand pump to fill completly, he hasen't fallen since.Invest in the hand pump, like the ones you find in a kit for an exercise ball."
2,very disappointing,my daughter LOVES Barney and I thought that this would be perfect for her. The only time she stepped on the mat in 3 days was on accident. The Barney kept falling off and deflating. It is going back.....
3,its ok but not all i expected,battery compartment its hard to but in the batteries first one i bought---didn't work second one is ok bute the barney need to be strong to stand the test of a two year old!!!!!!!!! but over all my daughter Beatle (2 years ) and 9 month old son luis love it!
1,Unreadable.,"Alberto Fuguet, The Movies of My Life (Harper, 2003)A trick does not a book make, no matter how interesting it is. And the trick ehre is interesting; Fuguet takes the structure of a noted director (can't remember who, because my brain is swiss cheese; Elia Kazan?)'s autobiography and turns it into the story of a family trying to make it. The beginning works very well, being a series of emails between the narrator and someone he met on a plane about why he's decided to simply abandon his career and sit in a Los Angeles hotel room writing this, and the structure is intriguing, but beauty is only skin-deep. Once you scratch beneath the surface, you find another Oprah's Book Club candidate ripe for the plucking, a dysfunctional family with no qualities to make it stand out from the rest of the dysfunctional family pack so popular in today's publishing world.If you like dysfunctional family novels, this will probably be right up your alley. The rest of you can safely avoid it. (zero)"
3,I am not a bridge player,"So I have to agree with another reviewer, I think I would have enjoyed this much more if I knew anything about Bridge. I have never played in my life and know nothing of teh game so a lot of the dialouge meant nothing to me. Not one of my faveorite but still an ok read."
1,exasperating,There is nothing more exasperating than a contrived Christie plot. People somehow manage to constantly run into each other and suspects show up at fortuitous moments. Christie tries hard to complicate the plot but only succeeds in stretching credulity. The ending was hardly convincing. Not one of Christie's better works.
5,Excellent workout video!,"This Gilad's workout video is excellent. If you want to keep in shape and keep with your working life, this video is for you. It is divided in several exercises that you can select if you don't want to follow all exercises. I do it that way, I select some exercises and make them in the morning or at night. It helps me being healthy in my busy life!."
5,The Best of Gilad yet!,The best yet! Some of it familiar and some new moves. It will really wear you out even if you have been doing older Gilad videos. I love it! Fast paced and really well balanced.
1,Gilad Express Workouts,This product arrived damaged. I returned it to the vendor. I am still waiting for a replacement DVD. I am not happy.
5,Amazing,"I have been a DDR fan since 5th Mix came out in Japan, and I love every moment of it. I've never been one for console gaming (I usually play StepManis or In the Groove on my computer), so the only console I have owned was an old PlayStation (one). Konamix is the latest (relatively speaking) that was released for the PS1, and it's essentially like DDR 5th Mix with some different skinning (More like 1st-3rd Mix than anything). All in all, a fun game."
5,The Best,I love difficult can easy games and this is it you can have it on an easy song or a hard you can check your calories and you can make your own rotine and theres no one staring at you like in the arcade!!!!
4,Glass bottles,"Considering all the news about plastics, this is the safest way to go in my opinion. These bottles are a little heavy but very sturdy. My daughter has dropped it several times on the wood floor without any problems. A bottle cover is a good idea though, we use a neoprene cover since she drops it all the time. The 8 oz. size is the best size too."
3,pretty darn good cd,just wish there was more of the tribal drums as in the end of the movie. That would have made the cd gloden and caused me to shake my groove thang.
3,Disappointing,"Having seen the movie, I should have been more prepared for a ""soundtrack album"". Most of the tracks are pretty interchangeable, except for three. The first track is the voice-over, by Keisha Castle-Hughes (Paikea), from the beginning of the movie. The last two tracks, ""Waka in the Sky"" and ""Go Forward"" include Maori chanting: ""Waka"" features the villagers' Haka, and ""Go Forward"" is the canoe-paddling song. Both are vibrant, distinctive and engaging, and I can listen to them over and over.As for the rest, all the tracks begin with a ""doooom"" tone... very unoriginal. However, the similarity of the high notes to both whale song and the mourning cries (""Au-we! Au-we!"") is very nicely done. I will keep this album in my collection, but cannot say whether the musical trickery and two engaging tracks are enough to turn this album into a ""must have"" for everyone."
3,Same Workout on Other DVD,"I wish someone would have mentioned that this is the same workout as on 5 Day Fit Pilates, which I already own. It's a nice 30-minute workout, and the production values/scenery is high quality, but I'm very disappointed. I was hoping for a more intense workout, and more variety on the ""bonus"" workout, but it was not to be. Boo."
2,Garnet ring disappoints,The ring I received had several scratches on the big stone and the side stones were lighter in color and didn't match. I returned it.
4,"Yummy, Gummies...","Tasty in several ways, especially if you want to pucker up and then enjoy a fruit.."
3,Luther for Our Times,"Dr. Ernest Schwiebert, who died on March 10, 2000 at the age of 104, described this book as his greatest accomplishment (Deshler, OH Flag, March 23, 2000). Researched and written on location in Germany in 1950, the book analyzes conditions surrounding the Lutheran Reformation according to history, politics, the church, and academia - a daunting task for one book. But the author organizes his material well and one of his specialties, the analysis of the Reformation as a university movement, comes through clearly and cleanly in this work. Both those familiar with Luther's life and those exploring it for the first time will appreciate how Dr. Schwiebert brought scholarly research on the topic into the reach of many people."
4,Backyard Baseball,"Backyard baseball is de bomb! i think it's really cool that u can link and play and stuff like that. the only thing that's not the perfect thing about the game is the created players, because you can't make them that good. but the good thing is that they gain experience points if you choose them in a season. i link with my brother all the time."
3,Most Overplayed of 2002,"Enough already. So overexposed and overplayed, I've grown to hate it. Her voice is nice enough, but come on, the album is not THAT spectacular; it's just that the musical standards have fallen so low in this country. By the way, you can also apply to this review to ANY Dave Matthews Band album, minus the part about the nice voice."
4,Great debut,"What a great start to a very promising career. Her style may not be for everyone but it is nice to finally be able to listen to a talented young voice singing in the classical jazz style as opposed to the usual pop-star trash that is constantly being pumped out. My personal favourite songs are numbers 1,4,5,6 and 11. I am looking forward to her next cd."
4,"Grab a cup of ""joe"" and enjoy!","Norah Jones' COME AWAY WITH ME garnered a great number of Grammy awards for good reason: it's flat-out good music. Her soft, silky but strong voice carries this low-key album across musical genres in rare form. It's groovy enough to be jazz. It's catchy enough to be pop. It's accessable enough to enjoyed by almost everyone.Reminicent of music heard in many a fine piano/jazz establishment, this is not the kind of album that warrants intense, purposeful listening. It's humble, mininalist mentality and spartan sound are its beauty, making it perfect for grabbing a warm cup of coffee, a good book (or a friend), and enjoying a quiet evening together.She's surrounded herself by great musicians and producers, so judging by her debut, we'll be able to expect great things from Ms. Jones as she, like fine wine, improves with age. COME AWAY WITH ME comes highly recommended to those seeking a pitch-perfect album with which to unwind."
2,Norah needs to live a little,"I was very disappointed with this artist. I don't even think she is a jazz singer in the true sense. This record and its selections are flat. The artist lacks shading, nuances in her vocal presentation. Could it be she has to live a little, learn a little before she can take her place with the great jazz female vocalists who preceded her? Yeah! the voice is clear but needs developing. Compare her to a young Sarah Vaughan or Carmen McRae, even Peggy Lee and you'll hear there's nothing to her first CD. I am 70 yrs old and was born and grew up in Harlem. I've seen and heard the greatest vocalists at the Apollo Theatre and other clubs, music halls etc.,in New York."
3,"A refreshing sound in the music field, but not impressive","Norah Jones' ""Come Away with Me"" hit paydirt after winning so many Grammys in 2003, so I bought it out of curiosity. Well, it is good, but not great.Her voice is tender and every track is beautifully written. I like to listen to it before going to bed or try to fall asleep. Nevertheless, except ""Don't Know Why"" and ""Come Away with Me,"" the other tracks sound one and the same. To rectify this monotone, maybe Norah should also try something new in addition to light Jazz and soft pop.Despite the weaknesses, it's thrilling to have another talented diva on the market. And her debut work is certainly worth praising."
5,She has an angel's voice,What else is there to say. Her voice is beautiful. Great music for a lazy day.
4,Slow and Mellow,"This is an excellent cd for those mellow times, I'm thinking late nights, either alone or with company. It's been solid background music for me many times, including paper writing and book reading. It's very quality music, and though I wouldn't recommend it to get you started in the morning, it is a good cd to settle you down after a long day."
5,Beautiful,"I can't express how beautiful and haunting Ms. Jones' can be. ""Don't know why"" got me interested but that's far from the best on the album. ""One flight down"" evokes a melancholy feeling that's reminiscent of Billie Holliday, and I know that's a bold statement. This girl has a beautiful future ahead of her, hopefully she gets the great production she got on this work."
3,pleasant but not jazz,"I'm not going to be a Norah-hater and give this one star, but please, folks, if you want to listen to a good jazz singer, you've come to the wrong place. Sure, the CD is easy on the ears, kind of dreamy, and Norah's delivery has interest (I actually thought of a young - and better - Rickie Lee Jones at times!), but Billie Holiday? Put Lady Day on and compare for yourself. No comparison. So maybe Norah has some potential if her next effort attempts true jazz feeling and swing.In the meantime, check out some great contemporary jazz singers like Meredith d'Ambrosio, Tierney Sutton, Diane Hubka and the late Susannah McCorkle. You'll be happier for it."
5,Norah Jones' Masterpiece.,"Come Away With Me is without a doubt Norah Jones best album to date. I was a little late on discovering it but it's worth owning. The music style is accessible but not too much pop either, it has a lot more contemporary jazz and blues influences. it. She has an excellent voice and is very talented. She sings in a more low-key style but still has a decent range rather than typical higher octave in pop music. I don't usually listen to a lot of mainstream music but Come Away With Me is excellent and better than most other mainstream singer-songwriters. Painter's Song, One Flight Down and Feelin' The Same Way are my highlights of the album but they're all good."
5,"Beautiful, elegant, relaxing, and addictive!","Since I've been hooked on her music, I cannot listen to anything else. I try new stuff every now and then, but I keep coming back to this. I've listened to these songs hundreds of times, but I never get tired of them."
3,ONLY 22?!?,"DIANNA KRALLS' FINE BUT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE ""FLAVOR OF THE DAY"" JAZZ SINGERS FOR 20 YEARS.WHAT GETS ME TO BUY A CD IS SOMETHING THAT SEPERATES IT FROM THE REST.LIKE TOM WAITS NORAH ROBERTS AIN'T AFRAID TO TAKE A RISK.IS IT GREAT?..NO.CAN YOU PIGEON HOLE HER VOICE INTO ANY GIVING COMPARISON?FOR ME SHE BRINGS TO MIND 20 DIFFERENT SINGERS WICH MAKES THAT ""COMPARISON VOICES"" DEBATE MUTE FOR ME.SHE EVEN WRITES HER OWN SONGS!I ADMIRE THE RISK THAT SHE TOOK BY KEEPING THE GREAT MUSICIANS ON THIS ALBUM BEHIND HER TO RELY ON HER OWN VOICE AND STYLE.SURELY THIS WILL DISSAPOINT SOME SOME MUSIC AFFICIANADOS BUT THIS IS GOING TO PAY OFF.LOOK FOR A GRAMMY NOD THEN A GRAMMY WIN ON THIS OR HER NEXT ALBUM."
5,Loav Nora Jones,"I play the album all the time and just love it. I did not know who was singing in the movie ""TwoWeeks Notice"" and called my daughter who knows every song ever pressed. I had heard some of Miss Jones previous songs but did not know who she was.I was pleased with the quick delivery and am very pleased with the service.Thank you so much."
4,Very nice,"Given what's on the market today, Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air. She doesn't have all the secrets of life at 22, but she's a good sight further down the road than some of these 18 year olds.Jones has a beautiful, smoky voice that makes this album perfect for rainy day listening. I put it on to unwind, and I must confess that I don't pay so much attention to the lyrics. Some of the song lyrics I love, like Come Away with Me and Don't Know Why, but overall the beauty of this album is in the arrangements of the melodies and the loveliness of Jones' voice, which are worth the price any day. The Nearness of You has to be one of the best versions I've heard. Truly a talent that will stick around and get better with age."
5,I can't wait for more music by Norah!,"After reading of this newcomer in the Dallas Morn. News, I immediately went to [a local store] and bought it. I believe I've listened to it EVERY night since - and most mornings getting ready for work. It is outstanding - should NOT be classified as most artists are. Let's create a genre just for her!!! She is captivating..... Bring me more!"
5,Voice of An Angel,"Norah Jones has the voice of an Angel, this album has all the wonderfully written songs. Just feels like you're in a Jazz club listening to her lovely voice everytime i listen to this CD. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Jazz or blues. But anyone who is into other types of music should try this out you won't be disappointed."
2,True Talent?,"Norah Jones has a nice voice, very reminiscent of Rickie Lee Jones however, I didn't find any tunes which I found that memorable. In fact, There weren't any tracks which were medium to up in tempo. All tracks were very much the same in style and presentation. Maybe she should take a lesson from Rickie Lee Jones on how to groove. Grammies have become a disgrace in recognizing true talent, maybe they need some holes drilled in their ears."
3,how pleasant,"This is a pleasant enough album, but too monochromatic and lightweight for my taste. Good backround music, for sure. But a GREAT new talent on display? Not really.I get the feeling that people who really love this record have not been exposed to a lot of music in their lives. Certainly I can agree that when compared to what else makes it to the radio or MTV/VH1 these days, Nora Jones is a breath of fresh air and nice change of pace. But if you have exposed yourself to many lesser known artists, you already know how much great and unique stuff is out there that is missed by the masses. In this context, Nora isn't particularly unique or talented.Go download or borrow cds from the library of some artists you've heard or read good things about. You'll begin to discover a lot of great music. For example, in the jazz realm, try Patricia Barber. She's a bananna split ice cream sundae compared to Nora Jones's vanilla scoop in a cup."
2,Surface music,"Even taken as a pop album, which this is, Norah Jones is a perfectly pleasant singer, but hardly memorable. Seeing her live convinces me that there is not a lot beyond what you see and hear -- substance and resonance just aren't there, and certainly no sense of musical adventure -- which makes her far from jazz. She's pretty and likable in that college-dorm girl kind of way, but there seems little to indicate musically that there's a long-haul career ahead. This is more Edie Brickell than Rickie Lee Jones, for example. She's somehow connected with the zeitgeist of the moment, and there's nothing wrong with that. But she, and her material, are nothing special. The most interesting thing about the album is legendary producer Arif Mardin's return to a more stripped-down intimate sound. But the songs themselves -- they're easy to listen to, and instantly forgettable."
4,Not Your Kid's Music,"This is a good mood setting music. It's very soft, slow, sexy and seductive. The song ""Don't Know Why"" that's played on the radio so much is not even the best song on this album. There's an interesting jazzy rendition of Hank William's ""Cold, Cold Heart"" that I absolutely love. The song, ""Turn Me On"" is a great slow dance song. So is ""Nearness of You."" Nora's voice is romantic and soothing. This is a wonderful album for lovers. Put the kids to bed, pour a couple glasses of wine, turn down the lights and slow dance in front of the fireplace."
1,"""F""","Terrible recording. Voice sounds like it's coming thru a wall & lacks clarity, resolution, etc. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good."
1,Cookie cutter CD for the masses,"Sleepy CD that sounds like everything else you here on the radio. All the songs are the same, and nothing ever changes about her musical styles or the songs she's singing.There are much better CDs to spend your money on. Don't buy the Grammy hyped CD. Spend it on something better. I wish I could give it zero stars, but they don't make that!!!"
2,Mediocre - Get Eva Cassidy Instead,"I know I'm going to go against the popular grain here but it seems like the positive reactions to this album are less about its great content than it is about finally hearing something different than what is typically forced upon us by the music industry. For those of us not clued in to this genre before Norah Jones it truly may seem better than what it truly is...quite frankly Norah Jones is certainly talented but this collection of one-note music has been waaay overrated...its like listening to the same song over and over on each cut.The reality is that record executives saw the incredible, suprising reaction & record sales of the late great Eva Cassidy (from Washington D.C.!). So, they went out and found someone who had a sound similar to hers...that was Norah Jones. So, if you like the sound of Norah Jones you will be thrilled by the original - Eva Cassidy - but it's like comparing jug wine to a vintage cabernet."
5,On the other hand...,"Norah Jones' music is mellow and laid-back, it's true. But it's also very good indeed, which is why she was Billboard Number 1 with this album. Soulful, talented, different - excellent."
3,Mature beyond her years? Don't think so...,"As a singer, Norah Jones has something... and maybe that's a promise of truly memorable music down the road. (Hey, I hope so -- for her sake and mine.) But she hasn't created that memorable music yet. Right now, I get the sense she's not sure what she wants to do with her voice, with these songs. She seems to be trying out different things...well, just because she can, not because they fit her. I hear lots of different singers in her approach...a whole lot of Ray Charles for one....but don't get a real sense of who Norah Jones is as a singer. Also, unfortunately, the piano playing could have been better. I'm actually surprised that Blue Note has put all its muscle here...behind what is a reasonable but nevertheless rookie effort when there's legit polished talent out there just waiting...but hey, don't mind me, listen for yourself..."
1,Warning! Invasive copy protection. Might not play on your cd player at all!,"Great cd, unfortunately the copy protection prevents me from putting it on my ipod, and worse yet, the cd won't play in most of my cd players. Stay away!"
5,NITROGEN,"I forget the atomic number for Nitrogen and I'd like to give my brother Keynote an atomic wedgie, but nevermind about all that. This album by Norah is goody good. She sings a little like she's been supping helium balloons, but the music is pleasing to my little ears and soothing to my saved soul. This is a good 'un."
1,One Star for ...,"... filing this CD under ""Jazz"". Only a generation spoiled by years of radio listening could come to the idea of calling anything (anything!)that sounded different ""Jazz"". But it isn't. It doesn't swing, it has little to no improvisation, it's got no compositions to speak of. You could call this music ""Popcountry-Kitsch"" or maybe campfire music, the same thing Michelle Shocked did 20 years ago. But in the genre of ""Popcountry-Kitsch"" it sure deserves 5 stars.Just listen to any song by Charles Mingus and you'll understand what I mean!"
2,Overrated,"She is a way too lucky lounge singer. I think many people think when she's singing these songs she's poured a lot of heart and soul into them. However, she did not write these songs, and her voice is just her trying make herself sound as if she's Billie Holiday; when you hear her talk her voice sounds nothing like her singing voice. She's just another talentless young wannabe star the music industry throws at us in a different formula than that usually used in the pop music genre. The most credit she has for herself is that she can play the piano; and there's plenty of piano players way better than her."
2,Zzzzzzz...,"She's got a good voice, and she can play -- but this just about puts me to sleep. Buy this and you'll never need to buy Sominex again."
2,REMINDS ME OF JANIS JOPLIN,I never heard this singer before but thought I would give her a try and quite honestly did not care for her at all. She is so pretty though. She sounds alot to me like Janis Joplin but then I did not care for her years ago either. Sorry.
4,Perfect Companion to a Glass of Wine and a Snuggle,"Norah Jones is a seductive interpreter of these songs. Funky, torchy, some just plain fun, take your pick. Her voice is easy to listen to. It has a way of growing on you after a few listenings. Moody and sensuous, the rhythms and feel of this disk are enchanting. Put it on when you're with someone you like a lot. Have a glass of wine or something from a brandy snifter. There's not another pop recording on the market that can match it in that setting. The instrumentation is sparse, in a good way. Guitar, piano, violin, accordian (!!) sexy, soft and gentle, weave their way in and out of Jones' vocals. The accompaniments don't get in the way. But this is really all Norah's outing. The musicians are true accompanists. I wouldn't call this jazz. It has more of a pop feel to it, but damn it's good."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This is a good album, but it definitely has its flaws. Norah definitely has an amazing voice and she really conveys a sense of sweetness and seductiveness effectively. That said, the album is a bit light on some elements. First, the arrangements tend to be sleepy and similar to one another. She has a good mix of jazz and other styles, but there is never much energy to the tunes, and despite talented musicians, the instrumentals seem lacadaisical. Also, her lyrics are irritating to me in a few places, where the writer is obviously trying too hard to force a rhyme. For example, one verse in the title track has the lines ""Come away with me on a bus...where they can't tempt us."" In an otherwise sweet and genuine sounding song, these lines seem reminiscent of Dr. Seuss. So while I would rate the album as solid overall, there are definitely some issues that keep it from being great."
3,come away with me,"My favorite song in this album was ""Come Away With Me"" - that was the specific reason for the purchase. The song was one of the best that Jones has ever done. The rest of the music is mediocre."
5,Amazing Debut from Norah Jones,"This is a great album from an artist who promises that she has much more in store. Yes, she is young, and her vocal range is not all that broad, but still the music on this CD is superb. And thank you, Norah, that I don't have to look at your belly-button. Yes, a young female singer, and she's dressed!! That's because, she's a true singer, a musician, and an artist not a model doing videos, though she is beautiful and the video for ""Don't Know Why"" is gorgeous, just one highlight from the album. Others include ""Turn Me On,"" ""The Nearness of You,"" the stunning ""Painter Song"" and ""Something Is Calling You"" (on the import version)."
2,monotone,"If you like every song sung the same way in the same key and without expression, then this album is for you. Ms. jone has vocal potential, unfortunately it isn't evident on this recording. For maximum listening enjoyment, especially when it concerns ""Turn me on"", I reccomend the late and forever great, Nina Simone."
5,Class with a capital C. L .A. S. S.!!!,"The first time I heard Nora Jones on my radio in my car I just about pulled over to make sure I was hearing what I was hearing!With all the other ""vocalist's"" on the air waves, I had had enough of the same old,same old. She sounds like an angel! Her voice is so natural and just flows. My hubby and I saw her lastnight in concert... a little nervous not having heard much about her concert voice, she came out on stage ever so graceful.... and we were NOT disappointed. A classy lady! Celineand Barbara could learn alot from Nora. I'll tell them the first 2 lessons, #1 Don't scream, be natural #2 Drop the "" I'm better than you attitude!"" I can't wait for Nora's next c.d."
3,Great music but there are issues on the vinyl,"This is a great album. I have the CD and SACD versions of it and decided to buy the vinyl.I noticed that although the sound is close to the SACD version, there are some noticeable flaws on the sound on the vinyl.It seems like there are vinly pressing issues. I hope they will fix this issue."
4,Beatiful throwback,"I really like the whole jazz/country thing going on, it suits her interesting voice well. She is a talented musician in every sense, and I commend her work. The only thing i wish for is a little more variety, but mellow works for her."
5,off the chain,"I purchased ""Come Away With Me"" about three months after it was released and knew after listening to ""Cold Cold Heart"" that she was going to win a Grammy. Though I liked ""Don't Know Why"" very, very much, I was entranced by ""Cold Cold Heart"" and ""Painter's Song"". And ""The Nearness of You"" lifts my spirits out of the deepest rift. I can't wait until I hear more by Ms. Norah Jones, and I am so happy that she is coming to the Dirty South this summer. Though it's probably not the first time, I just get so caught up with college I can't pay attention to everything at once. Anyway...Congrats on your Grammy's Norah and we're ready and waiting for more! :-)"
2,"Pleasant, but what's all the fuss about?","The industry is hungering for a beautiful, young icon to take up the torch (literally) of the old classic styles. Unfortunately, this hunger blinds them to the mediocrity of this particular release. A couple of the tracks are quite pleasant but otherwise the music is boring (think Yanni.) I saw her live and her stage presence was limp at best. One of the reviewers here wrote ""This girl is HOT!!!"" If she weren't 22 and beautiful, would anyone be listening? Oh well, maybe I'm just jaded. Certainly there are a lot of popular singers out there with worse voices!"
3,Give me.....,"...Diana Krall for a real jazz experience. I love this womans voice but give me some range. Please just stretch a little out of the soothing, cool, raspy voice, sultry as it is. I can't wait for the next several CD's to see if she has legs to keep the pace at a run."
5,"Sings like Billie, Ella, etc.","This is such a great CD. Norah Jones doesn't have the aged appearance of someone who could sing lyrics so beautifully, yet she does with wonderful grace. The sweeping tunes really stirred me. Definitely a must for your CD collection!!"
3,Overrated,"I agreed. She's got the looks and voice, & could easily get a 3-star. But the problem is, if you're a true jazz lover, you'll find it overrated. One wonders why she grabbed so Grammies.... the quality of the music industry is plummeting i guess. Anyway, if u just wanna get some easy-listening music, this will suffice."
3,Mystified by the comparisons,"I was recommended this by Amazon and they are right, I do like it. However, the comparisons to Billie and Diane strike me as odd. First, the album is much more bluesy than jazzy. Ms. Jones' voice sounds nothing like either, in my opinion...Finally, as nice a voice as she has, Ms. Jones' phrasing and piano don't hold a candle to Krall."
2,A voice that doesn't do the songs justice.,"-A word to the wise: This album is overrated.This album fell short of my expectations. While the song list is good, the voice that sings them is not. It is raspy, monotone and lacking emotion. After repeated listening, striving to find the element that bewitched the Grammy judges, Norah's voice failed to grow on me; instead, it began to sound like fingernails on a chalkboard.Sorry, Norah, keep working at polishing that voice.Instead of falling for all the hype behind this album, take a good look at Eva Cassidy, a 'newbie' just like Norah Jones. The only thing that separates Eva from Norah is the voice; refreshing, full of colour and emotion. Eva's singing skills far surpassed those of Norah (she passed away in 1996), and is well worth a listen.-"
2,Don't go away with Norah Jones,"I don't understand why Norah Jones is so big and impressive. She didn't even write her big hit ""Don't Know Why,"" yet garnished a lot of Grammys for it anyway! In my opinion this girl is an overrated performer; Vanessa Carlton definitely should've walked away from the 2003 Grammys with Song of the Year for her very own penned ""A Thousand Miles;"" Avril Lavigne's ""Complicated"" hit was even a better choice than Jones's ""Don't Know Why"" tune. I think Norah is talented but I think the pop market isn't her cup of tea. Like I said already, folks - an overall boring listen."
4,I love this young lady...,"I have to agree with the others - the SACD analog mix in 5.1 was a blunder(4 stars). I borrowed this from a friend for a test run. I have the same content on DVD/video - Very nice... - When I choose to listen only - I just turn off the TV and listen to a very good 5.1 DD/EX version. I admit it is not quite the quality of SACD but very good nonetheless. Spyro Gyra has 2 SACD's available and they are the standard for SACD comparison - absolutely flawless... Waiting for 2 of my all-time favorites on SACD - Eat a Peach and Live at the Fillmore from the ABB... SACD is just a small notch above DVD-Audio - although with DVD-Audio you can also listen on most any DVD player that supports DTS, DD-5.1 and DD-Stereo. SACD's are more dicriminating - I bought the Onkyo DVSP-800 specifically because of the SACD and DVD-Audio discrete analog and outstanding DVD-progressive scan video capabilities..."
4,Relaxing and lovely- but not jazz,"There's been a lot of debate over this CD and what genre it represents. I don't really care what it is supposed to be- but it is peaceful, light and has a sweetness about it that is not sappy or cheesy. I really enjoy it and I think Norah Jones has a great voice. But let's be real- it's not jazz and it doesn't seem to be reaching for more than just being a pleasing and enjoyable album, which is fine! The lyrics are simple and short but she has a way of giving them some life and her young soul comes through. Buy this if you want something to lounge to or want to hear a new voice- but not if you are seeking something more ambitious than that."
5,AWESOME CD!!,"I don't usually listen to this type of music but I heard ""Come Away With Me"" and decided to get it and man was I surprised to find that there wasn't a bad song on the entire cd. I have had the cd about a week and haven't listened to anything else and I am planning to go see her in concert in August. She is awesome!"
4,Smooth and Soothing,"After hearing Norah Jones' two hit singles, ""Don't Know Why"" and ""Come Away With Me"" I decided to buy this album.At first I was a little dissapointed because there were no upbeat songs but this has become one of my favorite albums for that reason.It's one that you can put in your cd player on a rainy day and just relax.Her voice is just so smooth and soothing and the music has a country/blues feel to it.I reccomend it to anyone who liked the first two singles or loves easy listening.You'll love this album!"
5,Kept Growing On Me Until 5 Star Sensation,"I liked this album at first but thought it was overhyped. Now that I've listened to it a great deal more, I've become a fan. Jones really has a very seductive, beguiling voice that works its magic on the listener time and again. It is hard to imagine anyone not being moved by ""Come Away With Me"" and ""Don't Know Why."" She also does a magnificent rendition of ""The Nearness of You,"" which I thought had already been done to death. I was wrong. I don't like her father's music (Ravi Sankar) and probably wouldn't have listened to her if I'd known they were related (assuming, wrongly, that they'd sound the same). Jones won 5 Grammys via this recording and I'm not surprised."
1,Awful,"This card is awful. I have a 3 megabit cable connection, however when using this card, I can only download files at about 20 kilobytes/second as opposed to 300+ on my other cards."
3,A solid dishwasher... but it WILL break.,"I've had two of these dishwashers over the past year-and-a-half. This product perfectly cleans four place settings using a short amount of time and a small amout of water. It made life for my wife and I much easier, as we didn't have the space for a full-sized dishwasher. However, after 6-7 months, both dishwashers stopped working due to a weak and faulty motor and customer service was extremely difficult to work with. If not having to wash dishes by hand for 7 months is worth $200 to you, then get this product. If you are expecting a long lasting piece of equipment, do not buy it. It is a wonderful piece of equipment when it is working."
3,"This is good, but....","it will break. It's great when it's working, but within a year it will stop working and it won't be covered by the very limited warranty. I recently bought a Haier, but it doesn't hold as many dishes and is taller than the Danby so it doesn't fit under the cabinets."
1,where's the fine print?,"Unfortunately, the description did not state that this game was uncompatible with XBox 360 and that there is no download from Microsoft to make it so. Not being familiar with this game I did not know this fact and thus, I can't play it. It makes a great dust collector."
2,SSX on xbox not 360,This game SSX on tour is an amazing game. I had it for ps2 and it was all I played. It was the most awesome game ever. I sold my ps2 and bought an Xbox 360. I then bought this game to use on my Xbox 360. I bought it thinking that it would work on Xbox 360 as do most other original Xbox games. Unfortunately it doesn't work on Xbox 360. The backwards compatibility doesn't work. So im bummed out from that. Only if I still had my ps2... ah well hope this helped.
2,Go Buy Grand Theft Auto 3 Instead!!!!!!!,"This game is such a let down I can't tell you!as I'm sure you know, this game is based on the career of a stuntman. going through several stunts for different movies while in career mode. The PROBLEM with this game is you are paid to do scenes EXACTLY as the director wants you to.You are never given any set up as to how the stunt will go! you just hop in the car and hope you can do as instructed a split second before you get there, and if you miss, you'll be starting the scene over. basically you need to do each stunt over and over until you can get through every part perfectly. NOT FUN!!! the ONLY thing this game has going for it is the graphics, which I quickly lost sight of with frustration.This game is made by Atari, and Reflections. the makers of the great detruction derby games. Sorry guys YOU BLEW IT THIS TIME!!"
5,Great Game,"I really liked this game. It is a little hard, but if your any good at driving games, you shouldn't have a problem with it. It is a fun and exciting game. This game is a must have!!"
1,STINKS,"This game is frustrating. Each level or scene, has about 10 stunts to do. in the VERY first scene, u have to go FULL speed and do a 180. First, you have to have the right car or you will end up failing the mission. If you go a couple of mph less than the full speed of the car than you wont jump high enough and the director wont like it. Also, I found myself doing VERY close to a 180 but it didnt count cuase i missed by a couple of degrees. THE COMMERCIAL OVERRATES THIS GAME!!"
2,Big Dissapointment,"Ok...it's not hard to find the gist of this game. The stunts are cool, yes, but it's unreasonably hard. I end up playing each level 15 or more times before I can beat them. If you ask me it ruins some of the things that should be fun like crushing cars in a monster truck rally. You are timed, so it makes it even harder, and I assure you that if you don't have a lot of patience, you'll end up burning the CD. I give it 2 stars because the stunts are nice, and so are the explosions, and I don't' know why people complain about the loading times, they're not bad at all. They really could have done a lot more with this game."
2,good grafics but confusing,"The graphics for this game are good, but it is too hard. If you do 1 mistake you have to start over again. Also the time limit is much too short. I would recommend this game to people who are good at hard games and enjoy car games."
3,Not too shabby....Not too great.,"I'll start it off by saying that this game is solid. The graphics, sound and gameplay all blend in to make this game smooth. But not real smooth. The control is a bit irritating. But overall, this is a good game that will keep you hooked for a good 20-25 hours. Pritty good game, but with some kinks that you can probably over look. Buy this game if you like crashing cars. :)"
3,Stuntman.,"Stuntman is a cool game,but can get annoying sometimes. there are levels that can frustrate you because of the perfection demanded, others are not so bad. I have yet to beat it as of this writing. and I have had the game for a long time. It was fun while it lasted."
1,Terrible !!!,"This game offers the realism of a sprite based megadrive driving game, the fun of hitting yourself over the head with a lead weight, the visuals of a naked 100 year old, the sound of a badly dubbed kung fu movie"
1,The worst 50 bucks ever spent..ever!,"I own this game and it is the biggest disappointment on the game cube's already slim library of games. Wrestlemania is the worst wrestling game ever made going all the way back to the nintendo days. It has no carrear mode, well no storylines any way. If you were looking for a wrestling game for its realism this isn't the game for you."
2,This is the WWE? PLEASE!,"I was very dissapointed with this game. It seems like it was rushed, and a lot of things were left out. I was happy with the full size Hell In a Cell, but the Create a Superstar mode stinks (not a lot of attire, moves, etc.) the Path of A Champion mode is boring because there's no storylines, and going for the Tag Titles stank because it's only a one player mode, so two guys can't gang up on the CPU (obviously so it has an advantage). THQ spent way too much time worrying about the graphics and sound quality, and didn't give hardly enough matches or environments. No Mercy for the N64 was a LOT better than this game."
1,iiiu,this is a good game you should get its awesome you cool wrestling stars and great graphics coool wrestling moves too you get to use chairs and bats my adviice to you is to get this game
1,Wrestlemania diaster,"Having loved the Aki/Asmik WWE games on N64 (Wrestlemania & No Mercy), i've been looking forward to this for a long time, & i've never been more disappointed by a game in my life. The game has been developed by Yukes, who did the Smackdown series on PS1 & 2' & while it looks very impressive when running on demo, it's awful to play. No story modes, no interference, a lack of some characters real theme tunes, a criminal lack of moves & the worst blocking system in the history of gaming. It plays like a very rushed, unfinished game, & is simply no fun to play at all. Avoid like the plague."
1,NOT LIKE NO MERCY,"this is the second review i've written for this game. i don't know what happened to the first.this game is just plain bad. it actually made me angry playing it. all of the people who wrote early reviews giving it good ratings should really have their reviewing rights taken away.bottom line, this game is horrible. if you absolutly have to have a wrestling title for the cube, get legends of wrestling. at least its honest about how bad it is."
1,They should have warning labels on games this bad,"this game [stinks] worst wrestling title ever,I HATE THIS GAME! the controls are awful,you can only do like 5 moves with a wrestler,they punch so fast,you cant even defend yourself,this game made gamecube look bad,only reason people gave this game 5 stars was because they wrote reviews before the game even came out,this game is like playing smackdown on playstation,BUT WORST! only thing good about this game is the front cover!"
4,Sugar Free but not calorie free,"This product uses Sorbitol and Asparthame to add sweetness, instead of typical sugar. The Nutritional Fact sheet on the back of the package said '35 Calories per 4 mints serving'. The packaging also said '40% fewer calories than regular Pep-O-Mint Hard Candy'. There are about 24 individually wrapped in a single bag. Personally, I think it leaves better after taste than other 'sugar-free' candies."
5,"GREAT MUSIC, and so stupid its smart","It's a sad miscalculation to see this album as simply an extended joke, becuase the musicianship is strong, the hooks are perfection, and all this is sustained underneath a hilariously complex and near genius jumble of rock and roll stereotypes being both imitated and ridiculed. And, oh, by the way...it's great music!!! 70's rock is punctured while being executed better than most 70's rockers (Electric Demons--pronounced ""Dee--MOHNs--In Love); 80's disco lyrics are dissected until you gag (""I invented the night""...come on, thats hilarious), and 90's Offspring-style hyperbeats are played perfectly (""Gay Bar"", I DARE you to not headbang AND crack up).Look, just get it, blast it, and see which of your friends actually has a sense of humor while you are loving the music."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this because of the famous George Bush / Tony Blair video. ""Gay Bar"" is a splendid punkish tune, and I was startled to learn that Electric Six were from Detroit, and not London. But that's it - everything else on this CD is background music. Two stars for ""Gay Bar"" and nothing more."
3,Does the Job,"These are good, but I use them rarely. Crumpets & english muffins are a ""sometimes"" food for us. Also good for making eggs though."
5,Muffin Rings,"I have only used them once and they worked great! Everyone loved them. Just don't fill them too full. Then you really will get 16 out of a batch. I only got 12 or 13, but we just split them and toasted them. Grease the rings and pan well with cooking spray and preheat the pan. They will slip right out. I did use bread flour to make them more of a bread texture. You can make them ahead and freeze them as the toast well. Good product."
1,Don't Buy,"Just received these rings as part of my order from Amazon. I gave them 1 star because it's the lowest possible. As ALWAYS delivery was earlier than I thought. There are 4 rings in the box, one not usable since the spot weld was open. When I contacted Amazon they immediately offered a refund, (always impressed with their service!!) Bottom line these rings are poorly made at best so I can't imagine them lasting."
1,Total crap,"I used 1 muffin ring, washed it, dried it and put it in the drawer. Went back 2 days later and it was rusted!I went to pull a second one out of the box to clean it - already busted before even getting to use - now it's just a long line of cheap tin, completely useless! These are going back tomorrow."
5,Muffin Rings,These are a great tool to have for gluten free baking. They can be used to make English muffins and I also use them as forms for hamburger buns. They shipped on time and arrived in excellent condition. Can't beat the prime shipping!
4,Clark's Coreen,I'm very satisfied with the Clark's Coreen shoes. They are made of genuine leather and fit well. They are big compared to size. I usually wear 9 and I ordered 7.5 and they are just perfect.
1,"not very inspiring, lacking in expression","The interpretation of this great music leaves much to be desired. Inability to play romantic legato, especially in chord sections, constant ignoring pianissimo signs, and inability to play anything in a truly expressive manner - all these add to a very pale interpretation. Choice of tempos is poor. The pianist seems to get excited only in forte passages. Even my Bose system did not help.Or, maybe it is all the fault of Naxos and their microphones?"
3,"Helpful in some ways, not in others","Though the software does take you through the Plan writing process in steps, I prefer to have the entire document right in front of me as I'm writing, so I created mine in Word. While I didn't care for the blank template offered in this software, the myriad of business and marketing plan examples were extremely helpful in getting me through my first attempt at composing a Plan of my own. You have your own library of successful business plans to reference."
2,"Move along, nothing to see here","I'm fully aware that this film is meant to serve as a ""throwback"" of sorts to old exploitation films. The problem however, is that it just doesn't work. It's not particularly clever, it's definitely not satirical, it's not even a fun movie to watch. I'm really not sure what the point of it all was. Also-if you are a Danny Trejo fan, and enjoyed ""Machete"" and think you might get some of that same kind of feel here, you'd be terribly wrong. Machete was an excellent exploitation throwback which knew exactly what it was with a wink and a nod to the audience. Modus Operandi on the other hand is just odd and nonsensical. Oh, and about Danny Trejo (which is the sole reason I checked this film out in the first place) if you calculated the entire time he's on screen, it may amount to about 5 or 10 minutes. His character is pretty much a throw away. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There's nothing to see here."
4,good for milk storage,"Since I wanted bpa-free bottles for milk storage, I decided to go with glass. The milk ususally does smell funny after being in any plastic bottle, but definitely smells better (i.e. no smell) after being in these bottles. The bottles also fit the Medela Pump in Style Advanced adaptors, so you can pump right into them. Another advantage is that the evenflow ring and cap comes with each bottle, and can be used to cover other plastic bottles from medela and gerber. You can also use these bottles to feed the baby, but I would recommend using a silicone nipple from Gerber.I recommend these bottles to other parents."
2,Dry Reading,"My Father told me the tale of Roy Davenport, and I was curious as to what a Submarine Captain in WW II had to do to be awarded the Navy Cross five times! I could not find any information in the various submarine books that have been written, until I discovered Admiral Davenport's book in my local library. Aside from the book being extremely boring, I found it interesting that the Admiral disliked Clay Blair's description of him in his book 'Silent Victory'. I got the impression that the only reason Davenport wrote his book was to defend himself over Blair's portrayal. What do you expect from a former Journalist? The book for the most part reads like a series of patrol reports, nothing original. The O'Kane or Fluckey books are a much better read. Fortunately, the book is available in most libraries. I don't see the publisher printing a second edition anytime soon."
4,"For the price, you cannot beat it.","My wife and I have used this player for over 3 years without any complaints. It's a no-frills player with an easy to use, compact remote control and a small footprint. It has component video out and digital coax audio out which is all most home theaters need."
4,Refreshing Book for Moms,"I liked the very personal and humorous stories featured in this book.And we all could stand to be a little less hard on ourselves about our imperfections and Barnhill is very encouraging in that way.I just wanted to read a little more about grace from a Biblical perspective.Overall, I recommend this book."
1,Ho-hum,Glad I got this book for free. I would have cursed myself for spending money on it. Haven't we heard all this someplace else before? There are far better books on the experience of aging. Not recommended.
4,Fantasy infused with myth,"The problem with most fantasy is that it is written entirely within the world of fantasy literature. It refers only to other books, creating a mirror world in which every image has been seen before, and every character is the reflection of many others. With the Chosen of the Changeling series Greg Keyes has escaped from this trap by infusing his story with anthropology and traditional myth. These books feel original because they return to the tradition of heroic stories told around the hearth that lies behind all fantasy. Keyes' heroes are like the heroes of epic, chosen by the gods to play parts in stories they don't really understand. The setting is magnificent, the writing fine. I enjoyed both of these books and recommend them highly."
5,"As tough and well-written as ""North Dallas Forty""","This is an excellent read. It is mystifying why this book did not sell in the numbers that ""North Dallas Forty"" generated. The late Pete Gent was the master of the well-written phrase. The book was both humorous and dramatic, giving the reader an insight into a world few are ever allowed to see. Gent pulls no punches and takes no prisoners. If you liked ""North Dallas Forty"" you will love ""The Franchise"". I note that some didn't care for the language. In the world of high-pressure athletics this is the way it is and it is authentic. Pro Athletes do not say ""fiddlesticks"" or ""darn"" when in competition. Gent accurately portrays the NFL patois as he has been there.One of the better books on the world of the pro athlete with great characters and dialogue."
4,wow,"I Have loved this book, since my childhood. Taylor Rusk, is a latter day hero. The mob's involvement all too real."
2,"""The Franchise""",It took mt two or three times as long to read The Franchise as the other books I have read in recent months. Overall I would not recommend it. it doesn't flow well. I ordered it because I'm a fan of professional football and was disappointed.
3,Not what it seems,"Having read several of Peter Gent's previous works judging by the cover, I assumed that this would be a story about football. Well , you can't judge a book by its cover. (Did somebody say that once?) Although, this book revolves around the front office and star quarterback of an expansion football team, there really is very little football going on. Instead, we are presented with some of the seedy side of a professional sports team with everything from point shaving to murder. Not an uninteresting read but it does get slow in the middle. The last section really picks it up and makes the read rewarding overall. Not as good as North Dallas Forty or The Conquering Heroes but certainly better than North Dallas After Forty."
2,Not Her Best Work by any Means!,"This book was one of many I've read by Joy Fielding. I've always enjoyed her work. However, this novel was easy to put down and dragged on forever with details of things I could've cared less about. The main character, Amanda, was not likeable at all. In real life, I wouldn't want to be around a woman like her. No morals, values, it's all about her. I agree with the other reviewers. The ending was a shocker, and I was surprised when I couldn't figure it out myself. Only after reading the book did I realize why I couldn't predict the ending. It was way too gross. I'm surprised the author went in this direction. If you want to read one of Joy Fielding's best novels, read GRAND AVENUE. You won't be disappointed with that one. I wouldn't recommend this novel...skip it and read something better."
4,do not buy this game!!!!!!!,"I was tricked into thinking this game would be as good as the movie was. It's really stupid, with HORRIBLE graphics. You can beat it in less than 1 hour. Don't beleive the good reveiws! Not buying this game will save your time and money!!!!!"
4,Classic Jimmy Sommerville,"Jimmy's ethereal naturally falsetto voice is truly showcased on this album that goes from awesome classic dance tracks to slower ballads. All with a synth, british pop feel. A true gem from the 80s British invasion!"
3,"Sorry to have the first so-so review, but....","I write this review after reading the whole series. Perhaps I would have written a more favorable review if I had written it after just reading this volume. The story here plods along very slowly, and may not appeal to anyone who is not used to Gene Wolfe's complex writing. If you want a really good Wolfe series, pick up his ""New Sun"" books. This one seems as if it hold a lot of promise, but ultimately disappoints."
3,no box,"The picture showed the pencils in a folding box for ease of use on a desk or for storage. And, it was listed as ""woodcase"" pencils. However, when it arrived it was in a plastic container that cannot be reused. So, there is no box to hold the pencils while you use them or for storage. Otherwise, the pencils are great. Prismacolor makes a great pencil for artwork/blending."
2,Misrepresented,The picture of this item is completely different from what I recieved. I recieve a small plastic package not the wooden/cardboard one pictured. I was very disappointed and promptly returned them
5,Spiritual Journey,This is a perfect blend of historical fiction with a slight touch of fantasy. Long but very well written and researched. It will provide a lot of hours of entertainment.Highly recommended
5,Byzantium,"An incredible adventure! And before you read the ignorant comments stating that Lawhead doesn't accurately portray the life of St. Aidan in Byzantium, know that this story is about a, ""composite character, whose life mirrors the kinds of priestly activities and political intrigues of his day.(stephenlawhead.com)""This book could easily be made into a big screen movie that would give the LOTR trilogy a run for the money!"
1,these guys are terrible,"this cd is horrible!!! durst, you should be embarassed to put out such crap. these guys sound like alice in chains rip-offs. trying to make it on somebody elses merits!!! damn imbeciles !!try originality and something of your own creativity. wow, like dudes, dont waste your money, but something with substance !!"
1,All the bad reviews explain it all...,"This band sucks. It seems like when this first came out every single was getting worse and worse. First song I heard was ""Control"" and i thought the lyrics were stupid (I Love The Way You Smack My Ass). ""Blurry"" was pretty bad too but it was nothing compared ""She Hates Me"" which has some of the worst lyrics and vocals i have ever heard. They even copied the riff from an old L7 tune.If you want to hear some real/original music then check out: Mindless Self Indulgence, Deadsy, System Of A Down, OLD Metallica, Marilyn Manson, NIN, Ramones, or any of the early-90's bands that made this type of music way before Muddle Of Pudd did (Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden)."
2,"Here's the Two Hundreth Sixty Eight review of a ""classic""","To all those ""rockers"" out there:Kurt Cobain resurrectedin the body of WesInstead of hearing phony lyricswe rather he stay deadCD is horrible.Don't purchase'nough said.Review not helpful?Than throw away you fifteen dollarsand dread.Sure, that smack your ass songis catchy and it will get stuck in your headbut when the mindset of the audience thatlistens to this comes clean,there will be no refund to amend."
1,Puddle of Garbage,"Let's face it people, this band is terrible! I mean, how many more awful Nirvana ripoff bands are we going to be subjected to? ""She Hates Me"" actually sounds like a really bad Ugly Kid Joe ripoff, and who would ever want to model their sound after them??? On this album's cover, there is a picture of a child with his pants down. Let's just hope that he's doing what he should by taking a leak all over this cd."
3,good album,"Blurry is one of the most overplayed songs on the radio in the history of music. I used to love the song- that was until I heard it about ten thousand times a day on the radio. Not sure if its worth buying, but definitely worth listening to."
4,Better Than Expected,"When I first heard the single ""Control"" I was completely grabbed by this great tune. I wanted to buy the disc, but I'd heard Fred Durst had put his stink all over it and it almost turned me off from it. Borrowed it from a friend and, at first, thought they were a Nirvana ripoff but in time the album grew on me. ""Blurry"" and ""Drift & Die"" are incredible tunes. Definately worth a listen!"
5,Wow. I consider myself officially told!,"I'm an avid listener of BBC Radio 1 and also a classical musician and have in the past been quoted as 'hating rock.' Well, I'm sorry. I WAS WRONG!!! I also hardly ever buy CD's 'cause I'm poor and usually only buy them once I've got about 5 people to tell me it's good! I heard Blurry on the radio and was so blown away, I went out and bought Come Clean. I sat down and listened to it and thought it was absolutely fantastic. Every song impressed me, each one reminds me of something different and suits my different moods. So, if you're in doubt about buying this album, you should just do it. I guarantee you'll love it. Unless you hate rock. In which case, you won't."
5,One of the best CD's of 2001,"There is only 1 song on this Cd that I don't care for: #6.Besides that, this is one of the freshest CD's that I have heard all year. Recommended for any alternative hard rock fan!"
1,Best CD I don't own!!!,"These guys are the epitomy of recycled crap that record companies are shoving down our throat. True fans of music, do not fooled by this ""band"". Save it for the teenagers, and/or mentally devoid who listen to anything the radio will play (Blink). These guys are shameless in the way they rip off musical styles, images, and even songs. Anyone heard the song ""I Saw Your Mommy"" by Suicidal Tendencies? If you have, you know what I'm talking about. If not, listen to it and be sickened at how similar ""She Hates Me"" sounds to it. If you want to find a new band with some originality, check out Queens of the Stone Age. Let this one collect dust on the shelf."
2,"Not Bad, 2 1/2","This cd, when you first own it, is amazing. But then, the singles start getting played out. The songs replayability wears thin. Then, all of the vocals start to get annoying, screechy and urgent, then you get to ""she F'in hates me"", the worst song of all time. When you wade through all of that, you get a decent cd. Basement and Never Change are the best songs. Radio hasn't gotten to em yet. Good for fans of grunge."
5,The Best album EVER (So far),WOAH! The first word I came up with when I heard the spine tingling songs on this brilliant album! I personally thought the first two songs were the BEST! It's a powerful debut album for them. I think they should release basement next because it's the best. It's just the best and I look forward to any further releases.
2,Awful,"This is a truly boring CD. Everything on here is unoriginal and old. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because, beleive it or not, there is worse music out there! I see no reason for this and many other similar CDs to be made. Once they come up with something more original I will be willing to listen. But that time has not yet come."
1,This totally blows,I just listened to this album. I can not believe what a freaking rip-off of Nirvana this is. The guy is clearly trying to sound like Cobain on every tune. I seriously feel ill...
5,"thanks fred, for putting out something worth it","I was really impressed when I purchased this CD. I was not exactally ""digging"" their first single, ""Control"", but I liked the video. Anyway, I took a chance, and I was suprised to find that I loved alot of the other songs. ""Drift & Die"" touched home with it's lyrical content. I'm what you would call an ""angry hard core"" chick, but sometimes I need something soothing, and this is about as soothing as it comes for me. ""Out of my Head"" is fun to turn up really loud in the car and sing. ""Blurry"", their second single is enough to make anyone cry. To sum it all up, I think it's alot different then alot of the music that's out right now, it goes back a way, I'd agree, but it's just good rock, and I find the sound of this guy's voice mixed with the good old drums, bass, and guitar, is refreshing. I'd recomend this CD to anyone. It rocks, and I think it's a great find."
1,A waste of perfectly good plastic,this is truly the heaviest most brutal most hardcore and most unbelievable album ive heard in a long time. hahahahaha. in all honesty anyone who even paid money for this piece of garbage should be sent to the electric chair for their own stupidity. these guys are just plain horrible. stop watching mtv and listening to the radio and find a good band. its really not that hard. while you trl watchers may have small simple minds but im sure you may possibly know of a place called Europe. In case you havent please consult a globe. anyways theres all sorts of bands over there like In Flames and Dark Tranquillity that actually do know how to rock.
4,Good CD,"I like this CD. It's not the greatest album ever made, and certainly not the most original, but oh well. Puddle of Mudd do what they do well. For the most part, the singles are the highlights, but some of the lesser known tracks are cool as well, like ""Nobody Told Me"" and ""Said"". ""She Hates Me"" is probably my favorite, it shows the band's less serious side and is a very fun song. It's also the only reason the explicit lyrics label is there. I'd recommend this album to fans of good, honest, hard rock without a lot of cheesy electronic garbage. And don't worry about Fred Durst, you don't have to hear his annoying voice on any kind of guest vocal or anything, and it doesn't seem like he had much influence on the band's style. THANK GOD."
1,Thats what they are. A Puddle of Mud and crap mixed together,"DON'T BUY THIS CD. It's trash, you see any body buying this cd WARN THEM IMMEDIATLY TO NOT BUY IT. The only time i heard this cd is when my friend first got it and popped it in the cd player... you better believe that this cd is trash. Who ever picked up this cd in the first place, and ""actually like it"" must have never heard of a thing called good music"" if i could give it no stars i would but it only goes as low as 1. you people who gave this cd 5 stars, i think you all are mentally ill, furthermore you people keep talking about how originality counts. Theirs nothing original about them. THERE THE SAME AS ANY OTHER BAND OUT THEIR! NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THEM AT ALL. one thing i'll give them credit for. They sure picked the best name that describes their music. ""A-P-U-D-D-L-E-O-F-M-U-D"
2,Not Silent Enough...,"Oh man, is this movie ever bad! Richard Dreyfuss, Linda Hamilton and Liv Tyler star in this convoluted yet ultimately stupid stew of tv movie cliches (the troubles of an autistic boy), a murder mystery and ""Fatal Attraction"" with a little ""Lolita"" for spice, because Liv's so hot. In fact, the only reason I watched this in the first place was because she's in it! Curse my manly urges for visiting this film upon me!It features one of the most misconceived plot devices yet employed in mainstream cinema- the kid can perfectly imitate any voice he's ever heard, and has a photographic memory, so they overdub his vocals, which turns him into a mini-""Mercury Theatre on the Air"" and the whole movie goes straight into the toilet. You have to see this scene to believe how horrible it plays.Really, if Liv wasn't in this, it'd be a 1-star effort."
3,Intriguing,"I liked this movie. I saw it a long time ago and would like to see it again. It was interesting, but I don't remember much about it. The only thing that is wrong with it is that Liv Tyler is in it. She has to be the worst actress in the world!!! I don't know why people like her. If she hadn't been in it the movie would be better, but I still liked it. I reconmend it."
3,Frenetic as Usual,"McCoy's music, influenced greatly by John Coltrane's approach and intensity, usually sounds like the aural equivalent of somebody screaming loudly at God while falling down stairs. And most of this album barrels along in such a manner. Eric Gravatt on drums stutters and interjects and generally sounds as if he's falling down stairs, presumably to fit in with McCoy's playing. It's jazz that does not relax or transcend. But there is a great track here, ""Mes Trois Fils"". That's a great theme, and beneath the barreling piano and horns the bass and drums augment it well."
4,Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus - Actor Bernard Guttenberg,"Yes, the holidays are over, but I thought I'd do a quick review on this movie anyway.Saw this movie for the first time this passed holiday (2006)season and thought it was pretty cute. I heard that Hallmark did a sequel to this movie & did I hear right is suppose to be put on DVD as well? Anyway, sequel's titled Meet the Santas; never could catch to watch it. Hopfully for 2007 Holiday Season it will be available on DVD--at least one would think and hope.At any rate, I thought by all the cast, the acting was done well. A very possible to add to my personal movie library.P.A. Gross"
4,Fun,"We watched this movie on TV and thought it was fun. Not a great message (not big into the believing in Santa Claus thing) but we like the actors. The movie is just a feel good show to watch, let your mind go numb and feel good watching a Chrismas movie. Still looking for the sequel on DVD."
4,In answer to another comment,"I had been searching for Christmas movies, and while doing so, I came across another comment about another movie ""Meet the Santas"" Yes there was such a movie, but impossible to find on DVD. It was on Hallmark last year (Ithink) and I was able to tape it so that I would have the sequel to the first movie ""Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus"""
2,Dumbest movie ever,"This movie was the biggest waste of money ever. As a adult who likes watching Christmas movies around the holidays, I bought this to add my collection. It's a low budget, G-rated movie that didn't hold my attention for more than 30 seconds, and I can't imagine it would hold anyone else's, young or old, either. The acting is horrible and the plot is boring."
3,Simple and Lovely,"This journal is beautiful. It's elegant but very simple and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an uplifting and thought-provoking daily devotional. I really like the slim design and leather binding. I would give more stars, but I have only had it for a short time and have not fully experienced it yet. However, from what I have seen so far, it is a great devotional."
5,Definitive versions,"I had jazz professors at the University of Utah that steered me toward Ella's music. They said that in order to understand jazz with all of its improvisation, one should listen to how the tune ""goes"" first. Especially in the Songbook albums, Ella sings them with little improv or embellishment, but reads the ink pretty straight. Several of the composers featured stated that they didn't know how good their songs were until they heard Ella sing them.Clap Hands Here Comes Charlie is backed by jazz trio/quartet, a departure from the more string-backed songbooks. Ella is a little more playful here.If you have all of her Songbook series, and you're looking to expand your Ella collection, I'd recommend starting here."
3,"Oh this makes me angry sometimes, a real bear to cart around","Good broadcast light, but heavy and for some reason just unstable. It does place out some serious light, but RAB is so much better.Spend the extra money and get a RAB. However w/ the 3 lamps, this sucker does place out EXTREME 360% light. Just wish they engineered it better, very top heavy. The manufacturer should consider aluminum."
2,"Only way to get classic ""Don't Tell Me""","Since it's unavailable on most services, this album remains one of the few ways to get the classic song ""Don't Tell Me"". You pay for all the extra songs. Best to buy this used, get it in your iTunes, and ditch the CD."
2,"Beautiful pictures, terrible paper","The pictures on these tarot cards are truly beautiful. The paper they are printed on is a joke, an embarrassment. I wanted to actually ""use"" this deck, to shuffle and deal the cards. Unfortunately they have no substance and no finish and are impossible to consider using for an actual reading as they readily bend and crease. This is so sad as the pictures are magnificent and could be very inspirational in a reading."
1,turn off the tv,Don't join Mr. Brown and his family for another season of cooning and family foolishness. I don't like this show and the first 5 seasons and hope there is not a 6th. Fans should should grow up.
2,I Guess You Had to Be There,"I am a fan of weird cult and experimental films but El Topo becomes tedious after a while. It was one of the original ""midnight movies"" and probably worked better in that setting. El Topo (more interesting for its imagery than plot) comes off as a stoned, somewhat campy film highly derivative of Luis Bunuel, Arrabel (Viva La Muerte) and is similar to the early experimental films of Werner Herzog (Even Dwarves Started Small, Fata Morgana). That said if you've heard of all these films and are in the mood for a surrealistic, sacreligious western that drags on for a long time, then El Topo has its moments."
3,Another Alan Bennett delight.,"I was very pleased with this collection of short stories. Alan Bennett is a delightful and thoughtful writer who pushes the limits of cultural comfort levels with his writing. Although I wasn't quite as enamored with these stories as I have been in the past with ""History Boys"" and ""The Uncommon Reader,"" I was far from disappointed. If you are already a Bennett fan in search of new material I highly recommend picking this up. If you are new to Bennett and looking for an introduction to his work I highly recommend putting this one on your shelf... but read it *after* ""The Uncommon Reader."""
5,Addicting,The sims 2 on xbox is one of the best games I have ever played. You have the ability to control your sims every move. This game is very addicting and provides many hours of fun and enjoyment. The sims 2 on xbox is good for people that don't have a powerful enough to play the pc version. However the xbox game does not include the ability for your sims to age. But it is still a very fun game and it provides many hours of fun.
2,lines did not line up,The lines on the globe did not line up. I kept it because I home school and my grandson was so thrilled with it.
4,"A good unit, but a little slow on the uptake","When in operation, the eTrex Summit is a great unit. Once locked on, it holds signals well, and the data screens are intuitive and easy to navigate through. Map detail on the included basemap is pretty good, although exit data is a little odd (sometimes it will refuse to give you data for a road you are on, or give you the exits for an adjacent road). As a hiker's unit, it's good to know you can still get a bearing with the digital compass and know your approximate ascent rate with the barometer even without a clear sky view.Now, the downside. Locking in is sometimes tediously slow, both on foot or in the vehicle. An external antenna would help, but there is no provision for one, and keeping the unit properly orineted is a bit of a trick. Once locked in, though, it is not much of a problem.All in all, I am very satisfied with this unit."
4,Did exactly what we needed,"This product did exactly what we needed and provided the data that we needed. Be prepared to click around a lot. Options are not as obvious as other GPS units, but the satellite view while streaming data to the computer were exactly the features we needed."
5,It works!!!,"I've been from Canada to Wyoming, walking the ground and in the air. The Vista is the best. From loading maps, to tracking and trips, it works like a champ."
2,Like being onboard Starship Enterprise *when it works*,"This incredible gadget has so many features it makes you feel like you're a member of the Enterprise crew. It also has enough menus and screens to leave even hardcore electronic gadget junkie satisfied. Yet, it has one shortcoming - it doesn't work half the time under real life conditions. Perhaps if you are in an open desert or a similar terrain it is reliable, but even with light tree cover (20-25%) or hills nearby it sadly reports ""weak signal"" and cannot calculate your position. To me, all the other features are an icing on the cake, but without being able to fulfill its primary mission, it becomes but an expensive electronic paperweight."
2,How about the reception?,"Just used my new Vista for the first time this weekend in the Rockies, where you can easily need a working/accurate GPS.The system gave me weak signal notes almost all weekend. I was just a mile or two off HWY 24? Not many trees. Even lower quality further in the mountains just west of Pikes Peak? Ok, I have been around, I will try to figure if it is me, but I have used GPS before and this does not seem right.Luckily, I always terrain navigate with 1:24K maps I produce from Natl Geo, so a non-functioning GPS is not a big deal, just thought it could help. Hey, maybe I do not need a GPS?? For about $0.40 I can print my own maps."
5,Great Value for Family Geocaching,"Well priced & worked very well the first two times we used it. Easy to figure out, even my kids used it."
1,The worst unit I have ever used,"I bought this unit a couple of years ago based on its features, but soon discovered that it can't normally do the one thing that all GPSs should, tell you where you are. I used my e-Trex Vista for about a year and half and would estimate that I spent 10% to 15% of the time staring at some type of lost signal message. The unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days, which means about half the time in the Seattle area where I live. I would not recommend this unit to anyone but my worst enemy."
5,data transfer ( from MapSource ),"Somebody seems to have written that it took more than an hour to download data from MapSource to etrexLegend ( 8MB ), but I have successfully transferred various areas from MapSource to etrexVista ( 24MB ) and it took only 50 minutes. It is really a nice GPS in my hand !"
1,Bad,"It turned on great but took about twenty mins to find anything. then when it did i had me about 2 miles from town. i was in the middle of town, not two miles. Not happy :("
3,I does what I needed it for,The eTrex was picked based on cost. My work changed in a way that it required that a gps receiver. Only need it to mark and record latitude and longitude. It was easy to use and the manual was understandable.
3,same book 2 titles!,"This is one of those annoying cases where one book (otherwise known as Keep it Simple Stupid) is issued under 2 titles and the unwary purchaser can end up with the same book twice.But in book terms this is a very readable little work covering all sorts of family issues. In each scenario the 2 protagonists (husband & wife, mother & teenage child or whatever) each put their case over an issue and Judge Judy delivers her opinion at the end"
4,I sure hope so!,"I adore this woman....and all her books. This one is very good for young people thinking about doing something financially stupid in a relationship...Team Judge Judy up with Dr. Laura for Vice President and America has a winning ticket! Go, ""girls""!"
3,smarter than you look,I read several of Judy's books. This one was probably to make money. It was a synopsis of several cases. Since I watch them every day it was kind of a repeat.
2,"Took a chance on a low price, still disappointed.","I thought I'd give it a shot for the price. Since I'd been to the Badlands with a group of friends on my way to Montana, I wanted my parents to be able to see their beauty in HD. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the footage or the content represented. It just felt a bar below professional."
4,Beautifully informative!,"Great footage paired with an in-depth look at the subject matter makes this blu ray a hit. However, does not have quite the polish of a big studio docudrama (...think 'Life') and is dry in some spots where alot of factual info is presented. With the amount of footage that is on this Blu ray- still a great buy!"
2,woa wait a minute. these guys are like dave matthews?,"more like some sorta ska band that went a little country maybe? yea i can hear the dave matthews ring to em in the beginning of the song, but these guys dont really jam or are nearly as talented as dave matthews. good thing i didnt buy the cd."
5,Speechless,"The Wanderer provides words for that feeling of being speechless. Combining a pleasing and talented instrumental base with the story of the man making sense of his thoughts, OAR was able to connect with all of those things that I have left unsaid and bring them to light. This is an amazing album composed by an extremely talented group. Purer than the other two albums, The Wanderer feeds off of emotion."
5,THis cd rocks,"If you like punk rock, mixed with great guitar, this cd is for you. They also have some great ska mixed in. Buy this cd! you will not be dissapointed."
3,Hanes Authentic Tagless Tee,I was looking for a heavier weight t-shirt. This one is okay. Quality is fine. Washes well. BUT I was looking for a T-shirt of the same weight as the Pluma T-shirts Sam's Club used to sell.
3,A Boyfriend for Christmas,"A little hokey, but definitely nice to see that romance is not a lost art!"
5,Sometimes You Get What You Wish For...,"I watch all the Christmas movies during the holidays. Some are bad, some so-so, some really good. This one falls into the latter category. Good story that keeps you smiling and interested, and a very good cast that makes the slowly developing romance believable and not contrived. It has serious moments, and goofy moments...just as a good Christmas movie should. Try it. You'll like it."
5,Love this movie,I couldn't find this movie on TV this year so I found it on Amazon and glad I ordered it.
4,The music embraces you,"I am an avid searcher of the finer music of life.. and whilst John does not fall into the most amazing music i have heard, he certainly takes you somewhere. The music embraces you and doesn't let you go.. and for this I give him 5 stars. It is truly a mature effort. I think it displays great maturity in understanding and theme. He gets this one.You will definitely find a place for this particular CD in your collection."
5,John Tesh is an anoited musician!,"One World is jammed packed with the most incredible music I have ever heard in my life. I can feel the power in the music as it reaches into the depths of my spirit. I was especially blessed by the song done with Point of Grace, Who Am I? It isn't very often that you find an album in which you like every single song on it. Well every song on this album is spectacular and everyone should get a hold of this album."
3,Mostly new age jazzy sound,"To call this One World was stretching. The music has mostly a new age jazzy kind of sound - the kind that makes decent movie themes - nothing wrong there. As far as the world, a couple of trendy music styles are included, celtic, Native American, Flaminco, and an oh so sweet Christian Pop tune song but the amazingly unremarkable voices of Point of Grace. All of this is pleasant, but not great stuff and hardly a statement on the univerality of music. The closest he comes to melding the sounds together is in the dramatic title track in which the different ethnic themes are pleasingly woven together. All in all pleasant stuff and worth a listen. I am curious enough to try to hunt down a video from Blockbuster as I suspect it worked better with the dances and scenery."
3,"Cults, an overview","Wonderful overview of the history of cults around America. Cohen seeks to inform! His skeptal approach to the histeria and myths of cults is refreshing. He trys (I think sucessfully) to explain, ""what is a cult?"", ""who joins a cult and why?"". He discusses witchs, satanic cults, mind control and brainwashing. This book was written in easy to understand language, not a book for theologens but for the everyday person hoping to understand the history and psycholocy of cults."
5,Some of the Best I've Heard of Late,"This is one of those albums that is in relatively regular rotation in my stereo. It does for youthful aggression/optimism what Beck's Sea Change did for depression - legitimates it. And it feels good. Once you know the lyrics, or even before you do, you'll be hard pressed to not sing along.A few lyrical highlights stick out in particular, such as the chorus from Relative Ways:""It's OKI'm a SaintI forgaveYour mistakes.""All of the lines are sung with an enthusiasm that seems to transmit that, unlike what so many bands suggest, the existentialist crises that youth face aren't just acceptable -- they're fun."
4,theyre trying to do something new,"Trail of dead. Well, theyre trying to do something new. Unfortunately for them (and us), angst ridden, powerful,angry and desperate music has been invented and reinvented a thousand times. Which doenst leave truly original bands much room to move. Trail of Dead suffer because of this, and this is their only downfall. In an effort to do something new, they stumble around sounding like theyre tring to avoid having a hook, or a catchy line in their songs. Which makes em complicated and messy.But they pull it off. It sounds great. Deep, meaningful, and moody layers of music, that feel like they eminate in chunky layers from your speakers.If youre bored with rock music today, youre going to like this. But dont expect catchy tunes and songs about girls. Put it on loud and really irritate your neighbours..."
3,Just clutters the counter,"I'm a huge fan of kitchen gadgets so I thought I just had to have this for my KitchenAid. My stand mixer stays on the counter top and gets used a few times a week. I hardly ever use the shield though. It was more of a pain to clean and didn't really help keep the mess off the counter. It fits just fine but didn't help too much with the flour poof that coats my counter. I found it was better to turn off the mixer and add the flour, that kept things much neater. I wish I hadn't bought it, waste of money in my kitchen."
1,Great if it fit,I bough the shield and a dough hook via this company and I am sure that both would work great if they fit. I have looked all over the page on both and see no mentioning of size.
1,Shield,The shield does not suit the mixer I bought (classic kitchen aid 4 1/2).It does not specify sizes when you choose it. I thought they were all the same.
2,Meh!,Bought this some time ago and more often than not it just gets placed on the counter while I use my machine.It works but it's messy and just another thing to be washed afterward. Really not worth the bother since I long ago learned to slow my machine down when adding ingredients such as flour that might get thrown out of the bowl. I just use a measuring cup when adding liquids.Far better to just nab a cover for your machine for about the same money.
5,"KN256PS fits 9"" diameter bowl",I ordered the wrong shield for my mixer (8 in. diameter bowl). I thought the dimension would be helpful.
5,No more mess,does exactly what its supposed and helps this messy baker keep things cleaner!you won't be sorry if you get this!
2,I will search for the original edition,"An amateur Church historian, by love but not by training, I looked forward to perusing this compendium of church documents. The editor, Chris Maunder, claims to 'provide the global perspective essential in contemporary church history and theology' -- I read in the forward. Uh-oh. The Table of Contents elaborates on this: ""Black Theology, the Origins of Liberation Theology, The Ordination of Women, Feminist Theology, Ecotheology"" are some of the listings in this new section.If this is what you are looking for, by all means you will find these new ear-tickling theologies explored. I will look for the original edition, written in the early 1960s."
4,I don't even speak spanish...,"I saw the live performance titled ""Blanco y Negro En Vivo"" on PBS a while back and was enthralled. I had to have this amazing music - even though I didn't speak a word of Spanish. Not finding a CD of the performance [but one can purchase the DVD here on Amazon] I bought ""Lagrimas Negras"" instead.The combination of Bebo's experienced piano and Cigala's sexy flamenco vocals makes for an interesting cultural mix. Worldly without being ""World Music"".The recording is clear and cleanly mixed, highlighting the two men's abilities. I was glad to find my favorite song from the live performance ""Bein Paga"" was included on this album. The piano on this track is especially amazing.I have to say that although this is an excellent recording, it pales to the live performance and it's sadly short! Buy this and also buy the DVD!"
2,Stick With Battlefield 1942,I bought this game with the expectations that it would be as fun as battlefield 1942 but with updated graphics. Wrong and Wrong. The graphics are on par with the predecessor and the game is rather annoying. All of the maps are visually the same - jungle after jungle with a few buildings. I have no doubts that in 6 months EA with release a $30 expansion pack because these maps are lacking. In BF 1942 there were major differences from close city combat to desert warfare to island hoping naval battles. The jungle foliage is dense to the point that you keep getting shot and do not know where it is coming from if the person shooting you is crouched or prone. It is not as balanced as BF 1942 with snipers ruling the day as they reload instantly. Spend your money on Battlefield 1942 and buy the Road to Rome expansion pack.
4,invest in a new videocard and memory,"The game is fine it just needs few batches. my advice to invest in a new video card like GForce FX5700 ultra, or ATI 9600XT,and more RAM (512mb)"
1,battlefield vietnam,as a single person shooter this game is a joke compared to vietcong or call of duty this game is going back
4,I like it...,"My system:1.2 Ghz AMD Athlon512 MB RAMGeForce2 64 MB video cardSB 512 sound cardI updated my audio and video drivers and installed the latest version of directx before installing BFV. It installed and runs fine. I've been using the defaults that it selected for my machine, low video settings, 16 bots, etc. The game plays fine and the video is still good at low res (comparable or better than BF1942). I think it's a good game with some good maps. Haven't tried multiplayer yet. The only bug I've seen is the artillery sound loop. you just need to exit the current game and start a new one to fix it (and don't use fixed artillery). I'm sure that will be fixed in a future patch."
3,Well...its good.,"This is an amazing FPS. it has great graphics,and awesome gameplay. But, if you have a computer from when Windows XP just came out it takes at least 7 mins to load a single map. Newer computers can load it faster, but loading still takes a very long time. I tried the online multiplayer. Its not worth it. You wait for it to load, then you play for about 10 or 15 mins, then some more loading, etc. etc."
2,How disappointing!,"I loved BF 1942, and it was with anticipation that I installed this new installment. Much to my dismay, this sequel feels more like an open-source mod than a whole new game. I fail to see the ""great graphics"" that some are talking about (I have a high-end PC/graphics card, thank you very much), and the game is full of bugs. The online aspect has been really buggy so far, with unacceptable lag.My biggest disappointment, however, was with the level design and the overall feel of the game. Whereas the levels in BF1942 (and its expansion packs) were brilliant and really conveyed a sheer sense of epic conflict, the levels here are 1)WAY too dark, 2)Too cramped and 3)Boring. I realize that the battlefields of vietnam were different from WWII, but all the levels end up looking exactly the same: hilly jungle. Far from creating tension, this results in boredom, as you skulk around looking for somebody to frag. All in all, if feels like a cosmetic update to what was a great WWII game."
3,"Great game, but not perfect yet","I do not agree with that, but this is how they get to do to release games: first we have a poor performance version, with some lack of functionality, but three or four months later we get patch 1 and 90% of problems get solved.There are several problems, some within the Options Menu !! How this could not be tested before releasing ??But I don't mind, it's a great game and it will get better and better after each new patch."
4,Very good game!,Better than BF1942. Has a few small bugs left but EA has been patching. Highly recommend!
5,Pretty Good,"The game is pretty good! The graphics are good! They reload realistically and each soldier shows their name. It also shows a list of all the voice commands you can use. If you're looking for a good/fun war game, I would highly recommend this!"
1,"Very poor reception, don't get lost in the woods","I bought this unit to track my path in the woods in Western North Carolina and regrettably the unit will not pick up signal with dense leaves over head, for that matter if there are any leaves over head. When Garin says you need a clear, unobstructed view of sky it really means it. I had to hike till there was a clear unobstructed view of the sky to receive a signal strong enough to find my current location but could not plot my path nor will the unit work in a belt carrying case and hold signal. I tried freash batteries and another unit but same results. The signal is also very weak in the car. It is possible that the mountain ranges were to blame but really! I would not recommend this unit for anyone who will not have a completely unobstructed view of the sky and car roofs seem to matter. The Garmin GPS MAP 75 has a better antenna so I would consider this unit over any of the eTrex units which all use the same antenna. I hope this helps Brian."
3,"Nice, but I would recommend the Vista","I purchased the Legend and after loading maps in it, I found that there simply was not enough memory for my needs. I returned it and purchased the Vista which I like very much."
3,etrex GPS,It appears to be a good item but I have yet to put it through its paces . The only thing I'm not that crazy about is the plug that links the GPS to the computer. It should have been USB or Firewire not a serial type. Also the web site is a bit confusing to find the right type of map for your specific needs.
3,"Good, but could be a lot better","Overall, this is a good unit for the price. Like all electronics, this unit is much better than units I have purchased over the years as competition for features dictate demand. There is plenty of memory in this small unit for waypoints, tracks, and routes. However, the waypoints only contain the basic coordinate information and an icon. It lacks the ability for a date and a comments field! Had I known this in advance of purchase I would have definately not purchased, at any price. As an avid outdoorsman, and past hunting guide of many years I know the value of knowing dates, and adding comments about the marked location. The sceen display is crisp, but only in ideal light conditions. The backlight display is near useless. It's very difficult to see. If you'd like a cost effective gps with a fair amount of memory then this gps might fit your bill, however I'd opt for the Magellan Meridan as my second choice, even though battery life is lower, for the above reasoning."
1,Nearly worthless,"This is a nice compact unit with pretty blue plastic and a lanyard so you can hand it on your neck. That's the end of the positives.The big, really big, negative is that this thing has such poor sensitivity that unless you live in the desert and no bird or plane ever fles over you, you will have problems getting it to work because it will not find satellite signals.OK, mild exageration. I live in mid-Michigan and it actually has found enough satelites to work if there was nothing above it. However, the moment you go under a tree, any tree, you will lose your signal and you will not get it back until you move out from under the tree. I think that if you put your hand over the Etrex Legend you will lose your signal.This thing is well named because a legend is often a myth and not based on fact. It is certainly a myth that the Etrex Legend is a useable GPS.Garmin should be deeply ashamed for selling such junk."
1,False Advertising -- NOT WAAS compatible,"This product is consistently being advertised as having a high degree of accuracy because it is WAAS-compatible.It is not.Quite some time ago, the WAAS satellite protocol was changed. Garmin has not updated the firmware for the etrex Legend, and since that time, having WAAS compatibility enabled will cause this unit to lock up after 15-40 minutes of usage. This information is directly from Garmin tech support.Since the change occurred quite some time ago, and it is a relatively simple fix, I can only conclude that Garmin has no intent of upgrading this product.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT WAAS-LEVEL ACCURACY. ADVERTISING THIS PRODUCT AS BEING WAAS-COMPATIBLE IS FALSE AND MISLEADING."
4,Excellent for Geocaching!,I bought this item for [...] and it works great! It's accuracy can be off by 10-60 feet (depending on where you are) but it gets me close enough to the spot I want to be at!
5,Great Handheld GPS,Excelent Handheld GPS. Easy to follow menu and options.I use mine for Navigating / Boating Biscayne Bay Miami Florida.[GARMIN BISCAYNE BAY GPS MAP SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD] availble at:http://gps.cyberpine.com
2,No USB or power cable,"When I opened it I foud it had a serial port connection. Unfortunately my laptop was not built in 1991 so it only had USB ports. Garmin will sell you an adapter, for $60."
4,Good value for the money...,"After getting lost for the first and the last time I decided to invest in the GPS. Garmin Legend seemed like a good piece due to possible upgrades (8 megs of space), price and having a lot of maps build in. I use it both on the water and land. So far it is doing fine being as accurate as it can be. If you are a kayaker like me you will really love the speed/distance measurements... You can use this GPS to track your way around or set most crucial spots (like bay entry or camp site) as your way point and than when you coming back just set the unit to lead you there. Most of the landing points are marked already with the included software. Unit feels very fragile, my window was scratched after few minutes in my pocket , I really hate using it with my left hand (plus what's up with the color!) and 5 minutes start up time is also it's weak point. But at the end Legend gets the job done."
3,$125.00 base service fee?!#$,"I was very happy with my garmin etrex legend, for about a year. I used it offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, in the bayous of Louisiana, Texas, etc.It was perfect for hiking, and especially geocaching. Then the screen started acting up- first it got a bunch of vertical lines, then just started blanking out completely. I emailed garmin, since their customer testimonial page RAVED about customer support- explained the problem in detail, then waited, waited waited. Finally I was told to reboot it(hard Reset) or reload the software. I emailed again, again explained that it was a hardware problem, not a software problem. Was told to send it in for a fee of $125. I ONLY PAID $136.00 TO BEGIN WITH!!!so, long story short, save your money for a higher end gps if you cant afford a disposable unit."
1,Obsolete in 2011,"This shouldn't even be for sale in 2011. It's 8MB memory is too small for the new Garmin software. Unless you can find the old Garmin software, you should pass on this. Even then, it is grossly overpriced for 2011."
1,Not good under tree cover,I bought this unit for Geocaching. I have grown tired and frustrated of losing satellite signal under any sort of tree cover. We are finally decided to sell it for a better unit.
4,Very pleased,I purchased this unit as a gift for a male friend. He really liked it and was excited about using it. He loves it and says it's very accurate for use around his home area. I don't have specific details about the specs on this item but I can report that it was a well liked/used gift.
4,Geocaching with eTrex Legend,"We have been geocaching 9 months now now with our Legend, and have had no troubles at all. Accuracy has been great, down to 3 feet, in some instances. Battery life is as advertised or better. The unit holds up well to minor tumbles and everyday abuse with out a scratch. Our only complaint is the size of the display, wished it was a little bigger. A great entry level unit, would buy another."
2,A very narrow Male dominated movie,"Comparing the theme and story to Revolutionary Road would be unfair to Man in the Gray Flannel. Because even though both ponder the role of man in modern society, Revolutionary Road has two things that Gray Flannel doesn't: actual conflict (not just existential BS) and a sentient wife character.Gregory Peck's acting is wooden, and his character never actually develops or reacts to the changes around him. The movie is also too long. I have never seen more unnecessarily long scenes about his time at war."
1,Chopper doesn't chop,"Purchased this product as a lowcost onion chopper. Unfortunately, it doesn't chop. Might possibly work weith something softer but doesn't work with onions."
4,Pretty Good and Interesting,"I have never been a country music fan. I do remember the news about Natalie Maine's statement but after that I didn't follow it at all.Now, after watching this documentary, I didn't realize just how ""crazy"" things managed to happen in the country music world and how corporate America has a way of trying to sabotage things. Wonder what the response would have been if a country male artist had made such a statement.What I like about the DCs is that they are real and are talented muscians which is evident throughout this film. It is interesting to watch what goes into writing and producing songs. It was quiet candid and I am sure difficult to allow viewers into their family life.As for Rick Rubin, I have heard alot about him because he produces such a variety of artists. I didn't quiet picture his look though. That was surprising."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this DVD. I'm not a huge country music listener, but the guts these girls showed (whatever your politics are) makes me a fan. For any person who doesn't really understand the business of politics, watch this movie. It's definitely political econ 101."
5,A Sold-out Music Play in 1976,"""Falso Brilhante"" was a sold-out music play by Elis Regina. A wide cover of Brazilian and Latin music of the moment. ""Gracias a La Vida"" and ""Los Hermanos"" are sung in their original Spanish. Elis also covers some of the new important composers from those times, namely Belchior. The ensemble is the usual one for Elis at those times, with the usually great arrangements by Cesar Camargo Mariano. Here you'll find Elis Regina in all her splendor. This is a studio (not live) album although it gets nearly all the repertoire from the show. Strangely, one of the best Elis' renditions from the show was not recorded in the studio, the song ""No Dia em Que Vim-me Embora"" by Caetano Veloso."
3,Feels a bit self-indulgent,"Judging by the praise heaped on by the other reviews, I obviously didn't like this book as much as most people. I read Berg's more recent ""Open House"" first, and I enjoyed the sunny writing style and humor. For me, however, ""Talk"" bogged down somewhere in the middle. With the exception of Ruth, who is dying of cancer, most of the women seemed to be sketchily drawn. The narrator, with whom we are meant to empathize, is similarly sketchy. One questions, too, how easily she seems to balance her home life with caring for her dying friend.Despite the adulation, this book just isn't up to par with ""Open House."" The subject is compelling, and Ruth is somewhat compelling as a character, but the book is too long and too sketchy to be compelling as a whole."
1,Order cancelled without explanation,"Allergy Be Gone sent one note a couple of weeks late saying they were having trouble getting this in. A couple of weeks later I received a note from Amazon that the order had been cancelled. So, although I'd love to review this fan, I was disappointed by the vendor. Current product listing on Amazon shows ""one left in stock"". Frustrating..."
1,NYDM? More like NMOTG- no more of this garbage!,"This band is a joke band from New York pretending to be some kind of death metal, when in reality it's just really bad tough-guy hardcore/nu-metal played by jocks who secretly listen to HATEBREED, KORN, and LIMP BISCUIT. ""Get in da pit, ya'll"". What a joke... I'm embarassed to live in a state with such awful bands that make a joke out of metal."
4,Evolution baby!,"I discovered Skinless two years ago on Relapse.com and time passed before i actually like their music.Extremely funny lyrics and groovy grinding guitars,that band blew off my plugholes for my own pleasure.I've only been playing it 3 or 4 times for the time being but i can guarantee you it's definitely delicious Death! One word to define it would be ""evolution""! Can you believe it? The man sings on this record!! Yeah,melodic vocal parts mingle with the usual grunting roars.The result is just fine!PLus,their music got more complexed but as efficient as in the past.All in all:a great attempt at blazing new trails in Death-metal scenery."
4,great use of language and an enjoyable read,"old story of growing up as a first generation immigrant with a new twist. excellent use of language and a fun read. the only negative is that i got very frustrated with donna, but maybe i was supposed to. i also found the ending somewhat contrived but still worth the read."
4,Overall a good book,"This book was slow in some parts, but overall a good read. I definitely wanted to find out why's and how's at the end of the book."
3,Can you say LOOOOONNNG Sentences?,"I've just begun this book, but I find the author's use of long sentences (sometimes a page long), difficult to read. It's easy to forget her point.So far, the story is interesting, especially if you're Polish or live in Connecticut/Mass area. You will mostly likely find references to towns nearby or remember Polish words/phrases from your childhood. I may end up loving this book, but the writing style is difficult to read."
5,I sent out SEVEN copies of this book!!Did YOU get one?,"When I read this book back in 1996,I liked it SO much,I purchased SEVEN copies and put a note in the frontis(sp?) page telling that the one who received this book he or she HAD to give it to someone else to read...I have NEVER received the books back(and YES,my name and address WAS in each) so it is my HOPE that those books have since traveled the world..I ALSO contacted OPRAH""S book club about choosing this book to read........it needs MORE publicity..but i DO believe I've done MY part!!"
1,Broken Item,I received this item in a damaged state. The 4th disc was literally cut in half. I have gotten no response from the sellers as to whether they will reimburse me or not. Not satisfied at all.
5,YIPPY! It's about time!!!,"I have LOVED Macgyver for years, and was not-so-patiently waiting for it to come out on DVD. I'm thrilled to be able to watch on DVD, instead of my ten year old vcr tapes. I'm thrilled that the PTB finally granted our wish to have this wonderful program on DVD. My only disappointments are that it's only available in Full Screen, and there are NO special features. I hope in future season releases they add interviews with some of the recurring characters like Penny Parker(Teri Hatcher) and Murdoc(Michael des Barres)."
5,The BEST show EVER!,"I don't know why everyone is complaining about the quality and no special features.The reason they call them special features is because they are special and they aren't always there. I just think it is the best show ever.I have watched every show over and over again.I still love each one the same that I did the first day I got it!Who wouldn't?!I don't think that the picture is grainy or poor at all,I love it!I am going to preorder the second season as soon as possible!I hope that Paramount comes out with the rest of the seasons!I certainly got my $30 worth!"
4,MacGyver the magnificent on a meager DVD,"I tend to agree with most reviewers on the MacGyver DVD. I grew up watching the show during its run on Network Television. I yearned each week for the next great adventure. But, the DVD's are lacking. Nothing is included with the episodic content. Nothing adds to the value of the series. In this day and age of special features, director's commentaries, and Easter Eggs galore, the makers of the MacGyver DVD have failed.Lucky for them the show's greatness bulks their rating to 4 stars. This is still MacGyver in his earliest adventures. This is MacGyver pre-Phoenix foundation. This is still a joy to watch."
4,MacGyver rules!,"I just wanna say that bad acting and easy plots etc. is what makes MacGyver so great! The badguys are stereotypes, the girls are stereotypes and the story is kinda obvious. But thats what makes it so fun too watch. You gotta watch the show with a sence of irony, not critisisme. Then you can sit back and enjoy the action and adventures!But I do miss some interviews or comentary tracks!"
5,How to defeat alien invaders using common household items!,I just started watching this show again. I love it and so does my daughter. This is a great show a cross between James Bond and Mr. Wizard. Very little blood and gore; just really intelligent ideas.There handiwork of Terry Nation is all over it. The man who invented the Daleks and Blake's 7. I had the pleasure of meeting him in person. Anderson does a perfect job portraying the character. I am not sure who is he supposed to work for. No matter who cares probably the same people as Mission Impossible :-)The stories are really intelligent. Makes you realize a bit of cleverness goes a long way. Great deal of fun and at this price how could you go wrong?
5,Toscanini is the star,"One of the early NBC telecasts from 1948, this primitive video shows Toscanini (The Maestro) in much of his glory. Whether or not you like his way with Beethoven is what your opinion will rest on. The ancient sound and the crude picture will not lure you in but if you can get past that, there is much here to see and enjoy. Toscanini is known as a brisk, no nonsense conductor. He does, however, in this performance, allow the music's slower passages to breath. The soloists, except for Norman Scott, are little known but all acquit themselves very well, under Toscanini's eye and baton. Robert Shaw, at the beginning of his career, conducts the well-trained chorus in the final movement. A mainly historic document but much to study and enjoy."
3,Didn't read instructions,"The young lady that wrote the first review was incorrect. You can use it on your face and nose. In order to use it for your face, you have to turn the plastic suction piece around. It is reversible. Its an effective product."
5,Don't let the sceptics deceive you...,"I found this product to be quite effective. I have been having chronic problems with my skin since I returned from Iraq. I have tried various cleansers and astringents to try to clear up my breakouts. When I bought this product I had a few pimples and white heads that I made previous attempts at popping but they either scarred my face or did not go away and were painful and swollen the next day. When I used the Panasonic Pore Cleanser I could see it working on the areas. The next day the pain was gone, the pimple was gone, and all that remained was a tiny scab. As for the negative reviews they must have tried to use it with the mist only. Just make sure you wash your face first and then while it's still wet use the pore cleanser and immediately following use an astringent. This product work wonders for me...."
2,Not Enough Suction,"A cute little device, it just doesn't have enough suction to get anything out of my skin."
1,Panasonic non-Cleaner!,"This product does not work. Whomever posted that initial review as to how great is probably works for the company. It has no suction really, and the mist is really a little water dripping out every so often. It's not at all worth the money, acutally I wouldn't take it if they were giving it away. Don't waste your money."
5,Must have it,"I tried this Panasonic Pore Cleanser a while ago, and I found it works! Now I need it wherever I go. I just love it."
4,keeping it clean,i really like the panasonic pore cleanser...i use it daily. it does help me to keep my hands off my face....it also helps to remove the dead and dry skin. I would have given it a 5 but it does not stay charged as long as i would like it too...and i wish it had an extra tip.
2,Panasonic Pore Cleaner????????,I have had this product for about a year now. And it worked great until about 6 months ago. The part of the pore cleaner that sprays a mist of water quit working. It didnot come with very good instructions or very good tools for cleaning the product. It still works but not as well. I wouldnt recommend buying this product. Sorry.
2,too good to be true,"This product does not work at all. If something seems to good to be true, it usually is."
2,doesn't work!,"honestly, I have a lot of blackheads on my nose.. its starting to really bother me therefore, I purchased this pore cleanser. OK, this product doesn't take out my blackheads. It does open up my pore and make it easier for me to use a stainless steel blackhead remover to scrub off my blackheads but this suction doesn't remove the blackheads. That is why I think its a total waste of money. Let me suggest you all to take a facial steam for 5-10 minutes and then use a metal (professional blackhead remover) and start to scrub off the blackheads. That works much better."
4,Review of Pore Cleanser,"I love it. However, I wish that the suction was a little stronger. The misting part is a little messy."
1,Suck-tion,"Even when the pours are open (just out of the shower) the suction is only enough to leave red marks on the skin. If the Pour cleanser had more focused suction, it might actually clean the pours out."
3,Is it helping?,"I bought this in hopes it would help clear up my slightly aging, and definately blemished skin. As it costs as much as one facial I thought it might be a good investment in clear skin. I haven't seen any improvement in my skin so I'm still thinking about trying a short series of facials."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"Whether you are just starting your Elvis kick, or you have an A in Elvis-ology, this book is a must have. The photographs are beautiful and the writing is a breath of fresh air- putting you right in the heart of Memphis... and Elvis. You won't find tall tales, gossip, or dirt on Elvis here, just many reminders of why we love the man so much. The style of writing is musical and fresh and it is a delight to read."
4,Rosario Tijeras,Atrapa! La empiezas a leer y no puedes dejarla. Una visión realista y contundente. Evidencia los problemas de carácter dentro de nuestra sociedad
5,"too ""BAD"" it's out of print--and that it wasn't FOUR discs!!!","This truly is a treasure to find on CD. So many rare remixes and B-sides from both BAD incarnation's 12"" vinyl singles are here. But, at the same time, there's SO much left off that could fill another 2 CDs, including the various 12"" mixes of A Party, Just Play Music, C'mon Every Beat Box, Sightsee MC, Much Worse (many of which had more than one remix), plus even more b-sides. Not to mention, neither of these discs is filled to capacity...both running under an hour!!! They should have included at least 3 more remixes on each disc!Perhaps one day we'll get a COMPLETE rareties boxed set or CD-single boxed set."
2,Not as good as these user ratings are giving it,"One of the only other somewhat negative reviews of this album pretty much summed up exactly what I wanted to say. Farewell is the best COX release in years and this follow up feels like it was more of a side-project that Ronny worked on in his basement with his laptop. There are some decent tracks here, but it is marred by 3 or 4 duds at the beginning and towards the end of the album. I've come to realize that if I skip 4 tracks on this album, it sounds much better, like Farewell actually. If this had come out 5-10 years ago when COX were putting out much worse stuff, I would have been happier with this album. But as a follow-up to Farewell, this comes off as a rushed catalog-filler album.I tried to like it as much as Farewell but I just couldn't. And to try and compare it to Medusa is just rediculous. If there hadn't been so many 5 star reviews, I would have given it 3 stars, but I felt obligated to balance things out a bit."
5,the Sound track to Rushmore is a breath of fresh air.,"Certainly if the kind of class in which the makers of the film Rushmore was ubiquistis, we would all have more soundtracks in our collections. I for one thought it has class, soul, and a perfect match of tunes for this very original film."
5,Unmatched,"This highly anticipated 4 disc opus 'Mystic Chords' never promised to re-invent the genre, rather he focuses on what makes his own style the best of the pack. Roach all but pioneered the heavy synth reverb drenched sound like the ocean tide that ebbs and flows gently that so many try to emulate and this disc is the prime example why he is the best. No one else can make this kind of music this good, period. The blissful synthscapes contained herein are beyond describing in words. And most certainly not 'new age', this is soul music for troubled times when everything is so 'in your face' , this music offers a chance for the listener to suspend themselves away from the world and enter the portal that Roach opens. And it's a good place to be!"
3,"Rushed rendition, strange guitar dance","This is my third Dido and Aeneas recording, and I was struck by how rushed some of the parts are, in particular Belinda's parts. It turns out that this recording is 52:54 long, against EMI's 58:33, for instance. Another disturbing element of this recording is the guitar dance at the end of the first act, which threatens to turn into a Paco de Lucia flamenco.I do find the chorus in this recording stronger and more nuanced than any other I have heard. I also think the Sorceress is just fine without the usual distortion prescribed for the part."
2,Effortless Inertia for Two!,"This is a film with no real grounding. The plot is circular and lightweght. Of the two main characters, one is rather unpleasant, the other simply off-putting. One is a psychological bully who successfully intimidates the other every chance he gets: the other guy is compulsively wimpy and feeds readily into the co-dependent shenanigans that comprise the whole movie. These two, by the way, have been ""friends"" for at least ten years or more. This movie is watchable--but only just."
4,Purchase depends on scope of aspiration,"Any person who considers spending an entire day away from work in the kitchen would enjoy this book; as well, anyone who could blow a Sunday on the couch reading about food would dig this book. After having trained under a fanatical CIA grad, I can attest that the techniques presented seem a parallel representation of this chef's slant. My only gripe is that this book should be all technique, with recipies supporting the ideas only. All in all, worth the discounted price here at Amazon. If you have never cooked in a live kitchen but wish you had, study the technique offered in this book and use the recipies as a learning aid."
5,"great condition, fast shipping","awesome all the way around. Book in better condition than described, received quickly. Look forward to doing business again"
1,Cheap low strength screws,"These screws are very very low quality. I tried to lay Advantech subflooring with them and at least 50 percent or more broke in the first two sheets. The head of the screw would just pop off. After that I gave up on these and got some Phillips decking screws. Not a single one of those broke for the remaining 16 sheets of subfloor, both were #8 screws. I would not want to put my company name on these screws."
3,This release.....,"To the best of my knowledge, Johnny's widow, Barbara, had ZERO input on this release. She gets an annual check from BMI in the $450 range for airplay, but ZERO from his recordings."
5,just fine,"purchased for a gift, and was loved by the reciever. the art work is beautiful, and the story line was perfect for the individual."
1,"Well, they got it half right...","Unfortunately, the globe we received had the same map printed on both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We expected a globe of the moon to have two distinct hemispheres, not the same one flipped and repeated."
1,Cheap Quality,I was completely disappointed with this globe. It was a total rip off for the price. It looked like it had been made by kindergartner. It was not nearly as nice looking as the picture posted on amazon. The stand was a really cheap looking plastic and the globe itself was a joke.
2,What?,"This album is some garbage and such a rip-off. How 'bout the group Blaque recorded ""Can't Get it Back"" years ago. They are okay as far as harmonization, but the vocals are weak. They do overuse beats, as someone stated earlier. I recommend not buying it at all."
5,Nothing special,The Gold set is nothing to look at. Nintendo just makes a gold color as a way to make money. Gold is expensive and a gold color ninendo system just makes the price more expensive. Buy the regular black nintendo 64 console and save the hassle of the gold coming off while playing. If sweat does get on it the gold starts to come off which makes your controller look bad.
5,An truly inspiring story,"My husband and I picked up a stack of CD's to listen to on a long car trip. Levi's Will had ""Inspirational Fiction"" on it so we thought it might not be too bad. We were immediately drawn in by the story and couldn't wait to get back to it each time stopped. Dale is an excellent writer, and the story was indeed inspirational. I was so impressed with his writing that I bought all of his other books. I thought they would be a great addition for our church library.Sorry to say, I have been disappointed. It seems to me he did not intend for women to read Bad Ground. As I read it, I kept thinking that my husband would really enjoy this story, but I felt I was intruding in a man's world. I haven't been able to finish Sutter's Cross. It started out pretty interesting, but it became obvious what was going to happen in the end. It just didn't hold my interest.I will never forget the story of Levi's Will."
1,Never Received,"I ordered this product over a month ago and I never got it, how am I supposed to review an item I paid for and never received? Thanks for NOT providing me with what I wanted AND taking my money"
2,Fully Progamable Controls ? Don't think so.,"First, we have been using pressure cookers on a regular basis , for 20+ years. They are great, but you need to be able to trust that the are going to work correctly.I received this item without any documentation. Still, I filled it up with water and plugged it in. First thing I noticed was that the electrical connection seemed exposed and not of a very robust design. I then progammed the cooker. That is selected the number of min to have the heat on; and pushed the start button. A light flashed, but nothing else happened. Then the timer began to count down towards zero. I moved the pot back and forth a little. Jiggling the pot must have improved the electrical contact, because pretty soon you could hear the water heating. After the set time of 5 min, the sound stopped. That's it. No control of the temperature at all, other than ""ON"" / ""OFF""Nice Idea for a multi purpose cooker, but not worth the price."
5,A very nice book with many color samples. A stamper's must.,This book contains many color samples highlighting various techniques. I've been stamping for a year and was able to put to use several new ideas from this single book. I recently purchased six stamping books and this one was by far the best.
1,IF ONLY THERE WERE AN OPTION FOR NO STARS!!!,"Not only is this cd tired, but it is a good example of what happens when recycled French pop goes bad. Perhaps Ms. March, or rather Ms. Blake, should realize that she is far too long in the tooth to try and sound like a French ye-ye girl. Ms. Gall and Ms. Hardy did it first, and they did it BETTER!!! Grow Up Sweety."
1,"If you are looking for a French Pop sound, look further...","This record has some fine music. But the singing is artificially nasally and off-key most of the time. It's difficult to sing in a foreign language, and this singer just can't pull it off and drives the listener to distraction or irritation."
4,Not bad for edited version,"I got this for a friend who had seen it on TV originally. Although the quality of the video was good enough, he said there were scenes in the TV version that were apparently cut from this DVD. On the whole, however, it was well worth the price, and the first version may not exist anymore."
2,My kitten won't let me brush her with it,"My kitty has a problem with it and does not like being brushed with it. On the rare occasions that I have been able to get her to use it, it does make her fur softer and less tangled. It has a comfortable handle but the bristles might be too rough for her. Next time I would buy something she is more comfortable with."
4,Hilarious,"I read this book for a book report in my senior English class. It was hard to put down. I found myself reading it every free second I had. I saw myself in a lot of the same situations that ""Retch"" faced. The stories were comical and they kept me laughing throughout the book. If you are looking for something fun to read, pick up this book."
4,Great Soccer Learning Tool,"(I have the VHS version) This video is great, I highly recommend it. They keep it light and fun. John Harkes and Mia Hamm are great teachers, and Home Improvement's Zachary Ty Bryan receives their instruction. They talk about defense and offense. Some real footage of pro teams, some computer graphics, sometimes John, Mia and/or others demo the moves for you. The whole thing is done in kind of like an outline form - and what's nice is, throughout the video from time-to-time they review everything covered so far. So, go buy this great video it will help you learn soccer basics with John and Mia!"
5,Meaningful Life,"A tremendous body of work, both illuminating and thought provoking. Rabbi Jacobson delivers a profoundly deep and purposeful manual for meaningful existence in a cogent, easy to read package. I recommend it wholeheartedly to persons of all religious backgrounds."
4,Steering Wheel Cover,Husband received it as a gift! He just loves it! He has it in his truck in use as we speak!
3,decent product for the price,"i have a 2013 nissan juke sl and the steering wheel is standard size i guess and it was really tough and took some elbow grease to get on. The fabric where the logo is and the bottom part has the same material and feels a bit cheaply made, but serves its purpose. I wish i would have gone with the little more expensive leather one, but..will stick with this one for a while. Not a bad product, but i have a leather wrapped steering wheel and will be getting the leather one next."
5,24 Hour Review,"I bought these to replace my 7 year old pair of Sony MDR-V700. I knew going into this purchase these headphones would not have the bass kick of the MDR-V700. However the spectrum of sound reproduce by the Audio-Technica ATH-A55 is hands down better. Far more balanced then the Sony pair not to mention superior in comfort.If you are looking for a super heavy bass pair of headphones get the Sony, but be warned my pair lasted much longer then the average pair. Mine ultimately broke at the swivel hinge and most seem to break within 2 years.My only complaint so far actually how high of a range these headphones can reproduce. The frequencies are produced with almost no tin which is great but my ears are super sensitive. Seeing as how I wore the Sony pair for 7 years and never had this issue just shows the lack of frequency range of the Sony.A great entry/mid level for the price for a training audiophile."
2,ATH-A55,"After reading many reviews about these headphones I thought it would be worth it. When I first tried them on they were comfortable, but the sound was not that impressive. Everyone talks about the ""Bass"" on these things like it was one of the best, they are WRONG. I had some Sony MDR v700's and the bass on those are better. These headphones sound like they put $15 earbuds inside a some padding. I was very disappointed at the sound quality and am now regreting selling my Sony MDR v700's. These heaphones worth this price, if they were $30 then it would be a good deal."
1,Non-working pirated copy received.....?,"I received this in a timely manner but it turned out to be what I believe to be an unauthorized copy.... going by the packaging and the printing on the disk itself. Disc did not work from the start, had a dull abraded look to it. Not scratched, apparently unused, but just a very dull finish. I washed it-- no help. I polished it and that helped some but it never did work. Seller did not respond to my Email. I sent the disk back within a few days asking for a refund or replacement and nothing. Lost my money on this one!"
4,Worked great for caramels,"The wraps were a good size. A few ripped when I was twisting the ends. Regular waxed paper worked just as well, but it was nice to have the wrappers pre-cut. I would use them again."
1,Shipping is exorbitant,"Haven't even received this item yet so don't know how happy I will be with it. But when shipping costs 3 times the product price, that is ridiculous."
3,Landscaping,Good product but kinda hard to use. It took me awhile to get the hang of how it works but I'm having fun now. Recommend it but be prepared for a little work in figuring out how to make it work.
5,Learning the language of birds...,"A wonderful journey shared by Mr. Martin... his personal story and guide to loving, caring for, and befriending birds. Much more than hand-taming. Stepping beyond backyard feeding, you become intimate with birds, and are invited to move among their world."
1,"The book didn't work for me, I don't recommend it.","This book is just a waste of money. It didn't seem to work, and, SOME OF THE STEPS MADE MY BIRDS FLY AWAY AND NOT COME BACK! I don't recommend this book to anyone!"
5,Fabulous!,"This version is much better then the origional one! Some of the attacks changed and they look better! Moonlight is one of the best looking attacks in the game. Pokemon Stadium is a great game for pokemon lovers, or even if you dont know what pokemon is! Its easy to understand and play. Tons of new mini games, and now they even have Pokemon trivia. You can play games for coins, that you can use in your pokemon for game boys! (At the casin.) I would reccomend this game to everyone!"
1,Horrible,"I am a big fan of Pokemon. I think it's really kool, so my cousin had this game. I played it. It really sucked! All you do is press an attack and you can see it happen. thats like it! Its just like gameboy fighting. i recommend you not buying this game. trust me!"
1,"terrible taste, can't gag it down","Maybe this would be fine in a smoothing/disguised with lots of other things, but mixed with just water it is terrible. It has a foamy consistency. I can barely gag is down. I have tried 3 different protein powders and this is by far the worse tasting. Can't wait to get rid of it."
2,Disgusting flavor: too much artificial sweetener,"It is a Protein mix, that much is true. To describe the flavor as chocolate is a stretch; if chocolate tasted this bad no-one would eat it.This is full of artificial sweetener and the flavor is artificial too. Will never buy it again."
5,Gorgeous...,"I love this necklace! What you see is what you get, it's exactly like the picture. Gorgeous!! It arrived much sooner than expected - a nice surprise. I was thrilled with the purchase, and I'm sure you will be too."
2,Very Tiny !. Don't recommend it.,"This pendant is small, and not worth the price. You may find better deals at malls as you will know what size it is before purchasing it.Don't waste money on it. I am returning it."
2,Disappointed,"I was disppointed in the quality of the pendant. It is flat, not solid, and there is no depth to it. Combine that with its non-dainty size, and it just plain looks cheap. I gave it to my six-year old."
4,Pretty,This necklace was just as it is shown in the picture. It's very pretty and comfortable with a beautiful sparkle. It's so comfortable I slept in it without any irritation. I would recommend this necklace for silver lovers.
5,Sterling silver pave CD heart,This is a very nice looking pendant. It is not very expensive but looks like it could cost 10 Times what it cost. It appears to be of high quality and is durable.
3,Errol Gardner,"disappointed ...I was expecting the more stylized recording of ""Play Misty For Me""......and the general recording sounded flat.however, Gardner was a genius who , today, would be marvelled at."
4,Color Harmony in Your Paintings,I was able to look over the material and I find it very interesting. I am always looking for ways to bring more harmony and balance into my projects and I feel that this information will help me to do that.
2,Color engraving is not color harmony,"The theoretical part of the book is well written and useful for the beginner. But you can find similar descriptions also in other books. The main challenge for an artist is not to mix colors to create a new colour but to combine a lot of colors that looks pleasant. In this book you can find not any hints and examples to combine colors in different ways. The author informs you instead that it is your task to find out the colors you like. Apart from few paintings all paintings looks like the painting on the cover of the book (colorless and with colour engravings, in most cases: brown). The author confuse obviously colour harmony with colour engravings. If I made such pictures with my camera, I would trash them. In case you would like to learn something about colour combinations or get some ideas and inspirations: do not buy this book."
4,molly hatchet flirting with disaster live,one of them that you put in and you have watched over half of it withoutrealizing it.good sound
4,Good Read,As usual Cherry Adair comes through with another good T-flac book. I am enjoying her next one now. Definitely would recommend.
4,Mercenary,I enjoyed this romanctic action mystery. I have read serveral books by Cherry Adair and find her an enjoyable author. My only comment is I wish she wasn't so fond of four letter words.Dottie
5,I think some MC's need to recruit this kat!!,"In an indusry where most MC's beats are sounding the same because of the same wack producers with no taste, Krush seems to drop something unheard of on every track. He brings back what hip-hop is missing and that is an actual ""DJ"" who still cuts, scratch and create while on the turn table. The beats are neck crampin, the samples are on point and the total creativity of his work make this a hip-hop/acid master piece. ""Final Home"" with Esthero is one of my favorite tracks. Her voice over just about anybodys track is a true ear candy to grab. Every track is true work of hip-hop art and should be copped by anyone craving real original beats.oNe"
2,Atlantic City NJ Fire Dept. History,"If you are looking for a book about every historic event in the Atlantic City FD NJ. this is the book for you. The in depth history and events in this book--fantastic.But, if you want photo's of apparatus, helmets, helmet fronts,firemen & badges etc. this is not the book for you. I was hoping for those photo's very few. Also I was looking for large scale photo's of the many 4 to 5 alarm fires that struck Atlantic City 1900 to 1970. Only a very limited few."
4,Great,This series of books was on my mother's wish list and she has just absolutely loved the book and series.
4,"Great pictures, decent capabilities, super price!","If you're a casual photographer looking for a digital camera that takes great-looking photos, the DXG 518 fits the bill. The user interface is pretty simple to operate, and there are some neat built-in features, such as an audio recorder, that expands the camera's versatility. The pictures I've taken all look very sharp and vivid. You can use preset scene options or manually adjust EV, white balance, ISO, and metering to your preference. It even has rudimentary camcorder abilities and can display your photos or movie clips on a television with the included AV cable. The video frame rate is 30 fps and is very smooth in appearance. Maximum resolution for clips is 320x240...good enough for basic purposes. The built-in two-inch screen isn't the sharpest display I've seen, but it does get the job done. All things considered, the DXG 518 is a great value for any casual photographer."
3,OK,"Could have been so much better, didn't really use it at all because it was not what I was looking for."
5,More Brilliance from Ware,"For my money, Chris Ware is one of the outstanding artists of the late 20th/early 21st centuries. His meticulous, bitter, bleakly funny vision is best viewed in his sporadically released volumes of the ""Acme Novelty Library"" from Fanatgraphics-- even more so than in his bound collection of Jimmy Corrigan narratives (almost all of which came from the previously published ANLs). The early large-format ANLs are unsurpassed, and this new volume returns to those heady days-- this huge magazine format, in full color, shows Ware to his best advantage. As always his draftsmanship is precise to the point of absurdity, and his characters suffer unimaginably in his peculiar little hells. Ware is without equal-- buy this and see why, then investigate the first four ANLs as well to see more of his best."
2,Unbelievably poor sizing,"So I had read all the other reviews, and many of them had mentioned that these run too small. I'm 5'8"" and have pretty small hands for a guy and somewhat thin fingers, but instantly ruled out the small size based on the reviews. I got the Medium (and my hands are in no way Medium), and lo and behold, it is too small, a struggle to get them on, and doesn't allow me to grip well, so I'm going to have to get large! Just absolutely ridiculous. If you could see my hands, the idea that I could be a Large in gloves that are presumably not sized for children is pretty much inconceivable. I don't know how it's possible to screw up the sizing this badly. The sizing chart is not accurate. I can't emphasize this enough: 1 size bigger at the least is essential, but if in doubt, go 2 sizes bigger."
5,Awesome,I love these gloves...they dont hurt your wrist when ur lifting heavy and sometimes i feel like i lift heavier because of them
3,"sturdy, needs more padding",The wrist wrap on these gloves is very stiff. My fingers go numb when they are tight enough to support my wrists. The good points are that the back of the glove has velcro and the stitching is better than the classic model. The palms have no padding under the leather.
2,Self Wipe is very awkward to use,"I bought the Self Wipe Toilet Aid to help my elderly mother who has arthritis, this item is expensive, and difficult to use. If you use it to just dabble around it's ok, but if you really need to wipe, forget it. The paper comes off and you end in a real mess."
3,This is not Terrence Malick's movie,"I wanteed to see what the original film version of James Jone' book was like. It deviates quite a bit from the book and it is definetely is not Terrence Malick's version which is one my all time favorites. Jack Warden plays Sergeant Welch and his ""oppenent"" is Private Donnel (played by Keir Dullea). They don't come off nearly as good as Sean Penn and Jim Caviezel in Malick's film. The movie is an interesting contrast however. I just won't be replaying it as much as I replay Malick's film."
5,Forget Me Not...,"A series of murders w/ the same M.O. puzzles police as they each appear to have been committed by a different suspect. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman in red seems to be the key to everything. RETRIBUTION is an excellently executed ghost story w/ a fresh approach, and some nice little twists along the way. This one is right up there w/ the likes of PULSE, RINGU, and JU-ON..."
1,History book material,I have heard good things about the author. this book was difficult to read because it did not flow. the book is based on interviews. I expected the material to be more up to date. It's a good book for history of law enforcement.
3,VERY INTERESTING,"As a German speaker, I found this album to be entertaining. Hearing Johnny Cash singing in German was very interesting, too say the least. Most of the songs are by the other singer (a german ""country"" singer"") but, in my opinion, Cash's contribution is well worth the price."
4,Interested In Wicca? Buy This Book,"Though this is a VERY good book.. it still lacks information.. The divinitions, prayers, and spells were wonderful.. and simple enough for a beginner.. this book is excellent for teaching.. This book is something everyone interested in Wicca should buy since its informative and simple to follow. Blessed Be"
4,GREAT SPIRITUAL GUIDE,"Once again Trish Telesco offers a great spiritual guidance with this book. Nothing is really new, but still it gives you something to think about, to help you through different situations, and to expand your mind. This time its packed with prayers, meditations and spells. A chapter on easy to use divination-methods is also included and helpful for the unexperienced ones. Its a great book that people from all cultures and with different religious-belives can read, because its message is a universal one."
2,Very Dangerous- can poison your child,"Parents that purchase these cups know that the 4 pieces of the top must be removed and separated to clean them properly BUT grandparents and child care providers may not. If the lids are washed without separating the pieces, mold can grow and poison your child. My mother gave one of these cups to my two year old this past weekend that had been left at her house by my nephew. She had washed it in the dishwasher, but not separated the pieces. When I took the cup apart that night to wash it the pieces were covered in mold. I've read stories of children getting severe food poisoning this way. I'm very lucky my daughter didn't show any signs of illness. YOU MUST BE CAREFUL."
2,Wait a pain!,"I tried these cups as a transition away from bottles with the soft top. My baby refused to use them and with 6 parts, it was a pain to take apart and clean. After a few tries, it wasn't worth it, they are too expensive and a pain to clean!"
1,wrong item shipped,"I received the toddler cup with the hard mouth piece. Desperatly needed the infants with the soft mouth piece for my ""special needs grand-daughter. I was very disappointed. Unfortunately I had already dispersed them out to family and schools."
1,Sounds cool...but not worth it,"The vent system on this cup sounds like a great idea, but it is not worth the hassle. My daughter sucks wells on sippy cups, but with this one, the liquid flow is very inconsistent and she is often sucking on air. In addition, they are much too difficult to clean.In all honesty, the best cups I've found have been the ventless ones. The liquid flow correctly and they are easy to clean. In my eyes, the vent system provides no benefit."
3,Spill proof but leaks,"I initially loved these cups. But soon was a little dissapointed.Pros:Spill Proof - why I got them in the first placesoft spout - good for teething timesinterchangeable parts - I didn't find the parts annoying as other reviewers did. (bottom cup-part, ring-top, spout, valve, and cap) I put all the parts in the top rack of my dishwasher and they come out perfectly cleanCons:It leaks - not from spout but from where the top and bottom screw together when it is left on its side or upside down; have to put in a ziplock bag when in the diaper bagIf the company fixed the leaking problem this cup would be pretty much perfect."
1,absolutely horrible,"Don't waste your money on this product. Avent has great bottles, but this product has so many flaws. From leaks to so many parts involved. Horrible! And I hate to give avent a bad rating but its true."
1,no OSX support,"I just purchased your firewire iBOT webcam, and I'm very unhappy that I have to pay more for OSX support.OSX is no longer new. How do you get away with selling a product and then charging more to make it usable with current system software???OS9 is OLD!!!! Wake up!!! Not only that, i can't even download the required drivers....I have to have them shipped at my time and expense. WEAK!!!WAKE UP!I am also a PC user...this is the last Orange Micro product I will buy."
4,Great Grill Cover,"I love this product. I give it to my new customers after I build a home for them. I am a home builder in Mount Pleasant SC [...] and my clients love them. I also bought one for myself.I have only had it for a year or so, so I will have to see how long it lasts, but so far so good."
1,A collection of poor sounds,"It is true that this ""best of"" collection contains Caetano classics, but these are old recordings from the 60s, 70s and 80s. The sounds are poor, recording techniques primitive and one is left to wish for better production work. So, I would recommend this cd only to a listener who truly loves old sounds. For all others I would say: look for newer recordings of these songs. They are available."
2,SOME OF THE STORIES WAS ENOUGH,"The first four or five stories were enough. After that,they were like a bean burrito---they kept repeating on you!!Same story---change the color of the princess's shoes.Everything had three's of everything---three horses---three rings----three heads----three earthquakes---three--three---three. This book was okay for a while---then Istarted to skip whole stories when they repeated."
2,mediocre sound quality that got worse,This always seemed to have mediocre sound quality (both in my ear as well as in the opinion of those I spoke to with it). It seems to be getting worse over the few months I've had the refurbished version I bought and I am looking into returning it.
2,Flimsy,"I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor, the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset, the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack, which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size, I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good, fits in my ear OK, and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives, I will be replacing it with another brand."
1,Did not arrive with all the parts described,"I ordered this product going on the ""product description"" that says it has a vehicle charger, customizable ear gels, and optional ear loop. None of those three things arrived with the headset. I simply received the headset, wall charger, and usb charger. Other sellers are apparently selling it with ALL the pieces, but ""Abacus 24-7"" apparently is not."
2,Not worth it,It sounds good and people hear me well so far. The part that goes in your ear comes off easily and is lost easily. The charge is easily lost the charging process is not good. As I said before the car charger is any good because the adapter that goes with isnt with the product. This bluetooth doesnt allow for listening to music either. It fell out of my ear in to the sink and worked after get wet so that is a good thing.
3,Disappointed,"I bought it because it was highly recommended by people but for me I was disappointed. I had to keep pushing it into my ear to hear well and also couldn't find just the right fit for my ear, so it kept wobbling. For the money I paid, I expected more."
3,Average,"LIGHT OF HER HEARTMorgan St. James was by far the most virile man Miranda Tallant had ever seen. From his thick locks of midnight silk to his well muscled chest rippling with unchecked power, Miranda realized at once that this man was no ordinary lighthouse keeper. But while she did not know if he had come to investigate her family's smuggling or if he truly had been disinherited, one glance at his emerald dark eyes promisd her untold nights of desire.KEEPER OF HIS LOVEBent on discovering the blackguards responsible for his friend's death, Morgan didn't expect to be caught up in the stormy sea of Miranda Tallant's turquoise eyes. The lovely widow consumed his every waking thought and his every dream with an all encompassing passion. For while he could not abandon his duty to his friend and his family, he knew that he could not rest until Miranda's heart was his."
4,soft-porn vampire flick,"I bought this because I am interested in films, and this was a director I hadn't heard of. I find the genre entertaining: soft-porn vampire films with a lesbian overtone. Although the acting is a bit marginal, the film is fun to watch. To quote Lincoln, just the thing for people who like that sort of thing. I use it with the subtitles turned off to practice my French: it's slow theatrical clearly enunciated French (but I wouldn't recommend that a French HS teacher show it to a class for that purpose)."
3,not bad for an old movie,"It was a nice way to recall old traditions and product. The production values are good. There are some minor scratches and a few times where the volume faded in and out, put it just might have been my dvd player. The acting isn't the best, the writing could use a touch up here and there. There is some nice skin and lots of see-through clothing; all-in all, the movie was worth renting. I don't know if it's one that you can watch more than once or twice, but it isn't bad."
5,"MOST INNOVATIVE CASE I""VE SEEN!","I love this case. fits like a glove, protects from scratches and really adds a great look to my MacBook Pro. I'm the most anal user, but this case really does add beauty and protection to the already perfect MacBook Pro. Like the other reviewr said, this case is only for the Core Duo version, but I know they are making one that fits both. Hands down, the best laptop case I've ever used."
3,Speck Macbook Case Not For A1260,"Somewhat disappointed because the product details said that this case was for the older Macbook Pros with core duo. Well I have an older Macbook Pro with a core 2 duo but the case does not fit quite right. The top part fits fine, the bottom part fits fine and has the right position for the ports on the left and the cd slot, but does not have the right positioning for the holes on the right side. So with the case I can't access my network/ethernet, usb, or firewire ports. The display/dvi port is accessible. I think the details could have been more detailed I have a Macbook Pro A1260 with core duo, looks just like the picture with aluminum body, front cd slot, I still have the case on but it is a little annoying. For your Macbook model just look at the bottom of the notebook towards the back, in small font."
3,good buy,i got this book expecting that i would be using it for class but in all reality i really didn't use it as much
5,The Real Thing !!!!!,"This is an excellent addition to the Taoist literature available in the West today. Within you will find a blending of the philosophical roots of Taoism and the foundational practices for directly experiencing ""yourself"" in Tao. Useful and clear information about Taoist Breating, Meditation, and Dissolving Pratices. Written by a Taoist Lineage Master who is one of few qualified to teach ""Living"" Taoism in the West.Overall it is a potent distilation of a ""mysterious"" subject into an helpful, enjoyable, clarifying and powerful read. A Must read for anyone(beginners to advanced) looking to delve deeper into Tao."
1,product is defective,"excellent program, HOWEVER DVD encoding is pathetic; there is frequent loss of lip syncwhich is completely distracting; how can they release this with this problem?"
4,Worked as expected - first time,"Ordered the 2065500 2410SA enclosure kit and (separately) 4x 200GB Maxtor SATA drives. Installation requires 3x3.5inch drive bays, but my case had a support bar in front of the power supply, requiring the 2410SA to stick out 2 inches! No matter to me since it works. Install went easy - plug in the cables to the enclosure before installation and thread them into the computer case (save some frustration getting to the sockets.) Requires two power connectors from your supply. Had to eliminate the DVD drive and go USB 2.0 external due to space and power in my system. Is working fine on a 250watt power supply. Follow the instructions and everything went together fine; worked first time. I now have 565GB in RAID 5. Pulled a drive while writing to the array - nothing lost. Replaced the drive and it reconfigured as expected. I'm happy."
2,Quite annoying,"well, you can't really listen to this. Period. I do think that the band is talented, but it's too bad that the songs just suck. They aren't really catchy at all, and the singer is just stupid. I probably would like them a lot better in concert, but I doubt I'd go see them anyways. If you want a good cd, go buy something else besides this. I'd rather listen to glassjaw."
3,Waist Deep,"This is decent ""gangsta"" movie about the streets of LA. Some have compared it to a modern Bonnie and Clyde but I wouldn't go that far, it doesn't have quite the same kind of tension that movie had. If you enjoy movies with rappers acting like BA gangstas talking down to everyone you will probably like it. One good message is a gansta trying to keep his son out of the scene. If you enjoy realistic dramas you may not enjoy this movie. Although a decent action, it really never came across as realism. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Stomp the Yard"".CA Luster"
2,NOT a popular history of telecommunications!,"If you're thinking that this book is a comprehensive popular overview of the history of telecommunications, forget it. It really is about Morton Bahr's career with the Communications Workers of America. After reading Tom Standage's outstanding ""Victorian Internet"" book, my view of the Web as the modern-day telegraph was enhanced. But, the title of this book is so unfairly mis-leading, that it's a shame. Don't look to this book as a popular history of the Internet!"
1,it stopped working after two weeks. i threw it out.,it stopped working after two weeks . i threw it out. a lesson learned : never buy used products on the web.
2,Garbage... weak.. and Boring...,"This is by far the WORST KMFDM RELEASE... No Esch, No Schulz, just Sascha and Skold messin around with a little Pig.. At first listen this album is not bad but once you get used to it, this album is really boring.. Dirty, Skurk, and Preach/Pervert are really the only songs worth listening to. I was embarrased to listen to ""Risen"". It was just lyrically horrible I don't know what's wrong with them. Now in Skold's defense, he is a badass, his voice is cool and he's a good writer his solo album is good. But we had him in Symbols, Adios, MDFMK, and Attak it was just a bit much. This album is bland at times good and most times pretty bland. Not what you think when you think KMFDM, though Urban Monkey Warfare is still cool... whatever I am one guy buty it, if you like awesome, if not sorry..."
2,Stop Recycling!,"I'm so sick of hearing ""KMFDM, doin' it again!"", or some other sort of pretentious variation on it like ""Look at us, no don't look at them, look at us, we're special!"" The only reason that I even gave this piece of recycled garbage 2 stars is because it actually has some good songs on it. But the fact still remains that KMFDM died when En Esch and Gunter Schulz left the band, and in my opinion it needs to stay dead. Adios was a great farewell album, hence the name Adios. But this just ruins it for me. KMFDM would have remained a legend had it not been for this album. Now they're just another group of people who failed to make good music independently and have fallen back into the safety net that is now KMFDM. ... My advice to the shoppers: buy Symbols, Nihil, or Adios, but not this."
3,Not too good,"Maybe I was too excited when i saw the return of KMFDM. I had highhopes for the band that left us with Adios and had a half hearted return with MDFMK. But Attak was not worth the wait. It seems forced and cliche. You will find yourself singing the wrong words to the new songs, wishing you were listening to the original song that is being borrowed heavily from. Then you may find yourself just plain bored with something that sounds way too much like an attempt at mainstream. Highlights? The songs with Lucia singing are best."
2,Save your money,"I bought these after my son had trouble learning how to drink out of other sippy cups. He did like these, but they leak! I do like the idea of the softer spout, which is easier for a child to learn on when transitioning from a bottle. Once he got used to using a cup, I went and bought more gerber and playtex cups, which I can throw into my purse for an outing and know they will not leak. Save your money and buy the less expensive cups, at least until Advent fixes the problem."
5,All Avent Products,"I have purchased most of the Avent feeding system products, including the breast pump, warmer and Microwave sterilzer. Just last night I saw the flow valves that will convert my son's bottles into sip cups and plan to use them starting at 3mo. My husband and I are very pleased with all of these products and the ease of use. Avent makes it easy to save money by making everything interchangeable all the way through the toddler years. I would DEFINITELY recommend these products to everyone!!"
1,too fussy,I have to give this cup a big thumbs down. It contains too many parts that are (1) difficult to clean and (2)easy to loose while washing.These are expensive as well as fussy- really not worth it!
3,Take it or leave it...,"LikeI like that it can be mix & matched with other Avent productsI like that the spout is soft as opposed to hard ones that my son refuses to drink from.I like that it is easy to clean.I like the colors.DislikesA little bit awkward in shape for a child to hold easily without the handles.I have never had issues with leaking but I do not dishwasher any of my baby bottles and I know that helps. My SIL has leakage she dishwashers and I have never had a leaky bottle, and I don't. Just a suggestion (time consuming yes but oh well).It's a mensa-mensa item. I love the handles but those can be bought separately so therefore, I would say this item can be done without."
4,great for the money,The ad did not give dimensions so I took a chance to fit my phantom 177. with a 4x32 scope attached into the case. It doesnt fit with the scope attached but luckily the plastic was cheap enough so that it would bend around the scope in the handle portion of the case. I would recommend this case to someone with a rifle WITHOUT A SCOPE ATTACHED or a shot gun. It is plenty long enough and will fit most any long barrel firearm and keep it clean and safe with foam cushion on the inside. It has three holes for pad locks at the front middle and bottom. it has four clasps for sturdy closing. its light weight and sturdy for the money.
5,Perfect Inexpensive Case!,"This is a great case if you are on a budget. Some people have complained about the durability, but it's fairly thick and solid. I would have no qualms standing on it. The foam is decent foam, yes it does fall out, but you can throw a little glue in there if you are that worried about it. There is an area by the handle to attach a lock which worked out perfect for me. I have a shotgun in mine, with a foregrip attached on the bottom, and a tactical flashlight on top - and it fits. So I'm assuming your scoped rifle will fit as well...The only setback for me is that I ordered from another company, and they didn't show in their picture that there is a deer scene on the front of the case. However, it's pretty muted, and not at all tacky, so I kept it. I would take off a star for this, but it actually looks decent, so I have to stick with 5 stars. Value + Construction = 5 stars."
3,Could have been a bit more heavy duty.,I have seen similar rifle cases for twice the price that are really heavy duty. I get burned once in a while on Amazon and assume everything is a deal. That would be the case here. Half the price = half the quality.... no deal at all. You need to use all three pad lock openings to stop someone from bending open this case and slipping out the rifle from either the ends or middle. 2/3 locks is not enough.Good for your kids .22LR
1,Not great,I did not like this product. It is not creamy and smooth. Its more harder and hard to spread on to your face. I would not recommend this product.
4,Consultant's must have,Book goes into much deeper topics such as deploying software via Group Policy. It even discusses modifying the registry keys for how the RWW is built.Discusses using MS Access with Sharepoint and much more.
4,"Good but incomplete, needs follow through","Harry is famous for writing books, and I like his ""Down to earth humor"", real world stuff.My only complaint, is that he mentions a feature that isn't in the book, but will come out in the ""Advance or next version"" The advance version never comes out, as he moves to another project.I'm still waiting for the ""Advance topics version"""
5,FFH I WOULD LIKE TO BE LIKE THEM,"THIS CD IS A BRILLIANT SHOW OF GODS TRUE GRACE IN THE MUSIC! TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND THE SONG, THEN YOU WILL BE FEELING THIS ONE. THE SONGS HAVE SUCH GREAT MEANING! THIS CD BRINGS ME TO TEARS QUITE OFTEN! IF YOU LOVE GOD AND YOU LOVE MUSIC THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. I COULD NOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT BUT WHERE IS THE NEW ONE AT?"
1,Worthless document,"Parenting is the problem. Poor character is being passed down from parents to students. It is NOT a problem with teaching or education. This book is enabling, and not addressing the real problem."
5,Met every expectation I had,"This film was one that I had heard a lot about. It played at Sundance. It was playing the independent theater circuit. I had wanted to see it for months and had not been able to get around to it. Finally, I had the opportunity to see it at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. My expectations were high because of the months of anticipation, but leaving the theater I found every one of them fulfilled. Ryan Gosling's performance was one of the most brilliant things I've ever seen. The supporting cast matched him step for step. The story was not easy to digest, so those not willing to see conflict among characters without clear, defined, movie-ending resolution should skip it. Those who are interested in an original idea, executed to near perfection, that will keep you thinking about its ideas, characters, and scenes for months after: you will not be disappointed. I bought it the week it came out on dvd."
2,A great cast can't save an unfulfilled script,"As other reviews have stated the cast is great and the acting is really good. But this film suffers from an unfulfilled script. There could have been so much more developed with the characters, plot, and lack of a climax. At the end of the movie not a whole lot has changed and the script ends where it should have been about 2/3 of the way through the film.If you are in to indie flicks that pull this type of half hearted attempt at a plot all the time by all means check it out for AAA acting but I can't give these kinds of scripts a free pass especially when it could have been a really memorable flick.Bottom line:acting greatstory solid and interestingscript is a suck with slow development and very little in the way of climaxpretty piss poor ending"
4,Thorough and engaging,The information about Andy's childhood provided some illuminating explanations for his later actions. Still a complex man who could not be completely understood. Details of his New York years filled in some blanks in my knowledge and understanding. I also appeciated the cultural context the author provided. Clear writing.
4,Good Intro to Most Aspects of Land Use Law,"The book appears to cover all of the topics in land use law (in the US) from historical overview to recent cases on environmental topics. The text would be easier to read if the font used for the cases was different (or different size) from the discussion/notes provided by the authors. Sometimes the authors' opinions seem to blur with the opinions/commentary of the cases, especially when trying to read pages and pages fast and late at night."
5,great T,"Super comfortable summer shirt. Does a great job of keeping you cool via the wicking fabric. The red color is very vibrant, one of my favorite T's."
4,As Long as You Have a Little Hand-Eye Coordination!,"This is an improvement over its predecessors. If you want a realistic football sim this is not a game for you. If you want a game in which anything goes, then this is defeinitely your game!Play calling is simle and as long as you have a little hand-eye coordination, throwing completed passes is easy. Once you fully understand the controls INTs are not a problem; SO READ THE MANUAL FIRST. If you played the arcad version (Blitz 2000) and enjoyed it, this will blow you away."
5,I love romance movies about older people!,My CD arrived quickly and without problem. I have seen this movie many times before and felt I had to have it in my collection. I am happy with it!
3,Lighthearted Fluff for the Silver Set,"Worth two and a half chuckles. Affluent Florida retirees cope with isolation and bereavement by forging human connections, often reverting to the sex-obsessed years and patterns of junior high. Don't get hung up on status and trappings, the film seems to say, if you find someone with whom you genuinely connect.I would write more, but I've got to get to the Early Bird special buffet that starts at 3:30 PM..."
3,OK - only,The music with the exception of the titled song was less then impressive. As a whole it is only a fair production and I would not recommend it.
1,Ms Brightman should be ashamed!!,"Being a Sarah Brightman fan of the highest magnitude, I was thoroughly disgusted with the girl for allowing herself to put out such a dismal, low quality and frightful CD as ""Harem."" I'm afraid that I will have to [throw it away] and take the loss...Ms Brightman has either lost her voice[], is lazy []or has let her ego get the best of her.I implore you....DO NOT WASTE YOUR FUNDS OR TIME ON THIS ..."
4,West meets the middle east,"I heard this album almost a year after it was released. I have never been a Sarah Brightman fan but this album has something very special to offer.Sarah Brightman has successfully blended middle eastern elements with her angelic voice sprinkled with some good ""pop"" sensitivity. The songs on the album appear to be thematically similar but yet add to the overall flavor of the album in different ways.The best track on the CD is ""Beautiful"" - a gorgeous love song that is extremely addictive. The other highlights of the album are ""It's a beautiful day"" and ""Mysterious days"".""Harem"" is a classic example of fusion of musical elements that can sound mainstream and yet stand out from the rest. The album is most certainly worth your while."
2,"Oh, Sarah","I'm a fan of Sarah. I like her a lot, but I don't like when she sings pop songs. She doesn't have the voice for it. Too airy, too soft. This is an album of pop songs. Not good.I like pop music. I like Sarah. But I don't like the two together. It's not that I feel Sarah should only stick to the music she usually sings, that classical/opera type music. But I do think she should stick to music she can actually sing. She's just not a pop singer. It's like Britney Spears, it's not her songs that are bad, it's her voice. Same thing applies to this album, it's not Sarah's songs, it's her voice. Doesn't fit. I will say, however, that her re-make of ""What a Wonderful World"" was a bit out of place. That was a bad song and a bad voice.If you're thinking about buying this cd, don't. You'll be mad if you do."
1,?????,"like saugages, brightman keeps churning out ""stuff"" from her factory. none of my business except my local [stores] keeps playing this cd while i drink coffee and read the newspapers. the noise gets in the way of my daily routine, and gets me out of the place sooner than usual. it'll end one of these days, right?0 star."
5,Welcome to the Harem,"This is a great CD! My first from Sarah Brightman to be exact. I love the blending of melodies and the spice and flair of the Middle-Eastern sounds as well. Sarah has a wonderful voice, and I love the diversity of the songs. 'Harem' has a house beat kinda, to get your heart pumping. 'Free' is much more slow, and seductive. This is a very enjoyable CD and I recommend it to anyone with an open mind to hear something different, welcome to the harem. Peace, Dakota"
2,"Harem, Sarah Brightman","My wife and I are both Sarah Brightman fans and have been looking forward to her new CD with an advance order.But, the anticipation was far better then the actuality. In our opinion, Harem lacked both the orchestrations and utilization of Brightman's terrific voice of past CDs and, thusly, has our opinion putting Harem at the bottom of all her CDs that we currently have.Classics, La Luna, Best of Sarah Brightman, even Dive are better."
4,Lots of fun to read,"This book has a very simple concept - taking off all of Maisy's many layers of clothing and then putting on her bathing suit so that she can go swimming. My 2 year old son loves it to pieces - literally. Unfortunately it's not very robust, but even now with half the pages in tatters it's still one of his favorites."
2,Yuck! Did 'Undies' Have To Be Included?,"Lucy Cousins has a great idea with ""Maisy Goes Swimming"" but did 'undies' have to be included? But as gross as the book was, the illusrations were quite good, so I gave it another star. Let's just hope that the subject of undergarments are not mentioned in future books. Thank you."
5,Regarding henry,"This is an awesome video.Five stars.I love Harrison ford and this was a differnt role for him. this didn't have any action in it like all his other movies. This movie was sweet. It shows how a man who at one point his life doen't care about his family. then he gets shot and ends up in a coma. he must learn everything all over again ex. talking ,walking. He falls in love with his wife and daughter all over again. this pulls at your heart strings."
3,regarding henry,My wife liked it. She is more into that type than I. She thought it was good. Harrison Ford is good in anything he plays in.
3,"improbable, yet predictable","If you enjoy touching stories with happy endings and are willing to suspend disbelief, this can be an enjoyable movie. I did enjoy it, but all the way through I had to suppress thoughts like: Yeah, right. Like that would ever happen. No one behaves like that.All the Hollywood cliche characters behaved in Hollywood cliche fashion. Maybe that is a requirement for a ""good"" story, but they could at least behave like real people when it's not needed to advance the story line.For example, try watching a kid who is learning to read and see how he would sound out an unfamiliar word. Trust me, it would not be the same way that Henry did. I have to wonder if Hollywood writers ever get out and observe actual human beings."
4,Classic Harrison Ford with a great story,"This was a movie that I had seen years ago, but I wanted to add it to my collection. When I watched it, I enjoyed it as much as if I had seen it for the first time. I recommend this movie to anyone, as it is a great story, and a life scenario that often happens. Once people attain a certain level of success, priorities are often shifted, and important relationships are ignored. I will not ruin the plot, but it is an excellent story."
5,Best buy for PC 133 SD RAM,I looked around and this was the best deal on a 512MB stick of 133MHz RAM. I clocked the start up time on my old XP PC and I could see a big gain with the new RAM. Remember to install your fastest RAM in the bank closest to the CPU for best results. -Sol
4,Another solid effort from Julia ...,"This CD from Julia Fordham is another solid effort. Though many fans will always be searching for the next ""Porcelain"", this effort is not quite equal to that one. But the soulful, funky feeling established on ""Concrete Love"" dominates, making tunes such as ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""That's Life"" winners. ""Downhill Sunday"" is classic Julia, with great lyric twists and irony. The band on this is again fantastic - how could you go wrong with these session (and live) pros? I continue to wish Julia would be more well known to a broader audience, but take pleasure in the fact that I've loved her stuff for years (thanks Eileen!)."
2,Don't bother,"This CD is essentially one or two tracks with variations and alternate takes, for 75 minutes or so. And Miles' playing is rather uninspired, relying on hackney little blues phrases over and over on just about on every track. The only thing that stands out is the bleak vibe and the spontaneity of the session. If that means anything to the reader. But not an essential Miles purchase. Much of the music is available on a budget Polygram CD called COMPACT JAZZ, which contains other sessions with Charlie Parker and some others."
4,Good Collection,"This is a very good collection of my favorite short story author.It's hard to imagine anyone who hasn't read and loved O. Henry, but if for some reason you have discovered this work yet, this collection is a great place to begin."
1,Warning! Does not come with acid!,"This battery is shipped dry, which is expected, but does NOT include acid. Oddly enough, it comes with a filler tube and nowhere does it mention that there is no acid in the description. Same goes on the Powersport site, simply says it is shipped dry (which I assumed it still came with acid!). Don't bother buying this item. The same battery with a different part number cost $2 more from Powersports and comes with acid! Have not tried it yet but will report any quality issues. Also, despite living in the digital age, Powersport is unable to provide a tracking number or shipping information and items tend to arrive at the end of their estimated; i.e., if the estimate is 3-6 days, assume it will be 6 days, and delivery estimate email typically comes 2-4 days after you placed the order. It's sort of sad."
3,"Fascinating direct observations, but dated to the 1980s","The insightful parts of this book are when she's observing the behavior of traumatized children, especially the group kidnapped on the bus. That portion of the book is fascinating and stimulating, and her insights seem well-grounded and profound. The less good parts deal with repressed memory and satanic abuse, and the book's 1980's age really shows there. The bad parts of the book read like the papers of a frustrated english student where she draws conclusions about a particular author's childhood trauma from fictional works."
3,Sleuthing out something I saw in this Video,"In the scene where the blonde lady whose husband is up for the job and he tells her how VERY important it is to him, as a result of which she consents to the rather distasteful proposal of the horrid little man who apparently has the power to see that her husband gets it, she is wearing a blue sweater of intricate cable design. I want to get a picture of it. this is not my first endeavour (is that really Morse's first name?) but I have had no luck, so while this is perhaps the wrong forum, I am posting it in the hope that someone out there shares my fascination with this pattern and will contact me."
1,The S&M Trainer,"The late Vicky Hearne was never considered a great trainer across the board. Those that believe in Positive Reinforcement training consider her techniques and ideology to be cruel and unnecessary. For instance: holding a dogs head in a hole filled with water to stop the dog from digging. There are other methods that can stop the behavior without using such barbaric methods. Her techniques should not be used, and notice, the aggressive dogs she deals with are never rehabilitated into mainstream doggy life as it were. They are never trained to the point of being trusted. So much for her methods."
4,For the Romantics,I found this to be a fun book to give as a gift because it's beautifully drawn and has cute ideas to spice up our love lives. I also think that the illustrations spoof today's image-concious gay society. The guys ARE gorgeous - but that only makes it the more pleasant to browse thru.
4,"Winter Song, Roberta Gellis","In this sequel to Siren Song, Alys and Raynond have married and journey to France to his home in Aix. The book is filled with adventure, misunderstandings, describes battles, a kidnapping and has a really nasty villain. Though at times it seems to bog down, the book on the whole is quite readable. I would have liked more emphasis on the historical happenings and less on the fictional lovers, but I am sure I am in a minority on this."
1,WORST JACK KETCHUM NOVEL EVER!,"This is the absolute worst novel Jack Ketchum has ever written. I don't know what these readers that gave it such a high rating require in their reading material, but evidently, not much. It has no plot, no character development, mindless, senseless violence, and makes absolutely no sense. I am a Jack Ketchum fan and have read just about every novel he has written, and I can't believe he wrote this drivel."
2,Where can I fish in the USA?,Contents are geared for where to fish around the USA rather than demonstrating techniques used in tailwaters. One of the co-authors does little to add to the information contained therein.
4,'guess I'm bucking the tide,I find that the 2nd CD's live set starts to drag & brings this from a 5 star release down to 4. Still...no collection should be without disc 1 in one form or another.
3,"Good history, inspiring","This is kind of a history told by those who lived it - almost. First published in 1926 when this new science of biology (that we all now take for granted) was the thing of wonder and mystery Kruif writes a timeless classic about the first explorers of the microbe universe.The writing is a bit heavy and the story is told in a dramatized fashion. Still, though, the book is a great read and very inspiring. A fascinating look into the world of science and discovery."
1,Should have been revised decades ago,"I am amazed at the positive reviews. I purchased this book for a ""nostalgia trip,"" recalling that it was one of my favorite books in early adolescence, in a small, rural town, a high school with a marginal library, and few books in the science section. Upon reading it again, I was appalled at the poor quality of writing. No only is it clearly prejudiced, it is inexcusably so, even for 1926. That de Kurif did not later revise it to reflect a more objective perspective and a more lucid treatment seems inexcusable. Certainly, underneath the awkward prose and inexcusably obscure vocabulary there lies interesting recounts of scientific exploration, but for such a ""classic,"" a revision would have certainly been in order. Though I struggled through it, I am sure that in my youth I found it even more frustrating, underlying content notwithstanding. As a retired teacher, I would never suggest it to any young reader."
2,I would rather read the dictionary,"This book was given to us by our school, for summer reading. I don't like reading in the first place, but they make us read it on our VACATION!?!? And it has to deal with science, my worst subject. It took me a while to read and while it started out boring...surprisingly it got a microbit better. Mabey I'm just not the scientist...or the person with paitients, or the kind of person that grew up like these other people that put their comment in. I mean, it was written in what? 1940? Mabey I just don't understand this author, anyway, thats what I thought of it. You can Email me if you dissagree, but I'm not trying to start an argument. We are all entitled to our own opinions. Also Email me if you had to read this because of your school/work, and didn't like it."
3,Walk to Vermont,"This book started out slow, but it really picks up and is an interesting read, especially when the author hits the Appalachian Trail. I found it hard to put down the book at that point."
4,"Very good, but not perfect","""The New Complete Coffee Book"" is an excellent coffee table book on coffee. It tells you most of what you need to know, and is impressively presented in a way which would look good on any coffee table.Nonetheless, this book could, I feel, have done with a few more basic bits of information. I would have enjoyed a section on how to make basic coffee (ie latte, cappucino, machiato) - even if these are considered 'simple' coffee making skills. Also, a bit more information on the different aspects of different coffee region produce would have been good. Furthermore, there is a section on savoury coffee meals (lamb with coffee rub, anyone?) which can at best be described as superflous.On the whole, though, the book is pretty damn good, and certainly worthy of purchase. I am very happy with it."
3,Minotar,"I liked the plot, however the book had too many people and descriptions going on. It was hard to keep track of what it was all about. The language was poor. I served in the US Army and many of my friends right off the front lines of Korea didn't talk that way. It took away from the story. A great book otherwise. I also own the hard copy of ""The Disciple"". Sergio"
3,"Not bad, but not so original","This was a not bad effort by Alpha Yaya Diallo. It's a nice listen but a little disappointing. You don't need to read the notes to realize he lives in either Europe or North America. The music has a very noticeable western influence to it, which is perhaps understandable since Diallo now lives in Vancouver. If you're looking for something a little more purely Africa, try Ali Farka Touré..."
2,Baker's Holiday,"This is a mid-sixties recording of Chet and though there are a few good moments, Chet is not in top form. ""Travelin' Light"", the opening track, is a great song with sparse arrangements but unfortunately, Chet's pitch is flat(sorry Chet). As for the other tracks, some are memorable, though kind of 60's/New York/Mary Tyler Moorish...I would recommend his albums ""Italian Sessions"" as some free spirited, top notch playing and ""My Funny Valentine"" to hear his voice. Chet Baker was a fantastic musician but I really think the best thing about this album is the material."
4,A Nice Linear Tale,"This is a nice outing for Morse--a linear tale with minimal twists. A convicted rapist has escaped from prison and is returning to Oxfordshire for several purposes. The first is revenge; the second seems to be to torment and taunt Morse by assuming seemingly-impenetrable disguises. The putative action involves devil worship, but Morse immediately perceives that the evil here is human and not supernatural or metaphysical. The catch-me-if-you-can story involves a twist or two but I won't spoil it by revealing them. There is some interplay between Morse and Lewis and a few Morsean one-liners, but the focus here falls upon the plot and the clever villain."
2,"The ""Unoriginal"" Bad Company","After several listens, I've decided to dispense with this disc. Not only is it incomplete as a ""hits"" collection, but it is also downright boring. Compared to the chaotic sound of the Mick Ralphs-period Mott The Hoople, or the burning rope that was Paul Kossoff and Free, these guys were so tame. After all, ""Can't Get Enough,"" ""Movin' On,"" and ""Ready For Love"" were all Mott rewrites. If you enjoy this set, you'll need to exercise rigorously, eat more fiber, and get out of the house more often. When you return, seek out the notable Mott The Hoople and Free sites on the web, and observe. There was a time when these guys, save for Boz Burrell, ripped, but this was not it. Me, I'll wait until ""10 From 6 Plus"" comes out to revisit these second-rate memories."
3,LIKE WERE IS?,WERE IS THE WAY I CHOOSE CLEARLY THEIR BEST TRACK ALONG SIDE THEIR SONG BAD CO AND HOWBOUT ANNA YOUNG BLOOD ELECTRIC LAND AND OTHERES BUY THE BLACK ALBUM ALONG WITH BURNING THE SKY AND THE OTHER ORIGINALS THEN IF YOU WANT THE OTHER SONGS GO AHEAD
3,"A dry read, but worthwhile","A dry read, but worthwhile, June 7, 2009If I wasn't reading this book for our book club, I probably wouldn't have finished it. For a lay person, the first two chapters are especially tough to get through with lots of terminology and unfamiliar banking concepts. It reads less like a story than a college textbook, but if you can plow through it, it will open your eyes about the banking industry. The fact that those morally corrupt executives could become so rich while manipulating everyone, including presidents and Congress, shows you that the white collar criminal wins more often than he loses, while the whistle blowers and the trusting public get screwed. It happened then, it's happening now. It'll happen again."
2,The third part is missing,"The first part of this book is readable not a thriller but good, it has to many pages that doesn't have to do with the story of the lost city, the cave and the treasure but you can read it. The second part of the book, the dream of Benjamin Kazin is just a waste of time, but I have to admit that WS has a lot of imagination.The problem of this book is that doesn't have an end, what happened with the cave? The lost city? The treasure?"
5,"Dis are GOOOOOD, I Garuhntee!!",Its a Classic. There will never be another quite like Justin Wilson. IF you enjoy Cajun Food and Culture... gotta have this one in your library.
5,Nice and unusual knife,"Well... looking at it you'd think there'd be a lot to say, but there isn't. This is a nice quality and unusual looking knife. The feature you and I all notice is that pointy tail end, but it isn't really, the tail is flat and normal knife width. It's just that the handle is more hand shaped, more shaped to hold, rather than shaped round the tang of the blade, as normal knives are. So it looks unusual, but it works well. I bought this as a test and I don't regret it."
4,Fun and Light,"I have watched this DVD several times and always enjoy the characters portrayed. Steve Martin does a great job as well as the supporting actors. The story is a little cheesy in some spots, but, all in all, it is an enjoyable ""don't think too hard about it"" type of film."
2,dissapointing,"I made the mistake of playing ""Call of Duty"" first based on reviews. Enjoyed myself so much that I bought this because it looked comparable; Big mistake. Call of Duty...Wow. Medal of Honor...Yawn."
1,Do not buy discs burned/replicated incorrectly!,"Already had this game but lost the breakthrough expansion disc, so bought this whole package with the intention of using only the last disc 'breakthrough'. Unfortunately that was the only disc not included. There was a disc labeled 'breakthrough' but the contents were that of the 'spearhead' disc. I checked numerous times on different computers and still the same. So I basically have two 'spearhead' discs. Didn't return because it would cost me more. Great game, if they would have included it....."
4,"MOH Allied Assault, with two bonuses","I liked this product. Just got back into the shootem up games. The only problem I have had is the graphics. Background buildings, etc. fade in and out and are white or grey until they become closer to the player. I must need a better video card. I am currently looking for one."
1,It sucks,"I could not download this game or expansion pack. I have a xp windows and I email EA and they did not contact me about the problem. Of course by the time I tried to download it, it was over 90 days and it was too late to return it."
5,My kind of book,"I really enjoyed Island of Dreams, especially after reading A Midnight Clear. It's a terrific sequel, but it IS a sequel. So read A Midnight Clear first."
2,Island of confusion,"I love Katherine Stone's books, that is until I read this one. This is a story that did nothing but bore me. Again do not get me wrong I do enjoy Ms. Stone's other works but this one is a real stinker. The was no plot or character development, she never gives you a chance to care about any of these characters. The only character in this book that I appreciated was the glass sculptures. Ms. Stone does have a way with desribing surroundings that makes you feel like you are there or want to be there. (That's why I give it 2 stars). If you want a book of Ms. Stone's that has everything a good story should have, characters to care about, a plot that drags you in, and a world around you that seems to good to be true, I recommend two of her early works- ""Pearl Moon"" or ""Rainbows"". With either one of these you will not be wasting your time as with this book."
1,Why don't any of the 5 star ratings have names??? Very ODD,"I just started listening to this book and found it really hard to get into. I decided to look at the reviews and all of the 5 star reviews just say A customer. Is that even legal in Amazon? Author, if you are going to falsely inflate your rating, at least get some reviews with names. This is really, really obvious and you should be embarassed!!!"
2,Disappointing,"After reading 'Thief of Hearts' and loving it, I couldn't wait to read Island of Dreams. What a let down! There are two sets of main characters whose lives bisect over a long ago mystery. There was plot but no pizazz. The characters instantly fall in love, then fight it until the last 6 pages of the book. I don't understand what the attraction is as the charcters weren't developed well.The opening chapter was so compelling that I thought it was going to be another 5 star winner but it spiralled downhill quickly. It had so much potential! It's as if Katherine wrote the first chapter and then someone else with little writing talent finished it. It was so inconsistant with other books I've read of Ms. Stone's. Pass on this one and read one of her other books."
5,Worth a Sunday Afternoon,"This was a very good episode of the Inspector Morse series. First of all, it let the audience in on a part of Morse's past that we hadn't explored before and also let us know about Lewis's life at home with his family as well. It also brought home the dangers of these modern day raves that teenagers attend and all the different drugs and sexual activities that they are exposed to when they attend such events. Mr. Thaw was really at his best in this one. He can certainly rest in peace because he left us a lasting legacy of brilliant work as Inspector Morse."
1,History Buffs,"If you are a history buff, you'll like this book. If you're not a history buff...and I am not... you will simply feel buffeted. The amount of historical references were overwhelming and the print is miniscule. I wanted practical suggestions for getting around and recommendations for how, when, and where to enjoy Turkey's beauties."
4,Preaching from the floor again.....,"Just a quick review.I don't believe this album is as strong as Mindcrime 1, Empire or even The Warning - BUT - I love it anyway!!!The title track is one of my 10 favourite song EVER. The vocal is phenomenal, menacing genius! Geoff Tate is the greatest of all time. The best songs on this album are brilliant, there are just a couple of self indulgent De Garmo fillers on it. Sorry Chris, you're not in Pink Floyd, please figure this out!!!"
4,great story terrible printing,"I think this was a great story. It was fun and engaging. It didn't seem to be as serious as the previous book, but I still loved all the characters that return for this book. I find any complaints about the ""gayness"" a bit over done. I suppose those people would rather there was nothing gay at all. The book never comes near a pornographic level as atleast one reviewer suggests.All and all a great deal of fun. That said, I wish he would choose a new publisher as the place delivers crap du jour once again. Typos that stop the flow of the reading. I find myself having to stop and reread sentences just to figure out what the writer actually meant. Font sizes change from page to page causing me to wonder if there is something signifigant being said but alas no, it's just a very poor printing of a really fun book."
1,"Awful, simpley awful...","I just got my degree and started my job search. I picked up a couple of books to help me write my resume. This book was one of them. Don't wast your time! The book stinks! It is unorganized, sloppy and provides uneeded information. I would avoid this book!JF"
1,"Save Your Time & Your Money,","and purchase one of the hundreds of other titles available on resume production. This tome is a dog, with fleas."
3,Disturbances,A really nice recording that would've been nicer if they had edited out the idiot that shrieks his approval every chance he gets.
4,Behind the Scenes View of Roman History,"Our human nature drives us to want to know the ""real story"" behind great historical personalities. Much like ""People"" or ""Us"" magazine, Suetonious gives his readers back curtain access to the lives of the rich and famous. No salacious story nor tantalizing scandal is ignored. While many of his portaits are interesting, most of the biographical sketches are ultimately mere fluff. Enjoyable but disjointed if you do not know your Roman history. Finally, the great British actor Derek Jacobi's audio performance really lifts what is really a three star book."
4,Handy Discontinued Film Pocket Camera!,"If you want a basic camera that can zoom and has multiple auto-everything features, this little film camera may be good for you. It was easy for me to carry around when I did not have room for a SLR (single lens reflex) camera. Took decent pictures with 400 ISO film, but lighting needs to be pretty darn good daylight lighting for the pix to look swell.Since purchasing this little baby, Minolta went out of the camera business in the mid 2000s. The Freedom Zoom 160 came out, I believe, in 2002, one of the last film point & shoot cameras.Now I have a digital point & shoot with video capability and a Pentax K-x DSLR that I use for serious photography. But for a back-up camera, the Minolta can't be beat."
3,"Great video, horrible audio mix","Hey, the video content of this DVD is great. Good presentation of notable points throughout the Sox season, and a good balance between the ALCS and Series content.That said, the disc is nearly unwatchable because the soundtrack drowns out nearly everything spoken on the disc. Really, the worst mixing job I've ever heard. Can't hear a d*mn thing when there is game play-by-play under the music.Pretty disappointed."
4,"Great not only for Boston Fans, but baseball fans, too","Speaking not really as a Boston fan, but as a fan of baseball (and therefore necessarily an anti-yankee fan), I bought this DVD with the hope that it would focus more on the humiliating defeat the yanks suffered at the hands of my new heros (joining the 2001 Diamondbacks), the 2004 Red Sox.This DVD did not disappoint. If you who don't really consider yourself a fan of Boston, but despise the yanks and are looking for something chronicling the worst choke in baseball history, this DVD is much better than the World Series DVD."
5,Excellent Resource at home or on the trail,"Once you get used to the format of the Audubon Field Guides, they are very easy to use. I especially like the the thumb tab approach to locating an entry. Like all the Audubon series, this guide is compact, well-written, precise, comprehensive, informative, brilliant color plates, with a tough outer cover that stands up to rugged trail use. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing :(,"I was so eager to get this calendar for our two year old and begin the fun tradition of counting down the days to Christmas. Unfortunately, this calendar did not meet my expectations. First, it's three dimensional which I hadn't realized. It fits together with two notches and is not very sturdy when set up. I was expecting a wall calendar style which I could just put on the fridge. This tree shaped style is nice to look at but something that my toddler wants to play with all the time. It's really too flimsy to play with since it's just thin cardboard. Also, the thing is loaded with gold glitter which comes off on the hands whenever you touch it to open the windows. This is very annoying to me, a contact lense wearer, and it gets all over clothes and everything! Third, the pictures inside the windows are not very interesting (granted I've only seen two so far...) and the illustrations are all a bit fuzzy and muted in style. It's not the kid-pleaser I had hoped for."
1,wrong actors listed for episode,"I purchased this DVD only because it said that the homes of bam margera and the osbournes would be shown. Ozzy osbourne is my most favorite actor/singer and I was very disapointed to find out, in fact, NEITHER of these actors homes were featured. I feel like I was mis-led into buying this disk and would advise anyone considering buying from this seller to be AWARE !!!"
5,"sammy and the count, wow!","do you really need to know more than the title of this album to want to own it? it lives up to the billing, if you love Sammy, love Count Basie, then buy it! MY FAVORITE CUT IS TEACH ME TONIGHT, BUT YOU CAN GET AN EVEN BETTER VERSION OF THIS WITH SARAH VAUGHAN AND THE COUNT BASIE ORCHESTRA ON THAT COLLABERATIVE EFFORT."
4,The Coupling Cast Grows Up In The Final Season,"Coupling is just as funny in it's fourth and final season as it ever was. The actor that plays Jeff has left the show, and Jeff has moved to the Island of Lesbos. His niche is filled with Oliver, a sci fi geek, who runs a Sci Fi shop and gets romantically entangled with Jane.The final season end with the charecter's being a bit more mature, and revolves around the romantic difficulties all three couples face."
2,lame review,"No Jeff, no explanation for why he's not in the show anymore. Replaced by Oliver. Format has changed from the previous 3 seasons, the new way is lame, annoying and not particularly funny anymore. We really enjoyed the first 3 seasons but are not enjoying the last season."
3,This is a very funny series,"It can be a bit raunchy at times - a lot of talk about sex, masturbatiion, but very honest in my opinion.It can be absolutely hilarious at times. A very realistic portayal of male - female points of view."
2,From great to crap,"I loved season 1-3, but was terribly disappointed in series 4. Why would they try and add a character who so obviously trying to replace Jeffery? You just cannot immitate that character. Richard Coyle is one in a million in that role. They would have been a lot better off with a fresh start adding a totally new character, but they didn't. Buy 1-3 but don't bother with 4 in my opinion."
3,Where's the wide screen edition?,"The original show was broadcast widescreen and the DVDs are widescreen. Why is it streaming in pan and scan?I rate the show itself ""5"" stars, but it's unacceptable that it's not being shown in its original format."
5,"Sidesplitting, ROTFLMAO, adult must see comedy","The most funny and fantastic show created, I bought all four seasons as soon as they were available. The best relationship humor out there!"
1,Painful,"Let me start off by saying I loved Seasons 1-3. I have watched them again and again, but I resisted buying Season 4 because of Jeff's absence. Finally, I caved. After all, while Jeff was a great part of the show, he was not THE show. How bad could it be?Bad. Painfully bad.I do not exaggerate here when I say I didn't laugh once. Not even a chuckle. Whereas before I would laugh until my sides hurt, Season 4 left me feeling uncomfortable. Dismayed. Wondering what had gone so wrong where everything previously had gone so right.It wasn't just Jeff being gone. The writing was off, as was the acting. The feeling of camaraderie was gone. The characters had lost their depth, and the actors delivered their lines in a way that seemed forced.I should have followed my instincts and avoided this season. Now I need to watch 1-3 to get the bad taste of season 4 from my mouth. Yuck."
5,Best Blossom Album,"Just what I said: best Blossom album. They're all great, but this one has that special sparkle to it that makes you want to listen to it over and over and over again. Her voice hugs these delicious standard and not-so-standard tunes. A true classic jazz vocal album. And do not forget she plays piano too!"
5,Small & Beautiful,"I bought these for my wife for Valentine's day and she LOVES them.The only noteworthy comment is that they are slightly smaller than the photo might suggest - the hearts are only about 1/2 of an inch high.Pros:Gold plated over silver including posts (my wife is allergic to stainless steel, so this is a must)Very nice detailNot a boring standard design, but not a weird/crazy design eitherOverall, subtle but beautifulCons:Somewhat smaller than expectedBox was adequate, but nothing to write home about.Overall, I couldn't be happier about my purchase, and neither could my wife."
4,Very pretty,"These earrings are small, delicate and very pretty. I really like them but don't purchase if expecting large jewels. Recommend wearing with backings."
5,This was a very funny Morse!,It was very fuuny and sad. Poor Morse he had to learn the hard way . And I love the music and where the flimed it!
5,Bhakta Is The Best,"Spiritual, soulful Amal Bhakta, author of The Supreme Mystic, spins an appealing portrait of a god reincarnated as a young boy, beloved by all, with talents that often baffle many, a gifted singer, dancer and musician. We give you Krishna...and for those who can't get enough, try Bhakta's MYSTICAL STORIES FROM THE MAHABHARATA and MYSTICAL STORIES FROM THE BHAGAVATAM."
5,ZOMBIES on HALLOWEEN!!!,"Sometime back in either February or March, we had a big snow storm and got out of school for a few weeks. During that time I bought a bunch of Zombie flicks such as Zombi 2, 3, 4, 5, Burial Ground: The Nights of Terror, Zombie Holocaust and FleshEater (a.k.a.) Revenge of The Living Zombies! I love this movie, not only because it's a Zombie flick, but it's a Zombie flick that takes place on HALLOWEEN, which is awesome!!! It has gore, female nudity, zombies, HALLOWEEN...what else could you possibly ask for in a horror flick! I knew how it would end because I'm so smart! The lead zombie is the cemetery zombie from George A. Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead! If you love horror, zombies, and HALLOWEEN, you'll love FLESHEATER (a.k.a.) REVENGE OF THE LIVING ZOMBIES!!!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I went in to this film expecting the worst, I was dead wrong (excuse the pun.) This movie DOES have poor acting but it also wastes no time getting to the zombies and gore. I liked it a lot. It wasn't scary, but it was cheesy, gory, and fun. I also thought the special effects weren't too bad really. Give it a try, but b4 you do, try to find it cheaper. I wouldn't pay 22.00 for it."
2,Sub-par effort!!!!!!!,"Hmmmm, I'm afraid to say that this anthology of short Doctor Who stories isn't really worth recommending. Out of the 15 stories presented here, only one was impressive. this being the 1st Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Susan story 'The Last Days' which captures the toe and characterisation of the period excellently. The rest are just mediocre stories or those that make you think ""What the hell was that all about?"" Along with stories featuring all 8 doctors, you'll find the return of the Krynoids and the Master. RECOMMENDED for the DIE-HARD fans only."
2,"Occasionally spot-on, mostly disappointing","While I admire the manner in which authors of WHO-fiction push the show's limited concepts and characters, in some cases I just don't see the point. This collection is full of examples of this. Fetuses being sucked from aliens? Bisexed water-apes? I just don't see why these concepts were important enough to be roughly married to DR. WHO. However, as with any collection, there are diamonds to be found. In my opinion, these include the 7th Doctor adventure with Krynoids, the characters are depicted to perfection. The curious ""Model Train Set"" offers an interesting comparison between the 7th and 8th Doctors. Otherwise, sorry, nothing to be enthusiastic about."
4,A quietly moving character study,"This is a nice character study about a man who has missed out on most of his son's childhood. The son is now a grown man with a wife and two kids, one of whom the grandfather tries to spend time with--though he screws that up as well, at least temporarily. Paul Newman is likeable as the troubled Sully, Bruce Willis is appropriately slimy as a cheating husband whose wife, played by Melanie Griffith, would love to take off with Sully; Dylan Walsh shows his pre-Nip/Tuck promise as the abandoned adult son of Sully; and the lovely and elegant Jessica Tandy does a nice, if brief, turn as Sully's landlady.Some language may offend a few viewers but otherwise this is a good choice for adults and seniors."
4,Herb needed to be reigned in,Great session but spoiled by Herb Ellis playing rhythm guitar too often.Uncommon and not very hip for bebop and too restrictive for the soloist.
1,too many notes,"There is a scene in the movie ""Amadeus"" where Mozart asks Frederick the Great how he liked his latest composition, and Frederick replied that it had ""too many notes"". I'm not sure what Frederick the Great didn't like, but...Bebop cutting sessions like this strike me that way, ""too many notes"". Each musician trying to play as fast and as complicated a rif as he could to prove that he could lose the other people in the group, totally losing all sense of melody or harmony. Much technique, little memorable music.Stan Getz, who could play anything and everything, consistantly tried to prove that he was ""not a feather-light stylist"" but rather a ""stomping tenor man"".There are many better more representational and truly Stan Getz recordings like ""Anniversary"", ""Blue Sky"", ""Spring is Here"", ""Nobody Else but Me"" ""Ballads and Bossa"" ""Focus"" etc etc. See my list on this page."
5,Tough Enough Is a Must Have For Real Viking Fans,Tough Enough To Be Vikings is a comprehensive book that cronicles the history of the Minesota Football Vikings. I refer to it all season long to enhance the current season by tying it to the past. I am buying it as Christmas gifts for all my football fan family and friends. Great coffee table book!
5,VERY GOOD MUSIC...,"i just picked this up and i am so glad i found it. this is some great punk rock. better than most stuff you hear today, and a lot better than most of the punk you hear on Epitaph (i did notice that Hellcat, although part of epitaph, has much better music than Epitaph does!). I think only Rancid and NOFX even come close to this. it's got grinding guitars, harsh vocals, banging drums...and a bass somewhere in there. really good music.i can't belive i didn't notice the connection between Brody Armstrong and Tim Armstrong. good for him! she seems like quite a catch."
4,"not as good as singsingdeathhouse/coralfang, but still","my favorite distillers album is sing sing death house, and this self-titled debut is even more hardcore punk sounding than sing sing...(which is a bit hard to beleive, eh?)i definetly recamend this if you like the distillers/punk or music in general, very worth it"
1,No longer can purchase filters for this product!,"I have had this product for a year, and really like it, however you can no longer find the replacement odor filters. I called Graco and was told they no longer make them. Of course it works without the filter, but there is a BIG difference in containing the smell! My other complaint, now that I have a toddler, he loves to open & close this pail and put toys & other items in it!"
5,Parodies For The Thinking Person,"""Jesus Christ Morningstar"" is a brilliant CD that uses ""serious"" parodies to tell the story of the life of Christ and also defend the inerrancy of Scripture, the Resurrection and other doctrines of the Christian faith.In my opinion, the best parodies are (in no particular order):""Parable Guy (parody of ""American Pie"" by Don McClean), ""You May Be Bright (parody of ""You May Be Right"" by Billy Joel), ""Fakey Shakey Parts (parody of ""Achy Breaky Heart"" by Billy Ray Cyrus), ""Died and Rose"" (parody of ""China Grove"" by the Doobie Brothers) and ""John 1:1"" (parody of ""Fun, Fun, Fun"" by the Beach Boys). Other parodies on the CD include parodies of ""Hotel California"", ""Stairway to Heaven"", and the ""Friends"" theme song.Each parody has brilliant lyrics that help bring you closer to Christ and successfully challenge the false doctrines taught by liberal theologians, all while your enjoying great music. This CD is highly, highly, highly recommended."
4,Shogun - Still an all-time great series!,"Next to Roots, I think Shogun is probably one of the all time best mini-series to show up on television. It's a faithful rendition of James Clavell's book and packs a lot of action, intrigue and character development. My only negative comment is there are no English subtitles for the copious amounts of Japanese spoken in the program. I often felt left out of the story when this occurred. But, in total, this is a great show and well worth watching again and again!"
4,Not the complete original,"Just be aware that this is not the complete, original mini-series. The original was 12 hours long, with little translation. This version is 4 hours shorter with overly dramatic translated narration. This is the one you can catch on TV now and then. The complete original, I believe, only aired once. Wish they would make it available."
3,Not as good as the book,This was a very good series but had alot missing from it. I'm not saying that you shouldnt go out and buy it(for all means do) but before or even after you have seen it please read the book. Sure it might be long but it will go so fast you will wish that there were 1152 more pages to it. Heck I read it in less that two weeks.
3,Shogun-the miniseries,This movie started out pretty intense but as the movie went on it began to slow down.There were a lot of great charaters in this movie.The thing the viewer has to get used to is that the charaters speak a lot of japenese so you have to pay attention to what is being said or you will lose the story.The movie itself was well made the the ending was a disappointment but I would still recommend people to watch it.
5,Loved It!,"Had the thought, ordered the dvd spent the whole day watching it. Always been one of my favorites! Richard Chamberlin has always been the king of the mini-series!"
4,James Clavell's Shogun,"Very good service. Excellence product, my husband was very surpized that I could get the set. He had loaned his to a friend and never got it back."
5,Mesmerizing story,"Shogun is one of the best adaptations of a literary bestseller to the small screen. Superb acting, great scenery and great suspense story.Too bad that one of the 5 discs is flawed. The picture stalls and there is no way to continue watching unless the skip button is used causing that a considerable part of the film is not possible to view."
2,Okay,Arrived very quickly but found it was a bit more beat up than I expected and there was someone had written all through out the book. I won't exactly described the condition good as it was labeled.
4,I am an interior trim carpenter,Nice tool over all only complaint is that they chip apart after awhile. Every painter should own one of these too.
3,Interesting but not great.,"I enjoy reading non-fiction books like this, a book I would put in the same category as ""Cod"" and ""Salt"" by Mark Kurlansky or ""Wind"" by Jan Deblieu. While there was lots of interesting stuff in ""At Day's Close"", I thought Ekirch didn't do a great job of tying it together. I thought Kurlansky did better along those lines with ""Cod"" and ""Salt"". Another thing that bothered me about ""At Day's Close"" was his focus on Europe and North America. I think it would have been more interesting if Ekirch had compared European attitudes with those of other cultures."
3,Queensryche sells out,"Queensryches previous album Operation Mindcrime came with a sticker that said "" heavy metals version of Pink floyd""...meaning the the band was innovative , edgy and topical. So what do they do on thier next album Empire? Put out another innovative album ? No ... they remake Comfortably Numb and call it Silent Lucidity . This album ,unlike its predecessors Mindcrime and Rage, is filled with radio / MTV friendy pop songs like Jet City Woman , Sweet Della Brown and the aforementioned Lucidity . This album paved the way for the mediocrity that was to come.. Promise Land , Hear in the Now Frontier , Q2K and Tribe. Its just really sad to see a band with so much of an upside fizzle to mediocrity."
4,good introduction to bamboo,"Very readable, as you would expect from gierech.... but also very short. I got the impression he knocked this one out over a cup of coffee. Having said that, it's fired me with the enthusiasm to fish bamboo in the uk. The fillers at the end on bamboo rod builders & dealers are not as complete as a quick search on the net will provide... which is probably exactly what he did.Worth reading because his enthusiasm & philosophy shines through... but expect to finish reading it in a couple of hours!"
1,Terrible Self-Help Book,"Maybe if you have an instructor holding your hand you can figure out how to use the information in this book. Don't buy it if your trying to learn it yourself, what a waste of $."
1,"""Childs play is the worst!!!!!!!!""","I think childs play is the most terrible movie of all! I got nightmares from this movie. The doll,chucki is a very evil thing. Id rather watch nightmare on elm street! I hope that who ever did this movie feels guilty, and I am warning kids under 11 to not see this horrer film! I am only 10 years old!"
5,Lovedit,Funny and suspenseful silly also frightening good movie over all I hope to see the rest of the sires pease
5,It's about time...,"Why it took this many years for the distributors to put out a widescreen disc of this film is beyond me... Thankfully, they finally wised up. And it was great to hear that they would also be including a slew of extra features as well.This is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, so I'm glad that it's getting the treatment it deserves... even if it did take 10 years."
3,Child's Play,"Compared to later sequels and as of this writing a ""Reboot"" of the original to make it scary again,this movie gets 3 in a half to 4 stars. It was scary as a little kid but has lost some of it's luster as time has passed. I wouldn't go off and call it a classic,but it isn't a movie that should be neglected."
4,Sea Dogs 2 aka Age of Pirates: Caribbean Tales,"A pretty aweful game out of box, with patches as well as the fan created Super Patch, it's actually a very fun, if somewhat repetitive game. You sail around the Caribbean undertaking randomly generated quests, or following the shallow storyline, THEN undertaking randomly generated quests or simply sailing from port to port trading goods.Though really....what more do you want? The officer system is interesting, and the ship handling is as good as to be expected. Without the Super patch, there's many many crashes and the graphics are pretty hohum, but with it, it's actually a very nice looking game with smooth gameplay and greatly reduced loading times.It's very very similar to Sid Meier's Pirates, though each have things that the other does better."
2,"Decent for youth and under-educated, but...","Ms Rach seems to have tried a bit too hard to write a book for youth but seems to think you talk down to them.A fine try and the book does have a good deal of specific information but the detail is in all the wrong places to be of much interest to me.Better to buy THE AFRICAN GREY PARROT HANDBOOK, or KEEPING AFRICAN GREY PARROTS."
1,general parrot care for beginners,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping to find information specific to the African Grey, but instead found a very simple book that was a guide to basic parrot care. Most information in this book applies to any parrot species. I did not find any useful information unique to African Greys beyond the description of the species and the Eurocentric history of parrot keeping.This is not a helpful book. Try the Guide to a Well Behaved Parrot for general information, and African Grey Parrots, by the same author.This book was an utter waste of time and money. I feel the title is misleading.It was also upsetting that the author outright discouraged adopting preowned parrots, and encouraged play with dangerous toys - nuts and bolts and rope. If you get nuts and bolts or rope toys for your parrot please make sure they are made from bird safe material so your lovely parrot companion doesn't die from metal poisoning or strangulation."
3,A mix of classicism and romanticism,"Many music historians consider Symphony #4 or #5 as Glazunov's best orchestral work. It is for this reason I bought this CD. Both symphony #5 and #8 are good, but neither I believe is as good as #1 or #6. Both of the symphonies here sound like a hybrid of the romantic and classical styles of Classical music. A good example of this is the final movement of symphony #5. Like the last movement of Beethoven's 9th symphony, it starts of with a traditional classical feel, and cascades into an emotional final more appropriate of the romance style. Though enjoyable music, nothing on this album really stands out, or sticks in the head as great music."
3,Decent,"The book for the sake of the tales contained in it is good. But, the main reason I bought it was for the illustrations by Edmund Dulac. This is a much newer reprint and does not have all of the original illustrations. One redeeming quality of this book is that the few illustrations which are included are fairly high quality."
4,Stepcore Lives!,"The Step Kings are yet another band into the foray of the rap-metal/hardcore genre. However, they're not just another band. Most songs are really powerful and successfully mix hardcore & melody to make for a different type of sound. I've seen these guys in concert, and they are a powerful live group as well. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.Best Tracks: Imbalance, Independence Day, Get It!,"
2,Resolutely superficial,"Frederick Exley was perhaps the quintessential one-book wonder, though he did write a few decent magazine articles along the way. A Fan's Notes is a terrific read and deserves the accolades it has received from Yardley and others. But Yardley is the wrong guy to write a biography of Exley. He is so obtusely literal and middle-brow that he does something I would have thought impossible: make Exley boring. Maybe Nick Tosches should have a crack at this subject. His hallucinatory method would be far more apt than Yardley's plodding fact-after-fact approach."
5,EXCELLENT,"Jonathan Yardley has scored with this very readable story of a very different man's life. Frederick Exley (author of A FAN'S NOTES)is someone who would normally be hard to write three paragraphs about - but a whole book? Yes. And with style. MISFIT isn't a full-blown biography, it is a story of a man's life without learning where his grandparent's were born, etc. Yardley gives us much insight into an author who hit the long ball with A FAN'S NOTES and then well.....after reading this book, you'll know why that was the only book in him. Exley authored two other novels, but they are hardly worthy to be mentioned in the same review as Yardley's MISFIT. My suggestion - unless you are a huge Exley fan, read A FAN'S NOTES and then read MISFIT. Then if you feel you must, read the other two - but don't miss this one."
2,"By the time you hear track two, you've heard the whole thing!","Okay to drop in while you're preoccupied with something else, like backgroung music for laundry day, or washing the car. All the tracks have the same feel & sound, the whole 'experience' is done before you know it.. leaves me feeling, 'okay, NEXT!'"
1,Worthless,"I purchased these earbuds to use when traveling. They are awkward to use, the sound is tinny with no bass whatsoever, and the noise cancellation is nonexistent. When you turn on the noise cancellation it ups the volume a bit and adds a quiet hiss, you can still hear everything going on around you. I am actually astonished at how awful these earbuds are. I was hoping for a 50% reduction in background noise, instead I have a product that is useless in any situation. Traditional earbuds are far superior. I passed the Koss earbuds on to two other people to try with the exact same results, no one wants them even for free.Bad product, bad design, waste of money."
2,Blue is in the eyes of the beholder,"Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the ""design"" of the earring. But after closer examination, I noticed that the ""blue"" stone was ""very light blue"". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your ""own"" eyes and not through fancy ""photoshop"" website with touchup/enhanced photos."
3,"okay, but not great","The stone in these earrings was very very very pale blue, almost looked like a diamond. And they are very small. I was surprised at how small they are but that is my fault for not reading the dimensions. On the plus side, they are solid and feel like good quality. The hinged loop is easy to use. I only wish the stone was darker but other than that I liked the earrings."
2,Probably The Worst Ryche Album Made,"First off let me say that I love Queensryche! Up to this album that is.I don't know what happened.The sound is totally stripped down and really does'nt sound like Queensryche at all.From the opening track when Geoff Tate bellows the words,""Hey cuckoo"",you know you're in 4A stinker.There's only two songs that are salvagable here,Hit The Black & You.Both could have been on Promised Land.I think even Chris DeGarmo felt the magic had left on this one since he departed after this release.So why write a review for a stinker? Because there are way better Ryche albums to buy.Here is a list in order of my personal favorites. Operation:Mindcrime is #1 in my opinion.Followed by Rage For Order,The Warning,Empire & Promised Land.All are great releases and way more deserving of your money."
4,Believable acting!!!,"I saw the film and the acting was beautiful. Jessica, Halle, Cuba, Joie Lee (Spike Lee's sister), et al did wonderful jobs. I even cried. I wish there were more quality films out there like this one."
2,I bit surprised,"I have to agree with the person who spoke of the profanity. I am also a Polly Horvath fan. I loved the characters and the plot, but the language and topics of some of the conversations shocked me. I kept thinking I was misreading the text. I was relieved when a librarian friend of mine shared her thoughts on the book with me. She could not believe the rave reviews the book had received, based on the content and language. Thank goodness I read it so I knew not to place it on my classroom bookshelf."
5,Thank God for the Hunt Club,"This book is about a shy girl named Ratchet who lives with a verbally abusive mother who doesn't let her have any friends. Not far into the book, her mother ships her off to stay the summer with her great-aunts in Maine.There are several little twists in the story. Another girl is dropped off at the great-aunts' house. Ratchet learns to milk the cow. Ratchet's mom finds a boyfriend. Ratchet learns of her aunt Tilly's marriage.To me, this story is about small joys in life, like gardening, milking cows, going swimming, and good people. I really liked it, but I think it's a personal thing. Also, it has the ""f"" word in it, so beware. I wouldn't want to shelter my kids from this book- this is a great story. If you're a teacher or librarian, I'd be wary of this book."
1,The Canning Season,I picked this book up for my fifth graders to read and while skimming through it I saw the F word. I was blown away that an author would put that word in a kids book. SO even if it is a good book we will not be reading it. Starr
2,Trash!,"I was lured into this by the ""golden"" sticker on the front cover. I bought two copies. Much to my good planning I read a copy and didn't just assume this would do for a birthday gift for grand kids. The two copies went in the trash! Yes, trash! Why? Profanity, luridness, Just not up to the standard of good reading!"
1,Inappropriate for young readers,"I loved Everything on a Waffle. I was appalled at The Canning Season. Within the first 50 pages, the reader is assaulted with profanity. Why would the author have thought that kind of language was appropriate for young readers? Then to make matters worse, the way the aunts drink and get drunk is unbelievable and so not appropriate for the age of the intended reader. Polly Horvath has a great writing gift and a great voice in children's literature. It's so disappointing that she has to muddy it up with profanity and drunkenness. I didn't finish the book. I planned to recommend Everything on a Waffle to my young nieces, but after reading the first few chapters of The Canning Season, I won't be recommending any of the books."
1,Not long lasting...,"So I received my cutting boards, two of them one small and one large, for a wedding gift a year ago. Just took them out of the package in March of 2011. Loved them at first but they soon began to fall apart. both boards started cracking. My smaller one of the two completely cracked in half reduring it useless, and I am not waiting for the bigger one to fall apart also. My family has always gotten Chicago Cutlery for weddings gifts, but maybe this will be the last time getting their accessories. Hands down the knives are great, but also under warranty, whereas the cutting boards are not no matter how long or short time you have had them from. Nothing lasts forever, but cutting boards lasting under 6 months???? Will not buy or give again."
4,It could be better.,"Yeah, it's a good player. But it could be even better if designers put a ""pause"" button on the remote control."
2,NOT as LARGE as stated,"First of all, I own three Coolaroo window shades and am pleased with their quality and performance; however, this shade sail is far smaller than stated in the description. I did not measure but estimated shade to be around 9' give or take 6"". I wanted to cover a frame that just happens to be 11' 8"", and this shade fell light years short of reaching that dimension. Another reviewer described a similar complaint prior to my purchase, but I chose to ignore that review thinking he or she was mistaken or possibly received a defective shade. Nevertheless, he or she was right so, learn from my mistake; if you need more than 9-ish feet look elsewhere. If actual dimensions are not a concern, then experience tells me you will probably be pleased with the quality."
1,Only software that makes TurboTax look good,"For several years up to 2002, I used TurboTax from Intuit - both the business and personal editions. Using TurboTax has been a pretty sucky semi-manual process that I've never been happy with. Believing some erroneous reviews (thanks for nothing Walt Mossberg from the WSJ), I vented my frustration by using TaxCut this year. It is horrific. It probably would have been easier to do my business returns by hand (even with having to look up calculations for depreciation). The other reviews cover most of the probs: it starts with trying to update the program and having it crash, continues through worksheets where you have to manually enter info that has already been entered elsewhere and a completely unintegrated (nonexistent?) help system, and ends where I had to go to the IRS and CA FTB sites to find the addresses to mail the reurns to."
1,1 lbs. round cheese,"What you really have here is, too much money and a need to, throw some of it away to pay this price... Give me a break - $25.00 for 1 lbs. of Wis. Cheddar cheese.? I am not saying anything at all against Wisconsin Cheese, it's great stuff! Just not worth $25.00 a pound no matter where it's made or comes from..."
1,Does it deserve a star rating?,"Does this deserve a star rating? NO. It is bland, uninteresting, without descriptive text to bring characters to life. There are so many wonderful books who do this genre justice..... Leave this one alone."
4,My son loves it,"My 6 year old loves mechanical stuff and when he saw this clock in a store, he had to have it. It works fine. The gears visibly move. You are not supposed to set the time by moving the hands, but that is what you are tempted to do. Just have watch out. The only issue was there were two tiny bolts loose in the box. I couldn't find where one went, but the other was to hold the minute hand in place. This fell off again later. You need to keep an eye on it."
3,Ok slip for sleeping,I was looking for something comfortable and easy for sleeping and lounging. I should have looked more closely at the material composition because this is a very shiny polyester. I guess I was expecting more of a cotton feel. Still it fits pretty well and was not expensive so I'll keep it. The waist is not fitted though as it appears to be in the photo. Its cut straight and the straps are not adjustable.
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of four] One of Chuck Nossis best ever!,"Norris, Karen Carlson and Lee VanCleef are outstanding in this sortof Martial Arts / Revenge modern daytale, which crosses over several genres!Van Cleef fans will especially love it.Some dialog is sort of silly in here asone guy in Martial Arts camp calls anoriental a 'bleedin' NAZI'?! Dumb line..."
4,Excellent action at the end...living the late 70s in the beginning,"An excellent movie overall. Norris is smooth and professional, his female suitors came across as immature and lost with his guidance. The movie dates itself to the late 70s early 80s on this count. If you're a Norris fan like myself it was a excellent movie to watch especially the last 30 minutes."
3,Moderately pleased in Colorado Springs,"The book arrived in very good condition despite being poorly packaged, and having been folded in half by the postman to fit in my mailbox. It barely made it to me by the end of the month. I'll beware of this dealer in the future."
4,Gets the job done,"Since there were no other reviews I decided to guide others in their purchases. This lantern is good for someone wanting a lantern/fan combo. You can obviously find a better quality fan for the same price and a better quality lantern, but this combo gets the job done. Don't expect a ton of light coming from this, but there is enough to roughly illuminate a room or tent so you don't stub your toe. It is ideal for when the power goes out and you want some air flow when you sleep."
1,new Title systemDOESN'TWORKS,Well a bunch of utilities that do about nothing. These utilities are worth nothing. Cleansweep does the same thing windows does. Speed disk is much slower than disk defragmenter(which is all that it does) the new goback which is one of the reasons that i got it is a step back from all previous versions of goback and tends to forget many things. The firewall is ok but why pay for it when you can get a much better firewall from zonealarm.com for FREE!! Some tools can be useful but they have never actually solved any of my windows problems. You can get all the seperate utilities on this package for free or very [inexpensive] from other companies.
5,wonderful book but arrived with last page torn out,"I loved this version of the book when I was a child and was excited to find it on Amazon. I have a 7 month old who is just starting to become interested in books. I ordered what was supposedly a brand new copy of the book and when it arrived, the last page was torn in half down the middle. I could have returned it but didn't feel like dealing with the hassle.The story itself is great and whimsical. I read it to my son to the tune of the song."
2,"Good to see whats around, Bad for developers",Not a bad book for Bioinformatics users who want to see what is around but this kind of information dates very rapidly.Not a very good book for people interested in developing for bioinformatics (although it may prevent you from reinventing the wheel)
4,"yeah, this one is good too","Brooks makes this one very lighthearted as well, which is nice. The friendship between Abernathy and the earthling is a very cool touch. Poor dragon by the way. The plot is fun and always very original. It is nice that Brooks keeps you wondering until the very end. Read it."
1,"Sorry, Stan","This is the most painful review I have ever given! Stan you are a GOD! I have loved you from the very first note I heard you play. I own every record of yours I can afford. When you came to Albuquerque, played with the UNM Concert Band(!) and performed the music written for you in tribute to the four little girls killed in the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, I cried along with the rest of the audience.Caveat: I only listened to the samples on the Amazon page, but I will not buy this album. Stan, your playing is as astonishing as ever but I can't get past the annoying organ. Organists have multiple keyboards and sounds and electronic effects. Please tell me why all organists always sound the same - every note, every chord, every song, every player. All I can think of when hearing ""jazz"" organ is my home-town roller rink. If that makes me sound like a musically illiterate bumpkin so be it. Zero Stars. Sorry, Stan. Please forgive me."
3,OK if you like out of the ordinary,"Turkish delight itself is an acquired taste, but these were a little more out of the ordinary than usual. Unless you like unusual, would not recommend, but otherwise no problems with service."
2,"TaxCut is ""kids league"" compared to Turbo Tax Deluxe","I wanted to switch from Turbo Tax to TaxCut because of Intuit's registration process. I purchased but plan to return TaxCut because it dosen't have the ""interview"" features that Intuit - TurboTax does. TaxCut may work fine for someone who has a couple W-2's and maybe a schedule D. But if you have much more, you'd better get TurboTax. Especially if you want advise and not just a blank tax form - like the 4835 is on TaxCut - no interview."
1,Don't use Tax Cut if you have to file an Oregon State return,"Last year I used Turbo Tax and was able to file my state return electronically. This year I switched to Tax Cut and it doesn't support E-filing the Oregon State return. Now, at the last minute, I have to print and file a manual return. This will add about 2 months to the time it takes to get a refund. Next year it's back to Turbo Tax, no matter how bad it is, it's better than Tax Cut."
1,"Buggy, Does not do what is promised; Support is useless;","After I have removed some previously entered Schedule D transactions it still prints security name on the printed forms. The same forms printed ""not for filing"" or displayed on the screen do not have these records, so there is no way to remove this garbage.Investors/Traders who have wash sales should consider TurboTax Deluxe rather then TaxCut Platinum.Product integration with GainsKeeper is incomplete. TaxCut is unable to import Wash Sales from GK. Transactions, which do not result in wash sales, are imported correctly.I have asked TaxCut customer support regarding integration with GainsKeeper. Contrary to product specification they responded that TaxCut can import data only from Quicken/MS Money, but not GK. Response to my other technical question about arranging schedule D transactions in particular order was even more useless..."
3,"It's OK, but doesn't stick nearly as well as some others","The title pretty much says it all. This stuff sticks posters to the wall decently well, but every week or so you have to ""re-form"" it in a lump and stick it back up because the poster will fall. I've definitely used better sticky tack than this, but it does work, if only for week-long periods."
2,disappointment,Not strong enough to hold posters or card stock. Leaves blue marks on the walls. I would recommend some other product.
1,Not even a little warm,"This absolutely does not keep liquids even a little warm. When you put hot water inside it you can feel the heat on the outside of the container, that should not happen if there is insulation. Terrible! Not what I expected."
4,Great Book,This is a great book on the subject of impotence. I am an 8 year Prostate Cancer survivor and this book tells it like it is. Virginia and Keith are to be commended for sharing the intimate details of their recovery.This is great information for anyone dealing with the effects of prostate cancer. It provides a roadmap for working through the side effects of most prostate cancer treatments.
3,"Good novel, but it has potential to be something special","Once you accept that there's an deep issue with the use of qualifiers, this is actually not bad at all, but boy does it ever get in the way sometimes. The story in itself is really solid and revolves around a visceral grudge, which is cool. Whenever the writer dropped his guard and weeded out his prose, it became highly enjoyable. The interactions in between Speedy and the police officer Louis being the most interesting passages sometimes. Also, Pearce Hansen has a knack for establishing a sense of place. The urban sprawl doesn't get any better than this in crime fiction. Worth a try, especially at the price it is on the Kindle Store."
5,Excellent book!,"Excellent book for physicists and engineers. Very well written and have avoided pure mathematical proofs which may not be required for engineering research!.If you plan to buy this book, it will be a good investment.!"
4,painting greeting cards in watercolor,"This book is written by a miniature artist, and many of the examples or to do projects are in a miniature format the size of a trading card-- ok if you used to doing small paintings.The section on greeting cards is well done and easy to follow. One problem is that the section that deals with mounting your paintings does not explain the use of tape or the method of dry mounting. This book appears to be written for people who are familiar with water color painting. Good book for ideas and as reference."
2,norton personal firewall 2001 was a lot better.,"If you're just a plain home user who do not want to bother customizing your personal firewall's policy, this is the firewall for you.On the other hand, if you would rather have a mix of a smart firewall that also gives you the flexibility of fine tuning rules to your needs.... open certain ports (tcp or udp), let certain applications access the internet,... this software can be a bit confusing.Though the 2002 version lets you do it, it takes a lot more extra steps for one to customize the packet filtering which is a total pain. The 2001 version is a lot more flexible and geared towards the more ""savvy"" user.This is one of the few products that pretty much isn't worth an upgrade if you have an earlier version.On the plus side, functionality is great, it provides good protection and a simple interface."
1,Replace it,"The 2002 firewall creates problems with so many other types of software and internet applications that you may want to think about installing ZoneAlarm's wonderful product instead. I uninstalled Norton's 2002 firewall with great difficulty (call the company, get an uninstall key). I still use Norton for antivirus protection."
4,Cyndi Lauper,"Cyndi Lauper returns for her second appearance in the ""Money Changes Everything"" episode. Proving she could act as well as she can sing, she won an Emmy Award for this role."
1,Better hope you don't need support.,"TaxCut provides support via a long-distance number (Dallas, TX) not an 800 number. Their tech support online is useless unless you just need some hand holding. They promise e-mail Tech support in 48 hrs, but my request took over a week to get a non-satisfactory reply. I wanted to return this for a refund, you'll also find they make that difficult.On a side note, if you were leaving TurboTax because of the spyware/spam associated with it, TaxCut may not be a good choice either. Read their privacy policy, they will sell your information to third parties."
1,"can't beat pencil, paper, and calculator","Using the CA edition. I have used TurboTax in the past and was used to them asking me questions to see if a tax rule applies to me. Many times, TaxCut State has just referred me to the CA instructions (not always included electronically), which makes me wonder why I even bought the software. The help system is substandard. For example in the interview, ""California provides special credits and acceleration write-offs which may cause the basis of an asset to be different for California and federal depreciation."" That sounds lovely, but the help system does not explain these special differences and I can find nothing explaining them on the California government tax sites. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that I don't get audited."
4,Easy as pie,"The only ""glitch"" I encountered was at the final error check. The program told me I failed to enter the date of my return, even though I followed each process exactly as the program instructed. The program just failed to ask me (or recognize) what date I was filing my return. Once that entry was manually made, it was clear sailing again. I have used TaxCut software for the past 6 years and have been very pleased with how easy it is to prepare my returns."
3,Not what I expected,"The questions do not follow the USMLE format.Not a bad book; however, there are many better options at the same price."
1,"Good joke, Symantec! ""Ghost""...a ""phantom"" product.","Thanks for making me waste money and about 30 hours of time trying to get this to work. When I finally managed to get two computers connected (don't even bother with trying to get a CD burner connected) I found out Ghost recognizes NTFS drives only if they are the drives you are copying FROM...not TO. Sounds like something the documentation could have mentioned instead of a sly remark telling you that the available destination drives will be those that ""Ghost detects"". Brilliant! I gave 1 star because Amazon didn't let me give 0."
2,Urgent Quotation,"Hi,please send me a quotation for the Norton Ghost 2002 or for the best disk imaging product that you would advise me to use on the local network.Waiting for an urgent response.regards,Flo"
2,Symantec Decides to Punish its customers,"In general, Ghost is a fabulous piece of software, in particular, I am thinking about Ghost 2001. I was excited to see that 2002 was released and that it supported XP. I owned the software for about 20 minutes before I returned it. Symantec has a ""new license procedure"" where you have to write down a long serial number (15 digits I think) that shows up on the splash screen, and then type that number in the next screen that requests it (and no, copying and pasting is not allowed, nor is there a switch where you can manually bypass or enter the license number). I suppose Symantec's idea was to annoy people using the product to Ghost multiple machines into buying the Enterprise version. Regardless, it is silly exercise of writing and typing that legitimate customers shouldn't have to endure. I hope Symantec wises up.Overall, unless you are needing support for XP, stick with Ghost 2001."
5,Primitive future alien funk,"I discovered this after discovering the song Fifty Yards of Soul on the stellar albumRaw Funkand learned about the Whitefield Bros. Fifty Yards is in my opinion one of the strongest funk numbers of all time -like one reviewer said, if you're not moving to it you're dead.This album however, is on an entirely different plane. These songs have the same elements - stripped back sound, ridiculous beats, Meters-like interplay - but is much deeper, experimental in its rawness, almost trancelike funk. It sounds both primitive and futuristic. Very fun to sink into after multiple listenings. Wow."
5,Review on Acceptance,"I received the book ""Homeward, Angel"". Thank you. The book is a little beatup but will suffice nicely. I have to give a report of this book at my book club. I will be trying to pull up any information I can get to help me with my report.If you have any suggestions, I will appreciate all I can get. I would love to have some questions that I can ask after my report. Patricia H. Snyder"
2,Ma & Pa Kettle meet Walt Whitman,"There is some undeniably fabulous writing in this book...the opening sequence had me in love and I anxiously looked forward to the rest, but instead it lead to an overworked tedium of mundane antics punctuated by moments of brillance. It seems to me he would have been more effective in getting to the heart of the American experience in poetry rather than novel. And more concise too."
1,DISAPPOINTED,THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD QUALITY KNIFE AS MOST ARE BY THIS MFG..BUT IT PROVED TO BE A CHEAP VERSION.
1,A Stinker!,"This movie was so obviously a stinker. Hey guys, were we watching the same movie?? Between the virtually non-existent plot to the incredibly poor acting this movie just never got off the ground for me. Like some of the other reviewers, I was attracted to the movie because of Elisha Cuthbert who is stunning and can act (I loved her work in the 24 series) However, even her dialogue is purile in this bomb. While these themes could have been the basis for an interesting movie, it fails in almost every respect. I am being generous with the one star."
1,NY Times Expert Melvin Gold,This movie was so bad that the dialoge was actually comical. I can not believe that the filmmakers can make an honest living taking money from the people who pay their hard earned money to hope to get a chance to see their favorite actresses and actors in such a bad movie. Save your money and watch something that is a true work of art instead of some junk put out to capitalize on the names of the performers.
3,Okay,The movie was okay. It is a movie that one would watch on a boring Friday night. That's how I found it.
5,highly recommended,"Dark of the Gods combines two books (God Stalk and Dark of the Moon) which are the first in a fun & original series of, so far, three books. Chaos and destruction dog the footsteps of the main character in a dark, whimsical, cheery sort of way. This is a series worth buying two copies of, one for lending to friends."
4,Pretty happy with mine,I've got no complaints with mine. good all around and feel good on the head for very long periods of time. I often forget i'm wearing them after music stops.
3,OK headphones..,"1) Base is not great and/or deep.2) Headphones begin to hurt after continuos use, even after several attemps to strech them outOther than those two problems, They are completely satisfactory for what they are listed as, and for the price. 3 stars given to two problems(in my eyes)."
1,boring.,"I love Richard Bach...but this book for me just seemed to lose all momentum in about 3 pages or so. I 'get it', and I didn't need to read more fantasy about it."
1,Wish I Did Not Buy This,I really just wanted to use this product while giving my nephew a sponge bath instead of bathing him in the sink. So to test this out I put it on my couch and then put my nephew on it and he kept sliding down it. Thank God I did not put him in this thing in the sink before I tested it out. I just went ahead and bought an infant tub. I dont know what I am going to do with this thing. I know it does not cost much but I think you would do better to buy an infant tub with a sling.
4,Good defense of the AV,"I thought this well-written, well-documented book had some good arguments in favor of the AV. It brought up some points defending the AV that I had not read before, and should be a must read for those interested in this issue. Don't let your bias for modern versions deter you from reading this book. It is well balanced and any Christian who claims to be seeking the truth should at least read it."
2,Not as good as TurboTax,"I chose Taxcut this year because of the spyware Turbotax was installing with their software. You know what? I don't do anything wrong (pirate, illegal copies) with the software anyway so what's the difference? Anyway, I miss TurboTax. Taxcut is not very helpful in guiding me through complex forms (itemized deductions, proporty tax stuff). In fact, I could not get any interview guidance with writing off my home office until I went in and manually began filling out the form. After that is when I could use the interview process.The help in Taxcut is very primitive. When I got stuck within a form and clicked on the help button, it took me to the page, ""Getting help with Taxcut"". Not useful at all.I look forward to TurboTax next year."
1,Pain!,"Why should it be such a pain in the neck to use tax program!? I paid money for TaxCut, so i can file easily and save my time and energy. It messed up and i either have to start over (grrr...) or file paper forms. I miss old good TurboTax when it didn't have spyware yet."
3,Watch out for the rebate,"The software is fine. But beware of the traps in getting a customer rebate if you download the H&R Block deluxe edition, as I did. The rebate forms are hidden in pdf format in the Taxcut folder. When you print out the state rebate form, it tells you to send to the address below but does not provide the address.. you have to call H&R Block. The address for the state rebate is: H&R Block Rebate Center, Dept. 420564, Promo No. 763021, P.O. Box 9900, Maple Plain, Minnesota 55592. This is such an obvious ploy, I would complain if I knew the right authority."
3,Microsoft Money imports work (sort of),"Although the ads state that TaxCut can ""seamlessly import your financial data from ... Microsoft Money"" the fact is it is neither seamless nor complete. For the past couple of years the automatic import has not worked and one has to consult the TaxCut webpage for a workaround. Also not all data is imported, e.g. for stock sales the name, cost basis and sale price was imported but buy and sale dates weren't. Customer service says these must be input manually because only ""basic information"" can be imported (dates aren't basic?!). If you have 75 transactions as I do this is very tedious.Overall, an okay package but my enthusiasm is greatly reduced due to the fact that it doesn't live up the ads."
1,don't buy this product,"I tried TaxCut this year after years of using Turbo Tax. It turne d out to be a massive exercise in frustration. I was prompted to get the latest tax forms, and the download locked up. Tech support told me to update my Windows XP, which took hours. Result: download still locked up. Then tech support told me that I had to de-install Internet Explorer 6.0 and get an older, obsolete version of Explorer to do the download. Degrade my system in order to get files for their program, which they should have fixed over a year ago? No, thanks!Instead of saving time with TaxCut, I wasted 10 hours (and waited two days for tech support), and missed a filing deadline for college financial aid for my daughter. My recommendation: DON'T buy this program."
1,No customer support,"I have been using Turbo Tax for many years, but because of the spyware installed with it and because of the reviews I read of this product, I decided to try Tax Cut this year. It specifically states in all the information that you can import information from last years turbo tax form into tax cut....but guess what. It doesnt work. I wrote customer support and asked them about the probelem and how to fix it....and their response was ...""I understand your frustration. I recommend that you update Turbo Tax.""It sure doesnt sound as if they want my business. I will probably use the product this year because I have already paid for it.....but next year, I doubt it. And I definitely would not recommend it."
3,"I have to agree - not a great program, but no spyware","I used TurboTax for years but switched last year after a problem getting a promised rebate from them. I tried TaxCut and found it difficult and confusing. This year I considered buying TurboTax again, only to find that they're now installing Spyware on computers as part of the installation. So I guess I'll go with TaxCut. Beats doing taxes manually at least."
1,Stick with Turbotax,"I have used turbotax for the past few years but switched to taxcut because of product activation. Well, what a mistake! I had numerous problems with software and tried to contact technical support. Standard answer, contact tax advisor for 19.95. Then after e-filing for many years with turbotax, I cannot with taxcut since I live in New Jersey and work in New York. The tax software cannot figure out that my income is taxed in both states and doubles my federal income on the New Jersey 1040 form. As such I owe NJ $2000 instead of my $600 refund. To correct this, I have to override the software which prevents e-file. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE STICK WITH TURBOTAX!!"
1,Michael Gish,"Hank Williams would've run from the room screaming and clawing his face upon hearing this dreadful representation of Hank Williams and his music...complete orchestration to represent the out of meter raw country blues of Hank williams...how terribly misapplied...a poor clumsy attempt to cross over and appeal to the undeserving elitist pop music crowd...and it is surprizing Hank Williams Jr. would be part of documentary that failed miserably in providing insight to Hank's angst...it was disappointing to seemingly be ashamed of blues driven hillbilly music...the better DVD documentary is ""Hank Williams"" Honky Tonk Blues...."
3,An old TV Special,"I have watched about half of this, and may not finish watching it. It is an old TV Special, and if you like old TV specials then you will probably like this, too. The only good thing about it I can tell you is the price was right."
1,Do not buy this software,"With the recent improvements in the security settings in MS Internet Explorer 6.0, many of the features of this software (e.g., cookie blocking) have become redundant. The remaining major feature, ad blocking, is useful but not worth the price of the software.Moreover, the software lacks several functions one would otherwise expect--pop-up blocking and the blocking and removal of spyware (hidden programs that, once downloaded onto your system, report back personal information to whoever installed them).Of particular concern is the fact that this program pre-approves ads provided by certain information-gathering companies, without bothering to tell you. (Improves the bottom line, you know!) To find and remove these sites, you have have to go to ""Options--Internet Security--Advanced Options--Ad Blocking"" and remove them individually.""But didn't I buy this software to eliminate that kind of problem?"", you ask. Exactly my point."
1,Doesn't work as advertised.,"This software is junk, and in six months of use has never worked as advertised. The anti-virus and firewall protection are marginally acceptable, but the ad trashcan function has never worked and the parental control function fails to load at least half of the time. Unacceptable performance when the primary reason for buying the software was to protect children from inappropriate content. The only thing worse than the software is the technical support. Don't even think about talking to a real person unless you want to pay them even more money, and their web-based support is even more difficult to get to work than the software."
1,All Puff,"This program was very difficult to setup for faxing with Act 2000. I live in an area that has two area codes for local dialing. This program along with Act 2000 which claims to do an area code overlay doesn't work and the instructions (which are not clearly written)will confuse you even more. Forget, customer support each company blames the next. Act blames WinFax Pro, WinFax Pro blames Windows and so on and so on and so on. After six months of trial and error, I still have mostly errors. Area code rules, overlay's etc. don't work."
3,wrong picture,"I just purchased these filters are they do not match the picture. I have owned my purifier for a couple years now and have bought several sets of replacements. This is the first time that I received filters without the additional black carbon filter. The most recent set are just the white particle filter.Yes, I know they sell several kinds of different filters, but I pulled up one of my old orders and clicked through to the product so I would expect to receive the exact same item. And not matter what, the picture shows the filter with carbon, which is definitely not what they shipped.Hopefully this is just an Amazon glitch and they will sort it out quickly because the Blueair is a great air purifier. I've never had a problem with mine and it does a great job of cleaning the air."
4,a good introduction to the subject,"This book contains abriged essays by the big names in EIL (English as an International Language)such as Kachru or Graddol. It is thus very suitable as an introduction to the subject. However, I felt that the last section did not really fit into the topic any more and was somewhat superflous. Still, the book can be well used as an awareness raising text."
1,Finger hole openings too small,I am very disappointed with these shears. I have small hands and thin fingers. I can just barely fit three fingers in a hole. I wish I hadn't thrown out the packing because I would have returned them.
4,Kitchen shears,"These shears were exactly what I was looking for, they are comfortable to use and they come apart easily for cleaning."
3,Fair pair of shears,"The blades are sharp, but they are a little loose. I think that's the price I have to pay for easy-to-clean, come-apart scissors. I believe similar quality scissors can be had for about half the price."
5,Must have for every kitchen,"I've owned these shears for a couple of years now and also bought a pair for a friend after an unfortunate episode trying to butterfly a duck with a dull filet knife. They're essential for any kitchen, in my opinion - sturdy, reliable, easy to clean, and super useful. I especially like the screw-top opener feature on the handles; metal teeth that you can clamp around a stubborn screw top to ease it open. You won't regret buying these!"
2,Very Tight Shears,Wusthof 5558-1 ShearsWhere the shears overlap near the connector is very very tight and most difficult to open or close. Nothing I've tried to loosen them works.
5,"Nope, no biscuits!","I think most people use these for cooking, perhaps making biscuits or forming layered goodies. Not me! Nope, I use it to cut out clay bottoms for my vases and mugs. I can also use it for cutting clay circles of all sizes for my pottery. The set works very well, sturdy enough to handle cutting through the clay easily. If I use a little cornstarch on the clay or some plastic wrap, I have no sticking at all. Other times, I won't and can use the stainless steel round to transport the clay circle from my slab roller table to my construction table. They clean easily and I simply LOVE the steel storage container that keep them all together!"
4,A Great CD!,"When Im playing Warcraft I pop this cd in. It goes right along with the game! It's almost like a soundtrack. The beginning of this album kicks ass. A semi classical piece with some spoken lyrics, ""Your time has come. A storm is coming, our storm. And when it arrives it will shake the universe."" and BAM into track 2. A high octane fast paced song that just rocks. This is what this kind of metal is about. High octaine music followed by high pitch lyrics about the Renaissance era. Good schtuff here!"
5,"A very, very funny book! Had me laughing out loud!","There are so many different aspects of cultural differences between America and the UK that one does not know where to start, however if you want to read one of the funniest collections of them, read this book. It really is a laugh out loud roll on the floor kind of book.So many stories that you must read it, it put me in the mind of PG Wodehouse, and his great wit, and satire.I just read a couple of his and it put me in the mood for Brit-Think!The Man With Two Left Feet And Other Stories: A British Humor ClassicThe Man Upstairs: A British Humor ClassicThe Little Nugget: A British Humor ClassicEnjoy any of these for a great laugh!"
4,Just plain fun,"This short, biting, tongue in cheek satire does not necessarily pick original targets: bad teeth, the royal family, food, clothing, temperature, sex, etc. This is no small matter as Walmsley gleeflully creates a super fast and light read highlighting the many differences existing on both sides of the pond. An American married to a Brit herself, Walmsley has experienced first hand all the dichotomous behaviors seperating us from our former landlords. My favorite chapter focuses on our respective perceptions and reactions to Death. In this particular chapter, Walmsley hits her target like a SAS (or SEAL) sniper.This is not great literature, it is just simply plain fun as well as required reading for any true card carrying Anglophilic American patriot like myself. A pure harmless (and highly affordable!) way to spend an hour or pass the time on a transatlantic flight."
5,"It's a HUMOR book, y'all ....","As a Brit married to a Yank, I had to laugh at a few of the customer reviews below. Some people seemed to be very seriously expecting a guide about how to avoid horrible breaches of business etiquette. Just because it has 'Survival Guide' in the title..... lighten up!Admittedly, it probably is a little dated. I was given my treasured, tattered copy a number of years ago by an Anglophile Yank, and laughed my head off at the very accurate observations. I suddenly understood why my American friends thought I had a 'poor self-image' - they take all that self-depracating humor seriously!"
3,Delightful.,"I.Q. is a sweet and charming romantic comedy, I am a sucker for these types of films, they all have the same formula but they are satisfying. Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins have wonderful chemistry, you root for them to end up together, and Walter Matthau is a hoot as ""Albert Einstein."" I can see why people like this movie, check it out sometime."
3,Lightweight but funny,"Walter Matthau, as Einstein, easily steals the show as he tries to persuade his niece to ditch the brilliant, boring, scientific nerd she's engaged to and follow her heart, which is tugging in the direction of the local auto mechanic, who has taken one look at her over the hood of her disabled car and fallen ridiculously and madly in love.Even Meg Ryan has trouble with the costuming of the 1950's era: cinched waists, twin sets, white gloves (!!), etc., and I got the feeling she was just going thru the motions of playing Meg Ryan, as only she can.Cute, but very lightweight."
5,Very cute movie,"I am a Chemistry Professor, and I know many professors like the old geezers in this show. It is a real crackup. Meg Ryan is cute in her role. Don't let the age of the movie fool you. It is still a good one to see. It is a very family friendly show, too, with no sex or foul language that would bother concerned parents. Well, there is a very strange couple of scenes where Meg's fiance - the Psychologist - is taking ""data"" by observing a screaming college kid in a small room in his research lab. It kind of makes fun of the experimental Psychologist, but as a Chemist, I thought that was funny."
5,Happy with this DVD,"I love this movie and wanted a copy for a long time. When I found it on Amazon for such a good price, I had to have it. I think the choice made for people in this movie could not have been better. Very funny and romantic.DVD arrived in great shape and right on time.J. Ray"
4,"light entertainment, suitable for seniors","Not that other age groups couldn't watch it, of course, but this is the sort of film that would suit a group of seniors. It's mild enough, lightly entertaining, with an appealing cast and a simple storyline. Walter Matthau looks and sounds much like Einstein in the role of the film's matchmaker."
2,"""Time Out"" strikes out!","Many folks rate this above Maltin's m0vie guide. Why? It has an overall tone of snotty, over-intellectualized condescension that grates on the nerves. Plus, it delights in reviewing obscure, third-world flicks no-one's heard of, nor would want to see. It doesn't have a rating system, doesn't show availability in any format, doesn't show MPAA ratings, nor does it tell you where films are available for purchase or rent. In contrast, Maltin supplies all of these. Even if you don't always agree with his evaluations, in all, he provides much better info for decision-making."
1,Disappointed in these knives,"Very disappointed in these knives. Used them when they arrived and found out they were not cutting steak very well.After looking at them closely, I noticed they did not have a good edge. I used my steel and brought the edge back up. They then cut nicely but they do not hold an edge. I have to use a steel on them after every use.I am an ex meat cutter and expect a lot more from a knife. I would not recommend these to any one."
2,does a terrible job with TV show DVDs,"When I am playing non-film content, i.e. TV Shows or hybrid content (interlaced + film), the video on the screen will flicker between most quick scene changes. I noticed it alot on ""The Shield - Seasons 1 and 2"" and on DVDs burned from Tivo content.I know its not a bad player because I have 2 of these each bought at different times and they both have this exact same problem. I have a feeling that it has a hard time with interlaced content, since all hollywood movies (film, 24fps) plays just perfect.I could not find any settings on the player to help alleviate the problem. I am using the S-Video output. I have since switched to the new Philips 642 and this DVD player plays everything great, even divx discs.NOTE: The flicker I mentioned was caused by an incorrect setting. If you set the film mode correctly then it plays fine. So in retroscpect I would give this player a 4 star rating."
4,It's Awight,"This CD has a pretty good mixture of some decent songs. The only problem is that after playing them again and again, the excitement kinda wears off of them. But if you are looking for a bit of variety to pop into the CD player and give it a few spins, then this CD will do the job fine."
5,China Beach Series needs to be on DVD,"China Beach is one of the best shows I have ever seen on television, and I miss it. I am always looking for a station to have reruns of it, however, I have not found one where I live yet.Please bring the series on DVD. I know I will be the first in line to buy it when it comes out."
3,A Dedicated lady,"Flora Annie Steel found her calling when she and her husband were sent to India. She grabbed every opportunity to portray the people and the country, serving them well. The book is a little dry and could use more color."
5,Quality Construction Set,"Bought the Erector Set as Christmas gift for a 10 year old. This is a good quality product, most parts are metal and there are no sharp edges. The assembly hardware (small nuts and bolts) are of good quality. The instructions, while they are all detailed step-by-step diagrams, are very well developed, and the 10 year old picked up the concept quickly but does need some adult assistance as we chose a rather complex project (the motorized helicopter) to start. For these building projects I think the diagrams work better than written instructions. The case is sturdy and functional. The off-forward-reverse switch is located on the battery pack making it more difficult to operate than if it were a wired remote switch."
1,So BAD Quality,Erector is great toys even i like them more than Lego. But this set is very bad quality and every part is rough. I hope Meccano to get this feedback to stop manufacturing this toy in China that makes Erector losing the soul~
3,Fun for a time,"Pretty good toy I purchased over 8 years ago for my son's birthday present. It had the same appeal to him as me, 40 years earlier. Could be better."
1,"Poor design, poor instructions.","I am very disappointed in this toy. My sons enjoy putting things together as well as taking things apart. This product is overwhelming, even for my husband who tried to ""help"" them but they quickly lost interest. There are various screws like 15/64 that you must sort through to find. There are no words used in the instructions to help you build it. I feel like we wasted our money."
1,Shipping Wrong Product,"I ordered the ""Erector Special Edition Set"" of this page but I was shipped the ""Erector Motorized Racing Car & More"" instead.What a scam!! Reading the reviews you can clearly tell that this page was offering the special edition set. There is alsostill a picture of the special edition set along with the new racing car set they are pushing on this page.I called Amazon and they wont do anything about it. The India call center hung up on me. Pretty poor customer service."
3,"Inside look good, but the case was broke","Ordered this for Christmas and the case was broken out of the box. No damage to the shipping box so it must be a defect in the plastic. Now, I can't return it because Amazon is sold out. I suppose I will jerry rig the case back together. Hopefully the parts are made better than the case. Frustrating since I paid full price for a broken toy."
5,Extremely great value added for the kids,"It is really a great added value for the kids, even for parents enjoying a joint activity with their own kids. I've used to play with the old versions as a kid, i thought to bought one of the new sets to my kids now. it adds a lot of value added for all of my kids (6, 10, 12 years old), not only of individual level, on a joint projects built by the 3 of them as well as me joining them to build the next project. the joy also came when they finished the 1st model and started recording a full documentary on how they built it and how did they reach the final model."
2,Won't buy another Stanley made in China,"Bought a new Stanley 1 liter about a year ago. It has lost its insulating properties. Real disappointing but not surprising considering where it was made. I also have an old Stanley that is 20 years old, beat up but still works like a champ."
2,Previous posters correct:,"The quality has slipped. I've owned three other Stanley Bottles used, abused, nearly crushed one, lost another. Trust me I've used these bottles nearly daily for years. Recieved a new bottle for Christmas. What a disapoinment, quality and heft gone. Not the same as my old bottle that I still have dents and all."
4,"It's not my dads, but it still works well.","I remember reading a lot of reviews about how these are horrible in comparison to how they used to be. It's true, they aren't quite as nice and don't hold heat as well, but it's still one of the BEST thermoses out there. Yeah my dad's will hold hot coffee for almost a full day, but I've gone back to mine at 5pm after making the coffee around 9am and it's still steaming hot. I also had issues with other thermoses that wouldn't fully seal or would leak, that's not an issue here at all. I'll be using this for years to come."
1,Absolute Chinese Junk,"I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA. I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is. While it may look like the old American made Stanley, it is just a veneer of it's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk. I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation. Don't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago."
1,Chinese imitation,"This thermos has the Stanley name, but not the quality. Only keeps coffee warm about 2 hours. Now made in China. Emails to Stanley went unanswered. Do not waste your money on Stanley"
5,Purchased as a Christmas gift,"I received the order very promptly. My husband has used a Stanley thermos for years and his old one finally wore out, he was very happy to get another!"
4,Great,"mine works great got it as a girt from a friend, after i bought my nissan one. i use my stanley for my coffee and my nissan for my tea. it works great even after a full day of school, of course i drink about half at school and the other half at work. this is one of those ""chinese"" made ones and it works just as well as my nissan but i can carry my stanley around and not get funny looks lol. although i do have a question to the people who did buy one of these stanleys what is the outside threads on the green area used for, a bigger cup or ? i know how production works and all that they stopped making this other part that goes on the outside, although the thermos is still made with these threads. where could i buy an after market fitting for this? the ""cup"" is a tad to small for my liking and i am sure that something can attach to these outside threads. thanks in advance! :D"
2,Not impressed,"Purchased one of these after borrowing a friends for the weekend, he had an old one he had picked up at a thrift store. The new model doesn't seem to do as good a job at keeping the liquids warm and does seem to be a bit 'cheaper' feeling. The new model was stamped made in China on the bottom, not sure what the one I borrowed said. Luckily I was able to return this and am looking at other options."
1,Stay away from CenDyne DVD drives.,"These are great if you want to burn CD's but as a DVD burner they are the best if your looking to create a coster. Check out their website aka Pioneer, the support is equally poor. Be especially weary of the DVR-104 drives."
3,WFT-E2A Review,"Although the product performed as advertised in the ethernet specification, the website (and Canon's) description failed to note that only EXTERNALLY powered disk drives may be used as a USB storage device. The pocket drives (powered by USB cable) sold by Amazon will not work, so the device is useless for external storage, unless tethered to an AC outlet - or you have a battery-powered drive (such as an image data bank, E.G. Epson 2000/4000). Also, once either the camera or the storage device 'times out', then you have to re-sync and connect them when you power back on before you can start shooting again (camera will default back to memory card at time-out) - no time for that in sports!"
3,TravelJohn for Women,I have not read one review stating how well it works for WOMEN!!! So what's the deal? How does it work - and how well does it work - for WOMEN???
1,Sorry but this is bad.,"I kept trying to like this but it just seems like athrown together mess. The sound is horrible also, howcould someone who Produced ""Universe"" produce this overcompressed garbage. I love all their other stuff, 5year wait for this? I dumped it off to the used bin.1 star for the artwork."
3,building block for a much larger story,"This story was well told just a little thin on back ground on the main players , but not bad for going in circle."
3,Background to the Lazarus Long stories.,Methuselah's Children sets the background for my favorite novels Heinlein later wrote that included 'Lazarus Long' aka the 'Senior.' The Senior is a long lifer. The longest living human on earth. The story is filed with great Characters including Long who are persecuted for the secret of their long life.
2,Boring........,"A small book about a sweet, old man... May be pictures in it should make up for the lack of the story. It was so boring I could not finish reading this 50 pages book."
1,Crushed bike,"The title speaks for itself, I figure i would try one more time getting something from amazon, and I was right the product was damaged, the fenders were bent and tires did not want to go on, can not say how the bike would be, but looking at the frame would say better off going somewhere else for a bike, plus you need to try the bike before you buy them, don't make the same mistake, take your money else where"
5,Another great album by a great band.,"Forget all the ""true fan"" and other nonsense talk in other reviews.The fact is that this is a great album by a great band. If you like light-crunchier power chord-driven emotional rock with great melodies and catchy riffs, then this is for you. If not, go elsewhere.I don't think one song qualifies as ""filler"" on this album. Everything from start to finish is good. 'nuff said."
1,Weezer Is Gone,"I dont know what to say, all hope all weezer fans once had of another Pinkerton is gone, its perfectly clear that weezer has definetly abandoned the old days. Maladroit is a poppy MTV appealing record with meaningless lyrics. Its worse then the green album i cant honestly say i like one song on this album i'm sorry its horrible. It seems to me that Rivers is very confused after Pinkerton flopped his main focus was making an album that people liked but the ironny is that if u goto a weezer show the songs from The Blue Album and the songs from Pinkerton are the songs everyone loves and goes crazy to. I sincerely hope that weezer will go back to there old ways but all weezer fans know after two disasterous records that another Pinkerton will never happen, today is a sad day for all weezer fans."
1,What happened?,"Any self respecting Weezer fan should be in outrage at this disk. Many recent reviews I have read talk largely of the green album, however the green album shows the downfall of a once great band. After hearing this album I can only believe that they are now deep into the downward spiral into the pit of Sell Outs. They once played from the heart now it feels as if they are only playing to the pocketbook. If you want another popularity contest winner go with this CD, if you want good music go try out Pinkerton and the Blue Album."
1,Keep Fishin,"I must state my opinion on this absolute filth. Here I am, listening to `Keep fishin'"" at this very moment. This is the one hang- nail throughtout Maladroit that actually reminds me of old times. Weezer lovers know the capability of Rivers Cuomos, and he has surpassed that standard on The blue album and Pinkerton. A lot of fans lost faith in Cuomos, and frankly, I don't blame them. Among the titles he was given, sellout was one of them. A sellout, he isn't. He is one of the most artistically vulnerable performers of our time. He isn't out there ""making loads"", maybe bad music, but he is doing what he does best; expressing himself through music. Among others, I miss old Rivers, those great riffs, perfectly articulated lyric, and the flame that was apparent within the first two records. Please everyone; give Weezer some credit for being a great band, and remember them for the great music they used to compose. We love you Weezer, or at least I do. I do not recommend this album."
5,This is [good],"I have listened to this album so many times I lost count. It is utterly essential listening for anyone into this music scene. This has not left my CD case even once, except to listen to it over and over. Have you ever shuddered when listening to a really great song? Do you ever get goosebumps or feel a tingle when you are deeply touched by a peice of music or a good book or film? Do you choke up a little when your favorite tune comes on. This record did that for me. I like every song, but the first track is the very best. I demand that you fork your hard-earned money over ... and get this record. You wont be disappointed!"
5,Weezer is the best,"This new weezer CD is the greatest. Songs like Dope Nose, Take Control, Keep Fishin', and Fall Together make this CD weezers best yet. If you are a weezer fan buy this CD please!..."
4,This is dope,"I recently was introduced to Weezer's music through their 2001 self-titled release, otherwise known as the green album. The album was short yet catchy and infectious as any Green Day or Blink 182 album (not that I'm a fan of the latter band). When I first heard ""Dope Nose"" (the first single off ""Maladroit""), I was rather surprised to hear the loud, crunchy guitar riffs ala Def Leppard yet I loved what I heard. ""Dope Nose"" is a big departure from what I've heard from their previous album. Heavy yet the song manages to maintain the band's winsome melodies. I absolutely love ""Dope Nose"". Overall, ""Maladroit"" is definitely a lot different from the band's '01 self-titled album and I don't mean that in a bad way. The first half of the album is really strong but towards the end I thought the album started losing its edge. It just may be that I need to allow the last several songs to really grow on me but nevertheless the entire album is very good."
1,Manufactured Commercial Money-Hungry [stuff],"'Manufactured' is the only word that truly describes this CD. It should be obvious to anyone with a pulse that plenty of Weezer fans will buy this album, brought in by promises of a departure from the Green Album's poppy melodies and a reunion with the Weezer of old. My words of advice to you: DON'T. If you're expecting the emotional, irratic, and genuinely musical sound that was the Blue Album and Pinkerton, then I suggest you look elsewhere. This is even worse than the Green Album, as that at least vaguely resembled Weezer's unique style of music. This is just Weezer pushing out a ... emotionless album in order to generate a few grand. Another word comes to mind after listening to this CD - SELLOUT."
3,Loud Sketches,"These songs are loud rather than good, fragmented rather than fully ripe, and it was produced by the band rather than by that guy who used to be in the Cars. Too bad."
2,What happened to the magic?,"What happened to the magic?Weezer's first album was great and since then it's been a steady decline.It happened with Pearl Jam,The Smashing Pumpkins,Green Day, and now Weezer.What the hell is going on in music today?These guys used to be my heroes now they [are bad].Please guys stop overthinkig it and play from the heart.It's not witty or intelligent it's contrived and it [is bad]."
4,4 and a half stars really,"Maladroit is a winner: Solidly-crafted songs, walls of heavy-metal-crunch/post-grunge distortion, decent lyrics, the most compeling guitar solos and drumming in modern rock, and tasteful, garage-ethic production.Those criticizing the album are unfairly expecting certain proportions of this element of the Blue album and that particular feeling from Pinkerton, and non of that from the Green album; the way to approach this album and enjoy it is to listen for how Weezer is evolving and trying out new things, and for the most part succeeding."
1,two good songs=bad album,"i am a long-time weezer fan. from back in the days before they were a big success. back at the release of blue album. pinkerton was even better, then green album was catchy but way too methodical (every song has the same format, the guitar solos on every song that are the same as the melody get really annoying). then we get this piece of crap. i'm not really into the whole nu-metal influence here. if rivers would snap out of it and realize that its okay to write personal songs and that some people will give a damn and some won't... but it will result in a far better album. there are several songs on this album that are seriously horrible. there are MAYBE two quality ones, but even those are pretty crappy as far as weezer goes. rivers, i think your sweater has completely unraveled. isn't it time to get it resewn?"
5,Wonderful!!,"Maladroit is definitely much better than the Green Album. Every song is amazing. Some songs such as ""Keep Fishing"" and ""Dope Nose"" are fast and catchy, yet the lyrics have little meaning to them. Other songs, such as ""December"" are slow and contain deep meaning. There is a great mix for every emo/pop/rock lover out there!"
1,Irrelevant,"As time has progressed, one of the more interesting bands of the 90's have faded into obscurity. After PInkerton, they should have just hung it up. Despite the commercial failure of said disc, at least it was a master piece. the Green Album took one concept of song writing and extended it over thirty minutes. Maladroit does the same. Variations on a theme is all this record is. Thank god they gave it away for free on their website months before so i could tell how god awful it was before i paid for it.Until Rivers gets his insecure head out of his [expletive deleted] and write songs with more care, he will not have my business (and, as evidenced by his songs of late, that's all he is interested in)."
5,REALLY GREAT,"For those who say that Ella's singing was pure technique and lacked feeling (especially when they compare her with Billie Holiday) here we have the proof of that statement being absolutely untrue! Ella sings only accompanied by a subtle piano, and you can even listen to her breathing. It's such a creation of her own what she did with this collection of songs, the phrasing, the tempo, her voice at its peak, the sentiment deeply attached to each song (YES; THE SENTIMENT! ). One wishes that she would have done more albums like this one. A SUPERIOR EXPERIENCE."
2,A good general reference,This book gives pretty good general dog care suggestions. Does not provide very much specific information on Bullmastiffs. It is the most readily available book on Bullmastiffs.
4,great!,"This cd player is great! i really love it. I have had alot of cd players(all of them broke) but this one really stands up to what i do. I take it on all my trips with me. it has been out in the cold (40d) and still played. it has been dropped (alot!) and stepped on (by a horse, dont ask) it still works like it did the day i got it! I also go mtn biking and running with it. the skip protection is excellent. it never skips. one problem with it are the headphones that came with it. they are junk. after about 2 months with them it started to play in only one ear. i recomend you get some good headphones to go along with this great cd player. i dont know why people dont like it. this is my favorite cd player...ever!"
2,Not that great of a film,Story is very weak and the acting is robotic. I suggest missing this flick.
2,Good Movie.... Terrible DVD,"First of, I liked this movie. But this is probably the ugliest looking DVD transfer I've ever seen. The picture is grossly over saturated, with skin tones turning a dark orangey-red. In fact the entire movie takes on a dark red hue. The blacks are crushed; there is practically no image detail in the darker portions of a scene. The travesty is that the accompanying trailer has been beautifully transferred, looking brighter, with accurate colors and lovely skin tones and it emphasizes just how deplorable the main feature looks. How could MGM approve this DVD for release? Definitely not recommended. If you want to watch it, try to catch it at the movie theater. Or wait till MGM gets it's act together and releases a proper version on DVD."
3,When will I be loved,"It was ok,,, the last song was nice to bad you can't get it anywhere. There is not even a sound track for this movie thats available with that song. That was the best part of the movie,,, Butterfly."
1,NAKED NEVE CAN'T SAVE TOBACK'S NASTY FLICK,"Neve Campbell is stark naked in the opening of James Toback's WHEN WILL I BE LOVED (MGM).I was so sidetracked by this odd, embarrasing, lingering, voyeuristic scene that I began wondering how writer-director Toback convinced the talented, underrated Campbell nudity was essential to the movie. In fact, I thought about this throughout the very, very long opening act.When the plot finally kicked in very late in the game, it turns out to be Toback's unimaginative riff on ""Indecent Proposal.""A hustler-lover (Fred Weller) of Campbell's character brokers a paid date between aging billionaire Italian media mogul (Dominic Chianese) and Campbell.There's no answer to the rhetorical title question in this nasty film of greed, anger, deception and murder.You may want to take a shower when it's over.Note: I question the authenticity of posts that praise this film and bet they are Toback's stooges."
3,a pretty good film,"i watched this film recently about a restaurant that is on the verge of going down because of fast food business's coming in and other factors at work. Danny Aiello plays the same cliche fired up role that he is known for over the years. it is a intense drama from start to finish that is a decent film,but is missing that knock out performance to make this film stronger. it was pretty good film and it is a seasonal christmas time picture. it deals with loss and family. interesting film."
2,What the hell happened??,"What happened to this series? The first three books made a good story. The last three sketched only the barest outlines of any plot at all, simply as a framework for 1500 pages of Herbert's ideas on philosophy and politics. These stories are apparently suppoesd to have some significance since people always start dying at a ridiculous pace near the end of the books, but by then I didn't even care. The characters are one dimensional at best, simply used as pawns in Herbert's debates. Some of the ideas discussed are well presented, which is why the books rate at least two stars, but putting these discourses under the category of a ""Dune"" story is just ridiculous. And can anyone, anyone at all, give a clue what that last chapter is supposed to mean??"
3,Better than the fifth one.,"Remember, three stars does indicate a better than average book--it just looks low around all these fives. Chapterhouse: Dune was plagued by the same problems as HoD: it meandered and the philosophy seemed out of place in the plot. However, this time the complex threads of politics actually approached being as revealing as those in Dune, and the characters began to get a little more real. Herbert must have had some great insights into politics, economics, and human nature to write this book, yes, but he could have expressed it better. At least there were no more ""dependencies and key logs"" here. I wish he had lived to write the seventh Dune book!"
3,Not that good by Herbert standards,"Make sure you read the other books first or you'll be lost. This book reads pretty slow and doesn't have the drive found in earlier novels. It seems to be losing speed but at the same time keeping the reader entertained by Herbert like cultural dimensions, science and good writing. I recommend it to any hard core Dune fan but otherwise don't bother."
5,tight,super tight it's tight i like tight stuff it's real tight yeah that's tight you know what's tight? this is tight.
2,pity about the lapse into new age speculation,"I won't write much here as many have done a great job of summation, however I did just want to voice my disappointment with the epilogue. Much of the book seems to have the intellectual and reasearch rigour I like to see in such books, but the new age nonsense really leads me to question his credibility and so doubt I read till I reached it. Though its obviously not as up to date or the same in its attempted scope I would personally recommend Russell's ""History of Western Philosophy"" for a more insightful look at Western thought or even Watson's ""Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud""."
4,Almost completely brilliant,"I have to agree with the reviewers that noticed the sudden change of tone and scholarly level as this book comes to a close. While it is true that intellectually the 20th century has been one of a retreat from reason, no where does the author mention the great successes that have come along with that. I also find the ""end times"" message very distressing; to those who are unfamiliar with the current antiintellectualisms this part will strike one as odd. The rest of the book is a tour de force in every way - I wouldn't have thought one could do a history of ideas of western civilization in one volume. (Added later: There is one slight oversight in the discussion of Descartes, too. Tarnas labels Descartes an atomist - not true - Descartes' cosmology was plenist.)"
1,Very Difficult to Read,"""The Passion of the Western Mind"" suffers from poor writing. The sentences are long with lots of punctuation and emtpy phrases. Tarnas seems to write around his point. Here is an example sentence taken from the book: ""Although this perspective took on a number of distinct inflections, and although there were important contercurrents to this view, it would appear that not only Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and Pythagoras before them and Plotinus after, but indeed Homer and Hesiod, Aeschylus and Sophocles all expressed something like a common vision, reflecting a typically Greek propensity to see clarifying universals in the chaos of life."""
1,This book is terrible.,Someone has bought a thesarus and run rampant! This book was too wordy and full of hot air. I really don't care how many synonyms for one word the author can think to add to the text. This book could be compress to 10 pages if the author would simply come down of his mountain top and condense his often contradictory thoughts. It is the worst book I have ever read.
1,A Passion for wasting time,"This work takes top prize as the most articulate piece of nonsense recently published. While the author conducts his grand experiment with all the diligence and detail of a trained scientist, he fails miserably in his synthesis. He represents modern man's success in gathering information, seasoning it with something mystical, cooking it in humanism, and serving a half-baked idea of ""feminist rebirth,"" whatever that idea means.'"
5,Concise perspective of thought - Invaluable to all,"From archetypes to megabytes A Passion of the Western Mindis a clear, concise perspective of the progress anddevelopment of human thought. Tarnas examines what ideaswe have built upon and how, what ideas we have rejected andwhy, what we have let go of for alternative ideas, and howthese decisions have changed and shaped the construction ofour modern knowledge base. Comprehensive and intelligible,it is an excellent timeline of the history of thought andinvaluable to any student, professor, and historian."
3,Good idea but waterproof liner cracked,"This mat looks great and I really liked it but after folding it about 30 times, the waterproof liner cracked. This was only used to cover up a couch in my house that wasn't being used so it wasn't getting a lot of wear and tear. I never sat on it and I never used it as a picnic blanket.I'd re-think this if you're going to use it as a picnic blanket and are counting on it being waterproof."
1,Bootleg Poor qaulity and misleading !,You have to be kidding me! I am thinking I am getting a quality video of perhaps his performances or concerts. I get a bootleg type of copied DVD that seams produced in someone's basement. It looks like the video was copied off of some music video channel and duplicated onto this DVD to make this compilation. I have been in and around the T.V. and Movie industry and whoever produced this should be ashamed of putting something like this out. I could have done this with two VCR then turned into burned DVD. If you are a Marc Anthony fan this is an injustice to his music and what he has offered his fans. I mean yes these are his videos but it not what I thought the seller was offering. And the quality of the production is very poor! Please I recommend no to buy this product!CAL!
3,'Deserving of perhaps 1/2 additional star,"If Paramount executives thought that this film would attract more than the usual Trek fan base, they will be sorely disappointed. The movie features good acting from Stewart and Hardy, a decent Goldsmith score, state-of-the-art effects, but the story is somewhat recycled from earlier films in the franchise.Yeah, it works for Bond, but Trek was always more about originality. Sadly, while enjoyable, ""Nemesis"" brings nothing new to the table, with the exception of the Picard-Shinzon connection.But, loyalty is hard to break; thus, I will be buying the DVD, reported to have some additional footage."
1,Poor Trek Franchise gets Cheap!,I saw the movie and it was horrible; I saw the deleted scenes and thought what the hell are they thinking....Who the hell is in charge over there at Paramount....WHo cares if the movie is 3 hours long...Those scenes should have never been deleted....what a mistake they made!
2,Star Trek Nemesis or another boring try,"Fairly preditable movie and and edning that you can see coming a mile away. My advice, don't bother"
3,....Although the franchise needs the Genesis device.,"I am NOT a Trekkie. Being merely a fan of TNG, I found this entry in the series dissapointing especially if this be the last TNG film. STAR TREK-NEMESIS has the plotting of an average episode. Aside from one great effect (DATA's jump through space), the story was not engaging enough to be the journey's end. It would've been nice to see something as clever and creative as the ALL GOOD THINGS episode to cap off the best entry in the STAR TREK universe (yes, the best-better than the original series). Go back and watch INSURECTION again, it's really a great flick and would have been a great segway into the final chapter of TNG if only that final chapter was as compeling as the better moments in a great series of shows and movies. Too bad, would've been nice to see a couple more adventures from PICARD's crew, guess we're all stuck with the average STAR TREK-NEMESIS."
3,Where is the trailer?,I don't know why Paramount did not include the theatrical trailer of STX:Nemesis while they included a preview of DS9 DVD series...
3,"""Star Trek"" out of gas?","The whiny clone of Picard wants to destroy all human life on Earth with a deadly radiation emitting weapon. Not very original, not very entertaining."
1,"I rather watch Tera Patricks videos, she's a porn star","Sorry folks, but this movie not the Star Trek of just a few years ago. It was so boring, a yawner! I waited the whole film for something to happen and when if finally did, I could care less. This is not one of the 50 minute TV shows that used to get a little boring with all the talk, talk, talk, which would mercifully end at the top of the hour. This is a movie, they can't make talk fests out of them and expect them to be good.The Captan seemed out of character too, what was the deal with him being so happy in the beginning? And Data, boring, he ceased to be interesting when half the movie was about him and him! Then you had Picard and Picard why didn't the writers think to bring in Will and Will?All in all a very lousy movie. I thought the last one was bad but this one was really bad.How sad, that the advertised last voyage ended up as bad as Star Trek the Motion picture!"
2,On auto-pilot....,"THe trouble with this movie is that it seem to be run in auto-pilot. It looks more like an TV episode with extra-budget than a real feature film. I liked INSURRECTION much more.Of course, we're dealing here with charismatic characters that we all love, so we tend to be kind to the movie flaws. And there are not many. THe plo, altough its resemblanc with THE WRATH OF KHAN, is good. The acting is fair. It's just the ""feeling"" that is not right, I can not explain it properly... Something is wrong here..."
2,To Boldly Go Where Noone Wants To...,"I can't even begin to describe how disappointing this was.TNG will always be my favorite ST and to have it end on this note is truly sad. Finally breaking the tradition of even numbered movies being better - the responsibility of this disaster lies squarely on the shoulders of the director. They might as well have gotten John Woo - after all if you're going to destroy a franchise why not get someone with experience (ie. Mission Impossible II)The cast is still the strongest of the ST franchises and is the only reason this isn't getting a one star review. There's also a nice cameo by Janeway. Pity they couldn't come up with a better script than this. Worst of all the deja vu ending (circa Wrath of Khan) leaves even the non ST fans thinking ""Hmm this looks strangely familiar""I have every ST: TNG DVD but I think I'm going to pretend that this didn't happen. Only slightly better than Insurrection.Gene must be turning in his grave."
1,Supremely disappointing,"This bleak and dreary film lacks everything enjoyable about my all-time favorite series and left me with a dull ache in my belly. Aside from the brief wedding scene there is no warmth, no humor, no interesting locales or character interaction and the villian, who seems to have three-fourths of the film's dialogue, is neither menacing nor interesting, just an arrogant jerk. I wanted more Worf and Riker!!! There was a lot of action, but it amounted to nothing more than a prolonged space battle differing from episdodes only in that it was much louder and considerably longer. In contrast to the exotic and colorful settings of the Star Wars films, the masterful action sequences of the Matrix, and the dynamic characters and villians of the X-Men, this dead in the water bomb makes Star Trek look tired, uninspired and down for the count. I am praying for a miracle . . ."
4,satisfied,"Disc was brand new. Good seller. Not the best star trek movie out of all of them, but still a good buy."
3,Enjoyable but not satisfying,"I enjoyed the movie mostly because I'm a die hard Next Generation fan. I've always enjoyed the personalities and interactions of the characters. But in this movie I was very disappointed. The long awaited wedding and ""honeymoon"" between Troi and Riker was missing chemistry, passion, and love. I wasn't over joyed with Picard or Data either as they seemed ""out of character"". The other characters also seemed displaced. I'm not sure if the problem was the actors, director, story line, or all of the above. That said... I still plan to watch it again on DVD."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","I didn't see this movie when it was first released because each subsequent season of TNG after 5 got worse and worse, then the TNG movies got worse, so I expected this to follow the trend. Happily it did not, and was better than Insurrection.Even having improved upon the previous movie, it wasn't good enough to keep the TNG machine going. No fault of the actors, the writers and producers had a weak idea right from the beginning, but at least in this case, unlike Insurrection, it was well executed."
5,"By far, one of the best Trek movies...","This movie has been lambasted by fans and critics alike, but I think it was never truly given a fair shake. It offers a great look at the Romulan civilization, something seldom done in any of the Trek TV series, and it features great acting and character moments for all the major characters, particularly Data's sacrifice. You could definitely see Brent Spiners influence over the story in the Data's final few scenes. If you're a Trek fan, and you either haven't seen this movie yet, or didn't really give it a chance, I encourage you to take a second look. Heck, this DVD is worth it simply for the deleted scenes, one of which features Will Wheaton as Wesley Crusher, and another which features a comical scene involving a new Captain's Chair."
3,for the price...,"You have to realize this is a full set of knives for 30 bucks. They are ALL sererated. The 'never need sharpening' is a lie because after a year of use mine are quite dull. Its worth the cost of the set just to have a full set of steak knives though. The bread knife works well, but the chefs and paring knives suck (who ever heard of a sererated paring knife?) They WILL rust no matter how well you take care of them. Go ahead and wash them in the dishwasher and enjoy them for the year they last, then buy another set."
2,not a bad read overall,"The writing is too flowery for what it is about. There are times that it is difficult to imagine that he is in a battlefield of carnage, waste, and mud rather than out on a rambuctious hunting party. He seemed to be somehwat disconnected from the fighting; he rarely mentioned his own emotions or fears and his descriptions of battle are somewhat vague. If you don't reagrd it as a book about WWI and think of it as strictly literature it can be a pleasant summer-evening read."
4,"""DONT BUY A SIZE UP""","I ordened this for my gym workouts ,Im male 6 feet guy whit big hands my knuckle area is 8 inches the Large size its ok.One thing i noticed is the fingers is short,and the velcro hurts in some exercises.The firts time feels a litlle stiff but 3 or 4 days in use the gloves feels fine.The padding ist good for all the excercises,and the grip its the best thing in this gloves.PROS: Good gripConfortPaddingCONS: Fingers too shortA little stifness(in the firts uses)PD:Inexpensive gloves in this hard times your wallet not hurt¡¡¡"
4,"Not for a woman (or, get a smaller size)","I did a search on Amazon for ""weight lifting gloves women"" and these were one of the first things that popped up, so I bought them without paying too much attention (good brand, good price, what I was looking for). When they arrived and I put them on, in my size M, they were absolutely swimmingly large. So I gave them to my boyfriend and bought a smaller pair. Too bad - they seem like great gloves."
3,Weird socks,"These socks are ridiculous! The ventilation holes at the end are nice, but the socks themselves are way too small. It's very difficult to fit my big toe into the big toe area, although I do enjoy the stylish Mary Jane strap over the top of the foot."
4,A little big,I love the gloves I just wish I had purchased a smaller size. I have been using them for months and not come to the point where I need to wash them.
2,velcro straps are too stiff,"Overall it's a good product and is exactly what i was looking for. However, the Velcro straps are too stiff and they cut into your skin. Not sure if it is a design flaw or if a quality control issue."
3,Used for wheelchair,"Had to search online to make sure I got the right size. Couldn't trust the size chart displayed at the time.These came up under a search for wheelchair gloves, and although that is not their intended purpose they are cheap, strong and served the purpose quite well. They wore through in several places after two weeks.Id get them again if I lifted weights."
5,NICE Gloves for 8 Bucks!,"I use these gloves for my workouts withTHERACK Workout Stationand they are SO MUCH BETTER than theReebok Men's Fitness Gloves (Extra Large)that ripped down the seams. Based on winter gloves, I thought I'd need a Large, but would rather have workout gloves that are a little too large than too small. Also, my hands are just over 9"" as measured according to the sizing chart, which is right in the middle of the 8.5"" to 9.5"" for XLarge...So went with the XLarge. They fit GREAT! At first the velcro strap bothered me a bit. So now I just angle the straps in toward my knuckles before fastening the velcro and it makes a slight ""V"" shape. I also keep them somewhat loose and now I don't even notice the straps are there during workouts. Generous amounts of leather and padding exactly where it should be and somewhat adjustable if you get close to the right size for your hands. What more could you ask for at 8 bucks a pair?"
2,Not as sturdy as the older models...or as they look on the site,"I had a pair of harbingers for about 10 years now. Always loved them. My kids put them somewhere in my house, but that's not so useful when I want to go hit the gym. These looked the same on the site, but they are not. I am sending them back and figure I will have to order a more expensive pair in order to get the padding the old models had. The padding is probably half as thick and the stitching 1/4 of the strength of the older models. Hope I have better luck with the next set I order."
2,Too Small,I usually wear a size medium weight lifting gloves but these were tight and offered no protection on the joint in the middle of my fingers (used in pull exercises). Size up or pass on this.
3,Good Price and Good Padding but Itchy,"Really nice padding on the palm, almost too much, but for the price I was impressed. After the first use however I couldn't stand the itching from the sharp edges of the material inside the glove so I had to take a nail clipper to all the edges. That worked well enough to continue using them."
5,What a hoss,"Delivery was superfast--ordered dec 21, received dec 23. Had read lots of reviews and this seems to be the one for under 200 that gets it done. Beautiful, floor-shaking bass without overpowering the rest of the system, and hidden behind the couch so as not to irritate my wife--everybody wins. Sounded so good I had to upgrade my tv--watching a 27""crt with home theatre sound just wasn't going to cut it."
3,Middle of the road....,"These headphones are not very expensive. Don't expect the sound quality you would get from Koss or Sienhoffer headphones that cost upwards of $200. The bass is a little high, but that can be fixed with an equalizer. The headband could use some padding, but I've worn them for several hours at a stretch and never had a problem.I use these with my laptop computer to listen to MP3s while I work. I've also sat through DVDs on plane trips with them. For the price, they are a good buy.Why 3 stars?:These headphones do not have the sound quality of more expensive models, but the price is good and the quality is fine. They could stand to be a bit more comfortable, but at this price, I don't mind sticking them in a laptop bag and risk having them broken because I can replace them cheaply."
1,I Get Better Sound from My Sony Walkman Earphones!,"I'm not an audiophile so I'm not an expert in stereos and headphones etc but I do know that I just don't like these headphones! The sound level is terrible and flucuates and sometimes even loses sound altogether. I got these headphones about 4 or 5 years ago and had problems with them after only a short period of time and it is quite possible that Sony has worked out and fixed all of the problems with them but I'm not going to blow my hard earned cash on buying a new pair just to find out if they worked out the bugs or not and from my own personal experience I can tell ya that I have been very disppointed with these headphones and that I get better sound through my little Sony Walkman earphones and no I don't use these big headphones with my little Sony walkman, I use them with my sterio and my CD boom box only!"
2,Uncomfortable!,"I bought a pair of these a few years ago for use at the radio station where I work. They're uncomfortable, the pads make my head itch, and it makes a lot of noise when you move them. They look cool, but that's about it. I got them at Target for about $15 on an open-box buy, and ended up leaving them at the radio station.Don't get 'em. Get Optimus Nova-71's if you can find them."
4,This is undoubtedly the battery for you,"It's pretty hard to write a review of a battery; it either works or it doesn't. This one does. It also fits the unit for which it was intended. So that's two points right there.If you have a set of Senns, and the batteries that come with it aren't enough to keep you going (I actually find that they last closer to five hours than the four advertised), then this is the product for you. You might even want a recharging unit too, since they take at least fourteen hours to recharge, and the headset stand only holds two batteries. The spare battery can be crucial if you're like me, and often use the headset all day at work! Go for it!"
3,Why the sticker?????,The batteries I received were what I wanted and arrived on time HOWEVER they wouldn't fit in the device because someone had stuck a label on them saying something to the effect that if you removed the sticker the warranty was void.Huh? The batteries don't fit in the Sennheiser device they were made for unless you peel the label off which says you can't return them if you do. I assume that somewhere along the supply chain someone wanted to hide the origin data stamped on the batteries. Why I don't know.I'm not unhappy but I wouldn't recommend this company to a friend as I am still scratching my head as to why all the subterfuge was needed. Maybe they are recycled. Who knows.
4,Not a SENNHEISER battery!,"Based on the title "" SENNHEISER Spare Battery for Senheiser Headphonesby Sennheiser"" I was expecting it to be the Sennheiser branded battery, but it was some off brand. I was a little disappointed in that, but kept the battery anyways, hope it lasts a while."
1,Lifeless Battery,This is a worthless battery. Has very little battery life less than 90 minutes. This is a cheap imitation of the original battery that lasted about 4 hours per charge.
1,ZENNHEISER BATTERY REPLACEMENT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"After almost four years heavy use with the original battery, AB 151, powering my wireless HDR 30 earphones, the recent replacement hardly holds a charge. It came with no instructions for precharging, or for the need. I did so at the risk of warranty infringement.Of several sources at lower prices, I chose the unit sold directly by Amazon, I perhaps fell victim to the 'free shipping' enticement. At $25 plus change it was no biggy.....but perhaps of interest to a few remaininggood music afficiandos."
5,Sennheiser branded battery,Just received mine and it is a Sennheiser branded model - in a blister pack.Working great so far - it even arrived charged!
3,Quiet and Non-intrusive,"Fan works fine, is small and not intrusive into room space and is admirably quiet even at medium speed (significant other dislikes fan noise at night and quiet operation is thus essential). I would have given it a higher rating if it moved more air; although I recognize it is a small fan and has an inherently lower cfm output than larger fans."
1,bad bearings,I have had 5 of these fans and every one burned out the main fan bearing. There must be a fatal design flaw. Chuck Hird
1,"NO STARS Still waiting, never shipped....NO STARS","Well 2 months and still not received. Seems to be impossible to contact anyone after they have your money. Im a bit set back as I have bought many things from Amazon and usually really happy about the service. This time If I could give a zero star, I would do just that. Think I have been ripped off."
4,Most complete firearms offering available,I have purchased many issues over the years and hope to receive a subscription for christmas. I have found it to be a very complete resource for firearms as well as many other military surplus and survival based products. The classifieds are arranged for easy use and the articles are very informative.Shotgun News
4,Very Good Ring,"Ring arrived quickly and in excellent packaging. The marcasite really makes the ring. If it were only cubic zirconia, I would return it. The CZ part looks kinda cheap and a bit ""glue-y"". But for what it is, it's a great cocktail ring to wear out or everyday with business-wear. Sizing is true.Very Pleased overall."
2,Don't waste your money,"This ring is INDEED MUCH NICER looking in the photo, it's very thin, and not enough room on the finger. Amazon.com should be ashamed for false advertsing, or misleading people...I fault myself though, because I usually do the reviews first, but this time I fell in love with the way it looked, and just ordered it..I'm totally disappointed, and will NEVER buy another ring from amazon.."
1,Horrible!,This ring is very poorly made. I purchased it for a valentines day gift. Within just a couple weeks three of the stones fell out. I sent it back in had it exchanged. I recieve the next one and within another two weeks two more of the stones had feel out. I called asked what to do and ended up having a very difficult return. Not only that but they tried to only give me 80 % back when I was entitled to a full 100. % I would not recommend this item to anyone what so every.
2,Conversations With Other Women,Helena Bonham Carter holds her US Accent well for a brit throughout and gives her usual charming and slightly dizzy style free reign.A limited piece for Art House fans and derives from California Suite and even Jane Austen for modern times!
1,Sizes Incorrect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Bought for my son. Bought size 3 and was too small and are like size 1. Didn't bother to return.
5,recommended by my acupunturist,My chinese acuouncturist recommended that we take 2 caosules every morning because of the great Omega 3 oils in it. It has more ALA oils than flaxsee oil does. It is great for skin allergies exceme and hay fever
2,"Mediocre horror flick, disappointing ending","Films made in other countries like this always seem to be too 'polite' and dont match up to U.S. made movies. Especially the poo coming out of the U.K. who like to fool us with interesting looking DVD covers.The dripping water was a good spook spoof and the acting was acceptable for lip-synced foreign films. I would have given the movie 1-2 more stars if the ending was done differently, and they could have done it on low budget.It may be more of a hit in other countries (why I didn't give it 1 star) but after watching enough American horror movies your expectations may be too trained to enjoy this one.[Updated: Sorry, previous review gave too much away.]Grade: D"
5,Inspirational,"This is an absolute gem for anyone interested in motorcycle travel considering the times, the quality of equipment and well, the journey himself. I can only assume, like all the best adventures that ignorance of the task involved was bliss!This is the story of a real hero."
5,"Simply an incredible, timeless book ...","This book would be a fantastic story if it was written TODAY. It's even more incredible that it all happened in 1932-33.There are so many levels to enjoy in this book ...* The pure adventure of it all - setting out on a motorcycle (a 750 pound, 6-horsepower monster, no less!) to travel around the world in 1932. It simply is mind-boggling that he pulled it off.* The observations he makes along the way and how relevant they are even today. His observations of Afghanistan, in particular give insights into what has always been a war-torn country. If Bush & Co. had read this book, maybe we'd have left well enough alone.* His pure tenacity and luck to get in-and-out of the situations he stumbles into. Being in jail is just part of the gig, and he takes it all in stride.* The writing itself ... clean, crisp, and engaging. I couldn't put this book down.This book is fantastic whether or not you ride a motorcycle.HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Great Job Bill. Never Forget.,"Excellent view on how we worked. Bill & John did and great job! Lurp Teams were the ""Eyes and Ears of the Commanding General"". We had many tense situations. I personally slept with my M16 on my left side, my radio phone on my right ear and my 45 on my chest- finger on the trigger thumb on the safety. Ed Zapata RTO, Team G. Thanks Bill. Never forget you guys, Bill, Dave and Arthur Bell."
3,No Easy Access !-REVISED!!!,"True,recently I blasted this unit out of sheer frustration. Today Julie Holadird of TDK let me know the servers were back up, and the unit is now working beautifully! I also got help from Jon, Dean, and Victor @ the TDK On-line site. The only thing Regretably, the update service is free, so it doesn't seem to be anyones' priority. I only update info every 6 mo.I am glad, however to have this unit. I have 85 cd's recorded @ 320k, and have 9gb's left! GREAT JOB!!! Sound quality is GREAT!"
1,This is a REALLY bad product,"Never stable...drops connections continuously, from the time i set it up. I have 6 other routers, which all work fine...this router simply doesn't. Also notices issues with the amount of heat it gives off. Lack of any kind of firmware support is also an issue. Other forums online confirm that these are all common problems with this product. Office Depot confirmed it and replaced mine with a D-Link.Tech support was completely clueless, as many others have reported. They gave me the distinct impression that they had no training whatsoever, and were just reading the manual back to me from a screen."
2,great feature poor quality,"I got the router, and couldn't get it to work since the LED is red. Exchanged it and had it working for 3months, and the LED turned red again, and have to return it to the manufacturer. Very disappointed. When it works, it's great. But...."
2,Missing critical security features,"Router is missing WPA. You cannot hide your SSID. And you can not limit access by MAC address. Otherwise, it works well."
1,Not as Advertised - Don't waste your $$$$,"The description says: ""Encases full-tang, 3-rivet, poly handle""These knives are definitely not full tang and only have 2-rivets.They are going right back. Don't waste your money."
4,Hopeful.,"Haven't done much heavy cutting with these yet, but certainly noticed that even this ""gourmet"" set is quite a bit thinner than other Wusthof that I have worked with. I rate this with a hopeful four stars, but I realize that a revision may be needed after some heavier use."
4,paring kife set,All three knives are the Wusthof quality I expected. Three different shapes seemed over-kill at first - but I found them extremely useful. A well thought out product.
5,Love them!!!,"I love these headphones... I owned a pair before for a while and I wore them out so I needed a new pair. They're comfortable, the sound is great, and you can't beat the price."
1,Very poor durability,"I have bought and tried two sets of these. The design is good--stays on when running and is comfortable. But durability is very poor. The first was staticky from the get-go. The second soon became that way despite very careful handling. THe wire is just too thin and any movement near the plug causes static, or one ear goes in and out. I bought a Panasonic pairPanasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Portat the same time that were even cheaper, and they are much more durable, and have better, more detailed sound as well. They had much thicker wire, and a little longer wire too. They just are not designed to stay on while running, unfortunately."
4,"good small, headphones","This is my second pair, the older model had longer wires. This is why I only give 4 stars. An other foot or two would have been nice.The sound is great and you hardly feel that you are wearing a headset.Still love the product :)"
4,Featherweight Headphones,"I purchased these Sony Headphones to use with an MP3 player on daily walks. The ""in ear"" type of design looked ideal for hot weather use - leaving the ear uncovered and cooler. However, because of the very light almost elastic construction I found the ""seal"" between the headphone and my ear felt loose and the sound quality suffered to some degree. Obviously, this is a subjective situation; others could find the fit perfect. They are certainly a comfortable headset and as light weight as you can get."
2,work fine for a few weeks,"The sound is good. The fit is good. The wire is terrible. They last a few weeks and then break - maybe OK for super-gentle listening, but movement yanks the connections loose, either at the earpiece or the connector. Opened a new one which had a dead channel. Sent it to the warranty address on the package - it was returned as-is. No more."
4,Great product for the money,"I had a pair of these all through college and for 2 years after. The other reviews that say that one side of the headphones stops working are probably true, though it took my old ones 6 years for that to happen. I figure for around $10, that's way beyond my expectations. So far so good with my new ones. These are super comfortable and stay put when I am running. The sound quality is really good for such an inexpensive product. I will continue to buy these as long as Sony keeps making them, as I haven't been able to find a set of headphones or earbuds that fit my ears and stay in place like these do."
2,Hard to wear,"I read all the reviews before I bought these earphones, they all seemed to say that these earphones were comfortable to wear. I've had these earphones for over 1 month now and I still can't find a way to wear these earphones without them falling out. These earphones also makes you seem like you are wearing a hair band because of the way you're supposed to wear them."
3,Accurate description,"The description is accurate, these are definitely lightweight headphones. I picked them up for when I am watching videos or listening to music on my computer. The sound quality is good and they are comfortable to wear. My chief complaint is the length of the cord; it is very short and I had to pick up an audio extension cable to prevent the cord from draping across my keyboard during use."
1,Review on Sony,The cord was way too short and I couldn't use it. Luckily a coworker bouhght it from me or I would have returned it immediately.
4,Love these headphones,"I cannot keep buds in my ears, so these are a staple for my daily workouts. They are light (I feel like they aren't there), but they don't last. I have gone through 1-2 pairs a year for the last few years. I do use them both indoors and outdoors, however, and the fact that I keep replacing them reflects how much I like them (and they are inexpensive)."
2,Not comfortable....too much wind noise,"The sound in the headphones is fine and I really liked the fact they were light and fit over the head but the earbuds never really seemed to fit and they were slightly hard and uncomfortable. Maybe it is by design that they do not fit snug in the ear but while I was walking and jogging the wind kept whistling around the earbuds and I couldn't tune it out. (this wasn't a windy day either, just the normal air that would pass by you while walking or jogging.) The fact that they kept slipping coupled with the wind noise issue kept me distracted and aggitated to the point where I couldn't enjoy my work out. I'm going to go ahead and keep them and use them for a back up in case my headphones at work go out but these will not be used with my mp3 player as intended."
2,"Inexpensive, but not durable","I am on my second pair of these headsets, both of which have had a ""shorting"" problem with the left earphone. As a runner, I think perspiration is the culprit.So I have had to downgrade my initial review. I would not recommend these for folks who sweat.They sound great for the price. Very light plastic construction which fit snugly in ears and on head. I run 4.5 miles at a time and this headset stays put. They are not hinged anywhere hence do not fold and will not fit in a small pocket. But they are flexible enough to squeeze into a larger one."
3,"Pretty comfortable, sound good","Thesse headphones sound good, but their wire could be longer for more comfortable use. It would also be nice if they could fold for travel."
3,Best earphones ever that only last a couple of months.,"Like many other reviewers, I have found these earphones so frustrating because they are the best for running and the sound is great, until 2 or 3 months later when the sound goes out in one ear. This will be my 4th purchase of them. I'm going to try to get some kind of warrantee or refund next time."
3,Great when they work,"These are my favorite style headphones for working out in. My only complaint is they failed after less then 5 months of use and are only warrantied for 90 days. Not horrible for an $8 product, but I'd expect Sony to stand by their products better then that."
5,Great Headphones,I love these headphones. My earlobes are small and inserting the plugin type doesn't work for me. These vertical in the ear headphones are perfect. They fit well and don't hurt my ears. Really good product.
4,Decent quality,"I have a really hard time with ear-buds, they all hurt my ears. These Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones are perfect for my problem. They sit comfortably just outside your ear canal. They are very lightweight and comfortable, but also a little flimsy. Don't let your kids play with them. Sound quality is nice, could have a touch more bass, but overall decent sound. Listening to Maroon 5 remake of Prince's song Kiss right now. Sounds pretty good. :) Cord could be a little longer, but that's just my personal preference. For under $8, I says it's a good deal."
1,not comfortable,"Maybe its my shape of ears, but these headphones are not comfortable, especially in my right ear. They aren't flexible at all so I guess It's ""either they fit great or... Not at all"". Also the cord arrived linked at the plug end and when plugged into my mp3 player, I get some fuzz unless I hold the cord straight. Not impressed. I'll stick to buds I guess."
4,sound great,"These heaphones sound great however after awhile on side stops playing, I've had several pair do the same thing, but they're inexpensive to replace."
5,These headphones are just right!,"I cannot wear ear buds, I can't wear the kind with ear hooks. I've been looking for this lightweight mini style in stores, but with no luck. My old pair from the 80's were getting pretty worn out, so I am glad to get the newer version. They adjust well and have good sound with my mp3 player. I have a very active job: crawling, climbing ladders, faux finishing ceilings and walls and painting murals, so I need a pair of headphones that will stay on all day. They are very light and comfortable."
3,need to protect the plug,"I buy these in bulk and last from days to many months. Some only play in one ear from the start. I'm sure everyone knows by now that its due to the thin wires, and fragile connection at the plug. What you need to do is wrap 2-3 thin rubber bands around the plug area to protect against constant stresses (bending and pulling) there. If you have the patience and determination, when the wires go bad, get a $2 plug from Radio Shack, and cut the old plug off, and solder on the new one. This takes some experience, but can save plenty headaches over the long run. There are youtube videos on how to do it.5 stars while it works, and 1 star for SONY not being able to provide a decent wiring connection. That's why you need to pay attention to the wire thickness and plug size, and not just the sound when buying headphones."
1,Shocked me :(,"I ordered these to use for running. The sound quality was not great, but they stayed in my ears decently. The problem was that by the second time I used them I started feeling little electric shocks in my ear, (and no I did not use them in wet weather, not do I sweat much during runs in the cold of winter). They're in the trash now...not worth returning."
3,Great...While They Last,"The good news is that these nearly weightless headphones sound great, and will actually stay in the ears of those of us who can't seem to master ear buds (and seriously, what's up with those anyway?) The bad news is that I've yet to have a pair of these last longer than about 3 months before one channel (usually the left) goes dead.The lightweight wires are so insubstantial that a short circuit is guaranteed...and I have yet to be able to take things apart and patch them into working order again. So by all means buy these for small, relatively comfortable, good-sounding headphones (especially nice in the gym) - but understand that it's basically a disposable and won't last long."
5,"Great Sound, Good Price, Buy It","This is definetly one of my favorites. Very good handling of sound and in a featherweight package. These were a lot better than my old headphones. Best of all, they're only ten dollars. Easily affordable by anyone."
5,great sound !,"Definitely worth it! comfortable, durable and great sound. Had them for over 1 year - I use them to work out. they do not move and do the job - worth it."
3,"Good Sound, One Problem...","From reading the other reviews it is easy to see that these have excellent sound quality. I don't need to say more about that. However,there's one problem. After wearing them for an extended period of time, your ears begin to hurt...not from the sound, but from the fit of the headphones themselves. And if you try to lay down on your side while listening with these, it hurts A LOT. you can probably get more comfortable headphones with the same sound quality."
5,Perfect headphones,"I can not wear the little earbuds because they always fall out of my ears when I run and some other models of this style are too big for my head or too bulky. These are absolutely perfect. They are lightweight, they stay put, they sound great and are everything I need in a headphone. I have been using this particular model for years. I do replace them about every 6 months (one side always goes out). Worth it for the money though. Also, purchasing on Amazon was much cheaper than paying for these in a retail store."
3,Won't fit in my ears.,"Like other head phones, these cannot fit/stay in ears for long, it will easily come out. This annoys you while you are running. Other than that, sound quality is good and its light weight. But be careful with handling it can be easily breakable..."
4,Good so far,"Bought these about 3 weeks ago and have used about a dozen times. Use them only for running, mowing, or other yard work. I have an electric mower, so they don't need to be too loud and they work fine under the conditions I've subjected them to. I suspect there will be more problems when the weather gets warmer and sweat increases, but for now they still work even after the conditions in my ears are somewhat ""moist.""Obviously the sound isn't high fidelity, but they're good for what I need them for."
4,Fast Walker Music,The Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L is much better than the ipod earbuds. They stay in the ears with only a few adjustments in a 30 minute walk. The sound is better than average and has met my expectations. I enjoy listening to music again while walking.
3,Not that great.,I got these a while ago and I only use them at home while webcaming. It hangs loosely and the noise is not that great. I can't hear my friend on the other end sometimes. I haven't used them for running or anything so I don't know if they're good for that or not. it's not particularly comfortable either. Won't be buying these again
3,Good enough for the cost,"Sound is great, fits nicely into my ears. Only draw back is the location of the wires that tend to get in my way quite often while running, but its not a deal breaker. For less than $10, I'd say I got a good deal!"
4,Reinforce them with tape before using,I have small ear canals too. These are perfect for the gym. They stay in place but loosely and lightly and I can still hear people if I need too. I listen to books so I don't care if I hear background noise. I take terrible care of them and sometimes pull them out of my gym bag full of stuff by the cord.I used to go through a pair per year (about 150 uses) but my current pair I wrapped a little tape at each cord attachment and they lasted until I lost them!Looks geeky but I'm not sexy and I know it ;-)
2,Lasted 6 months,"I bought these earphones based on all the good reviews. The sound was good, seemed sturdy enough for just treadmill running, and I was looking forward to at least a year of usability. Unfortunately, the sound started to go out and get spotty acutely during a run and it's very annoying. Lasted about 6 months so obviously I didn't get to a year."
2,eh,"Decent treble and highs, absolutely no base. If you are looking for something cheap and cheerful fine, otherwise, would recommend senheisers running headphones for much better performance."
2,They worked so well...until they didn't!,"I used these while running because most 'normal' earphones kept falling out. This item has so many Pros and only one con that makes me give only 2 starts.Pros:-Lightweight-Cheap (super-cheap in fact)-Stays on through most vigorous exercise and you cant even feel it's there-Great sound quality and good volume for price-The plastic band holds its shape/strength despite putting it in various shapes (like thrown in my backpack with many other things) for daysCons:-After a couple of months of using it I started hearing static noise from one of the sides. I wonder if it was because of my sweat, but the they are now useless. I guess these are not sweat proof (It doesn't say so and they don't appear to be). So if you are considering using this for exercise, think again. Otherwise, these are great earphones for the price."
3,Good sounds,Good sound quality overall. They are a strange fit though because I'm used to regular ear buds. They stay put though and that was the point.
5,Great for use during workout,They are undoubtedly great for use during work out. They hold in place very well. they are probably on the flimsy side but for the price I give them 5 stars. like someone else has suggested if you are worried about them breaking then buy a couple more.
5,EFC - Scintillating show,"NO SPOILERSEFC is a wonderful series - all of the years not just the first season.It was after all, created by the father of modern sci-fi TV sagas - Gene Roddenberry.The costumes and acting are excellent with lots of characters that you love, hate, love to hate and just plain loathe.The character of Da'an, played by the highly acclaimed Ms. Leni Parker, is truly alien and is both a delight and an enigma.This series is one that proudly takes its place in the archives of timeless sci-fi. It is worthy of your hard earned dollars.A most enjoyable series with more plots than the local cemetary and a host of unforgettable villians and heros."
5,Absolutely brillant and funny,"Tom Sharpe is one of the funniest writers on the planet, and this is his masterpiece. It takes place in the days of southafrican apartheid, and it's weird, wild and wonderful and imposible to explain. For your own good: Read it!"
4,"Ford lovers, handy to book to read","This is an informative book to read, if only to be better informed about how the FORD ECU works. This won't make you a high performance tuner, but it is a great guide if you want to understand basic tuning procedures. Easy read, lots of good info."
2,Canon Camera lens- manufacturer defect,the lens had a defect. Almost broke my camera. Didn't realize the lens had a defect and I tried to put it on my camera. I returned the item and got my money back.
3,Disposable,"This lens takes GREAT pictures, but when considering a purchase, keep in mind this is basically a disposable lens. It works great, when it is still working. I had mine for about 6 months and took some of my best pictures with my XTi and this lens. Then it stopped focusing. I can't use it at all anymore. Was it worth it? Yes. I say this because I was able to get temporary use out of a prime lens to see if it was a good fit for me, and learned that it was. Would I buy another one? No. But I would buy the 1.4 version. I would never have known how essential a prime lens was without first having tried this one."
2,Overrated. IS usually better for low-light. Iffy auto-focus,"This lens is overrated. I just took two shots of newspaper print with my XSI camera in low-light. One with this 50mm f1.8 lens at 1/160 and f2.8, and the other with my 18-55mm IS kit lens at 1/40, f5.6. The resulting image with the 18-55mm kit lens was much sharper. So my simple test proved (to me anyways) that the IS makes the kit lens a better low-light performer (unless you need the higher shutter speed to stop the action). The only other reason to get this lens is the shallower depth-of-field afforded by the wider aperture. I would really find this useful, but the other thing I've noticed about this lens is that it often misses the focus. So I can't trust it.Also feels far too fragile to throw the lens in my camera bag."
2,Good but very limited.,"This lens takes great pictures, but why spend $85 for such a limited lens. Save your money and buy one that has a 17-55 range."
5,Good lens,"For the price think of it as a disposable lens. It has great optics, fast and pretty quite, but it will shatter if even dropped from a short distance."
5,Awesome little Lens!,"Definately the little lens I needed to add to my equipment!! Cant beat the price either! Does hesitate some on focusing and a little noisy but not too bad, overall cant complain and still happy :)"
3,great lens but you get what you pay for.,"This lens is great, when its working. I used it for portraits and it gave me great open aperature options with low depth of field and attatched to a dslr, it was more like a portrait lens than a 50. after 8 months of use though, the shutter leafs started to stick open at open. This resulted in over exposed shots when shooting at anything over 1.8, and took me several months to figure out why. Finally I figured it out though, and i still use it, I just have to check to make sure the shutter leaves are stuck with the DP preview. Great lens if your broke!"
5,A must-have lens for still photography,"I use this lens for close-up photography (with a close-up filter set) on a regular basis. The focal range of f/1.8 to f/32 is impressive, and it's sharp throughout. I've used it to take flower pics that blow up flawlessly to 16x20 prints as well as mouthwatering food shots for my brochure. It works great both on my old Canon EOS A2E film camera and my Canon Digital Rebel XT. For the price, it can't be beat."
5,nifty fifty,What can i say. This has got to be the best lens canon makes for this kind of price. The auto focus is always a little off so you may want to get in the practice of learning how to manual focus. I will normally use the AF to get in range and then the MF to get the sharp focus that i need. For the price and the speed that this lens can produce. I dont think this lens can be beat. Though be careful if y ou are putting this on a Crop Sensor. You will find your self about 10 feet away on portrait shots. So if thats what you plan on useing this lens for then make sure you have room.
4,Great first prime lens.,"If you are looking, you already know you need this lens. get one, and have fun. the 1.8 is an essential for anyone with a Canon DSLR.Enough said."
4,Great Price,Ok I am no professional when it comes to photography which is why I got this lens. I herd it was a good lens for the price from many different sources which is why I decided to get it. And I am not dis appointed. The quality of the pictures are amazing when you finally do get that perfect shot. However the auto focus on this is terrible but I think its mainly because of its lack of UMS. but like I said price wise its a great deal.
2,Not as good as people think,"Out of focus out of the box, tried so many shots with 7D with different setting but did not improved .Don't know that i had a defected on or just because how it isAny recommendation to get the lens in price range but it work better than thisPlease, helpThank you"
4,50mm Lens - Love,"I brought this Lens as i had heard/read great things about it and i must say it has not failed.I love it. Its nice and light, easy to use and takes fantastic photos. I wish i had brought one when i first got my camera."
4,Great value,"This lens is a fantastic value. It is plastic and doesn't feel nearly as good as other lenses, but when push comes to shove it does its job very well for a very low price. (The auto focus is noisy, but not prohibitively so.)My wife and I are about to have our first baby so budget is a concern-- because of this lens I will be able to take sharp pictures without a flash at a price we can afford."
4,Ditto,"I don't have anything really to add but my own experience. As everyone else has said, this is a cheap lens but it takes VERY good photos. It feels cheap, it looks cheap, its noisy as can be when focusing. That said, it is the best hundred dollars I've spent on photography. I am not a pro and it works for me as I am learning. If you are a pro or are doing some kind of mission critical photography DON'T get this lens. People who purchase this lens and expect it to be as good as the $350 1.4 crack me up!"
3,Taking It Back,"I bought this lens because the 1.4 50mm is impossible to find. Everyone is out of stock and I wanted a 50mm lens. This was cheap enough for me to get ""in the mean time"" and I thought I would sell it when I can get my hands on the 1.4. What a mistake! I'm going to take it back. When it works, it's great, which is why I gave it three stars. The problem is, it doesn't work lot of the time. I often shoot in low light, and this lens can not focus! It's ridiculous to have a 1.8 ability and blurry pictures. The focusing motor is LOUD too. The lens just keeps going in and out trying to focus and rarely finds it. I often have to turn the auto-focus off and focus it myself. It's very frustrating since I'm doing a self-portrait project right now. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"Not a waste of money, but a waste of time","This lens is worth about what you pay for it. It's very soft around the edges when wide open. Optics are so-so, but the build quality is very cheap. I think someone else likened it to a ""Cracker Jack Toy"". That pretty much sums it up. This lens, if put to good use in the field, would literally fall apart. It felt so ""cheap"" in my hands...rattle...creaking, loose, cheap. I got rid of it just as quick as I bought it."
4,Good lens but not as sharp as I expected.,"I had to return this, It's not a bad lens at all, at this price, it's a bargain, but I needed something sharper. (with 3 times the price)"
4,A lens that should be in every Canon users camera bag.,"This lens is so fast yet so inexpesive...there are two dwonfalls which can be overlooked quite easily. The first, is the build quality. The lens is made of plastic...hey, for less than $80 what do you expect. You will not find a faster lens at this price. The only other issue is it focuses painfully slow. Regardless of those two issues you will not find a more razor sharp lens that creates bequtiful bokeh anywhere for the moeny!"
5,My best lens,this is the lens I leave on the Xti when I am not using it. It is the most versatile and takes sharp images at high ISOs.
5,Get Ready to Waste Tons of Time,"My husband purchased this lens for me as a Valentine's day present (he's so sweet) - it's amazing. I'm a new amateur photographer and have been learning a great deal on my new Canon XSi, and I was told that I had to have this lens. The person who said that was right. This lens is an absolute blast and I've been taking amazing photos with it. It's a definite must if you've got a Canon digital camera!"
3,"Beautiful Photos, Low-Quality","I bought my first Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Lens at the beginning of February 2008. It is now the middle of June 2008, and I have just broken my second one.I'm a HEAVY photographer, and this lens has BY FAR become my favorite to shoot with. However, it seems to just fall apart after a few months! HEARTBREAKING!I'll be contacting Canon about replacing my lenses, and I might spring for the 1/4."
2,Problematic though great.,"I bought this lens a few months ago. The pictures I took with it are great! Sharper than the pics from my XTI IS lens. However, everytime I use it (after a few shots), I will get an error on my camera -- Error Code 99 (something like that) and something about remove and install the battery. Most of the time, reinstalling the battery does not resolve the error so I always carry my kit lens.It is kind of frustrating that you just never know when this lens will work and when it will not. :-(I am now looking for a more dependable lens."
