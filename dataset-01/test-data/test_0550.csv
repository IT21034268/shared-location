3,At this price?? Are you kidding??,"I don't care how great this toy is, it isn't worth the price apparently many of you are paying. You guys have fun paying an arm and a leg for these things, Ill wait till they come down to more reasonable prices (and if not, I guess its one item I won't be buying). Its amazing how much some of you are willing to pay to get this TOY under the tree...lol"
5,Hours of Fun!,"After seeing my 3 year old play with this exhaustively at the Hands on Museum, I was thrilled when he got this as a gift for his 4th birthday. He will get up early in the morning and come down and play with this for hours by himself. Even 10 year old big brother gets in on the act. They compete as to who can make the most creative design, making houses, garages, car ramps. No batteries, no adult set-up, no maintenance; just pure imagination. And, yes, I'll be breaking down and getting another set. Home run!"
4,Cool toy for kid,"Bought this for my 4 year old daughter, and it is very unique and helpful toy, developed new imaginaton, Though 32 pieces were not enough we had to order more pieces"
4,Good movie!,"This was a very good movie--no cuss words, no violence. It is a truly G movie! However, I do not think very young children should see this movie since there are sightings of a ""ghost."" It turns out to be a logical explanation, but it may scare them.It is funny, clean and suspenseful-just like a Nancy Drew mystery! This is a good movie and a must-see for kids who like suspense and adventure."
4,Clay tarkets,"had no problems shooting these , All clays where in great conditions and worked like they should , They break beautifully"
4,Solid Fourth Novel,"""House of Chains"" started rather slow and I found it difficult to identify with the characters in the first 200 pages or so. These characters gradually became more palatable. That being said, it was the return of characters from the previous books that made this an enjoyable read for me.Frankly, it was those original characters (the Bridgeburners especially but also the Daru characters) that made the first three books so engaging. As Erikson moves away from those characters, I find myself caring much less about the world he has created. So, while I did enjoy this fourth entry in the series, it has also made me somewhat reluctant to continue reading future entries. Erikson is capable of creating some extremely dynamic characters but he is also capable of creating characters at the opposite end of the spectrum."
2,Didn't keep moisture out; gets in the way on some weight machines,"I workout regularly and vigorously and thought an armband holder for my mini would be better than the included belt clip. I was wrong. The neoprine is supposed to keep the moisture out but after three uses my mini was slightly damp. Also on some machines (e.g, ab crunch) the armband got in my way. I went back to the belt clip and am much happier. These things are pesonal though so this product may work for others. I also want to note that Amazon is letting me return the item, no shipping cost and no questions asked. That's good customer service."
5,Very Good Informaition,"I love these books they do give someone a clear outlook on what's the truth and what is not.I am Catholic, and I have been all my life. These books makes what was hard to understand and brings it to light.They are full of understandable material that people of all ages can understand."
4,Buy it in leather,"I actually have the first version of this Bible and I think the biggest difference is the number of inserts, so my review applies here. My biggest criticism is that, after having had it for several years and using it extensively, the binding started falling apart. I'm going to try the leather bound for my daughter. I prefer the RSV version, but that one doesn't have footnotes. I've been happy with the footnotes here."
4,Great Catholic Bible,What I appreciate most about this version are the inserted paages with questions that people ask about the Catholic Church. The questions is asked and the answer given. At the bottom of those pages are the references to both scripture as well as the Catechism of the Catholic Church so one can truly understand. Great for youth and RCIA
3,Book review,Great catholic bible very easy to understand. I am in the process of becoming a catholic and this is the book we use for our classes. We use this bible in our RCIA class and I and many others would love it please if the author would make it so this book is available to be read on a kindle. This book would get a prefect rating if only it was available in Kindle form.
5,THE LAST STARFIGHTER AWESOME !!,"i WATCHED THIS MOVIE MANY YEARS AGO AND I THOUGHT SOME OF MY GRANDCHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT, I WAS RIGHT..THEY LOVED IT."
4,Excellent reproduction,"I am a fan of this movie from way back. The Blue Ray version is clear, color is excellent and sound is great. If you love this movie, buy it. If you've never seen it, buy it"
3,Cheesy campy fun,"It's light fare, especially for the SF genre of today. But if you go with the camp, it's a fun movie -- especially with Robert Preston, who makes the show watchable."
5,Great Movie!!!!!,A great movie that I grew up with. Sci-fi fans and gamers will love The Last Starfighter! The graphics where top notch for its day.
4,The Last Starfighter,"The Last StarfighterWith fond memory of this movie, I looked it up and ordered it. Have watched it three or four times and when a friend visited while I was watching, I said she should see the opening scene which is delightful. Upstart--we watched the whole thing, again. The special effects are primitive by comparison to today's, but well done for the period and the whole of it continues to charm."
4,Wrong DVD Region,Your company sent me an American DVD region of this DVD when I clearly live in Australia. I had to recode the DVD to watch it on my Australian DVD players.Please make sure your company checks the DVD region before sending it to Australia.ThanksSteve
5,Still an awesome film !,"first off, this is my FIRST blu ray disc... and i have to say the quality of this film is top notch!anyway..back to the film..i remember seeing this when i was a kid(80s best decade ever) and i was hooked instantly...why they never made a sequel to this ill never know..great performances all around in this one.. you have robert preston as the alien con man with a heart centari..and the ""gung ho igauna"" grigg...who is played to perfection by daniel o'heliery the actor also played the nefarious ""old man"" in the first 2 Robocop films..to me he stole the show here... plus the grigg makeup job was top notch...i wont go into the story..you know it..you love it:) its just as you remembered it. this is one film that should NOT be remade...its a classic because, it still shines.the documentaries on this disc are great also..theres a lot to enjoy here..Bottom line this is a must have in your film collection..welcome starfighter.."
5,One of my favorites.,"Ordinary boy, ordinary life, improbable opportunity reluctantly taken. Every girl's dream boy... in uniform, with his own version of a set of wheels!"
4,Wonderful,This has been one of my favorite CDs for years. It is one of those CDs I still actually listen to.
4,Very interesting read,"Reading this not only provides you with lots of factual information about astronomy but also takes you into the lives of astronomers, how human they are despite their absolute brilliance. I was never much for astronomy before but this book incites such a great interest for the subject in its readers. the best thing about this is that although this book is about hard-core science, even a layman can understand and appreciate it."
4,Excellent,worked perfectly with a vintage Altas stand. Too bad they don't just sell the inner parts separately - but Atlas want our money... Minus one point for Altas being greedy.
4,Buy it...or not,"Here's the problem. It contains cartoons from Your Momma Thinks Square Roots Are Vegetable, Who's Up for Some Bonding, and Am I a Mutant, or What! So, if you, like myself, purchased those titles, you already have the strips. But, the Sundays are in color. Nice! If the color is not so important to you, save your money. If it is, donate the smaller books to your Friends of the Library book sale. Personally, I wish comic strip compilations printed the original publication date, as does the complete Peanuts series. This does not. This is a great, albeit redundant collection. Buy it...or not."
3,OK,Not bad as far as this genre goes. The problem is that the book never answers its own question. Can anyone or any book do so? Prob not!
5,great!,Great high tech cables of exceptional quality. Don't be fooled into paying for fortune for some other brand names. These cables are top of the line.
1,Blah!,"I bought this CD on reccomendation from Amazon.com - that was a mistake. It's just boring lo-fi humdrum. I think they recommended it because I had purchased a Red House Painters CD - well, these fellas sound nothing like the RHP. Be wary of a computer telling you what you might or might not like."
5,A Beautiful Christmas Book,"That Blessed Christmas Night is a lovely recounting of the events that occurred on the night Jesus was born. Dori Chaconas' rhyming verses have a gentle, song-like quality that paint a peaceful picture of that first Christmas night.The illustrations, which show the characters as young children in a Chrismas Pageant, are beautifully done. The detailed pencil-work of Deborah Perez-Stable results in remarkably life-like illustrations.This is truly one of my favorite Chrismas books."
5,45 little knives do the trick,"in tenderizing meat (such as beef top round). It's quick, easy, and effective. You'll not be disappointed."
4,Really good.,This tool is unbelievable. I use it on just about every cut of meat or poultry. I have not had a piece of beef or pork that wasn't melt in your mouth since I have been using this.
5,A 'must' for this subject,"Unlike many other books on this controversial subject, like those by Redford, which tend to present only such material as supports their preconceived opinions, Hoffmeier presents highly documented data on all sides of the question. He avoids snide ""put-downs"" of intellectually questionable methodologies, allowing the reader to judge for himself how valid are some of the conclusions that are reached. The extensive bibliography makes this a source book of great value."
2,AND?,"Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems that while this book might provide a nice skeleton for managers straddling the line between development (techitecture) and business strategy (marketecture), the meat is simply not present. So many opportunities for REAL examples went either unaddressed completely, or worse, were answered with meaningless little 2-paragraph sidebars filled with sentences like, ""then we sat down to talk about things and we decided to approach things from a different angle, blah, blah, blah."" Thanks. I can't say this book was a complete waste of time but it certainly wasn't the best use of my time, either, sadly. And the coining of these ridiculous terms like ""techitecture"" were truly hard to take."
2,"One good song, the rest... meh","This cd is so forgetable that even in the days when Hair Metal was the only thing I listened to, I didn't listen to the entire CD. I liked the song Heart of Gold and would pop the disc in for the length of time it took to play it, then out it went again."
4,Very good!,"While not my favorite CD, this is a good album because of the music. ""Luck Be a Lady"" has been sung and recorded by many people. Frank Loesser was musically gifted. Guys and Dolls is his best evidence."
3,"Good read. Light, fun romance.","Enjoyed this as I do all of JAK's books. She‘s always entertaining, even if she is predictable. Good dialogue. Strong heroine."
3,Should have moved on!,"I have to admit, I was disappointed. Granted, this is a reprint of a 10 year old book, but it should have stayed there in memory. I did not read many romances then as most of them seemed to involve women who were ""pounced on"" (marginally acceptable) or raped (completely unacceptable)and the rest of the book telling you why it is OK 'cause they ""were meant for each other."" No way! I gave it 3 stars as this book has some redeeming factors and the hero isn't as bad as some. The heroine is childish, but improves. I prefer Jayne's newer stuff."
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed the book very much. I am a big fan of Jayne Ann Krentz. Since this is a series, I am going to keep looking for the other books. I think you will also enjoy this book."
4,Satisfying,"This is a satisfying overview of Hungarian history. The only shortcoming is unbalanced attention paid to modern and premodern period. Half of the book covers more than a millenium long premodern period until ca. 1830, another half is given to 170 years since then. For this reason, the earlier history is sometimes dealt with superficially, while the newer history perhaps sometimes goes too deep. Nevertheless, the book is worth reading and treats the matter in an objective manner."
4,Great disc with bonus match and Rhyno's Night of Glory,"BFG was one of the biggest nights for TNA. It was their first PPV after moving to Spike TV and gained them bigger prominence. The sudden drop-out of Kevin Nash forced the entire card to be rewritten in a major way. If you're a Rhyno fan, this is THE disc to get as he does amazing work: A four-man Monster's Ball, a 10-man Gauntlet and then winning the NWA title. While it was a short reign, it was great to see him get his due and is worth remembering.Another great bonus is the Ultimate X match. On the show, the ropes broke which threw the whole match off. However, TNA had a rematch on a prime-time special and include that rematch as an extra on the disc which gets them kudos. I just wish they'd fill the five-show gap between this and Lockdown by releasing those PPV's in stores too. Still, one of the better examples of how cool TNA is."
5,TNA TNA TNA,This is one of the best pay per views ever better than all the wwe. Monsters ball two with Jeff Hardy doing the flip of the stage again Awesome. Rhyno wins the world title. Best of all the Iron man 2 match with AJ Styles beating the Fallen Angel again. That was the best match of the night. Also Peaty Williams vs Chris sabin vs Maverick Matt in an ultimate x (this ultimate x was not the best one but also on this dvd tna gives you the rematch of the ultimate x. Tna truely cares for its fans. I cant wait for the next TNA ppv. I orderes Destination x and it was Awesome. Scott Stenier in TNA.
5,The Best,"Had tried a competitor's CD-RW and had nothing but problems. Purchased Plextor's 12/10/32A based upon reviews in leading industry magazines. Drive took about 10 minutes to install, and immediately burned a flawless audio CD with 18 tracks 10 minutes later. The documentation and software included is also more than adequate to get you started. If your considering purchasing a CD-RW, you can't go wrong with this drive."
3,"Good drive, bad software on Windows 2000","Hardware wise the Plextor seems to be a solid drive .. it copied all my digital camera pictures to the included CD-RW disk in an instant .. the software that comes with it is another story .. the software CD lists Windows 2000 as a supported version for all the included programs but not only are they not W2K compliant, they also can wipe out all your CD-ROM devices under certain circumstances (like having MS media player and IE 5.5 installed) .. it took a lot of searching the MS Knowledge base to find the solution which was to delete 2 entries from the Windows registry .. all the software is out of date and needs patches applied and the drive firmware also should be updated .. if you run W2K I would not use the bundled software .. it's a shame Plextor chose to cripple the drive with lousy software since the drive seems to be very good .. I would like to rate it higher but the installation was too difficult to overlook .."
5,Erotic at its best!,"I must say this is one of my favorite erotic books. Emma Holly did a great job of telling this story. She definitely delivers a great read in this book. I'm not sure that I've ever read another book that was able to weave the threesome scenario into the story quite as well as was done in this book. You are able to bond with the characters and actually understand their points of view. The sex is great and not ""raunchy"" as it can sometimes be. If you have an open mind and are willing to explore this is a wonderful book for you. I think the title was also released again more currently so you could check out that one too."
1,Beware if you're buying this for the homoerotic content,"This book came highly recommended for its male, male, female threesomes. Being an avid reader of homoerotic erotica for women, I was thrilled at being able to get something new. Sadly, I was much less thrilled to actually read the book. While there is interaction between the men, who are lovers before the female protagonist shows up, the book is written from the female lead's point of view, and takes a dim look at the male sexuality displayed there.The sex is described in very unappealing terms, ones usually associated with law suits and jail sentences. Not at all sexy. Frankly disappointing."
4,A Very Senual Read!! Emma Holly Is A Great Storyteller!,"This is without a doubt a book that falls under the sub-genre Erotica. With that said I would like to point out that although the sex scenes are hot and plentiful they by no means cheapen the storyline. The characters are great and the storyline is also very entertaining. Emma Holly is without a doubt a very talented and gifted writer and one that I highly recommend if you like your romance reads steamy, hot and uninhibited."
3,short of ink,"im enjoying this a bit but im also a checker player and would defintely like the checker coordinates ( numeric notations) shown in every instance as I dont have them memorized, so I can follow the book better. I would not buy it as its more about the ego of the programmer than about checkers."
1,A Note of CAUTION is Needed,"While this is a fun book to look at, and addresses a badly needed topic, this book contains some misleading, questionable, potentially dangerous advice. As a person who works with dogs and children, and who spends much of my time cautioning children about keeping away from a dog's face and watching their movements and body language around dogs, both familiar and strange, I cringe at the possible results of a chid following the advice, ""Sniff his nose to tell him not to be angry or confused."" I would not advise an adult to do that. Waving objects over the head of a dominant dog, as suggested in the text, can also be dangerous. Dogs see children as litter mates and tend to want to correct them as they correct each other, with their teeth. I urge you to approach the ideas in this book with extreme CAUTION!"
1,Cute Book Contains Problematic Info,"Following the advice in this book is a recipe for disaster for children and adults alike. While understanding canine behavior is helpful for dog owners, attempting to relate to dogs as described in this book would land most owners in the emergency room. There are much better books written by authors such as Patricia McConnell about living with and training the family dog using humane, effective and safe methods. If you are a dog trainer, buy this book as a guideline what not to teach your clients."
4,"A hypnotic , gripping thriller with impeccable performances.","Trigger effect is the directorial debut of writer David Koepp who proves himself as talented a director as he's a writer. His first film is a bizzare piece of suspense\thriller that grabs the viewer through till the finale. Intriguing , stylish and visually beautiful and filled with great performances from MacLachaln and Shue this a unique movie experience."
4,The Bob Newhart Show - The Complete Second Season,"Fantastic show. Bob Newhart is a classic and master of the dry wit. My only question is this: when they finish releasing all of The Bob Newhart Show on DVD, will they FINALLY start releasing the equally classic Newhart show from the 80s?"
2,Vaio was not as described. could had done a better job with the packaging,item had a long wide scratch on the top of the cover. I believe this was caused from the poor packaging. seller offered refund or exchange
4,I like it,"Well to be honest with you, the last person that wrote a review on this is telling the truth. My hear beats for you is the only song on here that you will like also. ""My daddy"" is ok also. These boys were from San Francisco, CA. I remember when they were little boys. If i can remember, their names were Ronnie, Bobbie, and they had a little sister named China Doll. They were some fine a** little boys when we were young. I used to have a crush on Ronnie, but he picked my best friend instead of me....boo-hoo. I know one of the boys died after they moved to L.A. So sorry to hear that and I wish they would of made some more albums, I would probally still be buying them.....that is if they made a song like ""My heart beats for you"""
2,Stock unavailable,Ordered a curtain color and was called and told it was no longer in stock. Had to get a different color. Not what I was expecting. Didn't like it so I had to give it away.
1,Not even worth the time to write a review,"This book is deserving of zero stars. I've read encyclopedia articles that are more interesting and decidedly more dramatic.The author needs to acquaint himself with the concept of pacing. And for God's sake, he needs to get out his red pen and edit his work! He presents painfully long descriptions of events and actions that prove ultimately meaningless to the story. The main character is a completely unrealistic and rather unlikable person. With that exception, the rest of the characters lack anything resembling adequate and full descriptions. I generally expect some mistakes with a self-published book, but this one is over the top with typos. The author should have spent more time looking for grammatical corrections and less time describing the intricate details of (who cares what)."
1,they sent not what was advertised.,"No it did not meet my expectations!It arrived without wheels, and the reason I was ordering this one was because it was advertised with wheels. Even on this image you can see that it is offered with wheels. Very disappointed.Also it was wet inside.I had no time to return it, I was leaving the country.So here."
1,does not fit MiliOn 200 usb led,This bracket is too big for the milion 200 usb led light. I think this is an older bracket that may only fit older cygolite models
1,Save yourself the headache...,"This unit worked well for about three months. All of a sudden it quit displaying video and I get no audio. Email tech support is a joke. No responses after 4 attempts. Phone support gave me a ""we've never heard of that before"". Yeah, right. Save yourself the headache and chose another video capture device and especially another manufacturer."
3,Basically works,"Works well enough. Software requires more than 100 megs for install, for some reason, and is very slow to load, and is apparently no longer supported. Video quality no more than adequate. I would recommend a Hauppauge PVR, which certainly has its own quirks, but they're *better* quirks."
2,it works but....,WHY DID I ONLY GET ONE and if you have a game system beware if you don't put this on right it will get stuck then when you open it will shoot and and spin and get caught only uses it for cds or dvds (because there cheaper then new games)
1,Getting worse with every release...,"Perhaps people at Borland should learn how to follow the versioning guidelines, before they spit out a new, major built, almost on a quarterly basis with no apparent changes whatsoever.Cons:1. It is written in java.2. It has its own installer (which wrecks havoc on my system).3. It loads for 3 minutes, eating up 160 megs of RAM before I even start using it.All those minor things aside, when a development app crashes on me, that's where I draw the line!"
2,Overproduced,"I became an instant Keiko Matsui fan when I saw her perform on a Session at West 54th Street on public television. Soon after, I purchased this CD; after all, four reviewers give it 5 stars. Big mistake. This CD sounds like Kenny G with a better keyboard artist. OK if you like Kenny G. I don't. Can anyone point me to a Keiko Matsui CD that strips away all the reverberating horns and hi-tech percussion noise?"
3,1001 ways to say the same thing,I was expecting more from this book but it to me seems like a collection of one page notes on how to say the same thing different ways. Unfortunately it does little to nothing to actually TEACH you how to think for yourself and do it right the next time without having to reference the book each time. Perhaps it came across to me as common sense in a lot of cases but I felt it a waste of my time reading it from cover to cover. I'll hang on to it as a reference but I don't even think I'd be able to find what I am looking for in that case.Probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know unless they fail at the English language.
3,Interestinginly Informative,"Customizing the Body is an academic study of tattooing and the whole culture that surrounds it. For most people the best part of the book is its introduction, which provides an excellent mini-history of tattooing and how it found it's way into western society. The rest of the book covers modern tattoo culture -- Becoming tattooed, tattooing as a career, and other issues surrounding tattooing and tattooists. The study is complete on an academic and informative level, yet is also easy and impelling reading that should appeal to anyone with a serious and non-voyeuristic interest in tattooing -- this is not a picture book."
3,Disappointed,"I was not familiar with The Gathering and thought this would be a good intro. However, it was a mistake. The DVD is terrible: poor sound quality, no matter what setting you choose. Anneke was not what I expected at all and due to the distraction of the terrible production I could not tell if I would actually like the music either. To be fair, one should not make musical judgments on this band based on this DVD. The videos were better quality, but by then I was too annoyed to enjoy them. I am rating 3 stars instead of 2, because I think that some tracks would have actually been musically good if not on this DVD. Again, trying to be fair: being a fan of symphonic metal and goth metal, quite possibly ""the Gathering"" genre (strictly hard rock) was not really suitable to my taste."
3,Don't blame the band!,"The Gathering had nothing to do with it's release! The sound and the picture quality leave something to be desired. Furthermore, there is no added information, no animation, no frills at all! It seems rather speedily put together and cut & dry. The video clips are less than bootleg quality. Aside from all of that I would still suggest buying it because THE GATHERING is the best band of all time! And it's not their fault that a rookie released a video without their knowing. The director of this movie should be ashamed trying to blotch their pristine performance. On a lighter note ... Anneke still rocks!!!"
4,A funny novel about the sports cars in the 50s,"She needs money, because she made a serious mistake in the bedroom. Funny and period accurate story of the early Jaguars, MGs, Aston Martins, etc. and their drivers. Set in 1950s Los Angeles. Every car guy should have this book in his/her library along with ""the Red Car"" and B J Levy's series."
4,"""SUPERFIGHT""","I love this guys response to how Joe Louis was past his prime when Marciano destroyed him, louis was 38.Ali was 35 during his last fight with frazier, and I think most would consider him still in his prime at that time.As for the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" Ali was 34 fighting a much younger George Foreman. And lastly even though I think Ali is great he NEVER fought anybody of Marciano or Louis's Caliber, Sonny Liston(the paper champion) and Foreman and Frazier(who'd they ever beat). Marciano defeated a handful of former World Champions with ease, and yea he never lost a fight."
4,most interesting insight,"This is a intriguing book. An insight into to the man who managed to keep the Spanish Riding School going during World War II and convinve Patton to save the breeder stock at the end of the war. He speaks of the horses that he has riden and trained and what they have taught him! I have enjoyed the book, but some may find it a bit too intellectual. Those who ride, love horses or are interested in the behavior of horses will find this an most intersting and entertaining read!"
2,Missing pieces,"This was supposed to be 2 frames, there were only 3 side bars in the package, making it impossible to have 2 frames!"
2,Good picture but bad sound!,This DVD player has good picture quality and a large screen but the sound is not so good. I had it turned up full blast on an airplane trip and still could barely hear the sound. It just does not get loud enough! The battery life is short and you cannot watch a video and charge the battery at the same time. I would recommend a different brand if you are going to spend the money on a portable DVD player.
2,Not Bad but not very filling,Some good ideas from web site promoters but only a few good ideas. Buy it used.
2,Unoriginal,This book marks the top of the equity and trading bubble. It is in a line of a series of books trying to live off the success of originals such as Market Wizards. Instead of this book just read the original - Market Wizards.
5,*******,"This is to prove that extremely ungracious reviewer wrong. I am not a green beer drinking danny boy singing boob. It is true I sing danny boy but abstain from drinking beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this and I am sure that those who are ""on the fence"" will enjoy this as well. IN MUSICA VERITAS"
3,"haunting, creepy, and sometimes downright weird","This is a pretty strange, creepy movie.The cinematograpy is pretty lavish, with interesting imagery of scattering white flower petals and constantly billowing opaque curtains blowing in the wind at night. The people are all beautiful, if conniving and evil. This movie contains a surprisingly large amount of adult-grade erotic content (lesbian kisses, rape scenes, nudity), so is not one for the kids.Overall, this one makes for an interesting night, and if it just had more character development and a somewhat more sophisticated plot, the luscious imagery, fantastic atmosphere, other various interesting touches would make this film a recommended one in my opinion."
1,"dokken6008, were you drunk when you wrote your review?","Obviously you still think they were hot but are too afraid to come out and say it. If you want to talk about talented young people, listen to Silverchair's ""Frogstomp"". Trixter represents everything that was wrong with music in the late '80s and are nothing but a boy band with guitars. This CD is garbage!!!"
4,nikita the special b-day gift,Really liked the added bonus and the length of time the season runs. My friend was so tickled that I got him this. He just turned 77 years old.
5,A solid and exciting continuation of Nikita's story,"Highly recommended for fans of La Femme Nakita and Alias, and anyone who likes a good spy thriller action story. This show is best watched in sequence."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Don't buy this DVD. They've included some of the exact same sketches already shown on Seasons 1-3 dvds right down to the music performances at the end. On one episode, they showed Another Bad Creation performing. The exact same performance was on Season 2. Just watch it on tv."
4,importante investigacio de comportamiento animal y humano,Una fuente esencial de informacion en el estudio del comportamiento humano la proporcionan las investigaciones realizadas en animales y sobre otras especies de primates.
5,Frankie Beverly & Maze,Excellent DVD. I prefer Los Angeles rather than New Orleans. This DVD was a vibrant one and I watch it every morning before I go to work.
2,Disappointing and of little value,This book is turgid and obtuse. Whatever value there is is hidden within a great deal of verbaige and repetition. I am sorry that this subject which is an important one is made unaccessible to most readers.
5,Iodine and Thyroid Hormone,"This book was a wonderful gift to me.It has helped me understand how the thyroid hormone works and when it doesn't work. Even though the book is about Breast Cancer, it addresses how the thyroid hormone affects our entire body and breast cancer. The interaction between iodine and the cancer is impressive.The book is easy to read, filled with hundreds of literature citations.If you have breast cancer or thyroid problems, this book is a must for you and your physician."
1,stay away from this dvd set,"The title is misleading, this should not be considered a horror collection. I've seen two of the three movies in this collection and rest assured they are not horrific in any way. Look up my review for Demon Lust for more on this movie. I have seen Cremains and I consider it one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have not seen Demoness and I'm sure I never will because if it's from the same people who brought us the other two movies, then I don't want to waste my time watching it."
2,"Exciting, but weak, youth mystery","This story has some pleasant and interesting parts. The basic plot is Herculeah Jones stumbles across a letter that leads her to a mystery.Having grown up on Hardy Boy Mysteries, and having read a number of Nancy Drew Mysteries to my own daughters, I can see the market niche this book is trying to fill, but I don't recommend this book.The biggest problem with the book is for a ""smart"" girl, Herculeah does some really stupid things. The Hardy Boys got into danger, but they were normally fairly careful. (The Hardy Boys' mysteries are better then this, but they did have their own problems.) Herculeah rushes into danger. It is exciting to read about, but in reality Herculeah was doing some stupid things. She could have very easily been dead. She is not a good hero to read about.If you have children who like mysteries, there are better ones to read."
5,WRONG Tracklist In Product Description!!!,"**WRONG Tracklist In Product Description**Karaoke CDG - Hits Of Elvis Presley Volume 1.Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).NOTE: CD cover misprint, does NOT include lyric sheet.The correct songlist is listed below:1.

1,EW!,This is one of the worst shows ever. I can't believe FOX cancelled the AMAZING Tru Calling with the equally amazing Eliza Dushku to put on this piece of garbage.
1,I can't believe this.,"I CANNOT believe that dumb Point pleasant has a DVD out before other shows. It only had like 10 episodes! North Shore, for example, had a whole season 20 episodes and they dont have one out. This is a rip off and should have other FOX shows like NORTH SHORE out on DVD if they are putting this stupid PP show on DVD."
2,Remembered watching this show when i was a kid,"I remembered watching this show as a kid and enjoying it so I thought i would buy the series and see the whole thing. The series started off really interesting, and then continues to go down hill from there and was cancelled after 1 season. Don't bother."
5,LOVE This Show!!!!,"I was extremely upset when FOX cancelled this show! It is truly a compelling gothic drama that I would say is the modern-day Dark Shadows (with the devil's daughter instead of a vampire). As others have written, the chemistry between the actors is great (and let's face it, Grant Show is hot!). I was pulled into the fresh and inventive storyline from the very first episode! Definitely needs to be put back on the air!!!!!!"
4,A fantastic guilty pleasure,"Point Pleasant was not a good show. It just wasn't. The scripts were average, the acting was sub-par at best and comically wooden at worst. The only thing that this show genuiniely had going for it was a fairly clever storyline.That said, Point Pleasant was an absolute pleasure to watch, not in spite of but because of its trashiness. I think the reason that it was such a great guilty pleasure was that the cast (mostly soap opera cast-offs) knew exactly what the show was and didn't take it too seriously (and maybe even played up the cheese factor intentionally), whereas the director(s) seemed to be going for real, genuine drama. The ensuing absurdity was just irresistable, and TV hasn't seen nearly so endearing a piece of schlock sense."
5,Go surf,"Good album. Didn't like whoever ""a music fan from Baltimore"" is. My name is Nick. email me at dominickolas@hotmail.com, write and we can arange for a place where I can bust your obniouxious face."
2,Wait A Month!,"Although I'm tempted to buy one today, I've heard that TrekStor will soon be introducing a 4GB model for under $30,000. I'm going to wait."
5,Sterling Silver Chain,"Very delicate, very pretty chain. It doesn't kink up when I wear it, and it's the perfect length. I have worn this every day since I received it."
1,"1t's 10 years old, and needs to be updated!","This was ok 10 years ago, now in desperate need of updating.One could cut out over half the chatty words, and make a better written 2nd edition. Pictures of settings, garnishing, updated information and recipes, etc would bring it up to snuff with the many other, newer books on entertaining, that you'd be much, much happier with.Mrs. Williamson knew her stuff back then in the 90's when this was written; why embarass yourself entertaining today from this now out of date book, with the style of the 80's and 90's?Better yet, try one of a dozen or so Entertaining books out on the shelves. This is on sale for less than fifty cents for a reason. I would wait for a 2nd edition, rather than settle for this first edition."
4,Gift for my son,"Of what I hear from his room, I too, enjoy this album. Has the songs he wanted to hear on his terms."
4,"Well, ""I'm A Believer"".","The truth is, we need bands like Smash Mouth, we need bands that are fun, and we need good music in the summertime. There are a few bands around similar to Smash Mouth, but I'd honestly take these guys over Sugar Ray in a heartbeat. This is a generous 20 tracks, and includes about everything it should. We get the addictive big hits like ""Walking On The Sun"" and ""All Star"", we get the minor hits like ""Then The Morning Comes"" and ""Pacific Coast Party"", and we get a ton of soundtrack songs and covers. My favorites of those are ""Why Can't We Be Friends"", ""Can't Get Enough Of You Baby"", and ""Getting Better"". I like these guys enough to keep the albums I have, but if you're looking for your first or only Smash Mouth disc, this is obviously it."
5,Whole Family Favorite,"This CD is a must have. Included are their most popular songs. Because of shrek and other movies, this cd is a whole family favorite. The Kids love dancing to the music in this cd. Highly reccomend!"
5,Forza motorsport 2,Good rpg type game.Nice graphics for its age .Racing tracks kind of boring though .It still a good racing game.
4,Good price for a must-have,"I got this game for thirty-some odd bucks on sale. Well worth it, for the multiplayer and the realistic simulation approach.Test-Drive Unlimited is more fun, but nothing on xbox touches Forza for the realism. I can't compare to Gran Turismo, as I haven't touched the series since #2."
5,So much fun,"I love this game. It is so much better than all the other racing simulators I have tried. The graphics are really impressive, the audio is clear and active, and the game play is wonderful, both online and off. I have only played for several hours at this point, both online and off and both have been wonderful. The Career mode is great, with ability to tweak and upgrade my cars all the time. Multiplayer is really fun since you can compete with people with similar skill and car levels.I highly recommend this game."
4,Take It From A Non-Racing Fan...,"Forza 2 is worth the money. I've never been one to get all that interested in racing games, so I was a bit skeptical about this one to say the least. I was proven very wrong, however. The night I began playing hours just rolled by completely unnoticed, which I consider a true sign of a great game. The only thing I can think of that's somewhat bad is the soundtrack, but if you've got some songs loaded onto your hard drive it doesn't really matter, does it? Racing fan or not, check this one out."
5,Excellent Racing Sim,approximately 300 licensed cars. a wide variety of playable tracks. Some of the best graphics seen in a racing game. The most realistic racing gameplay ever. very realistic damaging. This is the most impressive racing game ive ever seen.
1,I hate racing games... came free with my XBox 360.,I got this game free when I purchased the XBox 360 Elite... and I did play it for a bit just to see what it was like... and it wasn't very fun. The first 10 minutes are great... but after that I'm done. I just really don't like racing games.
1,Not realisitc,"I got one 360 just to play Forza 2, happens I got really disapointed with the game when I saw fake shadows and reflections on cars, for example, put the game to run some replay and keep the camera view in back of car, then pay attention to shadows and other details :(Also, damages are very arcade, even em Simulation mode, the car never loose big quantity of components when involved in accident.Disapointing was also the fact all cars seems to slizze on road, even with sport tyres and all wings to help grip, far from reality.Overall, its fun for the body painting and prize/reward system as we progress but the game is far from other simulator titles as GTR2 (PC) or (GT5)."
4,Wii,"WiiThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight PrincessMy girls (12 and a pair of 7 year olds) received this for Christmas. My 74 year father and 45 year old brother took it over to play golf after being trounced by on of the twins in bowling. The girls have even more fun creating Miis. The Zelda game is too difficult for the twins but the 12 year old can't seem to get enough of it. I love the fact they can ""rediscover"" their older Game Cube games. Once school began I used the incitement of playing on the Wii to get homework finished in record time. I would buy this again ...."
4,Wii from a boomer's viewpoint,"Could not find a console anywhere within 200 miles of home - Walmart, Bestbuy, etc. were all out of stock. Ordered from Amazon and had it in my hands the next morning! Easy to set up. Easy to use. Fun for one or a crowd, ANY age. Wii Fit gives me a decent workout in the privacy of my own home and I love the real feedback and tracking."
4,Review of nintindo WI,I think the WII is one of the better games because of the overallinteraction the children do with the game rather than just siton the couch and play for hours.
2,just a gimmick,"Well, the Wii is a good console, but the motion controls work poorly and the games are for 3 year olds. Kirby's Epic YARN?!?!?!?! Get a PS3 unless your 2. If you want motion controls, wait for the sony move."
5,An addictive gaming system,"I seriously love this gaming system. I'm a 29-year old woman who hasn't played Nintendo since the 80s and early 90s. I recently had some great memories of playing Zelda, and found out that the Wii can download lots of old games (even from Sega and other gaming systems) for around $5-10 each. I immediately got a Wii---I have seriously been hooked ever since. The Wii Sports games (and Sports Resort) are very fun to get started, but then I got some of my first exercise titles (Wii Fit Plus and about 10 others), and it was over for me. I look forward to working out with the Wii daily in ways that I could never feel about going to the gym, and I've lost weight, gotten pretty toned, and gotten some youthful 'zest' back in the process. Most of my titles are exercise, singing, and dancing games...and now I'm really enjoying the time I do spend at home. I am really glad I made this purchase."
4,Basic Wii package,We ordered this basic Wii package and it shipped as advertised and arrived on time a couple of days before Christmas. We have played it a lot and everything that all the reviews before me said is definitely true. The video display is good although i am using the lower quality video cable and have not gotten the HDMI cable yet so it may improve when I get the better cable. I got the sport game pack and one controller with it. My wife and I played it for a few days (we are both in our 50's) with one controller and had to get a second controller to make it easier to play. Having to share a controller is a pain. And some of the games really can't be played by two without a second controller so plan on getting that. I highly recommend this game console as it makes a couch potato get up to play it so any movement is good!
3,A Fun Toy for the casual gamer,"I bought the wii from Amazon in January 2007. I sold it on Ebay in July 2008. But that does not mean the wii is bad. I am what you could call a hardcore gamer. For me hidef graphics and sound, strong gameplay mechanics and deep plotlines are key factors in enjoying a game. Also I prefer to play my games alone, without interference from family or friends!!! So I guess I am not the target demographic for this console. I did however enjoy a few games that managed to hold my attention for more than a few hours. First was Super Paper Mario and the next was Metroid Prime 3. Once I finished those two though, the motivation to continue owning a wii vanished. I wish Nintendo would use all the profits they made with the wii to design a truly next gen console that will please both hardcore and casual gamers alike."
5,TO MUCH FUN TO HANDLE!!:) BUY IT NOW~!~,if this isnt the best peice of technology ever i dont know what is! this make tennis & boxing and spongebob & driving and cooking and surgery SO MUCH FUN!!!! it is like its real!forget about PS3 and Xbox 360This takes gaming to a whole new level.!>you will not be dissapointed!
5,"Excellent, 5 stars.","I purchased this system on luanch night, and nintend, I say kudos. The graphics are not as well as I'd hoped, but the innovative gameplay makes up for it. the Wiimote feels very natural in your palm, and all the actions are simple and intuitive. I bought Zelda along with this game, and felt as if I actually had the sword in my living room! Again, the grpahics are not the best, but do graphics honestly matter? I say, If you are looking for a great console with awesome gamplay, go for the Wii. If you want HD and good grpahics, go for the PS3 or XBox 360."
3,"Wii, Blessing or bomb?","I Played this at my freind's house and LOVED it! I think though that there are MANY things that aren't that great about it, first off there's the fact that the technical specs are [...]. Then there's the fact that there isn't really a ""right"" way to hold both the nunchuck and th Wiimote at the same time. overall though, it's loads of fun to play and ""rayman, raving rabbids"" is addictive. I think that the novelty of the motion sensing tech could get old. would rather have a ps3."
5,Great fun!,I bought my Wii the first day it came out and I still play it constantly. More and more great games are coming out through Nintendo and the Virtual Console. I highly recommend buying one if you like having fun.
4,98% awesome 2% bad,"I got this wii and got lots of games now I almost have thirty and I have had it for more than a year but it started to not read the disk i went to fix it, but that didn""t work but it finally started to work but the worst thing of all that made me flip out was that it started to SCRATCH the disk and I had to buy new ones and start all over again."
5,The ultimate party game,"The Wii is a social game, unlike PS3 or Xbox360 playing the Wii on your own is not really much fun. It really comes into its own when you have a friend or friends over and everyone takes turns on the sports and other games.I think we paid for the Wii in the number of bowling games we've had out of it alone."
4,"Seriously, I'm Back Into Video Games...","I'm older, 27, and have a job and a social life. I don't have or will make the energy to spend studying games hardcore, I just want some simple fun and then I'm out. This system in my opinion perfect for my needs. I'm familiar with old school nintendo games so when I bought Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it has such a nostaligic goodness feeling to it. Plus they introduced me to their new characters- I had no idea what Pikmin was before. Plus I can buy cheap gamecube games and play them (I never owed a cube) and so I have gotten FZero Gx, Pikmin, Rouge Squadron, and Metroid Prime for about $30 total. (Though I must admit I haven't really played them- damn you nintendo for your great marketing). I also bought Bomberman 93 (similar to the Snes one) and had a nice bomberman party with four wii controllers. Just to end it quick, but this system is cool, cheap, quick fun!!!"
5,Amazing..,I recently got a Wii after waiting so long to get it and tired of hearing it was sold out everywhere. It's so worth it.. It's an amazing product and it definitely changes the way you play. THe controller is somewaht sensitive but not in a bad way. It's the most amazing console I've experienced with. I love it and hope you make the most out of it.
5,Fun for the family,"This is a gaming system which is fun for the whole family. Even adults who don't usually get into playing video games will enjoy this. Playing Wii Sports is easy and enjoyable. The kids also got Wario Ware and plan to get Zelda. Internet browsing on a computer is much better than on the Wii, but it's a nice option to have for just casual browsing when you're not near a pc. You probably need to get at least one extra Wii remote and you definitely need to buy extra batteries. We got NIMH rechargeables. I liked buying from Amazon as they are a trusted seller and delivery was within a reasonable time frame. I didn't have to wait in a long line!"
2,"Ok system, horrible library.",Almost all of the third party software for the console are awful. It is a shame that Nintendo does not have a screening process for software products licensed for their system like Microsoft and Sony do. But even first party titles like Super Mario Galaxy and Mario Kart Wii are very disappointing.
2,Freezing Up On Me!,"I am very, very, very frusrated. I've been waiting to get the Wii for a long time now. Then me and my mom ordered it off of amazon and when we got it (Yesterday) we hooked it up right away! I had fun playing it for about 30 minutes...until it started freezing up on me! The first time it did that, I turned of the Wii, TV system and DVD/VCR player. I un-plugged the power and turned everything back on and played it again. It lasted about 5 minutes. So I had to call Tech Support and now were getting a new Wii-only its USED and $5 more! They should be giving US money for the frustration. All together I am frustrated, annoyed, and upset."
5,Wii..,"First off it is AWESOME..My brother got a ps3 for christmas and I thought it was cool until I got the Wii.. I love how the Wii actually puts you in the game. And beleive me you will not get bored with it. It has wireless Internet which is great and it cuts down on the cords. Next, the Wiimote fits perfectly in your hands.(Be sure to wear the wrist strap!!! Especially if your hands sweat alot). Last, quit going on Ebay and paying about $350 for a Wii. It's rediculous, just call the stores near you and see if they have one and then check back in with them. That's how i got mine. Well, hope you enjoyed my review and it persuaded you to buy a Nintendo Wii instead of the Xbox 360 or PS3."
5,Quality and easy to use system,Good product to have for all age groups. Very user friendly and easy to figure out compared to other gaming systems.
5,Wii review,This is the best game that I have ever played. The shipment was on time and I would score amazon service as 10 in a scale from 0 to 10. I'm satisfied! you guys are the best!
5,Got to have a Wii,"If you must have a gaming console it has to be a Wii, of course you can get the others, but this one is much fun, yeah more storage or better graphics from the other guys, but nintendo does gaming like they only can, not like the other guys involved with everything else (sony, microsoft). The Miis are a fun way to get everybody invloved in the game and guess what it plays all the gamecube stuff too"
2,Dust collector after a month,"I bought a wii because I'm not a serious gamer and just wanted something fun and simple to play. Maybe I got suckered in by the hunt for the hard to find wii or maybe by its cute little white case. Heres the deal though: Nobody is making any good games for this console. And all the games that use the wii's gyroscope tech. suck. If you have a tv over 32"" forget this machine. I have a 1080P 46"" lcd and it looks pathetic. The wii only outputs 480p. Right now your best bet is gonna be a xbox 360. It outputs 1080p, streaming high def netflix, super online play with other people and tons and tons of great games. Luckily I was able to sell my wii on craigslist while they were still hard to find and I immediately went and got a 360. The wii is a novelty and nothing more. Please don't get sucked into the hype, you will regret it."
2,I received the product offered,Waiting excitedly Wii console and when we received was not what was ordered. Decia include Wii Sports and it was totally a hoax. It brought them included. So to date I could not use it.
3,save money for xbox,wii is ok but xbox is much better and has better games.and my friend he'll say the same thing. and it works better than wii
3,Fun for some. Not for me,"Bought it as a gift for someone. Don't care much for it and the person who I gifted it to was not that enthralled after the novelty wore off. Then again, it's not a knock against the games or platform if I consider this to be a proxy review. He probably simply is not interested in video games. If you're a casual gamer or a senior that needs to do something that involves some activity with fun to boot (YMMV), then it's a good platform. But with Kinect and Move, I'm not sure how it stacks up.The Wii Fitness and fitness related games were one advantage of the Wii platform. If they still are (given the games), then it might still be a good buy. At the risk of sounding like a teen fanboy, I prefer my PS3 & XBox."
5,Wii game console,"Nintendo hit the ball out of the park with this unit. It's perfect for the whole family, young and old.It's one of the best purchases I have ever made!"
5,Wii game system,this is a fun gaming system. It's very easy to learn to play and looks very realistic
5,Addicting!!!,So much fun for everyone in my family. We play Rayman and Elebits with the kids and after they are in bed we are hooked on Zelda. The sports game that comes with it is also a lot of fun!
4,Very Fun,"The Nintendo Wii is a load of fun and cool motions, but Nintendo could have done a better job on their graphics. Now most of the time I dont care about graphics, but in the seventh generation of gaming you would itleast figure Nintendo would take it up a notch. The controls will somtimes miss also. This could make you lose your last life on a game or get a game over. About 97% of the time the controls do work properly. This is a fun, exciting game console for the family, but its one of those systems that is for mostly non-gamers. But even though I am a game freak, I still play my Wii. Nintendo should have definatly released more games at launch, but the Wii still keeps you entertained. For just $249.99, this game is definatly worth it."
4,Nintendo brings out.....the Wii!!!!!!,"Pros:-The controls use real motion controls which was something great to add-Easy to install (at least for us it was!)-Huge selection of games-Many featuresCons:-Has a weird glitch problem which you then must eject the disc and turn of your wii (other words, the wii freezes). It might not happen to your wii but it does for mine-The motion controls not sensitive enoughOverall, the Wii is a great gaming console to have and it would be especially fun for families."
5,Definitely worth it,"I am a big fan of the wii, I love the controls and the selection of games. I considered a PS3 becuase I love my PS2, but I realized that I love the games I played on the PS2. This is why I chose the wii, with games like Mario Galaxy and Wii Fit how can you go wrong? I definitley recommend this even if you do not have a family, I am taking it over to a friends house this weekend to play Rayman Raving Rabbids and we are sure to have a ball.Definitely not for hard core gamers, stick with the XBOX 360 or the PS3, those game titles are designed for you, the wii's game titles are definitely geared towards casual/platform gamers. A fun time is to be had by all when playing the Wii, give it a shot, like I said its worth the price."
4,A Great Tool to Keep fit and Have Fun,"The Nintendo Wii competes favorably with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. The design is quite straightforward offering ease of operation. The remotes have been designed to reduce slipping out from the hands and damaging the remote or other objects that may be neraby, such as the TV. This protection is increased as the players use the attachable wrist strap. The Wii is popular for its concept of helping to keep the body moving, working and buring the calories, while playing games. This has been a great selling feature. However, as a parent, I noticed that my kids will play the sports games while I am around, but resort to the fingers-only games when I am away. So, it will be unrealistic for consumers to think that the Nintendo Wii will magically solve their exercise problems. They will need the same amount of self-determination that they will need in going to the gym on a regular basis[Nwankama Nwankama]"
1,wii pretty boring after a while,I bought this thing last month and after playing it for a while i thought man this thing is better than the ps3 and the xbox 360. sure is fun but after a while it gets boring. i played zelda and wii sports and they got boring after a while. so i decided to give it to my little cousin and stick up with my ps3 and my xbox 360. maybe in the feture i will buy it again but if it has pretty cool games right now it sucks.
5,Really Fun,"The wii is really fun. you get wii sports with the wii.In wii sports, you play baseball, golf, tennis, bowling, and boxing.In baseball, golf, tennis, and Bowling you use the wii remote and boxing you need the numchuck and the wii remote.IN wii sports, there is training,where you train to play the normal sports. There is also Fitness testing where you do a 3 sports and they tell you how old you are.The wii sports is pretty fun but after you play a lot, it gets really repetative and gets boring.Not like other consles, you can shake and wave the remote, you can actually get some exercise.I really like the WIi."
5,Required Play for All Ages!,"As someone who is old enough to remember when the original NES came out and all thru the Nintendo line, this is easily the best thing since sliced bread! I have experience with Play Station, too, but Wii really hit the mark. You can download all the old games (subject to availability as they come out on Monday nights) and the Wii will connect wirelessly thru a broadband wireless router to the Internet, allowing you to get the weather from all over the world as well as headlines. You can download the Opera browser and surf the web and there is even a way to message other Wii users using a unique serial number. The remote might take some getting used to, but my fifty year old mother in law who bowled for twenty years in a league jumped right in to the virtual bowling game a rolled a 150 on her first try. My five year old niece also picked it up pretty quickly. There's no question that this is totally worth it, I just wish I had gotten one sooner!"
5,"Wii,wii sport",Have very much enjoyed the Wii. It is a great way to interact with the family and now just sit in front of the TV and veg.
5,Not just for kids,Product was delivered promptly. The Wii provides hours of entertainment for adults as well as kids - this takes gaming to a whole new dimension with the remote control. LOVE IT
3,Great System,"When Nintendo announced that they were making a new Gaming Console, I freaked! I've always been a Nintendo FanBoy if I must say. When Nintendo released the WII, I felt that it would defintely remind me of the ""Nintendo 64"" and ""Nintendo GameCube"" however that was not the case.As you can tell by my rating, I enjoyed the system, I just think Nintendo attempted to take the cheap way out and thought thay people wouldn't notice it. Fans allowed Nintendo to pass the GC off without a dvd player, but the Wii is missing several critical components, regardless of people having 5 to 6 DVD players around the house, which consist of Pc's, dvd players, Blu Ray, and etc, it's always better to give fans the most for the money.Also the Controller gimmick got really tired, really quick. I sold my WII to gamestop and that was the end, I'll join back up with Nintendo next generation."
3,wii is fun but not for everyone,"i got a wii and the system is pretty impressive.. if you are like me who spoiled his eyes with all this ""high def games"" in the 360 then it wont be as ""shocking"" as you would expect it to be. So far the controls are not that perfect especially in third party games like monkey ball and red steel, unless you don't mind playing wii sports for the next couple of months then it wont be a problem for you. there is one game that i am very impressed with and it is Rayman.. overall get the system cuz its dead cheap (the same price as PSP) with rayman... but dont put high hopes for it.. if you don't have any of the next gen systems and you are a fan of racing, FPS and GTA... wii (currently) is not your choice..."
1,Disappointed or Confused,"Unless I'm really Confused, this product does not work! It did not come with directions & had to go on YouTube to make sure I set it up properly. Needless to say, It did not load or read the disc I bought new from Gamestop. The one game that did work, I couldn't get passed the Main Menu?"
4,Wii Can all Have fun!,"I took the Wii with my family down to visit relatives for thanksgiving and everyone was hooked! From the youngsters to the older folks, everyone found wii sports entertaining and fun if not close to cardio!We also have Rayman and NFL2k7(that ones for dear old dad) both which make great use of the controllers.My oldest daughters 9 and 6 really like the bowling and tennis and want me to now buy them Ant Bully.If the software companies continue to put out innovative gaming experiences for the Wii I can see how this can be the beginning of change in how we play video games."
3,Entertaining but Poor Graphics,The nice about this system is that it makes you workout if you play the sports game and gives you the feeling of a fighter when it comes to fighting games etc...the thing that I didn't care for are the graphics which are not that good compared to the PS3 and the 360.all in all it is a high tech attractive system but not for harcore gamers.
3,Missing games,The delivered package did not contain the games package that is standard with the wii. :(
5,Great,"It came with absolutely everything necessary, works perfectly. Simply put, awesome. This is why I wait for technology to get cheaper, it feels more like a victory."
3,after getting an expert,after getting an expert we got it to work but one controle didn't work untill we call upon the gods and do a rain dance or something
5,Best system on the market,Great entertainment and it keeps my kids active while they play! Great system! Love it!
5,Wii Console,Well built and lots of fun. My son decided to trade it in for an X-box 360 and I actually miss playing the arcade games on it. I'm thinking of buying another one for myself :)
5,a great book about the evolution of saltwater fly fishing.,This book is outstanding. Anyone who has been bitten by the bug of saltwater fly fishing can relate to the struggle of the author's early days of fly fishing in the Florida backcountry. We are fortunate that Flip Pallot dedicated so much of his time to learning and perfecting the art of saltwater fly fishing so that we can learn quicker without re-inventing the wheel. The photographs are as good as the writing which makes this book an immediate favorite of any fisherman.
2,Getting less for your money,"Weak writing, name dropping and a few rather insipid childhood memories, coupled with photos that occaisonally have something to do with the stories are the highlights of this book. Destined to be on the bargain tables of Borders and Barnes and Noble for the holiday season."
2,I re-reviewed the book,"Recently I received an email message from one of the editors of this book, criticizing me for my negative review (see ""Getting less for your money""). Some quotes from the editor to me were: ""your comments were mean-spirited"", and ""I hope Flip never reads your review, because if he does, he will never share his secrets with the public again"".Her reaction was so strong, I decided to read the book again to see if I'd missed something. Well, I hadn't. This remains a book that can't figure out if it's a story book or a picture book. The text relies too much on name-dropping to try to hold readers' interest rather than on strong story telling, and the photos seem to be a mish-mosh of strong visual images that try, in my opinion, to detract the reader from the weak writing. If you want a good saltwater fly fishing book to read when you can't get out to the flats yourself, try ""West of Key West"", instead.2 stars again."
5,Not just for seniors,"My wife has this video. While the video shows seniors doing these exercises this is for people of all ages who want to improve their physical health. It's a good introduction to get started with yoga or general exercise. The exercises are for improving mobility, strength and balance. The exercises are simple, and the demonstrations are very useful in teaching the proper poses."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I've had good experiences with DM shoes, but these boots are disappointing. The sole is rugged and cushiony, and the toe cap and heel counter are of good sturdy leather, but the tongue and uppers are of tissue paper thin, flimsy leather. The boots feel much bigger than DM shoes of the same size (UK 9) and slide around uncomfortably on my feet even with extra thick wool socks, and they offer absolutely no ankle support whatsoever. A padded tongue and collar, and perhaps thicker leather uppers, would be improvements. I might also wish that Docs came in half sizes, as buying these a half size smaller might take care of some of my concerns."
4,Great text,"Another one of the essentials in my view. Great pictures and explanations on approaches to bones and joints. Compliments ""Small animal Orthopaedics and Fracture Repair""."
4,Great guitarist - Mediocre Instructor,There are true gems to be mined in this instructional video from Eliot Fisk. Excellent insights into Segovia's approach to playing and his influence on the world of classical guitar. Some of the tips I enjoyed were the ones on arpeggios and vibrato. The only problem I have with Fisk's presentation is that he seems too focused on dazzling his viewers with his playing and not focused enough on bringing the viewer up to his level of proficiency. This video is not for beginning guitarists or even beginning classical guitarists. You need at least an intermediate skill level and probably an advanced one to benefit from it. If you simply want to watch one of Segovia's former students display the skills he learned from the maestro then you'll probably love it.
4,"Not as good as the first, but still worthwhile","This is the sequel to LouAnne Johnson's ""My Posse Don't Do Homework"" (or ""Dangerous Minds""--retitled). It follows the same format as the first book, but I didn't think it was as good. I felt like she wrote the book because the first one got such great reviews, but this one fell short. Although it is titled ""The Girls in the Back of the Class,"" I didn't feel as though it focused enough on the girls in the back of the class. Don't get me wrong, it was still a good read with amazing experiential stories, but not as good as the first one."
5,All Aboard for Fun.....,"""Thursday was a day much like any other for Jesse. Trains and dinosaurs. Dinosaurs and trains. Just before bed, Jesse drew one last picture. Suddenly there was a loud noise and the whole house began to shake..."" Hop aboard! From the dining car, to the sky window, to the tunnel up ahead and more, join Jesse and his prehistoric friends for the ride of a lifetime on the dinosaur train..... John Steven Gurney really captures the essence of young dinosaur and train lovers in this endearing little picture book. His simple text is kept to a minimum, as he lets his vibrant and evocative artwork tell the story. Each dazzling two-page spread engages, and is filled with bold color, playful details, and marvelous facial expressions, that will captivate little ones, and send imaginations soaring. Perfect for preschoolers, Dinosaur Train is a read-aloud crowd pleaser, and is sure to become an instant favorite at your house."
3,"Cute, but more for little ones","This is a cute book with nice, colorful pictures. However, I felt the simplicity of this book is really more for little kids 3 and under."
5,The Compost Pile is Working,These guys are busy in the compost pile and all seems to be working well.
1,Do not order worms during the summer,"I have to accept a certain amount of responsibility on this one, it isn't hard to figure out. Do not buy worms during the summer. They are shipped in a box. The box will heat up during shipping and the worms will die. You will receive a very expensive box of dead worms.For the vendor, no warning is given about this. If you want to give them money they will send worms to you.Caveat Emptor."
1,WORST COMPANY EVER,"Do not order from Uncle Jim's Worm Farm. They are the worst internet company ever. They have ZERO customer service and they lied to me. I placed an order on Gardenworms.com and as soon as I had paid, a window popped up that said ""thank you for shopping at Uncle Jim's."" Advertising deception. Within 10 minutes of placing that order I called and cancelled it. The person on the phone said it was cancelled. I have been emailing and calling for 10 days, and cannot get a credit or cancellation confirmation. Today I received the shipment in the mail. I returned it unopened. It remains to be seen if I will ever get a credit. They have not answered my repeated emails and requests for credit. The person on the phone who I have talked to twice said it would be done. 95% of the time they don't even answer the phone. DON'T ORDER FROM GARDENWORMS.COM OR UNCLE JIM'S WORM FARM."
5,Feeling Worm and Fuzzy,"Worms are smaller than I had thought, but after two weeks, I've noticed a big difference in their growth, and they seem very active. Out of no fault of Uncle Jim, my own postal worker didn't leave pkg at the door, so the worms spent an extra night at the post office until I was able to retrieve them the following day. Even with that extra delay, the worms seemed very healthy. Will buy from again!"
5,Company makes good their promises,"My order was placed the week before Thanksgiving. Good to their word they sent out the worms on Monday. Unfortunately, due to the holiday my worms arrived two days after the holiday and most were dead. I called and they sent out another order - no questions asked. This time they were healthy and active. I will definitely order all my worms from Uncle Jim's."
5,Great product for a better world,"I'll admit it, I'm not a 'creepy crawly' fan, but I'm committed to trying to reduce the amount of waste I landfill. So with trepidation, I bought a prefab worm-farm and these worms.The worms came quickly, and no, I wasn't emotionally prepared even though the worm farm was ready for them. Fortunately, the worms came as described in a cloth bag in a box along with some damp bedding. I had no trouble getting my new little eco-buddies into their home and off to a great start.It's been two full months now, and I'm much more comfortable with my worms. I'm thrilled I'm able to do this little bit for the planet, and I can't wait until I have piles of the best plant-growing soil ever for my meager yard and few potted plants.Even if you're squeamish to get started, don't wait. It's doable."
3,A little late,"It took them about 2 weeks to ship my package. I think they forgot about me. But, once they did, it arrived fine. Worms are now eating all my kitchen scraps."
4,GROWING SLOW BUT SURE,"I RECEIVED THE WORMS IN GOOD CONDITION, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE, BUT THAT WAS JUST WISHFUL THINKING. I CHECK THEM EVERY WEEK AND AM STARTING TO SEE THE LITTLE EGG CASES. I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER THEM TOO MUCH NOW, IT IS OUR WINTER AND EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE INSIDE, WHERE THEY ARE STAYS IN THE 60'S. I'LL BE EAGER TO SEE NEXT SPRING JUST HOW MUCH THEY HAVE MULTIPLIED. YOURFIENDNTHECOUNTRY, GARY"
3,"Basic advice, nice quotes","Don't eat fast food, fats or sugar. Control your portion size. Drink water. Sleep. Don't skip a meal. Exercise a few times a week. Write a food dairy. Set reasonable weight loss goals.52 basic advices we should all follow but mainly don't. You will find nothing new in this book nor will have scientific nutritional knowledge that will somehow transform your diet from unhealthy to healthy. You will not get a program to follow, a list of foods to eat or avoid, nor recipes.You do get the advice, quotes, ideas, questions you might want to ask and sensible answers. As a motivational tool, it might work. It will also keep you from fad diets, fasting, diet-pills and get-thin-quickly schemes. Not too shabby for a freebie.Written in the UK, it uses references that sound quite medieval. I don't know how much a stone weights but I'm pretty sure I could stand to loose a few ! I'll be sure to give the author good advice a try..."
1,Nothing new here. The premise? Drink water! Duh!,"I thought I was getting a free book for my Kindle. It seems I paid a dollar to read a few unedited pages of self-published, poor writing style to read that hunger pangs may come from dehydration and to try water before eating food. Very unimpressed."
3,"""Thomas Jefferson: Philosopher of Freedom""","""Thomas Jefferson: A View From the Mountain""This is a documentary, that seems to be focused on the ""dark side"" of Jefferson, yet it really fails to stress the inner struggle he endured regarding this issue of slavery. It's a little hard to swallow in some respects, though it does illustrate the more human side of the man. It's not the quality as Ken Burns' ""Jefferson"", and seems a little too focused on only one aspect of his life.It's ok as a ""filler"" to some of the mystique surrounding this pivotal character, but will not be on my ""Highly Recommended"" list."
2,Too small,Could be used as a condiment cup but certainly not for baking. Go for the individual 5'' or 6'' plate if you are looking for a single/ double portion size pie pan.
1,Horrible,"Our dog recently died and this book was recommended. I ordered it from Amazon (used) and it came in great shape for a great price.However, I do not feel that reading this book to my kids is going to help them with the grief of their pet. In the book, the boy's dog is run over by a neighbor's car. It's a very ""old school"" book and that is probably why it is out of print. Keep looking."
5,Freud hole cutter,Freud cutters are better than average hole cutters to make splinter free holes in your wood working project. What a great cutter.
5,Another great score by a great composer!,"Another great score by Patrick Williams - a composer who deserves more recognition! Though known and honored by most musicians, film/tv buffs, and professionals - general population should learn of his genius and amazing contributions!"
5,Exquisite music - correct sheet music,"This collection of sheet music only contains six of the thirteen Barcarolles of Gabriel Fauré. (Les Troisième Barcarolles). It is, nevertheless, well worth the price.I first heard these compositions some thirty five years ago (1971) when Jean Phillipe Collard released his first recording. His first recording was in 1971 just after he won the Gabriel Fauré competition in France (at the incredible age of 21). I believe there is still no finer recording.The recording is available on Amazon but only from independent sources.Here are the six barcaroles in this collection of sheet music. The music is clear, readable and professionally reproduced.No. 1 In A Minor, Op.26No. 2 In G Major, Op.41No. 3 In G Flat Major, Op.42No. 4 In A Flat Major, Op.44No. 5 In F Sharp Minor, Op.66No. 6 In E Flat Major, Op.70Fauré's compositions are not for beginners, but, despite their introspective complexity, even pianists of moderate achievements can play them."
2,Durable but doesn't cut well,"I purchased these blades because the inexpensive plastic ""spacers"" that come with other inexpensive clippers kept wearing down where they connect to the clipper and would start falling off.While these metal blades have eliminated that problem, they just don't cut well. They miss hairs, so you have to go over and over the same area, and you still might find a couple long hairs uncut later. I've never had this problem with the inexpensive clippers with their plastic spacers."
3,Pollini at his best,"This is an extraordinary DVD. The music is excelent, Pollini is at his best level ever. I have really enjoyed it."
2,After few months of use.,"I bought this wiper after reading good reviews. I believed that a company with such good name will make good product. It was very good initially and I was happy that I bought it. After few months of use, It feels like good name of BOSCH is worthless at least for wiper blades. It is not doing what it is supposed to do. I am hesitant to use it at times; instead of cleaning water it spreads it.With price so high of premium product, I wonder why they made this product if they can not maintain premium quality? They made this wiper just for the sake of it.I feel like I was fool to buy. I will never buy this product from BOSCH and definitely think thrice before deciding on any BOSCH product."
2,Disappointed,"Similar to another reviewer, I was initially very pleased with these wipers only to be later disappointed. I installed a set of them on my wife's car in mid-November and they worked great. However, by mid-February, they were streaking so severely that I had to replace them after just 4 months. We live in the Northern California bay area and have not had much rain until recently and the wipers never experienced snow. I will not buy another set of wipers from this company."
2,Excellent Rain Wiper,"UPDATE: This wiper did not stand up to the test of time well. Lowering rating to 2 stars. It streaks and smears excessively and its only been a couple months since I installed it. Maybe if my car was garaged it would last longer..---I got my car used and it had these wipers already installed. After a while the driver's side did begin to streak a bit, but I don't know how long the wiper had been there. I think the issue started when some leaves collected under the wiper and I didn't bother to clear it for a few days. I decided to replace it with the same type so that it would match the passenger side, but also because its performance is excellent and the appearance is attractive. It is always completely silent and when they're in good condition the wipes are completely streakless and dry.I ordered from Amazon last night and received it today (wow). The install procedure literally took about 5-10 seconds on my 2000 Grand Prix."
3,Songs left out,"Why do they do this? They take an outstanding movie with outstanding songs and then leave some of the best ones off the soundtrack. This is so infuriating! The song ""Gee"" by the Crows was so integral to the movie they gave that scene over two minutes, yet it was left off the soundtrack. To make matters worse, not only was ""The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane"" by the Whiffles left off the soudtrack, it was cut from the released version of the movie. This was by far the best version I have ever heard of this song. Thank God the USA station includes it in their version. This is why I only give this soundtrack three instead of five stars. Can you imagine ""American Graffiti"" with half of its songs missing? Simply criminal."
4,This CD is great! - mostly,"I am blown away by this CD. It is a great mix of good and not so good. My mom loves Native American music and would probably flip if she heard this CD. My mom would probably like most of it, lets say: 95% of it (like I do), but not all of it. This is a great CD for those who love Native American music and wish only to hear more of it."
4,tight album,i've always been a huge fan of New Edition and this album was cool. vocally NE was knocking it out of the box. this album was one of my favorites back in 88.srong vocals and production. songs were also on point. classic New Edition all the way.
5,The picture doesn't do it justice!,"When I opened the box I was totally impressed. I purchased the watch for the alarms. I get busy during the day and forget to take some meds that I need four times per day. The alarms are perfect. The gold tone bezzle is shiny, not flat as it shows in the picture. It fits my needs to the tee. I would have given it six stars if I could."
4,Good product for the Price,"Bought this because it was the cheapest thing I could find that was waterproof to 100 meters, all metal and would update itself at night.Very happy with the overall performance and appearance.Have received several complements about having a ""nice"" watch.This is my first analog watch in a long time and I wish it had numbers to indicate the time instead of just 12 marks.The display is so small it is difficult to see the day of week and date.The backlight is useless at low light levels. In bright light you can read the dials. In total darkness the dials glow enough to see. In low light conditions the hands don't glow enough to allow you to read the time. The backlight lights the entire face and you can't distinguish the hands clearly. It would be better to have indiglo on the digital display instead or in addition."
4,Pretty good deal,"I got this yesterday and was very impressed. It has lots of cool features. My favorite part is the hand motion while using the stop watch or setting the time zone. The other three dials on the face are; Top: stop watch mode only, Middle: battery level, Bottom: 24-hour clock. Theres still tons that I havent figured out yet like the automatic light that turns on when you move your wrist to look at it.Pros: Looks really cool, tons of features, fairly light weight, the led light is a gold color that was surprisingly neatCons: The band is pretty plain, the inside face is a tad more purple than in the picture, the gold ring on the outside of the face is more silver than gold but isn't that big of deal, and my least favorite part is that its thicker than I would like. I'm no watch expert but this one is pretty thick and you can't tell that from the picture"
2,No A/C adapter or charger ... what's with that?,The unit was delivered quickly. It came fully charged and with all the features advertised. But you might assume it would come with a power cord so you can keep it charged from an A/C outlet. Wrong. I now have to buy one.
1,Some good descriptions but confusing overall,Some of the examples in the book are pretty good but for the most part it jumps from subject to subject. Definately not good for beginners and an experienced J2ME programmer would probably find this book to be way off track.
3,Underwhelming stunner shows heart bursting promise,"3 1/2Carrying the torch of such minimal maestros as composer Arvo Part, this beautiful, meditative piece of neo-classical music flows nicely as an album but hardly digs as deep as some of the more profound moments powerfully demonstrate. The lush piano and violin centered minimalism begins and ends with the most powerful ""sketches"", as most of the remaining brief half hour mulls over a few melodic themes while interspersing appropriate spoken word to this strange little disc. A unique, at times sacred experience onto itself, the fleshed out tracks still massively outshine the constant filler, albeit filler of a supremely classy order."
5,Great UK Punk,"The Swell Maps are an aquired taste for sure but it you are into authentic UK Punk for the 70's then you will love the Swell Maps. The case was cracked upon arrival, but I got a discounted priced. I got in 5 days of ordering it."
5,Definitive...Incredible,"This recording is definitive of the whole punk/new wave sound. Its right up there with ""Nevermind the Bullocks..."" Incredible."
1,Burns almost everything!!,"I bought these needing good baking sheets for everyday use. I have found that they heat up too quickly and unevenly, so that when making things like cookies the tops are still uncooked and the bottoms are burnt. Or one half of the cookies will be burnt and the other half will still be ok. They are way too unpredicable. They are non-stick, however."
5,Awesome!!,Dave Attell is one of the best comedians I love his stand up and I love this show. You love Dave Attell you must own this DVD.
2,Sort-of ok,"I used this stuff in my RV toilet so I wouldn't have to use my precious fresh water to rinse my waste away. Double plastic bags in the toilet bowl works really well. Unfortunately, this stuff is not only expensive, it only marginally works. It does turn urine into a gel but it is poor at odor control and not just for solid waste. The urine stinks and the rv bath stinks. I use pine cat litter instead and it works really well. No odor with the pine litter for either solid or liquid and it absorbs the liquid much better than this stuff. And it is a lot cheaper."
2,Very fast delivery! Great low prices! And perfect condition!,"The game is for kids alone.Its not fun enough to play for grown ups.Very repetitive game,gets boring fast.Not the same plot as the movie."
4,NOT SURE,Well my daughter seemed to like this toy but I guessed she received too many and will eventually get to this one. I purchased these toys when I was overseas so I have a limited idea on how well she like this toy.
4,TY Dora,"I bought the TY BeanieTy Beanie Baby Dora the ExplorerDora & Boots, and Dora's Back Pack. I was pleased with them all, except the back pack had a stronger than usual new smell, however a little freebreez and all was well. More importantly my granddaughter was extremely happy with all of the products."
5,Wow! Early Learning Does Work!,"Dr. Harvey, Dean of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Phialdelphia, wrote this book for people who wonder what happens to kids whose parents teach them to read at a very early age. While this was not a ""scientific"" study, the evidence that these are happy, well-adjusted kids is compelling. They may not all be rocket scientists, but they have a confidence and love of learning that will take them far."
2,Not so tuff,The main part of the ball is great and has mostly survived daily chewing. The rest of this toy is useless. Within a few hours of getting this toy our Border Terrier (read small-med size dog) had removed and eaten most of the land areas (green parts) that appeared to be just glued on. The rope didn't last much longer.
2,Disappointment,"Purchased the Planet Dog Medium Orbee-Tuff Orbee with Rope, Blue/Green on August 21, 2010Rope came out of one side after 4 uses. No way to easily re-insert it. Ended up having to knot the rope in several places to continue using it. Would not recommend it."
4,Goodbye Australia!,"This was my puppy's favorite of a new batch of toys I got to keep her busy. It's good for tug of war, and she loves chewing it on her own. Unfortunately, with persistance she was able to chew off Australia. I saw her do it, so I snapped it up before it got swallowed, but that belies some of the ""tuff"" claims, no? I hope that was a one-time thing, b/c she does love this toy."
3,"Humble beginnings for bizzare band, for better or worse","Jangling eccentric piano and guitar alt rocker that reminisces a more recent White Stripes vibe then this indie darling band's later, more rampantly experimental fare. Getting out their obvious Beatles indulgences, this is no doubt the Furnaces most accessible album, and while most songs are appreciated in their warped catchy quality, few carve out any real identification for themselves, let alone rise above the vantage point of mere musical exercise. When the validation for this band's further importance is justified however, there is the distinct feel of a special brand of old British psychedelia with the modern twist of production edginess, nothing new to the retro craze, except with Gallowsbird's Bark the modern twist does not make these past homage reek of cynical hipster composition, something this band really has strayed farther away from in principal ever since their popularity took off."
5,It includes some very important basics.,"I have some experience in turning wood. I am getting back into it and wanted to freshen up on some safety items. I was having a hard time finding what speed to start turning a piece of wood I had preparted. After reviewing several book on a book store shelf, this book was the only one that actually has a chart for wood sizes and speeds to match. I think this is very, very important. For this reason alone I would give this book a 5 star rating; valuable information that other authors left out."
5,Magnifico!,"It is so great to have this available on DVD. The audio quality is much better than the VHS and the opera itself is fantastic. The sets, cast, costuming and of course the La Scala opera house are wonderful!"
2,"Great Music, Poor Performance","These Hindemith pieces are among my favorites. Unfortuately, Piet Kee plays them so poorly I don't think even Hindemith would recognize them. Where Hindemith likes his music flowing freely, these are plodding and disjoint. Some pauses sound suspiciously like the performer searching for the right keys. If you're looking for the Hindemith sonatas, don't waste your money on this CD. Go get one of the other performances that are now available.The Reger pieces are played well enough, but I wasn't overly fond of them either."
4,The wonder africa's music,"I think these music are wonderful africa music and world music, these make me to release the pressure."
5,Dr. Lee was ahead of his time,Love this book. Lots of easy to understand information. Dr. Lee was in the forefront of many doctors with his ideas. Too bad most doctors just want to hand out pills rather than try to help women. I have purchased other books by Dr. Lee as well and they are all great.
4,what your doctors dont tell you about cancer,"I havent finish reading the book however, what I have read so far is quite interesting and very informative. Mo CT"
4,"UML for software products, maybe lines too?","It's still unclear to me how the software product lines in this book are distinguished simply from the products themselves. There is more emphasis on reuse and this appears to be the key distinguishing characteristic. But even with the book just focusing on a singly product this is a valuable work showing the use of techniques of Object Oriented Analysis and Design using UML. The book is a solid piece of work (both physically and in content), though there is a bias towards illustrations as opposed to explanatory text. Software architects should evaluate the book in person. Front line software engineers probably won't find much they can apply to their work."
4,"Good book, great industry.",This book is very informative and I can attest to most of its accuracy. I have been mystery shopping for National Shopping Service for years and love it. They have some really fun mystery shopping opportunities and the pay is pretty good. This would be a great company to get started with as they are very big and have a ton of clients. You can sign up online on their website at http://www.nationalshoppingservice.com.
4,Detailed and exhaustive but outdated,"As an ASIC design engineer, I liked the concept of this book and the breadth of the material covered. This book is broadly divided into two parts - one on FPGA's/PLD's and one on custom ASIC's (the author refers to all of these as ASIC's). The FPGA section covers programmable cells, i/o cells interconnects and design software for some devices of Xilinx, Altera and Actel. I found these sections informative but a bit boring. As you may expect from a nearly 10 year old book, most of the information is outdated. The ASIC's section consists of chapters on HDL's (you are better off reading a separate book on Verilog/VHDL), synthesis, simulation, test, floorplannng, placement and routing. I found these sections much more useful. The writing style is incoherent in many places and very informal throughout. This book is better suited for a reference to a practising engineer than for a college textbook."
2,Be careful w/ this plant,It was very pretty for about a month and died after we had very bad rain. I had the pot lined w/ rocks and sand it still didn't drain well. I think it might have been okay if I had planted it in the ground. It was cheap enough to take the risk of purchase.
5,Almost got it,"I gave this a 5 star rating based on the fact it is a mixtape and not an album. If it was an album I would have given it 4 stars but that's besides the point. The USDA did their thing on this album and I'm happy Jeezy introduced them to the public on a commercial standpoint. Like all of other Jeezy related material, there is some solid production. If your not familiar with Jeezy or what he's about then the content of this mixtape may be over your head. Besides that, Jeezy drops some very good verses. Slick and Bloodraw need a little more time to develop.Some songs I preferred were:12. I Keep Tellin' Myself, 09. Live My Life, 07. Pam, and 05. Corporate Thuggin'."
5,Bruce Rocks,"This is really great stuff, well presented. My only criticism would be I'd like to see more tracks so its easier to replay the tunes from where you need to, in order to learn them. Fortunately I learn fast by ear, by everyone may not. Not for beginners, but perfect for the mid level player like me."
2,It will make lens dirty,the brush is ok. But I tried the other side on my hand first. As it says on other Lenspen seller's review.It made my hands black. I'm afraid to try it on my lens. Then i wiped the black thing off on a piece of paper.What is that black thing? It's not as good as it says. So i just use the brush for now.
5,the neural reboot is worth 10 times the price.,I am 3 weeks into Tai Cheng and I am already noticing a difference in how I carry myself and pain. This is a great program and can help anyone if they take it seriously! Thanks Doc!
5,"Marvelous! Even for an older, beginner!","I have always loved tai chi. Finding Dr. Cheng's workout that is based on tai chi and incorporates the stretching, breathing, balance, as well as the forms is a wonder!!!!"
3,its OK,Nice glass but priced high.i was using this for almost 6 months it was cook.The glass was so fragile and it broke when i kept in my pocket and bent down.
2,TARNISHED WINDOW.......,"Having enjoyed Ms. Mason's first two releases, this new release after about 5 years is a big dissapointment.....no tracks have the energy and depth of songs such as DARK HORSE, STRONG ONE, ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER......I have listened to this cd a couple of times through since purchasing it and now it is best used a coaster.....hate to say it=( I hope she does better next time."
5,This is the continuing story of Cheaper by the dozen,"I love this story. It has all of the same actors that acted in Cheaper by the Dozen, so its easy to figure out who is who in it. It's a fun movie to watch with your family, very entertaining."
1,Just Doesn't Fly,I have been flying rc helicopters for a while. I puchased one of these helicopters when I was starting out.It is a waist of money. It is not what you need to enjoy flying. IT DOEN'T FLY. The slopy up and down motion is very hard to control because of it's poor design.
1,bought 3 all junk,"I have within the last 6 months bought 3 of these copters,,the first two arrived broken,,dont deal with HobbyTron, they will rip you off. sent one back to them for refund or exchange....never heard from them. Money gone, chalk it up to expierence. second one, also arrived broken, sent it back, they sent me another, which also had the tail rotor broken!this one was from Xhobby, I think. so I got another, it came with a charger that didn't work! sent for a new charger,,charged up the battery, and burned out the PCB box!!! When it did work it didn't have enoughr power to get off the ground......my advise AVOID THIS COPTER!!...go with a ""Big Chinook"" or a ""Mini Chinook"" from Xheli Co. Good Company and those copters have worked the best for me."
3,"Too Much Internalization, Not Enough Action","The story line was ok, but from the description I expected more to happen. The main character did a lot of thinking and not very much acting. Most of the book consists of the main character thinking about her life and how unhappy she is with it. It might just be a personal preference, but I think more should have happened outside of the main character's mind. The writing was decent, though."
4,Not quite as good as..,"I was hoping, but still good. You really can't go wrong with Morricone. However, the price of $30 is high these days (7/2012) for a CD so I was expecting better.My particular complaint is that the main melody is repeated too often and there is not as much variation in mood or tone between the tracks as some of his other albums, especiallyThe Mission: Original Soundtrack From The Motion Picturewhich is so totally awesome."
3,"Has some good content, but low quality pop-ups","I bought this book after having bought ""Encyclopedia Prehistorica"" which I love. The popups in Architechure popup are low quality. The content is pretty good, though. There is some good reading and good history, but if you want that, go buy a history book.If I would have bought this pop-up book first, I probably never would have bought another pop-up. My recommendation: go buy ""Encyclopedia Historica"" by Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart, the most fantastic popup I have ever seen. I got it here at Amazon.com (which I also love!). Sorry about the bad review, but I am just being honest.With absolute sincerity,Jerry"
3,Architecture Pop Up Book by Anton Radevsky,"It is a wonderful book with beautiful three-dimensional graphics, a good format and surprising details."
2,Lacking depth...,"I found this book to be rather scatter-shod and unfocused. Being an experienced user of Cinema 4D I was honestly looking forward to the release of this book. Given its title that suggests the book will cover animating with Cinema 4D in-depth, I was rather shocked to find it covered the integration of 3rd party apps more then it covered Cinema 4D. Leaving out coverage of the Timeline and F-Curves in Cinema 4D, this book barely scrapes the surface of Cinema 4D. In fact, more than anything it seems to suggest that you can't accomplish a whole lot in Cinema 4D without 3rd party apps. Which any experienced Cinema 4D user will tell you is far from the truth. I would suggest skipping this book altogether."
1,With friends like these...,"This book is trash written by a man with no faculty for research and no clear understanding of the subject. First define eccentric people as unconventional types who are healthy, happy and functional (unhappy, nonfunctional types are after all neurotic- not eccentric). Then make the astounding discovery that eccentrics are happier,healthier and more functional than the average. If this sounds like science to you then you might enjoy the book. The author fails to distinguish between eccentrics who don't care about conformity , and those unfortunates who are grossly deluded or constitutionally incapable of conformity. The author fails to recognise cold-blooded social sarcasm as oppposed to eccentricity. As an experienced eccentric I found the book poorly thought out, self contradictory, and somewhat patronizing."
4,Eccentrics: Start Your Engines,"This book was great. It was lively, entertaining, spoke of past and present eccentrics and as somebody who cottons to the term ""eccentric,"" this book delivered most of what I hoped it would.The few objections I had to the book were the random clinical records tossed about in an attempt to distinguish if the persons in question were truly ""eccentric"" or ""mentally ill."" Here, I believe the author made a crucial mistake in that he blurred the line between eccentricity and mental illness, thus leaving the reader to wonder -""what's the difference?"" or ""Does eccentricity really exist?"" This was mostly due, in part, to the clinical studie's failing to report significant differences between what groups the author deemed as ""eccentric"" vs. those who were ""mentally ill.""All in all, though, I enjoyed this book and learned some things about some interesting people and that's why I purchased the book in the first place."
5,Gollum and his rock base,"This Gollum is very bendy and his rock's precious phrase is like the sound in the movie. His head is screwed very grumpy. Now the durability is 4 stars, his shorts are already torn up so that is why I gave the durability 4 stars."
4,It's adorable and addictive,"Ok, I didn't want to like Chobits. I sneered at it from afar. Then I watched it, and now I'm hooked. #@&$@!Chobits tries to be a lot of things at once... a love story, a drama, a fanservice comedy. What is amazing it that it manages to stay so interesting. About the only negative thing I can say here is that Chobits deals frequently with sexual subject matter. But if you have access to cable TV then you and your kids have already seen enough to make this lightweight as far as adult subject matter.@#$@! I just can't find much to criticize.I give up. I admit it. I like Chobits. A lot. I want Chobits merchandise, and I want more Chobits DVDs to come out. Syrup never tasted sooo gooood."
2,There are better sleeves,"I bought this sleeve to put my macbook in a backpack. It is padded enough, and the outside is a nice fabric. One of the tabs on the zipper broke after 2 months. The included keyboard cover is a flimsy waste of money. Buy a keyboard cover from Radtech instead. I'd look at other sleeves with a little more padding and a zipper that has no danger of scratching the laptop."
2,Wrong Spec for this drive,"This drive is an 8x/4x/32x drive. The first number is the CD-R speed, the second is the CD-RW speed, and the last is the CD-ROM speed.This is important, because top end drives are now 32x for CD-R.I almost made this mistake, and bought this drive. I found out just in time."
4,Cool gear,This is a really cool piece gear but for me it didn't work out. Everything was great about it but I have really muscular legs and it just didn't fit. So if you are a person with big or muscular legs you might want to think about something else. Take note that there are many different applications for it but I wanted it just for my leg and it didn't work out but if you need it for something else it might work for you
4,Great soundtrack,"Amazing soundtrack. Fabulous jazz numbers by Goldsmith. One of his best. This CD, however, does seem a bit repetitive."
4,The mind is powerful,"Invisible ChildThis is an amazing story going into the mind and heart and soul of a family dealing with powerful emotions that are definitely real to them. A lot of times we forget we can not feel what they feel but need to appreciate them and go where they are at, until they can work through the personal side. Just because you can not see something does not mean it is not real, if only in the mind!"
4,A good introduction to a central area of philosophy,"This book was the first introduction I had to the area of metaphysics. The first chapter does a good job of explaining just what metaphysics is about. It is unfortunate that most people associate the word 'metaphysics' with crystal religions and astrology because that is NOT what metaphysics means in philosophy. If one is interested in finding out what ""true"" metaphysics is, this book is accessible to almost anyone. The later chapters get complicated but if the reader takes some time, the material can be understood. One thing to note is that Carter's own views dominate the book and, as with anything, one should not just read this book. Readers might be interested in Peter van Inwagen's *Metaphysics* after reading this book. Also, if *Elements of Metaphysics* does get too thick, the reader may wish to read Thomas Nagel's *What Does It All Mean?* before continuing to work through Carter's book."
2,GOOD FOR ROUGH CARPENTRY,"I AM A FINE CARPENTER SPECIALIZING IN HIGH END KITCHEN CABINET INSTALLATIONS. I DEAL WITH ALL PRE FINISHED WOODS AND CROWN, IN OTHER WORDS....NO PUDDY!! I LOVE THE SAW AS AN IDEA FOR THE IDEAL. HOWEVER, AFTER RETURNING TWO SAWS BECAUSE THE SPINDLE HAD A WABBLE IN IT MAKING MY CUTS LOOK LIKE A PIRAHNA ATTACKED MY BOARD, I FOUND ONE WITHOUT THIS PROBLEM. IVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW (JUST TRYING TO GET MY $700 WORTH OUT OF IT) NOW IM CONVINCED THAT THE CASTING OF THE BASE IS WARPED. WHEN IT READS SQUARE AT A 90 AND THEN YOU GO TO 45 IN ITHER DIRECCTION, THE BLADE IS NO LONGER PERPENDICULAR WITH THE BASE. IVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS TO ONLY FAIL. THIS IS A GREAT SAW IF YOU ARE A FRAMER. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PROFESSIONAL FINISH CARPENTERS, THIS SAW NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD."
3,Good but far from a classic...,"I love Adalberto, but this is not his finest hour (although the cover is a classic). Check him out first w. Barreto and then come back to this set."
3,blade is ok,"I bought this for a replacement wiper on my 2007 Dodge Caliber. Considering it is made by Bosch, I expected superior quality. This blade seemed to work pretty good for maybe the first month. After that, I can say it held up as well as cheaper blades from walmart. I was not very impressed with this product and honestly, would not spend the money on it again."
1,Paul B VT,"Bosch 424A ICON Wiper Blade - 24""Blade was good for 20 days. Then first frost the bracket at the center snapped within 30 days. Amazon replaced no problem. However because of the size 24"" this is not the blade for all seasons. I have shorter version of this on other cars no problem but I have since switched to a Bosch Winter Blade for Vermont usage."
1,Fuhget about it,"This album sucks. It's mostly unoriginal and he does a lot of remakes. The only possible, slightly, minumly good song is the remake of New Edition's Can You Stand The Rain. Other than that, his weak, girly voice ruins any chance of this Cd being any more than 1 star."
2,OVERRATED! IT'S JUST AN OK ALBUM,"I Voted for him during the Australian Idol! But this album disappointed me and now I really think Paulini should have crowned the Australian Idol. I think he done better on the competition than this album. It's just an ok album but not a bad album. Basically it is still acceptable. I rated this album a 2 stars material because some of the songs really got me bore. Hope the next album would be a better album.Frankly speaking, I think the other Australian Idol Season 1's finalist whose named Rob Mills(a.k.a known as Millsy or Millswah) has a better album ""Up All Night"" produced compare to this one. Also keep an eye out for Paulini Curuenavuli's album ""One Determind Heart"" and Cosima De Vito's forthcoming album(currently the album is on working in US with music producer Diane Warren), they will be an even better albums for sure. Check them out guys ;>"
4,Go the Fro!,"This guy (!) is superstar material. He comes across as a sincere, funny and extremely talented young man in interviews and during his performances (yes, I got majorly hooked on the Idol thing after hearing him sing!) that you just want to see him succeed because you know he'll wear success well. I hope he focuses on writing, producing and performing more of his own songs - that will be his ticket to credibility and longevity in the industry, I think.This album is a great buy in spite of a couple of remakes, which he pulls off well anyway - it's just that the original stuff's heaps better! His voice is awesome and I can't wait for his next album (which I hear is going to be gospel/R&B based) to come out. Although I rate this album 4 stars, Guy Sebastian is definitely a 6 stars musician! Look out for him in the future and have a taste of him now by buying copies of this album for you and your friends!!"
1,Not for everyone,"Though they receive glowing reviews across the web, these just don't work for me at all. The front dot is so huge is completely obscures the target, and I can't even see the rear line in order to ""make a lollipop"". It may be my eyesight, but I just can't see the rear line reliably at my local range, and my accuracy is horrible with these sights.Your mileage may vary, but for me this was an expensive experiment that just didn't work out."
1,Wrong song samples,"I gave this album 1 star not because it's bad. The one star goes to Amazon....They don't have the right set of song on the sample links. I don't think songs on this album are circa 1930's sax, slow and light."
3,Future Kings of the Ring!,"If anything, get these movies for the pure historical significance. The wrestlers that would become Sonjay Dutt, M Dogg 20, and Josh Prohibition are all in this video."
5,Brand New,So glad to find this since the movie is 20 years old. I love the score and think Danny Elfman is wonderfully talented. Items like this I am very thankful for Amazon.
5,I used to listen to this with my kids,Although my kids are gone this great score constantly reminds me of the happy times.
5,Danny has done it again!,"Well, here we have one of those ""I wan't to cry by your side"" score that's going to be your favorite with just a couple of the samples displayed. After you see the movie..you feel that rush that tells you..""I want it...Now!"" Trully one of the most beautifull creations from the ""darkman"" himself. If you loved the movie, you will love the soundtrack. No doubts about it. Enjoy!"
3,iLive Boombox,"Sound quality is o.k., not great. No plastic spacers included for new Nano's. Shipping and packaging was good. Not impressed but decent ipod player for the money."
3,FISHING FOR DUMMIES,Disappointed. Book damaged in shipping. NO COLOR SECTION like the exact same edition in the local library. Book would have been a SOLID 5 STARS if and only if received undamaged and a COLOR section like it should have contained.
3,good but too expensive,"howdy y'all,this is GOOD stuff! it's a tad too hot for me, so i either buy the ""milder"" version or add some non-spicy canned tomatoes to it.the price is ... outrageous, tho. at about twenty-nine dollars for a 12-pack, it comes to nearly two fifty for ONE CAN. since it's listed at ro-tel for a suggested price of one thirty - and available at most grocery stores for one dollar - that's far, far too much.hopefully, the price will eventually drop. then i'll buy LOTS of it! [*grin*]take care,lee"
2,Not as good as the last one,"This book is a bit of a let down. The main problem I have with it is that there are pages and pages of absolutely nothing happening. This book could have been shortened by about 80 pages. Mary Crow is an interesting character, but really doesn't do anything until the last 40 pages of the book. Her relationship with Jonathan is nothing more than an afterthought. The most interesting characters in the story are the two little girls who figure out what's going on before anyone else does, and they began to annoy me after awhile. Had high hopes for this one, but it just didn't cut it."
3,Legacy of Masks,"Ok, but I read the book because I live in Tn. and grew up in NC. and knew all the areas that were talk about."
1,Argg...Boring,"I got this book based on a recommendation from a user on this site and boy, that was a big mistake! Basically, this is just a bunch of stories, each about a member of JLA who is facing a personal problem mostly involving the weight of the world on his or her shoulders and not being able to save everyone and grieving the people they were not able to save. The stories don't really link together, although some stories get revisited at the end. Artwork is on low-quality non-glossy paper and the colors look washed-out. The drawings are less than average. The whole book is really short and while I'm not suggesting it should be longer due to the boring subject matter, I am suggesting to not buy the book at all because it's just a waste of time and a pretty uninteresting read. By far, the weakest book in my collection."
5,Much Better Than a Meat Pancake Thingy!!!,"I love this book, and the Get Fuzzy comic in general. But I have to agree, its just not as funny and satisfying as the other ones. It could have been a bit funnier, and the book did have its really hilarious moments (Bucky getting a shirt for Satchel that shows a picture of a certain type of drug plant and the shirt beneathe it says ""Legalize it"") and it still remains interesting. I can't wait for the next books."
4,"Nice on the outside, not so much on the inside","The passport case is very nice, the texture, the color, the fabric, the genuine leather.The only complain is that is only sewed with one thread on the edges, I'm not sure how long this is gonna last. Also the inside is folded and pasted with glue apparently, so I'm not sure how much this is gonna last too.The price is really low but you have to add the shipping, for a total of ~$8I guess is the best option for a low budget."
2,Tips Too Easily,"Got a very similar model at a Babies R Us several months ago, but without the adult's handle. My son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself, and we generally like the style, but the trike tips so easily that I rarely take it out for him to use. Never would have thought to check this but I'll be in the market for a big-wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model."
1,*** LOOK ELSEWHERE ***,"I wasted my money on this book, but I didn't waste my time -- at about page 40, I started to skim thru the rest of it.The book contains the usual caveats and recommendations concerning money management, except for a ""Rule of 10,"" whichreally did not fit in. Basic explananations included are chart patterns, support and resistance, and candlestick reversals.Then, fully 94 pages are devoted to a self-indulgent log of 6 weeks of trading by the author, listing subjective interpretations of events in making trading decisions. How we are to become ""masters of futures trading"" by reliving this undisciplined hodgepodge, I do not know.If you have not already done so, investigate the books of Perry Kaufman, Alexander Elder and Jacob Bernstein, and get your time and your money's worth."
5,Good Quality - inexpensive,I looked at straps locally and they were much more expensive then the Voguestrap. This is just what I wanted and works well.
2,"Ordered in January, broken in October.","This watchband has at least a couple of shortcomings for my application. The first is that it is shorter than the band that was originally on my Timex Expedition. It was long enough, but just barely.I agree with an earlier reviewer that the leather is very stiff. The second is that the quality of the leather is so poor that any kind of abrasion results in the smooth surface being removed. My watchband looks like a cat chewed on it.Finally the fixed loop that secures the band broke a couple of days ago.I will be buying a Timex replacement for this watch. My recommendation is that you avoid this watchband."
4,Good Watch Bands,These a good watch bands. If you have large wrist do not order regular length bands. Good quality leather and hasp. I paid twice the price foe my last band and it was not as good as these.
2,Powerboat basics,"As an experienced sailor switching over to powerboats I have been reading both magazines and "" How to Choose,"" books on powerboating.I figure with such a large purchase you can never be to well read.I found Gould's book to be too basic for someone with boating experience.The chapters are brief and often read like a text book.I also purchased Lamy's boat buying book and found it to be more detailed and loaded with interesting anecdotes. Gould's book does get into more details on boat accessories such as anchors, air-conditioning, refrigeration,and electronics and these topics are not well covered by Lamy.Lamy gives tremendous detail on the purchase process, but only briefly covers accesories and primary systems. I recommend this book as a quick read to inexperienced boat buyers,but recommend that experienced boaters also read a few other books to suppliment ""How to Choose Your First Powerboat."""
4,How to Choose your...,Includes very useful information including basic information about boat and trailer handling. A book to consider if you don't know anything about boats and are considering purchasing one.
5,For skeptics...,"This Ayurvedic compound of many herbs, some with proven efficacy, is remarkably effective. I have seen its benefits in two ""high-strung"" stressed people, for whom it produced a calming effect without a sense of being sedated."
4,This is not George Bailey's Wonderful Life.,Pottersville is a well-written story about the struggles of a young man trying to find his place in Chicago. His failed relationships and not-so-subtle dislike for his corporate job is hilarious and somewhat familiar. We've all have terrible dating and stories and Alfonso brings his to life with such vivid clarity and detail that you feel as if you are going through the same experience. Pottersville is fun story for anybody looking for a book that is both entertaining and thought provoking. A fun twist at the end that I wasn't even expecting.
1,Poor book masquerading as fact,"As a listener to Limbaugh's radio show, I decided to read this book to see if Limbaugh was indeed wrong about many things. This book, while proporting to show errors in Limbaugh's words, has failed miserably. Most things that are cited are taken out of context, misunderstood sarcasm, or just not true period. This book's authors had better understand that to be taken seriously they should do a better job of digging up ""errors"" not just throw bits of sarcasm or things taken out of context out for public consumption. However, one does understand that the few examples they DID dig up would never fill up a book."
1,Only 100 statements?,"You expect us to think that Rush has had a reign of error by telling us only 100 statements that may have been false? Rush says at least 1,000 statements everyday over the radio."
2,Thought provoking,"While the premise ofthe book is good, there are several contextual errors. Many of the quotes taken at face value as being serious are simply sarcastic or designed to illustrate current events in a humorous light."
1,Dont waste you money or time.,Most of this can be found on the internet for free and this book just reguritates for the sake of a book.I have to disagree with most of it anyway but I suppose it will be loved by the negheads of this world
1,Another failure in MLM writes a book,Isn't it getting a little old that another person is writing a book about the Amway model ruining their life? Amway and now Quixtar created the most self made multi millionaires in the history of this country and has created wealth for any person that wants it. I bet if Patrick spent as much time building his business instead of being a critic he would have the life only imagined. No one has ever done anything great by wetting on themselves anytime the going got tough.
5,This book has everything you need!,"If you are writing your own vows, or trying to come up with a toast, or need a reading for the ceremony...or just feel like telling your significant other how much you love him/her, this book is for you: tons and tons of sample vows, everything from poetry excerpts to ""cookie cutter"" vows where all you have to do is fill in the blank with the right name. It has vows for every occasion, quotes and sayings about love and marriage, and a whole lot more. This book is a great buy and should be passed on to friends!"
4,Help with Wedding,"This pocket sized Book has a lot of ideas for couples who want to write their own vows. Some are a little outrageous, but it definitely has some great traditional and nontraditional hints and helps."
1,MYShuffle,I haven't used the car charger yet but so far the wall charger isn't performing. I put my shuffle on the wall charger and 8 hours later it still wasn't charged up.
1,reading was a waste of time,"This books talks much about substantial things on building web-sites. It gives an overview of html, cgi and ms access, tells basic rules how to make web-sites with database, how to organize that and so on BUT it really doesn't tell the most important thing: How exactly to create a perl program that can query an access database! I simply wanted to build a small database and query it with perl, I couldn't reach that target with this book. So it was a waste of time."
2,Look elsewhere for books on this subject,I found this book very disappointing since there seem to be so few books geared toward designing web databases specifically with Access 97. 80% of the book's material covers everything but Acess database design. The CD is nothing but a collection of outdated shareware from various vendors.
5,Getting Back to Good Music,"It's good to hear good music that doesn't have foul and explicit sexual language. Regis gets better as he ages, like fine wine. Congratulations Hollywood Records for noticing good talent."
2,When your singing...the whole world wants to sing over you !,"WARNING: This is not a pleasant ""musical"" experience !You know as a recording act that you are in serious trouble when WILLIAM SHATNER has released a cd considered by critics to be far superior to your recording. Yes, there have been no lifelines used here ! This is a musical mess. A weak attempt from a desperate recording label to make a fast buck from the celebrity status of the performer. Another bad case of cashing in on celebrity minus any musical artistry.Mr. MILLIONAIRE do us all a favor and STICK to your daytime job ! At the end of 2004, this recording figured on top of most music critics listings as the ""worst recording of 2004""."
2,Crooning...a dead art,In my title I say that crooning is a dead art. Its something that a former generation of musicians and singers have carefully crafted and developed for those who are less musically gifted than others. I consider crooning to be more like melodic talking rather than singing. It is a dead art that should stay dead...rather its being ressurected by an egomaniac. If you'd like to hear an old man croon over outdated melodies (though some may argue these songs are timeless) then by all means stroke little Regis' ego by buying the record. But if you want real singing....then maybe you should pass on this one!!!!P. S. I would have given him one star but I gave him an extra one just because I like Kelly Ripa so much
1,Great initially but DEAD one month after the 1 year warranty expired,"This WAS my favorite little device. It's slow, as it's a hard drive and not a flash drive. But, for the capacity and price it was unbeatable. That is, until it suddenly locked up and cannot be revived, literally weeks after the meager 1-year warranty expired. A 2 GB Kingston memory stick has a 5 year warranty. I can see why this device has such a short warranty--it's completely unreliable long-term. Check out the other reviews-same problem. 6 months ago I would have given it 5 stars, but the obvious unreliability of the device makes it worthless in the long-term. Too bad Seagate can't raise their manufacturing quality."
2,Size Matters,"The drive claims to be 6gb but is actually 5.57GB . It's a dirty tactic by a lot of hard drive manufacturers. when buying a mobile drive space is very precious so get something Flash based, it will also be more durable. I had a lot of good experience with the cruzer micro drives."
1,Piece of Crud,"I saw this on Cartoon Network a couple of times. Everytime I have seen it, I hated it. Bad animation, annoying characters, unfunny jokes, and Tommy's a jerk. Avoid at all costs."
4,Very Surprised!,"I have the films, Bernadette starring Sydney Penny and Je m'appelle Bernadette starring Katia Miran. I bought this DVD to add to my Bernadette collection. I did not expect too much as it was made in 1960 and was in black and white. After viewing the film I am quite surprised, I really enjoyed it. It's very difficult to have an actor play Bernadette as she was only 4'7"" tall, although Danielle Ajoret did not resemble Bernadette she played a very good part in my opinion, especially the scenes in the Convent @ Nevers. The black and white setting suited me just fine as it seemed to depict the aura of the times. The film itself was surprisingly very historically accurate, more so than the 1943 Song of Bernadette which was ""Hollywood"" made. I recommend this movie for people who want to know more about Bernadette; her life, her struggles, and her piety."
3,Inspiring,"This was inspiring film - black and white version.I did enjoy watching it.Although, I thought it was the coloured version onthat is always shown on TV at Easter time."
5,A résumé of more than 10 years of research.,"For newcomers in the field, this is probably the best book available."
2,no instructions or Torx tool,I anticipate that this battery will be fine once I get it installed. My problem is that after reading the 2 previously posted reviews on Amazon for this item that I had the impression the Torx T5 driver would be included. I just received the battery and I received it in a timely manner. I can't install it though because I don't have the Torx tool to remove the back of my Zire 72.The product description does not include mention of including the T5 tool so it is not falsely advertised; just don't misunderstand what you will be receiving by reading the reviews posted for this item. You will just receive the battery (and you DO need a Torx T5 tool to change out the battery on the Zire 72).
2,Importing,A great resource for first time and experienced importers who do not fully understand their responsibilites as an importer.
3,"That feel, bro...","The package arrived way before the estimated arrival date and was still in the case as described. However, while Ultra Magnus was perfectly fine, Skywarp was defective (the wing was already broken off in the box). Now, I attempted to remedy this, but the peg that holds the right wing in was far too big (or vice-versa), so there was no way it was going in. I guess it'll be a bit longer before I complete my seekers..."
4,Hard to put down,"This book is a page-turner,even if it is a little hard to believe. I had a hard time putting it down, but was wanting a little more out of it. The middle of the book had alot of unimportant info in it and the end was too short and left alot of unanswered questions. I would like to see her write more of this kind of book."
2,A good sub-plot cannot save this book.,"This book probably has the worse Superman/Doomsday battle ever fought. Although the beginning was strong, this book does not live up to Superman standards. The only good thing about this book was the interesting story about a blizzard that hit the Kent farm when Clark was just barely beginning to develope his powers. Only get this book if you are either a Superman collector, or if you enjoy looking at pretty pictures."
1,Couldn't even install it due to missing disk.,"This was what has become typical of large software companies. The installation kit was one disk but after a long time of seeming to be installing, it asked for another disk that wasn't in the package. I suppose I was expected to hunt it down on the web and download it, burn it and then continue, but for that price it can go look for it itself. Adobe has fallen a long, long way. I ended up returning it for a refund."
4,Makes some REALLY Good points.,"This book does not provide anything really new on the subject of relationships, but it is a handy quick reference for getting into doors and drawers."
2,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"tHE GLASSES JUST SNAPPED WHEN i TOOK IT OFF... zTOO DELICATE FOR ITS PURPOSE!!! sAVE YOUR MONEY!I AM STILL DUMFOUNDED IN HOW IT BROKE, EVEN NOW! SO TAKE MY STUPID ADVICE AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,"it's great, but...","One thing about this dvd bothers me, but apparently no one else seems to mind, so it must be a matter of taste. I ALMOST feel like I am there, yes. Unfortunately, the viewing angle changes every 7 to 10 seconds because whoever did the final video mix had too much caffeine and could not leave things alone for a single camera angle for more than this small amount of time. For me, it detracts markedly from what otherwise is a great dvd concert."
4,wine cooler,"The product does work to cool wine and keep it cool. In simple fact, it is just an ice bag you keep in the freezer till you need it! The outside make it nicer for company to see. I would probably buy again knowing what I do now."
4,works as expected,"it works well, the stainless steel makes it a nice looking piece even though it's a bit bulky when you pour. I gues you can't have everything. overall I am happy with it"
5,Works like a charm....Brrrr,"This product works great and keeps my whites colder than ever. It also looks good and is incredibly easy to use. I might get an extra sleeve for entertaining, but that's about it."
2,not much for the money,"thought I had run into the ultimate collection of the small faces recordings, there were four tracks all from the beat club, well done, but that was it, all the rest was advertising other dvd compilations that were made, and they were not complete songs to enjoy either. The title should have hinted more at the true meaning of the dvd's release"
5,A BETTER COLLECTION !!!!!,"ANY NEW GENERATION FANS , THIS IS THE COLLECTION FOR YOU-IT FEATURES A LOT OF THEIR BEST WORK,INCLUDED ARE CLASSICS FEATURING BOBBY BROWN AND JOHNNY GILL-ALL THE EARLY HITS-""COOL IT NOW"" ""MR.TELEPHONE MAN"" ""A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE (IS ALL IT TAKES) AN AWESOME MID-TEMPO GROOVE!

JIMMYJAM, TERRY LEWIS PRODUCED THE NOW CLASSICS ""IF IT ISN'T LOVE"" AND ""CAN YOU STAND THE RAIN?"" AND THE RARE GEM ""HELPLESSLY IN LOVE"". THERE IS ANOTHER GEM FROM THE MOTION PICTURE ""RUNNING SCARED"" ""ONCE IN A LIFETIME GROOVE"". THIS CD ALSO FEATURES THE JAMS ""HIT ME OFF"" AND ""I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU"" THIS IS A TRUE COLLECTOR'S ITEM-ORDER YOURS TODAY !"
4,takes me back,I'm a Boston girl who has always loved New Edition. I sing along loudly whenever I listen to this CD.
4,great!,Most of all I liked track 1 and 4. Waiting to hear your next. Keep going. Thank`s alot for your CD.
4,"Better then itrip, but same sound quility.","I had the i-trip until it broke recently. I needed to replace it, but wanted to see if there was something better. I had the same problem that other people had with the i-trip. It changed stations on me when I was using shuffle, sometimes I couldn't get it to change back, it was hard to change stations while driving and sound quility was just OK. All these problems accept the sound quility, were fixed with the airplay. You can not expect to great of sound without a direct connection. I did notice if you turn you sound louder up on the i-pod there is less interferance. Anyway great product for it's price and for it's use, but don't expcet perfect sound. Buy this over over the I-trip."
2,Everything old is new again(so he tried),"A good band at one time but now seems to be lacking something such as punch as well as some more modern creativity. This would be a better album if it was their first, but older material is actually more appealing. Seems like they may be getting rockstar syndrome. Such as they forgot to listen to their closest criticism. Good band but, last album all sounds the same."
5,a small masterpiece,"Dan Pope has created a small masterpiece here, a world where readers catch an unexpected glimpse of themselves at every turn."
4,A nice leisure read,"I ordered the book due to several favorable reviews on it and was glad I did. The book is from the point of view of a twelve year old boy but is full of adult situations. Without giving too much away or reiteratiing the blurb,the boy observes a lot going on with the people around him. The author does a great job of fleshing out the distinct characters and their oddities. I also found the book a bit funny at times. I look forward to reading more from the author."
4,"with a few tweaks, book would be great..","this rhyming story is simple and cute, which i found allows my infant to at least feign interest a little longer than most books (which i understand i may be starting a bit early). i only wish that someone would have thought to make it a board book so that interested kids could man handle the book all they liked without tearing it to pieces."
1,Worse than Useless,"Acrobat 5 is a great product, but Adobe has done a lousy job of communicating its many valuable features and how to use it. Totally unstructured and unintelligible, this book is an example of what happens when computer programmers attempt to communicate in English.I recently participated in an Acrobat focus group made up of people who use the product in their daily work. Everyone agreed that it's very useful in a wide range of applications, but they all had real difficulties learning how to use it. This book only adds to the problem."
1,Inappropriate for 5/6-year-olds,"This little boy and his sister fight a lot throughout the story. They call each other names, and it glorifies a lot of bad behavior. The concept is fine, but the language is inappropriate for 5-year-olds unless you want to encourage fighting in your home. I read this aloud to my nearly-six boy and had to clean up the language and storyline. Older kids may be able to read this and discern between right/wrong behaviors, but the story is written about the age group that is just losing teeth...K-1st graders, and they mimic behavior they read about/watch on TV."
5,Yoga Mat,"Wow, a very sticky 'sticky mat'. It smells of chemicals when you first get it but then again it's made of some 'god-only-knows-what' rubber stuff.It arrived in good shape and on time and I'm very pleased with it."
5,Great Approach,The approach taken by Saxon is hard to beat. It is a great text for new learners and also a great review text for those of us with rusty math skills. The concept of reviewing what you have learned in each lesson without being bogged down with too many problems relating to the new materials is excellent.
2,Lacks of good examples,This book really disappointed me. It does not provide in-depth explanation s on concepts nor good examples.
5,Love it,Love this little memory card reader....so small (about as long as your index finger) yet loaded with benefits.My favorite use is to keep in my camera case so I can view my photos at any given time without the worry of my camera cable to connect me....it also allows me to share quickly with others.
1,Poor Product & Service,I ordered this product and was sent the Zeikos card reader in black instead. I ordered two and the company taped them together with packaging tape. I now have two very sticky card readers to throw in the trash. I would not order anything from this company.
1,Piece of crap,This thing worked once and then didn't work any more. Very cheap didn't like it so I threw it away.
1,No SDHC feature as advertised,This reader is advertised as a 10-in-1 with the ability to read SDHC. This is the main feature I needed with it and it is the one feature it does not have. Zoom into the image here on Amazon and you can plainly see that SDHC is not written on the item. I should have done this when purchasing instead of trusting the seller's words.
3,good deal for a few $s,"I only use it to read SD cards on my MacBook, and it works well enough. I noticed two minor issues. When plugged in, it blocks the adjacent USB port. Also, when I drag to eject it, it always says that it did not eject properly. I remove it anyway, and I have not had any problems as a result. For the price, I would buy it again."
2,Replays of old sogs?,"Oakenfold has lost his sense of originality. Two of the good songs on here were released on Tiesto's Nyana 5 months before okay's release. The song Hypnotized was on bunka already. Give us something new. The song by Leama was on Perfecto's ""collection"". He adds some new songs which aren't that bad but overall I'd give it a 2."
2,not the best and not the worst,"He always manages to stay in the middle and with the flow, nothing original or ground breaking yet he stays aloft - thats how one could describe his dj career and this album is another example of it, times are changing so is music people experiment, start to write ambisious music: like Sasha, Digweed or Nick Warren and he plays what the masses want to hear, always."
5,Oakey finally gets it right,"As a long time lover of trance, I've never really liked Oakey- The first album i ever heard was 'Voyage into Trance', and i found the minimalist, drab goa/drug induced anthems to be just that. However, ""Great Wall"" finally makes me officially love Oakey, combining his amazing mixing and production skills with the mainstream and cross-genre work that he wanted to explore, but, to any trance addict, massively failed to do with Bunkka. It is beautifully mixed, and the track selection is rather good for the most part, the downside being Madonnas track, which is way to mainstream for ANY trance album. (I was lucky enough to be spared the Timberlake track on the American version).If you are a fan of Oakeys earlier stuff, like Voyage or Flouro, you probably wont think this album is anything special.However, if youre a fan of works like Paul Van Dyk's Politics of Dancing or Tiesto's Magik series, you will love this album!"
2,Sorry Paul,"I have always been a huge fan of Oakey, but this album just shows why he is not spinning trance anymore, as his creative energies have been redirected towards more ""pop culture"" projects...for those who are looking for the magic we found in his ""Essential Mixes"" from Ibiza or Sydney, or the smooth proggy-housish/trance sound from Global Underground: New York Disc 1, or for a mix comparable to Tranceport in terms of stellar, classic trance track selection, LOOK ELSEWHERE....if this is his current representation of his style, then Oakey has fallen off.....big time...this CD is for newbies...."
1,Oakey,Could music suck so bad? I would give it a 0 but then I couldnt write the review.... This music is all that is wrong with electronic music...
4,Vintage Jam!!!,"I looked forward to this live release and I picked this one because I liked the setlist and I was eager to hear how Jim sounded amidst the happenings in his personal life at that time. I was pleasantly surprised by the mood of this album. When the announcer was trying to get everybody in their seats in the beginning of Side One, I thought ""What exactly did I buy here?"" I actually found that comical. ""Our hair is just as long as yours man!"" Classic! When the Doors came on though, it was all business and the tracks sound great. The standouts include ""Roadhouse"", ""Mystery Train"", ""When The Music's Over, ""Wake Up"" into ""Light My Fire"" and on side two: ""Carol"" into ""Soul Kitchen"". If you're a new Doors fan, dig this album because it gives you a feel of a good live Doors jam. The musicianship of the band is right on and you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended!"
3,Solid Show,"I am a live music fan. Naturally, I am pleased to see the Doors finally releasing live performances. The releases chosen so far are of an era were I believe the Doors were either trying to heal or to keep Morrison interested. I believe their peak was before the Miami incident. I'd like to see earlier stuff realeased.This is a solid show but nothing spectacular. If you are a Doors fan you should get it. If you just want to listen to their classics in the most familiar renditions, you probably are not a live music fan anyway and this isn't for you."
1,DREADFULLY BORING,Don't believe the previous person who gave it 5 stars as he has a habit of raving over terrible movies. This is the most boring gay film since UNFAITHFULL which was also recently released. The hand held camera is most annoying and even worse is that the cinematography is woeful and dark in several places. Very amateurish.Dont expect to be turned on by the sex scenes - they are very repetative and boring - a naked backside and almost no frontal nudity.Once was enough but not repeated so many times to make the film longer. The extras are just as bad as the main film and no different despite the producer claiming them to be uncut (uncut does not mean that they are raunchier than the main film just more tedious).An elderly female cast member seen near the finale (and talking to an old man) has the most irritating voice to listen to that I have ever heard - flat monotonous voice.Truly dreadful as is the movie.
5,Great gummy bears!,"These gummy bears tasted amazing, and were worth the money. The 6 pound bag is really big -- you'll have plenty to share (or keep to yourself to eat over a period of a month or two!). If you like gummy bears, you will love this product."
5,Delicious!,I love this chocolate. It's really such a wonderful flavor mix. Don't order this if you want a creamy typical chocolate like the basic Toblerone (which is also delicious) but it's a yummy bar to keep on hand when you want to grab a triangle or two of something tasty.
4,Not as fabulous but still a lot of fun...,"Though it is delightful to have Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley back in our homes for another go-round of boozing, bitching and brawling with Saffron, the magic that was the first 3 seasons of ABFAB is not here.I would have to second Thomas Pease's observation that perhaps these episodes would've been better left in the can or on the shelf. It's not that amusing moments go missing, but that the sharp wit and punchy satire on everything ""now"" in modern society (fashion, sex, and shopping, and oh yes, the Internet) have been played before in the first seasons, and with greater pleasure by Saunders and Lumley. It's almost that the party has been over for days, and someone forgot to wake the girls from their latest hangover.All the same they're having more fun here in these six vignettes than most American sitcoms have in entire seasons, if the current domestic TV climate is any indication..."
5,Great product with a reflux baby!!!!,"We bought this mirror when our daughter was only 4 weeks old. She has reflux and constantly starts choking for no apparent reason. It is so wonderful to have the peace of mind to see if she is okay. Although people say backseat mirrors are hazardous, not seeing a choking baby to save them in time is even more dangerous!"
1,"Crappy, crappy, crappy","I really liked this mirror because of the viewing size. However, it does have a VERY BIG FLAW. The mirror comes with a protective film to keep the plastic mirror from being scratched or damaged during shipping, installation, etc. After removing the protective plastic, I accidentally touched the mirror with my thumb. I went to GENTLY rub my thumbprint off with my t-shirt (a soft cloth) and the crappy plastic scratched instantly. Now there's a cloudy area right where I need to see my baby's face. What's the point of having a mirror if I can't see my baby? I have another plastic mirror from a different manufacturer that did not scratch when I wiped off my fingerprints - that's going back into my car. This one is going back to the store. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MIRROR TO ANYONE!"
1,Not worth it!,"This would be a GREAT product -- if I could see my daughter in it! As mentioned before, the mirror has developed this ""coating"" that looks like it has fogged up. I went out there with some Windex thinking that was the problem and it does not wipe off. This was the WORST 12.99 I have ever spent!"
1,Having a hard time,"We've been struggeling with this mirror since we bought it. I really want it to work because it's the only one I found that has fabric like a nice car interior. We have an Xterra, and the car seat is on the side. I tried each of the three ways they suggest attaching it and nothing has worked so far. I think with some home made adjustments we might be able to get it a little better, but maybe not. Oh well!"
2,Not that impressed.,"I bought this mirror because it was cheaper, and I just wanted something for my baby to look at other than a seat when she was in the car. I never could install it in the car correctly, and shortly after I got it, it fogged up. I bought a different brand with a remote that I like a lot more, and so does she. I don't really think that she cares about the fog, so now I use it inside for her to look at and play with. I you want a mirror for your baby in the car, I'd spend the few extra bucks, and get one a little more entertaining."
3,I like the size of it.,"I know it's not that safe to have this in your vehicle, but I have to see my baby. Anyway, I have been using this mirror for a little over three months now (since her birth) and I really can't complain about the mirror fogging up. I better cross my fingers. And I love the size of it. I can see her clearly. I did not know they had this mirror when I had my 2 older boys because I used a tiny little mirrors for them. Had I known about this, I would have gotten this instead--it would have prevented me from squinting just to see them. :)I am giving it 3 stars because I really couldn't use the tether because my baby girl sits in the middle row of the van. I have the new Toyota Sienna and I have the captain chairs, so the strap just loops around the headrest. My husband installed it. It's okay. I would have preferred to use the tether for a more secured installation. But my baby girl does enjoy seeing herself and me through the mirror."
4,Lets me see the baby even without a center headrest,"Our SUV doesn't have a headrest for the center seat, but our child's carseat is centered in the backseat since that is the safest place to put it. I originally bought a Fisher Price mirror that I rigged to the left seat's headrest so I could see baby. That headrest always fell out of place whenever I drove over a bump. Then I bought the SafeFit Baby In Sight headrest and my husband was able to set it up on the left headrest with a decent view of the baby (who is still in the center seat). The mirror has stayed in place no matter how many bumps I've driven over. I gave the mirror four stars instead of five because I'd prefer if it was a little larger so I could have a better view of my child. Currently I can see his face on the side of the mirror and that is good enough for me, though I'd prefer if I had a better view. This mirror isn't great but it is good for vehicles that don't have a center head rest."
5,Every parent needs this!,This mirror has saved me! It is nerve racking to drive with a newborn in the back seat and not be able to see her! This mirror puts my mind at ease. I can see her reflection in my rear view mirror...or just as easily turn my head and check her mirror to see her. I highly recommend it!!
2,Could have been designed better,"I am with the mom's that are not very satisfied with this product. I am a dad with very good handy skills and this mirror is not easy to install. No decent directions either. We had to sew the velcro on the base of the unit because the heat melted the glue on the strap! It works fairly well in my wife's Buick Regal because it is a 2001 with tether straps in the rear window area. I drive an older Chevy Tahoe with headrests and it is still difficult to see my daughter. We had to put a tissue box under the mirror to get the correct angle! In addition, I also had a problem with one of the mirrors became very foggy and pretty much useless. I think I may come up with a better design and make some cash."
1,Also fogged,"I got this mirror as a baby shower gift, and was very exited because it was so large I was sure to see my baby.... but after about a month it started to ""fog"" and nothing I used to clean it helped. Now it doesn't reflect anything let alone my baby."
1,Don't buy this!!,I have been using this mirror for about a month and a half. About a week ago--the mirror started to (what I thought was)fog. I touched the mirror and it wasn't fog. I am in the process of trying to find the contact information to complain right to the company. I can't even see my daughter now because the mirror is coated with something which won't come off. I am frequently in stop and go traffic so it is nice to know what she is doing back there. I wouldn't buy this product again.
3,Eh...has some nice exercises,"Some of this is self explanatory. ""Keep an Open Mind"".Nonetheless, there are some good exercises to help you brainstorm, to come up w/ new ideas, or to flesh out new ones, if you're trying to be a writer, a poet, or an inventor. The so called ""Million Idea Generator"" Matrix is probably the best one, with the Metaphor Maker close behind. The book also contains some mind-bending/expanding exercises, visual illusions and word games to help you see beyond the obvious. Better to get this book used or from a book club."
3,Bellydancer in LA,"If you are looking for a Bellydance CD, this IS NOT. There is one song on the CD ""I wanna see you Belly Dance"" that is fun for a croud pleaser, but that's it. Read the other reviews to see what the CD is about. They do a great job of describing it. Don't buy if you thnk it's a Belly Dance CD."
3,Old Friends,"While Katie Fforde continues to use some of the same old cliches to hook our interest. That is why we come back to her time and time again, because sometimes the warmest reads are the predictable-heart-melting-make-you-sigh-in-spite-of-yourself love stories. Not one of her finest love yarns, yet it holds true to what Katie Fforde writes.The books you can curl up to when you need to be reminded that deep down we are ALL hopeless romantics."
5,the perfect book for case studies in microbiology,The case studies are seperatered by organ system. This is the first book I have ever used that has done this. When taking a microbiology course the pathogenic microbes are presented by organ system so this format suits the course perfectly. The case studies are so much fun to do it's like a puzzle and you end up studying without even knowing that you've been studying. This book is also great for anyone who just loves reading about disease causing microbes anyone who has read the coming plague should buy this book and have some fun with their new found knowledge and do some medical problem solving.
5,Heart warming aligory of forgiveness,"Unconditional love is always hard to understand. Its even harder to understand that God will not abandon you. In this story Sarah goes through the fires. She is refined. And, she realizes that ""he"" has not abandoned her"
3,Screeching Thru a Muzzle,"This book is okay. It's a great read when Weasel is talking about his old band, Screeching Weasel, but is completely boring when he drones on about past day jobs or solitary hobbies (like running). Some critics say Weasel is the punk-rock Charles Bukowski, but that's an inacurate comparison. Where Bukowski was brutally honest, Weasel is annoyingly evasive, choosing to hide behind his stadium-sized ego. This book would have been great if Weasel talked more about what helped make him a punk-rock celebrity, namely his ex-girlfriend of 10 years and his old band. That said, this book does have two fantastic articles, one on Weasel meeting Curt Kobain, the other -- previously unpublished -- on advice for novice musicians."
4,Worthy piece of equipment!,Definitely a buy if you want to add wallpapers and such to your phone! Just make sure to download the software bitpim to actually be able to use it!
4,USB Cable Review,"I assume the cable works fine, but I could never get it to do what it's supposed to do. It would have been nice to know that additional software was needed before I could use the USB cable to put music on my phone."
3,Driver download for Data Cable,"You need to find and download a driver for this cable before you can use bitPim. I found a driver that works for my Verizon LG Vx6000 here: http://www.igonemobile.com/downloads/index.aspxVerizon has Win XP drivers for many phones along with its free Music Manager download as of 7/2/07. It allows you to rip CDs and transfer the songs to your phone all in the same application.http://www.vzam.net/vcastmusic/step1.aspxLG Vx8600 headphone adapter is for a small 2.5mm stereo jack. You will need a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter for most headphones.The $30 Verizon Music Essentials data cable, SW CD and headphones is not a bad deal."
2,not for the novice,"Que provides a reasonably concise outline of HTML programming in a logical and readble format. But it's probably not possible to learn how to create a satisfactory web page from this book, contray to the book's premise. And even the experienced user will not read this book in 10 minutes, for goodness sake!If you are experienced with earlier versions of HTML and need a quick outline of version 4, this book probably is insufficient -- it simply lacks the detail I would guess you will need. If you are a novice, don't even pick up this one -- get Sams Teach Yourself HTML 4 in 24 hours."
2,Figment,"The game itself is fun, but it suffers from a HUGE problem that no software should in this day and age. It does not play inside of a window, but instead takes the whole screen. That's dumb. It means that's it's difficult to be doing anything else while playing this game. I expect better from a major company."
5,Betty Crocker Cookie Book,I bought a copy of this book more than twenty years ago and have used it many many times. In it is a recipe for Pumpkin Bars with cream cheese icing. They are the bomb! EVERYTIME make themI have to give someone the recipe. There are plenty of new cookie books available but none compare to tried and true Betty Crocker.
2,"After the Ice, was man really so simple?","A shallow and rather trite psuedo-scientific review, I find it difficult to believe he skipped over the really huge megalitic sites (Tiahunaco, Baalbek, etc) to focus on our ""evolution"". Animals and plants are miraculously domesticated -- There is much more to the history of man in the past 20,000 years than this basic repeating of the textbook history that's been taught in schools of Western (Eurocentric)thought for a long time. Some of it is interesting, though. An easy read."
5,Great saw great price,"i bought this saw a year ago and it cuts so smoothly,it makes the job so easy i would recommend that people buy this saw"
3,An interesting item,"A nice unit. I bought it mainly for the battery longevity and to try the new technology. I haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery longevity. Otherwise, probably it's best advantage is the light being ""close to natural light"". This can help in differentiating between dark brown, grey, or navy socks in a dark sock drawer. Or between olive green and charcoal grey slacks in a dark closet. Otherwise, it doesn't put out as much light as most other small flashlights, say, like a Maglite. The light-beam is more diffused, not focused at all. It likely would not help finding a dime you dropped on the pavement at night! Of limited use."
5,slumberjack,"went on a camping trip to Big Sur, CA. in May. Got this sleeping back for me and my girl. It had plenty of room and was very comfortable. It wasn't that cold, but was comfortable in the bag all night. It was easy to zip up. Happy with the purchase. This is a very large sleeping bag, definitely not for a backpacking trip. It comes with its own carry bag. Wouldn't even want to carry it very far from from the truck either. I would recommend this for couples that drive and camp."
5,Mickey Mantle???!!!,"I finished another book by Dan Gutman called ""Mickey & Me"". At first I thought it was about Mickey Mantle. Instead it was about girls baseball in 1944, and it was even BETTER. (Finally, there was something about Mantle, but it didn't matter.) Even the ""Facts and Fictions"" was terrific. Another CLASSIC!Dan, keep 'em coming, Kid!IraP.S. --- Do you remember Eddie Feigner, ""The King & His Court"", the 4-man softball team? He also has some interesting stuff, too. How about a book by Mr. Gutman called ""Eddie & Me""???"
2,tribute to godsmack:a slap in the face.,"i've been a godsmack fan since the beginning,and they've inspired alot of alt.metal bands and were themselves inspired by the great alice n chains. if i were sully,(and the rest of the band included),i'd be pissed that someone actually had the balls to produce such a compilation of crap!the artists covering the songs have no originality,well,maybe the females do a little.but the lead vox are the equivelant of rakeing nails on a chalkboard.i dont think hellen keller was as tone-deaf as this guy is.and god smack hasnt been around long enough to have a tribute album anyhow.are they trying to retire godsmack in there prime or what? if they were true fans of godsmack,they would've thought this out a little more thoroughly."
2,Superb Book,"I am a pastor and will heartily refer many of those I counsel to purchase this book. It offers many insightful ways to battle the spirit world. Montgomery teaches the reader how to take thoughts captive, the power of the tongue, and how to equip themselves for battle. Additionally, she unfolds her own past which inculded occultism and witchcraft, and her conversion to Christianity. It's a powerful book for both men and women. It also provides depth and enough information that you'll find yourself going back again and again to refamiliarize yourself with the spiritual techniques she teaches. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I bought copies for other people and they said the same thing."
5,Timeless advice,"Re-reading ""The Man Who Wore the Star"" after almost four years, I was struck by how the message has stood the test of time. Jim Kinnear shows that leadership stems not from ego or self-promotion, but from character. He reminds us that the best decisions are the ones that are right - not those that are easiest. A strong sense of ethics is not a barrier to suceeding - it is an essentialelement in success."
3,Wait for second edition,"This is the first edition, which covers PHP3 and PHP4. PHP5 has been out for a while and supports much more OOP. A second edition will probably require much rewriting."
1,fooled,"I just purchased this product at Walmart thinking it was Creedence Clearwater Revival. I opened it and played it before realizing it was not CCR but Studio 99. At that point, it was no longer returnable. I feel they are taking advantage of a copyright law to sell CD's that people would not ordinarily buy. The style of this cover is very deceptive. I will be more careful in the future."
3,Don't be fooled,"Be careful to read the description. i thought that this was an actual musical score (sheet music) having already bought the soundtrack, but it is actually a CD for the soundtrack for the movie. i suggest that amazon should change the name of this item but i doubt this will happen. i do like the music on CD and i do realise its my mistake for buying a second copy but my rating is for the naming of the item rater than the content."
3,Not the best Howard Shore,"This is a good score from the composer of the much better soundtracks ""The Game"" and ""Cop Land"". This film deserved a better piece of music,than this repetitive themes.Even so,i like it very much."
3,Great Stockings,These are great stockings but they dont stay up for long periods of time. I have to keep pulling them up.
5,"Tells the""truth"", with joy intact","This is a must-read for Christian children at Christmas. A child hears kids on the street say Santa isn't real, and goes inside to ask his father. The dad tells him that St. Nicholas was a real person who, because he loved Jesus, gave gifts to the poor. The boy is inspired by the story and decides to share with others, like St. Nick did. The book ends with a cheerful picture of Santa: ""As the family sat around and talked half the night, Todd thought he saw, in the snow and moonlight...a bright-eyed Saint Nicholas with his sack looking in, and wide across his face, a jolly old grin."" Children will know that the real Santa is now in heaven, but people still rememeber him today because of his generous spirit. The book tells the ""truth"" about Santa, while also allowing for a child's imagination and sense of joy to remain intact over who Santa was."
4,Good story,This is a great book about the real santa. I grew up not believing in Santa but my husband did. I did not want my children believing in only santa but Jesus also and this book satisfied me as far as beliving in santa and the true meaning of Christmas.
5,THIS CAR SEAT IS GREAT.,"No Complaints at all. If you are looking for a SAFE, light weight, comfortable for baby infant seat this is by far a great pick evenmore so if you have a peg perego stroller to go with."
2,"Pretty but too tight, too warm","We bought this car seat and the matching stroller. The stroller is amazing. However, my little one has been uncomfortable in this seat from the beginning. She sweats every time making the cold air shocking when she is removed from it. It is heavy and difficult to get in and out of the car. I have only used the car seat with the stoller two times and both times were a screaming fest. I don't recommend this car seat unless you are only interested in the aesthetics."
2,Dimensions,"I am so dissapointed in this seat. My son is 3 months old and has outgrown it. For the person who said the dimensions are just about the same as the others it is not true. Yes we know it is narrower but the big problem is THE DEPTH. If you compare the Peg Perego is only about 17"" deep while Graco for instance is about 25"" deep!!!! Therefore, it does not have to be as long since the baby is sitting deeper in the seat. Just wanted to mention that because when shopping for another seat recently I noticed ""the height"" on Graco was actually less than the Peg Perego yet my babies feet did not hang out and then I compared and it is because of the depth. Much happier now that my son doesnt scream his head off going in his seat!!!"
2,Italian babies must be really skinny.....,"Because my lil guy outgrew this carseat after just a few months. The seat is very deep and narrow which early on seemed like a good thing. It provides a newborn with more support etc. But my only slightly chubby boy soon needed a crowbar to get out of this seat. He had no wiggle room whatsoever and began to protest being put in it. So after a few months we switched to a Graco metrolite which is wider and allowed him to wave his arms around.On the plus side, it's a really nice looking carseat with quality fabric."
2,Not as good as i would have hoped,We purchased this carseat a few months before our first son was born. The install was very difficult and took alot of effort to get in correctly. Our son was born at 9 lbs 6 oz and the day we took him home the straps where on the very top slot. He grew out of it within 3 months of being born. It was far to heavy and we would just pull him out because it was to much weight for us to carry around. His shoulders also seemed squished even as a newborn. It didnt seem very comfortable to me at all. We also purchased the Atlantico stroller (which has since been discontinued) but i have to say we love this stroller it has been wonderful. We are now expecting a new baby and have purchased the Britax Companion carseat and I LOVE THIS SEAT. I will never purchase another seat but Britax ever again.
1,Disappointed,"Just a point of consideration for anyone buying this carseat and intending on using it in a Jeep Cherokee. I installed it and verified that it was installed correctly with the local police department. If you have leather seats, grab the head side of the base - the side furthest away from the latch - you can totally lift it and simulate a FACE-PLANT of your child into the vertical part of the seat. This movement is similar to the rebound that would happen during a crash. I don't know how this product was ever approved as it is a skull-crusher at high impact. I returned it immediately."
5,I love this car seat!,"I am very happy with this product. It is light weight and works great with the Pliko Matic stroller. It is definitely designed with safety in mind and the fabric is so nice for baby It does cost more $$ then some of the others but after doing lots of research I personally found this to be a great seat. I know the snugride by Graco is also good but I did not like the material and thought some of them were bulky and slightly flimsy. I have heard people complain about Peg Pergeo products and I guess you can't please everyone. I believe nothing is perfect but this comes pretty close. Also the picture here does not do its justice although looks which are one of the purks of Peg Perego it is not the most important asset of this seat, safety and comfort are."
2,not worth the money,"I have never written a review but always read them when purchasing a baby product so felt the urge to share my experience with this product. I will admit I bought this car seat because of the look and the brand name. I now wish I had not been such a label snob. I see other babies in their Gracos, etc and they look so comfortable and my poor 3 1/2 month old looks stuffed in his car seat. This car seat is very narrow. My baby is only 14 pounds and I do not see him fitting in this much longer. Also, I was starting to think my baby sweat a lot until I read other reviews. It seems that other parents have had the same problem with the fabric. When I take my baby out the area where his head was is often wet with sweat. Also, warning label has frayed off. The look of this car seat is great I will admit but it is not worth it."
2,Many changes needed,"I agree with the reviewer from PA. This is a very small seat that costs alot of $$. I found the sun shade too small, the chest clip difficult, seat is very heavy, material is hot and does not breathe-- you get the point. I bought this seat because of the Peg perego name and the look of the seat. Too bad they can't make a seat that works as good as it looks."
2,"Heavy, small and hot","Our daughter is only 4 months old and she can't fit anymore in this car seat! I mean it! I can't even sit her in it!It is very heavy, she gets hot in it and very uncomfortable. We didn't believe the reviews before we bought it; the first month it was ok, but as our daugher started growing (she is now 18lbs 10oz and 26""), the seat got heavier and heavier and it is a pain to even take it out of the car or move it from her bedroom to the door with her in it.It may be safer, but for only 4 months of use (in which we did not take her out in the car a lot) it's not worth the money.I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1!) for safety; the baby stays very snug (and uncomfortable) in it.If you have enough money to buy another car seat in 4 months and muscle to move it around, buy it. If not ... DO NOT BUY IT!!!Buy Britax instead!!!Update ... We bought Britax Decathlon in Tiffany print and she looooooves it."
2,Shoppers Dilema,"While I love the looks of this car seat and thought that Peg was the best way to go, I have found that the car seat does not work well with many shopping carts. It does not snap into the carts properly , so I have to shop with one hand and either hold onto my baby with the other or put the entire car seat into the cart and grocery shop more often because I don't have as much space."
5,We love this car seat!!!,This car seat was everything we expected it to be. Top three reasons why we and our baby loves it.1. Safety- With the 5-point safety harness2. Ease of use- Get baby in and out the car with the latch system3. Comfort- Our baby is comfortable and happy in it
1,Consumer Alert!,"Do not get fooled by the expensive price tag! Before you buy this one, go to the store and physically compare it to the other brands. You will see how heavy it is and how narrow the seat is. Not to mention the useless canopy and the clumsy handle. I absolutely regret buying it! My son outgrew it at 3 1/2 months which is WAY BEFORE reaching the weight and height limit. He was just so miserable in it (the seat was too tight for his shoulders) he screamed every time he was going in. I thought I haven't adjusted it properly but after reading the reviews online I understood that this is a very commom problem. I can't believe this car seat is still on the market!!! STAY AWAY FROM IT!"
1,Makes baby hot,"This car seat makes my baby sweaty and hot on even the shortest rides. This being summer in DC, so not worth it. My baby often cries when we put her in the seat. I can tell she will also be outgrowing it soon because the length is not long enough. The retractable sun shade is virtually useless and barely covers baby's head. Do not recommend this product."
5,Great cardstock,"This turned out to be exactly what I was hoping it to be: good quality, nice cardstock in beautiful colors. Would definitely order again."
5,LOVE IT,"Greta Garbo is absolutely my favorite actress every. The three silent films that are in this set are amazing work. Every film in this collection is great. Flesh and the Devil is the best out of the silents. Her first speaking film Anna Christie is great. Anna Christie has both an English version and a German version of the film, both are great. Grand Hotel doesn't have that much Garbo in it but the other spectacular cast members make up for Garbo's lack of screen time. The movie that surprised me the most was Ninotchka. I knew it was supposed to be a comedy, but it was much more hilarious than I anticipated. I'm only a young man but I love old, classic movies and these ten are my pride and joy of my whole collection."
5,Perfect CD,Kudos to Solido!!!!!!!! Each CD they put out seems to get better and better. They always blow me away with their lyrics and instrumental capabilities. I love this CD and it will go in the top shelf of my dresser with the other two CDs. Keep up the good work!
4,"Loved the recipes, but you won't find most of them at home","These cards first caught my eye at the recent Photography Expo here in Los Angeles. When I found out that they were actually being sold at bookstores, I picked one up right away. The pictures of the backs of the cards are aesthetically pleasing. The recipes for massage oils and facials I tried were good, but the only problem is that you need to buy most of the ingredients, and if you really want them to work, you need to pay the highest price for them. For example, most of them use essential oils, and there are several you need to ""stock up on"". I think the oils cost around $6.00 for a small bottle.I would prefer a book that utilizes home ingredients that we could all find in our kitchens, but I would recommend this for special occasions, like if you are celebrating an anniversary and are planning a weekend getaway."
1,Music?,"I have to give a lot of respect for a couple of pre-teens to go on tour, make music, display some showmanship. This has got to be a big boost for all of you young'uns out there. Positive music is a good thing.But I gotta be honest - I'm not really thrilled with this group. When my buddy played it for me (or forced me to listen to it while he grilled out last week, however you want to interpret it), it sounded like Disney decided to produce an album from four of its karaoke contest winners. Emmi, Brittany, Kelsey, and whatever the fourth one's name is, should stick to studies and contribute meaningfully to society by discovering cures for cancer, becoming US ambassadors, or piloting shuttles into outer space. We seriously don't need another Hansen.You may point out at this juncture that Hansen was different because they were boys, not girls. You can not convince me of this, though.For serious talent from young artists, try Charlotte Church."
5,His techniques wont work for everybody,"Ron's techniques wont work for everyone and that's ok, more for the rest of us. To really understand the book you have to listen to some of his tapes. The concepts that he uses in his book don't give away all the information, so if you are looking for step by step instructions this may not be for you. But if you are a serious student buy or borrow one of his tapes, listen to it and then read the book and you will get more out of it. I have used the lease option and ""free houses"" technique and believe it or not it works like a charm."
1,Selling Company is impossible to deal with!!!,"I received the APC RBC11 and tried to plug it in to the battery backup, I noticed the plugs weren't connecting correctly. I called my company's IT company and they came out to see why it wasn't fitting. I guess I needed to order RBC55 instead of RBC11. I tried to return it to this company to no avail; I even offered to pay the shipping and a restocking fee, but they wouldn't take the return. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone BASED ON their customer service, or lack there of."
5,All the World's a Theory,"In Imaginary Communities, Wegner glides from heady theorists like Jameson and Zizek to popular fiction like Dissposessed and to ""cannonical classics"" like 1984. Always readable, always introducing and always challenging, Wegner traces the evolution of the 'uptopia' novel while reorienting our reading of distopias by asking 'who's utopia are they?' Wegner sets up the concept of utopia as a mode of reading, asking us to position the texts we encounter in terms of it and in terms of social space as well, thus he discusses nation building and the onset of modernity in terms of the development of the utopia novel. Far reaching and deeply penetrating, whether you're a professor of literature, an avid sci-fi fan, an activist, or even an urban design specialist, Imaginary Communities is a 'place' worth visiting."
1,They Have Got to Have Run Out of Titles,"This will be forever on my top ten worst titles list. I think it just edged out The Oldest Living Married Virgin (a Silhouette title but Harlequin owns Silhouette so it probably makes no matter).Imagine the conversation with your friends:""Hey, I'm reading Madame Bovary, what are you readings?""""A Hickey for Harriet.""*Snort*"
1,She had an opportunity...,"To do a better book. I'm not sure this is stuff any normal person would want to do on a weekend. I mean, using an old tire as a planter? An old filing cabinet? Katie...that's called a junk yard. Trash heap. I think you get cited for that stuff in most towns."
2,Predictable and boring,"How cliche'd can one get? This is pseudo-Spanish pop music. The music and lyrics are sooo predictable it's not even worth it. I was given this CD by some friends in Spain and it was totally forgetful. The one hit (Bye Bye) with its funny dance was good while partying in spain (being ""happy"" also helped). You're much better off by getting his singles..."
2,MR. Civera and The Little Little Boring Band,"God.!!!!..Sorry but i have to say this: I can't stand listen the complete cd, cause is soooo boring, He try to be fun, but at the end this become to a ""pseudo-tropical"" latin party...Anyway, some tracks like "" QUE LA DETENGAN"" ""AMOR DE HIELO"" and ""ROSAS y ESPINAS"" can be fun. Buy it just if you're crazy...or if you are a huge fan of Civera."
4,Pretty color,I ordered these for a friend to make earrings out of them for a breast cancer event. The color is perfect. The earrings turned out great!
4,My daughter loved them,The picks were cute and work the same as any other. They did take a long time to get here but it's only because they were out of stock. My daughter won't use the standard picks if these colors are readily available.
3,Great costume for the price,"I bought this costume for my daughter's Scooby themed 4th birthday, and while the costume was priced to sell, the costume ripped in the 1st hour she had it on. The bottom hem of the dress ripped off and I was a little disappointed, but I can't complain considering what I paid for it I guess."
2,Wanted more From DVD of Footballs Biggest Game,"This is a DVD that could have and (in my oppinion )should have offered a lot more for the average football fan to view.NFL films does a great job of recapping the Bucs Run To Glory but we see nothing about the Raiders or any other team for that matter.It would have been nice to have added even a snippet of the other playoff games, and how can you have a SuperBowl DVD without any footage of the half time show.The actual game is only shown in fast highlights.There where a few nice extra features such as a behind the scenes look at the events going on in San Deigo on Super Bowl week, but over all I was very disppointed with this DVD.Hopefully Next Year we will get the Full Uncut Game with some Decent Extras, like the Biggest game deserves."
3,ITS OK BUT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,"This is a OK Dvd especially if your a Bucss fan like me but as I am watching this Dvd I got the sense that it could have been more than just Ok. The documentary that highlights every game from the season is ok and so are the rest of the features but why not some interviews with the players after the Superbowl some day or why the Buccs homecoming and the parade ?You got a lot of space on a Dvd and it has not been taken advantage of. Especially player interviews could shed some light on how it is to win a Superbowl and how the players react after that win. The parade would really round off the season and you could see the fans going nuts after finally winning a championship. To bad NFL Films, try harder next time."
1,Facts On File Should Know Better,"There is not a thing wrong with the text of this book. It is well written and informative. The problem is that this book claims to be an updated edition. We've been able to find no changes from the prior edition. In my opinion, this is tantamount to defrauding schools and libraries with limited budgets, not to mention the folks who work hard to pay the taxes. Buy the version that's not updated. You'll get the same product probably for a better price and let Facts On File know that such conduct is not appreciated."
1,CAVALLOMINTS is wrong,ITs not desire!!!IT s another one maybe INSX...good vocals by enigk ...the best singer of all indie metal
5,Great,"Its just right, it's everything it said it was. Works perfectly and so quiet. Goes with the room it was brought for."
1,Overly LOUD unit,"I am giving this fridge a 1 star rating as my first fridge is FAR TOO LOUD (in my opinion) for such a small unit. I am toying with replacing it, but also with the idea of just returning it for a refund. Has anyone had a ""LOUDNESS"" issue with this TINY fridge?"
2,Not What I Expected,I think I was disappointed when I opened the book that the instructions are in black and white instead of color. The cover of the book looked great and I expected to open the book and find color photos of each item with instructions. Instead -- You have to go to the middle of the book and look at the color photos jammed on a few pages -- and go back to the page where the instructions are. I have seen better books. The ideas are great -- but line drawings are hard to follow.
1,Disappointing,"My husband bought me this book as a gift because I wanted to cook more meatless dinners for our family. I was very excited and really wanted to like this book because it did have a big selection of tasty ""sounding"" dishes, but recipe after recipe was really quite bland, maybe this is how vegetarian food is supposed to taste? Or a recipe (pasta) called for a stick of butter and was overly salty (was I supposed to use unsalted butter because it didn't say that?) A lot of the recipes included a lot of prep work and were time consuming which I wouldn't mind if the dish didn't come out just kind of BLAH which I found a lot of times was the case. I'll keep shopping."
1,Not a healthy vegetarian cookbook,"I agree completely with the people who gave this book a low rating. The book is heavy on dairy (milk and butter). I read on the WW blog that it was recommended - but I don't understand how that can be. If a person on WW ate from the recipes in this book, they would be on WW FOREVER! Can't even resell this book for what I paid for it.I may try later to revamp some of the recipes to be more health conscious by substituting healthier ingredients."
1,What's the point?,"If you received the USB cable with your Sidekick you already know that the only thing you can really do with this cable is watch it sit in the box. There are no connectivity applications available at this time that utilize the USB cable for the Sidekick. No sync functions, no downloadable ringtones, no nothing! Makes you wonder why they even included it with some of the devices ;-/ If you are thinking of getting a cable in the hopes of playing with these types of things on your Sidekick, take my advice, save the six bucks and go buy yourself some lunch. It will be a far better deal and infinitely more satisfying!"
5,Pickin' On Even Better Randy Travis Albums,"I do not own this CD but being a BIG fan of him leads me to recognise all of these songs. Every one of them are great. His nice smooth voice rings out clearly in each song, slow or up beat. Though you won't go wrong buying this CD you would do even better getting The Essential Randy Travis. There are a few more hits on that album. I will go even furthur in telling you that getting The Very Best Of Randy Travis would be a smart buy because it contains 20 of his all-time greatest hits on it! Even though the Essential Travis and The Very Best Of Travis albums do not have the songs, 1982 , Allergic To The Blues, and Bound For Glory on them, they are replaced by even better songs(that's just my opinion).'Nuff said. Make a decision. Hope I helped you."
5,Intelligent noir,"The Bottom Line:If you love the twisted morality and dark shadows of film-noir but are tired of watching private detectives follow convoluted plots, check out In a Lonely Place, a 1950 Bogart picture about a woman who starts to wonder if her boyfriend is capable of murder; with a very good Bogart in the lead and a brief 94-minute running time, In a Lonely Place is a fine example of the genre.3.5/4"
3,Bridge At Remagen,An action protrayal of an important event of World War II. I think you will like this if you like historical movies with the additions of Hollywood.
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"It seemed I remembered this movie as nothing special, but hey, I got it cheap. Well, it turned out my memory is not that good. The film has about as much continuous action as you could ask for in a war movie, and it's all well acted and produced. It doesn't have the character development of the greatest war movies, but it is certainly more enjoyable than most!"
1,Not smart,"Maybe this book would have been insightful 30 years ago, but I don't think it was ""college level"" even then. It didn't offer any useful advice on how to actually repair psychological damage. And the exercises always came to obvious, dogmatic conclusions.If you're an introspective person, then there probably isn't anything in this book that you haven't thought of already. I can see how it might save a little time for a therapist to hand out at the beginning of a comprehensive treatment, but it certainly isn't going to be the last (or even middle) step in the healing process.After each chapter I found myself asking, ""Yes I know that, now what do I do about it!?"" And then at the end of the book I thought, ""This is exactly where I started."""
2,Disappointing self help book,"I purchased this book in the hopes it would shed some light on why my husband of 33 years has always had a very low libido. His testosterone levels are normal, and there is no physical reason. My thinking was that it must have come from his experiences growing up. It has been very hard on our marriage living with someone who seldom wants sex and is perfectly happy that way. However, the book seems to be slanted more towards women with libido problems, not men. It has a bunch of questionairres that have no validity in our case, and it also doesn't really explain what might cause this, or if there is any way to cure it. I honestly couldn't see where it would be much help to anyone, male or female, with this problem. I didn't even bother to have my husband read it, as it would have been a waste of time for him. A waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
4,Insightful and accessible,"This book takes you through a tour about personal development and the effects on sexuality. Its clear, methodic and with many examples. Good for humanistic counselors and for introspective work as well. College level."
3,Not what was expected...,"It said it was used like new...but it wasn't quite like new. The box was damaged, and after checking each of the 42 dvd's, I found five or six that were scratched. After watching some, I have even found one or two that aren't being recognized in my DVD player. For the most part I guess it's what I paid for, but I am disappointed. If you say it's like new, it should be in that condition for all the pieces."
5,Enjoyable,"I have enjoyed the Gilmore Girls and like the option of having it close at hand. The packaging isn't the best, but the price versus the single years is better. The ""barbie doll box"" affair is hard to store, too. But the value is great. Enjoying!"
5,On time and perfectly shipped,All the videos where in perfect order and the package came with plenty of cushion for the ride over. The delivery was fast and prompt. I would not hesitate to order from this person/seller in the future.
2,displeased so far,"Received this set for Mother's Day--it was the only thing I asked for. Well, thus far I have played two of season 7 and there is audio overlay on both cd's. Now to wade thru the Amazon maze of customer service to try and get this corrected. The barbie-doll case also fell apart the second time we opened it....I would expect more for $170 plus. I hope I can get satisfaction with replacement......I will update on that."
1,Great Show -- Bad DVD Set!,"I LOVE Gilmore Girls, but unforunately this set is terrible. The quality of the discs is so poor that many of them would not play in my DVD player. And one of the discs was printed with the Gilmore Girls packaging, but actually contained Star Trek: The Next Generation!"
2,Faulty discs,"I'm just now watching the ""Gilmore Girls"" series purchased as new some months ago as a gift. Unfortunately I didn't have time to check this product earlier. I'm on Season 5 and every disc so far has glitches with color hazing, skipping and stopping at times. I've stopped and restarted to get through the disc, cleaned and recleaned the player and skips continue. I tried Disc #24 several times on two different DVD players and it appears to be completely blank!Love this series, but this is a disappointment.April 25...I am now on Season 7 and again find all discs very difficult to run. I've tried them on multiple players {cleaned DVD players multiple times}, and again the first disc appears to have no information on it.This is a very nicely packaged series with very faulty discs throughout each season. A great disappointment."
5,Great for rewatching when you're in a Gilmore Girls kind of mood,"We got this for an amazingly low price--a low price to pay to have your favorite Gilmore Girls episode on hand when you're in the mood to watch it. The packaging is cute, and there's a nice booklet with summaries of all the episodes. The extra DVD features aren't that great, but the shows themselves are fantastic."
2,Cute but bad discs,"The books were cute that were included with the dvd seasons. The carrying case was nice, but several discs didn't work. Am returning it and ordering the seasons individually so hopefully won't get any faulty discs."
3,Michael Creepy,"I was relieved in reading some other reviews that I'm not the only one who thinks this film was plain and ordinary, and bordering on ""bad"". I really wanted to see this, the previews made it look so interesting. The story and some of the acting came off as very creepy. The performance of Tom Wilkinson made me feel nervous and edgy, not a good feeling. The way ""Michael Clayton"" was filmed also gave me a feeling of disconnect, with the pale colours and drab scenery, more creepiness. You can't deny the good acting by Tom Wilkinson, George Clooney and Tilda Swinton. That is why I gave it 3 stars but I just couldn't get through the whole movie, I turned it off towards the end. I guess I'm not into all the government conspiracy, spying, survalence type movies like this and ""Bourne Ultimadum"". It's not entertainment in my oppinion. I did like ""Breach"". That should have been nominated for academy awards, not this."
2,Story so so. Worth only a rental but not an HD purchase.,"Story was o.k. but not riveting. Great performances? Certainly not the movie I saw (and I've seen a lot of movies). I don't dislike George Clooney but his acting performance again reveals one-dimensional acting. Yes, he looks good on the screen but his character doesn't differ from one movie to the next. Tilda Swinton Academy Award. . .for that small part she had? Diminishes the Oscar's worth. I rented the DVD version. Cinematography not conducive for exhibiting the quality of HD-DVD or Blu Ray visuals. Save your money and rent it if you must. Overpriced."
2,One of the most boring movies,"I for one can sit threw boring movies but this one takes the cake. I feel asleap durning the first 20 minutes and wroke up at around 10 minutes before the movie ended. I was tired and all but when i see a interesting, good movie and about to fall asleap i turn it off and take a nap and see the movie later. I had no desire to do this with this movie.I now never going to see a George Clooney movie ever again. Good night and good luck was boring it felt like a second rate tv movie. The movies he does with his buddy Soderbergh suck as well. The worst one is the Good German which features the worst miscast in movie history. Tobey Mcguire as a villian who beats his women is so bad it is laughable. His only good movie is Three Kings. His problem is that he only knows how to play himself and his movies are made for the older demographic."
1,Absolutely the worst!,"This George Clooney is the worst movie I've seen of his. I had to cut it off, not even his good looks could save it for me. The plot is impossible to follow, if it even exists. I will have to be getting rid of my copy, not worth keeping or trying to watch again!"
4,Legal Cover-up/Thriller,"Filmed in New York and Wisconsin, George Clooney and Sydney Pollack provide excellent performances, as do the other actors. Michael Clayton (Clooney), once a brilliant litigator for a legal firm, has become a ""fixer"". He ""fixes"" things. He gets caught up in a web of deceit and cover-up and finds out something that puts his life in jepoardy. Although a little slow, it is not too slow. It is interesting watching the plot and characters unfold. It is about the legal system, law suits, and cover-ups and is similar in plot to the Erin Brockovitch movie."
4,Michael Clayton - Big Thumbs Up,"This was a damned fine movie. Its not just a drama, there is a mystery and a bit of a thriller going on. The flashback really does this movie a service in terms of making you anxious to fill in the pieces of the puzzle. The script was quick and the tension palpable. I hate lawyers and don't much like George Clooney outside of a movie theater but this was a damened good movie about lawyers and another damned good performance by Mr. Clooney.Tilda Swinton was entertaining and believable but she wasn't in the movie for very long to appear to be eligible for her oscar win. Were there really not much further fleshed out female supporting actress roles in the 1-200 plus movies released this year? Oh Well."
4,Legal Thriller with George Clooney,"Michael Clayton brings a legal thriller about a corporate cover up, a manic depressive lawyer, and the firm fixer played by George Clooney and Academy-Award winning actress for her role in this film Tilda Swinton as a hard nosed in house Counsel. Lots of dark places and complications about the nature of unwinding a cover up and the dangers of the truth."
4,Another Solid Clooney Pic,I generally like Clooney movies because he tends to perform in movies where characters have direct and genuine exchanges with each other which allows me to empathize with each character's role in the plot.
5,One of the best George Clooney films ever.,"Michael Clayton (George Clooney) works for a large law firm. He's a lawyer but the firm won't let him practice law because he's too good at fixing the law firm's messes. When the firm's top lawyer experiences a breakdown, Michael must clean up the defense of a chemical plant land contamination. Three billion dollars are at stake and Michael has a lot on his plate - not to mention his financial and family problems.This was one of Sydney Pollack's last movies and he is terrific as one of the firm's big shot lawyers. Tilda Swinton received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role as legal counsel for the chemical plant.A great movie thriller and one of the best George Clooney films ever."
2,"Decent movie, but very slow moving... not for short attention span","Clooney's performace is good, as is everyone elses, but the story is much slower moving than previews imply (they show -all- the action scenes in the previews). It was OK if you have the patience and like very slow moving, deep, thought provoking films about corporate legal dirt, but people with short attention spans, or those expecting a little action, will be disappointed. I thought it was fairly good, but my wife was bored out of her mind. (I have more tolerance for slow, deep thinking movies than she does.)"
4,Good thriller,"Well told thriller about corporate lawyers and what they do to protect their clients. George Clooney plays a guy you kind of root for, even though he's doing the devil's work, just because he does it so well and so smooth. Even he doesn't like what he does, but he knows that this is his place in life. Until, of course, events occur that make him re-assess himself, and he struggles with the answers. Well acted, and really well directed."
2,MICHAEL CLAYTON,A MOVIE THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH UNTIL THE END IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE THE ENTIRE MOVIE.
3,Over-rated,"I thought this movies was over-rated. George Clooney did do a good job acting though. The ending seemed kind of a let down. I felt they could have done more with the movie all-in-all. I was really looking forward to seeing Michael Clayton and was disappointed overall. Of course, anytime George Clooney is in a movie, it can't all be bad. ;)"
3,Laws and the Corporate State,"Interesting little story pitting a ""Mr Fix-it"" attorney for a large Manhattan law firm who gets caught up in the battle between right and wrong and the Corporate State's greed for profit."
1,I did not like this DVD. The script was not interesting.,See above. I did not like this DVD. The ending was weird and below standards.
4,Entertaining movie with good acting from Clooney,"George Clooney plays the part of Michael Clayton very well. He's not your everyday attorney; he's the guy his firm turns to when they have a problem that needs to be taken care of quietly.In this case, he's trying to reign in a senior partner who had a meltdown during a (filmed) deposition involving a large company whose products are harmful to the farm community. It all takes place during a planned merger and the senior partner's actions could jeopardize the merger.So Michael Clayton is called in to ""fix"" things and in the process his own life is threatened. The film holds your attention because you get to see Clayton struggle with his own personal issues, while trying to do his job, which is causing him some ethical concerns as well.The basic storyline isn't new, but the actors are believable and the story is entertaining. It's a movie worth watching."
3,"OK, but a missed opportunity","The writers missed a great opportunity for a better story line with Arthur. If he was the shark others were afraid of facing across the table or in court, his talents could have been pitted against the ""fixer"" with Arthur using his legal brilliance and go-for-the throat tactics against the client he has come to loathe and clearing his tortured conscious. Tilda Swinton's and Sydney Pollack's characters were good. Overall, an OK film."
3,Native American Religions,"Native American Religions, by Paula R. Hartz, was very enlightening. This book covered many aspects of native American religions and trsditions. There were many things that I learned while reading this book. This a great source for research and very educational. I recommend this book to anyone dfoing research on Native American religions and culture."
4,Ordered Wrong,"After receiving the PhotoShop CS3, which Adobe had suggested I order, it turned out that Adobe told me wrong and I couldn't use it.However, the seller didn't hesitate to take it back and give me a full refund. He was very nice to deal with and always replied promptly.I would highly recommend this seller."
1,Installation Problems under Vista,"Adobe Photoshop CS3Installing Photoshop under Vista fails unless a Java script ""jscript.dll"" is registered. The Adobe installer just quits with ""internal error 2739"". There is no mention of the problem in the product litrature. The Adobe website has a link to this particular error (dates 2007/07/09) but the link doesn't work.I spent almost two hours talking to customer service over a very bad line to someone in India who could barely speak English (they couldn't access the online solution article either and had to leave me on hold several times).The solution is to run the Java script in a DOS window in the correct directory (most important).A highly irritating experience.I have yet use the software but it is installed and running."
2,JLA Vs TITANS,"talk, talk, talk, talk, talk? . I know the important of the plot , I don't care much usually about the writers , but those names David GRAYSON & Phill JIMENZ I'll remember , the whole story is about syburg rebuilding him self and sleep walking him self to earth capturing the moon and threatening every living thing on earth .kidnapping the Titans (to keep them close to him as a family) they manage to wake up to realize what he is and ending up facing the JLA to defend their friend in a battle , which batman use for their advantage .of course you can tell its a good story , but through out the story I couldn't find what I always wont in a comic , for all is so confusing , with wards flooding all over the story , like a long non imaginative novel , though the ending would please anyone a s syburg return to the titans in his new suit and freshen the Titans blood , you'll find that its the only lovely tale in the entire comic book."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This product is described as having ""hassle-free setup"", but even the instructions that come with it tell you it is ""extremely difficult"" to get the last crossbar pulled into place. Make that ""impossible"". I even tried a crowbar and still managed to injure my hand in the attempt. I had to return it, and the return postage was $26! An expensive mistake."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"This book is the Bible of MMPI-2 interpretation. Dr. Graham does an amazing job presenting the information in an intelligent and understandable manner. There's a new chapter on the RC scales and the PSY-5 scales which will be incredibly important for people to learn about as these scales are going to be getting a lot of attention. The RC scales are the centerpiece of the new MMPI-2-RF, and the PSY-5 scales are on the new RF and involve individual difference personality trait theory. Plus, Graham includes cases and a interpretation strategies. Very helpful."
2,Out of date - go with new edition,"While most of this version is the same as the new, there is a big difference. There is very little about the RC scales and the PSY-5 scales in this edition. For a more accurate interpretation the newer edition is needed. I basically wasted my money on this only to have to purchase the newer edition."
3,MMPI,This book arrived in pretty good condition - except that the corners of the book/book cover were dog-eared and made the book look like it had been used (supposed to be brand new).
5,Rock tumbler accessory kit,"This review is for the AR-1 rock tumbler, plus accessories. We have been running the tumbler, non stop, since Feb. 19th and it's doing great. The rocks that come w/ the kit are turning out to be very cool, also. I would highly recommend this tumbler over the plastic 'toys' featured on websites, like Amazon. Don't even bother with the cheap tumblers; spend a little more to get a Thumler's or Lortone brand."
3,Near-useless,"An introduction to role playing that couldn't - Dicing with Dragons tries to center on the idea of RPGing, but quickly descends into a mash of specifics from different game systems and author's observations. It even includes a mini-solo adventure."
5,Great pump for traveling and short term use,Easy to use and clean. Great pump for traveling and short term use. I wouldn't recommend for long term since it does take some time. Also good for hand workouts ;p. The Ameda purely yours electric pump is great for long term use.
2,Not for VB Programmers,"I agree with one of the previous reviews that the topics were all over the place. The points thatwere presented were in bits and pieces and none of the exmaples were actually start-to-finish code.What code was presented was primarily C# and the VB code that was selected as parallel implementationswas not functional. If you are a VB.Net programmer looking for good books with sample code for the DirectoryServices Classes, you are better off using the Object Browser in Visual Studio and following the definitions yourself."
4,A nice collection,"This is a rather nice collection but merely another collection. I bought this CD for the new and previously unreleased songs but the new songs are not that great. Nana is the greatest singer in the world and she has produced some fantastic music. This CD just doesn't quite live up to Nana standards. I purchased ""The Complete English Works"" soon after purchasing this CD and, had I known Nana would be coming out with an English box set I might not have purchased this CD. Nana has produced some excellent work since 2005. Check out ""Moni Perpato"", ""Tragoudia apo ta Ellinika nisia"" (Songs from the Greek islands)and ""Rendez-Vous""."
4,A lovely book,"This book makes a beautiful gift: The photographs are breathtaking and are paired with quotations about San Francisco. It is a pleasure to look at, and it truly captures some of the more fleeting aspects of the City."
1,Just buy the book.,"dont waste your money, just buy his book. the information in this video is way to vague to really learn anything."
3,Low sample rate player,This is a very interesting method of distributing audio books. This could be a great way to listen if you don't have your own MP3 player. I was disapointed with the audio quality. I normally buy books on CDs which are much higher quality. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. But you may want to get it on CDs.
3,does it work???,"it's very nice to see that people like the authors writing style,but when a book has pratice that works then thats what people want to know about.Has anyone found success with RV from the techniques in this book?? no one cares about fancy writing...DOES OR DOESN'TT IT WORK??????.. that what i'd like to know"
4,remote viewing,David Morehoouse's book on remote viewing is one of the best I have read up to this date. I would love to meet the man.
5,Excellent Book,"This book is excellent! This is probably one of the best XP books I've read. Very to the point, no fluff. This is very easy to read and is a great reference and how-to book. It covers everything I've needed since I got it and I use it almost daily now to look up how to do something. I also like to just go through several sections just to learn something new (or refresh my memory on things I don't do often. I would recommend this book for about anyone at about any level, it's a great reference to have around.I don't have 2000, but everything for XP has been very accurate..."
1,I suffered for you!!!,"That's right, I paid the price and watched it so you don't have to!This is easily the worst movie of the year whatever the year is. I actually rate -5. I mean it has significant negative redeeming value. But there is no getting back my time or IQ points I lost.It is nothing but a set of beaten to death cliches. Add to this horrible acting, plot that will insult your intelligence (if you have any), and there you have it.If your life depended on watching this movie - choose death."
1,Unbelievable plot!,"Even though it looks like an important sum of money has been spent on making this movie -having been shot in Thailand, Prague, Moscow and the U.S.A.-, that isn't enough to keep the audience interested in following the unbelievable and typically low budget plot.Not even Martin Sheen's, Edward Burns' or Ving Rhymes' appeareances help this undoubtedly forgettable film."
4,Echelon Conspiracy,"War Games meets Die Hard with Ving Rhames, Edward Burns, and Shane West driving the bus. The action was fast and furious with hints about the underlying story. Finally a female character who isn't wearing heels and letting the men do the fighting -- Tamara Feldman kicked butt. It was fast-paced but with enough story to keep the tension high. Highly recommended for those of us who are action junkies who want a plot."
5,War crimes,"This is a very compelling story about the atrocities to which members of the Japanese army subjected a young Filipina girl. It is difficult, at times, to read and certainly not a book I would recommend for young readers. However, it definitely raised my awareness of the issue and the horrors experienced by these ""comfort women"". It also showed the resilience of women to love and survive again after such deplorable experiences."
1,Comfort Woman: A Filipina's Story of Prostitution and Slavery Under the Japanese Military,"Comfort Woman: A Filipina's Story of Prostitution and Slavery under the Japanese MilitaryThe sample I read was good. After buying the book, however, I was very disappointed. It reads more like a rough draft with incomplete statements and hanging paragraphs. Example below.""The neighbors were beginning to wonder why the landlord was at their house so often.support Don Pepe gave her family kept them alive. Her salary was too small to feed six brothers and sisters.Julia did not want to go back to work in the big house.""For the price, not worth it."
3,My Thoughts about Pharaoh's Daughter,"This book was very interesting. I thought it explained a lot about some of the life styles of the Egypians. IT kinda of confused me when the main characters were switch, but it was also interesting because you got to see the book from two different characters views. It also explains about the culture of moses and how he was torn between them. I also liked how the story expressed more of the palace life that moses experianced and the people who raised him."
3,So-So,I got this book out of the school library. I enjoyed Part 1 very much. But Part 2 i just didnt like. Part 1 tells about a moses's sisters life. It tells about wut she feels and how she lives. Part 2 was moses's life. I just didnt enjoy it that much
2,Really Not Very Engrossing,"I picked this up after reading Brad Geagley's novel on ancient Egypt [a light-hearted mystery] and and I couldn't be more disappointed. The writing is amateur and completely cliched in many parts, the protagonist spends an INORDINATE amount of time focused on her own breasts, and none of the book feels real or even exciting. Many books aimed at 9-12 year olds can be enjoyed by adults, but imo, this isn't one of them. I also was bored with all of the Hebrew words the author kept throwing in to make the book sound more authentic.Give this one a pass."
5,I too used to pray;,"But then my doctor told me of the latest studies that prove ""Praying causes cancer."" Now my head is clear and I enjoy learning new things. Life is good!"
3,Not what I expected...,"After seing several of the videos on UTube I like them enough to take a chance and send for the DVD, well most of the music, arengment and directing is great however the video part on the whole DVD is crap what a total let down."
4,Interesting read,"I am interested in life after death, although I am not certain about it. Never-the-less, this is an very interesting read, we'll researched and explained well. Gives you a good insight into the event."
3,HBCF 32,"The Hardy boys casefiles # 32 is quite enjoyable with tweakes along the road. with plot twists and betrayls that caught us compleatly off-gaurd, there is only one thing that i can say.WOW rox! cool! Exciting !...ok so that was more than one thing but..."
4,Best Sound While It Last,"These are the best strings I have tried so far...Saw a little bluegrass/country stuff and they produce the richest, fullest tone..I also like they way the feel..When noting they are very smooth and easy to play...I use medium gauge but I know some folks like Bobby Hicks prefer the heavy strings...Bad is they don't produce that vibrant ring and sound for long...Within a couple of weeks of playing that will diminish."
5,Enchanting,"In a time when flappers run wild, Julie Jones lives a quiet life on her father's farm, taking care of her younger siblings. Evan Johnson, the son of the town bully, has come back to Fertile, Missouri from the Great War, and his arrival heralds a season of change for the small farming community. The town's hired a new police officer who discovers that something sinister is going on in town, and a rich, helpless widow sets her sites on finding a man to take care of her...if Evan won't do it, then maybe Julie's father will. Evan spends his summer proving to the town he is nothing like his father. He doesn't look twice at the widow, his eyes are set on Julie. Together they find they can overcome any obstacle. Dorothy Garlock delivers an emotionally charged story of love and change. Change for a nation, change for a town...and change for a couple who was meant to be together."
5,Martina's music is 'So Magical',"If I had to sum up this album in one word it would be... PERFECTION!!! Just when you think she can't get any better, she puts out an album like this, and exceeds all expectations. This album is flawless. Every song on ""Martina"" is fantastic. There is so much soul and emotion put into this album, that you can't help but fall in love with this piece of work.It doesn't get much better than this!!! MARTINA is a must have!!!"
2,A great singer goes through the motions,"I've been a fan of Martina McBride and her huge, passionate voice since ""My Baby Loves Me"" and ""Independence Day"" (still her best song and performance), and she has become one of the most popular and bankable female singers in country music. So it's disappointing that she takes so few chances on her latest disc. Drawing on the current ""hot"" songwriters (Hillary Lindsey, Tommy Lee James, Tom Douglas) instead of gutsy past choices like Patty Griffin and Gretchen Peters, McBride's new record comes off more as contrived product than inspired music. Here's hoping she gets to a place commercially where she becomes interested in making some real music - hey Martina, how about a country take on a song by Joni Mitchell? Iris DeMent? Shawn Colvin? ""Without You"" from Rent?"
4,OK but not what we needed,"We thought the song ""In My Daughters Eyes"" was for a wedding.And its a pretty song but not at all for a wedding.Glad we kept looking because we found ""A Song For My Daughter"" from amazon.com and that song is perfect for our daughters wedding.mother and father of the bride"
2,Nothing to rave about here!,"A dig this band alot, True till death is great as is FFF but this release is lacking. It's not as brutal, it seems they tried to make it more old school hardcore-ish. Which is great if you like old school hardcore alot but me a want something in your face brutal with some furious breakdowns. This has more of a punk sort of hardcore feel to it but it still worth a listen, after all it is DBD."
3,Funny but head-scratching!,"While I enjoyed the first book better Scott Pilgrim is still funny stuff. I clearly am not the age group for this book, as I didn't get some of the references, but I still enjoyed it. The plot was a little too spacey as opposed to the more straight forward tale in the last book. No matter what, I'm curious as to how Scott deals with all these evil exes."
5,Great series!,I saw the movie and as soon as I did I had to buy the books. They are witty and fun and I enjoy them greatly!
5,"Worth buying, even a second time.","I own all of the Scott Pilgrim books, posters, and anything mildly related to the series (my name is Scott too..). I found myself conflicted when considering buying this; I wondered what difference color would make while reading this, but was reassured by a preview I viewed online. Color brings this already lively story to life, and actually gets one exited to re-read the novel, in short a long time fan or someone looking to get into the series will love this. From its bizarre mix of real life and video games, to the alluring indie rock scene of Toronto, and all the little quirks make the series worth rereading over and over. In time younger generations probably won't find it as appealing, but for anyone who can relate to coasting through life in a directionless manner, only to suddenly be faced with more than they ever have, this book is timeless. Needless to say, from my very subjective perspective, five stars easily."
1,Took a while to get here but was in great condition!,"It took a long time to get to our house, but when it got here it was in great condition!"
5,Nicely Done,"This is a very nice wrap up to this great series. I will not offer any spoilers, but needless to say you look at the characters in a different light at the end. Knives is growing up, Scott is becoming an evil ex himself, and what of Ramona? There are plenty of great reveals in this last volume (Young Neil and Gideon's powers being one.) This last book made me want to go back and re-read the entire series, which in my book makes this a great caper."
4,Or you could just watch the movie,"After seeing the movie, I thought I'd check out the Canadian manga (wait, what?) that it was based on. The movie did a great job in capturing the look and feel of the manga, and a lot of the movie's dialogue comes straight out of the book, although it's rearranged a bit. This volume chronicles Scott's fight against the Vegan Todd Ingram, played by Brandon Routh in the film. The art, hmmm. Well, the covers give you a good idea what the art is like (I suppose ""minimalist"" is the nicest way to put it.) But you don't get Scott Pilgrim for the art, you get it for the quirky humor and characters. Which, if you've already seen the movie, I suppose you don't really need the manga. I may pick up the last volume out of curiosity, just to see if the story ends the same way."
4,A True Epic of Epicness!,"Far be it from me to take a page from another review (except for that one time with the Gundam Wing show), but as Publisher's Weekly says, just this first volume of Bryan Lee O'Malley's comic seems to have all the ingredients for the perfect adolescent fantasy. Mindless action, video games, the internet; and slackers who rock 'n' roll all night, sleep every day, and eventually gets the girl. Is it just me or is there always snow in Scott's town year-round? Anyway, O'Malley's cartoonish art style is reminiscent of Biker Girl, a comic by Misako Rocks. But it really meshes well with the comic's fantasy themes and I look forward to experiencing the 'epicness' of the next volume.This comic is rated T for Teen: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations."
5,Amazing Books,"This is a great boxset. This series of books is wonderful, if you enjoyed the movie you will love the books. The movie was just an introduction to the Scott Pilgrim world. You should pick this up if you enjoy video games, anime, or anything along those lines."
5,"scott pilgrim vol. 1, precious little life","Big Scott Pilgrim fan - book was awesome! No big surprises in the story, can't wait to read the other books."
3,The lie,Don't listen to those who said this book proves everything about the Rape of Nanking. They had their own agendas (e.g. Soviet Union or CCP) and refused to listen to logic about what really happened. Read the fiction for yourself to make your opinion.
3,Japanese history,"This is a topic that must be handled gently. We are dealing with peoples emotions and emotions are delicate things. In all wars there are men on both sides who commit crimes. Only a fool would deny that.""The Good Man of Nanking"" is generating a lot of heat; that is why I think it is a good 2nd book to read if you're Japanese, not a good first book. I highly recommend the book (not the DVD) ""To End All Wars"" by Earnest Gordon. The book was written by a Scottish Army officer who was a prisoner in a Japanese POW camp. After you've read that book then I'd read ""The Good Man of Nanking"". Everything begins with a first step, including coming to terms with a controversial and sometimes uncomfortable past."
5,Another fun time with Maisy!,"My daughter loves it. She had just been to a farm on a school field trip, and she just loves reading about Maisy and her adventures!"
5,"also the best for dry, chapped lips!","I know that this product currently comes advertised as a product for breastfeeding mothers, but 20 years ago it was considered a much more versatile product, good for chapped lips, hands, and anything else that is very dry. I have chronic chapped lips, and Lanolin is the ONLY product that makes them heal correctly - without my becoming addicted to the cream (as they do with Blistex, Carmex, etc). But you should know that Lanolin feels icky and sticky when you put it on. You use it because it need it, not because you like the way it feels, smells, or tastes (though now, I've gotten used to it and even like it)."
4,Good Book,This Book it's a good start for somebody that is beginning in the world of machinist it's clear and an easy guide to somebody that give it's first step in machinist world and also a practice guidance for experience one's.
2,"Don't Bother, Even If You Own A Sherline","First off, if you aren't working on Sherline equipment, most of this won't be worth too much to you. It is really not much more than a ""how to manual"" for Sherline, which is a nice hobby equipment, but it works very differently from home or small commercial lathes and milling machines.Even is you do own Sherline, there are better books out there on the market covering basic machine shop practice. It is far too cursory in its discussions."
5,Great for begining machinists,I have very little machine shop background and have started building the Gingery lathe. This book gave me insight on lathe operation to help me understand the build process better. Great book with useful projects and a few charts for conversions and formulas.
3,You get what you pay for,"Cheaper than the ""real"" brands, and for good reason. Controls aren't great, sound is mediocre, and the FM reception is laughable. But it plays CDs, works OK and doesn't cost too much."
3,Good Deal for the Price,"This item is a good deal for the price. It's what I expected. The sound is decent, but if you want to hear good ""highs"" and ""lows"" this is not the unit that you want. There is no bass or treble control. Although is it stereo, you only get mid-range sound."
1,LOW QUALITY,"THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS UNIT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY...I HAD TO SEND IT BACK, AND GO THE GE UNIT INSTEAD"
1,under counter junk,Never could get good reception no matter where we placed this in the kitchen. Just last week the CD player quit working. It actually just spins and spins forever initializing the CD. Save your money and buy a different brand/model.
1,Poor Quaility - Do not buy,I bought this for my wife for christmas. It has a nice look and matched our kitchen. Installed it and it failed right away. It took several times just to play a CD. Then the CD draw got stuck. Then the right speaker failed. I returned and bought a better one.
4,aaah angry KMFDM the way it should be! (ie. NO tim skold),"I was impressed with this album more than I had expected to be. Some of the earlier reviews are strangely biased. Politics or not, KMFDM has always voiced their opinion. The sound of the recording is much better than previous KMFDM albums. Tim Skold is talented but does not belong with KMFDM and this album proves it. Blackball & WWIII are my favorite tracks on this one... probably yours too."
4,The kings and queen of sarcasm are back!,"Full of witty criticism and heavy dollops of dry humor, KMFDM are in their element. Musically, They have done better, but really what can you expect from a group that has no interest in changing their sound? Sometimes change is NOT a good thing. Personally, I am glad KMFDM keeps all their albums within groping distance, its something you can count on: like taxes in the spring. You will have to pay your taxes in the spring, and KMFDM's next album will sound remarkably like the one before it. But who cares? They still rock! Stand out tracks are WWIII, Stars and Stripes, and Intro.Fear and Loathing in Kentucky!"
3,It's OK.,"But I was kind of hoping for more. Sure this album has all the energy of past albums like nihil, and xtort, but it lacks the variety and creativity that really made those albums stand against the test of time.First off, some songs are quite catchy...there is no way to deny the fun of tracks like ""Blackball"" and ""Stars and Stripes."" Sadly, these tracks get old very fast. Others are just plain boring, like the title track and ""Jihad."" Overall, it seems very inconsistant and repetitive.Although this album is more focued then attak, it still shows that KMFDM have yet to prove that they reformed for a reason other then kicking dead horses. I suppose that there still is hope in there next album though, and I will eagerly await it."
4,Not too bad,"I have had my 'BIOPOD' for over a day now and it is working fine. The setup was easy on my XP laptop, and got it going in about 10-20 minutes. It is very small and lightweight, and gives a very accurate reading. The manual for it is very helpful, and shows pictures of most of the steps. The ecryption part works well. APC Customer Service however was not good at all, in my opinion. Overall it was an OK buy for the money, but it could have been better spent."
3,APC Biopod,"Hardware seems to be OK. However, it is shipped with a downllevel (3.50) version of the software which does not support Mozilla Firefox."
5,Phenomenal! Until I got Windows 7...,"Worked PERFECT all the way up to Windows XP! I love this thing! Then I upgraded to Windows 7 when I got a new computer. THIS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 7! I searched for an answer, but APC NO LONGER SUPPORTS this reader and Windows 7 says that the hardware itself is not compatible with it. :-("
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,The driver is very unstable and the softwae crashes on a regular basis. Save your money until APC clean up their act.
5,real war stories,"Caught In The Crossfire""Caught In the Crossfire contains two novels, Counting the Costs and The Warrior, two short stories, and a completely new novelette, arranged in an order that the author finds most satisfactory."" The contents are as follows:IntroductionThe WarriorCaught in the CrossfireThe Immovable ObjectCounting the CostsThe Interrogation TeamAs a Viet Nam Vet you can tell the writings of one who has been at the ""Sharp End""Highly recommended for fans of David Drake and of real war stories, not some made up by journalist types.Gunner May, 2008"
2,Not a very strong statement !,"I have been listening lately to a lot of wonderfull European pianist.....and I must say after listening to Joey new cd , I'm not impressed , kind of empty music , not very strong writing .Does not take you anywhere . The additional two guests did not realy add any kind of impact .For the positive note.....I did enjoy much more his previous cd Haiku ."
5,Great reading for all families,This is one of the best books i have ever read...and this comes from someone who has a mini ilbrary in her home...i would gladly give up all my books for this one...glad i found it. Please purchase and enjoy!
1,wasted money,"For my location in Larchmont NY, this product had no utility. Its function was poorer than a hunk of wire dangling across the floor."
2,Co-op TV,I purchased the antenna epecting to receve a better picture than my old cheap antenna. Since co-op living is different than living in a house many things come into play. The antenna did not work any better than my old cheap set of rabbit ears. I live 16 air miles from the basic transmit antennas. Chicago suburbs are not really the palce to use indoor antennas. The interference from other devices are amplified by the amplifier no matter how you filter the in coming signal and make the more expensive antenna just nicer looking but no better performance.
2,Effective but fragile.,"Worked well for about a month or so. Then they broke, one by one. Tried to find warranty people but it was an endless maze of disconnected phone numbers and ""not this department, try this phone number"". I'm pretty good at tracking down the right people, but after a whole afternoon of on a wild goose chase I gave up."
2,you have to learn the dragon fist to defeat the dragon gang,"This is a fun movie, just not good. With the music from Snake in the Eagle's Shadow beign majorly overused, it sets the theme for this weird movie. My favorite part about this flick was the zombie guy. The actor and drector do their best job to make this guy really scary and I thought they actually did a good job. I would have been a little frightened if I was a little kid. The final fight is stupid but still manages to be somewhat entertaining. I am sure you will love the airplane sound effects as much as I did."
4,Basic celestial navigation,"I've been sailing the coast of Portugal for a few years now, and have always been curious about celestial navigation. I dicided to buy this book because all experienced sailors i've met always talk about this kind of navigation. I read this book and got the hole picture. It's really very well written for biginners. If you are thinking about starting CN this is the right book for you."
2,What could have been explained in 50 pages...,"Grinhold and Kahn's concept of the Information Ratio being dependant on skill (i.e. the correlation between expected outperformance and real outperformance) and sqrt. breath (i.e. the number of securities a manager follows and the number of times he rebalances his portfolio) is theoretically excellent. However, in the real world these correlations and even breath are hard to measure and mostly propriatary to the manager. Yet G&K go on for 500 pages on quantitive techniques that might be interesting for those with a PhD in Risk Management.For the average (practical) person interested in portfolio management this book is way too academic, using some 10 Greek letters and Cov, Std per page (and I'm not even talking about the technical appendices), making it very hard to read and comprehend."
4,pointy but good,"well it was a bit painful to mount the dragon on the base (because it has pointy edges, but that odesn't stop me from saying that it is a good quality figurine (like all macfarlane's after all)"
4,A great book for when you feel sorry for yourself,I really liked this book as a great escape novel. It helps remind yourself that the grass is not alwqays greener on the other side of the fence. That and one must be careful for what you wish for.I rank this up with the novel Lest the Darkness Falls and a good rainy day book to read for pleasure and enlightenment.
2,Mundane and Humdrum,"A good concept but had very little substance.modern Lady lawyer went back in time to anciant Rome.Found herself in another body.Was suprised at the horrors of that time.Slavery,sanatary conditions,killings in the arena,lack of modern medecines ECT,ECT.She had to have known these things so why the suprise.After the first 150 mundane pages of a 500 page book we find ourselves reading about someones humdrum day by day life.By this time I started skimming over the pages trying to find something of interest.There was a epedemic where her daughter,mother and lover died.A friend died in child birth.She got in dutch with her family by setting her slave free.By page 300 I gave up on this one as a waste of time.There are a lot of better books out there for me to read."
1,A Book of Complaints,This is a book for women who blame men whenever they they don't get what they want. It's a surprise to learn that Harry Turtledove has so much male self-hate.
2,BIKER JOE WARREN CD,"The CD itself came in a timely manner, but you can tell its a burnt CD. The sound isnt very good, and the picture on the cover is a V-twin engine, and Biker Joe Warren died in the 80's... The V-Twin came out in 2002? Overall, I would not order from this company again."
4,Revolutionary Girl Utena-The Apocalypse Saga Delivers!,"The final four disc in the Utena storyline continue the unique tale of our hero Utena while further developing the other characters as well. While not containing some of the funnier moments embedded in The Black Rose Saga, the Apocalypse series focuses on bringing the viewer deeper into the history of Utena and it's deeply involved mythology. The story line can become a little confusing near the end but the series wraps up in a touching and ultimately satisfying end. The Apocalypse Saga will leave you glad for the experience and the best part, it will leave you wanting more of this excellent saga."
2,Adhesive sucks,"Bought these to put in a pair of shoes that slipped no matter how tight i tied them (just a bit too big I guess). I had high hopes, but the adhesive failed immediately. Within 5 steps the right side had come loose and stuck to my sock. I tried some special glue my mother in law had on hand and it did the trick of holding it on for a little while, until it came loose again. Wouldn't recommend the product."
1,Just Peachy,"With her overly perky attitude towards life, Peach Kelley is very popular, even if her own life lacks romance. She's too busy trying to make sure everyone else is happy to be concerned about that. Her latest effort is getting the officer nerd set up with a lady she is sure will make him happy. Unfortunately, he disappears under strange circumstances, and thus, Peach feels obligated to find out what happened. To accomplish this, she needs Adam Quinlan's help, as he has access to resources she lacks. Soon, they are up to their ears in the investigation and finding out two things; 1. something rotten is going on in their company, and 2. they are deeply attracted to each other against all logic.* If the plot had focused on either romance or a mystery, it might have worked. As it is, the ''suspense"" had a contrived feeling and the romance was shallow. However, Buster, the Bichon was a highly appealing character. *"
3,Razor V-17 Helmet,Helmet did not fit my 10 year old as product description indicated. It was too big even with the adjustment pads included. The helmet itself looks like good quality but would not buy something online that needs to be fitted again as this helmet will sit in the closet until my daughter can wear it.
5,Mom of 3,"The Helmet fits my 9 year old son great. Fortunately, I can't comment on how well it protects his head. Hopefully it won't ever be put to that test."
5,Takes me back,"I love astronaut food. Specifically the ice cream. It takes me back to when I was a kid and took a trip with my school to the Kennedy Space Center where I bought some astronaut ice cream. I saw this Sampler pack awhile back and decided to purchase it just for fun. I was not let down. I received a one ice cream sandwich pack, one neapolitan ice cream pack, one chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips pack and two space food sticks..one in chocolate and one in peanut butter. They are all exactly as described and I couldn't be happier. As for it being in pieces, frankly, I have never bought a freeze dried product that was NOT in pieces. It's fragile stuff and unless you are at the place where it was freeze dried, it's probably gonna be in pieces. No biggie for me. I think it's a neat little pack of space food."
5,Love this stuff,It has such a weird texture but it was awesome. I usually get this when I go the Museum of Natural History. I used it this time for a romantic date night under the stars.
3,True field guide.,"I'm usually hesitant to purchase book with 'cisco' on the cover because you can get all the info from cisco website but this book is an exception and it delivers.The author has covered all the aspects of cisco access lists, standard, dynamic, extended and reflexive etc in good detail and IOS config examples.Chapter 8 and beyond are bonus which cover TCP intercept, IPsec and encryption.All in all a reliable handy reference for implementing and understanding of cisco access lists."
4,"Cynical, rude, hillarious!!!","This is one of the better books turned out by today's society. It's a very frank and honest book about a boy's coming of age in the era of love. The book is witty and just downright, perverted really. If you like Catcher in the Rye, you'll love this updated version about dysfunctional families, and, well, sex."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This was a silly book. I am so tired to giving credence to ex-junkies who try to romanticize their twisted, and pathetic ways. If you want to read a great coming of age tale---try Franny and Zooey. This book is boring and trite. Stahl is a coward who blames cities and people on his dysfunction, when he should look inside himself."
2,kinda boring read,If you have never read philosophy then don't start here. It's only good if you are experienced in reading philosophy.
3,Creepy - would recommend for Teenagers,"I would recommend this more for Teenagers rather than younger children - it is creepy and a bit gory - but a story that flows well and keeps you turning the pages. Good turns and twists that keep one guessing until near the end.This one has less christianity then the other 3 books of the Cooper kids that I have read.I would recommend this book for non-christian teenagers as the best book to introduce the Cooper kids without being overwhelming with christianity. Not preachy at all.Still good for those who like christianity, and integrity.I would say that 'This Present Darkness' is much milder than this book in creepy, violent - more of a thriller type book but in a good way; will make good sense at the end. With an ending that I found better and more clear than any other of the Peretti books to date, for either children or adult."
1,AVOID ANY CYBERHOME PRODUCT!,"Company will not answer phone, website does notwork, Police raided them for unlicensed products.My unit died 2 days after Warranty expired.Product CANNOT be repaired.."
2,CYBERHOME DVDR IS ABSOLUTE JUNK,This unit I received had beenrepaired. Disc carriage door was more beat up than Joe Fraser in the THRILLA IN MANILLA boxing match. The unit funcltion controls often do not respond to the Cyberhome remote. I ordered a NEW UNIT as the advertising said some old and new..and I requested new for $ 129.00. I would never order anything from this seller ever again. I don't like being cheated. Recorded discs are low quality..similiiar to a third or forth generation copy VHS.product is: CYBERHOME CH-DVR 1530From: Vernon Tillman
2,Not the best quality,The material is very thin and there are lots of threads that hang from the stitching. It wasn't as nice as I had hoped. Plus I paid 18 for it before it was discounted!
2,dissappointed!,"Indian summer. Yes, this was about the only song on the cd that actually had that chris botti sound i am used to. It's not a disaster, but it could have been better. chris needs to stick to what he is used to. don't change because a lot of other jazz musicians are changing their style. the rest of his albums, until this one, i loved."
1,Get a Chuck Manigone CD instead.,"Botti is a Chet Baker wannabe. On stage with Sting you can't even hear him. Now with his own CD, it makes me reach for the real deal, Chet Baker CDs or better yet Chuck Manigone. Botti has such a dull sound and lacks expression. To this generation they don't know any better fooled by record company hype to put a pretty face on a CD cover. He comes out and talks to people in the audience, so they feel they know him and write a nice review. His playing sounds like he needs some meat in his diet too. The arrangements sound like he is totally afraid to give anyone else a chance to play. Check out Chuck Manigone's CDs, like Feels So Good, you will be glad you did!"
3,Avid reader of Sioux Indian related topics,Re-hash of events mentioned in other books on AIM or related to AIM. I would give a limited recommendation on this book.
4,fire clan series 4,"I was SO relieved when I saw that I didnt have to assempble anything-we all know macfarlane's has problems when it comes to that. As for the fire, thats the one i decided to leave behind for personal reasons-i think it looks better without it"
2,End on a high note!,"I looked forward to hearing this album for a long time. I love all prior albums, but I was so depressed after playing this one. The band has always had a lot to say and has always done it creatively, but this is just anger and hate - with no solutions and no hope. Maybe this is a reason why Daniel is no longer with The Flower Kings - his worldview and theirs completely clash. If you are new to PoS, start with The Perfect Element and buy this one last, if ever. If you are looking for upbeat progressive rock, buy Paradox Hotel by The Flower Kings.Musically, and I stress only musically, the first half has grown on me somewhat. The second half sounds like a bunch of B-sides - they are just not up to PoS standard. Enter Rain, the ""epic"", is just plain boring. If you are used to putting in a PoS CD and loving it start-to-finish, well, you might not with this one."
2,bad drama clothed in shabby eroticism,movie about 2 women trying to con a pro at seduction. Mediocre dialogue with same acting and plot. The eroticism is wooden and tepid. Shabby treatment even for a French movie. Yuck!
5,Terrific Instructional DVD,"After taking a 30 year break from practicing karate, I found this DVD invaluable in helping me relearn the Heian katas. This well-produced DVD goes well beyond a kata demo, providing excellent instruction by showing each kata in three different ways. The video is clear and the accompanying commentary is very helpful."
3,Gromit,"I bought this toy for my 3 1/2 year old son after watching the Wallace and Gromit movies with him. I've always been a fan of the movies myself, so I was thrilled when he liked them too. He loves to play with his Gromit figure while watching the movies. These figures are not very durable, however, and Gromit's head has fallen off multiple times.This is probably meant more for a collectible item instead of a toy, but my son does have fun with it; just have to keep the super glue around for when Gromit's head comes off!"
5,excellent reading for mothers and daughters,I bought this book for my daughter and we read it together. We loved it and had never met such wonderful characters as we met in Clement's Pond. I bought books for my daughter's girlfriends and they read it with their mothers. We all agreed that it was a wonderful book for children as well as adults. The girls are ages l2 to 14.I would recommend this book highly.
4,How I happened upon this magnificent story.,"My dad brought this book home from the library a couple of years ago, and told me to read it. At first I did not think I would like it, but once I started reading it I could not put it down! It was so intriguing, especially with all of the sneaking around that the kids did. I especially enjoyed the parts towards the end when you really find out what's going on."
2,"Good knowledge, poorly written","The author clearly has a great deal of knowledge and experience with golden's, but the book is extremely poorly written. The topics explored are very relevant and useful, but discussion was cosmetic at best. Nothing was ever described with enough detail to be useful. It felt like the author wrote the book over a weekend without putting any serious thought into what they wanted to discuss or convey."
1,Just another copy of Adobe User's Guide,"If take out all the words which have nothing to do with photoshop, the book will be 1/3, may be less.And since the author do not give you the sample files, so you can only listen to what he said without any testing...Buy it, waste money, read it, waste time."
1,Not for Newbies,"If you expect to sit down, read this book and learn how to create something all in the same sitting, FORGET ABOUT IT. This is a reference book...enough said!"
4,MOH vol 1,"I too came across this series by accident while I was mooching off a friend's Netflix account. Being a long time fan of horror series such as Tales from the Crypt, I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of Masters of Horror. Though your mileage may vary on each episode, and of course you probably have to be a horror fan to really appreciate the series.This disk contains three episodes, of which Cigarette Burns (directed by John Carpenter) stands out the most; it's story is quite ambitious for an hour long horror show.As far as the Blu-ray transfer goes I'm far from an expert. I watched it with a ps3 at 1080i and the picture looked crisp and clean. You get 4 commentaries on the disk (2 are for Cigarette Burns). I can't help wondering with the increased capacity of Blu-ray how many episodes and extras they could have really fit onto a single disk (taking into account that high resolution video takes up more space of course.)"
3,Misleading to include Philemon in Title,"If you are considering this to accompany study of Philemon, pass. The Philemon portion of this book is no more than a couple-page introduction with some brief notes. You will get more content on Philemon from a basic study Bible.This is truly on Colossians with a Philemon appendix. I cannot speak to the Colossians content as I have not read it, but am just offering a warning regarding Philemon."
3,While in the right mood you MIGHT like it,"Now pushing 40 and having seen the original in theaters and on VHS a bazillion times but never straight or sober, I find the humor dated and clunky but I still can't get too far from the film. It is really an acquired taste unless you enjoy scattered pseudo-intellectual cult films, but John Lithgow's performance is worth seeing all by itself.This edition looked and sounded great on our big screen and surround sound, and I even got my wife to watch it. Easy comparison: A less well produced and more weird 5th Element or a sci-fi version of Remo Williams. If you enjoyed either of those films you would probably love Buckaroo!"
1,Wow,I was bored and thought I'd look for a good movie I haven't seen. Wow look at all the great reviews I'll give it a shot. The worse movie I've ever seen! Seriously it drove my friends out of the house during movie marathon night. Finished it just to say I did. Only thing good about it is giving it to the most hated person in the office during the company party. Yup I'll buy for those I don't like in hopes they also waste their life's watching it.
1,what a BAAAAD surprise!,"I'm 28 years old and until yesterday, I've never seen this ""famous"" movie.Incredible, it's simply awful on every points, really hard to watch from debut to end; the only interesting element is the music, but unfortunately, most of tracks from the score are not present in the film or mixed at minimum volume!!That's all I can tell you, I think people who loves this moviemust be happy and smile everytime without know why!Tomorrow I will have to destroy this DVD with my car."
2,Largely a waste of 102 minutes,"I understand this is supposed to be funny, and I really wanted to enjoy it, but I did not. Perhaps it can be enjoyed through ""so-bad-it's-good""-colored glasses, but I just found it to be so-bad-it's-bad, without breaking that elusive barrier that propels horrendously lame movies into the realm of the hilariously awesome.There were a few mildly amusing bits, but on the whole, I feel ashamed that I actually spent 102 minutes of my life watching the entire movie."
1,Duped IS the word!!!,"Believe it or not, we watched this movie from beginning to end--just to see if there's ANY redeeming feature. What a waste of time! We've enjoyed all sorts of movies, from the serious to the ridiculous--but this movie is totally pointless. Pointless doesn't even begin to describe it. What a cheap piece of #%$&@%! If you have any appreciation for the art of movie-making, for a good story, for good acting, for provocative ideas, for a good laugh, or even for the sheer entertainment value of the ridiculous, don't spend any money on it. And please, if you have seen it, add your 2 cents here so that fewer people get duped."
5,No matter where you go...,I LOVE this movie! One of my all time favorites. If you like campy sci-fi then this movie is for you.
4,jdofthewest dvds,This is a fun filled scifi adventure. It is fun to see some favorite actors in more comical roles. Love the costumes and makeup.
4,"Fun, But Don't Expect Anyone Else to Get It","It's made in the 80's. It includes 80's music, 80's sci-fi visual effects, Rastafarian aliens... need I say more? The plot is simple. The character's are standard. In fact, it's mundane qualities are so mundane that they make the movie enjoyable. This movie relishes in it's ridiculousness all the while throwing in witty comments and jokes. And there's a watermelon. Don't expect groundbreaking performances or a plot that will make you think - this movie is about fun. So, ""laugh-a while you can-a monkey-boy."""
2,not realistic,"As a self-mutilator, this book is not realistic enough and I think very misleading for people who don't undersand self-injury. If you are ignorant to self-injury, than this book will give you the wrong impression of what it's like. It's not a mental illness all on its own as Steven Levenkron potrays it to be. You don't just get dizzy and decide to cut yourself. An interesting read on its own as a story, but not a source of information on self-injury for medical use!!!!"
1,One of the worst books on the market about self-injury,"I can't believe that the author is a doctor who treats patients who self-injure. He has his ""facts"" all wrong. If people are going to read this book for information about self-injury, I suggest they skip it and buy The Scarred Soul or A Bright Red Scream instead. The author's descriptions of the kindly doctor reminded me of Robert James Waller's works in which he has a lead male who obviously represents himself."
2,An exact copy of his earlier work,"I can hardly fathom that anyone who read the Best Little Girl in the World, could enjoy this book. The one-dimensional character of Katie is exactally like that of Kessa, and the plots are so similar that one would think that they are both the same story. I commend the author for attempting to bring a pressing problem for our youth under the spotlight, but with a character that hardly anyone can relate to (a thirteen-year-old champion ice skater and her over-bearing mother) it won't come as a surprise that the novel will not have the same effect as other books on the subject."
3,Interesting...,"I think that this book was a little overdramatic. The character 'Sandy Sherman' was obviously a self-insertion, which annoyed me greatly to start out with. The description of the therapist matched the small photograph of the author in the inside cover perfectly.The description of self-mutilaton was a bit off and had a melodramatic feel that made it seem a lot less real. Some of the more graphic parts seemed like almost replicas of sections in books such as ""Saint Jude"", ""Cut"", and ""Crosses""'.The friends that recommended this book to me cut themselves, so I was actually a bit inwardly glad that the book did not suggest any way to 'cut' other than with a pair of sissors. It does not take a genius to figure that one out. However, I feel that this book helped me personally, because now I have a vague of an idea about how my friends may be thinking and feeling, even if they aren't ice skaters or have abusive moms."
2,Just for collectors,"They don't add any meat here unfortunately, ""The Garden"" is a zero, and NO ONE has the right to cover ""For What it's Worth"", not even the Minds (and it's awful). That's a shame, a single should be a place to stretch out and try some new things, not just a technique to sell more CD's to fans. OK, this one has a picture of Charlie, and the other one has a picture of Jim, so . . ."
2,Item was incomplete,The 45 piece set did not include the hostess pieces as indicated. Hassle to return the entire set instead of getting hostess pieces sent.
4,Great!,"Several guests have complimented these utensils. Good weight, good size for medium size hands.Salad forks are perfect length for me (5'4""), but they may be too short for big hands (above 6ft)?Overall, I LOVE them. :)"
5,Great value,"I read lots of reviews before ordering this set by Ginkgo Lafayette. Many mentioned rust spots. I have not had any problem with rust but I have just had the set for about a month. I talked with owners of a B&B that have been using the set for two years and no problems. I think that if rust is an issue, you must look at your water quality..any salt in the water? Do you have a water softener or live by the ocean? I absolutely love the set and so does my husband. It is strong and hefty enough without being too heavy like some flatware. This set was a great value and the sender was very prompt. I would not think twice about reordering this set from this vender."
3,"I love this set, but it rusts!","I started using my set about a month ago, and unfortunately the pieces are starting to get rust spots! I have never had this problem with silverware, and I assume it is the 18/0 steel that causes the rust problem. I've never had to deal with this before. Regardless, I absolutely love everything else about this set - they are a good weight and size, the hammered handles are absolutely beautiful, and the serving set is a great bonus - which is why I gave it three stars instead of one. Be prepared to hand dry or use the heated dry cycle on your dishwasher."
2,Over Priced. Too thick!,I've been trying to find a nipple shield that's thinner than my Medela contact which costs only $6.99 at my local pharmacy. Ordered one as Ameda claims it as ulta-thin but it definitely feels thicker and poorer quality than the Medela contact that I have. I would not even want to try it. Why would it cost so much?
2,Didn't work for me,This nipple seemed too big for my daughter's mouth. She actually latched better without it even though I bought it in hopes that this would help her stay latched on. Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me but it seems to work for many other people so it's probably worth a try if you're having trouble with your newborn.
5,This is the commencement speech we should have heard.,"Mary Schmich's funny, wise, and oh-so-true faux commencement address is a joy to read over and over again, and a great gift for recent graduates or to folks just needing a lift. If you are old enough to appreciate the wisdom of her words, you'll nod your head and smile. If too young, listen to what she says, and trust all of us, wear sunscreen. You'll thank us later."
1,Selling out,"This is not really a book as much as it is a pristene example of the American dream of selling yourself out to make a few dollars. This ""book"" was originally a piece Mary Schmich wrote one day in her Chicago Tribune article. The article gained national attention when a prankster sent it out over the Internet, claiming that Kurt Vonnegut had written and delivered it as a graduation speech at MIT. Of course, this garnered vast amounts of press and publicity for Ms. Schmich, who is now cashing in the golden goose. If you haven't received the article via the e-mail scam, don't buy the book--save your money and get the stupid article off the Internet."
1,Too old to have any relevance,This book was published in 1994. The training industry has changed so significanly that the information in this book is of little use to anyone in the industry today. It certainly is not worth the price of $69.
4,really good,"i havnt listened to the entire CD but what i've listened to so far is enough to buy the cd. i love feels like today and bless the broken road. this is a really good cd, and if you like country music you should deffinitly buy this cd."
1,I wouldn't know because I can't hear it!,"I was really excited to get this CD today because I'm a HUGE fan and I wanted to play it in my room. I don't have CD player because I just use my computer all the time. The ""enhanced"" CD is so stupid because you have to register and do a whole bunch of stuff that doesn't even work if you don't allow cookies. What a pain...all I wanted to do was listen to the music! Buyers should be aware of this issue...they should have just made it a regular CD! IT SUCKS because now I can only listen in the car..."
4,Product just as it was described.,"I ordered this product to have something to throw in the bag for lunch for a snack. Amazon ships these well packed so that they don't get destroyed, in four boxes of twelve - four cookie packs (so 192 cookies for your). Each of the four boxes were the same you would find in a store like 7-11, so they also would be perfect for bake-sale/fundraiser/whatever type stuff. Not a whole lot more to say, if you like the product and you need a large amount, or want to use them over time, it's a pretty good deal. If not, look elsewhere!"
3,Silly,"This was a silly book/writing *yawn* if you're a hardcore ""ghost"" reader like I am and this book seems more for grade school then adults. I finished it only because I feel I have to once I start a book, but it put me to sleep several times and a book this size I should be NORMALLY able to scarf down and finis in a day, but it took me TWO WEEKS to finish this and forcing myself each and every time. Sad excuse for a ghost book."
4,OMENS AND CHANTS,"Another book in the Dr. Rhea Lynch series. There is a faith healer tent meeting in the pasture around Dawkins County SC. Patients are arriving at the Emergency Room with dillusions, seizures, and alot of Shortness of Breath (SOB). Rhea and her team are trying to uncover the cause of these symptoms. There is an auto accident outside the ER which carries a woman with one arm removed (she has it in a blood stained towel) and another delirious girl in the back of the van repeating a very strange chant. These two females figure into all that is coming."
5,Anyone should buy this,If you love the moffatts or wanna know more about them ...then this book you will definatly wanna buy... my daughter was very happy with it if you are fan this is a book to buy..
3,Fan fic fans buy this,This book is another run of the mill fan fic. I would recomend any Moffatt fan to buy it.... and not only that one but the whole series. It's a good book but it's short. If you're a Scott Moffatt fan definately buy it.
5,The Best Gummies,"I love to eat gummies. I find Jollie Rancher Gummies to be the best. Just the right size. Very distinct flavor. You can tell lemon from grape by the taste of each, not like the others where you basically go by the color. A great soft but solid consistency.My one complaint is I hardly ever find it in any store. I only hope they have not discontinued it."
4,"Nice, sturdy advent calendar.","This advent calendar is nice. We just recieved it a week ago and have begun to use it. The only thing i can complain about is i think the painted scene area of the calendar was a bit scuffed in shipping. We tried to use a few different cleaners to remove the ""scuffs"" and it hasn't worked. Not enough for us to return the calendar, it's still useable and looks great otherwise. Quality and sturdy, the doors open and close and don't seem ""cheap"" like other calendars i've seen in stores. The magnets are strong and the pieces are painted really nice. It's a great calendar we'll enjoy for years to come i'm sure!"
1,What a waste of time and money!,"Our book club chose this for our monthly selection. By the time I finished this book I felt that I had wasted alot of time and money on a piece of trash. I can't understand why anyone would find this book entertaining or slightly humorous. Then again, if you are into sado-masochism, lesbian stalking obsessions, ax murders, circus freaks, and on and on, then this is the book for you. I only finished it in hopes that it would get better. Sadly enough, it only got worse. Yuck!"
2,Too Twisted For Me,"This book was very grotesque and pretty unrealistic, yet it was facinating. I read the book pretty quickly because I wanted to know what was going to happen next, but I was grossed out by the events that took place! Luckily, I checked it out of the library, so I didn't waste my money. I would suggest doing the same."
4,Very dark comedy,"Well, this book held my attention... but probably for the wrong reasons. It wasn't especially well written, but did make me want to see what on Earth could happen next. This is very dark comedy... in other words, if you can't laugh at someone getting seriously hurt, then don't bother with this. I have to admit, I did laugh here and there... but was left a little disturbed after reading the entire book."
3,A crazy wild ride,"I couldn't put this down and I read it all in one day. So that is definitely a plus of the book. It was funny and fun and got under my skin. But the ending was a big disappointment and when I finally finished this, at 3 in the morning, I was annoyed. To Ellis' credit, I also couldn't fall asleep, there was so much noise in my head from these characters. But I think Ellis took it one step too far, as if she couldn't reign in all she had let loose over the course of the novel. And as a Southerner, I have to say that no, the South is not like this: this is wildly overblown satire, something I like about the book, but please, don't go assuming that if you come down here for a visit, you're going to find anyone close to these characters. For other good Southern reads, pick up anything by Lee Smith, The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis, and Tending to Virginia by Jill McCorkle."
2,Don't bother...,"The best I thing I can say about this book, is that IF I had borrowed it from a friend, I MIGHT not have been as disapointed. Unfortunately, it is one of the few books I have bought based on reading the back. Gotta love those ten dollar mistakes. Predictible. Stereotypical. I am amazed I made it all the way through and then kicked myself for even bothering."
1,Impossible to like,"It is hard to like a book when all of the characters are unlikeable, the writing is mundane, and there isn't a shred of humor in it. Helen Ellis is no Lisa Alther. I spared myself by quitting after four chapters but I still want that 20 minutes of my life back."
3,The most bizarre book I've ever read...,"This is truly an extraordinarily bizarre book, but somehow - in a weird, twisted way - I liked it. It was somewhat hard to follow, and (this is stressed) exceedingly weird, but it's recommended..."
3,"Read it in one night, but...","...that's not necessarily a good thing. It was almost too easy to read, because I didn't have to think very much with it. (Goes back to the previously mentioned lack of character development.) But at the same time, it kept me wanting to know what happened. I was surprised a little by the ending, but I'm pretty gullible when reading and do not anticipate plot twists very well.Did I mention that the characters were VERY stereotypical?All in all, I wish I'd borrowed instead of bought this book. But I will read another from the same author, hoping she'll mature as a writer."
1,Don't buy this book,"The book is useless unless the CD is working, but the CD has two major problems:1. It is missing all chapter demo files.2. The pdf files for bonus chapters can not be opened by PDF reader.How could a publisher be so irresponsible?"
1,trite and dreary,"I find it truly amazing that this book received so many positive reviews. The art is very good but by no means excellent. It comes across as a cartoonish and cliched portrayal of the Mexican landscape. The story is a dreary, condescending, and trite approach to its multicultural subject matter. A [copy] of the Classic poem ""The House that Jack Built"", its easy substitution of Mexican tools and terms, and repetitive, stilted phrases hardly render it a visionary poetic masterpiece. The verse becomes so bogged down in excess rhyming verbs, and empty descriptive words like 'beautiful' that the reading experience is like slogging through cow manure. That's before we attempt the smaller print on the right, which is as exciting an an encyclopedia excerpt, and a complete turn-off to children. As a pre-school teacher and mother of two young children, I found it was a grinding read that truly sapped my energy and put the kids to sleep..well before their bedtime."

2,Freaky,"I have one word for this book: freakyI didn't like this book, it was way to weird and creepy for my taste (and all of friends')."
3,hooks interesting book,"This is the one book that hooks has published that is genuinely interesting. It isn't a watershed of insights, but it does have some interesting pieces that provoke thought without her usual strident, oppressive tone, that tends to shut out discussion rather than encourage it. The book is not artfully written, but it is readable, and dips less into the usual repetition and redundancy of her other work."
1,These were not what I consider music,"I am an avid Country and Blues Fan. I wonder if anyone is still alive who enjoys this type of so called music. I found it irritating, not singing but screaming. Thank goodness for Todays Music"
5,Durable & flexible for easy use,"Got tired of using a jury rigged connection from my new Bosch orbital sander to my Rigid shop vac, so I bought this Bosch hose. Very happy with my choice. (You'll need to buy the separate Bosch sander hose adapter if you want to hook up a Bosch sander to a shop vac.) This Bosch hose is much more flexible than an typical vac hose and appears to be very durable with high quality construction in the hose & connectors at both ends (it is not typical thin, cheap plastic found in most shop vac hoses). The 15' length gives you more options when working on a project and means less time moving the workpiece or the shop vac around while your working. This hose plugged right in to my Rigid shop vac with no adapter required. For the record: It will not fit any of my small Makita tools--chop saw, planer, sander, etc. So it looks like I'm going to have to look for some sort of hose adapter for the Makita tools."
2,An opportunity missed,Recordings on a pedal harpsichord are all too rare which is a shame because it offers the possibility of a detailed and analytical rendering of works whose intricacies are so often lost in the density of an organ in an echoing church. The works are well chosen as well and this would have been a really exciting disc had it not been spoiled by Amrine's heavy handed technique.
2,One of the more boring play phones out there,"My son seems to like this phone okay. But compared to other play phones, it just doesn't measure up. The number buttons can't be pushed individually, it really just vibrates and makes a clicking noise, for the ""camera phone"" feature. There really isn't much else to this phone. And now ours is broken, after about a year. I had to remove the batteries, otherwise it just vibrates continuously. Very annoying. However, my son is very aggressive with his toys, he does tend to throw them on the ground. So I do think it is his fault that it is broken, nor the phone's. No big loss though, I didn't pay the price listed here on Amazon. I picked this toy up at a discount department store for under $6."
5,Excellent entry in a great series.,"This is an outstanding series, especially if you like fiction set in New York, and Winter and Night is one of the strongest entries in the series. Rozan creates an unlikely pair of partners - a Chinese-American twenty-something woman with a highly opinionated mother and four or five older brothers, and a middle-aged Caucasian loner. But the combination works. The plotting is crisp, the characters believable, and the scenes taking us deeper into Bill's past and feelings are especially moving. Definitely recommended."
4,A Legend Never Dies!!!,This is the DIC produced cartoon that ran in the 80's that was originaly part of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! There were only 13 episodes of this cartoon which aired every Friday and the mario cartoon ran monday-thursday! All in all a very good cartoon and well animated! Look for extras on this set because two discs are all that needed for the episodes! Now here are the episodes included:- The Ringer- Cold Spells- The White Knight- Kiss'N Tell- Sing for the Unicorn- That Sinking Feeling- Doppelganger- Underworld Connectons- Stinging a Stinger- A Hitch In The Works- Fairies In The Spring- The Missing Link- The Moblins are Revolting
1,"Excuuuuuuse me, Nintendo!","I can't imagine what Nintendo was smoking when they licensed their product to these people. Link's whiny,tough guy attitude alone makes this almost entirely unwatchable. Add to him brown hair, a semi-retarded fairy and a know it all princess and you have the exact opposite of everything we've come to love about this iconic video game series.I dare you to try and get through just one episode."
4,SKYNYRD still the best!,"A superb cd from one of America's greatest rock bands.The most underrated achievement in rock history is the job Johnny has done in filling the shoes of his late brother.This cd is a step up from Twenty as they all have grown together as writers.Traces of Blackfoot, Outlaws as well as classic Skynyrd.Still the best guitar band inthe world!"
5,Mizuno MVP Series Softball Glove,Excellent glove. This is the second Mizuno glove I've purchased and I love both of them.

4,fun book,"This is a fun sticker book for my daughter, but the pages for the stickers to go on are a little too small."
1,Taste like the real thing but dont eat it!!,"I ate maybe 10 pieces and felt fine for about an hour and after that i had a stomach ache, cramps, gas and diaheria for a whole night and half a day. I thought it was just me even though ive had it before and it was fine, so i took it to work and warned everyone that they taste great but dont eat more than one or two and the girl is now in such severe pain, i know its not just me so if you had it before and it doesnt bother you great but its not for me darn it why cant the candy manufactors have this quality of snack sugar free snack, without having stomach cramps and the runs from something that taste so good! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
2,Be Careful Here,"These have a good smell and a not so great flavor, at first. They are oddly addictive. I am use to Maltitol and its effects on the digestive track. These I must say, caught me a bit off guard. My 16 year old daughter ate almost a pack and she was ill for 2 days. (Im sure she wont appreciate me sharing this)She had severe stomach cramps and unstoppable diarrhea. I did not have any terribly bad symptoms. But I did have a bit of bloating.My other concern with this product is that the net carbs in one serving (6 pieces) is 11 grams. That is extremely high especially if you are diabetic or following a low-carb diet. Reference point: 1/2 of a Hershey bar is 10.5 net carbs. I think I would prefer the Hershey bar."
2,Not very sweet,"I purchased this product because I love regular twizzlers, I had tried sugar free red vines and thought they were very good so I figured the sugar free twizzlers would be even better. I was wrong, they didn't seem as sweet as the red vines. I was a little disappointed."
1,Didn't Work as Intended,I bought this so I could use my PS/2 keybord in USB adapter. I was running Windows XP system at the time. It didn't work. A total waste of money.
4,Worship Warrior,"The title is so true, once you begin to Worship, you come out ready to stand for truth."
3,Looking at the Dark Side,"This is a good program at looking at the dark side of human kind. There are a lot of gaps in every story, especially if you see it many times over. The storytellers and the performers are staged and there are so many gaps that can be seen, but does have some truth as per the perversions of human frailty."
1,Disappointed,I enjoy watching birds all year so I purchased this birdbath heater to keep the around during the winter. I was very disappointed to see it frozen over this morning. The birds have been trying to peck through the ice with no success. I will be returning it today.
3,Just OK,"We have a cast aluminum birdbath (probably the root of the problem). This little heater works well until about 20 degrees, then freezes up solid. So, back to chopping holes in the pond when it gets really cold. Looks like really innovative folks are finding ways to make it work, so here's to American ingenuity!"
2,Works well above 32 degrees,"I had such high hopes for this device, but it has failed me. I bought one for my father and one for myself last year. He used his last year and it did not work. I started using mine a week ago and it isn't doing the job in my shallow bird bath either. Bummer. My year warranty is up, otherwise I'd send it back."
5,Inexpensive and durable,"I have used my Farm Innovators birdbath de-icer for two seasons so far, and it works great! We put it out for the first freeze, then leave it there for the season, plugging it in when the freezes return. It survived all sorts of weather, as well as a time I took it out, hung it over the edge of the birdbath and forgot it for a week....plugged in and not in any water! I thought it would have burnt out, but no.....and it defrosted the ice in the birdbath just fine when we got our next freeze. The birds (and sometimes squirrels) just drink and drink.....probably the only liquid water for miles around!Highly recommended.....when this one does wear out, we'll buy another!"
2,Not useful...,"I bought this book and the Rough Guide to Vietnam. Thinking I didn't want to lug around both books, I left the Rough Guide at home and took this one. It seemed like it would be more useful given the proper Vietnamese writing of names/places and the more recent publication date. What a terrible mistake on my part. My traveling buddies had a boot-legged version of the Lonely Planet, which we relied on much more than this guide.This book lacks information about sites, accomodations and restaurants that was easily found in the Lonely Planet, and was much better described in the Rough Guide. For the places we stayed, the descriptions of the accomodations were sometimes not at all accurate. Maps were also better in the Lonely Planet.The only thing that was somewhat useful was the nightlife section, but even that was rather sparse in some areas.Overall, would recommend Rough Guide above this (far above this) and Lonely Planet."
3,"Justice, vengeance, madness and missed opportunities","I bought this movie because Beau Bridges is in it as well as the underappreciated Ron Leibman (still wait for his Kaz TV series to be transferred on Disc). They both have their share of the action. Bridges plays a judge who is ""soft"" on gangland crimes, Leibman is the husband of a victim, a survelliance systems specialist, who kidnaps the judge's wife in order to get things going. That's basically a good story, but it is not handled very well. Suspension of disbelieve is required more often than I am usually willing to conceed. The production values are good, though, and people who love Seattle will probably love this movie because their town is portrayed in different lights and from different angles, on the whole in a flattering way."
3,Mark Hummel's DVD,I thought it was OK. Parts of it were pretty good. He is obviously not a teacher!He's a better harp player than this instructional DVD!
1,Jaguar Mk1 & MK2 by Sparrow,"What a waste of money. Pictures and not even good for reference. If you are restoring a Mk 1 or Mk2 please do yourself a favor, save your money and time and buy any book by Nigel Thorley. He is the man, when it comes to the Mk1 & Mk2 cars from Jaguar.Thorley has the best books for reference on the Mk series (In my opinion) as I own almost every MK 1 & 2 book written.A good book to skim at the library not to own"
2,Oddly packaged,"First off, I think the lotion is just fine as far as lotions go. No big surprises, felt moisturizing without being too light or too heavy.The reason for my low review score was actually the packaging! When it came to me, it looked like it had been returned and repackaged. It even had some of the product on the outside of the container. The only reason I didn't return it was when I opened the jar, it made that ""pop"" sound when you open something for the first time that has been vacuumed packed. Seemed odd to me, but I liked the lotion so I just kept it. I would not, though, buy this product again. There are too many other options out there!"
2,Age Reversal Eye Cream Not creamy,I have purchased this eye cream many times; this one was not creamy it smelled like lard and had the consistancy of lard will not purchase again.
3,Keeps the area around my eyes feeling supple,"I have always liked products made by Desert Essence. I believe this company stands by what they sell and use ingredients that not only work, but are good for me and the environment. This product definitely leaves the area around my eyes feeling supple and moisturized all night, and the next morning it still feels and looks good. As far as seeing a big difference with small lines around my eyes, I do believe they have lessened in appearance. However, D E doesn't boast a big change with this cream, so don't expect lines to completely disappear."
2,"Great series, but come on...","I would give this show a 5, but come on 125 $ !! You can get the whole 26 episodes for 30 bucks, just look on other pages. I bought them there and they are great. The same with Hellsing, why pay hundreds while I bought them for 20 bucks ! I am sorry amazon, I am a great buyer but your Anime is way to expensive."
5,A Masterpiece,"Words cannot desribe Berserk. This series goes beyond simply being an exceptional anime it is one of the greatest stories ever told as far as I am concerned. I was deeply moved by this series. Do not pass it up. 100% entertaining, thought provoking and moving.WARNING: It has an insanely depressing ending/conclusion. Do not view if you can't handle unhappy endings because this one takes the cake. I have never seen an ending so excruciatingly painful and agonizing to watch because of the torture that the lead characters on forced to endure on such a surrealistic and epic scale. It would be hard not be disturbed by it."
2,Be Warned: NOT WIDESCREEN! Very Disappointed with MGM,"I agree with all of the reviews praising this terrific film. Unfortunately, I can only give 2 STARS to the DVD of this 5 STAR FILM because MGM chose NOT to present it in widescreen format. I can't really comment of the transfer because I only watched about 10 minutes being both annoyed and disappointed. Wake up, MGM! This is one film that deserves to be seen the way it was shown in theaters - WIDESCREEN. Very, very shabby treatment of a knockout movie."
4,"Taut, suspenseful movie","I just watched this again for the first time since it came out and it still gripped me.The first 30 minutes make you think you're watching a love story. Then, through a series of unfortunate and unforeseen events, the protagonist misses his date and ends up in front of a payphone at 4:00 AM trying to get in touch with his date when the phone suddenly rings. He answers it...... and all Hell breaks loose. This movie will keep your gut clemched and you're mind racing, trying to guess whether it's for real or just a horrible misunderstanding right up to the last minute of the film.Was it a joke phone call or the real thing?Is Landa insane or is she for real?I removed one star because of the ending. The film steamrolls from the answered call forward and then slams you into the brickwall of an ending rather than go around it. Some people like that type of ending. Done right, I do too. Not this one.Still, one very frightening movie. Highly recommended."
5,I love this movie...,"This film is one of those movies that you wish they'd convert to DVD! It forces you to become emotionally involved with the characters, from beginning to end, all while maintaining a well developed sense of irony. The side characters are interesting (there are many of them), and as far as pre-Apocalyptic 80's suspense films go, this one did a damn good job; it even has a little bit of hopeless romanticism tied in. The soundtrack is done by the Ambient group ""Tangerine Dream"", adding to the aura of sensitive excitement. Relatively realistic, playful at times, but ultimatly fast paced and scary, this is definitly a film to check out."
1,Miracle Mile,"Bombed(No pun intended) at the box office,not a very memorable movie except for the Anti-Nuke Crowd, and it's funny to see that then and more so now they were WRONG all along,It could have been written and made differently but like most movies it's got an agenda like it's followers, Reagan Was Right and you Losers were wrong all along, you want a good Oh Gosh the Sky is falling the world is ending Movie Try Red Dawn, that was more plausible than any zany scheme a liberal could hatch. I am truly disappointed in Edwards(Revenge of the Nerds) for being in this badly acted movie.We Won the Cold War,Get over it."
5,Need a 7 Star Rating,"This music has become the music that I compare all others to. The sound recording is what other music recordings should try to accomplish. The horn section is so tight that they sound like they are glued together, although each of them is strong enough to be a soloist. The Take 6 vocals add a wonderful vocal aspect. I can't wait to hear more Gordon Goodwin CDs. I hope that if he includes Johnny Mathis, the song will be a ""crooner"". I would also love to hear one song with New York Voices. Other recordings should strive to attain such great sound, production, and overall appeal!!! Please, Gordon Goodwin, make some more big bad music!!!"
2,"overpriced, incompatible with too many Oly & Panas cameras","I bought this thinking it was a mid priced version in the FL-36, (-40) -50line with similar TTL capabilities. My Oly C-2100UZ could not use TTL with it,then my Panasonic Lumixes DMC-FZ-10 and now -50 can't either, althoughthey, apparently can use the other two units with TTL.At the price (around $400 in about 2001) it should have been at least asTTL compatible as its stablemates. Pretty much only a thyristor autoand manual flash -- inexcusable when it links with the unique Olydata cable via OLY FL-BK01 Flash bracket..Make certain your specific camera is compatible; don't just guess thatit ought to or someone says it should."
2,Disappointed!!,"I am actually extremely disappointed in my purchase. I bought the fan to put in my daughter's room where there is no A/C. The fan on high is extremely weak, as stated in another review. The ice packs do not stay cool for long and even using ice cold water and the packs, you get about an hour of air that is a bit cooler than room temp. I find myself having to change the ice every hour but then I have to go to bed myself so when I get up in the morning, my daughter's room has been disgustingly hot and humid!!!! The machine itself is designed well, but every button you push beeps very loud which will wake a sleeping baby if you try to reset it while they're asleep. The water tray doesn't hold that much at all. I would've returned the machine if I hadn't thrown the boxes out already. Honestly, a regular standing fan cools better!!!"
3,Neat Little Cooler,"It's a not so small cooler; but seems to work just fine. It cycles through all three speeds for some reason and I will have to read the remainder of the instructions to see why. Be careful once you fill the little draw with water on the bottom; so you don't spill on the next refill.Otherwise it puts out a nice volume of air, it has a sleep mode that seems quieter than the Natural mode which appears nice.Should do fine in my Kitchen and bed side as I intend it to be.And for $69 it's a deal here in the Southwest"
1,Just an air cooler,"This worked ok for an air cooler the first couple of times then it had problems with the control panel and it wouldn't shut off. Kaito Electronics helped me get it back and credited me. Thank you. But I nearly spent the same in shipping (to and fro) for the product. It would've been cool if they paid for the shipping back to them. Oh well, it's just an air cooler people. Don't expect A/C like results. It'll cool a small area by maybe 5-10 degrees. Not much for me."
2,Needs work,"The problem w/ Marie Christine is that there is no lyricism. I can not think of one beautiful song that I came away from this album w/. There's never a chance to develop anything musically. Considering that the setting was moved to New Orleans, I expected something a little more lush. Audra McDonald is the only redeeming factor on this recording."
5,Great job!,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD with my 6 yr old who is really smart and seeing that she enjoyed watching it with her 1 yr old sister was killing two birds with one stone.I bought this to help my 1 yr old learn her colors,shapes, and counting. This is a winner and I am glad to have this in my media library."
3,"Sorry, haven't used it yet!","I'll start the New Year off soon, looks organized so I have to get moving on that! Like it tho."
1,terrible,"I am in the financial services industry and try to keep books on my shelf for clients to borrow. This one is going into the trash. It is extremely misleading for first time investors. I had to read a few sections twice to understand their point. I should have pitched it when I read ""There is no predictablility to the market; it is random.""One of the graphs seemed to advocate choosing low quality stocks over higher quality stocks, though if you happen to know anything about the very short time period during which this was charted, you might have known that the chart took place during an extreme bull market (where pretty much everything went up regardless of quality) After reading the section 3 times I think the authors were trying to make a point about valuation... I think. Not for a first time investor."
3,Cute Idea Not so Sturdy,"This picture frame is awesome... it's so cute. However when you grab it to pick it up, it seems like half of it will fall off."
4,Very Easy Read,"The first five chapters are basically a review of what any student would have learned in a basic intro to research course. After that, the chapters are brief and simply written making it easy for students to capture the essence of the material quite easily."
4,Basic,The textbook is basic and cover most assessments that a counselor may use or see during counseling. It provides basic details for most measures and that is its biggest weakness is that it is to basic. Most of the assessments I learned about in undergrad school. I was hoping for more meat and more detail when it came to the MMPI and other measures of psychopathology.
4,It was 10 years ago today......,"Some people might say it was when ""Soundgarden"" broke up, but I think the end of grunge happened 10 years ago today, the day ""Kurt Cobain"" died. I know not everone worships these guys, but nobody can deny the greatness of this band, and the influence they had on a generation. They were the ""Sex Pistols"" of the 90's, and exposed a new way of rocking to the masses. This collection isn't perfect, but what's here is all excellent music. Obviously it includes ""About A Girl"", ""Heart-Shaped Box"", and the infamous ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", but it also has the previously unreleased track ""You Know You're Right"". If you're a newcomer to the band, or don't have their 3 original albums, this is a good place to start. Thanks ""Kurt""."
4,Good.,"This CD is good. Has a lot of good songs. Most can be obtained by all the other CDs. The only 'real' reason to by this disc is for the first track, ""You Know You're Right."" Other than that... it's like a good Nirvana mix... all the aired/good songs on one conievent CD. This disc is a must have for any real Nirvana fan... or some one just starting out. Go buy it."
5,The sun is gone.,"Sure, this record isn't flawless - there's a lot of good stuff missing (""Polly"" and the In Utero version of ""All Apologies"" come to mind). But based on what actually *did* make the cut, how could I give it anything less than a perfect grade? Songs like ""Heart-Shaped Box"" and ""Dumb"" and ""Come As You Are"" sound every bit as beautiful and as URGENT as they did ten years ago, and the ""new"" song, while not a revelation, certainly holds it's own as well. I love Nirvana, and this little collection reminded me why. New fans - pick this up!"
3,A Waste,"If I was to review just the songs on the CD I'd give it 5 stars. Every song on here is awesome. But 14 songs? Come on, I don't want to dish out $15 for ONE new song! The Beatles put like 30 songs on one disc and Nirvana has barely half that. Where is Something in the Way, Polly, School, Drain You, or Dive? I really don't get it. If you can put thirty songs on a CD then do it. Don't waste your money if you already have all their other CDs. Just download You Know You're Right or something."
3,There's more to it than this . . .,"In truth, I give the band Nirvana five stars, as it is one of the most influential rock bands of the 90's. This is just one of the few bands back in the days that brought massive popularity to Alternative Rock. However, I have to give this CD three stars, just because there's more to Nirvana than just their hit singles. Of course, everyone's got to listen to the previously unreleased single ""You Know You're Right."" But then again, everyone's got to listen to almost all of the songs that Nirvana has released. Bleach, Nevermind, Insecticide, In Utero, and MTV Unplugged in New York are just right. I know times are tough right now, but if you're absolutely willing to go for it, go for all five albums that I've just mentioned instead of this compilation album that's featured on the top of this page. There's more than just ""The Man Who Sold the World,"" ""Heart Shaped Box,"" and ""In Bloom"". There's also ""Polly,"" ""Scentless Apprentice,"" ""Something in the Way,"" etc."
3,Should have been great,"I love Nirvana and some other alternative so I was excited to hear that they had a greatest hits album coming out. Most of album is great. A couple songs were mediocre b-sides, and should not have been included on this ablum. They screwed up something that should have been wonderful."
1,1 star for 1 song,what's the point? don't we all own all the nirvana albums already? haven't we owned them for over 10 years? why do we need to give courtney love our money for a greatest hits record? -all of the hits we can recite in our sleep. why do we need this convoluted marketing gimmick in out lives? we get one new song after all these years. i'm sure cobain is thrilled... if you spend money on this you are a dope.
1,WHY?,"Aside from the obvious kitsch factor, there's little to recommend here. Fans of Deborah Gibson or The Partridge Family might enjoy this -- everyone else should steer clear."
3,Not as Advertised,"What was listed was a 'used' disk, what came was someone's home copy on a CD-R disk of the original in a used case... It seems to play fine, so I will live with it, but not what I understood that I was ordering..."
1,It could have been better,"this cd i would recommend to the nirvana fan that wants to get into there music! i think this cd should have included alot more songs from the bleach album like ""love buzz, school, big cheese,"" but its just the hits its what the radio played as far as the unplugged tracks included in this cd are ok but they should have added other nirvana B-sides like the song ""sappy"" or marigold its just not what a real nirvana fan expects from a ""so called greatest hits album"" especially if it was under the coordination of courtney love its crap!!!"
5,Nirvana,"I like this CD for a two reasons. Remastered sound and unreleased tracks. People mistake the fact that nowhere on the package or inside does it say that it was a hits collection. Looking at the tracklist you will notice that the song selections were indeed radio hits and one would think that is the case. But actually, the soul reason for this compilation was that Courtney Love thought the song ""You Know You're Right"" was too good to put on the boxset to get lost with a bunch of poor sounding demos. She was right, because indeed it is now a hit in it's own right. It was also a chance to include the cancelled Scott Litt mix of the 1994 ""Pennyroyal Tea"" single that was planned shortly before Kurt's death. I do wish they'd have included the studio version of ""All Apologies"" but again, I can't complain because this was not intended to be a proper hits collection. Buy it even if only for ""You Know You're Right."" You won't regret it!!!"
5,The one last Important song from Kurt !,"I bought this album just for one song and that was ""You know ur right"". I was dieing to hear that song before i bought the album, and thats why i gave it a 5 star rating. But here's the problem. Only an hardcore and i mean hardcore fan would buy this album because of Kurt's last song. But other than that the album doesnt have much to offer. New fans might get something out of it. But i would recommened to buy the album ""Nevermind"" or ""In utero"" first."
5,"Not a true Nirvana album, but it's still great","This Greatest Hits album is great. It was great for me because it was the first Nirvana album I ever bought, and all the songs are great except for ""About a Girl."" This album wasn't just for money either despite what people may say, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl had been battling Courtney Love(...) for the rights to release this album with Nirvana's last recorded song ""You Know Your Right."" I don't reccomend this album to Nirvana fans with their albums already, but I do reccomend it to the newer Nirvana fans who just want to hear some great songs."
5,Kurt LIVES,"This is the greatest CD! I love Kurt Cobaine and his band's music really did change the world. I love how eclectic the CD is putting just the right balance and mixture of all their CDs in one not to mention the unreleased ""You Know Your Right."" I can't give but the best to this band whos name will live on forever!"
1,What's the point?,"As you may know, this is a ""greatest hits"" compilation. I think I speak for everyone when I ask this very reasonable question: what hits? Nirvana were an underground band that were banned from the mainstream for imitating superior bands like Puddle Of Mudd and putting naked babies on their covers (an act that would be illegal for most normal citizens, but somehow Nerdvana can get away with it). Anyway, how can you have any hits when your stuff doesn't get played anyway?I think the biggest insult is that the founders of grunge (Puddle Of Mudd) don't even get the respect they deserve, have had way more hits than Nudebabiesvana, and deserve a compilation piece such as this. Thank goodness POM is more popular than this imitation though."
2,Good if your new to Nirvana,"This CD is alright if you are just getting into Nirvana. Then again there are people out there who feel like Smells Like Teen Spirit is Nirvanas best song, so maybe this album is good for them. The truth of the matter is these are all songs you can find on other CD's. Except for ""You Know Your Right"", but there is a good reason for that not being on any of the CD's (Kurt Hated it!). This is essentially a plot for COurtney Love to make more money. Do not support this CD! Buy Bleach, In Utero, Incesticide or find some cool bootlegs. Dont wate your time with this one."
5,Important songs,"I would just like to follow up on the reviews that are complaining about what was included and what wasn't. If you read the inside of the album, you will understand these songs are important songs in the career of Nirvana. I look at the album as a tribute to Kurt Cobain. It's a great collection showing the variety and intensity of style in their music. Buy it. It's great!"
3,Not a good enough Collection,"A CD can hold about 74 minutes of audio, why can't they use up most of those minutes on this disc? Instead we get like say 50 minutes or so. Not good enough. A greatest hits CD needs to be filled up, especially if its Nirvana. And because this CD is short many greats were left out like Paper Cuts, Milk It, Negative Creep, Drain You, Polly, Dive, and how on earth could they leave out Aneurysm? Also, even if this greatest hits cd had Nirvana's 20 best songs, you are still missing out on a lot of excellent material. So I say buy Bleach, Incesticide, Nevermind, In Utero, MTV Unplugged in New York and in that order instead of getting this. It's best to get this album for collection purposes only. However the songs that were picked for the album were excellent except I never really liked Been A Son and Lithium much. So get the studio albums and the MTV Unplugged album first, well worth your money."
5,Classic and great!,"Nirvana's ""Nirvana"" is a greatest hit album with a new song, that has finnally had the chance to see the light of day. This album should serve as a starting point for anyone who loves good music and is looking to get into Nirvana. Nirvana still has the power and innovative style that made them famous."
3,An album that came up short,"I am a huge fan of Nirvana,and when I heard that they were going to release a best-of album,I got psyched.I didn`t care if ""You Know Your Right"" was the only new song,i was going to buy it.Well that was a mistake.I own all of Nirvana`s released material,so I wasn`t impressed to hear songs that have been played on the air over and over again.""You Know Your Right"" is a great song,but imagine if all of their previously unreleased material was on this album.This album could have been great,but now its just a starter album for people who have never listened to Nirvna`s music.Too bad for this band,because if they were around longer,they had the possibility of being the best band ever."
1,"""I'd rather be dead than to be cool"" Kurt Cobain","Ok, lets get one thing clear before I begin: I am a massive Nirvana fan. Ok. Now we have established that we can start on this. The music is timeless. However, it is the principle of this album which has aggravated me enough to convey my emotions upon paper. When i saw the track listing I was surprised at see the glaring omissions from this album. There are to many to go into to. Of course i appreciate that the album couldn't contain all the greats. This of course, defeats the object of a ""best of"" nirvana. You want the best of Nirvana you buy all the albums. . Now i ask you do you really think, if Kurt Cobain was alive today, he would appreciate this? Would he want this? Now i am not the one to answer this, but perhaps they are merely rhetorical questions. Nirvana were one of the greatest bands to grace the earth. A thing they were not, was sell-outs."
1,this is crap,"I am a fan of nirvana. I truly am. I own bleach, nevermind, incesticide, in utero, unplugged, and wishaka. I cant afford the box set though. But to call this album with only 14 songs a greatest hits is stupid and ridiculous. How can you even think of buying something of such horrible quality. Buy their albums on bmgmusicservice for a really good deal and then you will truly have a good collection of music."
2,Cheap quality,"For the price you would think these would be decent to good quality, I was shocked at the poor construction and cheapness of these. Great idea, poor execution."
5,"Must Have if you write! It's the lost scrolls of ""Elements of Style""","Writers need the rules of Strunk and White's ""Elements of Style"" but they also need the inspiration tools nicely stacked in the pages of ""Myth, Magic and Metaphor."" A great gift for the budding and seasoned artist."
3,Somewhat lackluster on its own,"Basically, if you don't have any Pokemon games for the DS, this game is unplayable. However, if you do, it provides a great alternative to the same old same old with giving your Pokemon a whole new dimension to battle in - THIRD dimension!! The star of this game is the WiFi battle mode, where those held items you give your Pokemon will not be consumed forever if used during battle. As nice as it is to see your Pokemon in CG rather than 2D sprite form, however, this game does tend to get somewhat lackluster pretty fast."
2,Could be better,"(Daughter writing review)I was honestly expecting this game to be better. I thought it would be like Colosseum or XD, and I was terribly wrong. There is a story mode to this game, but not to the extent of the Shadow Pokemon games. Really, the main goal on this game is to conquer the many colosseums this game has to offer. I didn't even know that until after I beat them all. I was excited for this game, and when I got it, I had fun. But since I didn't have any of the DS games at the time it was truly disappointing, and the game was basically useless. Except for looking at the pretty graphics and playing over Wi-Fi connection. But unless you have a DS game, you're going to get owned over Wi-Fi everytime.I'm hoping we can get a Shadow Pokemon game soon and nothing like this."
3,"Great graphics, not so great game.","If you've already invested in other Pokemon games, especially Pokemon Diamond or Pearl, you will have a better time with this game than if you haven't. There are no RPG elements in the game to strengthen your characters. You have to import characters from your old games in order to have most characters. If you do not have an old game, you have to use a predetermined set of Pokemon. Later you will get the option to get other pokemon from other trainers, but it still leaves much to be desired. Still the graphics look very impressive, and it can be a fun game for kids and long time pokemon fans alike."
2,Disappointing Wii Game,"Santa brought this Wii game for Christmas with the hopes that the two Pokemon fanatics in the house would be thoroughly entertained. Thanks Santa, but in this case, it was the thought that counted.The battles are just like the DS game -- you select one of 4 attacks to perform on your opponent and the game performs the move. You only use the Wii remote to choose the attack -- not to move, not to attack, only to point and click on an attack option. There is not even a vibration or sound that comes from the remote when attacking or being hit by an attack.We had hopes of battling such that one player could use the DS and the other the Wii. Unfortunately, upon reviewing the instructions in the manual, it appears you must have multiple DS units in order for the DS to be used in battles.The kids haven't played with Pokemon Battle Revolution much -- they prefer the Pokemon Diamond/Pearl on the DS."
4,Repetitive.,"This game is for true battlers. There is no story,all you do is battle. It's not like Colloseum or XD,it's more like Stadium. It can get repetitive,since you're just battling.But,it's still a good game for Pokemon fans. I wouldn't recommend it unless you own Diamond,Pearl,or Platinum,though.You can also get some cool Pokemon, like a surfing Pikachu."
2,Needs more action.,"Bought this game, but soon sold it on Ebay. There needs to be more action to this game-especially for a Wii game! You just sit in a chair and pick your battles. What a disappointment!"
5,Fun playing wireless,"Awesome game! It is great to be able to play with people around the world. If you like pokemons, that's the game. If you have a DS, it gets better!!"
3,"Similar dance, but there's a twist!","Those of you who are familiar with Stadium, Colosseum, and whatever the other one is called, its just about the same. The Pokemon animations from those old games have not changed, and neither has Gloom having eyes for that matter. New to the series (I believe) is the ability to customize your character in terms of how he/she looks, what they wear, and even their battle messages which in my opinion is pretty awesome. If your a huge fan of animals, which is basically saying a huge fan of Pokemon (like I am), then this game is a must. Especially if you trained a special team in Diamond/Pearl, because the game allows you to copy that team over to your Wii! I used to just love my team, now I freaking LOVE them! Not the best soundtrack, no story really, but the best and closest thing to a ""real"" Pokemon battle. Good for youngsters, pokemaniacs, and cool trainers alike."
3,My 8-year-old is a Pokemon fanatic,"Like I said, my daughter loves this game. My husband and I were not so impressed. We expected it to be more of a game involved, but it is really just battle after battle. You can't catch any new Pokemon and if we had a Nintendo DS, I think this would be a great tie-in. Since we don't, the gameplay definitely leaves a lot to be desired."
2,Don't bother if you don't have a DS,"We got this game for our son, without knowing too much about Pokemon. I enjoyed playing the game, but it is extremely limited if you do not have a DS or are not interested in playing online. EXTREMELY limited, as in there is no way to do much other than battle the same pokemon over and over. The rewards gained for winning cannot even be used."
3,The real fun is with a DS,"This game is only good if you have a developed team in pokemon Diamond or Pearl. If you dont you have to use rental passes. The rental passes have set pokemon, all level 50. That means only your opponents will be level 50. And in some arenas you dont even have to use the set pokemon.With Diamond or pearl, this game is awesome. The graphics are very good.You can choose any of your diamond/pearl pokemon to battle with.In this game you can customize a character, who you battle with. It is hard to get new items, and to get the points to buy them with. Personally, I pretty much stuck with the default."
3,Thorough introductory material,"As with many MLS students, this was the required test for my introductory course. I was dreading it based on some of the reviews I read here. I expected to tolerate the material and then quickly sell my book after the semester. Sure, not all of the material is exciting, but let's be realistic: it's a textbook! Rubin does a fine job of covering the foundations of librarianship. This is not a book to read for practical, how-to information. It is a foundations book ... one that covers the history, values, ethics, and policies of the profession. It also has an interesting chapter on how the profession is evolving. I agree with a previous reviewer's comments that the graphics were uninspiring. On the whole, though, the text is a fine, introductory resource, and one that I'll keep through my MLS program as a reference."
3,missing info. for add. background & ref.,"I read the book for couple of chapt. and got some ideas about the style of the book. It seems to be a detail explaination on EIGRP from deferent aspect.Unfortunally, the Web site author mentioned did not give anything which author said - links to other material related to EIGRP, solutions to selected exercises, etc,. That is not helpful for understanding the content of the book !Hope it will be fixed soon."
1,Useless,"Be aware - this item comes with an on/off switch and a green/red LED power/flood indicators and you can't tell that from the description or the picture. The instructions state to turn of the power when not in use to conserve battery usage. That's pretty much like putting a power switch on a smoke detector. You don't know when you need it, so you leave it on perpetually. I would suspect that most consumers would put this somewhere and just leave it for months on-end. Since there's no rating on battery life and I have no idea how long the battery is rated for, this product is essentially useless for monitoring flooding over time."
5,One of the Best C++ Books I Have Read,"C++ Coding Standards is one of the best books about C++ that I have read, although I feel the title can be somewhat misleading. When the average programmer thinks ""coding standard"", their mind probably thinks of a crusty old document on their company wiki somewhere that tells them exactly how to lay out their curly brackets. This book is not that at all, but rather an awesome collection of C++ wisdom that should be useful to anyone using the language. Sutter and Alexandrescu write in a wonderful conversational style that reading this book is almost like sitting down for a chat with these two masters of C++ and software development.I've learned a lot from this book, and it's a fantastic resource for C++ developers of all skill levels. Highly recommended!"
3,Disappointing,"I had high expectations about the fruit of the association of 2 authors that I appreciate but the result did not meet these expectations. Basically this book provides 101 rules or guidelines that you can get for free by looking at the table of content. Each of these rules is then followed by a very short explanation (1 or 2 pages usually). In my opinion, most of them are common wisdom that you can get from other sources. This is it. That is all you will get from this book. For that reason, I recommend to skip this one except if a convenient and compact collection of common knowledge is something that you are looking for."
1,Bad filter!,"I bought this tank for my children's 3 goldfish. It seemed to be doing okay until one of the goldfish got caught in the very strong filter. It died, so I cleaned out the tank, and put the filter back in thinking it was a freak accident. The next day, a second fish got stuck on the suction part of the filter as well and died. I finally took the filter out to help the last goldfish survive, but I have very disappointed children."
3,Interesting stuff with some lack of accuracy,"""Twilight Warriors"" lacks a logical structure and shows some deplorable mistakes. Well-told stories about actions of special forces around the world are interesting to read. But when I have to read, that the terrorist commando involved in the 1977 hijacking of a german Lufthansa-jet, ended by germany's GSG 9, consisted of two palestinians and two germans (in fact they were all four palestinians), I wonder, how accurate is the rest of the stories?"
1,2 months old and ripping out,I am disappointed. I bought a pair 2 months ago. They are already ripping out at one of the belt loops.
2,almost good,"The durability of this product is very good...That is, the leather is very sturdy, as is the workmanship of the sheath.However, we had two problems:1) This is supposed to be for a boning knife. But, the width of the blade sleeve is a width compatable to a hunting knife.2) It claims to hold a 5.5"" knife. But, the depth of the blade sleeve is only 4.75"", leaving .75"" of the knife exposed. This pretty much defeats the purpose of having the knife in a sheath, for a good bit of the knife is exposed, leaving room for injury."
3,Camelot?,Loved this movie when it originally came out. It is interesting to see how far film has come although performances by the greats are always a pleasure to see.
4,The Concert,"High quality movie perhaps based in real Brezhnev era event. The two main actors... The Maestro and Melissa Laurenti exceed expectations. Wonder how did she manage to play violin, not being a violinist herself. The story develops as expected, nevertheless is highly elaborated and credible. Wonder why it has not been announced in the Occidental market. A formidable movie by the Romanian director..."
3,US DVD version has radical and disfiguring cuts,"The rating is not of the movie but of the travesty this DVD makes of it. I saw this movie on a plane flight and couldn't wait to buy the DVD to share with my family. I am deeply disappointed in the inexplicable cuts made to almost all the scenes involving the ""King of Gas"" (played by Vlad Ivanov), which truncated both the comedy and the social commentary, as well as other small but idiotic cuts, which destroyed some of the nuances of the film. I am not sure what the point of mutilating the movie is; surely the complete film would fit on a DVD! Extremely disappointing and annoying."
3,Not the best engineering.,The shoe is cuter in the photo. I found the toe strap to be too close to the toes and thus less functional to keep the show ON your foot. Like any wedge it takes a different strategy for walking. The straps are a little on the stiff side and I had some trouble figuring out how to tie them in an elegant fashion.
4,Super Cute!!,Spent a long time looking for cute placemats which were large enough and sturdy enough to withstand toddlers. The flowers are so cute and colorful the kids love naming the colors and looking for the butterfly. Great buy!!!
3,horrible but I was in the mood just 4 that,All around horrible movie. Hey! sometimes you're bored but are in the mood for a horrible movie. This is it.
2,not reliable quality,"I guess I also got a defective torch! it takes 10-15 tries to get the torch to light, and the flame is hard to keep lit, when it does stay lit, I can't seem to get any sort of melting without lighting the sugar on fire and charing it. perhaps I'm using it wrong, but the directions are VERY vauge. the ramekins are great, but the torch...Do yourself a favor and do what the pros do, go down to your local hardware store and buy a butane torch. it'll run you about $10, and the fuel is included."
4,Easy Inspiration,This is my favorite chord book. I have been playing many years and find this concise and knowledgeable. I learned a lot in the first week of using the book and am able to add these chords sequences into my arrangements quickly.
2,Confusing...,"Well meant summary of the author's ideas on econ growth. However, I guess he tried deliberately to exclude any mathematical equations. But then he covers econometric models. How is that going to work? Some sentences sound like this: ""The XYZ factor is the coefficient of the product of the sums of the logarithms of the ABC inputs."" It forces the reader to try to decipher the language and to write down the equation himself. I put the book down after 4 chapters and will look for alternatives. I am a quantitatively trained derivatives trader who wanted to self-educate himself on economics, but not with hardcore econ textbooks. Obviously, this book was the wrong choice, and I will now look for a more technical version. It is a book for graduate economics students who know the equations already, and who want a (biased) summary of the current literature regarding these growth models."
1,this book is awful.,"By the time we got to ""people died in cruel ceremonies"" i knew this was NOT appropriate for my 3 year old even though it is written for kids around his age. Don't make the same mistake i did."
4,Another Western Digital Hard Drive,"I've been using Western Digital hard drives almost exclusivly for 15 years now. I have never had one fail one me. Lucky or just very good drives. That's not to say that if the drive is abused or over heated that it wouldn't fail. There's not a lot of drive brands to choose from. The two leading brands are both very good. But Of the 2 best, I think Western Digital has an edge."
5,Great Drive,"I have been looking to upgrade my hard drive for almost two years. I had a 30 gig hard drive which is tiny to todays standards. About a month ago, I bought and installed Western Digitals 320gig hard drive and never looked back. The hard drive was extremely easy to install and setup. It was the most painless upgrade I have ever done to my computer. Another plus is that it runs much cooler than my old Maxtor Hard drive. Great price, great hard drive."
2,1991-99 Ford Explorer Repair Manual,"In section 6 the information for the windshield wiper motor is not applicable to my 1996 explorer. Also, there is no information about how to remove / replace the windshield washer spray nozzles. Or how to remove the cowling along the base of the windshield."
1,Technically out of date,"At this point in time (2008), the only good things about this book are the chapters on producing and capturing video. The chapters on RealPix and SMIL are useless since most video streaming is done either with Flash Media Server (FMS), Windows Media Server (WMS) or Apple's Quicktime Streaming Server."
2,Not a lot of tech solutions.,"The book is detailed and well explained, but I hoped in somewhat more tecnical. There are examples but only descriptions (how to place the mic). It is very good to understand the principles but not tecnical solutions"
4,Can't be bad if it's Del Mccoury,"I purchased Cold Hard Facts because I am a HUGE Del Mccoury fan. This is a good CD, but I personally have others that I think are outstanding. If you like Mccoury music, you will also like this one."
3,An honest review from one of Del's biggest fans.,"This is a ""pretty good"" collection of music .. I'm one of Del McCoury's biggest fans and there are albums that will become ""Must Have"" classics before this .. Good but, not my favorite."
3,Too small,"I have been looking for a griddle to use on my induction cooktop. This one has slanted sides, which make it difficult to flip pancakes, and the surface area barely allows for 3 small pancakes. I will use it for a saute pan, but it's not really a great griddle."
2,Brilliant Solo Endeavor,"... had Josh released ""Burn"" alone without the 12 fillers.Scratch that, track shoulda' been saved for the inevitable Buck reunion ('Fifteen,' folks, they're back.), and this never happened. Like what they say 'bout Vegas.No hard feelings, JT."
3,"**ANIMATED! Realize this, and.......","I know, I deserve it for not reading carefully enough before purchasing, but I was so excited by the subject...That being said, it isn't bad, but leaves out a lot of things. I happened already to know about Judaism and Christianity, so I could fill in what was missing or neglected, but this could be dangerous and unfulfilling if I was trying to learn about them without previous knowledge (as in Islam; I have to take the word of the storyteller of this video here). I know about Judaism and Christianity, so I could fill in myself what was lacking in the video.This is good for children (I guess?) to teach them that different people worship in different ways, but to give a basic overview of world religions, I would not employ this as a teaching tool. It simply leaves out too many pieces of the puzzles for each of the religions."
3,Good but doesn't grab kids attention,"This was an interesting series. The animated shorts were interesting, and they did give a brief taste of the various religions (although very brief and superficial). However, they didn't really seem to grab our children's attention. I am not sure that the the fault of the DVD or our children!"
3,The Official Scrabble Word-Finder,"I purchased this book because I thought it would help me find words for Words with Friends, but the book is a little hard to manuever around. Difficult to figure out what all the pages are, there are no headings on the top of the columns to let you know what is being showed or how it can be useful in the searches for words."
2,"Okay - more clips, but less dialogue/music please","My kids, 3 and 5, enjoy a lot of the silly clips that they see on AFV and I purchased this set for them. Surprising to me, they have not shown great interest in these dvds. I think one of the issues is that the dvds include MUCH of the dialogue by the hosts, including the AFV theme music as they go to AND come back from commercial breaks. The music and dialogue combined contribute to the majority of time in these videos. In short, if you were to actually calculate the amount of time devoted to clips, it really doesn't amount to a whole lot more than you would catch in a typical episode on TV. I guess I/we expected to see a greater compilation of clips given the longevity of the show."
3,OK,"My daughter loves AFV so I bought Battle of the Best and Kids and Animals. Battle of the Best was much better. She watched it over and over, this one she watched only once."
4,A good selection of funny home videos,"It was very funny to watch this collection of selected videos, despite some of them are repeated from America's Funniest Home Video Volume 1. I advice to watch them in family."
5,America's Funniest Home Videos: Looks at Kids and Animals,"These videos are a lot of fun! I just wish it was a little longer. My nephew adores them, too! Thanks."
2,Iron quit working and customer service was HORRIBLE!!,"I have had this iron under a year, and it will not turn on. I contacted customer service since it has a one year warranty and the lady was very rude and condescending. Basically you have to pay to ship it to them for repairs and/or replacement and send them a check to ship it back to you. Which really with that costs you can just go buy a brand new freaking iron!!"
2,Jump the Shark,I've had a Shark for a few years now. It was good until the tank started leaking. Reading reviews I see others have made similar claims. Buyer beware.
4,So far so good,:Purchased about 1 month age. No problems as of yet. I like it.Item was received very promptly. Would recommend.
3,iron,"very nice, smooth handling only thing wrong is that the base is flimsy when put to rest it wobbles on the ironing board."
2,drip proof drips,It was super the first three times I used it. Then it started leaking on my clothes and board. It also had a scratch on the bottom when I took it out of the box. I would return it but haven't had the time yet.
1,DANGER! Just got injured from this product.,"In all honesty, this product worked great for around 2 years. For the most part, I was very happy with the iron. However, a few days ago I realized that it was auto shutting off by itself for no apparent reason. I accepted that this might be the end of the line for this iron, however I continued to use it, deciding that this was a minor annoyance that could be dealt with. I was finishing my ironing for the night when...BOOM! The iron ""popped"" and sparked emitting two giant sparks, one that landed on my arm. I know have a stinging burn on my arm. My first reflex was to warm potential customers of this product, the second is to contact the company. Please avoid this product at all costs! I am comforted to know that I am not the only one who had one of these products that caught fire."
4,Chyna Black,"This was a good book. It's the outline of so many young girls' lives. I like how she came out ok though. Love can make you do some crazy things, like take emotional abuse and lose yourself. I was happy that she figured that out before it was too late. It's a shame that some young girls don't even come out of that mentality. I would recommend this book to every one especially young girls who think they are grown and a man with allot of money is their key to happiness."
5,OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!,this book is one of the best books i ever read!!it keeps you in right from the first sentence.And with her dramactic decisions and upbrings it will have you talkin' to book;u should be able to relate.let's just say DON'T SLEEP ON CHYNA BLACK U'LL BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!
3,STRICTLY FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS...,"This book was made for the average girl in high school...I was hard to keep my attention, but I managed to finish."
4,Electric Company is Great ---but DVD's have defect!,"It was so great to show my kids what I grew up with. They loved The Electric Company. The New 4-DVD set however (at least mine) has a defect. Before each episode, Rita Moreno makes a few comments. After this segment, it should obviously go to the episode. But no. It skips the episode and goes to the next into w/ Rita Moreno. The only way I could get to the episode was to use the move ahead arrow on my remote while Rita is introducing the episode. Then it will advance to the episode. I also tried going to the menu screen and accessing the episode there. Same thing. It takes you to Rita, who is presenting the episode but then it passes the entire episode and takes you to Rita's next introduction. Obviously a programming glitch. You think they would have tested everything out before mass distribution. I love the Electric Company but am dismayed at this major ""glitch"" on the DVD's. I give Electric Company 5 stars, the DVD's 0 stars!"
5,Heyyyyyyyyyyyyy You Guys!!!!!,"I loved watching this show,My favorite was Letter Man,The Spider-man was creepy because he didn't talk. My favorite songs were Read a Little,Hey Diddle,Diddle,Stop!Tilt and The King Who Sings."
4,Radio Flyer Liberty Spring Horse,"I think this toy is a pretty good choice. We bought it for my 1 year old daughter and while it is too big for her at the moment (she can't reach the stirrups and at 21 lbs. is too light to make it bounce very much) I think it will last her well into the future.In terms of assembly, it took about an hour to put together and the directions were pretty clear. One thing to look out for is that most of the pieces are stuck in the body of the horse, but not all. There was a moment of concern when I had emptied the box and there was no hardware and half of the other parts missing. There is a note included that says to look inside the body for the parts, but the note is also inside the body making it of limited value.Overall, though, I'd say it looks like a solid, quality product and I would recommend it to other people."
5,We prefer this one to the other we own!,"We've had this for just over a year now. We also have another dramatized version called The Bible Experience (also in my reviews). We like the audio bible for several of the same reasons listed by previous reviews. You can go through the entire bible several times a year listening as opposed to once (on average) reading it. It does open new areas of perception that you can often miss while reading alone. Romans 10:17 ""Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ."" We enjoy listening as a family but we have also found that we enjoy playing it at bedtime. Which is one reason we prefer this version over the other one we own. The ESV or NASB is our preferred version for reading but the NIV is easier than the other versions for listening purposes. Between the two versions we own, this our go to version."
5,NIV Audio Bible Dramatized CD,These CDs are wonderful. The readers are exciting and enthusiastic. The music is great. These CDs are great for Bible study and even better when you need to hear the Word.
5,NIV Audio Bible Dramatized CD,"My husband, children and I have fully enjoyed this purchase. It's well read and easy on the listening ear."
3,Is it iPOD compatible?,"Hi, I have bought this CD but was not able to import it to my iPOD. Did I buy the wrong audio version? Can someone help explain? Thanks."
3,ok,product came quickly but discs were loose in their case and rattling around when delivered. Would have prefered better packaging.
4,An Irish Perspective,"The Bible stories are well narrated and the character voices are excellent. Goliath is especially convincing and God's voice is not overdramatised by excessive reverb. Though the NIV is as the name suggests a translation in International English, the pronunciations here are nauseatingly regional. There is no such word as ""urbal"" in IE and King David never confronted the ""Flisteens"". Moreover, large figures are read in a very confusing format. For example, Numbers 1:46 sounds more like a free-phone telephone number than a population count (600-3000-500-50). Otherwise great!"
4,Pretty Cool audio bible,"This item was a gift, so I'm not sure how it sounds. I did however do my research and found that many people liked the dramatic voice over. I needed it to be something that would catch the attention of the listener and not lull them to sleep, as the recipient drives quite alot. She was thrilled with it - planning on using it her first trip out. Loved the fact it was the WHOLE bible too."
5,Great for commuting!,"This audio Bible is a high quality recording. The readers are easy to listen to, and are not overly dramatic. Overall this is a very well done audio book and is great to listen to while commuting. This would also be a nice gift for persons with poor vision who are not able to read the Bible."
5,This CD fills up my heart,I have all of the Innocence Mission albums and each one has a slightly different flavor but there is one unifying element to all of them - they all fill up your heart with joy and the feeling of beauty in simplicity. It's rare to find a band that possesses such depth and clarity. And Karen's vocals and lovely melodies have such a quality of innocence which is refreshing in this day of slick commercial sex appeal and anguish in pop music. This album especially is an escape from this crazy world and a welcome one. It puts life into perspective and makes me want to pick up my guitar and write songs again - a truly inspiring album!
4,Still holds up today...,"A great look into the inside world of the political campaign. Redford plays a idealist with big ambitions, but little know how. (sound familiar?). As he inches his way higher up the holy grail of elected office, he finds his own morality slipping away. (with one of the great last lines in any movie). Redford has mentioned he might be interested in a sequel, I hope so, the dirty world of politics has only sunk deeper in a swamp of media shallowness.BTW - how about a new edition with commentary and proper aspect ratio."
3,Good for one viewing,"I got this video because I'd heard of it for years, and like Redford as an actor. It was fun to see during the 2012 elections. It wasn't good enough to keep, but fun to see once."
1,"Interesting idea, poorly realized","An interesting premise becomes an exercise in tedium, and I found my self constantly hitting the fast forward button. Everything goes on way too long; the characters get obnoxious very quickly, and the payoff is pathetic. I suppose for legal reasons, the name ""Microsoft"" is never mentioned, but that contributes to the film's failure to create any sense of reality: if Bill Gates really was assassinated, you'd think people from his corporation would be involved in investigating a coverup. But this doesn't happen, so it all seems pretty dumb. By the end, I was mad I threw away $15 and over an hour of my time on this very amatuerish production."
1,A novelty book not even worth its inexpensive price.,"A novelty book consisting merely of a list of silly vocabulary words. E.g., ""discard"" means ""this card."" There must be a better Ebonics book out there."
2,How to Write a Business Plan Sunday Times Creating Success,I returned this book to Amazon. I originally purchased it as a reference book but was not helpful.
5,Durable and Sturdy,"This holder is a great holder. It keeps your knife right where it needs to be, and won't break, no matter how much where and tear you give it. Awesome!"
3,Finally complete but would have preferred remastered versions.,"Complete yes, but mastered from broadcast tapes. If this is the only way to get it now, then so be it."
4,Very useful for the techy student,"my son got this book to assist in his Comp Sci studies, and he is now very happy with this textbook"
5,Great help!,"This book has helped me draw with my kids. My 6yo girl was always asking me to draw with her, but I didn't know how to draw decent looking animals. Easy to follow and produces great results"
5,Good product--American made,This product was labelled as being from Ace Hardware. It was good quality and American-made. Very reasonably priced. Nicer unit than the original it replaced.
4,It's a Beast!,"I wanted a catch all type of camera bag that I could use to cut down on the amt. of bags when traveling. This is really really big as far as size-compared to what i'm used to. I was able to put my Canon Rebel XT w/ 17-55mm lens in it along w/ a macro & telephone lens & hoods plus all the cables, cards, etc. I originally got the bag for the additional computer compartment -it's a little tight but it fits. if you don't mind the ""bulk"" of this bag it's good. The top section holds my underwater camera & external flash & extra gear for that. It seems like no matter what i throw in this thing i still have room. on the down side, the zipper around the camera section only has one zip = it isn't a 2way zipper so that's burdensome. the bottom slides out like a cooler. weird. bottom line, it holds everything, it's studry & it's big."
5,Great bag but doesn't solve all problems,"I wanted a bag that would let me carry my camera stuff, computer and a few things, like a book, magazine and jacket, all in the same place when traveling. This bag does that well. Very comfortable.However, it's too big to carry around when sightseeing once I get to my destination. So, what I did was get the Slingshot 200 as well. That holds all my camera stuff (DSLR, three lenses, flash, mini tripod, cables, small point and shoot, video camera). I took the camera insert out of the Compurover, and the Slingshot fits inside of the Compurover. When I get to where I'm going, I can take the Slingshot out and carry that around. This works pretty well. You could probably do the same with a less expensive backback than the Compurover, but the computer pocket with the side access is a nice feature."
5,"great product, great price!","I have 14 month old twins and have the English version of this toy, Baby Tad. I bought this because it was such a bargain and because I'm a Spanish teacher and would like to expose my babies to more Spanish. It has great music and fun information. I wish it came with a song book of words to the traditional childrens' songs it has as I've never heard them before! My babies love the lights and songs!"
3,Um.,"Kinda facile, isn't it? I mean, I like groovy, twee space-out music, too, but I guess I go more for David Kilgour, or even the Beta Band. Not to begrudge those who are having fun listening to this disc, but it didn't do much for me."
4,eels bassist gone good,"this is the first solo project from former eels, tommy walter. Being a big eels fan I have been waiting for this one for some time. The wait was worth it. While it is not a ground breaking record, it is an excellent one. In particular the song Ruin Your Life is great. Don't expect it to sound like the eels. Tommy has his own sound that is more like Failure or Smashing Pumkins."
5,The best cd of 2002,Abandoned Pools Cd- Humanistic is undoubtedly the best Cd of 2002. All of the songs that are on it are fabulous. The beats are good to either chill to or rock out to. It truly deserves the 5 star rating that I gave it. So if you are on the ledge thinking of buying it- buy it!!!! You wont regret it!!
4,Nice Band!!!,"As I know Abandoned Pools is a band of YOSHIKI's records , I buy it without thinking . After I listened their music ,I think it's a nice band! Good music!"
4,The real @#$%...,"I like the aggressive, but still relaxing vibe of the album... if that makes any sense. The lyrics go really deep, which is something that is rare in the current ankle-shallow music scene. It's like Pink Floyd in that sense, and I think that's very admirable & risktaking. I'm psyched when an album makes me think & feel, so Abandoned Pools get my full-on approval."
5,cool beans!!,"Abandoned Pools CD ""Humanistic"" is an awesome CD! the songs have so much meaning to them and the music is the best. when things like that are mixed together they create the perfect CD. BUY IT!!!!"
5,watch band!,"It's a very nice watch band and the quality of it is great. You can hardly find a good watch band this day and age,because everything is made so cheaply.It is almost like buying everything that's disposable and that's the sad thing.Whats needed is too bring back the good quality workmanship too the good ole USA......"
1,i would not buy this product again,"This product is not what I was looking for.the selling point was that it had two video outputs.what they don't tell you is that they are seperate component outputs.pluschannel 1,2,3 only go to one outputmaking that part of my selector useless. i don't have hdmi tv'sthat leaves only channel 4, 5 for composite video output.i'm glad this was on sale. I would have been pissed if I paid$150.00 for this junkI was looking for a five channel a/v switch.i paid for a two channel :("
2,Tricky video outputs,"The video outputs used with my vcr's is grainy, black and white.Updated review:I am using the other outputs now and I have color and a quality picture. Always try different outputs."
5,Joyride!,"Wow, this is a great portrait, you can tell the filmmaker really loves Wesley. It's funny, sad scary, disturbing and loving. What a guy! Fascinating whether you know Wesley's music or not."
5,An everything endocrinology review,This bastion of clinical vignettes is a must for any clinician who yearns for complete knowlege of endocrine medicine. Its dynamic writing style turns this educational treasure into a page turner. I only hope the author plans to leave subsequent marks on the world of medical education.
3,not the best thatcher on acid cd,"this collects songs from all of thatcher on acid's lps (Curdled/Moondance/Frank/Yurp Thing/Garlic) along with some singles, comp, and live tracks. there are some real high points here and one gets a sense of the band's development from moody anarcho-punks, to the more pop-punk phase, to the artsier drippy late releases (Chagrin, Yo Yo Man etc), but this is certainly not the definitive thatcher on acid cd. i would recommend Thatcher on Acid's ""Frank"" or ""Moondance"" before suggesting this. Still, if you like thatcher on acid, this cd satiates one's appetite and negates the need to scrounge about for some of TonA's rarer tracks.one side note: amazon.com lists this as being by Thatcher on Acid/Wat Tyler. While Thatcher on Acid share one member with Wat Tyler, this is definitely not a Wat Tyler cd--they have it confused with the Thatcher on Acid/Wat Tyler split, ""Yurp Thing/Margarine Walker."""
2,"Buyer Beware, Edited DVD!","Not what I expected it to be on DVD--several scenes were edited out, such as the prison guard rape scene and also the best scene in which one of the ""baddies"" gets impaled in the neck with a grappling hook in a bathroom stall. The remainder of the film is intact, language and all, but it's a mystery why the other scenes edited out. Perhaps being a foreign Region 2 disc? Who knows. Your best bet is to avoid this and get the long out of print but unedited VHS version. An item of note on the subject of editing, watch closely on many of the prison cell scenes and you'll see the dialogue microphone dangling down near the top of the screen from time to time--how could that have gone unnoticed from the director on down? I think it's hilarious, but it's just a clue as to the kind of movie you're in for here."
5,Chained Heat VHS Version,"I bought this movie at a yard sale many, many years ago, has been one of my favorites ever since. Not that I am into prison type movies, but, I had to get this movie just because Linda Blair was starring in the movie. Although this movie aired a long time ago, when I watched it, Linda Blair looked so good then and I bet she is still looking good! What a Total Babe, she has it all, The 3 B's, Beauty, Body, and Brains. I still watch this movie after all these years, and just don't get tired of it. I mean, who could get tired of Linda Blair! There were many fine actresses in the film, but Linda Blair was the star as far as I am concerned."
3,Anime in the U.S.A.,"Terrence Walker, creator of the Tokyo Pop comic World Of Hartz, originally started out doing his own independent anime-styled animation. This collects his short feature, Understanding Chaos, which is like Armitage III meets Total Recal, and the first episode of his series, Shadowskin, about a fugitive in a cybersuit who is on the run from an evil orginization. The DVD also tells a little about how he creates each feature. The animation is a little basic compared to even some other indpendent CGI animation, but still available at an affordable price."
3,Retroactive,"Very, very average. The 80's New Wave/Post-Punk movement comparisons are undeniable, but at least it's somewhat better than Snow Patrol's ""Final Straw""...an album that's also plagued with many influences all wrapped together.Like with said album, it's not bad, per se, it's just dated and not in a fun, retro good way. With ""Stellastarr*,"" I can't see the dug-up 80's re-movement going much further.Key tracks: ""In the Walls"" and ""Jenny"""
2,David Byrne meets Goat Boy,"Average musicianship, derivative, reminds me of some of the early 90's late 80's ""art bands"", only a ""color by number version""...some catchy melodies, unsophisticated, attractive musicians should play well on video (especially the bass player, but don't let her sing without pitch correction!). It gets better the more you hear it. They might make a go of it with insightful management."
5,A GREAT DISCOVERY!,"With a sound that is a wonderful mix of The Cure, Talking Heads, The New Pornographers, and The Killers, this has been a great cd that I am excited to have come across! Although Stellastarr's sound can be compared to some amazing favorites, they still are able to create music and some amazing lyrics that are completely original to the band. My Coco quickly becomes a radio-friendly favorite, but I am in love with all the songs. Another personal favorite is Somewhere Across Forever, a song that begins with a bang and has creative lyrics like, ""We could run away from ourselves if we knew who we were!"" Give Stellastarr a try and I hope you find their songs as much of a muscically stimulating treat as I did."
1,Interpol Already?,"Isn't it premature for Interpol-influenced bands? I'm certain they'd hate the comparison, but Stellastarr* draw from the same pool of influences. Yet where Paul Banks' affect-less vocal style adds tension to Interpol's gothic reminiscences, Shawn Christensen's preening vocals come across as three types of pompous. Amanda Tannen's wispy sweet background vocals add color to the drab surroundings, particularly on the nearly bearable ""Somewhere Across Forever"". After that, it's hiccupping sub-par David Byrne strangulations and dreadful lyrics (my favorite is when Christensen says he wants to blame his bad breakup ""on the artist in me"" - yeah right!). And what's with that damn asterisk in the band name? Was a perky little heart trademarked?"
3,Short on inst,"It could have been a little more complete on how-tos. Picture are to old, the information was geared to much to it was done in years gone by."
2,Super Reader,"This starts off ok, as Torr and Tara Vorkun are just trying to get along, and get a chicken.Trouble soon overtakes them, and she has her boots on. This is a problem, as her witchery only works when she is naked. Luckily Torr's magic flaming sword works ok, clad or otherwise.They run into wizards, bird girls, arrogant warriors, and some problems with the Black Bodice."
1,Not in English!,"If you want to read something by Newton, get the Principia. Whoever translated this book did a horrible job."
1,Not Vista Ready,They do not have a Vista driver yet. No ETA on its availability either. Do not buy this model if you have Vista OS.
1,-an adequate performance marred by technical flaws.,"The potential buyer should know (from the liner notes) that the Berlioz was recorded in mono from an FM broadcast and that the Mendelssohn was recorded in mono from LPs. Unfortunately, neither source was up to it's technical limits. The dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratios both suffer from this treatment and the Mendelssohn suffers additionally from snap, crackle and pop. If you are interested in performances by Bruno Walter, you may wish to add this recording to your collection. If your primary interest is low cost (music students and such), there are numerous other recordings in this price range that will better fit your needs."
1,"Bad, Horrible Book","This book talks about anything but body language. It says things that would not attract women. The techniques the author ""explains"" would not attract women. In fact, you would never get to meet a woman that way. Do not buy this book. It is Awful."
3,SOUTHERN HIP-HOP AT ITS BEST,"i just wanted to say that these guys have won a fan in me, being that these guys were from the south (florida in particular) i must admit i went into this cd thinking i would find the overkill usage of ""bling bling"" style lyrics and the flashy balling materialistic rhymes, but these guys have something refreshing to bring to the table. from the bouncy ""U SHOULDA WAITED"" to the b-boyish battle rhymes of ""HERE THEY COME"" and ""SD's N THA HOUSE"" to my personal favorite ""DREAMZ"".and the music is consistent to keep your head bobbin'. these guys have shown the ablility to be trendsetters and not trend-followers, keep an eye out for these guys, i expect to see alot of great things in the future."
5,Hello Kitty in The Movies,"I really like this DVD player. It's so cute. It matches my tv and I love how it sits upright, it works great. I wasn't sure what to rate educational value? I guess it really depends on what you watch!"
3,Does not fit all,"The description states this fits 1997 and after, which is not correct. I bought this part locally because of this same info on the box at the store. As another reviewer stated, it is to small for my newer 2009 model mower. The style is the same, but the shaft size on my engine is larger. The correct part number for my mower is kit number 753-06304. This is an MTD part number and fits many newer mowers including my Troy Built. As with this kit, it includes all three parts."
3,Smoking Smokie,"Greetings Fans!This was an on time project, get the CD.....I rate it 3 of 5 simply because it was not all original songs from scratch.Ray Rambo Rapu"
4,For women that want to get more out of masturbating.,"This woman tells her story of masturbating andhow it correlates with the sex she has with herhusband. This DVD is different than the othermasturbation video that I have seen,as it includes a personal interview by thewoman that tells the viewer what she feels in herbody when she's doing the actual masturbation.There is also a lengthy demonstration of hermasturbating, with close camera shots of themethod she is using to bring about orgasm. Itried the approach she describes and uses, andfind it to be a nice way to treat myself.I even notice a difference inhow my body feels when I get into bed with my partner too!Great video for women that want to get more out of masturbating."
3,Proceed with caution...,"SOME SPOILERSThis beautifully shot film centers on a small fishing facility, it's owner and a fisherman--both characters are very disturbed and by the conclusion have bonded in an unusual, altogether unpleasant way. There is very little dialogue and the acting, especially by the leads, is quite good.More disturbing than the heralded swallowing of fishhooks sequence is the actual violence enacted towards live fish. Was it necessary? Not really but the film is worth seeing anyway."
3,Could've been better,This video was more or less a compilation of the three series set of XPW Television shows. This DVD was leading people to think that this was a documentary about the company Xtreme Pro Wrestling. It wasn't. This was basically a teaser trailer/demo video for the three set series of Television tapings.
2,A pretty big let down.,"First and foremost, anyone who says XPW is better than ECW is nuts. If ECW was low budget, XPW is backyard wrestling, the video is sometimes too bright, too dark, there is only commentary with no noise, or only noise without commentary, the camera angles are terrible and the commentators are OK at best. Larry Rivera aka Pat Hoed is the most horrific commentator ever, with broken English rants and lot's of the word ""chico"" thrown in... he is horrid. The matches go from low rent and bad to decent on occasion but I was led to believe this was an ECW alumni show because XPW picked up most of their guys when ECW folded. I would assume some of the matches are that, but most of them are missing something and nothing can re-capture ECW. Sadly XPW has yet to impress with any of it's dvds."
2,Flimsy sheet of plastic instead of glass,"The frame itself is decent, but the figures don't look as nice as the ones in the picture. However, the worst thing about this frame is the window to display your picture. Instead of glass or even a thick clear piece of plastic, it's just a cheap and flimsy plastic sheet. It's so cheap that it is warped. I would not recommend buying this frame."
4,There is always Bjoerling,"That potboiler <Tosca> does continue to attract stars to the stage and to the recording studio and one of the most popular entries on LP was the 1956 RCA Victor version with Leinsdorf at the helm and Zinka Milanov (Tosca), Jussi Bjoerling (Cavaradossi), and Leonard Warren (Scarpia). As with so many other opera recordings, this is strictly for fans of the stars. Bjoerling's voice is such a delight to hear, but not for a moment does he convince as an ardent revolutionary. Milanov has sounded better in the past, Warren more focused vocally. Also with the Callas-Gobbi team of Diva and Devil available on EMI, this RCA re-release (09026-63305-2) must take a back place, despite its mid-range price. And yet I know I will play it often, because I happen to be a great fan of Bjoerling and Warren! And fans are willing to put up with a lot."
4,not too bad,"This recording has its good points, but fast tempos is not one of them. The tempos seem slow and I think faster tempos capture the essence of the work better. I would recommend the Di Stefano - Callas - Gobbi version. Gobbi's voice is much better than Warren's voice, and there is more chemistry between Di Stefano and Callas. Plus, Callas was born to play Tosca. Her voice is just the right blend of emotion and youth. Her Tosca sounds very real. And while Bjoerling undoubtely has a better voice than Di Stefano, Di Stefano sounds more real, less operatic and more like a young revolutionary. Plus his pianissimos in"" E lucevan le stelle"" and ""O dolci mani"" are unequalled by anyone but Pavarotti. I heard Pavarotti live at the Met in March '04 and his pianissimos are absolutely beautiful, but thats about all he has left. The Leinsdorf is good, but the Callas (conductor escapes me) one is better drama, and after all, that is what Tosca needs to be."
5,The Mannerheim Line,"This is a great period action story. The author certainly knows his way around airplanes and gives the reader lots of unusual detail that will be appreciated by airplane buffs. The chapters on World War II in Finland provide a new picture of a little known campaign. The characters are well drawn. They aren't unrealistic glamor types, but good guys trying to get the job done. Highly recommended."
4,If you like the opening and ending themes....,then you should buy this album but if you are looking for the music that accompanies the story then I suggest looking elsewhere.
4,Very good set of DVDs,"I began using these DVDs as a novice to yoga. Deceptively simple at first. Despite my increased strength and flexibility, these DVDs are my favorites. My only objection is that I wish there was a way to turn off the cueing."
3,Definitely Basic,"This video is great for the person who is just beginning yoga and wants to learn technique and the effects of the moves. After a couple of viewings though, all of the discussion causes it to move rather slowly."
2,"Don't be fooled, ladies!","Is this a powerful workout? Sure. Will it make you sweat? Absolutely! But is it a ""walking"" workout? No way. In my opinion, this is a true medium-impact aerobic workout. I liked that there were 3 levels to choose from so you can customize your workout, but the title is totally misleading. I consider myself to be in shape, but I do have knee problems, which were aggrivated after this workout. Like a few reviewers have already said, you're probably better off not purchasing this tape if you have knee issues; there IS jogging involved in levels 2 and 3. I much prefer Leslie Sansone's WATP series, as they're effective yet low-impact, and they involve using weights to tone the arms. All in all, I'm somewhat disappointed I spent my money on this particular workout."
1,Not a Walking DVD,"This was not what I was expecting, its more aerobics, and not walking. Its too fast to follow and too many routines to catch on to. I only bought this because it was a good price. But I will not be using it. Leslie Sansone is definitely better than this."
4,Really cool book,"Although you messed up on the timelines, ancient Egypt is a relatively good book.it engrossed me in bed time reading and has accurate and interesting data,information, and facts."
4,Good Stuff,"Best bang for your buck. Recommended by a buddy, I can say two thumbs up, solid constructions, sound great. Only negative is that I bought 2, then i bought another and the paint color (white) was off a little from the first two..."
5,The Best CD by Alpha Wave Movement!,"I bought this CD many years ago and I still play it to this day. The ethereal landscapes that AWM creates takes you off to another place/dimension/plane. Great for meditating and relaxing with its dreamy mind altering sounds. After this CD, AWM went on to develop other musical creations that show influences from Steve Roach to Klaus Schulze, to Kraftwork, but he does it in a manner that makes it all his own. I have almost all of AWMs CDs and would always come back to this one. And now the best thing to have happened to the internet has occured. Alpha Wave Movement is all for download via Amazon! Download them all. You won't regret it."
2,O2 Sensor - Bosch,"Item fit perfectly, however I would NEVER service another Volvo. Almost impossible to reach connection. Initially eliminated ""check engine"" light (CEL) and associated code, but CEL and code came back in less than a week. Acquired as favor to my sister to help her pass state vehicle inspection, regrettably after CEL reappeared she took vehicle to nearby mechanic who replaced and threw away part - so I could not return. The CEL/code has not reappeared since he replaced this item (over 2 years ago.)"
3,"Good concept, needs expansion and updating","This book is heavy on pro-breastfeeding content, but actually a little light on specific topics such as how to estimate how much milk you will need to pump for your baby while you are at work. Also, the book is out of date in terms of pumps that it describes (e.g., no mention of the Avent Isis or the latest Medela models)."
2,Not the Information I was Looking For,"I was disappointed by this book. Much of it was devoted to convincing you to breastfeed, and what I wanted was practical how to advice! Also, I found much of the advice too time consuming and a bit unrealistic for the typical working mom. I have nursed and worked a full time job for the past 4 months, and my pumping schedule doesn't come close to those shown in the book! Overall, I would have preferred more ""real life"" stories and more examples of different ways to combat common problems that you may encounter while working and breastfeeding.All this being said, of the nursing/working books out there, this is probably the best one."
1,This book sets levels of acheivement that many women cannot,"I bought this book to aid me in returning to workafter being out on maternity leave for 4 months.When I read the suggested schedule for a 4 month old, I was shocked.the schedule has you nursing or pumping a tremendous number of times including 3 times during the nightand at 8:15am and 5:30pm as well as twice druing the work day.Only a superhuman with a very understanding boss who lives very close to work and needs almost no sleepcoud pull this off.This book made me feel that nursing while working was almost impossible withoutgiving up on sleep and not being very productive at work.Now that I am back at work, I find that working and nursingcan be accomplished on a much easier schedule than the book shows.Working mothers need support not unrealistic goals."
4,Pleasant,"I really only wanted it for one song ""Soldier's Last Letter"". The cd was good, just too short, even for a country cd. 23+ minutes for a $$$ cd, hmm."
2,Disapointing...,"I too have enjoyed Nat King Cole in ""Espanol"" since the soundtrack to In The Mood For Love. This however was a disappointment as several track fade unnaturally, despite there being a natural ending version available. This is particularly disappointing on the first track Acercate Mas. Furthermore, the ""remastering"" sounds a little thin and unnatural. I wish Capitol would gather together all of Cole's Spanish language songs and release them in a proper remaster. While it was only $9.99, I could have spent it elsewhere and been happier."
4,Exemplary family for Jazz,"A beautiful music, a fine film and the chance to see an exemplary family for the grandeur of Jazz.Please play it again..."
3,"Great music, poor quality","Great music but poor technical quality, no bonus apart from interviews. But it's the Marsalis, the best in Jazz. Greatest moment : Harry Conink Jr. coming on the set.J.Yager, France"
5,Nice and creative frame design,Very niceQuality is goodI put my kids photo wearing karate clothes : )I really like it ..it is a creative frame design
3,In depth,"Guerilla is an in-depth look at the SLA and the Hearst kidnapping. It's well done and up to date. If you're interested in that part of history, you'll find Guerilla great."
4,Great CD!,"This is a really Good CD! I probably would have given it a 5 if it weren't for songs 4 and 12. I am a christian, whitch is why I don't neccaserrily like song #12. My favorite 2 songs are Catchafire(Woopsidaisi)and The Slam. There are only 2 people I know, besides myself, who realized that The Slam was a christian song, at least until they read the book! I recomend TOBYMAC to every christian. It's the best christian CD.If you like this CD, he's also on Thank You, a song on the Rebbecah St. james CDWritten by Dustin Hawley, age 9"
5,Slammin',"I liked Momentum, but I love this one! It's got everything from George Clinton funky type beats (Welcome To Diverse City) to DC talk (Atmosphere) feel to it. This is music that you can dance to and praise God with. I love how he is trying to bring us all together with his music! Go TobyMac!"
1,Waste of time and money,I bought this CD thinking it was going to be a more hard core follow up to the amzing Momentum CD. I popped it into my CD player at the gym and tried to find a song to get me motivated... it failed horribly. There is too much hip hop for me. Momentum had the Hip Hop/ hard core/ loud guitars/ screaming elements that I enjoy. This is simply rap. I regret buying it.
4,Welcome To Diverse City,This Cd is great! It has great energy and an awesome message! Its hard sometimes finding a Cd that is worth listening to but the 'Welcome To Diverse City' cd has great lyrics and relates to alot of teens out there!
1,"order not complete, no followup from vendor","vendordid not send all items listed on the product description and after sending several emails to Amazon and vendor, received just one canned response. Learned a lesson and will not be ordering from Amazon again...."
5,Happy home...,Love these (and so do Auggie and Rosie). I at first bought just one. It was super easy to set up. I then ordered another and have the two side by side with the doors open. The two rabbits hop happily back and forth throughout the day and night. They were priced well. They arrived quickly and well packaged.
3,Great rabbit cage,"Ths cage is perfect for a small rabbit, there is enough room for food water housing and all the rabbit needs. I would buy again. Perfect for my holland lop. The only con is that the wheels don't attach well they fell off with in 2 days. I really did nt lie the wheels anyway they allowed mt child to push around the cage."
5,Great movie,"I bought this for my almost three year old son based on hype of the movie and the Fisher Price characters. He likes the movie and so do I. It's entertaining, exciting, and positive. We don't have any character toys yet, but maybe for his b-day or xmas. I'd recommend it."
3,good movie,"my two rescue heroes (5 & 2) loved this movie; it had a lot of scratches when it arrived, however, it plays fine (I bought it used)"
1,Very Poor Quality,"When we took the rails, etc., out of the box, the rails were split from top to bottom; not structurally sound at all. When I called the manufacturer about this, he told me that it was ""the nature of the wood"" to crack and split. Give me a break. Save yourself some time and trouble and look elsewhere for a swing."
5,CLASSIC ALBUM!! BUY IT!!!,This album is a classic and nothing less. Another Classic of his is (Life of Joseph W. McVey) if you don't have it... buy it. Its worth every penny!
2,Women show power and weakness in Revolutionary America,"Hannah Foster Webster uses letters to tell a story of Eliza and her lovers. Although this is an ingenious method, it makes the reading so complex.Webster also explores the power that women have in Revolutionary America. It is a good portrayal of the exception. In a time when most women are ruled by their father or husband, Eliza and her mother are both independent. The most striking detail of the book is that Eliza is actually ""past her prime"" in terms of that era. She is 37 years old; many women would have been married at 16. Altogether this book was a good and quick read and I would recommend it to those who like history or women's studies."
3,A Classic Female Tale,"""The Coquette"" is a great reminder of the things that women were forced to endure. Although the protagonist does not fall entirely blameless - the story itself shows the problems females faced during this time period.A great read - a bit of romance, sex and all that comes with the title!"
3,Nid - Waking Up,"Nid's first release in the US, WAKING UP, starts off with the pleasing melodic trance of the title track, but the talented Swede moves into the pretty, if uninspiring, breaks with ""Stars."" Though much of the album follows in this vein (nice, but...), there are some moment of surprise, like the disco funk of ""Shout It Out"" or the slower electro stomp of ""ICBA."" But other attempts, like the techno ballad of ""This Could Be Our First Day"" fall flat. Still, he's most in his element when delivering dreamy trance, so ""Yukawa 5 AM"" easily ups the quality quotient. A pleasant enough experience."
4,Silver Belles Rock!,"I love tap dance and used to do it myself, so this documentary really resonated with me. Loved seeing the old photos of the women as young dancers at the Cotton Club...and seeing them still hoofing into their 80's. It was very heart warming. I wish there were more old footage, and a little less of them riding the bus and hailing cabs. But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone who loves dance.Don't miss the dance lesson--learn the Shim Sham Shimmy!"
5,Been Rich All My Life is a Joy to Watch,"This film is beautifully realized. The history of these dancers and how much they've contributed individually and collectively is a joy to behold. It should be required viewing for anyone interested in being an entertainer or being entertained. Dancing has kept these beautiful women vital, joyous and alive. Peggy Lee said it all when she sang ""........if that's all there is my friend , then lets keep dancing.........""."
5,Very nice!,"This is a wonderful book about gymnastics. It has lots of pictures. It's about a 10 year old gymnast who has aspirations to be in the olympics. It shows how she trains. The pictures are in black & white. Not only does it contains pictures of her, but also other gymnasts are here also. Nadia, Bart Conner & Kurt Thomas and more.First published in 1978, it's a little dated-but it shows gymnastics as it once was. Very nice!"
3,A word on the DVD,"The aspect ratio is not 1.66 as stated on the jewel case -- it is standard 1.33 with occasional cropping on the sides. Also, the English subtitles are in a small font and the letters and words closely run together, making it difficult to read. The frontal male nudity in one scene was unexpected and unusual, a plus, however."
2,The Runaway,The reading became boring at times due to the repeated nature of the writing. The storey line is good and over all carries the Martina Cole identity.
3,Photo Study of Luftwaffe X-Planes of World War II,"Prolific Luftwaffe author Manfred Griehl collects in ""Luftwaffe X-Planes"" a brief but fascinating collection of photos of experimental and prototype planes of the Luftwaffe. The majority of the book, 55 out of 80 pages, is of photos. Unfortunately, there is not much information on the history of these planes or even the history of World War II testing centers, evaluation units, or much else about these planes for the general reader to grasp their significance in the overall context of the Luftwaffe. In sum, as a photo study of these planes it works. As a general history of them it is far too sketchy. (This last point is particularly irksome as no bibliography for further reading is provided.)"
5,Chain link fence weaving,"I am the owner and operatetor of a small kennel. When I clean in the morning and on nice days, my boarders go outside for fresh air and playtime. I have 6 outdoor runs with a play area,but there are some dogs that will just bark at other dogs because they can ""see"" them. Back home (I'm from the east coast) we had the fence weaving for privacy on our fenceing,trying to find it out here in the mid-west was hard.I was thrill when I check with Amazon.com to see that they had it.It is a durable product, easy to install and it did the job I bought it for, I would recommend this product if you already have a Chain link fence and you are looking for privacy in your own back yard. It is available in your choice of colors."
1,privacy privacy privacy,"While working at a blind nudist colony I had to put up a privacy Fence that would keep people from peering into the pool area. I bought this at the local flea market thinking it was a good deal.It's made out of cheap vinyl in China so it won't last many seasons. On top of that, you can see right through the fence vinyl so there's no privacy at all. There's some privacy slats made out of heavy plastic that are better or you can use old bricks from abandoned factories.Eventually I was fired so I didn't care either way but realize that the fence vinyl can be cut with a knife very easily to peer in. Dog urine will also cause rot."
4,magnaflow exhaust,"first of all i have to say this is an amazing product, it looksand sounds amazing. not too loud and raspy like other exhaust systemsonly down side of this cat-back is it HAS TO BE MODIFIED to fitthe piping between the resonator and the cat is too long. its notthat much of a problem just get it cut and flared to the size u needand you'll be set"
5,Slick Watch,"When the watch arrived, I was pleasantly surprised... It looks more expensive... So far (it's been over a year), we haven't had any quality issues with it... Overall a good looking watch."
4,A good essential collection for fans of Brit Rock,"Although not having as many of my personal favourites as the original import version, which is now unavailable, I think this collection is the best one currently on the market. Having a good selection of songs, instrumental styles, and artists, it could be considered one collection essential to fans of the early British Rock Invasion. Not only have the editors included many classic standards but also some works lesser known to this country that deserve equal acclaim.Overall, I'm glad to have it as part of my rock collection!"
2,Generic,"I bought this book and returned it after I saw that it had nothing to teach the more learned users of Premiere. I was really dissapointed when I saw that it couldn't tell me how to sync a fast-paced video with multiple scenes, just the usual scrubbing technique."
3,"Quick workout, complicated steps","I love the 10 minute solutions series so I was very excited to do the dance one but the choreograhy was very difficult. Because the work out is only 10 min, the instructor went through everything very quickly. I had to keep rewinding trying to learn the steps. Needless to say I have only used this once or twice and have not gone back to it. I was very disappointed."
3,above average,"i have discovered the most consistent problem with at-home exercise dvds: the music is always terrible!! it's tough enough to get motivated to work out in your livingroom, but the dull, elevator music is as uninspiring as can be. i know that these trainers don't want to pay for licensing of big hits, but there is a TON of stock music out there there is WAY better than this stupid drum-machine fare. that having been said, i think this trainer is likable and fairly good. she actually makes a few mistakes in her steps, which is fine. the routines take a littel while to get down, but you can work up a sweat if you want with this dvd."
3,Almodovar Lite,"This perfectly enjoyable but somewhat forgettable movie is Almodovar Lite. If you like that previously-quirky-and-now-more-serious Spanish director, then you'll find ""Amor de Hombre"" a good way to pass the time.The story is very simple: A rather immature, attractive gay man claims he wants a relationship, but all his actions indicate otherwise. This causes exasperation in his female bosom buddy, who can't seem to find a straight man of her own. That's about it. It's well made, though, and has some funny moments.I'd recommend these other films of a similar type more highly: Italy's ""His Secret Life"" (extremely good - read my review for that one), Brazil's ""Possible Loves"" (a ""Sliding Doors"" concept, with excellent performances) and Spain's ""Km. 0"" (not perfect, but charming)."
3,Book Review,"The book was outdated, which I was made aware of before purchasing. But for less than [$$$] (shipping incl.) I can't complain. Condition of the book was very good and the service I received was excellent. I will certainly buy from Amazon.com again. Although it was perhaps more for the history of famous individual dogs from the 50's, I did pick up some good info on the breed. I expected more info on Chow Chows in general and didn't realize that most of the pics were black & white. All-in-all, I'm happy with the book!"
4,like this combination of Monsterfest,"Both of these movies are great. The shipping was good and the DVD functioned well with no problems. I love old scary movies, so if you like old scary movies, you will like this."
2,Mixed Opinions,"Both movies need computer graphic corrections. The first movie, Ghost of Hanley House, old-fashioned, very simplistic storyline with holes, acting is not Oscar level but was a job for people. Oddest part of the movie was that the sound effects sounded at times, too real even compared to today's standards.Bela Lagosi movie (forgot the title (hint)) needs extensive visual repair, could not discern all of the low budget imagery. Storyline was shaky but visuals made it hard to give this movie better commentary.Curiousity of special effects, story, and sets of the moviemaking time period, were the reasons for purchase."
5,GREAT LOOKING KIDS MOVIE,"MY NEPHEW WAS 4 WHEN WE 1ST WATCHED THIS MOVIE TOGETHER, HIS EYES WERE GLUED TO THE THE TUBE AS THESE CARS WERE ZOOMING AROUND. IM NOT SURE HE CARED ALOT ABOUT THE PLOT. HE CERTAINLY LOVES HOTWHEELS CARS AND THIS MOVIE HAS BEEN VIEWED SEVERAL TIMES BY HIM. HES MY LITTLE EXPERT ON KIDS STUFF AND THIS MOVIE HE LIKED QUITE ABIT. I SEEN THE OTHER HOT WHEELS MOVIES THIS ONE CERTAINLY WAS THE BEST ONE. IT HAS ALOT OF HIGH SPEED ACTION THAT I MUST ADMIT LOOKED PRETTY GOOD TO ME AS WELL. THAN AGAIN I HAD HOTWHEELS TOO AS A KID :)"
1,Pop Star isn't what I was looking for,"SHES SO REAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHES STILL A NEW POP PRINCESS TRYING TO LOOK PUNK WITH HER BLONDE HAIR, BUT HER MUSIC DOESNT REFLECT THAT!"
5,Marveloous book.,"This is among the two or three best books on Buddhist practice that I have ever used, and I use it almost daily."
5,One man's battle against all odds in WWII,"Douglas Bader, legless as the result of an aircraft accident, becomes Britains greatest fighter pilot as he conquers all adversities in his fight against the Germans and the beauracracy of the British Air Force."
4,mesmerizing,since this novel was an assigned reading... I was fully prepared to be bored outta my wits.Jacinta is irresistable... her voice draws you in to her life and you are a captive audience until the last page...thoroughly enjoyed...
5,"A stellar Far, Far Future SF stories collection","Gardner Dozois collects a fine assortment of really far future SF stories in one of his best anthologies to date.The theme of ""far far future"" is handled in many diverse ways, as the stories themselves were written over almost fifty years.Jack Vance has an excerpt from his Dying Earth series...and Paul McAuley has a prequel to his ""Confluence"" novels. In between lie classics like Pohl's satiric Day Million, Silverberg's Nightwings and a story related to Gene Wolfe's Book of the Sun series. And many others, from authors like Michael Moorcock and Poul Anderson.All in all, this is one of the best SF anthologies I have yet read."
3,Better Quality Then I Expected,"Along with the 2006 release of Lugosi's The Deer Slayer, this is a big upgrade from the collector's copy I own & I would recommended it for Lugosi fans; I paid an Amazon 3rd party seller $3.79 + shipping brand new & consider it a steal at that price!Alpha seems to be cleaning up their act lately. While nowhere near the quality we expect from Kino, Image, Criterion, etc, this print is of much higher quality then the pd collector's copies on ebay & higher quality then I expected. It didn't used to be that way, I have several pd prints that are much better then the equivalent pre 2006 Alpha releases."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I bought this printer/copier/scanner when it was on sale at Best Buy. While the print quality wasn't good enough for pictures, it worked GREAT for printing documents for about a year. Then it just broke/stopped working. I thought it was just me getting a faulty printer, but my friend has the exact same one and the same thing happened to him. So I have to assume they just aren't that well made. Furthermore, putting a new ink cartridge in is extremely annoying and difficult. So I regrettably have to give this pathetic machine one star.I'll never buy anything made by Lexmark again after this!"
5,hilarious,"These two books are Born to Run and Chrome Circle bound together. It can be a little confusing because they are the first and fourth books in a series, and one of the main characters in Chrome Circle originated from the second book in the series. These books are very funny, and Tannim is a very cool character. The first book starts very abruptly, but it was understandable and exciting. Two thumbs up."
4,Very nicely done.,"Before watching this movie I thought it would be a sleazy excuse for nudity and sex, it wasn't that at all. Anyone who is a fan of Lucy Irvine or has read her books should enjoy this movie as it follows the book very closely. What nudity there is isn't sexual, and seams very natural when on a tropical island. Lucy, G, and Tuin are all very well portrayed, although the island on the movie is more lush and tropical. All in all, a very good movie, and I was quite happy when I found out there was such a thing."
4,True Reality Viewing,"The day dream of anyone I ever met, put to screen in a fairly representative version of the book by Lucy Irvine who actually did pursue her dream of living on a deserted Island.The pitfalls and a honeymoon gone to trash upon arrival pose questions we all need to ask ourselves.The scenery is gorgeous and if you ever wanted to walk naked on a deserted beach in a remote corner of the Indian Ocean. This is a movie worth watching and sharing with your loved one."
5,Great Value!,These earrings are so pretty in person and look like real gem stones. They arrived quickly and in a pretty gift box just in time for my daughter's best friend's birthday :)
2,Waste of Money,"I was very disappointed with this book. It has a lot of spelling errors and it is not written in a coherent manner. It does not look like anyone edited this book before it was released. If I can spot so many errors, it must be really bad!! I ended up not using this book and got another one that is well written and clear."
3,Bach,This book is one of many I have read aboutBach. For me it offers more than I really wish to know at this time. There is alot about all the positions he held and the problems that occurred. I would rather read about the music . I actually have not finished it yet. Perhaps I will be more interested as I get in to the last half.
3,"Very knowledgable writer, dug very deep for the information. Kind of boring to read though.","The book is more like reading a book of facts rather than a biographical accounting. The writer is obviously very talented in research, but the ""storytelling"" is not intriguing and sometimes feels like reading a list of facts."
5,Great set.,"My Nokia phone has an extreme proprietary connection for headsets. With that I mean, any other but two specific models manufactured by Nokia will not work. I know. I tried. So of course, they overprice those two. Fortunately, here I found one of them at half price, and for this kind of headset, it works perfectly good. The service was fast. The price great."
4,Everyone should read it.,"In the pantheon of classic literature, there are books teachers make you read, books you read on your own, and books you think you've read because everyone talks about them as though you ought to have read them.The Prince is the third type. Read it, and discover that the term ""Machiavellian"" has come to mean something that I doubt Machiavelli really intended. Read it, and discover that Machiavelli may have been more of an optimist than people realize.In a reading group recently, members had three different translations of the book. When we argued about what Machiavelli was saying in the section on ecclesiastical states, we realized that we were coming from different directions, so we each read the versions of several passages. The consensus was that this translation is perhaps the most cynical translation into English and may be the most ""faithful"" to the modern, popular idea of Machiavelli."
5,This product brought my JVC c amcorder back from the dead.,"I thought my camara was toast. This head cleaner fixed my problem within seconds. Thankfully my JVC cam prompted me to clean the heads. Sadly, I had a cannon that encounterd the same problem of thick black lines on play back. There was no prompting and I had a repair guy tell me the device could not be fixed. Yep, in went, needlessly, into the giant trash can of life. I was astonished that circuit city did not carry any head cleaners for the camcorder they sold me. Thanks amazon."
2,Not as described,I order a JVC brand and i received a Panasonic without consulting me. Maybe it is not a big deal for others but at least i should given the opportunity to select something else rather just shove it down my throat.
4,video camera,"it was sent quickly and was what we ordered and was satsified with the cassette , we see no problem and inserted in camera and it was ready to go"
2,Buddha's Lions: The Lives of the Eighty-Four Siddhas,"The translations are too short and course. Because of that the stories come across as shallow. I did not enjoy this book, even though I am a Buddhist. This was an investment that was not worth making."
4,Ida B. Wells-Barnett: A Voice Against Violence,"I located this book at a branch of the Nashville Public Library a few years ago while doing research for a wood carving of Ida B. Wells. Of course the text is meant for a juvenile audience, but it was a very good source of pictures of Ida B.Wells and by that time more pictures were the main thing I needed.It gives a good if brief review of her life."
5,The best watch in it's price range!!!,"This is a great watch!!!! It feels heavy, it's big, it looks AWESOME with a blue shirt and it will distinguish you in any crowd! You can wear it as a dress watch or with a sports shirt, IT JUST LOOKS GREAT! The best fossil I've ever bought"
4,Great watch...thanks,"This is a great watch. I'm glad that you guys had it. I love Fossil, but didn't know of a store near me, so I used Amazon. It works well and I don't have anything bad to say about it. Well, I wish that it had a light for seeing the time at night...or glow more. It arrived on time and it's great...thanks!"
3,Good watch-seller not as great,"I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas in October-when I got it I noticed it was not running, I called Jacob's Time (where the watch was sold from), customer service rep was nice, sent a return label via e mail-I returned the watch the next day, the replaced the battery and sent the watch back. I wrapped it and put it under our tree-my husband opened it and it still was not working. I have since then returned the watch to them and they are supposed to return a new one to me-they received the watch via UPS on 1/2/07-so far I have not gotten one back in return. Hopefully this one will come soon and be in working conditon. I did also purchase another Fossil watch on line directly from Fossil and have had no issues with that one."
5,My favorite Dave Matthews album,Love this- loads of Dave Matthews personality shines through in this live album. I found a new appreciation for him after listening to it for the first time. I listen to this album more than any of his others (I own all but the last album he put out).
5,Dave Matthews + Blu-Ray = Best Concert I own,"I own many Dave Matthews Band concerts on dvd. I like them all since I ama fan, but the picture and sound quality are never both excellent at the same time. Here, on blu-ray, I finally am experiencing the best of both.Dave and Tim play at Radio City. Basically, an unplugged concert withtwo excellent musicians playing guitars. Dave does talk some in between songs. This is a pleasant surprise. It is a long concert, but isvery enjoyable to watch and listen to because of the high definitionpicture and sound. A must have for diehard fans and also a good choice for those who don't know anything about Dave Matthews."
2,boring. try a rental before buying.,"Have many blu-rays. Lots of concerts. A lot of hype has been written about this blu-ray concert, so I bought it without hesitation.Now about 2 years later, I have watched it ONCE. Boring. Boring.Try renting it. Not for everyone."
5,Another solid release,"Although not as good as the Luther College cd, this cd is another great live album by one of the most talented artist of this generation, Dave Matthews. I don't think that Tim shines on this record as he does on Luther College.In the end, this is yet another 5 star release by Dave."
3,"Pretty good, but it's no ""Luther College""","I'm a big Dave Matthews fan - I've seen DMB 40+ times in concert and was excited to pick up the Live at Radio City Music Hall cd's. After a couple of listens, I gotta admit that it's definitely pretty average in my opinion. I keep waiting for a track to take off but even on my favorites (like #41) they just seem to languish."
5,Dave & Tim at Radio City,"Excellent DVD that sounds great in surround sound. A lot of personality is portrayed, and their chemistry is easily seen on stage. Highly recommended for the acoustic lover."
5,spiritual sounds for everyone,"This remarkable CD takes delves into the virtually unknown prayers of the great 18th century mystic Vaishnava saint, Bhaktivinode Thakura. As Hildegard of Bingen's music was hidden for centuries, so has Bhaktivinode Thakura prayers and music.Now these two talented artists--Kim Murray and Hans Christian--have artfully brought this music to the attention of the new century. Please, Kim and Hans, continue in this way to do many more CD's along this line.Buy this beautifully crafted CD; I highly recommend it. You might end up listening to it daily. Rasa is simply sublime music."
1,How AWE--Ful!!,"What a BAD cd!The soloist's vocals are too..too..whatstheword.. commercial.The """"sensual"""" voice made me sick.And the Anglo-accent on Gopinatha made me even sicker.Despite all the tablas, sithars and violas in the background , the music is too western, flat,smelling of banality..A pathetic attempt at reproducing - or shall I say, imitating -classical Indian genre..And an extremely unsuccessful one.Lakshmi Shankar is way more enjoyable.And The Mahabharata (the soundtrack),maybe..And for truely successfully metamorphosed music I would rather recommend Lisa Gerrard/Dead Can Dance, and Vas, maybe."
4,Soothing the mind....,"I first heard this album during an accupunture session and loved it for it's ability to soothe and relax. Anyone who meditates, is a health practioner or a massage therapist should have this in their collection-it's perfect for just sending the mind elsewhwere. The songs are Indian prayer and devotional love songs and though I could not understand the langauge, the songs meanings shined through regardless.The musicianship and quality is excellent. One reviewer negatively comments that's it overproduced/mixed and that may be so, but there are few Western musicians can play a sarangi this well. And overmixed or not, that shouldn't steer you away from a beautiful devotional album. Listen to the singing and the instrumentation and you'll hear two musicians who have have so obviously embraced the art, the teachings and the musicianship of Indian culture and that was what I found so enjoyable about this album. Rare to find with western born musicians-this is a beautiful CD."
3,Adequate,"Not one of Flynn's best movies, but has a good score and at times is fairly fast-paced. Historically fuzzy at times, at least some of the major characters from the time period are well represented."
1,Modern Country and Elevator Music Mesh,"What a disappointing release from Delerium and company. It sounds like modern country music and elevator music merges while attempting to sound ""creative"". Don't waste your time or money."
1,Terrible lens distortion,Yes the gooseneck is good but...The clip shown in the photo is not included. Surprise!The single dim LED provides inadequate light. Surprise!The lens grossly distorts straight lines even one-eighth of an inch from the center. Surprise!No more disappointing surprises please.
3,Clip???,I bought this as a gift and was disappointed that the clip was not included as pictured. It looks like a useful product...but would be more useful with a clip!
3,keep falling down,these are very comfortable but they keep falling down. i have big calves but not huge so this is always a problem for me.
2,mediocre,"I loved Cool Steady & Easy - definitely one of my favorite CDs of all time. Saw BFE in NY a couple of years ago too; they were great live. Too bad this CD is such a disappointment. It contains none of the enthusiasm and energy of CSE. There just aren't many good ideas. The riffs are repetitive and the melodies weak, and many of the tunes drone on and on endlessly, in particular ""Mambo con Dancehall"" which is so annoying after a while I want to tear my hair out. The crosscultural borrowing of styles was fun on CSE but really sounds forced on this recording. And what is up with the guy with the low voice and Caribbean accent, who now appears on three or four tracks? Am I supposed to be impressed that he can groan, croak and moan like a zoned-out Rasta mental patient? A good cure for insomnia. Boring, like most of the record."
5,Great Book,"This book is a cross between an ""I Spy"" book and an alphabet book. All my kids have enjoyed this book. It is perfect for preschool and kindergarteners who are learning the alphabet and letter sounds. The book consists of a list of words that start with each letter of the alphabet on the left page and a picture with includes those things on the right. There are some words that are new to the kids (i.e. winch) which gives them a chance to learn, but most are familiar objects which are not too difficult to locate on the adjacent page."
4,Drive-In French,This 2-cassette package is an absolute necessity for the business traveler/tourist heading to a French speaking country. It covers the basics with uncanny ease but also moves on to more advanced topics toward the end. The conversations recorded in native French are extremely helpful for providing the listener with actual speed and accents. A+
1,terrible,"I agree with Mimo this was the worst book I have ever read. Totally unbelievable, completely insane."
4,"It works, give it a try.","This book has been a life saver. We had tried twice putting our son on ADHD medicine and both times he experienced all the negative side effects, one being hallucinations. We immediately took him off and felt desperate that nothing would help him. Then a friend of ours recommended that we read this book. We did and started with the supplements and Flax Seed oil right away. We noticed an improvement of clarity and concentration. Then we added in visits to a Chiropractor and we saw even greater results. So, a combination of the supplements and Chiropractic care made a tremendous difference. Combine those two things with a diet modification that included going gluten free and we couldn't have asked for more. I am so happy that we are following this program as word is getting out that the right types of fats are what are good for the brain and that is what is helping kids with ADHD heal."
4,Dr. Bob's guide to stop ADHD in 18 days!,"My 5 year old son was recently diagnosed with ADHD. So, when I first saw the title of this book I thought it was a joke and I was hestitant about ordering it. But to my surprise it is a great book! The book does a great job of explaining (in plain english) what ADHD is, how to begin to heal the body and how important a sugar/ dairy/ gluten free diet is.Upon his suggestion, I immediately, but graduately, changed my son's diet and found an hollistic doctor which we are currently working with. I have seen a change in his hyperactivity since removing the sugar and the fast food and he is even doing much better in school.This book is an easy read, I read it in four days! I recommend this book to all parents!"
3,not as helpful,"tried suggestions in the book without any results, good suggestions though, maybe patient is too old, 38 yrs old"
4,Heckling is a bad thing? This book is not.,"The subtitle of the book is HECKLING IS A BAD THING?Rob Szasz's book on heckling is, surprisingly, one of only two books I know of on the subject. The ""Tampa Bay heckler"" has written a book about his experiences in good-natured heckling of opponents of his team, the Devil Rays (who need all the help they can get).Ron is always tasteful in his heckling (and in the book), avoiding off color language and steering clear of anything personal that would be hurtful to the players he targets. Anyone who has watched a Tropicana game on TV (or been there) has heard Rob Szasz. He makes the point that he most enjoys the players who get a chuckle out of his heckling. The ones who can't take a joke aren't really very good targets, anyhow.The whole thing is in fun, and so is the book. I wish we had more fans like Rob Szasz."
1,Where is Web Services,I did not see any topics on Web Services.Totally misleading title.I totally agree with the other reviewer.i would give no stars at all for this one
4,Useful small cage,"We bought this cage because it has no bars, except for the lid. Our two hamsters like chewing bars too much, so this is better for them than the other CritterTrail cages, which have bars all around. We initially had our Syrian in it, but she could reach the bars on the lid, and would chew them; so now we have our dwarf hamster in it, and this is working well.I wouldn't use it as a primary home, as it's quite small. We have it linked (with CritterTrail tubing) to a 10-gallon aquarium. It serves very well as a secondary space. It seems pretty robust, and it's *very* easy to clean. The wheel is a *little* bothersome, as it tends to rub against the covering attached over the top of it, making a bit of noise. But it's not too noisy as wheels go."
3,Too many words,"Probably Mr. Nicoll's love of the written and spoken word kept him from BEING the words. I get the impression that Nicoll, like Orage, were too much in love with talking, and that caused them to lose themselves in their words. Although there is some valuable knowledge in these books, Ouspensky's ""In Search"" and ""The 4th Way"" are probably the greatest introductions to this system.These books can easily distract you from awakening by drowning you in words, so tread carefully."
2,"Got mitts? Really,really LARGE mitts?","I was overwhelmed by the size of these buggers. If you need really, really large hot mitts and have an enormous drawer in which to store them, then you will probably rate them higher than I did. I haven't even used them so can't comment on how well they protect your body because they have to go in a closet in another room. If we have a fire I will be sure to jump into them for protection."
4,Great Guide to a Great Place,"An excellent guide to this outstanding cruising area; obviously well researched and very well written and compiled. From a pilotage viewpoint, it could be improved with a few, more detailed ""chartlets"" of some of the more difficult approaches and port/dock entries, but the first rate collection of photographs and especially the superb aerial photographs (by Neil Rabinowitz) provide make up for this very minor deficiency."
5,Very pleased with this guide.,"This guide is just what I was looking for. The Pacific Northwest is new territory for us and will be less intimidating with the cruising guide at our side. Many books have points of interest to see by land, but this includes the sites by sea as well along with information on tides, currents, marine services, marinas, navigational aids and recommends specific navigation charts. The spiral binding will be helpful while underway.Thank You"
1,Revolting!,"I must say, it has been a while since I've heard Christmas music this bad (this is almost as bad as the Melba Moore holiday CD). Braxton's baritone voice does not mesh well with these types of songs (she sounds like Barry White). She practically butchers every song on this CD. Toni, just because you're able to do a few cat calls does not mean you need to record a holiday CD! Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy a decent holiday CD. This one is too dreadful for words! What an embarrassment!"
1,Toni Braxton,Very disappointed in this CD. Not the best I've ever heard. Won't be buying any more of her music.
2,Poor Video Quality.,"This version of ""Firepower"" has very low resolution and washed out video quality, recorded from VHS? The poor quality destroys the beautiful Caribbean scenery - one of the main attractions of the movie. The other main attraction is Sophia Loren, and she is able to shine through the poor quality."
5,Who knew crayons on the TV screen could be so much fun?,"The concept is simple: Two cartoon characters have adventures on TV, and you have to help them by drawing on the screen. This kit includes the plastic overlay to protect your screen, a cleaning cloth, 6 crayons, and a video with 9 adventures. Other videos are available.Who would have guessed that such a simple concept would be so much fun? Our 4 year old loves it. We're looking forward to inviting over friends so she can play again with them."
1,Its a heartbreaker.,"This extremely expurgated version sells for about a dollar a minute! So if you think a 15 minute (estimate) feature is worth the price, by all means, buy this. If not, save yourself the heartbreak I suffered."
1,Some folks call it a Sling Blade,"This is not the movie I order, I don""t know way amazon sales this DVD Its not a movie at all. I order SLING BLADE. I am very disapointed."
5,Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm,"If you are a fan of Shep Field's Rippling Rhythm, you will enjoy this cd album as I did. It helped me complete my collection of his style of music."
3,poor packaging,The design of the product serves purpose with adjustable height so that I can stand to work with my computer. However there's very little packaging protection so the pressed broad for the desktop had a few dents through shipping.
4,A double edged sword,"I enjoyed this book a lot however, there were a few things that lessened my enjoyment. One was the fact that Kait had the same thoughts over and over again ""I need to help my sister save her marriage"", ""my sister can't be as bad as they say she is""; it got repetitive and annoying. It was like get a clue! Also, the love story wasn't all that developed or believable. Overall, the book was a good read but when something starts to bug you, the enjoyment level goes down."
1,Lots of lip-wetting,"Seriously, I think this woman in the story, Kait, should invest in Chapstick, 'cause she's got to have a severe case of chapped lips with all the lip-licking she does.This book made me want to barf. Horribly cliche, sophomoric plot, stupid, unlikeable characters. And terrible ""romance"" scenes; the guy, Trev, spends most of his time screaming at Kait that he can't stand her and wants her out of his house, but two seconds later he's all ""damn baby, you're lookin' good."" Please. Oh, and my favorite line from the entire thing, just as they're about to have sex for the first time ""...not because he was huge, which he was..."" Seriously? I think I actually tasted bile in my mouth when I read that.If this book is any kind of indication of the author's other works, then someone please tell me how in the hell she is a bestseller?"
4,Excellent practice for both law school and Bar Exam,"This book contains 24 essay questions and model answers. In addition, it has 103 multiple choice questions that are similar to those on the multistate bar examination. Each question explains why the answer is correct and the other possible choices are wrong. The tricky hearsay exceptions were were explained."
1,DOA Receiver,"Turned on OK, but wouldn't play anything, AM, FM, CD, DVD, or TV Sound. Returned without replacement because selection button labels too hard to see in normal lighting. Kudos to Amazon's 30-day return policy."
5,"Excellent value, great features","This 6.1 reciever offers 110 w/channel with subwoofer output. Sony has clearly worked to make the receiver smarter to provide the best audio experience with minimal intervention from the user: a microphone input (mic provided) automatically locates each speaker attached and balances all outputs.If you're interested in simply having great home theater experience, without excessive tweaking, this is the reciever for you.Pros - multiple a/v inputs, with support for component video and and optical connections for dvd audio.Cons - no upsampling video sources (component output from component input only), no optical connection for cd players."
2,"Please DiC, spare me!","Ok, I normally like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor moon Series, but C'mon DiC! the cover is hidieos! Chibi-usa (Rini) isn't Sailor Chibi-Moon Until Sailor Moon S. And well, all the covers for ADV's ""Dubbed feture of Sailor Moon"" Covers are hideios, american-drawn (no offence), and when you pass it you probobley think ""Ok, who is gonna bye this?"" The covers basicly show what the movie is about so if you passed it, you'd think it was another ""Super Girl Chick Flick"" 1 sugestion:Get the UNCUT, just pass the dub, like it is a barney video...Overall, I'd rate this 4.9/5, but DiC, PLEASE! (Dubb 2.3..."
1,CAUTION! These are remixes a new recording! Buyer beware!,"The original ""Planet Rock"" will always be a dancefloor favorite, but this is a RERECORDING of the song, and it has lost all of its cool. The vocoder affects are different, the vocal performances are weak, the Kraftwerk sample was replaced by someone playing the synth line (using the sample was what made this song notable when it was first released),and most of the remixes are just plain boring. If you're still interested in this release, I strongly suggest that your find some samples to audition first; I wish I had..."
2,less than exciting,"Tricky to operate, fair results, batteries drain if left in even with unit off. Not recommended."
4,Not for the TYPICAL 8 or 9-year-old.,"This has some really g-r-e-a-t pranks and gags, IF you CAN find the time to supervise the projects.As ""eight and above"" is sort of a subjective starting point, I wouldn't base it on MATURITY --- but,rather, on their, r, uh... IM-maturity.You know what I mean... You K=N=O=W your kid.If he/she doesn't find the prospect of owningThe Original Fart Machine #2 - Remote Fart Machineorsomething like t-ha-t, he/she will totally NOT appreciate THIS either.Now, if the kid thinks aFart WhistleSOUNDS funny... you've got a kid that is --- almost --- as im-mature as ME!My 100-year-old Gran'pa John used to tell me ""Ya GOTTA get older -- ya DON'T gotta grow-up!The family that shares a fart whistle --- or woopie cushion--- ... LAUGHS together!"
1,Problem with the lenses,"First of all, the case is made of cheap plastic that after two weeks started to breake in pieces.Just after two years having those sunglasses both lenses showed stains. The lenses are made of two layers glued together and started to separate.It wasn't under warranty anymore, had to throw them away.Then I bought another Ray-Ban just to regret again because after a couple of months the temple tips started to fall apart.Will never purchase from them again!!!"
3,Not Mr. Flint's Best Work,"A slow read. All the weird names and different ""tribes"" and ""armies"" are confusing at times. Characters are hard to keep straight. I am half way throgh and don't know if I will finish it,"
4,Rewriting History in the Indian Subcontinent,"David Drake has mined the Belisarius story more than once under other names. Now he uses Belisarius by name in an alternative history novel.I was entralled by how various technologies are entertwined in a story about philosophy and war and what is ""right"". You are never in doubt about who will win, it is just a question of how hard the victory will be fought.This is the first time I have ever seen someone show an example of the difference between fighting a war from a strategic view as opposed to a tactical view.The book is flawed only in the lack of character development. You see what the characters DO, but why they think what they are doing is correct is not examined."
2,Big disappointment...,"Nine piece band from New Orleans featuring C.C.Adcock on guitar along with John Hiatt, Sonny Landreth, Steve Riley, etc. Sounds great huh? Big disappointment. Found the wall-of-sound to be flat and it just never jelled for me."
4,A definite improvement from his last few,"I'm a big Luis Miguel fan, but I've been somewhat dissapointed with his last few cd's. However, THIS is a big improvement. The best song in this album is definitely the last one, QUE HACER. What a beautiful, well crafted song. It's as good as his old classics, Tengo Todo Excepto a Ti, Hasta Que Me Olvides, Hoy El Aire Huele A Ti. I never have to worry about his voice, since he's always on the money. 33 has many good songs, a couple not as good, but overall a solid disc. I'm glad he hit it out of the park with the last song though."
5,"Fresh, Clean Tasting Water.",What a great product. No more 5 gallon bottle deliveries to worry about. No more giant cooler using electricity and making noise in my home. Now I have an elegant pitcher and a simple filter providing me with great water. I have actually gotten compliments on how good the water tastes.
4,The best price I coud find,I chose 4* just without much knolegde how godd it is. Flavor of the water with this filter is somewhat different. you would have to make some chemical tests in order to find out how good this product is. My wife likes it and I just belive that this makes your water somehow better.
1,Green slime in Brita pitcher,"I have been using a Brita pitcher for years but with the last two boxes of filters, a green slime grew in the pitcher after less than a month of use. I've heard the Brita faucet filter attachments are worse. I'm looking for another product."
1,Not good any more,"They changed their design to speed up the water filtering and caused lots of black dust getting into the water. If you check the water using a white bow, you would find lots of them."
4,Just as expected,"Three filters, for Brita, and pretty forthright. Price was not quite as good as I would have liked, but it was nice to be able to order them with the pitcher."
4,Not much to say,These are just replacement filters so there isn't much you can say here. They arrived on time and have worked fine.
3,"arrived on time, usable, but leaks small black particles","I bought it in March 2009, it arrived on time, good to use-- but all the four replacement filters that I used leak small black particles into the base of pitcher.I was not overtly concerned about the black particles-- guess it's just carbon from the filter. But my previous filters (bought from Target) didn't have this long-lasting leak-- they cleared out after three water replacements.Is it the same quality bought this purchase? I have no other test to verify, but it would be nicer if the small black particle leakings would be improved.Thanks"
5,best deal on the planet,"what is there to say about these filters. They work, cheapest to buy them is on Amazon. And who wants to go buy bottled water everyday. Gotta love these"
2,charcoal powder in the filtered water,"In the instruction it says it is OK that there are slight amount of charcoal powder in the filtered water, but I found it to be less OK. I found charcoal in the bottom of my cup all the time, I don't know how much charcoal I have drank already. Now our drinking water doesn't contain heavy metals but charcoal!"
4,glug glug glug,"These canisters work great, when the water comes to them the surface area of the filtration media is like thousands of places for the water to pass by."
3,Dirty filters - need better packaging/shipping,"These arrived in an old beat up Brita box, and each filter was completely covered in carbon dust - all black!! I was afraid to use them, but was able to rinse them off enough to give them a try and they do filter fine and the water tastes enough like previous Brita filters."
5,Great price on these,We filter all our cooking and drinking water at home from our well. From the tap it has a bit of a odd taste to it but with our Brita water pitcher it tastes like water should.
5,water tastes fresh and clean,These filters are easy to install. They do only go in there one way though so just keep turning it until it fits. It seems to remove all the bad taste from the water as well as the stuff floating in it. Works quite well.
5,A great deal on something we always use.,"We got 10 Brita filters for just over $3.80 per filter.A great deal! We have used Brita water filters for years.The water is great, we don't pollute with plastic bottles,we save money over other options, and we are confident thatthe water is healthful to drink."
1,Why the extra $3 for shipping all of a sudden,"I've purchased this item through amazon a few times, but now it's not eligible for amazon prime and there's an extra $3 shipping charge? What a rip-off. Purchase this item elsewhere."
2,Not original Brita filters,"This review is for the 10-pack from the seller ""Velvet Cake"". The filters I received came loosely packaged, and they had purple printing on them. I checked for the ""Brita"" name, and couldn't find it. They don't exactly look like Brita filters either--side-by-side with original filters (which I'd also bought from Amazon, just not from this seller) you can see differences in the original vs the ones I just received.I think that selling these as actual Brita filters is false advertising, and I haven't decided whether I want to return them or use them anyway. I paid the price I did because I thought they were original filters, and I would not have paid this much had I known they wouldn't be original."
2,Some of the filters leak carbon,"I bought this pack to replace a 2 month old filter (like it asks you to). I soaked my first filter in water for fifteen minutes, made two full pitchers and dumped both out. When I filled it up again, and took a sip, it tasted absolutely horrible. So I repeated the process of filling it up all the way and dumping it FIFTEEN times. Despite my persistence, the taste did not go away.I ended up throwing the first one away and using the second one. At first I had the same issues, however over time it went away.Two stars because the second one worked, but If I wanted to taste carbon I'd head out west, get oil fracking rigs on my property, and drink the groundwater raw. Or I would use these filters. Definitely disappointed."
3,Good price,"Ive been using a Brita filter for years. Got a good deal on amazon for a five pack. The filter needs to soak for a bit at first, before using and I usually dump out the first two pitcherfulls. I find it a bit annoying that little pieces of carbon leak into the top portion of tank, and I'm not convinced that there is really any health benefit to using the filters, but the pitcher is convenient way to always have cold water on hand."
3,"Good, but needs improving","My taste buds tell me that these filters are working.However, the little black charcoal particles that float into the top reservoir are annoying. The manual tells you to ignore these, but I would prefer it if Brita would just fix the product. Also, the filters do not always make a good seal in the pitcher, so unfiltered water can drip into the bottom reservoir."
3,Brita Review,"I've used Brita for a long time, but I think its time for a change. I get charcoal smudges at the bottom of my glass which is unappealing. I may try PUR next time."
1,Does this really eliminate 99% lead???,"Many consumers who buy this product believe that it eliminates lead from their drinking water. The product specs on Amazon also claims 99% lead removal (Amazon has since removed this claim).When I examined their pitcher, I found a lot of legal stff at the bottom of the pitcher in very hard to read font. This alerted me - if a product does eliminate 99% lead, why would they not advertise it in big letters right in front?Then I looked carefully at the box in which the replacement filters came in.Turns out - The certification is on the side of the box - is again in very tiny font. So you will normally fail to notice it is in there. The only claims made are for copper, mercury and cadmium. No mention of lead. Why can't Brita tell us what the deal is regarding lead reduction in BIG COLORFUL font?If you are using this product believing it to reduce lead levels - time to wake up. I'm going back to my earlier sears system which was NSF certified to remove 99% of lead."
1,Changing to another system,"Although I have used these filters successfully for several years, the most recent supply last only 2-3 weeks before completely clogging. I have always followed the instructions to a T. But, when I contacted Brita ""No Customer Service,"" the reply I received indicated I must have not installed them correctly. After reading through the many low ratings on Amazon, and reading on line about many other problems, it's obvious that Brita refuses to admit they ever have a problem of any kind. Disgusting! Switching to another system."
1,Description indicates these are used.,"The product indicates that these are:3 used from $21.25Is this correct and they are used water filters. If so, not interested."
4,Good filter but leaves a granular residue,"The purified is rally clean and tastes good, but the upper container tends to have loose residue which need to be discarded every now and then."
5,Always works OK,"I've been using Brita filters for years, I've never had any problems in using it and the water is always fresh and with a good flavor.I recommend it."
1,The filters from Amazon are terrible,"Normally, my Brita filters last two to three months. The filters I just bought from Amazon are lasting two to three weeks. I suspect they are being stored wrong by Amazon, but can't exclude the possibility that Amazon is buying remainders, thus they are old, or they are selling counterfeit filters."
4,Good filters,"I know coffee purists say not to use filtered water while brewing, but our tap water tends to be on the metallic side. These filters remove that taste and make a great tasting coffee. What is there to complain about? Free shipping and good filters."
5,Great Price!,Amazon had the best price for the refills and it was just a click away. The best part was that it came sooner than expected and the packaging also fit the product delivered.
1,The king was irate; the reader was bored,"I wanted to like this Updike novel so much. First of all, I was intrigued by the idea of a pre-quel to Hamlet; what an interesting idea! Secondly, I enjoy John Updike's writing quite a bit. But this book just seemed very flat to me. Considering the building excitement of Hamlet that starts in the very first scene of the play, this tale meandered along sooo slowly, without passion. Even Updike's deft turn of a phrase wasn't enough to rescue this stolid, somnolent little book."
3,Has Updike Lost It?,"Gertrude and Claudius - the very title resonates with passion: lust, incest, hatred, madness, and despair. In Updike's hands, this archetypal story descends to the level of a commonplace tale of suburban adultery. Updike's characters do not feel, suffer, dare. They are moved by their whims and desires only, like leaves on the autumn wind. Ultimately, it does not seem to matter very much. Is this what Updike means? Does he really care? Should we?"
3,An enjoyable literary game,"John Updike's Gertrude and Claudius is a breezy and enjoyable take on Shakespeare's Hamlet with the years leading up to the Bard's tragedy. Despite working in 14th century Denmark instead of modern day New England, Updike still manages to cover the same territory: women and marriage, women and love, women and power, women and infidelity, women and death, and finally women and God. I can't wait to rent Kenneth Brannaugh's Hamlet to view Julie Christie as Gerturde. A fun and light read, all in all"
5,Great Product,I purchased this to go under my wedding gown. It was very cheap compared to the bridal shop's price and the same quality.
2,Really bulky,"This bra is really bulky. The material is too thick, and it forms a fold under the cups. It didn't fit me right either - the top portion was a little tight, and the bottom portion was too loose. I would definitely not recommend this bra!"
1,This book has many errors.,This book does not explain things very clearly. There are many errors in the book. I will not use this book again. I would not recommend buying this book.
2,No building!,"This book is not a guide. It simply gives you the source and explains how it works, and not a very good job at that. This was my second FlashMX book, and I wasn't please with either. Learn FlashMX in 24 Hours was better but neither were sound teaching guides. I'm still looking for one that will teach me to build a decent Flash site."
3,Not sure it will help your hair grow any faster....,"I recently cut 6 inches of my hair off because it was very damaged from highlighting and the amount of swimming I was doing in preparation for a triathlon. I liked my hair longer and was looking for something to help grow it back out. I've been using this product for a week now and haven't really noticed a difference (yet). The smell reminds me of either the cheap beauty school shampoo that was used in the cosmetology classes I had in high school, or the rest area sanitation scent I recall when traveling out of state as a child...not pleasant, but tolerable I guess. I will use the products until they are empty, but I'm not sure I will buy this again. Also, the conditioner does not detangle so well."
1,Made Hair Worse,"so i bought this shampoo and conditioner because the reviews were pretty good nd i was excited to get it. the first time i used it, my hair felt like straw after but i wanted to keep trying so i gave it baout a week but it made my hair feel dry and even more damaged them before. i even let the conditioner sit in my hair for 3-5 mins. im caucasion and i dont know if that effects it in any way but i hated it and wasted my money on it."
1,Makes my hair feel yucky!,"I was really excited about trying Grow. It was also recommended by my hair stylist, however all it did was dried out my scalp and made my hair feel very straw-like. I can't continue to use it because I don't like the way it makes my hair feel so I don't know if it would make it grow faster or not. Hopefully other people have better success with it."
4,A Must Have That Requires Creativity,"The book is very inspiring and well written. The most important thing, being the recipies, are a must have! I bought it for my mom for her birthday (and my mom has every cook book in the world). I am constantly finding the perfect course or side dish to add for just the right touch. If you like being creative and trying your own hand at modifying recipies you'll be pleasantly surprised. Try adding Lemon to the Artichoke, Chicken and Chive soup - it's SO good."
2,Not typical for California,I got the book in the mail today and disappointed as the book left out alot of typical California recipes. I lived in California all my life and this is missing some good ol Tri Tip recipes that the centeral coast is known for. Some good recipes but not what I was looking for. Had trouble connecting with these recipes not what I was use to cooking all my life.This seems to be high end cooking with things I've never heard of. Having said that I am willing to try new things and will try some. It just isn't California typical for me Sorry wouldn't recommend for the one looking for a down to earth California cook book. No pictures either. I'm going to check out a different book. Maybe Best of the Best from California.This Maybe a good cookbook with the wrong name. I am looking for down to earth California cooking.
1,Rustic Hanging Cedar Loveseat Swing,"The swing arrived with huge cracks along the whole length of several members. The cracks were wide (~1/4""), deep (~1"") and long (longest 44 1/2""). The cracks were not only very unsightly, and probably compromised the structural integrity of the unit, but also represented safety issues, as a child's finger could easily fit in the crack and possibly cause injury. When I contacted the seller, CSN, they were no help at all claiming repeatedly that the swing was not defective and the cracks were a normal part of seasoning the wood. They agreed to take the unit back but wanted to keep $28 for S&H. Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue and reimbursed me the $28. Stay away from this piece of junk and stay away from CSN."
5,Highly Underrated Movie!,"I am writing this review to correct a previous reviewer. Instead of discussing the pros and cons of this movie ""laddie5"" simply engaged in a character assassination of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Having actually seen this movie, I can tell you that it is definitely a good one--and also highly underrated! The movie was well adapted from a novel by Vice-Admiral Charles A. Lockwood. In other words, the movie creates a very good image of what it was like on a WWII submarine. Furthermore, the acting is not stiff! The characters all really get into their roles and everything goes smoothly. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone and hope that my fellow reviewers will be more objective from now on."
3,"it's OK, but not too exciting.","This is one of those CDs where one songs makes it worth owning. The first track ""A estrada e o violeiro"" with Nara Leao is outstanding. The rest is fairly standard late 60s MPB, somewhat like Chico Buarque de Hollanda from the same period, but not nearly as charming, interesting...well, just not nearly as good, basically. It's by no means terrible, though."
4,Pros and Cons,"I own 3 printers. I love my all-in-one. It's so easy to use. Excellant product for the price. The downsides! Its big and doesn't fit on a standard PC desk. The photos I printed were not as pretty as the ones I print with my cheaper Lexmark Z715. So, I'm keeping that one for photos. I use my Z23 on my older (kids) PC. Lexmark printers are dependable and easy to understand. I don't know how customer service is because, I've never needed them.Lexmark does have a bad rep at work. Were constantly having problems with it. It's a larger business size. We recently got a refurbished one. I think the problem lies with my company being cheap and not with Lexmark products."
5,My Young Dear Friends,"As a DRE for HS students, I found it a refreshing and short spiritual exercise/prayer time to start each class. I agree with the previous review, and could be followed by a short session on a gospel reading.How more loving and powerful as spoken by Blessed Pope John Paul II, as a father to his children: ""Jesus is living next to you, in the brothers and sisters with whom you share your daily existence.""I would recommend this book to every HS CCD class or Youth Meetings."
4,Good dvd but could have been better!,I am a fan of mario cartoons but I would say the super mario world cartoon was way better than the originals. I mainly bought this dvd for the two bonus zelda cartoons and it was worth it. The Sonic series is way better that tristar also offers on dvd!
2,Commentary? What Commentary?,"Overall, the DVD is decent, but without live action sequences, its missing quite a bit. As it is, it's a very barebones release.I don't know why, but I haven't heard the commentary... where/when is it?"
4,"Great movie, but arrived in a broken case","I absolutely love this movie; it's fantastically beautiful and inspiring...but I almost didn't get to see it. When it arrived, still sealed in the layers of security tape and plastic, there were obviously broken pieces inside the case as it sounded like a baby's rattle. I was nervous the DVD was broken or scratched, but thankfully once I finally managed to get it open, it revealed only the little button that holds the DVD had broken off in a few pieces. This could have really scratched up the DVD, but it seemed okay and played fine.I gotta say that disappointed me. I mean, how the heck does that happen?? The DVD exterior case wasn't even cracked. How'd the manage to break an interior part?"
4,Beautiful Book,"I saw this book after looking at three of the author's other books (A Year in Chocolate, Bittersweet, and Cookie/Bars). Surprising, I found my experience with this one to be a bit deflated. It does have beautiful photographs for just about all of the desserts and this is very much appreciated. However, I have seen much of these same recipes in Bittersweet, so this book was a bit of a let-down. I was also annoyed by the author's descriptions of her life experiences in this first book...somehow she appeared self-absorbed, and this was evident even in her last book, Bittersweet- so apparently this might suggest a pattern.Still, she obviously knows her stuff when it comes to chocolate and all of her books are good. I actually have enjoyed the cookie book the most so far. I hope to get a chance to see the one on low-fat desserts. Cocolat is worth a look."
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,"I paid $19.26 for two of these. My nine month old puppy had it chewed to pieces in less than an hour. I could not believe my eyes when I saw orange chunks of rubber all over the floor. She ate some of it as I saw when she threw up. The pieces were large enough to be a choking hazzard.It is now in the garbageI was reading the paper, and she was just a few feet away. I agree with the person who wrote something like ""If your dog has teeth,this is not the toy to order"". Believe it! None of us can afford to throw our money away like I just did. Very poor choice. Irene Briggs"
2,Not so tough,">It is a tug , chew , teething and flying toss toy...We have 11 months old female pit bull. She enjoyed the toy so much that she punctured the ball twice within 5 minutes. So if you have a vigorous chewer I would not recommend this toy. Luckily it's still usable, but I hate that I have to supervise her while she's playing with it."
4,Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"I have always loved this movie. Saw it when I was young and watched it all the time (thanks to a TV taped copy) on rainy days. My review, then, is for the packaging and special features and whatnot. As for the packaging, it's kinda plain. Nothing really stands out, just a disk and a scene guide. This does balance, though, with the deleted scenes and other features. Overall I'm happy but not blown away, thus the 4 stars."
5,Yay fast shipping,Well the movies a gift and I actually haven't seen it but I've heard it's hilarious! I also bought this like a day go so the shipping was super fast! Yay!
1,"It's not yet known,but this may not be any different from the last time it was on DVD",It's august '08 and this movie came out a few years ago on DVD. Why should there be a new release? Should there be a new release? There's no special features to show as of the time of this review. If you all ready own a copy don't waste your money.
1,Unwatchable,"This film made me physically sick. Peewee has a grating personality and the jokes were... well... uninspired at best. Skip it and watch something funnier... like paint drying or the teletubbies.I must admit, I only got through the first 25 minutes before I had to turn it off. Maybe the last hour transcended the first part, but I wouldn't put a wager on it."
4,It's still good.,If you were a fan of Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Pee Wee's playhouse in the 80's this is still funny after all these years. It's silly cheap humor. I watched it with my wife and in-laws at their request and we laughed at the silly bits remembering the movie from 25 years ago. Thanks Amazon for including the digital copy to watch instantly.
5,listen to the commentary,"In my top 5 favorite movies of all time! Listen to burtons commentary to understand why scenes were changed or deleted for the Dvd release. The deliberate gaffes in the theatrical version are sorely missed, but they don't take away from the unironic, child- like glee of this unique celebration of stunted adulthood."
5,OMG,"I really,really liked it! At first didnt mainly cause i wasnt in the mood for another millionaire wants girl till he tires of her type story, but it was so well written i could actually feel their emotions. Your going to adore Father Tomas, oh and for those of you who are interested the sex was okay too, i liked the fact that it wasnt graphi,but still sexy."
4,Good product but bad packaging,Very good item. Do not expect too much although.This toy is between lego and usual simple toy. Where lego is the best.You and your child can play it 3-4 times a week. It is better than other simple toys. With simple toy you can expect good child's play once a week or two. With lego your child will play everyday.Magna-Tiles is nice lookin greate toy especially if you're tired of watching your child play in Lego4 stars for bad packaging. There are no any soft matirial in parsel. And this toy can easely be broken somewhere on half way to customer. I suggest seler to take time and effort to better pakaging. Especialy when send somethin abroad.
4,Amazing pleasure for the 3+ child,"My granddaughter on her 3rd birthday received a flood of cute, flashing, singing, tuneful toys. And finally there came this set of 100 magnetic tiles, which she instantly started working with, and that was it for the rest of the day. They're not cute or flashing, they make no noise, but they turn out to be perfectly captivating. And oh yes, I found my own sweet 70 year old self down on the floor playing with them as well !"
5,love these tiles!,"This is definitely a pricey set, but we have had so much fun with them, it is totally worth it. I am very happy that we decided to get the 100 piece set. My 3.5 year daughter has had a great time building houses, trains, rockets, etc etc, and I must admit, I think I am having nearly as much fun as she is!"
3,Magnatiles online information missing,"My 3 stars are only meant to indicate that the ad for this product, 100 piece box of Magnatiles, does not have sufficient information for the buyer. It is an expensive item, and yes, it does have 100 pieces, but only 54 of the pieces are the kind of squares most useful for building structures. The rest are various shaped triangles, much less useful, especially for young children. Since the buyer has no way of knowing this information, or knowing the sizes of the pieces, it is a risky purchase. Magnatiles are a GREAT toy, but they are expensive and the purchaser should know up front what types of pieces and their sizes are inside. This is one great weakness of buying toys on amazon.com"

3,So it was the Germans?,"The author's only objective is putting forward the idea that it was the Germans who were responsible for the victory at Waterloo and the ultimate demise of the French.Ok. Based on this kind of thinking it was the French who won the War of American Independence as without their timely involvement the Americans would have been forced to call it day; and it was the Americans who won World War 1 as without their participation the Allies would not have had enough men for a final push.More respect should be given to those nations represented and the men who fought and died. Waterloo was won by the Allies, as plain and simple as that!"
5,Just Priceless,"I could go on all day about everything I've learned from this book. I wasn't sure what to expect exactly, but I sure wasn't disappointed. I had the chance to exchange a couple of emails with Tari shortly before she left us and I am grateful for this. She was a wonderful person and this is her legacy to all LDS parents who homeschool, consider homeschooling as a possibility or are planning to homeschool for sure. Whatever your situation, this book is a must-have for all and the very best place to start, truly.The cover seems to have changed a little, has been updated it seems, which would mean that more have been printed out and that's good news. Don't wait another day!"
4,Too short.......,"The CD is too short at 45min for such a price. I believe they could have added in at least a few bonus tracks. And just what do they mean by ""Enhanced CD""? No doubt, the tracks are remastered, but I haven't found anything special(programs,video clips,etc.) on the CD that would deem it ""Enhanced""."
3,Interesting,"This book was a good and interesting read. Nothing was really expected, which was good. It kept me reading, obviously."
2,Slow as slow can be,"I didn't like it, is all I remember about it. I've been reading mysteries a long time and I can't remember anything about the book. Perhaps the story just went on too long with not much happening. Sorry I can't be more specific."
4,Great read!,This was my first of the Joe Gunther series and after reading it wont be my last. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Believable characters and storyline. When I read a book I sometimes imagine it as a movie.....this would be perfect.
3,A decent story line...not quite riveting.,"I read lots of cop books and am former PD. The best stories stick to real details and unpredictable turns. This is a very good attempt, with decent characters, just needs some polish. I will read more from this author though."
3,Worth the read,"It's not an amazing page turner, but it's not bad. Kind of dragged in a few places. Doesn't really entice me to read more of the Joe Gunther series, but we'll see. But for a free book, it's not bad. Of course all that said, it might have been b/c I was hit with a bad case of appendicitis (& surgery) in the middle of reading it that I didn't love it. ;)"
5,great read,"takes me back to the lovely land of the green mountains and all her unforgettable character types, some of whom are here."
5,Super,I love this series. It is fast paced and well written. I read many books and this was one of the better.
4,Good Book,"This is the first one I've read by the author. The quality of the writing improved over the course of the novel and was as good as anything I've read from James Lee Burke, Crais, etc. The descriptions were extremely well-balanced and taut. He did veer into the police procedural aspects of the plot more than I would have liked - who is in charge of what - and conflicted with the straight narrative.I look forward to reading more in this series. Well done."
4,3 1/2 Stars - Enjoyable but not Memorable,"This is the first in the series about Joe Guther, a police lieutenant in Brattleboro, Vermont. The story does very well in portraying life in Vermont and the politics in a small city in which everyone has to answer to someone.The character development is well done and the love interest aspect is satisfying. There are a plenty of subplots, maybe too many, but the overall story is inventive without being too complicated. However the various successful developments of solving the mystery do seem to be very conveniently available.The solution is more of following the dots than putting the pieces of the puzzle together to get the big picture, the way most police solve crimes.Better than the average crime novel but if you read 1-3 a week, you might have trouble remembering much about the book 2 weeks after finishing it."
1,not worth the time!,"Open Season is a mystery/armchair thriller featuring a middle aged & widowed detective, Joe Gunther. The story is told in the first person, and unfortunately Joe narrates endlessly about himself and the other characters... with the plot little more than a footnote. Which definitely makes for a boring and slow read. Even then, the mystery plot was so twisted and bizarre that I could not force myself to keep reading.I should of known after reading the author's note at the beginning that this was going to be a desperate attempt at a first novel, and that was very clear in just the first few pages. I just wish the author would of spent less time in character development, and more time in plot development & accuracy."
3,Dull,"When I say ""dull"", I don't mean ""boring"" necessarily; I mean not sharp. I felt that it was slow reading, without anything that grabbed me and made me rush to turn the page. I know that sounds odd, given that we're talking about a story focusing on a wrongly imprisoned man, a character bent on revenge, and numerous chase scenes. But I was never excited about anything that was going on. It was like everything was moving in slow-motion. Structurally, the writing was competent, but I didn't connect with any of the characters and the ending was a great disappointment to me, for reasons that I won't go into so that I don't spoil it for anyone else. I really cannot recommend this book."
3,interesting but confusing,"Open Season overall was a decent book. Read it because it was free from Kindle store. It was a pretty fast read, with that being said it was confusing at points. It took awhile to get the characters down, even in the end, I wasn't sure who they were chasing and who they already pinned crime on. Of course, this hasn't stopped me from adding other books from the series to my wishlist because I do indeed enjoy the character of Joe Gunther."
2,Stick to the plot,"What started out as a good mystery soon turned into a boring soap opera. I really enjoyed the initial scenes with the crime and investigation, but then the author transgressed into boring characterizations which had nothing to do with the story. It got slower and slower until I put it down."
4,GOOD BOOK,"THIS WAS MY FIRST ARCHIE MAYOR BOOK. IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH, THAT I BELIEVE THATI WILL READ OTHERS. GIVE IT A TRY, THINK THAT YOU WILL LIKE IT TOO."
5,Great book.,"Loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Tons of action, perfect. Hope the rest of the series is this good."
4,Solid plot mystery,"Interesting, unorthodox, refreshing plot. Keeps you engaged till the end. Nice, close to ""Noir"" atmosphere. Almost real life characters. Very precise movie quality descriptions of places (might be too precise for some readers). Omnipresence of Ski Mask not very believable."
4,found a new author,"I love Kellerman, Diehl, Patterson, and now I have a new author to love......my husband and I have a house in vermont and to read a story with references to places we know are exciting"
1,absolut horrible quality and workmanship,"I bought two of this, same format different print.this headband is really below any standard. the sewing is outside! Where you can see it, usually you sew inside and turn the thing inside out. the material is absolutely a joke. flimsy as hell.the cloth is cut in waves...the whole thing looks like the person who did the cut had a hard night....all in all stay as far away as you can"
5,Perfect background music for entertaining,"This is my first CD of this artist. The music is great, and the more I listened to it the more I love it.We had a party this past summer in our back lawn, and I played this CD, receiving numerous positive feedback from our guests...""Who is that? That is great music!""I love the romantic, take-me-away, Latin rhythms of smooth, easy, jazz guitar.Looking forward to trying another of Marc's selections."
5,A smooth and melodic Jazz treat,"I was very eager for the release of guitar great Marc Antoine's "" Mediterraneo"", his first on Dave Koz's label , Rendezvous Entertainment. The album retains Antoine's melodic Spanish flavor while on some tracks he uses horns to mix in a straight jazz sound. Tracks such as ""Senor Groove"" and ""Funky Picante"" are up-tempo groove pieces that show off Antoine's incredible picking ability and true musicianship. On other more romantic tracks such as ""Lady"" and ""Alejandro's Lullaby"" Antoine gives classic Latin beats dreamy qualities. Overall this album is an amazing fusion of haunting Latin sounds and cool contemporary jazz, and reaffirms Marc Antoine's place as one of the most talented musicians in world/jazz music."
4,Love the CD...especially Funky Picante,"My original plan was to purchase the Funk Picante single but after sampling other songs, I decided to purchase the CD. I'm happy with my decision."
1,Rio de really bad,You know how sometimes you get sucked into seeing peoples bad videos of their trips - well that is what you are seeing in this one. Not helpful at all. ONe moment where there are some nice fireworks but not worth watching the whole thing for. WIsh I had read the other reviews before I bought it.
3,Great but only a fading glory,"This is the last NR Lp I ever bought. This one was a great listen when it came out, but it lacks something. The previous releases had an energy, a spark that made every listen worth while. This Lp still has many memories for me. The only time I ever saw them live they played in Austin, Tx with Jawbox in 1991. They were great live and to this day that remains one of the best live bands I ever saw. Sadly though, this release in retrospect lacks everything the others had. I pull it out from time to time to see if my opinion has changed, but sadly it has not."
1,Cruel humor.,"Did Kate Bush authorize the use of her photograph on the cover of this book? If she did, all I can to say is, ""Shame on you!""If this book is supposed to be humorous then it's cruel humor, directed at the obese, anorexic, and mentally ill in our society. The main character in this novel is so mentally ill he wants to commit suicide. Suicide is never funny.If Kate Bush has no knowledge of this, then it's unfortunate her name and face are being used to help sell this novel."
5,Tree Frog Webkinz rating,We gave the Tree Frog Webkinz to our granddaughter for Christmas. I love the real looking tree frog. She collects frogs and it was perfect.
4,Ideal for frog lovers,Got this for a friend. It's her second one. She wore her first one out after dragging it around for a few years. Very cute
5,the genesis of good books..,"This book is a detail guide for people learning to use the GEneral NEural SImulation System, one of the best softwares for computational neuroscience. The presentation is clear enough for everyone, but it would be much helpful if the readers have a basic backgound on neuroscience and programming language C. Useful exercises are provided at the back of most chapters so readers can make practices immediately.I think this book should be recommended to undergraduates studying neuroscience. There are many books in the field of neural biophysics and modeling. Students usually find it boring and not easy to comprehend. But this book accompanies a simulation software in the CD-ROM, using which students can easily control and visualize the electrical behaviour of a neuron. This provides a chance for interactive education and should become a great help to their studies."
3,Not quite comprehensive enough,"The book arrived fine, in very good used condition. I had wanted it to get information on the nephrotoxicity of various antioxidants, and it wasn't specific enough for that, but that was not the fault of the seller."
3,Another Classic from Ertl,I have this model and it's the blue one offered a few years ago. Tha model is very good as a collector but not as a toy. The small part issue holds true. Be careful when the little ones look at or handle this one. Looks good next to all my other Olds models. This one really shows how REAL cars were made back in the 1950's
