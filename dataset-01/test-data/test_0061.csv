4,One of My Favorites!,I had this video as a kid. I watched it over and over! There are many great Silly Songs on here from early Veggie Tales and they are so fun to sing along with. I bought this copy for my niece and I know she will love it as much as I did.
2,This CD needs sub-titles the audio is so bad,I grew up on Clancy Brothers LPs and very much looked forward to this CD when I saw it in the store. BIG Mistake ! When I first played it I thought the CD player was broken. then I thought I was going deaf then I realized that the audio on here can only be heard with equipment rented from the CSI team.As to the song selection I would say that some the best of the Clancys are here but many of the songs I never heard of before and am not sure how they got in a favorites album.
2,Too much is too little,I am disappointed in this CD from one of my favorite groups. The over all quality of the product is poor. The volume goes up and down without warning. There are too many songs and they are too short.I own other Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem CDs. This is one I can not recommend.Spend your money on something else.
1,Cheaply Made,"I tried this knife at Sur La Table at the Furi demo. They appeared to be very sharp. However I did not like these knives for the following reasons1) I dont care much for the cheap plastic-like orange handles2) The finish on the knives appear to be cheap. Furi implies that these knives are made in Germany. However they are cheaply ""Made in China"". Now generally I dont care that much .. everything is now made in China anyways.. But when I am paying so much money for a product, I was hoping it was made in Germany or USA.3) The case is even more cheaply made.Personally, I would wait for a sale on the Global or the Wustof knives."
3,Realistic Looking,"The pizza LOOK real. My kids have enjoyed playing it and it is challenging to see the difference in size when the marked side is hidden. Not sure it's what I was looking for, but at least the kids seem to like it."
1,Cosmic Wheels,I thought I had ordered the original LP equal (like everyother CD with the same name as the LP I have purchased)This is not the original & will be returned.Original playlist on 1973 Epic LPCosmic Wheels - Earth Sign Man - Sleep - Maria Magenta - Wild Witch Lady - The Music Makers - The Intergalactic Laxative - I Like You - Only the Blues - Appearances
2,This isn't Cosmic Wheels!,"OK, the title cut is here, but where is the rest of the original album? I wasn't expecting yet another compilation album!"
5,Lucy Desi Comedy Hour,"I own all 6 Lucy Seasons and Seasons 7-9, which are also known as the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (I think they should have it titled as this to avoid confusion).The artwork has changed since I bought my copy but the product has not...There are some really great episodes any Lucy fan would not want to miss on these discs! From alaska to hunting for uranium to lucy and the mustache, all of the episodes are great, but my absolute favorite is where they go to Japan! Fried Grasshoppers anyone? Not for Lucy, she just wants pearls.I HIGHLY recommend getting Seasons 7-9! These are Hour long episodes that some people don't even know exist or think they are 30 min episodes, like Seasons 1-6."
5,Better than Expected,"I expected the flag set to be good, but it was much better than I expected. It came well packaged, no damage, complete, with instructions, and shipped quickly. I gave my brother one for Christmas and kept one for myself."
3,Twisted Animation From the Van Beuren Studio,"Van Beuren was a B-grade animation studio in the Max Fleischer vein. Regardless of the tight budgets, Van Beuren produced some bizarre and truly memorable cartoons during the early 1930s - particularly those featuring the musical antics of Tom and Jerry. ""Cartoons That Time Forgot"" includes some of the duo's best shorts: ""Piano Tooners,"" ""Wot a Night"" and ""The Tuba Tooter."" Another minor classic is ""The Sunshine Makers"" (1935) in which cheerful dwarfs conquer grim-faced gremlins with bottles of sunshine. Unfortunately, Van Beuren's misguided attempts to emulate Disney and resurrect Felix the Cat fall flat. Though an uneven collection, this DVD has several underrated gems worth seeking out."
2,Let It Be........and don't buy,"Illistrated lyrics my a$*....Personally, I was a bit dissapointed with this book. Let me get one thing straight, I do love art, paintings, drawings etc, but this book is full of the most obscure pictures of random things that are totally irrelevent to the song, let alone depicting the lyrics.Don't get me wrong, I am absolutly mad about the Beatles and there music, the lyrics and songs, and of course their handsomely good looks (hehe) , but this book just made it seem like someone took a whole bunch of meaningless doodles by un-notorious 'artists'and stuck them beside imagary, story telling lyrics. If you want to learn background about the beatles' songs, this book will take you nowhere . However, if you ARE looking for some unattractive illistrations and incorrect lyrics to beatles songs, you've found your match. So before you buy, think about it....LET IT BE for your own sake, and your wallet's"
3,Oh well what can I say ...,"'Rosa Fielding: Victim of Lust' 126 pages in length, is a story about young, nubile Rosa, who is sent out of the village into London by Mr Bonham, a widowed wealthy elderly man, so that she may be educated and prepared for marriage to him. Unfortunately, Bonhams' engaged ... daughter sees a fly in the ointmentshould her father marry a girl younger than her and, maybe cut her out of her well calculated and expected inheritance ....This book is OK but wins no prizes in Victorian erotica as far as I'm concerned ...."
5,kirkland complete chewable vitamins,The product was very good and here very quickly. I have always been happy with amazon purchases.
2,Lacks Depth,"I agree with all of you who take into account the fact that Ashanti wrote these poems when she was in High School, however, I was in high School when I read it and was apalled at her skills. How can such a great song writer be such a terrible poet? It didnt make sense to me because I equate both those processes to be one and the same. I found her skill at writing these poems minimal, most of her content childish and amateurish. They lacked not only alot of emotional depth, but maturity.Granted Ashanti is no Maya Angelou, but she's not an elementary school kid either, that is, it is the level her work can be compared to. I felt like I was reading the work of a fourth grader, if it wasnt for the content.I love Ashanti, but I dont love this work. It just seems like people in her PR dept thought it was a good idea to put out something like this to capitalize on her popularity. Nothing but a ploy to make more bucks! Don't waste your money or better yet, check it out from the library."
1,...MAKES JEWEL LOOK LIKE THE POET LAUREATE,"I could think of only one explanation for why Ashanti thinks she's written a book: she probably hasn't read one before. This is a scam, to put it mildly. There are no ""poems"" here, and I think it prudent to note that there are no REFLECTIONS either. Yeah, Ashanti remembers a bunch of ludicrious high school crap, but she seems to have learned only one lesson, which could have easily been brought across in one sentence: ""Damn, I had a lot of boyfriends!""In addition to the inane anecdotes, there are her horrendous ""lyrics,"" characterized by her marked inability to rhyme. I think this book would be fine if it was a prom magazine insert, but as it stands it is a rip-off."
4,Great read!,This book is a good and quick read. It's a great read for a book club and for young teen girls searching for true love.
2,Very Mediocre,"I checked out this book because I was searching for the hidden talent to back up the tremendous hype Ashanti has been receiving. Perhaps I could find it in her ""phenomenal"" writing skills. Yet, just like her songs, her poems lack sophistication and depth. They are always about the same old topic: ""ups and downs of love."" She might as well put her song lyrics (from her debut album) in the book and called it poetry. The grammar and the structure of the stanzas seem to reflect ""elementary school"" level poetry. Despite my negative comments, I must give her credit though for having the courage to publish her poetry. All she needs is a bit more inspiration and maturity in order to become the true artist she was meant to be. She has wonderful potential, unfortunately, its being channeled in the wrong direction."
1,Not what I expected,I happen to like Ashanti CD but I do not like her book at all. It talks about love but it's nothing really deep all she talks about is how she used to talk on the phone with her boyfriend all the time. This book is not at all what I expected. Please do not write anymore books please stick to writting half way decent songs on your CD and singing.
4,Internet Activities for Social Studies,"This is an awesome book to use in conjunction with other social study texts. We used the Viking section for part of our US History. For us, it made history more interesting because it wasn't all reading a hardbound book but ""playing "" with the computer as well - computer skills and history! Can hardly wait for a U.S. History one!"
4,Great!!!!,"My first initial review of observing the gold endless earrings is that they were a little thin from what I expected. However, they are large and it has a beautiful shine. Having slanted eyes these gold endless has really emphasized on bringing out my eyes and I LOVE IT!! Delivery was prompt and they consistently kept me updated about the shipment via email. I'm really happy with this purchase. The closure is definitely a plus."
1,Very Bad DVD Mastering,"Do NOT buy this movie. It says 'Widescreen', but it is not anamorphic. This means that it shows very badly on my 16:9 screen, there's not only black bars on the top & bottom, but also on the left & right. In fact, there's more black on the screen than movie. Very bad and a waste of money."
4,Must see for McQueen fans!,"Watching this movie one sees exactly what the big deal is about Steve McQueen. Only McQueen could give such an easy presence on the screne. His performance as a typical American is worth all the other excellent performances in this film combined. There is not an actor today that conveys the respect and admiration that he is able to through his characters. As far as the movie is concerned, it was not memorable. Don't get me wrong, the plot, story, and acting are all great. As a WWII movie goes this is excellent. However, others have been done better (Dirty Dozen, Private Ryan). It is McQueen's and everyone elses performances that make the film worth seeing."
4,GREAT MOVIE,BE SURE YOU CHECK THAT YOU HAVE ORDERED THE PROPER REGION I DID NOTI NOW HAVE A REGION 2 AND CANNOT USE IT
2,Forget this: Complete Score Available,"This is a very truncated version of the soundtrack, essentially the original 1963 record album. Because LPs could hold only so much music, different versions of the cues were used and much of the music is not here. the complete score is available on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Escape-Complete-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B004JO44T6/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0 which is a 3 CD set that also includes this original album."
4,Entertaining war yarn,"This is one of the best yarns ever made based on WWII, taut screenplay, great acting, no sidetracking heroines and not a dull moment. I am surprised at some negative reviews calling it a 'joke' and such. The movie is an entertainer. If you want serious stuff related to the Holocaust go watch Schindler's list and hundreds of other documentaries made. The movie does what it is supposed to do, entertainment with an underlying conscience/awareness attached of the seriousness of the basic story."
5,Kaua'i Obake Bar Reviews,"Classic. The kind of movie you pull out on a gray foggy day, pour three fingers of a good whisky into a glass, and settle in to watch. Definitely not a one-character movie."
3,GREAT STORY - BAD ASPECT RATIO & VIDEO,This is a great movie about a great story but the DVD offers up poor video on a widescreen set and awful aspect ratio on a regular TV set.
5,"""How many are you planning to take out?""","The only war movie that makes you want to sign up for the British army the minute the credit's roll. All-out action, an unbashed, translantic ensemble cast ( Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, James Coburn, Donald Pleasance,) and a thrilling final reel make it the most entertaining escape movie ever made."
4,A very good road companion,"The new Rand McNally Road Atlas gives me all the information I need to drive from one place to another. As a matter of fact, there are roads shown in the Atlas which are not shown on other maps or even on the AAA Trip-Tiks. I actually contacted Rand McNally to make sure that the road shown on the map actually existed and was passable, and the lady I spoke with gave me details about what the street name was, and how that street name changed 3 times when you travel the road. I certainly didn't expect that kind of excellent service, but I got it. And knowing about the road, cuts about 50 miles off my trip.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I feel there is too much information in the Atlas, other than road maps. So, it is a larger document than I feel it needs to be.The ring binding is a real plus too, as it makes the Atlas simpler to use."
4,2 into 1; You can't beat that.,"For action movie fans, this is one of the best 2 discs DVD sets you can buy. Each of the 2 discs has the same movie on both sides: one for NTSC and one for Widescreen. Each of the movies has good picture and good digital sound. The films are full of action, drama, and romance. The DVD menus are incredible; each disc is like it's own single independent disc but this is a 2 discs DVD set. 2 into 1; you can't beat that."
2,Death by Family,So far this book is killing me.Hopefully it will get better. It can't get much worse.I am learning a lot of good information. But it is pulling teeth to get it.
1,Won't do it again,"These looked beautiful from the pictures and the price was fantastic! As soon as I took them out of the package, I could feel that they were poor quality. They aren't silky, so they don't hold form well. They easily tear and snag. It's like a one-time-wear item. I'm throwing them away."
2,My mistake,The unit is obviously reconditioned and does not have all features of the original unit operational. Many CD's will not play on this unit but do play well on another DVD player which is very basic. This purchase was a mistake on my part but it plays commercial DVD's and tapes plus home recorded tapes.
5,EXCELLENT,"An excellent movie about what we can do with the help of God. Mormons will enjoy the whole missionary aspect of the film, and non-Mormons will not be put off by any ""preaching"". Though this is a film about a Mormon missionary if you don't pay attention you may not even realize he is Mormon. He's just a guy trying to do God's work. LOVED IT."
1,If you care about sound quality...,The mastering on this disc is so distorted that it renders the product unlistenable.
5,Grimms Fairy Stories,"""Grimms Fairy Stories"" is as interesting as the New Show ""Grimm"". The stories are amazing and the art is good too. The Free Audio book was an appreciated bonus. I didn't realize how many stories they had written."
1,Outdated and Tedious,"This book sports a 2006 copyright, but appears to have been researched and written from 1996 to 2002. The information and positions taken were effectively 4 years out of date when published and this makes reading the book both frustrating and tedious. Can't recommend."
4,I like the song,"I only heard the song Last Kiss and I love it, it's a great song, I like it that the song is sad but the music is very happy. I also like the Pearl Jam version. When I was in the USA last year I heard the song all the time. Good Times"
3,Usable,"It is easy to use and enter stamps, Documentation is lacking and only helps for setup and to get you started entering stamps. There is a lot more you can do with this software. By trial and error I have been able to add more info on the stamps and its release history. There are many reports you can choose from, or create a report of your own, but no instructions on how to do so. I feel someone who knows Microsoft Access will not have any problems creating any report. My software never updated last year at all even though it would search for updates, it would look for the 2011 version and not the 2012 version."
1,Zero support,"Lack of support and totally non-responsive to emails. Even made the forum webpage inaccessible so other users can't share their learnings. The software contains numerous errors in stamp images and descriptions, and is missing a ton of stamp images that you need to scan in on your own. Too much work to deal with. Don't bother with it."
3,Grimek vs Reeves,"I noticed that at least two reviews have comments about the 1949 Mr. USAContest which was awarded to JohnGrimek with Clarence Ross 2nd andSteve Reeves 3rd.Although I wasn't there and thiscompetition occurred before I waseven born, what's the point ofarguing over a competition that tookplace over 50 years ago?So what if the fans booed Grimek offthe stage...bodybuilding contests area matter of taste and personalpreference.As for the book, it was interestinto get the facts about York Barbelland Bob Hoffman and based on thisbook and in talking to some oldtimers in the sport, Hoffman did doit for ""his own ego"".Good book if you are into thehistorical aspects of the Iron game."
5,Fun and educational too,"As a teacher, I think this game is great for learning and practicing time. You can use it 2 ways: Showing a time on the pretend clock that is included or reading the analog time off of the clock. This feature can make the directions a little hard for children to understand, but once you explain that they choose one of these 2 play methods, it's really very easy for them. The 2 ways to play also make it multi-level which is great too."
5,The best shows for kids and adults!,"You just have to love Mister Ed he's funny, cute, and a TALKING HORSE! AND YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO LOVE HORSES TO LOVE ED!It is black and white so the picture and the pictures on the cove of the DVD are a bit misleading.But every one from the ages of 2 - 102 will enjoy it horse lover or not."
2,Mister Ed review from Down under,"The show gets top marks but the DVD lacks alot and is simply the early episodes not in any particular order presented in a standard sleeve.You may as well tape them off the cable rerunsIt is very frustrating when fans are clammering for extra information on their favorite TV shows and MGM can't provide some extras such as bloopers(now they would be funny)interviews, behind the scenes,biographies etc.Other annoyances are double sided DVDs-they are a pain but I accept them for packaging purposes.Also spare a thought for us poor folk outside the USA who have to contend with the region restrictions placed on this video-luckily I could find a DVD player that played all formats."
5,I thought the book was a very inspiring romance.,This book was awesome. I love the way Tracie and Judith create love stories that are based on Christ being the most important relationship. The love that the characters show towards one another is exactly how we as christians should consider and love others. They truly inspire me. I have read almost all of both Tracie Petersons' and Judith Pellas' books and they are all very good.
3,Not for me,"I have a short frizzy curly hair, and I need a product to boost it without the frizz look, its help a little to boost the curls but the frizz still there"
4,with a moo moo here...,"Another great Melissa and Doug product for me to use with children with special needs birth to three (primarily 18-36 months). The only reason I didn't go with 5 stars is that the paper wears off around the edges after wiping (several times) with clorox or lysol wipes. This probably would not be an issue in a home environment, but I use my toys with several children in several home visits during the course of a day.I always recommend Melissa and Doug products to the families I work with."
2,Not for Chewers!!,I was very excited about buying these. My son loves magnets and I thought this would be a great way to teach him about animals. They are great looking BUT I wish they were more heavy duty. They are essentially a magnetic backing with a layer of wood in the middle. On top of that is a paper picture and a thin laminated plastic layer on top. Not good for kids who like to put things in their mouths. In a matter of moments without much effort at all he had chewed off the turtles face. Now I find myself trying to keep them away from him which no fun for him or me :(
2,Magnets are too weak!,"We bought a bunch of sets of M&D; magnetic animals, numbers and letters for our craft project. We made a quilt landscape and glued it to the metal sheet to make an 'animal park'. Imagine our disappointment when we realized that these magnets are too weak to hold the figurines through the thin fabric!All our craft work was for nothing, just because M&D; used very cheap magnets. Joy killers.They stick to the bare metal, but nothing else."
5,My toddler loves these,"What kid doesn't like playing with magnets on the fridge? These are great because there's so many, there's enough for our fridge and some on our washing machine so she can play with them while I'm doing laundry. You can't beat Melissa & Doug for quality. They are durable (solid wood) and are fun. This is a great gift for a 1-year-old's birthday."
3,Not For Everyone,"This is a great value set for hardcore fans of Vincent, but will be of little interest to new comers. If you buy just one Gene Vincent cd get ""Rocks & the Bluecaps Roll/A Gene Vincent Record Date"" as it more straightforward rock and roll, has less ""filler"", and of course Be-Bop-A-Lula. Also check out the excellent rendition of Bluejean Bop on Paul McCartney's newest record Run Devil Run."
1,Poorly made lantern,"I purchased this based on previous ratings and was disappointed after getting the item. It came poorly shipped, not properly wrapped. The glass was broken in various places and the metal was not welded properly in all places, on top of that the glass didn't fit properly into the metal sections, so even if it were packed right, it would still be worthless, very poor cheap product. Gave it 1 star, because I coudn't post this without doing so, but doesn't deserve a rating at all."
3,A Little Self Serving,"I really like this book until I got to the chapter about Wing Bowl. Heavy Kevy and El Wingador should never be mentioned in the same book as Wilt Chamberlain, Mike Schmidt, and Chuck Bednarik. Adding Wing Bowl into this book seemed to be less about Philly Sports Fans, and more about promoting a WIP event. The chapter's tile is; Wing Bowl: The Ultimate Philly Event. No guys, it's a WIP event. Let's leave it at that."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book lives up to the title in that it certainly is little. That's the only positive aspect of it. The few techniques described were worthless - they actually are harder than just using correct millinery techniques. A significant amount of space was wasted on illustrations of tacky end-products in the gist of ""HAY! U CAN DECORATE YOUR HAT THIS WAY! BUT WAIT! IT LOOKS DIFFERENT IF YOU ADD A LACE RUFFLE!"""
1,broken,"This product has the worst motor I've ever experienced in any of my son's toys. The motor seemed to implode the very first day we had it. By the way, this is the story on our second toy. We had to return the original one because the motor came broken. The gear ""shaved off"" according to my 6 year old. Such a disappoinment. We're pretty bummed in this house. We're going to play with modeling clay instead."
2,Low quality,"Considering that high quality flags only cost twice as much, the ""World Cup"" flags are a waste of money. The only things good about the flags are the case and the light weight. These flags look better in the picture than in reality. They nylon material used is also thicker and less flexible than the ones used in higher-quality flags. I regret purchasing this product."
2,"Not the ""greatest"" NG photos","*AHEM* I don't see what anyone sees in this book. These photographs are NOT National Geographic's greatest! I have been a fan of NG ever since I was a child, always picking up the curiously bright yellow magazine and fliping through it to uncover stunning, magnificent photos and articles. Sadly, I must say that this book is a poor representation of NG's greatest photos. :("
2,Very small book!,"The pictures are beautiful, absolutely. However, check the dimensions---- it's about the size of my hand! It's not suitable as a coffee-table book sort of gift, which was the original purpose of my purchase. Unfortunately the small size detracts from the stunning beauty of the pictures. To maximize the size of the pictures, the images bleed to the edges of the pages--- giving them no visual frame. In a larger book this could be striking but in such a small book it's distracting. It's just too small to do the pictures justice. I'm keeping it on hand for an ""anytime"" gift (those last minute gifts you need which have to be generically suitable)."
3,"Fast shipping, great book!","Fast shipping, love the book, but the front cover was tattered on the edges. Thanks!"
2,Is Saudi-Arabia in Africa??,"I would underline what several reviewers pointed out about pictures and make (that's what the 2 stars are for), but I found that there are several serious errors in this book. One can find photos taken in Saudi-Arabia (pp222-223) or Israel(pp276-277) in the section about AFRICA! Hey, this is National Geographic--so far most reputable source of everything about our planet. The Middle-East and the Arabian peninsula are part of ASIA and not of Africa. I was astonished and very disappointed to see that the editors apparently didn't take care about these 'minor' issues."
5,Seeking sexual purity,"This book was helpful to me in that it taught the theory and helped me to understand why I was being tempted. This included spiritual attacks but also my own history and needs. It did help me find freedom from some specific temptations. However, it is best with another book that teaches the practical side and skills we need to develop. God does not do all the work :)"
3,They did'nt live happily ever after in this one:),"If your tired of all the unrealistic 'and they lived happily ever after' crap, this is it. This book is a spliff laced with hard reality. O'Flynn is a drunk Irish American Elephant hunter living in Mozambique, who crosses paths with the ruthless Askari in German Tanzania.This book is like a reminder that in life hapiness is always short lived. And he sets it up so well!If this is the first Wilbur Smith book you're gonna read, your not wasting your time.I give this book 3 stars just because I'm comparing it to other Smith books I've read. O.k, i'ts not his best, but It's still good.Get this experience under your belts kids, you won't regret it."
4,A deadly romp in Africa,"While this book is never likely to be counted among the classics, I don't really think the author meant it to be. The violence aside, I think he intended it as an amusing piece of fluff in the adventure genre, and that is certainly is.He has presented a colourful, overblown group of characters with little complexity, playing out an unlikely sequence of events in an exotic setting, well described. And it works. That can't be an accident.There's little depth here--in fact it stops just short of farce--but if you're looking for an entertaining read, I'd recommend it."
4,7,"A good western, a classic, and every one knows it. An incredible line of actors in a classic American Western and still enough to keep your attention even considering the age in which it was filmed."
4,The Best American Western Ever Made,"Because, of course, Once Upon a Time in the West (Should REALLY be on DVD) is Italian.Contains the greatest lines of dialogue in any Western (""It seemed like a good idea at the time."")A miraculous cast with stars galore from later years.Most importantly: The Alice Cooper Band wrote and preformed a brilliant homage to the Robert Vaughn character on their Killer album (should be available in the CD store) called Desperado. Watch the film, listen to the song. Nothing is better than mixing your media."
2,Exactly what I needed!,"Ok, this is not the highest quality product in the world. But for under $20, it was perfect. I needed to shuffle 50 decks of cards for an event I am doing next week.The shuffling was relatively good. Sometimes one side would run out of cards before the other, but that was not a problem. I shuffled each set of decks 3 times to ensure they were mixed up. This only took a matter of seconds.Sometimes some of the unshuffled cards would fall over the side (it would have been nice to have something there to prevent that) and some of the shuffled cards ended up on their side.I have no idea how durable it is. But it is exactly what I needed.UPDATE: I originally gave this 4 stars. But it died within 3 weeks. I downgraded it to 2 stars, although 1 might be more accurate."
3,Card shuffler,Got this product fast but it didn't work well until I glued the top middle piece. It was suppose to click into place but the sides were to spread out. After glueing the top piece it worked great.
4,Mr. G,"We love playing cards and our 4 Deck Automatic Card Shuffler for Blackjack is working great. It also provides a good place to store 4 decks when we are done, using the tray. I give it a top rating."
3,Lost in translation,"3.5 starsI found Thousand Cranes interesting, but a little hard to follow. Two of Kikuji Mitani's father's mistresses insert themselves into Kikuji's life. He falls for one of them, and later her daughter. A tea ceremony is central to the story, but it's meaning is a little lost on this Westerner. It's a short novel, but one I'm afraid I just didn't `get.'I also own Kawabata's Snow Country, which I still plan on reading at some point, but unfortunately I didn't find Thousand Cranes to be all that exciting.Thousand Cranes by Yasunari Kawabata, was first translated into English in 1958. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, and he died in 1972."
5,Beautiful Tone,"Outstanding performances of songs about or associated with New Orleans, played by cornetist Bob Barnard, pianist John Sheridan, and drummer Don Vickery. Mr. Barnard's cornet sounds clear and strong on the uptempo numbers while hinting at a softer honey-like tone on the slower ones. It's a beautiful fully matured sound that always captivates. John Sheridan stretches out and displays his mastery of the stride and swing idioms with a relaxed delivery that is unbeatable. The lesser known Don Vickery is just as fluent as his playing partners, whether he's on sticks or brushes.It's a splendid set of tunes played with eloquence and just a touch of melancholy that will stay with you long after the performance is over. Especially lingering is the tone of Bob's cornet. Beautiful."
2,Unsuitable as a Textbook,"This book appears to be an excellent *reference* in terms of extremely detailed aspects of parallel computing architectures.However, as a textbook, it falls far short. The information presented in the text is an extremely difficult read (from a format perspective). The sample problems presented in the body of the text bear little or no relationship to the exercise at the end of each chapter. This makes it difficult or impossible to relate the exercises back to the information presented in the chapter. Since there is no answer key, you're left guessing if you've correctly answered them.I find it baffling that anyone would use this text in a college classroom since it makes little or no effort to actually *teach* the material it presents."
3,not well written,"I think the book is not especially well written. Sentencesare long and in some cases unprecise or directly wrong.The book often does often not provide sharp and good definitions andit is not easy to extract the information contents, compared to many other books within this or related fields,for an example ""Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing""by Hwang and Briggs, or books by M. Morris Mano."
4,I hope it's the same book,"@school they pass around a book titled ""Call me Brick"". I assume this is the same book cited here. If so, it is regaled as a minor classic in adolescent porn. Lolita? ""Brick"" is a very pretty 12 year old redhead who seduces everything in her path. Her hunger for sex is boundless. For example, little Brick not only wants to screw a pilot, but it has to be at 30,000 feet - or no deal! Brick's path is play-called by a narrator dirty old man, ""Who want's an old bag fourteen?"" Brick is the toast of the town as the rich and powerful [...] line up for the chance to nail her. But Brick knows sex better than anybody. Brick is just twelve, but she also knows money. Softcore porn to be sure. Yet this bizzare novel is nearly impossible to put down as the reader wonders what pervision little Brick will think of next. I think it's teasingly wonderful!"
4,Bellydance Video,"I attend bellydance classes once a week and needed a guide for my home workout. The description of the video provided fit my needs and upon making the purchase, it arrived shortly and in excellent condition.Like my personal instructor, Jenna is EXCELLENT at describing how to execute each move for optimum muscle isolation and safety.I highly recommend this video for anyone interested in learning the art of bellydance."
5,an encylopedia of belly dance,This is a great instructional video. I have learned so much and have refined my technique. I would highly recommend it.
4,Fun fun fun,"Being uncoordinated as I am, I have found this to be a relatively easy dance video to follow. The explanations are clear and she demonstrates the moves. I would recommend it, especially if you are a beginner who has a rough time walking and chewing gum at one time"
5,If you only buy one bellydance video,I just got this dvd. WOW! Clear precise instruction. The instructor did not rush you through the basic movements like so many do. I wish I had gotten this one first. The other dvd's I've ordered in the past were nowhere near as helpful.
3,"Entertaining, to a point...","I enjoy Ms. McKinney's books but although this one started out with a bang I felt it ended on a fizzle. I felt oddly let down at the end, I can't quite put my finger on it, perhaps because, having read ""Lions and Lace,"" ***spoiler*** I wanted more ""reunion time"" between the sisters. Also, I felt the story descended into melodrama at times. But overall it was a diverting read worthy of a hot summer night, and a hunk of a cowboy worthy of a few good swoons!"
3,worth the price for the song i bought it for,"Do you remember is a very nostalgic song for me, so i was willing to pay up to $25. for it, thank God it cost nothing close to that. The cd is top quality, the group has real vocal skills, but the songs are rather boring."
5,K&N = MPG&HP,The price was competitive. I it cams on time. I love K&N filters I have them on all my cars. I got better MPG and a few more horse power with this filter. K&N nothing comes close.
3,Tina was a funny clown and a bombshell,Two words: Tina Louise... I don't think there is an american boy who watched Gilligans Island that didn't think she was anything but a bombshell - and she is an intense redhead.
1,Is this book a joke???,"I don't think this book was written from a realistic point of view, unless one wants to become an non-respectable self-centered slut with no friends, male or female. May I suggest Better Than Beauty, A Guide to Charm."
1,No good for same sex or non-traditional couples.,"The authors have a heteronormative outlook and do not address same-gendered couples. Moreover, the chapter on questions related to gender uses stereotypes of men and women. For example, ""He needs an attractive spouse"" is listed as a gender-based need experienced by men. As for women: ""She needs financial support"". If these sorts of gender roles appeal to you, then the book will reinforce your views; but for non-traditional couples and pro-feminists, I recommend avoiding it."
3,Super Reader,"After his Calbia escapade Doc learns in London, with the media highly intrigued as to why he is there. He doesn't like paparazzi any more than anyone else. He is soon involved in conflict some distance away by plane, with a gang, some men dressed in many little ugly head suits, and to top it all off, a whole passel of super spitting cobras."
2,"It is a ok cd. There are better ones, like men at work.","There are tons of bands like this. It is a good album, but i have listened to better."
3,nothing special,I agree with one of the preceding reviews. Substitute beagle or French poodle for boxer and you have 90% the same book. I was looking for a little more insight.
1,Way too thin!,"There's great reviews for the other colors and I agree with them, but Fiercely Fiona is just horrible. It looks pretty in the bottle, but it's so thin that I just couldn't get my nail fully covered regardless of how many coats I did. I ended up having to remove my nail polish and am now shelfing it for a year in the hope it thickens. I don't know if this is a problem with any other colors (I know that Who the Shrek Are You is fine), but this one is just no good. OPI, as much as I love you, this one is just a miss."
2,Not a good adapter!,"I ordered this adapter to use in my new Toyota Camry. The plug is too tight to fit into the sockets in my car. I forced the adapter into the socket in the dashboard and when I tried removing it back, it did not come out of the socket. Instead, the socket broke from the dash and the adapter came out with the socket and the wires from back damaging the dash.I have not had any problem with the car's socket. Infact I have been using the connectors in my GPS and Radar detector without any problem.Don't damage your car buying this cheap product."
1,Unusuable,I purchased this product to take with me on a road trip so that I could plug in 2 items. The springs inside kept pushing the plugs out so that it was unusable.
5,We can all identify with the stories in this book!,"Gina writes about every day life with open candor that makes you feel you are a part her family! Funny but also sensitive, I really enjoyed it.Life in the Bike Lane"
1,I think I cannot believe this expensive brand anymore,"I'm disappointed and dissatisfied with poor quality of those expensive Elixir acoustic guitar strings right at the first time I use. Once installed and picked for the 1st time, the open 3rd string made an uncomfortable buzzing sound when it reached to the correct pitch of G note. Moreover, the 4th string suddenly broke when being tuned up, even it had not reached to the correct pitch of D note yet. What a strange situation to me!Outside the box, W.L.Gore & Associates, Inc. advertise their Elixir strings: ""Great Tone, Elixir Strings LAST 3-5 TIMES LONGER than ordinary strings without compromising tone. This means you buy fewer sets of strings, change them less often, etc."" But my strings bought from them had problem and broke right at the first time installed. Now I think I cannot believe this expensive brand anymore."
5,Awesome Strings,These strings are very good! I've used them for years now. :-) I recommend these strings to all guitar players.
3,Edie for dummies,"Factory Girl was called by the Village Voice ""Edie for Dummies."" While not the first fictional attempt to show the Factory days of Warhol (see such films as The Doors and Basquiat), it presents what will become a standard historical (hysterical?) take on what happened there. Sienna Miller is okay as Edie, though where's the scar the real Edie had between her eyebrows? It showed that she was physically as well as psychologically damaged. I am also taken back by the way Dylan was treated, or should I say ""Musician""? Edie's brother claims that Edie aborted Dylan's baby, but there's no evidence that's true. Her affair was with Bob Neuwirth. And when Edie did Ciao Manhattan, the rambling, horrifying audio tapes she made about her life mention no abortion. She did have an abortion when she was 20, long before any of this. Altogether, Factory Girl doesn't really tell us very much, but it does give us a picture of that life."
1,A Snoozer,During the first hour I nodded off several times. It was just plain boring. I do not like a movie that tries to be artsy such as scenes where it changes to snowy black & white. All in all this was just a bad movie.
2,Sad exploitive story,The only thing I like about this movie is Sienna Miller and Val Kilmer acting out their roles. I think it's a shame that we have a need to immortalize someone's sad life and drug addiction.
5,I actually loved it!,"Ok, so I'm clearly not as big a fan of Edie Sedgwick as the other individuals who commented on this movie, but I am a HUGE fan of Andy Warhol!!! Even though this movie was not about Andy Warhol, I thought Guy Pierce did a fabulous job of portraying him. I read the philosophy of Andy Warhol before I saw this movie, and it really helped me understand it. If I didn't read it, I probably would not have understood half of what was going on. I also thought Sienna Miller did a great job of portraying what I knew about Edie Sedgwick. I am very very picky about what movies I like, and despite the other very critical reviews, I absolutely loved this movie, and I cannot wait to own it!!!!"
2,Poor little rich girl. A thin movie.,"I'm not sure Edie Sedgwick ever was well known beyond the confines of the New York underground art scene. If someone is truly a celebrity you really don't have to do your homework. It was said she was Andy Worhol's muse. More like his pigeon. She would do anything to be in his scene & was sucessful in that, becoming for a time, the ""It"" girl. She financed his Factory movie studio & collection of syncophants & oddball neurotics. She was rich & when she was broke & addicted, Warhol simply discarded her. She was breathtakingly beautiful as is Sienna Miller the actress who portrayed her. But that is a rather common commodity. If Edie had talent as an actress, we'll never know. Apparently she was the inspiration for the Warhol quote: ""In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes."" So she was. In the end she died like too many of the young, beautiful & stupid, by an overdose of heroin. So sad. Not very original, but dead nontheless."
5,Rainbows,"I ordered a bunch of shapes from this seller and find that this, the teardrop shape, is the best for creating dancing rainbow dots on my walls when the sun shines through.I've compared this crystal with the cheapest ones on [...]: those work for making light dots and chandeliers but don't make as strong rainbows. My friend says this is due to a certain glazing that the crystals on this page have. I have not compared these crystals with the really expensive brand-name ones (Swarovsky, etc.).This size, 38 mm, works well for hanging in front of windows with thread. They are quite light, so ordinary Scotch tape and a single thread can handle it.The 76mm teardrop crystals from this seller are also lovely and make larger rainbow dots, but those are too heavy for ordinary tape and eventually fall. For those I recommend doubling up the thread and attaching to the ceiling with gaffer's tape (expensive but such good tape). Also tie the thread to itself around the tape so that it can't slip out."
5,Positive lesbian movies,"Don't be confused by the box set, these are two different films that are beautifully directed. I bought this box set just a few days ago and immediately felt in love with it. This box set will left you wanting for more."
2,Big Time let down,"I was really excited by the idea behind this book- making learning about quantum physics interesting and entertaining. The problem was, the analogies were just too imprecise and seemed to muddle things up. I got incredibly bored with the book as things were never explained properly. The best part of the book is the little blurbs and notes at the end which actually explain what is going on. The actual content of the book just seems to confuse rather than explain."
1,"""Not so 'Bloody' good""","When I bought this double feature, my expectations were low. I sometimes adhere to the saying ""those who expect nothing will not be disappointed""; nevertheless, I was disappointed. ""Mortuary"" in particular was distressingly subpar, featuring Ms. Crosby of ""Next Generation"" fame slumming in this astonishingly low-rent production.""Bloody Mary,"" as indicated in the above title, was just bloody awful. This is really all the time I can dedicate to warning potential viewers of this dreck. Be warned!"
2,messy and overprized,"First of all, I'm not a dermatologist, I'm just a heterosexual guy with sensitive skin who has tried many products and done a lot of research in the search of the right products. I offer reviews of Clinique, zirh, menscience, art of shaving and baxter of California, hope my reviews are helpful.The art of shaving has to be my least favorite skincare product line. Their products are over prized, no samples or option of returning products if client is not satisfied is given.I prefer gels, this balm was too irritating and thick. the shave cream is great, so you really don't need it anyways"
3,Yet another dissipated album from NL,"This album is definitely not a worth of your money. I actually got this from the library expecting something better and more diversed from the NL family. After song #3, it's still the same old thang I been hearing album after album. There are two songs in this album that wanna makes hear it again and again. The tracks are I'M A SOLDIER and IT AIN'T MY FAULT. The song I'm a soldier definitely deserves at least 2.5 stars alone. IT AIN'T MY FAULT also deserve a lot just from the judgement of their flows. In conclusion, I still do not recemmond you to get this CD. Face the facts, Shocker is the worst rapper in the NL family. I would rather have Fiend, D.I.G. my Soldier Slim, Mystikal, and the Gambino Family."
3,I'M SHOCKED BY SILK!,"I EXPECTED THIS ALBUM TO BE A VE`RY SORRY CD, BUT IT'S ACTUAL GOOD. SILK DOES'NT RHYME DAT BAD, ""AIN'T MY FAULT"" IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND ""JUST BE STRAIGHT"" IS GOOD CUZ OF DA SAMPLED BEAT, BUT WHUT MAKES THIS ALBUM GOOD IS THE BEATS! MAN' I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST SAID DAT. BUT, SONGS LIKE THE SNOOZER, ""LET ME HIT IT"" HURTS THE ALBUM FRON BEING VERY GOOD. IF YOU LIKE NO LIMIT AND EVEN IF YA DON'T, LIKE ME, THIS IS WORTH IT."
3,it waz aiight,yo tha C.D waz aiight but i really aint all that hyped up bout it its just another NO-LIMIT C.D and they'll be more out it aint a NO LIMIT classic but tha C.D waz aiight I think if you really really really like NO LIMIT u should pick this one up
4,"Warm, engaging, and friendly","Each page shows a different member of Mog the cat's family, and what they like to do best. At the end, they all get together for Mog's birthday party (she's 3). Toddlers will enjoy identifying what each cat is doing, and other animals in some of the pictures, and you can have them count the candles on Mog's cake. The book is short enough not to tax toddler attention-spans, and engaging enough that even preschoolers will ask to read it again.Mog is a wonderful family pet, not anthropomorphized, but enjoyed for what she is and loved by her family."
4,Rating,The book is great and insightful. It teaches you how to intimately be in love withGod. Great book
5,My ten year old son couldn't put it down.,"This is best baseball facts book I have every read. Its fun and entertaining.My son, who is an avid baseball fan checked it out from the library and was rarely seen without it until he had read the entire book. He read it in the car, on the school bus, on the way to his little league games, before bed, after bed, and even during church services.He kept on telling me such amazing and fun facts about baseball that when he finished it I read it too"
5,Four pretty people - and Paris too!,"I saw this movie during its original theatrical release and never forgot its magic. Viewing it again nearly forty years later, the magic remained. A slight premise took on depth and meaning in the hands of these four actors. It could have become soap or melodrama - it stayed within its modest limits to let us enjoy the chemistry of these four fine players together. I cannot believe that Newman and Poitier never did anything else together - nor did Woodward and Poitier, nor Carroll and Newman. A sequel to this movie would have such great promise, depicting the lives of these characters (same players0 forty years later. But if not, we'll always have Paris - Blues, that is."
1,"Does not cover all year Civics, only 1996-1998","I just received this kit as the recommended by Amazon for a 1995 Honda Civic. The first thing I notice on the manual is the Civic application, years 1996-1998. Seems to fall just a big short of 1995, the last year of the model. I would have known this if there was a way to check the year and model vs. the kit; instead of a generic Honda 90-00' description."
1,wasn't right,The book inside the bag was correct.The parts inside the bag did not match the book.The book drawings would have worked.So I bought one off of Ebay and it was correct.
3,Metra dash kit,It looks nice and looks like it fits but the bottom 2 clips dont latch right on my 94 accord ex 4dr leather's trim as the trim has a bit of a taper to it. Still works ok and fairly secure but wish those 2 clips made the snap sound when installing...aw well
2,Not a Clean Fit for the 1998 CRV,"This is advertised for use with the 1998 Honda CR-V. There are several tabs used to lock the frame in the console. Some tabs need to be removed, based on the car model. Directions indicated that 2 tabs needed to be removed and 4 were to stay. All but 2 had to be cut out to fit properly. It leaves the stereo vulnerable to theft. Other modifications were required to secure the stereo. Other than that, the directions for removing the old stereo and disassembling the car's console are outstanding."
5,Jet clamps are good,"I purchased two of the 40"" clamps just to compare to Bessey. I have about 20 Bessey clamps & felt they were the best on the market. However, the Jet clamps are better - Bessey is going to lose my business. The jaw faces are longer and wider. The handle is bigger and easier to grip and the release lever works great. I plan to buy more."
2,They work but that's about all,"Bad sound. A waste of money. I wanted to use them for hearing Sype, and everybody's words are muddled."
2,"Awesome sound!--for the 1910s, that is...","For speakers this inexpensive, it's hard to quibble about sound, yet something's wrong when even low expectations aren't met, especially given the many positive reviews here.If you lived in 1910, these would be the world's best-sounding speakers. It doesn't take a genius to see the problem with that statement. No bass, too much midrange, not enough treble, distortion-prone at even reasonable sound levels, ""plastic"" sounding, and with virtually no controls to alter anything save for the volume, these Creative Labs speakers generate as much excitement as kissing your sister. So rather than go cheap, pay a Hamilton or two more and step into something that won't bring you down every time you turn them on."
4,A pleasant overview of Rex cats,"A pleasant book that is well written with many wonderful photos. However, I got the impression reading it that Helgren was only personally familiar with the Cornish Rex and researched all the others. I found some factual errors and editing mistakes that were distracting to me. Still, a nice overview of all the Rex cats. I highly recommend ""The Guide to Owning a Cornish Rex Cat"" by Greta Huls for those wanting more detailed information about that breed."
4,Django the Trailblazer,"I absolutely love the music, but the recording does not have the greatest sound quality. Django Reinhardt was a true jazz pioneer. He was one of the originators of Gypsy Jazz Guitar. Do yourself a huge favor and give him a listen.Try this:The Best of Django Reinhardt. He was eccentric, unpredictable, drove some of his fellow musicians crazy by showing up late(or not at all) for gigs, but he was undeniably a genius."
2,"worked well for 6 months may be, then downhill",Not worth it. I think the issue is with the lenovo parts they are substandard there is nothing you can do to better it.
5,Great priceing,It was by far the best price I found anywhere and it is an actual Lenovo battery not a knockoff. I purchased 2 batteries for less than the price of 1 and I could not be more pleased.
3,Helps keep me fit,"This product supplies what is needed to keep me healthy, especially I since I don't always eat a well balance meal."
1,beyond vile,"my first EVER one star review.this stuff is so far beyond vile I could not recommend it to anyone with functional taste buds. I've eaten dog, live crustaceans, insects and STILL cant find words to describe how bad this stuff is."
1,"2,3,4 AND DARE I SAY IT! 5 STARS FOR THIS???? THIS!!!!!!!","It is October and of course I'm going through myHORROR stage(Um! Clint,every month is your HORROR stage)I just happened to go by The Mutilator and saw all theseRAVE reviews??????????????????????????????????????????Um! Where do I start? First I did see this a long timeago and I admit is it really fair to do a review fromwhen I was a teen. Well I debated but finally said YES!For someone has to tell the truth and this is CRAPULATOR!What I can remember is VERY bad acting,and I mean theworst acting of BAD acting! A teen gets it with a chainsawand screams like he's saying hello to a friend. The decapatationof the cop looked like a stuff-dummy! If you like SLASHERHORROR than buy The BURNING-MADMAN-PROWLER and of course Fridaythe 13th. But this! I rather see FREE WILLY 4:WATCH ME DIVE!THE MUTILATOR...MORE LIKE SEE YA LATER! Oh! one more thingthe vhs box does say a cool thing...BY AXE,BY BLADE,BY SAWBYE BYE!YEAH! BYE BYE ALRIGHT!"
4,A good review of relationship building techniques,"Are you trying to find ways of building or extending your network? Are you interested in learning some techniques to improve your business relationships? Jerry Acuff gives the tool kit that you can carry with you.This book talks about the different types of relationship levels that you can have with others (""The Relationship Pyramid""). This book highlights a number of techniques that includes questioning, caring, connecting, and setting up goals. The book not only helps you to develop relationships but also to maintain them.If you have already read a few books about developing relationships or networking, this book will just be a review of the techniques that you previously learned in the other books.The book gives a lot of real life situations & examples that makes it an interesting read."
5,CHUNKY RIFFS,"I purchased this CD years ago for a few bucks just on a whim and I was blown away. The track Two Bullets And A Gun is the kind of rock I like but hear very little of these days. A nice fat, funky mid-tempo guitar riff that screams. Stevie is a master at that stuff. If you look at his resume you'd see he's been around and played with some big names but I never hear anyone mention his name when guitarists are discussed. The guy writes some great tunes and I love his funk rock chops. I definitely recommend this CD to those that enjoy solid funk rock with attitude.www.electriceyes.us"
2,Wireless does not work well.,"I got this at a great price several months ago, and have been using it as a wired router, and was not using the wireless portion at all. Recently my wife got a shiny new laptop, and I decided to set the wireless portion up. The unit worked well enough with encryption disabled, but using WPA caused the laptop to fail to get an IP address using the DHCP server about 90% of the time, and this was five feet from the router. I would constantly have to disconnect and reconnect several times before the wireless would work. The fact that it worked sometimes told me that the settings were correct. I dumped this unit and replaced it with a D-Link, and my wife can connect flawlessly every time. Save your time and money, and pass on this turkey. Because it works OK as a wired router, it gets two stars."
3,Easy to install. Cannot reboot remotely.,"Like a lot of other reviewers, product is easy to install and speed is fast.It's a charm, but only when you're not making config changes.My gripe to share is that I'm using it with a cable modem (Comcast) and LinkSys routers (this is my second LinkSys) need to reboot if i) I reboot the cable modem; or ii) I modify the IP settings of the router.I did NOT have to do this rebooting with my D-Link and Netgear routers.This rebooting itself is not such a big deal. However, the pain adds up because the LinkSys management utility (the one when I go to 192.168.1.1) doesn't let me reboot the router from the screen. That means I have to physically plug/unplug the unit each time I make configuration changes. This is inconvenient since I installed the router in another part of the house, while I work in another room. The management utilities from D-Link and NetGear allows me to reboot the router, even thru wireless.Thus the reason I don't give this 5 stars."
1,very low performance & waste of money,"I really didnt like this.bec if the security is on,it doesnt work.with out security also it does work sometimes.but not all the time.so fed up with this.no more time to return this.already spent enough time in returning this piece before.this is the secondone I got in exchange with this.no decided not to waste more time.I feel I have invested money on a unworthy thing"
2,Signal Issues,"I purchased this to replace an older ""B"" standard router and ended up returning it because the range wasn't very good. I had the router upstairs and was getting poor or no signal downstairs. I never had any signal problems with my old router. This product might be ok if you live in an apartment or one story house. It is compact and looks good."
3,just soso,"signal is not prominent, but if your room is not large, it is OK. not good for p2p sharing."
1,worst router i've owned,"yeah, it looks nice, but in my experience... it doesn't work the way it looks.after 1 week, the router stopped working. i had to reset it over, and 2 weeks later... it stopped working completely. i've tried resetting, but that doesn't really work. also a few of the settings aren't very convienent.overall, it's a pretty nice looking but bad functioning router."
4,Wireless Router,This is one of the best router out in the market.It light and very comapct that can be sitting in the corner of the desk or hang on the wall.
1,Linksys sucks!!,"I WOULD GIVE NEGATIVE STAR IF I COULD.This is the worst router I ever uesd. The first day I got it, it broke down. It stop working every few seconds! Yes, every few seconds. You even can not surf the internet, since it disconnected constantly. And when disconnecting, you even can not connect to the router.Nothing good except it is small ang ugly!TRUST ME! DO NOT BUY IT!AND I WILL NOT BUY ANY LINKSYS PRODUCT AGAIN.THEIR SERVICE SUCKS TOO."
5,Great Size/Price/Functionality!!!,"This is my actual first WiFi router, and I was waiting to get one because I wanted the best and smallest, without sacrificing features. Well this router has all that and more.Has 4 LAN wired ports, WiFi B/G capability, and lots of security features that make it the best choice in a very tiny box. The LAN cable I use takes more room in my backpack than this router. Has amazing WiFi coverage for a router without external antenna, and has also the option for a external antenna to make the coverage better.Couldn't be more happyo with it!"
2,"Better than others, but still a 1.0 product","This is my 4th wireless router, and I continue to be amazed that these products are not tested by the manufacturers. The connections appear to be OK after 1 day. I am VERY, VERY familiar with computers and networking so configuration is not an issue for me although these devices are very primitive. The main beef with this is that this is a 1.0 product (1st firmware release came with it). The 2nd firmware revision did not fix the problem with the static DHCP that I was having. Don't you think they would test this stuff first? If your needs are primitive and you don't know what you're doing, you may be tricked into think this sleek device is OK."
4,"Great function, but don't upgrade firmware","I just got this thing 3 days ago, but I tried to do a firmware upgrade and it crashed halfway through. Unfortunately, this is the only gateway in the WRT54 series that does not run on Linux based software, so once a the upgrade fails, the unit is toast. Whereas with the Linux-based units, there is a FTP program that can load a fresh version easily so long as you can ping the unit.I didn't get a chance to test out the range and quality of the wireless, but if you find the unit isn't up to par once you get it, there is an antenna port that flips out and lets you boost your signal.I would recommend this unit because it's a piece of cake to setup, very inexpensive, and has great future-proof security (i.e. NAT+SPI firwall and multiple versions of WPA2 wireless security). Just don't try to do anything fancy, the original firmware does its job just fine."
4,"WORKS GREAT, SUPPORT FOR OSX OK!","Great product. Compact, sleek and sexy looking. The installation took very little time and setting up security took even less. When I tried to get support for Mac OSX, they kept saying it was LIMITED. Eventually we figured it out. Works great ever since!!!!"
2,No point buying this router for its wireless capability,"Its a great router and it looks nice, but that's about where it ends for me. I liked the small footprint this router made and I thought it was time to upgrade from my siemens 802.11b router.Big mistake. The range of this router is so poor that you will need to buy an antenna to even make it to the other other side of a 2 bedroom apartment. Why this didn't come with an antenna to begin with is beyond me.Stick with a router that comes with 2 antennas. This one was a waste of money."
1,AVOID,"This router is a piece of garbage. The wireless range seems good but for some reason its very slooooooooooooow. But what's far worse is the buggy firmware. Certain features - like static IP and port forwarding - don't work at all, and the firmware doesn't always like to save your changes when you make them.Linksys's much-touted 24/7 tech support is staffed by idiots.Check out dslreports dot com for more information on this abysmal product before you buy."
1,Something is wrong with its wi-fi,For some reason sometimes this router gets into a loop when I try to connect my pocket PC. I have to unplug and plug the router again in order to fix the problem. I have had no similar problems with other wireless-G Broadband Routers.
2,Connection Stinks,"First of all, let me say I'm not a ""techie"". I bought a new notebook computer because I needed the flexibility to use it around the house, so I wanted to utilize the wireless capability my new computer had.I received my new router and set it up according to the directions. It wasn't working, so I contacted their customer service department. After different 3 calls, I finally got my router to work.When I would use my computer, the connection was always very weak. You are supposed to be able to use it up to like 150 feet- I couldn't get mine to work correctly across my 13x16 living room. After dealing with this for about a month, I decided to return my router.My experience was obviously negative. Perhaps yours will be better, but my overall recommendation is to not purchase this model. Linksys has a regular Wireless-G router, and that may be better."
5,Deeply moving...,"I have seen a number of Truffaut movies over the years and had always meant to take this one in. I was aware of the Antoine Doinel series and had seen ""Stolen Kisses."" That film was much lighter fare, however, and I was not at all prepared for the emotional impact that this earlier film would have.Childhood is often romanticized in the cinema. Every once in a while you see a film that reminds you of how powerless children are and how they struggle to comprehend their world. Truffaut succeeds in reminding us of that fact without ever becoming mawkish or maudlin in the process. ""400 Blows"" ranks with ""Forbidden Games"" and Truffaut's later ""The Wild Child"" in portraying the world of childhood in all its beauty, strangeness and terror."
3,how does criterion compare with fox-lorber?,"I give 'The 400 Blows' three stars because of the sheer brilliance of Truffaut.But the Criterion DVD issue is a worry, particularly in view of that company's usual high standards. The film's ratio seems placed somewhere between letterbox and anamorphic -- the image seems somehow distorted in either setting -- and the crisp black-and-white of the original cinema version has been replaced by a dull grey tone throughout.How does the Fox-Lorber DVD version compare? It would be good to know if Fox-Lorber has mastered the art of remastering!"
4,Sleek and Practical,"I ordered this from Amazon after checking it out in a store and on the Salamander website. Has great features - finally a system that lets you deal with all the cables for your media! Also, mesh doors look nice and keep the air flowing. BE PREPARED to assemble this baby, though. Luckily, I had a friend with patience who actually read the instructions!!"
2,mac maintaince,"Techtool pro 4 took 2 hours to load. Without asking it defraged my hard drive so it could be all in one block. After that I could not get my iMac Intel Core 2 Duo running OS 10.4.9 to start: ""Can't find start up file"". I tried all the suggestions from Dr. Mac including single user and the original OSX software, all to no avail. At the shop they ran DiskWarrior which found and replaced the start up file. $80 for TechTool and $45 for repair and I didn't even have a problem in the first place. After that TehcTool worked fine, but I was not impressed."
1,falsely advertised,"This product was advertised as being suitable for my computer. It was not and I had to return it at a substantial cost to me. The seller Book Resellers was not responsible for the false ad, but either Amazon or the manufacturer"
4,"Good Refresher, but a Little Light","I picked up this book as a supplement to my cache of teaching materials, hoping to find some great shortcuts I could give to the students. While this is labeled as a ""Quick Review,"" I expected there would be some depth in it -- that's where it falls just a little short.On the plus side, if you or a student you know needs a really fast reminder of certain principles and formula -- consider adding this to your library.Stuart Gustafson"
2,Too hard for young kids,"I bought this for my son when he was 3 or 4. He currently is turning 6 and we have gotten it out several times for him over the years. It is very hard for him to get the pieces into place, and hasn't provided much enjoyment for him. It was a disappointment."
3,Monkeys moving,We gave this to our grandson...parents had to help him put it together...too many pieces and he lost interest. Perhaps it should be for an older child but I don't see him playing with it often.
1,VERY Disappointed,"I expected from the ad copy that the monkeys would travel around this piece. They don't. Some of them are attached to gears that cause a particular monkey to rotate around one piece, but that's as far as the ""movin"" goes. Also, the gears don't mesh well and lock up repeatedly. And since all of the gears are connected, it's almost impossible to identify exactly where the problem(s) is/are. Plus, young children can neither build this on their own nor trouble-shoot if it develops problems. I feel scammed."
4,"A simple, fast moving, uncomplicated approach to a very interesting premise.","A simple, fast moving, uncomplicated approach to a very interesting premise. I really love this genre, but rarely enjoy the stories (However I've tried, I'm really not a fan of Harry Turtledove)."
3,The shot falls short,"Mr. Conroy's premise is excellent and unique among alternate histories, but falls short in character and plot development. He also needs a bit more work in doing battle descriptions. The worst however is the too neatly tied ending that reads like the author decided to pirate history for a conclusion instead of being unique. Reads a bit like the Siberian troops in World War II arriving to stop the ravening hordes of the germans. Finally, no sequel that carries the historical changes on to alternate conclusions. A relaxing bit of a read, but falls short of it's potential."
3,Readable but not much more,"One of the reviewers called this the best of the series. If so, it would be a waste of time to read the others. Another said that this was superior to Turtledove's alternate history, which is silly.The book starts slowly,but gets better. The ending is ludicrous. Characterization is second rate - the characters are wooden caricaturisation. The plot is improbable. The military descriptions are interesting, if inaccurate at times.It's OK; no more, no worse. A quick read. No humor, no thought. I can't wait for the comic book version."
1,Poor Quality,"I used this pitter for making a cherry pie, and it worked great! Then, the second time that I used it to pit an olive, the base fell off! This item is not worth purchasing!"
1,Definitely not for Olives!,"I bought this primarily as an olive stoner. It is possible that it might work on very small olives, but the big green Italian kind I buy in large tins are almost impossible to insert into the pitter in the first place, and then the plunger goes off center just enough to jam the stone. As an aside, the not so clever metal hinge stopper on the end which is supposed to keep the thing closed when not in use is badly cast and simply will not work. This is a piece of junk, even, I suspect, for cherries."
2,Hmm.,"Well, I love the music and beats. I hate the vocals. I guess what it comes down to is, ""Do you like uninspired run-of-the-mill male R&B; vocals?"" If so, this album is most definitely for you. For me, there are few things in the music world that annoy me more than average R&B; music and lyrics.Not saying that Telefon Tel Aviv aren't talented guys, just saying that this album is totally not for me."
5,Informative Account of the Basque in Idaho,"While most Americans have studied the immigration of Europeans to the United States, our knowledge of the Basque immigration is limited. The Bieters have written a well-researched and informative account of the Basque journey from Spain to the United States. The book, packed with personal anecdotes of Basque immigrants, belongs on the bookshelf of every American history enthusiast."
5,"Relax, just do it","I bought the vinyl version of this album almost twenty years ago. Frankie had come and left Hollywood by then. Through the years, I kept coming back to it. And it holds up very well, for '80's new wave. ""Maximum Joy"" echos earlier Frankie Goes to Hollywood fabulously. ""For Heaven's Sake"" is stellar."
4,Stamps = yes & no,"Tis is a great looking holder - but my guess is, it is NOT for self adheasive stamps , as I could not get the roll to fit inside the holder until almost half the roll was already used"
5,Best investment yet....,"I bought this video as a result of reading an article Karlyn wrote. I did not expect it to be much different than any other swim video, but boy was I wrong. This video showed so much detail and touches on just about every swim topic one could imagine. I recently started swimming and just joined the USMS. This video showed me some awesome techniques and was very tastefully done. I watch it at least once a week to stay on top of my game. This is by far the best Freestyle swim video I have ever layed eyes on."
3,Very Good Swimming video.,"This is a very good video. The most important subject for me is that it gives instruction of how to set the arms in order to achive the EVF position.I am looking for how to improve my time in the pool, so it helps me."
4,Love Gary,"If you like Gary Bartz, you'll like this record. He's in fine form as usual. Loose, swinging, blowing record. Nice tunes too."
3,Ultimates Captain A.,Well my and the kid read the ultimates book where this toy of Captain A comes from. We got it because it looked so cool. But it broke at the waist pretty fast and we had to glue him back. and then the nose paint chipped off. otherwise it is a fun toy.
3,Could've been a lot better.,"I think Toybiz dropped the ball on this figure. I respect the economics of re-using old sculpts to make new characters, but Iceman deserved better. It's just a really boring rendition of the character. The base is great, but the figure should've had more detail. At the very least some interchangeable arms with different ice weapons would have been nice. Of all the X-men characters to appear in Marvel Legends so far, this is definitely the worst figure from a quality sculpt standpoint."
1,Where is it?,"Tomorrow will be a week since I ordered it, and it was supposed to be in by 2 business days. What happened?"
1,Not Worth the Wait!!!!,This product is useless. It does not provide any support whatsoever and is not worth the amount of money spent to obtain it. Don't purchase!
5,I have never read a more sad book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So don't read this if you don't like to cry : p,"I was in fourth grade when I read this book but I would recommend this book to anybody who can handle a pretty mature book.But a more accurate level I think would be from 10 if mature enough to 14 if they like books about any aged person because the girl is eleven ,I think .Mostly becuase the uncle of the girl is retarded and you need to understand that fact.I don't want to give away the ending but I can say it gets very sad at the end of this book. The way the author pulls you into the book is amazing along with the details! They get pretty much straight to the point but is still very descriptive somehow.I wouldn't judge the book by its size if you are afraid it's to long because once you get into the first page you're hooked, trapped in mischievious Ann's book ,and won't be able to pry the book out of your hands until you're done reading the whole book!"
3,My Personal Review,"The plot of the book ""A Corner Of The Universe"" is about a 12- year old girl named Hattie Owen, meeting her uncle, Adam who is mentally disabled for the first time. Her family and her learn how to cooperate and deal with his mood swings, actions, and way of life. After lots of troubling events, such as listening to someone call him a freak and sitting next to him during a panic attack on a ferris wheel, Hattie really grasps her uncle Adams way of thought and life. The setting of this book is a small town. The conflict of this story is the relationship between a 12 year old girl named Hattie Owens and her mentally challenged uncle. Complications and frustrations overwhelm Hattie's family by learning to cope with the uncle. Though after ups and downs they learn the true understanding of others and to never judge a person without getting to understand them first."
1,Looks fun in the package,"My son got really excited about these Spinners when he got them for his 12th birthday. Unfortunately we found that, even though they include some pieces to build up the bike axle, both bikes in the garage had axles that were ""between sizes"". Quite disappointing for my 8 and 12 yr. old boys.I sent e-mail to the support site but have not received a recommendation as to how to make them fit a hard-to-fit axle."
5,Original Wailers,Simply my favorite sounds of all time. I was a regular at all the teen dances in the Pacific Northwest and the Wailers were the best and always sold out. When you walked down Greek Row at the UW the original Wailers album was always blaring out the windows of the fraternity houses.
5,What should have been...,"Finally, thanks to the endless effort by Richard Hatem, David Greenwalt, Shout! Factory, and so many passionate fans, we now have all 13 filmed episodes of Miracles on DVD! I couldn't be more happier. It's unfortunate that ABC let this series go so early on. I can only imagine how great it would have been to see Paul, Alva and Evie in a second season. The show is dark, eerie and yet very bright and hopeful. It's this contrast between light and dark that makes the show so enjoyable to watch, not to mention the wonderful actors involved. Get your copy of the DVD today!!!"
5,Not your average tv show...,"I finally got done watching all of the episodes of Miracles. It only took me 2 days. This show is addictive! The plot was impressively addictive, always making me want to know more abou the Dark. The sidelines were intriguing as well, and enough to keep me guessing. It's sad that this show got taken off the air. It has thought provoking ideas, decently complex characters. I was introduced to the show right as it was going off the air. If it came back on, as some do, I'd be a weekly watcher, and I hate serial tv shows."
2,A book to get you started... advanced users look elsewhere,"I purchased this book while developing an intranet for my company. It does a fairly good job to get you started with Personalization and Membership (P&M), but after a while you'll realize that there's still a lot of information missing.For example, the book speaks nothing of applying filters with ASP or querying the DS using SQL commands or even any other objects other than the Membership.Userobjects. Many of which is vital in developing almost any website with P&M. There's a lot more that I'm just now learning about that I needed to know but this book never explains.The best way to learn? Until someone decides to write a comprehensive book on P&M, I will continue to use the web administration pages that came with Site Server (the ones that allow you to go through and administer the DS via. the web) as the examples and use this book only as a reference from time to time.Good luck!"
3,The Book of The Lion,"This book was about a young boy named Edmund. His master was a counterfiter and had to take his masters punishment. He then joined with a crusade to help his master. He then joined the crusade and fought King Richards and his army. Finally the crusaders beat King Richard and won the victory.They should of had a little more action in the authors story. The book I read was average. Also, it was still good to read because it was interting."
4,Good text book,"We use this text in my Levels of Conscienciousness class. Great illustrations, very detailed. It is a bit deep, so you must know some Psychology and have an interest and desire to stay on top of this subject."
3,We never used it,"My professor made us buy this book, and we never used it. The class was okay, and when I peered inside the book, it seemed like simple reading. So I'm not really sure."
5,Wonderful stain remover,These things are great! I carry one all the time and my friends often count on it!
5,Master piece,"Carved in Sand was their best album in the 90s but 2001 proved that they still do wonderful musicAura is released and great reviews where written in many key magazines but lets go back to carved in Sand which is a master piece and when you listen to it from the first time you can feel that this is what we call music ""sound of music"" wayne hussy knows very well how to write songs and the rest of the band knows very well how to use their tools.....so the mission is a combination of talents and their outcome is ""pure art""people should know the mission more and they should try to give them a chance specially radio stations and MTV!!!To tell you the truth i have never felt sorry for the mission but i have always felt sorry for the media and their taste"
3,Just My Luck,"Just My Luck may not be Lindsay Lohan's best film to date, but it was still really cute. I think teenage girls would like it more than adults or guys. If you want to see this film, I would recommend seeing it on DVD or if you just want a girls night out, then I'd recommend seeing it in the theater. I'd have to say that it was certainly better than Herbie: Fully Loaded, that was not a good movie. It looks like after this film she will be turning towards more mature roles in A Prairie Home Companion and Chapter 21. I can't wait to see the more ""mature"" side of Lohan."
3,Furry sacks for your feet,"These are very soft and comfy. They run large. I wear a 6-1/2 to 7 shoe, and the small/med Muk Luks are loose. The drawstring around the ankle keeps them from falling off. They are really like furry sacks for your feet. I would like them much better if they had vinyl soles instead of fabric, so I could wear them outside too. I've washed and dried mine several times and so far they've held up very well."
1,Not worth it.,Bought these before Christmas to wear in the car on our two day trip. They started falling apart the first day! Very unsatisfied with the item! Don't waste your money.
5,Heavenly,"These muk luks are the softest, warmest ~ without being overly hot at home footwear I have ever worn. Am going to buy more for myself and friends and family."
3,Shriekback for the masses,"Umm...yeah. This is pretty much an un-Shriekback like attempt to cash in on the success of ""Oil and Gold."" Some of the songs are blatent ripoffs of their own stuff, while some of the tracks (like the awful ""Big Fun"") just aren't good.There are a few good numbers, and if you love Shriekback it's worth getting, but if you're new to the band it may turn you off."
4,Cheaper than from Source,"This tower works well and already comes with lines hooked up. It is missing the beer washer, though, so you will have to get a beer washer (or use a hose washer, in an emergency)so the connection to the keg will not leak. It is a 2.5"" diameter tower. It also comes with a flange and bolts, instead of the twist connection provided with the Edgestar BR2000BL Kegerator fridge, so you have to drill some holes."
2,"Right Book, Wrong Reader!","I found Across Five Aprils informative, but boring.The plot was not strong and it did not hold my attention. I do not think that I would want to read it again, unless I had to. If I read it again, it would still make me sleepy"
1,so borring,the reason I read this book was for a school report and it was so borring I could't finish it.
2,A book for Civil War lovers but not kids.,It was a boring but informable book. Only someone that likes Civil War History could like it. I read it for school and it just about bored me to death. The slang talk and the writing was the worst. It made the book seem like it was writen by a five year old. it is not the best book for middle schoolers like me but maybe for an adult or someone that likes American History.
2,If /I/ didn't understand it....,"I very seldom rate books, not because they're not good or they are good, just because I read so many. But this one deserved something... what, I'm not sure.I live in the south, and I'm proud of it. I love the way we talk and think, and sound. However, Irene Hunt -- an author who usually I like -- really took the phonetic spelling TOO far. Even I had problems understanding it at times, and that's the way people around here talk!Aside from that, I did find the book dull, and hard to get into.In short, Hunt has written some very good books (The Lottery Rose was brilliant) but this isn't one of them."
4,A moving book about a boy's life during the Civil War.,This book was a great example of the life and times of a young boy named Jethro Creighton from southern Illinois. The book gives the reader a great description of the hard work and saddness that Jethro endured. After reading this book I highly recommend this for any history buff.
1,THE BEST PART WAS THE REVIEWS ABOUT OTHER BOOKS IN THE BACK.,"I HAD TO READ THIS FOR SCHOOL. THANK GOD I DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE A TEST,WOULD HAVE FAILED. I SPENT MOST OF MY READING TIME READING A SCARY REVIEW ABOUT A HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT. QUITE UNLUCKALLY I AS READING BY THE FIRE. I WAS QUITE TEMPTED. I WASNT TO YOUNG EATHER. IWAS 9,THE BOOK IS 8.7, MY LEVEL IS 12.9, I HAD TO PROP OPEN MY EYES!"
2,Not Good.,I read this book in 5th grade and thought it extremely boring. I recently re-read it in college and still think it is. There are many elements of family time and it does portray the way families were torn apart by choosing sides.
5,Wonderful 'Family Civil War' Story,"I thought this was an excellet book. I have only read it once but plan on buying it very soon. Across Five Aprils tells of how young Jethro Creighton and his family cope with the bad and good news duringthe Civil War. The Creightons live in southern Illinois, and their families views on 'rights' are different. GO READ THIS BOOK.......IT IS EXCELLENT......MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME!"
1,Across Five Aprils-not highly recommended,"Across Five Aprils is not the wonderful book people claim it is. The launguage is crude, hard to understand and makes a mockery of the North in the Civil War era. It follows Jethro, an unlikable farm boy and his primtive thoughts about the Civil war."
1,"Was this secretly a ""get to sleep"" medication?","I had to read this book for school. My favorite part was when I got to the end and the torture was over. I'm a HUGE reader and I absolutely love books, but I think this is the only story I can say that I didn't like it AT ALL.I did find one good thing about it. I'm a person who has problems falling asleep. I started reading the assigned chapter right before bed, and it was a very good sleep medication; it was that boring.It had no story line whatsoever besides a detailed account of Civil War battles (and letters home that had such bad grammar and spelling it was painful to read them). All the characters were flat and unrealistic. It was the worst book I ever had to read.Please don't waste your time on it."
2,This book is like a huge maze(very easy to get lost in),"This book is well written. It is about a young boy named Jethro who has to taken over his fathers farm at a very young age. All of his brothers are fighting in the civil war. He lives in a union state,but one of his brothers are fighting for the South, which causes some controversery. This book is very easy to get lost in, but it explains what a family had to go through during the civil war very well."
5,This should be the very next book you should read !,"An IT Pro life changer ! Short, intense, practical path to ITSM. Really a must have, specially for those asking themselve: ""but where/how the hell do I begin my ITIL journey/implementation ?"""
2,"way too thin, almost like eating paper","I just moved back to the USA from a country in Europe where you can actually get original French crepes, and was quite excited to find these ready-to-use crepes in my local grocery store. What a disappointment! Right off the bat, the first crepe was stuck to the plastic wrapping, so it came out of the package in shreds. The crepe is way too thin, almost to the point of being tasteless. Will not buy it again for sure."
3,For the lazy cook or chef,"These crepes are handy if you don't have the time, inclination or know how to make them yourself. They come in handy and the seller is dandy, but the crepes don't taste great or even that ""good."" Use in a pinch only!"
5,A Classic,"Being a professional astrologer, I rarely endorse a general 'sun sign' book on astrology, however Linda Goodman's book is, without a doubt, a classic of its kind. It certainly made an impression on me when I first read it and was one of the early reasons why I decided to make this area my life work. Read and enjoy!"
5,Linda Goodman's Sun Signs,I've had 4 copies of this book; loaned them out and they were never returned. I keep buying more because it is the best horoscope book on the market that comes close to describing individuals born under each sign. Whether you believe in this or not it rings true most of the time and is very entertaining.
5,Very informative (and fun),"This is a fun, informative guide to the signs you won't find elsewhere. Far from being the typical ""daily horoscope"", Linda Goodman details the various aspects of each sign(and the book is broken into sections which reflect this): general, man, woman, child, boss and employee. The personality traits of each sign are shown and tend to be quite accurate. Enjoyable reading and will help you to understand why you see things the way you do, as well as understanding other people in your life. I would highly recommend it!"
4,Someone Hacked This CD Listing!,"After buying the CD I asked Amazon to look into this listing because I thought the songs listed were fake. Turns out this is the Love Album first released in the UK. (Not the songs listed here) I suggest if you buy the US version you'll get three more previously unreleased songs by Miss Day.I asked Amazon to check this listing, they said , I could return the CD for a refund if I wanted to. I'm watching to see if they correct the ""hacked"" list of songs. (PS- I'm keeping the CD)"
5,Dancin' in the moonlight...,"Catching Thin Lizzy in a period of transition before one of the guitar chairs turned into a revolving cast of characters, ""Bad Reputation"" is also one of the band's best LPs. Guitarist Brian Robertson is largely absent, having sustained severe hand injuries during a bar brawl just prior to the start of the sessions. Scott Gorham plays virtually all the guitars here, as well as coauthoring several songs. The rhythm section of Phil Lynott and Brian Downey delivers the goods. Tony Visconti's prtoduction allows the songs to breathe."
3,Definitely not super,"This book follows the rise and fall of the 1985 Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears. Unfortunately, it falls way short of the same greatness that they achieved.While the book does a nice job of revealing some new stories (like the Jay Hilgenberg saga), it doesn't really uncover much of substance regarding the Bears. It does retell a lot of commonly known tales (Walter Payton's disappointment at not scoring in the Super Bowl) and adds a few tidbits to them.In the end though, this Bears team was fascinating. It was full of characters and stories from top to bottom. This book disappoints in not giving more meat to existing stories and not uncovering enough unknown stories."
1,absolute junk!,this is junk and nothing but a bunch of crack heads doing booty shakes. There is a guy in it claiming to get a lot and yet he has to pay a crack head to have sex with him in this flick. it is stupid and makes black kids from the hoods look like morons. BARELY ANY NUDITY
1,I am very disappointed,"I am shocked and appalled that Amazon would charge for this piece of garbage. If there were a way to get my money back, I would demand a refund. This is not a documentary as stated in the ""product review"" This is a poorly edited collection of low resolution video, probably stolen from youtube. The video is not 53 minutes long, but 38 minutes and 15 minutes of trailers and promos for other products from this person. It was beyond a waste of time. It literally hurt to have to pay for this. I agree with the above reviewer. Shame on Amazon."
4,A great mind,"Elmer Smith is a thoughtful, insightful columnist. ""Out of My Mind"" reflects his ability to peel back life's layers and find hidden gems of truth and meaning.Elmer has a deft hand, managing to critique politicians and leaders without sounding like a hard-boiled cynic. He exudes the warmth of an average joe without pandering. Elmer isn't stuck in the ivory tower, but is at home on the ground with the people. Fortunately for us, he is blessed with towering insights.Great job, Elmer."
2,A good oldie!!! Poor Quality!,"It is a great idea for these old movies to be made available by creating copies on demand. However, I must warn you the quality is bad, there are places where the DVD player hangs up (The DVD is new and the surface of the DVD is pristine), there are no special features and the price is too high for the poor quality of the picture. So if you want a historical albeit poor quality movie and you don't mind the high price go for it. If you are expecting a beautiful digitally restored movie forget it!I loved the old movie with Wallace Beery and Marie Dressler."
5,Extreme Enjoyable.,"A really enjoyable read from a brilliant author. A must for every one interested in the facts and history of the famous ""Mind Bender"". Very entertaining reading."
5,A must read!,"This book is a page turner with a lot of humorous and passionate love. Lincoln was a true friend and a man that alot of women's would love to have in there life.-Claudia Brown-Mosley, author of ONE TIME TOO MANY."
2,Disappointed......,I was disappointed in this book. I am a Byrd fan but the book did not flow well and the ending was not complete.
3,"Not Bad, But Not Their Best","I bought this CD when it originally came out in 1986, and was truly blown away by two tracks--the opener ""Black Light Trap"" and the third track ""Running On The Rocks."" The guitar work on both of those tracks continued the trend began on their previous album, ""Oil & Gold"" (which I would give 5 stars). However, this album overall is rather uneven, and almost attempts to find a new niche instead of expand upon one. One rather interesting side note--two background singers, Sarah and Wendy Partridge, share a last name with Andy Partridge, the lead singer for XTC and the former band for Shriekback singer/keyboard player Barry Andrews. Coincidence? I don't think so. To see what Andy Partridge REALLY thinks of Barry Andrews, watch the video for the song ""The Mayor Of Simpleton"" and watch for the scene that features ""Barry The Car."""
2,There is a Digitally Remastered Trilogy available!!!!,"This review is for the box set of dvd's, NOT the movies. I bought these for my boyfriend, a movie zealot. At first he was overjoyed, but then a fellow movie collector alerted him to the digitally remastered region zero trilogy available FOR THE SAME PRICE!. He said to look around the internet & you will find it easily from reputable dealers. His words, ""The video transfer on this edition is very poor, the subtitles are craptastic. Watchable, but just"".""As for the movies themselves, classic John Woo, outstanding action flicks!!! Hard boiled is my ultimate favorite, but it is closely followed by these two. (Never seen #3). So, while i do heartily recommend these movies, i do not recommend this particular transfer."""
1,what?,"Don't buy this. How did this ""product"" ever make it on Amazon? It's not even clear what is being sold here."
3,Great Tool that now disappoints me,"This apple slicer/corer is:1. Sturdy and sharp, so it cuts easy3. Cuts apples into 12 pieces seamlessly4. Washes easily5. Can be used for pears as wellI love it.February 10, 2012 UPDATE: I lowered my review to 3 stars because I definitely used this corer less than 30 times over the many years I've had it and the blades got very dull. I still like that it slices the apple into 12 pieces but it no longer goes through the apple like it use to. I would expect a dull blade if I had used it a lot (this is the one I keep at work) but I didn't--so this should have lasted longer."
3,"Helps make equally sized slices, but not so easy to use.","Let me make this clear. The premise of an apple corer/slicer is put the gadget over the apple, centered, and push down on the slicer, and behold, a cored and evenly-sliced apple. The bad thing about this slicer is the amount of push you have to put on the slicer to get it to go through the apple. I'm 265 pounds, and it wasn't as simple as it looks, or should have been. Once you get it started, then it's simple to complete the cut. It's the getting it started that's the not so easy part. I guess it needs to be sharper than it is."
2,Looks can be deceptive,"Looks nice, but it takes too much strength and effort to cut through the apple and then at the end of it all, it doesn't even cut the whole way through, so you have to manually pick them out. I'll go back to my knife, having returned it."
3,Doesn't slice all the way through,"This apple slicer/corer does a good job of getting through an apple, except for the last bit of skin at the bottom. I'm not sure why it is designed this way but you end up having to break off the individual apple pieces to separate from the skin at the bottom. I guess cutting on a towel might let you get all the way through but that's not ideal. Hence, 3 stars because I think people should be aware of this bothersome issue."
4,Uncertain to order,Could someone who has read this book please write a review and indicate whether or not the new edition uses all examples in Microsoft Access (as the old edition did) or not? Thanks.
4,Enlightening!,"I was very pleased with this documentary/DVD! It raised alot of good issues and concerns in the LGBT Christian community. Not only were the thoughts and sentiments expressed most everything that a gay Christian such as myself has asked or wondered about, it also came with instructional information and ways to incorporate it into a classroom/Sunday school setting, which is exacting what our church plans on doing.Where ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" touchs on theology and scriptural doctrine, ""Through My Eyes"" touches on the human aspect. Putting faces of good Christian teens & young adults, going past the debates and realizing their struggle with what people have been told by mass religion their whole life."
4,Refreshing variety !!,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Like a Bird"" and I couldn't get the song out of my head !! The thing I really like about the CD is the variety of styles it contains. Its truly a colorful, feminine, declaration of... 'This is me, trying to live my life !' Her lyrics vary from cut-&-dry to romanticly poetic, and her accompaniment is touched by every side of the spectrum.There's everything from classical string arrangements, to metallic guitar rifs, with turn-table scratching, bouncing techno synthesizer, and her cultural, acoustic guitar in- between. Her voice, though very nasal at times, is often balanced by her own lower, more soulful back-up. She often attaches a 40's jazz style vibrato to the notes she carries to smooth out her meowing. I think the CD is a delightful, tossed salad of sound, that will take you for a whirl."
3,Good but not a classic,"I will be honest, I was curious of Nelly because of a review in Entertainment Weekly. Now that I have heard Nelly Furtado sing I must say that the magazine gave her way too much credit. At times I felt like I was listening to Gwen Stefani of No Doubt who too has a somewhat annoying voice. Most of the songs on this album like ""...On The Radio(Remember the Days"" and ""Baby Girl"" I can get past the nail-on-chalkboard quality of Nelly's voice but on songs like ""Party"" and ""Well, Well"" I thought I would have to stuff kleenex in my ears. Amanda Ghost she is NOT! I wouldn't even put her on the same pedestal with Amanda Ghost."
5,Whoa Nelly!! you RoX!!,"This isnt your typical pop cd, she definetly knows how to make music!! her lyrics are unique and her music is speechless. With a mix of hip hop, pop, and who know what else, her voice just captures the moment. You cant just listen to Im like a bird and get a bit of what she is about, you have to listen to the whole CD!! You will love it! Just like i DID!!!"
3,"""I am so tired of mirrors, pour me a glass of your wine...""","Nelly Furtado's debut album, Whoa, Nelly! is just ok to me. Unfortantely, I only love four songs which are: Hey Man!, ...On the Radio (Remember the Days), I'm like a Bird, and Turn off the Light. The rest of the songs just didn't do anything for me. I would buy her second album instead, Folklore. That album is incredible, catchy, and brilliant. I heard she is releasing a new album in June, can't wait for that. I like her voice and her songwriting is pretty damn good but Whoa, Nelly! is just middle of the road to my ears."
2,Just Not Good,I think her voice is too nasal and it grates on my nerves after a short time of listening. I also don't like the beat box-sounding music in the background of most of these songs. They seem to also lack direction at times and fail to flow as a song should.
1,"Whoa, Nelly is RIGHT!","Somebody has to stop this girl from making one more bad video in her way out of style clothes and way out of quality music. Her voice has that jazz quality like someone who should be singing ""All That Jazz"" in some bad remake of Chicago. I found Furtado's voice so annoying that by the third track, I was already looking for my receipt to see if I could return this piece of utter trash. Every song gets progressively worse. Her best song ""I'm Like A Bird,"" made me wanna look for a BB Gun. I don't mean to say that it's BAD. It's incredible written, but her VOICE! The album's basic problem isn't the music, it's the singer. They shouldn't have wasted such good material on such no talent."
1,"Make the bad, bad song go away",I know Portishead. Portishead is one of my favorite bands. Thisembryonic nasally chippy is NO Portishead.
2,Don't listen to waht the industry is telling you.,"Another example of the mainstream music industry trying to force us to like something. No, just because something is on the radio does not mean you have to listen to it. Nelly Furtado is getting so much media push it's sickening. Manufactured pop stardom at its finest here. This is no different than N*Sync or the Backstreet Boys. It's just a different flavor. *yawn* Can we turn off the Macy Gray cloning machine befor it gets out of control? bzzzzzzzt... too late. one star for the production quality and one star for the album packaging. that's it."
2,Whoa Nelly!!! 3/10,"Well I feel there was too much hype surrounding Nelly Furtado when her album and single were blowing up. But believe me the hype is all not that good to my ears. Her first single I felt was okay and I got the cd because I figured I would give her a chance but I only came across two songs that I enjoyed "" ....On The Radio (Remember The Days) and the second single ""Turn Off The Light"". I think Nelly writing all the songs was pretty smart but the songs stink so she should've worked with a few known writers and producers. Hopefully on her next album Nelly works with better producers and gets others to write her lyrics, because it's obvious she can't write good music."
4,An unexpected talent!,"I'll give any music a chance so I listened to Nelly. I was blown away by the control and versatility of her voice as well as the fact that she has a voice that stands out. I have to admit that it took me a few listens but it grew on me. I don't think the music she chose does her justice. She really belongs singing jazz. Pop is not for everyone but it's a good place to start and get noticed. Nelly, your wise beyond your years! Now show it and sing what your voice was meant to sing!"
5,Whoa Nelly ROCKS,"Her cd is the tightest dancing music. I luv it ssoooooo much. Especially Baby Girl, Turn Off the Lights, Trynna Finda Way and I'm Like a Bird. It even comes with the words!!"
3,It's Interesting,"Well. I liked this CD overall, I really did. It's interesting. Not amazing, not wonderful, but interesting. I like her words, I like what she has to say, but it's not really something that sticks with me. I listened to it in pretty regular rotation on my CD player for the first month or so, then put it away and never got it back out. I liked it, but not enough to really recommend to anyone. If you like this style of music (and realize that her songs are not all ""I'm Like a Bird""), then you will enjoy this. If you're sort of on the fence about whether or not to purchase this album, don't. It's definitely catered to a very different taste."
3,OK,Entertaining -- but a little goes a long way. Plots tend to be the same and the special effects are pretty poor. Some sub-plots between characters -- but these move along at the speed of continental drift.
1,"Three strikes, you're OUT","Like the other two reviewers, this item failed the second night I used it. Sat down to lie down and the middle leg just folded to the ground. I am 320 lbs so should not have been pushing the 500 lbs claimed rating.Unfortunately having a very difficult time returning the item as well so that adds insult to injury.Just a note, even if the cot had lived up to its claimed load limit, it is really not very practical. It IS comfortable once you are lying down, but it is too tall. I am tall, six foot six, but sitting on this cot, my feet do not touch the ground so I can imagine shorter users would really have an issue."
5,DVD/CDR burner,Great product but even better was the software that came with it for burning CD's. I had a previous version of NERO but this purchase came with the latest which is very user friendly.
3,duped by a duplicate,"first let me say, if you're buying this cd to listen to some random blues, you will enjoy it. there are great blues artists on it. BUT...if you are a collecter of blues like myself, then you will be disapointed. here's why: i already have the same artists doing the same songs...but on a different cd and label. actually, it's the same company (rounder/easydisc) just being distributed under the bullseye label (also part of rounder). also, on the song discription/artist listed here, the artists and songs are listed incorrectly from the actual cd cover. some aren't even on the cd. anyway, if you are a serious blues collector, BE AWARE! jersey slim"
1,A waste of money,"I'm all for encouraging people to read, but there is nothing in this book, or any of the other books analyzing LOST for that matter, that you couldn't read for free in the numerous forums, wikis, & fansites that exist for this show. If you are reading this, you have an internet connection... so use it to access the vast amount of FREE information out there. Take the money you would have spent on this book and search Amazon for one of the numerous books/stories that have been referenced in LOST/ or inspired LOST: The Third Policeman, Occurance at Owl Bridge, The Wizard of Oz, Stephen King's Dark Tower Series or The Stand, Bad Twin, Watership Down, etc. Buy one of those books from Amazon; you can thank me later."
1,Do NOT buy Kindle version,"Kindle version review:All images are cut off and near-useless. Terrible - total ripoff for Kindle version. I would return the product if possible, since the Kindle version is not usable."
5,Heartfelt and really fun!,"Loved this CD! This is great having fun party music, but if you really listen to the lyrics, this is great social commentary and very poetic. This artist really has alot to say, but it also kept me on my feet, feeling like a teenager again!"
2,Elmo + balls does not = fun,"My son loves Elmo. My son loves balls. But he does not love this book. It's boring. Five two-page spreads (with one flap on each) attempt to recreate an edition of Elmo's World -- talking to Dorothy and a baby etc. -- but the result is kind of a mess. The text is supposed to be chatty but it is ill-suited to reading aloud. For example, one spread reads ""Let's ask the baby how to catch a ball. Thank you, Baby! Watch Elmo catch a ball. Like this! Gotcha! Can you catch a ball?"" The cardboard on the flaps is flimsy and easily bent out of shape.This is not an evil book, but it was disappointing and I don't think we'll get any more of this series."
3,Durability is a problem,"My toddler daughter has loved other books more intensely than this one so I was surprised when this one started coming apart in a few days.First the flaps all ripped off. Then the cardboard pages came loose from the binding. I tried salvaging the pages for her to use to make stacks or just to gather up and put into drawers, etc. since she likes Elmo. Then the paper started peeling away from the cardboard. By that point, it was just garbage.I've had similar problems with the construction of other Sesame Street board books, especially very small ones (usually seasonal, like Halloween books). I've never had a Sesame Street board book last more than a couple of months. None of my daughter's other board books have fallen apart like these so I know it's not her treatment.The content is fun and the photos are a nice change from pen-and-ink illustrations but what good is a book that practically disintegrates in a month or two?"
1,"Very disappointing, no cure,","I know very well what inflammation is and how it adversely affects one's life. I've suffered with idiopathic inflammation for almost two years now. I've been tested for every disease, rheumatoid arthiritis, Lyme, erlichiosis, etc. The doctors cannot find the cause. I'm on Zyrtec 365 days a year to eliminate allergies. But even this does not lessen my joint inflammation at the young age of 43, thin, active and non-smoking.I anxiously purchased this book to see what potential cures the author had to offer sufferers. None. Don't smoke, don't overeat, eliminition diets, exercise... all the usual stuff found in every health pamphlet. Nothing new here at all. I learned nothing my doctors hadn't already told me or I'd read online. It's a well-written book on an important subject. It just doesn't have answers as the title implies."
2,Britpop at it's okayist,"Kula Shaker were never my favourite band, but I like a few numbers they did and purchased this CD. It's okay but the Kula lads aren't anywhere near The Stone Roses, which I suppose is a good thing.If you like the more commercial Britpop then you could do a lot worse than picking this up."
5,This man with the sultry voice - where are you???,"I have been playing the Irresistable cassette tape for months now after finding it amongst others while moving...I have virtually worn it out, so much so that I came on Amazon today to find it on cd...I ended up paying $23.00 for it, but it is well worth it... I love this man's voice..it is sultry, sexy and dynamic...Miles, if you read this ....why haven't you recorded more music like this?I bought the cassette when it was recorded in the early 90's...today, 2009 it still sounds Great.....Irresistable is a one-of-a-kind...it is beautiful!!!"
4,Bridge to Terabthia,"Katherine Paterson wrote a book called ""Bridge to Terabithia"".Jess Oliver Aarons is the main character he always wanted to be the fastest in the fifth grade .Then came a new girl from Arlington,Virginia who lives next to Jess her names is Leslie Burke.Then they become best friend and make a magical kingdom.This book is realist fiction.Then a hoorible tragity.The story thats place 1970 in a small town in Virgina."
5,Discovery of Bridge to Terabithia,"Bridge to Terabithia is an outstanding book!As a teen you will have such a blast reading it.Our 6th grade class at Princeton High School just finished reading it.We learned about our emotions and finding our voice.I would recommend this book to everyone.It has a very rich leason within it.Jess is a basic everyday kid with no friends.You are keep on the edge of your seat the whole time.You start to get an idea of what the ending is but wait don't make any final words!Teens can relate to this book very well.It has some of the same situations.So if your at home with nothing to do ask you parents to take you to the local libray to get Bridge to Terabithia by Katerine Paterson.Just so you know, her wording is very keen.You want be able to put the book down.I really hope you have got an insight on the book and want to read it.Just remember a book a day keeps the teacher away!"
3,sorta good,"The book was pretty good except for 1 part, MY FAVORITE CHARACTER DIED IN THE 11th CHAPTER. So, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who's favorite character is usually a girl."
1,Bridge to Depression,"Wow, usually i love realistic-fiction. But what happened here? A newberry award winner for this? It's about a boy whos family is disfunctional, poor, and he has no freinds. Sure this could be a good story. But the plot is that the boy overcomes his problems, then fails in the end. Maybe i missed something but i havent met someone who likes it. Desole, c'est tres barbat et c'est ZERO."
4,Bridge To Terabithia,"The book bridge to Terabithia by Kathrine Paterson the setting takes place in the 1970s in a small town next to Millsberg Virginia. Terabithiais a magical land were there imaginatins take over two people created terabithia Leslie Burk and Jess Aarons. With there frendship they create terabithia until one day a tragic acsedent to to Leslie only with the strengths Leslie has given Jess will he bere through her death.I realy liked this book, i liked the characters and every about it,This book has great deatal I recomend you to read this book it is a very good book thats why I give it a 4star."
3,Touching,"This is the story of two children who become great friends and end up playing in a world not like their own. A pretend world. A world better than our own. I read this book in 5th grade, two years ago, and would read it again and again."
3,Bridge to Tereabithia,"I would recommend this book to people who like a lot of imagination, mythical creature, and a problem for the king and queen of Terabithia. I really like this book for all of that. If you like all these things about this book I suggest you read this book."
3,Bridge to Terabethia,I would recommend this book to people who like imagination. It is a very good book to read. It has a lot of mythical creatures and also a lot of imagination. Also PROBLEMS ACCUR IN THIS BOOK FOR THE KING AND QUENN OF Terabethia. If you like all these thing i suggest you go read this book
2,Bland narration,"The book was interesting, but the narrator is monotone and really doesn't do the book justice. I would not recommend this product."
5,TERABITHIA IS A PLACE WE ALL NEED TO GO TO ESCAPE!!!,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME, AND READING IT OVER FOR MY COLLEGE CLASS WAS NO DIFFERENT I STILL CRIED, AND FELT LIKE I WAS LESLIE, A YOUNG TOM-BOY."
4,Paige's review of Bridges to Terabithia,"I thought it was a very heart warming tale of two friends. The plot was well developed. The description Katherine Paterson gave was amazing. I found the book rather dull in the beggining, but as I read on I found that the book, was superior to any other books I have read. The book was remarkable. The friendship between these two spirited young childeren is breath taking. Especially the end the book, had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I would get to a really good part and then the chapter would end. I just couldn't stop reading. The book was just AMAZING! Sincerly Paige McSanders"
3,bridge,My students chose this book to read. I had read it years ago. the book is somewhat outdated -specific references to past experiences-My students did not know what some of the items referred to.
5,Teacher in Tears,"While teaching classes today where my students were in the library working on computers, Bridge to Terabithia caught my eye. I'd seen snippets of the movie, but never the whole thing, so I picked it up thinking it would give me a little something to do between helping students. By the end of the day, I stayed an hour after school to finish the book and wound up in tears. I enjoy a good book like this and had heard what was going to happen before today, but none the less wound up wiping my cheeks repeatedly until the final page. It's a bit of a slow start, but not bad by any means. Five stars all the way."
3,What can I say?,"In the Bridge to Terabithia Jess is a 5th grade boy who loves to run. Jess spent a lot of his summer running so when the day that the 5th grade boys raced at school he would win and finally stand out. The day of the race was finally there some of the 5th grade boys got the starting line. All of a sudden Leslie the new girl, joined them in the race . The race started and all of them took off jess was in the lead but Leslie passed him, and ended up beating jess and the rest of the boys. This started a great friendship between Leslie and jess, which was full of excitement, sadness, and adventure."
3,The book was ok...not the best though,"I had to read this for school. It was touching at some points, but some of the chapters of the novel were all about money this money that, my sister are spoiled brats. I would recommend it to 5th graders...I read it in sixth."
4,"If you like adventure books, you have to read this book",I liked this book in many ways although I did not like it at parts. Some things that were done well in this book were the authors wordchoice. She uses words that are not every day words. Jess and Leslie have an incredible imagination. They create the magical world of Terabithia. Jesse is a very creative when it comes to drawing. He draws pictures of funny animals.Some of the things that I didn't like were Janice becoming friends with Leslie. Janice is such a bully to her why would you be her friend. The terrible tragety could have had a little bit more to it.I recomend this book to readers who like adventure. The story keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Characters have realistic traits and acts.
5,Kingdom of Terebithia,Katherine Patterson wrote a book called Bridge to Terebithia. This story is about a boy who has a family that doesn't care much about him. His name is Jesse Oliver Aarons. He also tries to all summer to become the fastest runner in 5th grade. Then this girl named Leslie Burke comes along. She makes a place called Terebithia with Jess. Then a horrible tragety happens. It changes Jess and his family forever.I really liked this book because of surprises happen all the time. I rate this book 5. I hope you enjoy this wonderful book.
4,Heartbreaking,"This book is a special treasure from my childhood. It's a true heartbreaker, but will leave your heart warm at the same time. Keep the tissues nearby, you'll need them!"
4,Bridge to Terabithia,"Bridge to Terabithia was an enchanting book. Jess is a hard core boy with a not so hard core dream. When he finds out that Leslie, the new girl who just moved into the next farmhouse, is different like him, he decides to try to become friends. They create a special place in the woods called Terabithia. They think of it as their place and nobody else can enter. The only way to get to Terabithia, though, is to swing across the creek on a rope swing. When something goes terribly wrong, Terabithia almost comes to an end. How these two unique children survive through difficulties in their lives will mesmerize the reader."
2,Bridge To Terabithia,"In this book, Bridge To Terabithia there was several things I liked about the book and a couple of things I didn't like about this book. I liked how the author Katherin Paterson, and how she used a wide range of good vocabulary. I also liked what Jess got Leslie for Christmas, it was cute and fluffy. Leslie when won the boys racing, all the boys thought she couldn' win because she was a girl. The last thing I liked was what they did to Janice, it was very funny.The thing that I didn't like the ending it was very surprizing."
5,Thank you K. Paterson,"I read this book years ago in grade school and it has haunted me ever since. The character portrayals, so rich and atypical, are solid reading for youngsters and adults alike. And the emotions in the story read as genuine, not trite or melodramatic as is the case with so much contemporary fiction, young adult on up. I recommend this book for children, parents and book fans in general."
4,Bridge to Terabithia outlines,"I think the book was good . It's just that sometimes the book was kind of boring.I think we should also read more books like this.It kind of shocked me when Leslie died.Although it's just a book.I like it when the books grab your attention.Although we didn't read this book for a long time I remembered it since the biggining.I didnt like that there was TOO MUCH , imagination.It was too childish sometimes , I think that's what made it kind of boring.I didnt like that they (Jess , Leslie) thught they were kings.Because theyre not! Anyway it was a good book i would recomend people to read it.Sincerely, Claudia"
4,Brought back my childhood,"When my sister and I were young, she used to read out loud to me while I washed the dishes. This is one of the books that I remember well--the two of us, laughing and crying together over the storyline. We admired Leslie and her passion for life and we mourned her death. Reading this book again (30 years later!) brought back, not only the story of Jess and Leslie, but part of the story of my sister, Sheila, and I. I love this book."
4,Bridge to terabithia,"This book was actually pretty interesting, but if you'relookingfor a quick book to read well you hit the jackpot. The book beginswith an ordinary farm boy practicing to be the fastest boy in thefifth grade(during summer). Leslie Burke moves into The Old Perkins place near Jess' house. Leslie ends up faster than Jess by beating him in a race. The two become friends and create their own magical Kingdom called Terabithia. There are many fun events Jess and leslie go through together. Yet, trajedy strikes all at the end of this fabulous story."
3,Not as good as the movie preview made it out to be.,"not nearly as good as it seemed. According to the movie preview, thought the book would be better."
2,From a 6th Graders point of view,"I think that this book was good, yet boring. I think that the author should've made it a little more interesting. We did liteature circles and my whole group rated this book a 2. I think the subject and idea (main idea) is a great idea. yet i also think it should be re written so more kids would like it. Otherwise it was o-k not the best."
4,Bridge to Terabithia,"The book Bridge toTerabithia,I would give it one thumbs up because it's a book of friendship,tragedy's aand how to get on with life.Terabithia is a magical kingdom that they rule.This book takes place in the '70's by Millsburg,Virginia.Two of the character 's are Jesse Aarons, and Leslie Burke."
3,Bridge to Terabithia,"The novels name is Bridge to Terabithia which I will be reviewing. Katherine Paterson is the auther of the book. Jesse Arons and Leslie Burke are th main characters of the book. A bad tragedy happens in this story that effects Jesse Arons. The setting is in a small town near Millsburg, Virginia. The time of this story in which it takes place is in the 1970s.I would give this story 3 stars."
5,A Terrific Terabithia Review,The book I read and am reviewing is Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson. The two main characters are Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke. I give this book five stars because it will hook you in the beginning and it won't let you go. This book stays real so there is no fantasy at all except when Jesse and Leslie create Terabithia with their imagination. I would recommend this book to everyone.Emerson N.J. fifth grade student
5,Such a heart touching story,"I read this book 15 years ago, and I still get teary-eyed when I think about it. This book ranks up with Where the Red Fern Grows. I can't wait until my children are old enough for me to be able to share this wonderful story with them,"
5,Bridge to Terabithia-You'll Need Tissues!,"Keep the tissues handy, you're going to need them. When Jess finally finds the best friend of his entire life, Leslie Burke, tragedy strikes. This emotional novel engulfs the reader and leaves the soul with a haunting feeling for months, if not, years to come. You will certainly treasure close friendships as never before."
5,beautiful story,"This story is sad,beautiful, and deeply moving. To me this is a wonderful story about how a 10 year old boy and girl from entirely different worlds fall into the deepest type of ""agape"" love, and how it permenantly alters him even after her tragic death. This book was so well written, and the characters so real that I am even investigating other Katherine Paterson books."
3,okay but sort of boring,"This book is about a boy and a girl who are friends. It's sort of boring, but then there's a tragedy. I would not recommend this book to young readers."
3,Good story but its missing some things.,"This is a very good book. With good characters. But there are some things missing(unanswered questions). For example what ever happened to Janice Avery, I mean she like disapeared after the incident in the bathroom. And Miss Edmunds. She diseapered after the trip to the Washington Smithsonian. And Mr. Aarons. Did he ever accept Jess's love for drawings? And don't get me started on Teribithia. To close this review, this book has an ending you will never forget."
4,Cheating makes me sick...But wonderful movie,I really liked this movie and for years couldn't remember what it was called. I made my husband watch it so he'd remember that cheating always hurts someone....or many someone's.
1,Ripoff,"OK. I know this is supposed to be low budget, but PLEASE! Maybe if I lived in New Hope, PA where this was filmed, I might have thought it interesting. Bad actors, complete ripoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers including pods and body doubles found in beds. The only thing missing was Leonard Nimoy doing the ""scream"" and pointing!"
2,Just Way Too Slow,"Plot is slow to develop, characters are lifeless, and after 20 excrutiating minutes, nothing has happened. Ambient sound effects drown out the dialogue, which is fuzzy, and the intent of the short, jerky scenes, which seem to want to indicate the leading character is having some identity crisis, is just in reality boring and depressing. I can't go on. There are better things to watch."
4,One of the best books- ever,"I love this book. It is not, however, your typical Steinbeck. It has a lot of layers, is easy to read, is simple, yet complex. A story of war, of men, of people, of will, of peace, and of conquer. I highly recommend this book. Having an original printing is a plus too, it adds character and depth to the reading experience. Be careful that you get one in decent condition though, the binding on mine was already starting to go. I guess that's what happens when books become 60+ years old though."
2,Heavy-handed propaganda,"WWII propaganda novella. Well-written, but the propaganda is ponderous. Worth a read as a period piece, but I can't really recommend it (though I love Steinbeck's work generally)."
4,The Moon might be Down but the book is still great,"When reading the book The Moon is Down by John Steinbeck I found that I enjoyed how Steinbeck would change scenes in the middle of the story. He explained his eharacters well, he made his characters come to life. His characters really shined when it came to dealing with the war and what was going on at that time in the small town that the book takes place, I would recommend this book to anyone, it is not hard reading, it just takes a little persistence in understanding the scene changes and the character devolpment."
4,"if you're learning to interpret ASL, get this book!","I've only made it through the first five chapters of this book for my class so far, but I'm learning a lot. The writing isn't as dense as some textbooks- definitely understandable and has lots of examples. So far I've learned how to write ASL gloss, some history of ASL, how English is used in the deaf community, about the formation of signs and different variations of ASL, and about how different types of sentences are formed. If you're working towards becoming an interpreter or if you're just learning ASL for some other reason, you should check out this book."
2,Not what I expected,"Well this cassette tape does have all the songs from the movie however, the songs are very short. The songs come directly from the movie. It is like they recorded the songs off the movie as the movie played. You hear the voices of the cast on this soundtrack...... I thought it would be more of a music soundtrack with full length songs and it definitely does not meet my expectations."
1,not too good,"This book is perfunctory and extremely shallow. Russell's reductive reading of the tradition shows little insight. However, it is amusing at times, hence the star."
5,A Classic,"Some readers of this book rightly complain that Russell has little or nothing to say about their favorite philosophers. I notice that Edmund Burke, the father of modern political conservatism, gets exactly one sentence. But, I think those who avoid reading this book are missing a rare treat: an interesting and informative history of a subject that many other authors have managed to make quite boring.NOTE: I bought a copy with the title ""The History of Western Philosophy"" on the cover. I wonder: why the definite article? The real title of the book is, of course, ""A History of Western Philosophy."""
1,Very Disappointing,"I spent a lot of time reviewing reflective tapes and thought this was the best one. On the contrary, this product was a complete waste of money. It has no reflective qualities at all. I applied several strips to my dog's collar and my sneakers in order to add an element of safety to our night time walks, but no such luck. I will not be ordering this tape again."
2,not easy to work with,no need to review--I would not buy again--no need to review--I would not buy again...I guess I will just repeat myself
2,POOR QUALITY,"This tape worked great for about a month, then it just started to peel off. In about 2 more weeks it just feel right off. This tape has tobe old or something. It's not worth penny!"
1,A Train Wreck Of Bad Information,Let me just say that I wish I had read the reviews at Amazon before purchasing this book. The two bad reviews are correct and barely scratch the surface. The reason my review is so low is that I don't think I have EVER encountered this many errors in this type of book before.
4,A decent release,"Not quite as memorable as some of the past albums but definetely worth a listen. Their sound continues to grow, I just feel some of the songs are not as structured as others. The instrumentals are excellent and the vocals are still up to par. Just wish there was a little more emotion."
2,The formula has been followed yet again,"Now, I have been through this 4 times in several different state of minds. Not one state of mind has concluded to liking it. This is as stale as month old bread.This actually sounds like a band was asked to write a caricature of a neo-prog rock CD. I keep buying each CD they release hoping it will all come together.Ingredients: Chunky rock-driven heavy riffs with the ""angelic choir"" keyboard on every song when the riffs kick in. A good singer in Rob that insists on over-singing with that Shakespearean theatric tone. This was like listening to mid-80's Sabbath or some other cheesy gothic rock band. I like Pendragon. I like IQ, Marillion and most of the bands that fit into this genre but this stuff is outrageously average. And I was trying to like it!!"
3,Was I anticipating too much?,"I must say that given the reviews, I was eagerly anticipating a great WWII enactment that would be along the lines of Band of Brothers, The Pacific and Saving Private Ryan. I watched the Blu ray DVD of this movie and as mentioned by other reviewers, the graphics are stunning. Perhaps what disappointed me most was that in comparison to the other films mentioned above, although I am not a detailed expert on exact events in WWII, this movie may not have depicted certain historical events correctly. For example, I believe the paratroopers landed in Normandy at night, whereas the movie depicts them landing in broad daylight during the final capture. Thus, what left me short of placing this movie in the highest category of those listed above was the almost unbelievable saga of super human survival although it is supposed to be based on a true story."
4,"I didn't like it, but maybe it's just me","This is a weird composition. I liked the philosophical libretto, but the music was either too slow (with endless recitatives) or too busy (with disharmonious mass scenes). I guess, I just don't understand modernity. Maybe this is a masterpiece, but I certainly don't see how."
3,Camera case,It's good stuff but it has not enough space to put some accesories and i think it should come with a belt
5,Buy this CD!,"Great new singer - powerful like Otis Redding. Hope she comes to blues festival in Notodden next year, and hope next record isn't too long a wait!"
5,Batman: A Death in the Family - A classic,"A very interesting, exciting story of the Dark Knight and his sidekick. Very well written, nicely drawn, and brutal. In this one the Boy Wonder, Robin faces Batman's darkest enemy, the Joker, and he might not be able to win against him. It's a true classic, I highly recommend to those who love Batman at his best."
5,Though All The World Betrays Thee,I found this book to be very enjoyable. What a rollercoaster of emotions this put me thru. It contained characters you could bond with and feel for. I found a few tears in my eyes for these immigrants and soldiers. Who would have guessed a historical war book could grab my attention and hold it. I learned about the immigrants and their trials and tribulations that they faced here in the U.S. and as soldiers of that time. This is definately a book for everyone to read.
4,excellent overview,"THis book is full of great information. Some reviewers seem to have been looking for specific info on specific models, and this won't get you there -- for that, it's best to look for a manual specific to your model, or join one of the many fine MBZ forums on the web (mercedesshop.com is just one) to search for the answer to your question.This book is an overview of most of the models MBZ has produced over several decades. You'll find lots of good info, some specific to your car, and much that will be applicable, if you've done your homework and know your car. This is NOT a repair manual, so don't buy it if that's what you need. But if you want to know how things were designed or what problems are unique to particular models and how to solve them, this is the book for you."
3,Okay collection of odds and ends...,"Lots of information here, especially for diesel owners, though nothing of any real value for a 560 SL guy. There doesn't seem to be any logic to the way this book was catalogued/organized."
4,Mercedes-Benz Technical Companion,"This manual has been very helpful for general task involved in maintaining and restoring my Mercedes. I own a 1987 300 SDL Turbo Diesel and this manual deals with certain common problems and solutions for my car needs. I do wish it was more targeted at the specific car I have, which is the only reason it gets four stars."
2,Basic information,"The information in this book is very basic, and it's conclusions can be found by using common sense for the most part. It is not a bad book though. I would recommend it for someone in high school or someone with little relationship experience. Reading this book at 24, I don't think it contained anything that I hadn't already figured out."
2,JamCam has Multimedia Card Problems,"I own a JamCam 3.0. It can write but not read all photos on a 32MB MultimediaCard -- it times out downloading and the camera shuts off after 100 photos. Also, it uses a proprietary format which is not compatible with USB card readers such as the MicrotechInt ZiO MMC USB card reader. Other than that, it is a good, rugged, cheap camera. Just don't buy a 32MB MMC card or ZiO reader to use with this camera."
5,Excellent first digital camera,"Just bought the Jam Cam 3. My son, age 8, on the first 3 days of use shot 64 pictures, with 15 of them flash, on one battery. I am inpressed with the quality of the pictures. Use the high resolution, (VGA), which allows you to store 8 pics before downloading. As other users noted, this is an entry camera, a great first pick for kids 6-12. We downloaded the pictures easily on the USB port (Windows ME.) The software includes Adobe Photo Deluxe Family Edition. My 8 year old caught on quickly to downloading, manipulating, and filing the photos."
3,Windows XP Driver Here,"I don't own a JamCam, but you can try here for the WinXP Driver. It appears this may work.http://www.noslogan.com/Various/KBGear.html"
3,Doesn't work with Win XP,"I got this camera originally for a WinMe system w/ UBS connection. When I upgraded to Win XP, nothing works, despite downloading and re-installing driver from JAMCAM website that are supposed to work with XP. I left a number of messages with the site (they are tough to contact). No responses. Customer support - zero stars.The camera worked fine on Win Me. Good price for what I got when it was working."
3,"Hello, reality check - this is a kids camera","If you've bought this camera for your 7 year old and had a ""bad tech time"" you've got reason to complain. If you bought this camera to document your once in a lifetime safari trip to Africa, well lets just say you should re-plant your decision tree."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought a Jam Cam last summer to introduce my daughter to photography. It was fine for the first five months (decent photos, easy to use) and then one day we changed the 9 volt battery and it just... stopped... working. A great disappointment. We live overseas so exchange is a real hassle. Now I am shopping for a better quality instrument."
3,WHAT do you EXPECT??,"I bought one of these when they first came out almost two years ago - bought it strictly for auction sale pics. I have dropped it several times, it still works. I added an extra 28 MB memory card, and it made a world of difference in the capacity, BUT it totally messed up the LCD screen - my USB connection is loose, so I have to jiggle it sometimes to get it to work - BUT!!! I have been less than nice to it, and it has been great to me for what I paid for it. Close ups are non exisitant (meaning don't even try) flash pictures are always washed out. I believe there is no longer a web site for the company - check that out too. You DO NOT need ANY extra software to download or alter the pics - Jam Cam includes that with the Cam. I WOULD recommend this (with a 28 MB memory card) for a younger person just learning photography, or someone like me that 2 years ago could not afford anything else!!!"
3,love the camera but help!,i was given this camera as a xmas present and love it.it is so easy to use and is great for the computer......i have one problem now......plse could someone tell me what is going wrong.when i am downloading my pictures onto the computing i keep getting the error code 5er.....the pictures will not download now...plse could somebody help i miss my camera!!!
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,"This camera is terrible. It produces terrible pictures and is a complete ...! I thought for a starter camera I would be at least able to make out some of the details or images, but this did not work at all! Save your money!"
4,Its So fun and easy!!!,"Ok.......I had heard rave reviews from Tech TV about this little bugger, and I decided, since 1)I am NOT really technically inclined....and 2) I wanted a digital camera.....I would give this baby a try. I got it out of the box...and was taking pictures immediatly!!! Now, I am a real digi begginner, so to me the pictures look great! Obviously to someone more experienced, I'm sure they would be looking for exceptional quality, but for [this] you can't beat this fun cam! I absolutly LOVE it! Even my 5 yr old can use it! It is a great little DigiCam for begginners, and young people, and I definatly recommend it. For the more seasoned Digital photographer....it is probably ""child's play"", but for us starting to learn, it is a great teaching tool!!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Bought this as a gift for a teenager. It seems to work, but has limited memory space (8 pictures) and a slow serial connection to download pictures (as opposed to faster USB). But what can you expect for the bargain basement price. Good introduction to digital photographer for younger folk."
4,JamCam - pretty fun,"For what it is, the JamCam is a nifty device, capable of both pixellated, bad photos and some nice clear images. I picked one up because I wanted to see if digital cameras were for me. I'll probably get something nicer in the future, but for now, this works for snapshots/e-mail purposes.Better quality can probably be gotten from it once one is used to it. I noticed that pictures with low light were the ones with the most odd artifacts. The quality of photos is slightly above the Color QuickCams used to be. Battery life seems good, interface is simple to learn and the accompanying software works pretty well. Definitely something to check out."
4,Better than I expected,"I bought this camera basically for taking snapshots that I could email to friends and incorporate into digital home movies edited on iMovie. I purchased a 32 MB MMC card and can shoot 130 pictures with it. I got the camera right before the Christmas holidays and probably shot 400-500 pictures in ten days. Of that number, about 25% were overexposed, too dark, blurred, or weirdly pixilated. The rest of the pictures came out suprisingly clear, and I ended up keeping about 100 really good snapshots (and didn't have to pay $$$ for film processing). For a toy camera marketed to email-savvy teens, I'm pretty impressed. The software package and USB connection couldn't be easier to use (except when you download 130 pictures onto your computer, it requires a huge amount of memory). I may upgrade to a more expensive digital camera someday, but for now I love my dopey little Jam Cam."
5,"Possibly better than ""Broken English""","I listened to this during an extended depressive period, and what a perfect soundtrack for lamenting loss and regret. She dedicated this to her lover who killed himself. This is a very emotional album, yet has moments of great beauty. I've read a dismissive review of her cover of Dylans' ""I'll Keep it With Mine""-- I don't know how someone could write off such a beautifully done cover. The arrangement and production are deep and resonant; really excellent sound.She can be a very, very uneven artist-- occaisionally beautiful and sometimes hackneyed or wobbly. (Both ""Rich Kid Blues"" and ""A Secret Life"" have amazing as well as cringe-inducing moments. She can really be all over the map vocally and lyrically)This is probably her most consistent piece of work, and she had a great crew to work with. They produced a timeless work. Brava!"
3,This book is awesome for children with problems,Who would ever know that 32 pages can change a child's attitude and self respect for themselves. Get this book for you young family members. It could change their life
3,They wont stop breaking,These strings definitely sound great but have the worst reliability of any string I have used. I used to use Alchemy strings and had one set on for 3 years without one break. With these I have had 2 strings break in the last 6 months. If you are going to buy these i would advise buying two sets.
2,"Fantastic Singer, Great Songs, Wrong Band","Joe Cocker was having a difficult time getting a record contract during the early 80's, and that may be the reason he was forced to use Chris Blackwell's studio musicians instead of his fantastic touring band at the time -- including the late great B.J. Wlson (of Procol Harum) on drums and incredible guitarist Cliff Goodwin. I've heard Live tapes of most of the songs on this album, and they put the recorded versions to shame. Ruby Lee, especially, boasts one of the greatest guitar solos (by Goodwin) that I've ever heard. The cold, mechanical sounding rhythm section and uninteresting instrumental work on this album are the reasons for the lack of excitement. I hope Joe Cocker will listen again to the Live versions of these songs, realize their great value, and have them released on CD someday. In the meantime, this wonderful band can only be heard on one CD -- ""Live in New York,"" thankfully available here at amazon.com."
2,Dissapointing Effort-Not Up To His Usual Standards. :=(,"Plodding, predictable and pedestrian. After recently reading the Fourth Estate and As The Crow Flies (both teriffic stories), this one didn't even seem to be written by the same author. Jeffrey is a great story teller but I have my own ""Eleventh Commandment""...Don't bother with this one!"
3,"CIA = Evil, Must stop the CIA, must stop...","If you like Rush Limbaugh, this isn't your book. Archer, a former member of Parliament, takes a skewed view of American politics and the evil that lurks within us. Notably, however, he did his homework in adding authentic details on late 1990's events within Washington DC. This book is often confusing. When somebody appears to die, be skeptical, they may come back more often than Shirley Maclain. Thank goodness this amusing fantasy is far from reality."
5,He spins a Great Yarn!,"I read on average 2-3 books a week, and in probably in 99% of all cases I can predict the outcome by the half-way mark. Not true of Mr Archer's stories! Truly these are page turners I bring everywhere with me until they are done.... albeit all too soon!"
3,A good book but not as I expected,"An exciting book, with a lot of action. Some parts not credible. Not as interesting as A matter of honour"
5,Predictable and too sappy,"As a great fan of Jeffrey Archer, I was very disappointed with this book. It was predictable and at times boring. Also, for a thriller, it was far too sappy. The last chapter was by far the worst ending that Mr. Archer has ever come out with. A shame really because I expected so much more from an author that has written short story collections with excellent endings (12 Red Herrings and A Twist in the Tale)."
1,Complete rubbish. Avoid.,"While reading this book I got the distinct impression I was reading a Tom Clancy, and a rather bad one at that. His characters are unbelievabe, the plot dreary, his style monotonous. Maybe I've read too many similar books but I found it totally predictable. The ending is just too convenient, and rather obvious at that. All in all, a rather dissappointing book, but JA must be given credit for straying from his tried and tested formula..."
4,"Good Read, but not Archer's best","After taking time to develop the plots in many of his books (Honor Among Thieves, As the Crow Flies, etc.) Archer writes this book as if he is coming up to a deadline and has to meet it. I enjoyed the book as it kept me turning the pages, but I felt that you could guess what was going to happen before it did, where in other books you were more often than not surprised at the next corner."
3,Readable - slightly disappointing,"While I was engrossed reading the book could not understand why JA permitted the head of the CIA become a Senator after the President got rid of her and allowher to go unpunished. Another thing I could not understand was how she was able to keep the President ""under her thumb with threats""The redeeming feature of the book was the surprise ending."
3,Enjoyable quick read --escapism--entertainment--,"Not as good as Kane and Abel but a good quick read,a day in fact. I felt the book was fairly well researched and comming from South Africa it was interesting to see was said with Mandala gone, Not a bad observation!!."
5,Archer's second best book,I don't like all of Jeffrey Archer's book but I really like this one. It is second only to Kane and Abel on his list. It is filled with heros villains and many plot twists. Trust noone and you just might survive.
4,"Good Book, great fun","This is a good book to read, the plot is ok, the thing that i dont like is that Jake Grafton in this book is almost like a superman, he can fly planes, well ok, but jumping with seals without like he was one for years is not very much real, and handle a squad of SU 27 Flankers with a single Su-25 frogfoot is almost impossible to happen .. i think this is the major faults in the book, the rest is ok .. one of the most improved chracters in this book is Jack Yocke, overall this book is very good to read and the history is well written"
5,amzing & excting! MUST SEE,"enter the jurney, you'll find your self, like the title says, in the #1 guide toSouthern Ca. See some of the best surfing the world. A movie for all surfers and surfing fans. guranteed for those who really like surfing !"
3,Disappointed: No Illustrations,"I realize that the kindle version must be smaller in memory, however, without the photos and illustrations, it is hard to make sense or use of the information. I appreciate the fact that it was free, but not a lot of use to me for my research."
3,Pretty Good But Missed Out A Bit,"When I Rented This Movie, I Had To Admit I Was Dying Of Excitment. The Book Was Very Good. But The Video Just Didn't Live Up To The Book. For Example: In The Book There Are 3 Kids. 2 Siblings (Brother & Sister) And The Brothers Friend. In The Movie,There Are Only The Two Siblings.And They Missed Out On The Doom Slide. And The Ending Was Completley Different. Much Worse Than The Book. All In All, a pretty good video, but totally different From The Book."
5,SCARY!!!!,"I bought this DVD for my niece who is a big R.L. Stein fan, both of the books as well as the old DVDs this was the last in her collection of the new ones. Needless to say she liked it a lot and was not disappointed."
3,It's ok,"The dvd is ok. The dvd offers an intro of the dancers and a short history of what the ballet is about. The stage is pretty cool and the dancers are great. They do every movements with pin point precision. However, the reason why I would rate it as ok is because I found the choreography somewhat crappy. I didn't like the way that the Giselle going mad sequence was changed. She doesn't commit suicide,she dies because of her heart!! Also, in the second act, when the willys kill the guy(I forget that character's name), it was changed pretty significantly. The guy doesn't die because the willys throw him off a cliff!! what's up with that.So overall, the dvd is ok. For the price, I would recommend to buy another version. The stage and the dancers' technique is great, but the choreography blows. I hope that you have found this review helpful."
4,Nice watch ugly band,"This is my second Swiss Army watch purchase. Arrived just as described, watch is very classy but the band is ugly. I swapped out the band for a more traditional dark brown band with white stitching. Looks great now and keeps good time. The watch is of average size but the dial is on the smaller side, so if you have vision problems this might not be for you."
1,Two scratch on the face case at 3 and 6 o`clock,"The watch arrived with two scratch on the case ( it was not casual ¡¡¡¡) ,and a very little hole in steel at 6 o'clock ,under the scratches. I can`t return the watch because it was send to Peru."
5,Grace Jones Is PURE ANIMAL!,"This cd is the epitome of all that was disco: animal lust and pulse pounding dance beats! Grace growls her way through ""La Vie En Rose"" like no other singer making it her own call of the wild. She belts out ""I Need A Man"" in a blatantly orgiastic frenzy. Hard to believe this music is over 20 years old! Boogie down disco lovers!"
5,This is a Treasure of a Book; Don't miss it!,"Good Grief! Heavens to Betsy! There are some errors of fact in this wonderful book, American Bloomsbury! This revelation is part of the new national game of ""Gotcha"" and not to be viewed with any real seriousness. The blame rests not with Cheever but with the fact checkers at her publishers, who were clearly out to lunch. I am currently reading American Bloomsbury, and finding it to be an utterly absorbing description of the lives, loves and strong beliefs of the Transcendentalists. Having read these authors from my childhood throughout my life, I have been enthralled by the author's relaxed depiction of their varying backgrounds; of the context in which they wrote their great works, and of the ways in which they interacted with and affected one-another. This is a treasure of a book; don't miss it."
1,Not a writer whose mind I enjoy,"At first I was impressed with Susan Cheever's apt writing, and excited at the prospect of reading about some of my favorite writers. But reading this book is a little like listening to a friend who enjoys malicious gossip -- embarassing, distasteful, and finally just boring. I get the feeling that some parts are whomped up; she's trying to raise questions that the facts don't justify raising. But mostly there's an edge of bitter glee here -- as if she's enjoying anything negative she can dig up. This isn't the kind of writer with whom I enjoy spending time."
2,An alternative,"As I read ""American Bloomsbury,"" I found I lost confidence in it. For those with an interest in the Concord of the period Ms. Cheever is discussing, ""Alcott in Her Own Time,"" edited by Daniel ShealyAlcott in Her Own Time: A Biographical Chronicle of Her Life, Drawn from Recollections, Interviews, and Memoirs by Family, Friends, and Associates (Writers in Their Own Time), might be a more useful choice. In addition to the many contemporary views of Louisa May and her family, there are vignettes of the Emersons, Thoreaus, and Hawthornes; reminisences of Julian Hawthorne and Edward Emerson are included. There is an excellent general introduction, as well as introductions to each of the individual pieces--all very informative."
1,Where was the editor?,"I cannot recall reading a more poorly written -- and edited -- book. With such tremendous potential in the subject matter and the obvious interest Cheever had in making the characters come (back) to life, it is a shame this book was published before it was really completed. Some fact checks (see other posts by people more knowledgeable than I) and significant rewriting may have made this book readable -- and even enjoyable."
4,Perfume Guide,"This is an excellent book that not only gives information about the perfume itself but also about the Designer/Company that produces it. It also gives recent info what happened to the Company/Designer, who maybe bought the label etc. It also lists other perfumes of that company/Designer although that could be a bit more extensive. What I like about the book is that the standart info about development of perfume/perfume bottles, manufacturing process etc. is relatively short because just about every book about perfume covers that. This book is more about recent information and new Perfumes and Designers without missing mentioning a lot of the older ones as well. It is excellent value for money."
1,Very Disappointed.,I have a pit bull mix and until her I did not know a lot about the breed. I have been reading everything I can and talking to other bully parents. I have bought several dummy books and always loved them until now. In the first chapter on page 11 of the book I was reading it actually tells you how to fight pit bulls. Yes it's only a small section but it is very descriptive. I am so upset and will never buy another dummy book. As a pit owner I want people to like my girl not worry about her attacking them because Pits are used to fight.Very upset in OK.
2,So So book,"I agree with Nunya Business. There are some interesting tidbits, but nothing in depth or particularly illuminating about pit bulls."
3,This is not a concert DVD,This DVD contains a weird silent movie and two songs(audio only):Solsbury HillTV killed the radio star.I was misled by the only other reviewer into believing this was a DVD of Erasure's concert. I'd like to know where he got that information from.
2,The worst of all of Crispin's books,"I think Edmund Crispin's books are among the most brilliantly funny mystery novels ever conceived -- he was one-of-a-kind and combined a truly polished and even impressive prose style with compelling wit and lively characterisations.That being said, this novel (published very late in his life) is not remotely in the same league as all his early work. He seems dissipated, strident and awkward. The story and plot make little sense, and the humor all seems forced, with none of the natural flow of subtlety that characterizes all of Crispin's earlier work.If you've never read an Edmund Crispin book before, for God's sake skip this one and read any of the rest of them. He was a master of humor and mystery-writing, but this book written in his waning years is no way to experience him at his peak. I'd avoid this one totally, to be honest."
5,Good ol' Impiricism,"It's amazing to me that this book is out of print while faddish new age types of books sell so well, and remain in print for decades. A slim yet coprehensive volume, this book is an excellent survey of what real scientific research has revealed about matters such as clarevoiance and precognition. An easy read that is refreshing because it lacks both the naysayer cynicism typical of the scientific communities general reguard for such things, and also the useless dogmatic baggage of the New Age Movement and similar groups. Rogo carefully explains the various aspects of expirements perfomed, and elucidates on the evidence and its implications with clinical and open minded frankness.Also included are methods that could be used to aid in personal exploration of psychic pheonomena"
3,"Fun shape, kind of flimsy","I have to admit that when I received this I was pretty put off by how cheap it looks. I opened the box and was surprised at how lightweight and flimsy it was. Yes I know that it is aluminum, but just be warned that it is pretty thin. Upon use, the pie came out very cute (fun shape) and the crust baked nicely. I really appreciated the lip around the top when making the edge of the crust. I just couldn't get over the fact that it almost seemed like a disposable pie pan. I haven't used it to make a cake as the product description suggests, but I'd imagine that it would turn out just fine. It would also make a fun gelatin mold."
3,A great story of growing up...,"I picked this book up on a whim at the library. I'm glad I did. It tells the story of the author's childhood growing up in Czechoslovakia. In a ten year span, we see all of her adventures being the child of dissents parents in a small town, as well as witness her heartbreaks. Woven into the story is plenty of Czech history and culture, which made the setting come that much more alive. The characters in the book were also conveyed wonderfully. Her family, neighbors, and classmates seemed to come alive. The only downside I found was a couple of times I felt a bit lost with the discussion of Czech politics, and sometimes the story moved quite slowly. However, I'm actually interested in reading more Czech authors now!"
1,So Boring : (,This DVD need to be pulled off the shelf and not sold at all it is out dated and the Documentary (China & the Forbidden City) is so all full. It was so boring it will make you thank you have ADD.CheersJames
1,Definitely Not Recommended,Don't buy this camera if you are running Windows XP. The driver updates from the Jam Cam website do not work and the company is no longer in business. Calls and emails to their tech support are not answered. My daughter got this camera for Christmas and we will definitely be returning it.
1,The WORST camera I have ever used!!!,"I got this camera for free with a Gateway PC package. I thought that it would be a good camera, boy was I wrong! I got rid of an Intel Deluxe PC Camera (Highly Recommended) and I have been regreting it ever since. I take alot of still indoor pictures for auction items and frequently have to take numerous pictures of the same item until it looks half way decent. I have to stick my finger half over the flash or else the pictures will come out solid white! No flash, too dark. Using the on screen picture adjustments is a joke!!! I will be unloading this to a sucker on an auction and I will buy the Intel again. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Don't buy.. company out of biz!!,"I purchased two of these beasts in August, primarily on price with the rebate. The company (KB Gear) is no longer in business (according to the folks who answer technical questions for KB Gear and their local BBB.Don't waste your money. It (the camera) does work well. I can't seem to find inexpensive MMC for the expansion slot, and I won't spend (money) for a 32M (for a camera who's manufacturer is out of biz)."
3,I was dubious but...,"I shopped around for ages looking for the cheapest digital camera I could find (I just wanted one to throw in the glove box or whatever in case I want to snap something). The JamCam 3.0 came up pretty good in most review I read, bad in others. The specs read pretty good from a technical perspective but like any camera it's hard to tell without actually using it. Anyway I settled on a JamCam and to cut a long story short, it's not bad. It's probably better than any other camera in the price range (not that there are many) but don't expect great quality - this camera is acceptible for quick snaps to send by email or to put on websites etc. If you buy it with high expectations you'll be disappointed, otherwise it's worth a go! Also you'll definately want to get a MMC to put in it - 8 pictures ain't much."
1,Toy digital camera,"A flimsy camera with very poor resolution. Photos break up at the slightest enlargement. I was promised a $... rebate, filed for it, once in May and once in November, and never received any response from the manufacturer. Save your money, avoid aggravation, don't buy this toy."
1,Buyers Beware!,"My daughters were each given a Jam Cam 2.0 last summer. We were unable to get either to operate despite all attempts by ourselves, very computer-savvy friends and calls to tech support. By the time we gave up it was too late for returns or exchanges. I wrote the company's corporate AND consumer relations offices to explain our predicament. It has now been months without so much as an acknowledgement of our letters. Given KB Gear's utter disregard and lack of meaningful support I feel compelled to discourage purchase any of their products!!!"
1,Poor product; rebate's even worse,"It's basically a webcam that can be carried around.I was conned into buying it because it was free after rebate.Now the camera is collecting dust, and still no rebate check in sight. Phone number on rebate form no longer works, and customers are referred to the manufacturer instead.I've filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission in regards to their rebate handling practices. Stay away from this joint!"
1,The price may be good but thats about it,"Ok this camera ate up 3 brand new batteries in 1 and 1/2 months! The flash doesn't work most of the time when you want it to and the pictures are REALLY bad quality.The only good thing is it has two ways of hooking it up to your computer,serial port or USB."
2,This camara stinks,"I think this camara stinks. Yes, it is cheap. That is all that can be said. It is a great camara if you don't actually want to recognize what you are taking a picture of."
3,Good starter camera,"Works fine for auction photos. Was looking for a cheap camera that would work for auction photos. This one is definitely acceptable for the purpose. Once you learn the techniques of working with available lighting and angles to reduce flash glare you end up with fast, easy pics to put up on your auctions without spending an arm and a leg to do so. I would suggest getting the extra memory card as soon as possible as at highest quality the onboard 2MB memory only holds 8 pics and at the lower quality it holds 28. I have only used the highest quality setting personally. Pictures are uploaded to your computer quickly and easily through the USB port but there is also a serial port cord included so you can use either. The software is really basic but sufficient for fast processing."
3,Purchased for a Gift,I bought this camera for my nephew's daughter - age 6. I think it will be just perfect for her. I had to try it out before shipping it on. I was pleased by how quickly the camera reset and I was able to take the next picture. With the flash on the pictures came out a little bright but not bad. It uses a 9 volt battery. The shutter works with a light touch. The pictures were clear - almost as good as my original Sony Macvica that I paid over $500 a few years ago. For the price it's a great starter digital camera. The software that came with it is decent and you can control the camera setting from the PC. Using the USB connection the pictures laoded very quickly.
3,The blue version's review may be helpful,"Use the search to check for the blue version of the JamCam - there is a link to drivers for XP and 2000 (and others) there.Quick summary: decent 1st camera, if you can stand 640x480. An MMC card is not needed but makes the camera much more useful. You can't use an MMC reader to read this card, only the camera. The flash is too powerful at close range.Stop by the blue version's reviews for lots more."
3,Great first digital camera,"I really like the Jam Cam I bought for a few different reasons. It's easy to use. Simply point and shoot. Secondly, it was affordable, a very good product to get your feet wet in digital. Thirdly, it's small enough to carry everywhere, so you can take quick snapshots you would otherwise miss with a more complicated camera.It's not perfect, by any means. With no viewfinder, you don't know what you photographed until you download the data into your computer. The addition of a memory card is almost a must, as the camera can only hold 8 shots without it. Lastly, there are no frame marks in the eyeport, so after a few tries, you have to adjust the camera angle to make sure you're not cutting people's heads off, or missing a third of a good shot.With a little practice and the addition of a memory card, it's a great little digital camera for the cost."

1,Very poor quality images,"I was prepared for a low-cost camera to give lower quality images than my old Fuji MX-700 but the quality of this camera was so bad that I took it back and bought a more expensive but decent quality camera.Anything dark on the JamCam's images seemed to turn into a grey hatched mush. The hatch also appeared, but to a lesser extent, over the highlights. I tried both 640x480 and 320x240 res. Neither was satisfactory. I can email a sample on request.The included Adobe software was also very limited. You can't even scale the picture to reduce a 640x480 to 320x240! What picture enhancement is available seems pointless given the source quality.Save your money and buy something better. (...)"
2,Vettriano Fan,"as much as i love Jacks art, this calender was not worth the money. First, it is set up with the days going Monday - Sunday, which is VERY confusing. Not easy to use. The pictures have a ""cheap"" quality to them and don't do the original art work Justis. I have owned other Jack calenders in the past that have been much nicer."
2,2012 Vettriano Wall Calendar,"I don't like the fact that the calendar is not laid out in the standard format-very confusing. It starts the week out with Monday, rather than Sunday. I hope they never do this again!"
3,"Nice pictures, but thats about it",I was looking for a guide to explain the best places to view the different rock formations. This book didn't meet my needs but has beautiful pictures.
5,A Treasure,"If you like Vince Guiraldi's Charlie Brown Christmas, you really need to hear the guy who started Christmas Cool. This CD can be played year 'round because every single note is perfect. The audio quality is also stellar. Put this on at a Christmas party and people will ask you what it is."
3,Mediocre,"I liked it but was disappointed with Wambaugh, I have read many of his books and this one was not up to his usual standard."
1,Wambaugh does it again.,"I like all of Wambaugh's books, but this one was really moving. It started out quite humorous but the ending was vey dramatic and moving. Like Fugitive Nights,Wambaugh's descriptions of the desert areas around Palm Springs conveys his love of nature and makes you want to visit. Even though I live in San Diego, I do not know and unfortunately have never met Wambaugh"
4,This is A really good CD!!,"I like this Cd a lot. The song I think is hot is ""when I look into your eyes"". I would give this CD a 4 out of 5. It has one old song. But the rest are new. They're thirteen tracks on this CD be sure to get it. It's hot."
1,Cheap construction for a not so cheap shoe,"I order two pairs of these for my boys, and within five minutes of my older son putting them on for the first time the plastic ""rivets"" holding the strap to the shoe broke. Shortly after that, a ""rivet"" on my other sons pair broke. Two new pairs of shoes both broken within ten minutes of them being worn tells me that this is more than just a manufacturing ""oops"". The rivets are a design flaw and whatever cost-savings they are to the company, they just paid for in customer loyalty. I will never buy crocs again!BTW, for those of you who have this problem, there is a fix... Go to the fabric store and buy some Blue Jeans Buttons to replace the plastic ""rivets"". They fit the openings pretty well, and they're metal, so they aren't going to break."
5,Awesome for little kids!,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter loves her Crocs! She wears them all the time, and even wants to wear them inside the house. They fit well, seem comfortable, provide sure footing and are washable for when she spills juice on them. Highly recommended for children."
5,Classic Croc - Great!,"Super cute. I almost feel that the classic crocs are the best of them. Just be sure to get the right size and know they run BIG. They are a summer staple. Easy to get on and off. Can get wet, super easy to clean and withstand a ton of abuse. I will be buying the next size up for next spring / summer."
4,Her favourites,Unfortunately my 3 year old is obsessed with wearing her crocs. As we come into a cold Tasmanian winter I have to negotiate every morning with her to wear her runners or boots. Must admit I love them as she can get them on and off so easily and they are comfortable for her slightly wide foot. Great price even with shipping to Australia. Probably wouldn't buy this colour again though as its not a particularly nice red.
3,wrong size,"Although this is listed as ""little kids"", the size listed is the adult men's size. I returned the product with no problems. The quality of the product was excellent."
2,Wrong Color,"I ordered blue croc, but I got chocolate color.My son was upset, since blue is his favorite color.I didn't want to take trouble returning it and exchanging it.But we were not happy about it."
4,Love them - Loose button,"Love this product! Confortable, waterproof and cute! The only negative is that the black button that hold the straps came off. Hope they have replacements!"
3,high price for what it is,"Don't get me wrong, my daughter really likes the Crocs, but they are not her favorite shoe. This is her third pair. But I believe that they cost too much for what they are."
2,NOT THE RIGHT SIZE INFORMATION,I BOUGHT THIS CROCS FOR MY 2 1/2 YEARS BOY AND I CHOOSE THE 4-5 M US TODDLER. WHEN I RECEIVED IT IT DIDN'T FIT HIM CAUSE IT IS TOO SMALL. THE SIZE CHART IS TOTALLY INCORRECT
2,Runs BIG!!,Well they are crocks. and the color is not what I expected. Burst is highlighter yellow! I was expecting more of a butter color judging by the photo. I read the sizing chart and ordered my toddler a size 8/9 his normal shoe size is a 7. Well he most likely will not be wearing these at all! By the time he fits in them it will be winter! Ugh so frustrating!! But the quality of the product is wonderful. Despite the color mix up i really wish his feet would fit into these!!
5,Solid Quality,I got a pair of these Crocks for my grandson and he loves them. They are made well and sized properly.We are all very happy with this purchase
2,Disappointed,"These are made in Mexico, and although it is 100 times better than having them made in China, they are defective. The cuts are not clean. They look like someone sliced them with a knife. I will keep them because it is a hassle to return them but being from CO and buying crocs since they invented them in Boulder....I am NOT happy with these."
5,Love them,"As soon as my darling grandson wears out his croc's, I purchase a new pair. The generic brands don't come close to the comfort or the style of the original croc's. I personally own 5 pair, some cayman, slides, and a pair of the shoes that kinda look like cayman and sneakers. We love our crocs."
3,Interesting and a quick read,I pretty much agree with the Kirkus review. It does provide an interesting view of how another culture sees things such as illness vs how we would see them.It is somewhat disappointing from a character and relationship development point of view.It does make one wish they could see Angelina!
3,PowerChair side bag...,"Excellent construction, good concept for holding items...Two Exceptions:1) Would prefer it had been at least 1"" wider.2) Would prefer it had been at least 2-3"" deeper."
4,Great player for the price,"This unit meets all my MP3 needs with only a minimum of problems. I wanted one so I could use it at work and in the car and for the most part it exceeded my expectations. Good quality sound and battery life. I have noticed a couple problems though.For some reason it can't seem to read one certain song I have in MP3 format, (of course it is one of my favorites.) It skips to the beat, though that is the only one I have found to date. The only major problem shows up when using the external power adapters. With the 12 volt adapter plugged in there is a high pitched whine even without the vehicle running and with either adapter the sound of the unit reading and indexing the disk is rather annoying. This doesn't happen on battery power so perhaps it is due to the power supply's output of 4.5VDC when the unit only requires 3VDC.Overall I would have given it a 5 if not for these problems."
1,Sk-ip...s-kip...ski-p,"This player skipped on every disc I tried to play; manufactured CD's, homemade CD-R's and MP3s burned to a CD. Every single disc skipped terribly. Very poor performance. I ended up returning it."
3,A good CD.,"I have started a Steve Roach collection and I must admit there are many other of his CD's I prefer over this one. That is not to say it is a bad CD, it just is not my favorite, but as a Steve Roach fan I felt it necessary to have."
1,Creepy and Boring at turns,"I am really glad that this is an anomaly, instead of the usual fare that we come to expect from JCVD. Some peeping Tom like behavior and a really uncomfortable scene in the river, plus a crappy ending. Then the rest was boring. I rented this, and will only be watching it once. I don't expect non-stop action, but this could have been better."
2,THIS IS KINDA DUMB,"A CONVICT [VAN DAMME] ON HIS WAY TO JAIL, ESCAPES WITH THE HELP OF HIS BEST FRIEND. SOON, HE MEETS A WOMAN [ROSANNA ARQUETTE] AND HE TRYS TO HELP SAVE HER LAND. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH EXCITEMENT AND IT SEEMS TO RUN OUT OF STEAM PRETTY EARLY. MOST OF THE ACTION IS BORING TO WATCH AND THE STORY IS WEAK. DIEHARD FANS OF VAN DAMME SHOULD LIKE THIS A LOT. OTHERS, BEWARE."
5,awesome,My husband and I was extremely satisfied with the remote that we purchased from amazon. The product was more impressive because we bought the large remote instead of the regular one.
2,"Good documentary, but...","This 1978 TV production gives an overview of the exhibition of treasures from the young pharao's tomb that was on a world tour at the time. The treasures are as impressive now as they were then. The picture quality, however, is no better than VHS. No attempt at restauration or enhancement seems to have been made. Even if your interest in King Tut is high you should think before buying."
3,How to make a good live Stooges CD.,"As the other reviews posted here advise: This CD is for dedicated Stooges fans. The audio quality is not what you would hope for. I have advice for those who want a live, contemporary, Stooges CD.1) Buy the ""Iggy and The Stooges Live in Detroit"" DVD from Amazon.2)Use your favorite DVD audio editing software or DVD audio ripping software to pull the audio tracks off of the DVD.3)Transfer the audio to a CD.4)Enjoy.Though Steve's sax is mixed a little hot for my taste, the audio is very, very good. Ron's guitar is right there, loud and proud the way it ought to be. The only downside is that there are a couple of songs on Telluric Chaos that are not on Live in Detroit. Believe me, it's worth the tradeoff.Not that Telluric Chaos isn't a good bootleg - it's better than average for a, well, a bootleg. Look at the back cover if you do buy it. The photo is reversed. Ron is not left handed. What's that tell you about the quality control of the producer?"
2,jury is out,"i have read a number of dylan books. i found this one the most difficult to get into and appreciate. i tried to read it a couple of times but gave up. it seemed too complex and high-falluten [?sp]. maybe it's me. anyway, for what it's worth i truly loved CHIMES OF FREEDOM, DYLAN AND PHILOSOPHY AND CHRONICLES 1. GOD BLESS."
1,godawful,"I'm amazed at all the mostly positive reviews! I have read the book and loved it, but this film makes no sense. Without Vonnegut's point of view there's no guiding force behind the zaniness, and it's hard to feel sorry for director Alan Rudolph because he changed the book around so much (in the book, Celia is already dead and Hoover is much more violent- less PC- at the end) I feel sorry for all the actors involved because they embarass themselves- the only bright spot is Mark Isham's moody, mind-massaging score."
3,For Kurt's fans only,"If you've read the book you'll probably enjoy this talented cast's interpretation of Kurt's characters. But there's a reason it took almost 30 years to come to the big screen, this was a written-novel for people to read - unlike so many bestsellers these days which are practically screenplays and you can easily predict the future film's cast after reading 20 pages. This reminded me of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - another unfilmable novel - if you've read the book you get the point but it's pretty tough going if you're not a Vonnegut fan."
2,Two Stars for Alex Cross,Our hero Alex Cross never ceases to fascinate but the plots are wearing thin in this James Patterson book. Once again we are treated to life in the Cross household including the wonderful Nana Mama and Cross's children but we don't honestly care all that much about the creepy serial killer. The lamest part of this book is about so-called vampires and their dialogue is so laughable that I was chuckling to myself as I was reading those sections. While I always look forward to a new Alex Cross book I'm wondering if J. Patterson looks forward to writing them!
3,Not the best from Patterson,The beginning of this book was boring. It was about vampire murders and did not have the intensity associated with James Patterson. The second part of the book was much better. Alex Cross finds out the identity of the mastermind which got the pages turning again.
1,TERRIBLE!,"I've only read a handfull of James Patterson's books and have to say that none of them strike me as ""can't put them"" down reads. This one takes the cake though!!! What a waste of time...."
4,A Good Read just not one of his best,"James Patterson once again controls us with the MASTERMIND, If you read Roses Are Red then you know all about the MASTERMIND. Violets are Blue introduces the readers to a crime commited by vampires, of course they call the infamous detective Alex Cross to solve this mystery. What really made Violets are Blue and okay read was that it was so predictable as soon. This was not a very good sequel as soon as you start to read the book you already know who the Mastermind is. Just because this is not one of his best does not mean I'm giving up on James Patterson he his a good storyteller. So I'm looking forward to his next book"
5,Violets are Blue,Great book. I highly recomend it if you love mystery and suspense. James Paterson has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat. Once you start reading you won't want to put it down.
3,"Pretty good, but not his best...","As usual, I tore through this one in three sittings over two days. I enjoyed the story lines but felt that they could have been developed to a greater degree. Maybe I felt that the book was too short. After waiting a year, I guess I wanted more. The one thing that always pops up to bug me is the constant name dropping, wondering what Pitt & Aniston look like in bed, or mentioning OJ right after a reference to Brentwood CA. Other than that I enjoyed it, but not as much as a few of his prior offerings..."
2,Violets that need watering!,"This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind. And, that also is a disappointment."
1,Disappointment,James Patterson has gotten lazy in his writing. Both Roses are Red and Violets are Blue were disappointments. This latest disappointment will ensure that Patterson does not get any more of my money.
4,Vampire cults and bizarre murders,"People are dying brutally and it appears that they are being ravaged by animals and covered with bites. Detective Alex Cross of KISS THE GIRLS fame is on the case again and things are just not adding up. He is being pulled into this twisted, murderous, rampage while receiving calls from the Mastermind who is stalking him, and undoubtedly wants him dead.Patterson leads the reader on a merry chase all over the country while uncovering murders that go back as far as 15 years. His spunky sidekick Jamilla, one of only two female detectives in her department helps him to mix and mingle with the Goth crowd suspected to be at the bottom of it all.The last part of the book is the culmination of the sadistic ""Mastermind"" and his plans, now set in motion for the destruction of Cross. It ties together characters and happenings from past books. I found this book predictable, no surprises here, but enjoyable none-the-less. I would give it 3.5 stars..."
1,a good argument for book burning,"This may be the first Patterson book I read, but it will certainly be the last. It was incredibly boring, no character development, no suspense, no believability. I am a long time mystery fan but I actually gave up half way through the book and just left it on the airplane seat when I got off. It certainly shakes my faith in the professional trade reviewers."
3,Cheerhoney45,"Alex Cross, a homicide detective, has to try to save the day again. This novel takes place in present time, and in many major cities. This good vs. evil theme makes you want to read nonstop. When the Mastermime continues his unusual killing pattern, Alex Cross is sent in to investigate. He has another problem along the way; ""blood-thirsty"" vampires that are killing people from left to right. My opinion is that this book is not as good as Roses Are Red, the previous book, but if you want a quick reading, this book is for you."
4,Violets Are Blue,"Probably one of the most ""gruesome"" of Patterson's books but still hard to put down. Can't wait to see what happens with Alex Cross next. I recommend all of Patterson's books in the Alex Cross series. They keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page."
5,James Patterson,"Big fan of James Patterson, easy reading, you don't get lost in too complex of a story line. Always surprised at the end. Wanting to read more."
2,No Vampires,"Vampires are not my cup to tea, however it didn't keep me from reading the book. There are horrible two murders in Washington. Their blood was drained. California has some similar murders. Fearless Alex must look into secret clubs and the like. If this is not enough Mastermind, a killer from the past is stalking Alex. What secret does he unfold? I would not read this one again. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
3,"OK, slight disappointment from Roses are Red","After reading Roses and Red, I did what I rarely do, preorder a hardbound fiction book. Violets are Blue, Patterson's latest, takes our beloved Alex Cross to investigate macabre killings on both sides of the country. The antagonist of the last novel, the Mastermind, takes a backseat in the first 2/3 of the book, other than intermittent cell phone rantings. When the eventual confrontation takes place, in some respects, it feels like an exhaustive afterthought. Minor SPOILER**: Eventually Alex Cross does figure out who the Mastermind is, however you wish he would have spent more time explaining to us how he finally figured it out."
2,A sad sequel,"Violets are Blue picks up where Roses are Red leaves off. And then it fades. This is the most disappointing book in the Alex Cross series. You know who the Mastermind is from the beginning. It's hard to beleive Alex Cross couldn't figure this out earlier!The ""vampire"" killers are incredibly unbelievable. Though this book is a sad sequel, it's a must for the Alex Cross fan. Hang in there Alex! Perhaps your next case will be more realistic!"
3,3.5 stars....Patterson not at his best!!,"Honestly, I felt that this book was rushed. All I wanted to know was Who, What, When, Where and Why the Mastermind is all about and his true agendas!! In Roses are Red, James Patterson told you who the Mastermind was at the end of the book even though he decieved you a couple of times during the read. I felt he didn't have enough material about the Mastermind, so he included a story of vampire killings, maybe trying to throw you off the Mastermind. In this book there were a little twist but not enough to make your jaw drop like in his previous books. If your a Patterson fan I would buy the book if not just read this at the library...it much cheaper!!"
2,Not up to usual standards,Disappointing read - felt that he took some story telling short cuts that cheated the reader somewhat. We expect better!
1,So...so.. awful..,"I don't usually bother to review books here but this book was so awful I felt compelled to take the time. I love mysteries, thrillers, suspense novels - whatever you'd like to call them. This book was none of those. A prior reviewer was correct - Patterson seemed to be making a word salad to fill up the pages. I was in my car this morning forcing myself to listen to the very end of this crap - mostly so I could honestly say I read the book - and heard the same SENTENCE repeated at least 3 times in one chapter. The end is particularly dreadful with endless repetition of Cross' worries, feelings, stupid random thoughts. Who will be killed next? He goes through his list ad nauseum several times. Total dreck."
3,Keep it real man...,ha...ok patterson has way to much talk of sex in his books...this book is alittle perverted...and i understand...psychopaths = perverts...but it just grosses you out to much at times. But you get the Mastermind ending.At first i wasnt going to read this one at all...but after Roses are Red...i had too...so if you dont want to listen about vampires...dont read roses are red. it SUCKS you in haha...sorry for the pun. Good book...but nothing special.
3,Classic Patterson--although a bit fomulaic...,"I enjoyed the book--great plot, good character development & he has an ingenius way of weaving together plots almost seamlessly. However his books seem to be getting too predictable--I knew the killer half way through the book. Now I'm very good at solving things like this but I thought it would be more along the lines of..you don't know who it was until the very last page. That's the kind of reading I enjoy & I felt this installment in the Alex Cross series lacked. I think maybe Patterson needs to take a new ""angle"" or ""direction"" with the Alex Cross series--they're getting a bit stale & he's so talented--it's a shame to waste that."
2,Disappointing.....,"Although I did enjoy this book more than 'Roses Are Red', I am diappointed in the path that Patterson's Alex Cross novels have taken. Each novel in the series since 'Cat and Mouse' has involved less police work and very little suspense. At several points in Violets are Blue, I found myself feeling as though I had read this all before - Cross asking himself questions about the killers, Cross yearning for his current partner, Cross yearning for his former partners from previous books, Cross feeling guilty for not being with his children, etc. Where is the suspense? The police work?? In Violets are Blue, Cross did nothing to catch the vampires or the Mastermind - the police find the vampires on a tip from a journalist, and Cross stumbles across the Mastermind after ""having a feeling"" - please. I hope Patterson has some better ideas for the next Cross novel."
4,A very good entry to the Alex Cross series,"As opposite to many viewers, I actually find this entry a very enjoyable one. As a veteran fan of Alex Cross, and after reading more than once for each entry in the whole series, I must say that Violets Are Blue are quite unique in several ways.First, the focus on vampire-like murders make me feel like reading a crossover with X-file/Buffy. Second, Cross and Jamila weres in many moments too close to Mastermind that you would really feel worry about them. Third, the ending is a real twist and it makes me unstoppable to turn the pages to know what will happen. Finally, this entry almost signify the end of Cross's life in Washington PD migrating to FBI.Another good thing about Cross series is that, once you are hooked to them, the characters (Nana, Sampson, Christine, Jamila, ...... are just so real that they all like part of your life)"
2,Just OK,I was looking for a book to really scare me. This one didn't. This is only the 2nd James Petterson book I have read and I can say both were kind of a dissapointment. I mean it was okay but it was not great. I am glad I just checked it out and did not buy it.
1,Sadistic garbage,What's with the trend for crime to occur in the most horrific ways possible? Here it's vampires. Add the poor writing and you're better off skipping this and reading anothr book.
4,Narrower than the men's version,"These are great slip-ons...almost as comfortable as Birkenstocks! However, beware the women's version if you have wider feet. They are quite a bit more narrow and snug fitting. Personally, I wish I had gotten mine in a boy's size 6 (I am a women's size 7) - I found them more comfortable!"
3,This sandall runs small,"This sandall runs small. Be sure to order a size larger than you normally wear. Also, I had a difficult time with Eastbay returning this item. I wanted to exchange it for another size and they didn't response. I had to email them to find out the status. They refunded me but only for the item. I ended up paying shipping twice on this item. I would have been okay with a different color in the size I needed, but they told me I would have to reorder again (ie... paying shipping for the third time)."
5,People Magazine was right. This is a great book.,"I loved this book. People magazine's editors should be commended for calling it like it is: a fun, slim well illustrated book. Enjoy!"
2,An insult to Jules Verne,"Very boring, set in the mid 1970s. Don't know how I managed to finish it.Hopefully this guy can write better."
5,is where the heart is!,If you enjoy the sound of the Simply Red you will like this CD. I like it and listen often to it often.
4,Totally Unexpected!,"With hits like ""Holding back the years"", ""Money too tight to mention"" and ""Stars"", Simply Red a.k.a. Mick Hucknall established a reputation as one of the best blue-eyed British pop/soul artists of the 80s and 90s. Yet, the band reached a musicall lull in the latter half of the 90s with forgettable albums like ""Love and the Russian Winter"". Considering their track record with the last few albums, it would be difficult to have any expectations from ""Home"". No one would have guessed that Simply Red was yet to unveil one of their finest albums ever and the best single of their career - ""Sunrise"". The other highlights of the album include ""You make me feel brand new"" (a cover of the Stylistics) and ""Something for you"". I hope Mick Hucknall is able to continue with his renewed musical streak for years to come.Songs for the casual listener: SunriseSongs for the Simply Red fan: Home, Something for you, It's you, You make me feel brand new and SUNRISE!!!!"
4,Great CD,"I have been listening to this cd for 1 week now and it is all thta. Couple remakes I am not found of. Tracks 3, 5, 7 are incredible."
4,Surprising integration,"I was driving somewhere when I heard ""Sunrise"". (If I am not listening to dance music, the smooth jazz station will be on in my car.) Then, this song came on and I could not believe that it was from Simply Red. I am not a huge fan of sampling but with this song, the integration of an old Hall and Oates tune had me hooked. There is something different about the lead singer's voice though. It varies from his sound in ""Holding Back the Years"". If anything, I wished that ""Sunrise"" was included in the greatest hits album."
1,Simply Horrid,The only good song on here is sunrise.. You make me feel brand new is the worst song I ever heard. I heard it on the DELIAH show for goodness sakes and it sounded a like a cat dying instead of the good voice of simply red. By Sunrise the single and escape this whole cd of SIMPLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Maybe its just me, but","I didn't even get past the diet. First, there are all the different ratios of proteins, carbos, and fat, depending on your type. Then there are different foods depending on your type. Then you can factor in blood type to make this even more complicated. If you are single this may be great, but I am cooking for a family and not everyone is the same. Way too complicated for me."
1,Worst Purchase Ever Made on Amazon,"This English Breakfast tea is terrible and to think that I bought 300 tea bags. It has no flavor even with major steeping time, it's simply dull! I have purchased Taylors of Harrogate English Breakfast tea in the past but this one is a dud. If you want a cup of bracing English Breakfast tea, this is not the product - from a 30 years tea drinker."
3,Doesn't taste the same as loose leaves,"We bought this thinking it would be a convenient replacement for the looseleave version of the same tea. But it just doesn't taste the same (for all 6 boxes of them). It tasted a little dusty, almost. We now switch back to the loose leaves (tin version) and use tea filter bag for convenience."
2,"Ok, but not good.","I am a fan of metal in general, and bought this album on the recomendation of a friend, and I have been dissapointed. The only thing keeping this album from being a failure is the cool riffs that are at the start of most songs. Sadly, after 30 seconds the songs are almost impossible to tell apart due to the fact the lyrics sound the same, and the rest of the song is very repetitve.If your a fan of the band I suggest you pick it up otherwise avoid it and wait for their next effort."
5,Good Thrid release,"I've had the honor of hearing some fine metal since the 2006 year rolled in. Nothing has even come close to touching dead to falls newest cd, ""the phoenix throne.""This bad boy is packed full of dark melodies, grueling thrash rhythms, and fine hardcore breakdowns..all topped with some of the best metal vocals to hit the stereo.I have enjoyed a good 9-10 listens of this album since I got it yesterday, and have yet to find a spot I don't like, let alone love. get it, love it, even marry it, because metal just doesn't get much better than this."
3,Disappointed,"I have to say that after listening to the cd copy of Fingers that I was let down with the digital copy. I guess that I am so used to the old vinyl that even my ear could hear the difference. The cd was without the ""whole picture"" type of sound and I actually thought the tempo was faster than the original. (It could be that my turntable is just slow) but the heart felt vibrations the original gives me just isnt there. I have heard of people saying that the cds just arent as good as the old vinyls and I never could tell the difference - until now. I think the cd is good for the listeners who are new to the music and I still enjoy it, but for now Im going to clean up my vinyl and make another copy onto cassette."
5,"Everything you ever wanted to know about a soldier's life in ""Nam","This is the best book by far. You get to ""meet"" these boys from the very beginning of their military life all the way through their hell in Vietnam. You can't help but get attached and you're cheering them on in the most horrible of circumstances. I watched the war on TV every night back then and didn't realize how much more brutal it really was. This book will open your eyes and give you a newfound respect for these teenagers caught up in one of America's worst & bloodiest wars. These are the heros that were never given a ""Welcome Home"". It's a must read...it will change your life."
4,wow,this book was in good condition and the printing was easy to read. I am shocked to see my honey reading.
2,A Tale of Two Cities,"I don't have much to say, so I will be brief. I as well would have thought Dickens a much better author than I found him to be, I was extremely disappointed. He describes so much in too great detail (this is mostly a ditto to the previous opinion that stated the same). yeah I guess thats it. Good job, Davis, ripping off Cliifnotes with 'your' tone synopsis."
2,Not a good book,"I am in the eighth grade, and just finished this book as part of my summer reading. On a reading comprehension test, my reading level was determined to be that of a high school graduate, so I thought I would have no problems with this book. However, I found that Dicken's style of writing was impossible to understand. I had to go back and read paragraphs two or three times before I finally understood their point. I asked myself many times: ""Is this book written in English??"". Maybe when I am older I will learn to appreciate this story, but right now I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Good, Gooder, Goodest","I read this book years ago and think of it as on one of the better stories of Charles Dickens. Especially now with the Bastille Day celebration just over (July 14) in France. When I talk books with other people I mention it as one of the better classics. It's sad, and funny too at times. This is the sort of book I want in a bound sewn together book instead of glued together. If you are in school and have to read a classic I say get this one. If you're sick of the junk that's out there, tired of your computer screen, tired of your endless choices on satellite tv, and want to sink into an oldie, get this one. Once you get into the lingo of the language you just zoom away. A little period music in the background couldn't hurt. ""Let Them Eat Cake"" was never more distinct although I don't recollect a direct quote from Marie on the matter."
4,Pointless descriptions until the ending,"When I was given this book to read by my grade eight teacher, I was excited at being given the chance to read a real ""classic."" However, I soon changed my mind when I got into the long decriptions just after the beginning of the book. I was optimistic in the first few chapters, hoping that a real plot would soon develop. I soon realized that there was no such hope. I have never heard about Dickens being paid per line, but that would certainly make sense. With the exception of Sydney Carton, the characters were flat and too good to be true, especially Lucie. The redeeming feature of this book was the ending, which, I admit, made me cry."
2,This is certainly not the best classic I've ever read !!!!!!,"I admit it ... Charles Dickens is a GREAT author it's just that ""A Tale of Two Cities"" is certainly not the best book in the world!I just really think that he really wasted his life writing this book!!!Of course we all have opinions & if someone rates this book a ""5 star"" book I would understand that because we're all entitled to what we have to say ... so don't get me wrong if you LOVE this book!!!I suggest ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth""!!!!"
2,Huh?,"I didn't know what I was getting into when my ninth grade Honors English teacher assigned ""A Tale of Two Cities"" to the class. The only part I understood in the whole book was the first twelve words. I learned more about it from class discussions than from actually reading the book (which half the time was spent falling asleep). Unless you like to be confused, I don't recommend reading this book."
3,Stop your knitting & read this book,"An essential for your classical literature library. Dickens' writing is precise, descriptive and resonant.Starting with arguably the most well known opening paragraph in literature, TOTC has some memorable characters: the Defarges, the Jacquerie, Lucie & her father, Darnay, etc. Dickens' style - formal and detailed - characterises the ""season of darkness"" and ""winter of despair"" during the French revolution.I found this more serious than Dickens' other works. Darker, and lacking the humour of the characters who struggle from the streets and orphanages to riches. This doesn't diminish the quality, but don't expect a cheerful, uplifting read."
3,"Fine for what it is, but I expected better","I find it strange that Dickens, a supremely great writer at the height of his powers, should approach a subject of such importance - the French Revolution - and yet have absolutely no insight to offer on it. All he makes out of it as a romantic melodrama. As a romantic melodrama, it, is, of course, very fine, but one does have a right to expect more."
5,Phenomenal book! Extraordinarily written... a must read!!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a while!!! Sure it seemed a little too tedious, and boring at some points (because some chapters were utterly useless-- or so I thought...) As one reviewer put it ""everything ties in together"", which is a very true fact; thus my reason for reiterating the point. I absolutely loved this book and hope everyone at least tries to take up the 'challenge' for reading this masterpiece. I assure you, when you finish reading it, you will be very proud of beginning it in the first place!! Oh, and one little suggestion: Make sure you have a dictionary around you somewhere (because you will need it with Dickens' superfluous use of archaic vocabulary)."
3,"a Mtv generation, but with a imagination of one without a tv","In my 10 years of being able to understand what the words i read in a book means, this book is not as great as some claim it to be. Dickens use of words to create scenery and moods, was well written. As in all books there comes a time when the story lags and becomes blant and ""boring"". in the first book he is introducing the character and the plot in which the story will follow. this part i found wonderfully detailed but hard to stay awake with. the second book is more interesting because now the story is moving along the plot line. now book three is where dickens tries to pull together some quick excitement and then finish off the book.This was the exciting part but it was quick and could easily be missed."
1,Oh my god!,this was the most boring book i ever read. till the fifth chapter it was still describing the scenery. It wasn't at all going to the action and even the action that happened was more boring than sitting in a room doing nothing for 50 years!!
2,tis book,"the actual service of either reading or listening to the book is totally awsome but, the book itself I did not care for .This service is put together so well I don't think ,that I will ever buy another paperback book ever again.THANK YOU FOR ALSO SAVING SOO MANY TREES.Sincerly,Tina Port P.S.I am now your very Loyal and greatful cusomer,HAPPY HOLIDAYS"
2,am i suppose to read it?,I bought it cuz the cover was cool but didn't read it..yet..It has a beautiful front page. Can't deny that
2,a tale of two cities,Dribble......to descriptive....found myself saying...what were we talking about? What was the story line??? Listened to the beginning 3 or 4 times...before I gave up. The book just couldn't hold my attention! Boring!!!
3,Historical Sentimental Trivia,"This novel was published in weekly installments. I think Dickens was a bit absent minded in the first two books, because the plot is quite weak and flickering. In book three the intensity grows and resembles more a normal novel. The content of this novel is the most commonplace sentimental trivia. But apparently it has met the tastes of the audience at the time. Dickens is supposed to be a great writer, right? It's quite amazing that he could pour out this kitschy sentimental romantic trivia. Was he just calculating on the limited minds and romantic dispositions of his female audience to increase his sales? Or was he, after all, not that great a writer?"
3,It was ok but not that good......................,"This novel was good but not very good. m The events were exciting and interesting. But, the plots were confusing and events were intrined into description which made it very confusing. The part Monegnieur de Marquis is sloughtered is incessantly perplexing. The event, again, were good. However, the ending was not very good. You don't even know if the family gets back to England and Sydney Carton's head is chopped off. The description is magnificent. That's what I thought of ths novel."
2,Unsurpassed...yea right,"According to historical sources, Dickens was paid by the word for his books. Thus, I infer that the long, winded and boring passages Dickens exhibits in A Tale of Two Cities must indicate his greediness. Though I'm only 16, I can still identify well written books. If one is seeking a great novel, I suggest 1984 by George Orwell."
1,this sucked,"I really didnt like this book. It was slow and obnoxious in its slow pace. Lucie Mannette wasn't an admirable character and like a previous reviewer mentioned, pathetic as the single most mentioned female in the book. As a woman, I disliked the stereotype that Ms. Mannette enforced. Frankly, I'm surprised Dickens could publish this book at all."
5,Dickens is great,"The work is well written, clever and knowing. I read it in 7th grade and did not appreciate much of the humor, insight and lovely use of language. Read it again or read it for the first time. So many of Dickens' insights could apply to the current age and that is what makes it a classic."
4,Tale of Two Cities,I also chose this book based on someone saying it was a good book . I am hoping that it will be as good as they have said .
1,I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING,"I COULD NOT GET INTO THIS BOOK I DIDNOT UNDERSTAND IT'S CONTENTS IT WAS OLD ENGLISH IT WAS BORING , DULL"
2,"It was very ingenious, but quite boring to read!","I am a freshman in highschool and it is required to read Tale of Two Cities. Dickens is a very brilliant writer, practically a genious. But, the book is very boring to read, it is almost unbarable! I wouldn't even give the piece two stars if Dickens wasn't a legenday writer. I think this novel shouldn't be classified as required reading for freshman; no offense Dickens!"
4,"Not Top Dickens, but Still Great","I don't really feel qualified to write reviews of Dickens, but ""A Tale of Two Cities was not my favorite Dickens novel ever (not my least favorite, either). It is shorter than many of his books, and the plotting was tight. There were fewer memorable characters and incredible plot twists than usual, but of course there was brilliant description and witty dialogue. ""A Tale of Two Cities"" really is the story of the Revolution more than a particular person. The pace of the story picks up during the last 50 pages (although it is not too slow for the rest), and becomes quite exciting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Dickens or is interested in the French Revolution. So I give it 4 stars...only because Dickens did write ""Great Expectations"" and ""Our Mutual Friend""."
2,Books Do Not Play past a few paragraphs,Have found that the down loaded books only play a few chapter and stops. Have not found a way to hear the whole book. Again have tried a couple books with the same results. Will work with the kindle to see if I can over come this problem.
5,Cool movie,I haven't seen this movie since 1989-90. This is a classic that I can't wait to share with my friends. It brought back so many memories.
1,Not worth of buying this Book,"Before buying this book,I had high expectations because of price and author. But when I bought this book, I realized it is not worth of spending more than $5. I felt I dupped."
2,Pure conjecture,"This book began well, particularly with its dissemination of da Vinci's religious art. However, it went rapidly downhill from there as it went of on bizarre tangents regarding Mary Magdelene as some sort of priestess in the Eygptian cult of Isis, with Jesus as one of her acolytes. Its interesting, but where is the evidence to back it up? At no time do they produce any concrete foundations on which to build there argument. There were many times when I could have shredded this book in frustration!Come on Picknett and Prince - treat us as if we have brains!"
5,Wow!,"This is perhaps the single most comprehensive look at historical and heretical Christianity that I personally have ever read. Academically sound and thoroughly documented. If you can keep up with Picknett and Prince's heavy and intense documentation, then go for it. I casually picked this book up at the library, but was so fascinated by it that I went out and brought a copy at the bookstore, which I'm sure that I will gladly treasure for reference in the years to come. Again, the only complaint I have is understanding the very heavy academics that are involved in this work. Other than that, this is an amazing book."
3,possible bias,"Although I am the antichrist, yes the one of prophecy and myth, and thus have an inherent bias toward the subject matter of this book, I still feel an urge to comment upon it. Overall, it was a good read -- not great mind you, but good. The scholarship was sorely lacking, but this was partly made up for by the imaginative ideas of the writer. Anyway, as scion of the Merengovian line, I will soon be uniting Europe as well as all the major religions. Then I shall destroy the world. With such a pressing agenda I needed something to take me away -- this book was just the ticket. I, yes I, recommend it."
3,Another Templar Tale?,"Intriguing exploration. However, the Magdalene legend and Priory story are more likely to be Masonic fabrications. Those searching for something closer to the truth might consider: 'Christ Conspiracy' (Acharya) and 'That Old Time Religion' (Maxwell)."
3,Vertical Man Part 2,"Although I like the ""direction"" Mark Hudson has taken Ringo on the last few albums, the production is VERY noisy and loud in a sometimes annoying way. On most of the songs there are too many instruments for what the songs need. The production actually gets in the way of some of the songs for me. Also...most of the backing vocals are like finger nails on a calkboard to me. The songs themselves are pretty good. Not great though. Most of them sound like they could have been on Ringo's last album ""Vertical Man"". This album could be ""Part 2"" of that album. Ringo's drumming is great. His voice does sound rather good too. If they could have left half of the over dubs off and 3/4 of the backing vocals I would have probably given this 4 stars. I do hope Ringo can fine another producer next time. Maybe someone not so into The Beatles?"
2,Just OK,"I admittidly am not a huge Ringo fan. Yes, he played the drums for one of the most famous bands ever, but that does not make him a great drummer and what's more his songs don't need great drumming. 'Nough said.While I really enjoy some of his past hits, Ringo is not something I have much for replayabilty. And this album is fits right in. It was OK to listen to, but unless your a true Ringo fan, this album is not much to keep in the player to hear over and over."
3,Ringo does his thing,"Lets first set the expectations; Ringo Rama is not a 5 star CD nor as bad as one reviewer spewed about. All in all it contains a fairly inspired set of tracks. ""Eye to Eye"" is very good (the drumming is excellent), but the tribute to George, ""Never Without You"", falls flat. It's filled with overt references to George's songs and thus it comes off a bit goofy. Net, it's a solid CD for most, especially Beatle and Ringo fans."
2,A few decent ideas underneath all fluff,"Basically this album plays like a vanity project, and it shows, giving credence to the sentiment raised by cynics of the avant garde genre as being nothing but experimental pettiness. Amongst the half baked ideas lie some predominately aimless noodeling, with unjustified changes, overshadowing what remains as a ghost of a shell for an amazing album here. For every subtly smart move, there are two cheaply implemented moves to stimulate the edginess that this popster was in over his head making. Too bad the lack of direction kills this, for some reason it's synthesis of production elements made it fascinating to study the textures, and sadly wanting much more, length-wise as well.."
4,an honest potrayal of the truly unsatisfied,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. I don't understand why some people don't like it. Maybe it was made for a certain age group(25-35) or social group(music, common-cool, smoke & drink folks). Some of the people in Sleep With Me remind of friends I know. In fact, some of the characters remind me of myself. The dialogue is excellent. The spacing & conflicts do not seem forced. The actors(Stolz, Tilly, Craig?, Shelly?) are all remarkable. The characters are written honestly and without malice which I found to be entirely decent of the screenplay writers! It all worked for me. In this type of ""relationship"" movie, when the viewer feels more like they are on the screen than in a theatre, that is the sign of a truly great movie."
2,"The ""five minutes that saved the film"" category","The only reason to watch this film is for Quentin Tarantino's homoerotic speculations about ""Top Gun."" Other than that, the film is complete waste of talent (Stoltz, Meg Tilly, Shelly)."
4,Tight CD By Tha Masta of G-Funk,"This is a tight CD with great beats 4 the most part, and great lyrics 4 the most part. Best tracks are: Regulate, This Is the Shack, Recognize, Do You See, and This DJ. Check out this album. Peace!- C Dogg"
4,Not just a 2 song album,"Originally I baught this after hearing the samples of Regulate and This DJ. After buying the album that was mostly all that I listened to off of this for a while with the exception of Do You See. Eventually one day after listening to In So Many Ways it got stuck in my head, and the album just clicked - I became obsessed. My obsession was short lived, but I still love the album. The reason that I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is because there are 2 skits, so you only really get 10 songs which is not terrible, but could be better. Don't be fooled by this reveiw either, not ALL of the tracks are brilliant, but MOST of them are."
3,Impressive introduction to the G-Funk sound,"Refusing to take a seminarial back seat to his fellow Long Beach counterparts Dr. Dre & Snoop, Warren G releases ""Regulate...The G-Funk Era."" Filled with breezy, atmospheric, sun-splashed beats, typical of the palm tree ladened Long Beach sound. Warren G serves up an impressive and captivating introduction to the G-Funk sound. Noteworthy tracks include the west coast classic ""Regulate,"" the mellow, tweeked out sound of ""Do You See,"" and the pionner-speaker bumper ""This DJ."" Melodic flows and innovative delivery make this a remarkable debut and the perfect musical complementation for the car, the beach, or the mid-year barbecue."
1,radio edit ripoff,they should tell you up front that this is a radio edit. worst $5 i've spent. i would have been better off burning my money. stay away from this one unless you enjoy gaps and missing words in your music.
2,Convice people that you are a dummy,"Wendy Abraham supplements her popular ""Chinese for Dummies"" book with a more portable phrase book for travelers. While I'm sure the author had the best of intentions for learners that simply needed enough language to get by while on holiday, frequent misspellings of pronunciation along with haphazard - and occasionally incorrect - translation of items (such as four-character idioms) that the casual student of the language doesn't need anyway can only lead to misunderstanding and confusion. If normal character-based written entires were included with the text, the traveler could at least use the phrase book for pointing, but with only pinyin romanization (along with Abraham's persistent and distracting toneless phonetic approximations), this book will probably not help much with inevitable language gaps.Nathan Dummittauthor ofChinese Through Tone & Color"
5,This is not the best track of the Just Whitney-album...,"and still I give it 5 stars...says a lot about the album, huh?I love One of Those Days. It's such a pretty song, and so relaxed...I think Whitney's my new favourite artist :-) I'm gonna buy all her albums, she rocks!"
5,Pack Up The Troubles,"Sometimes, when I hear Whitney Houston's voice, I just melt away all my troubles and just relax. Her music has been very upbeat and dynamic. There are sometimes cases where I can hear a song from her and just dance when I'm all alone. That certainly is the case within this song. One Of Those Days has a laid back R&B vibe that truly should speak out, no matter what the troubles say. The song also samples big, sampling The Isley Brothers classic, Between The Sheets. When the song case out, I thought a lot of people could've used that song, because of the trauma the world was facing, and I still think it is worth hearing. People don't give Whitney that kind of credit that much these days. Sadly, from the heartbreak she had faced these past few years. Still, I strongly suggest you get this single. If not, go get Just Whitney. Trust me, you won't be sorry."
1,Un Wise,"Gary Ezzo is not qualified to give this advice. He has been discredited over and over, and dropped by his publishser. He continues to publish these on his own. Look up Gary Ezzo on the internet for the critiques of this material. He discourages talking to your teens about sex, right up to their wedding day."
5,Had Serious doubts!,"That horrible over ring you get, especially when in the studio can really drive you nuts! I heard of these rings from another drummer, who swore by them, so I purchased them. I figured, when they didn't work, or muffled the sound of my drums, I'd just recycle them, or use the small one to help me cut holes in my front bass drum head. Well, I till have them.How can something so thin, and seemingly fragile knock out the nasty overtones? It's just enough weight to do the job, while Not messing with the natural resonance of the head. They are Amazing. It's one of those, ""Why didn't I invent these,"" kind of things.They are simple, cheap, and very effective.If you play with fans blowing on you, like some of us do, you might want to put a little post it note like stick-em on them, as they tendto take off when the wind hits them. Otherwise, if you want to get rid of that nasty over ring, I would highly recommend these."
5,One of the best Swami Rama Books,"I have read many books by Swami Rama, and this is one of his best works. May be more for the advanced student. The last chapter carried a profound message for me."
4,Noisy Cassette Adapter,Good for the price. Used the player in my car for a month. Sound is not bad. Antiskip works fine. The only thing I do not like is the noisy cassette adapter.
5,SUPERSTAR...VIKKI CARR,"Buy it, find it, and sit back and listen to oneof the most talented songstress of the 1960'sput on a show for you. I also heard this wasalso released on VHS format as well.A true SUPERSTAR!"
5,Loved it!,"What more can one say? Great historical information. Felt like I was really there. Wow, being royalty in those days wasn't exactly an advantage!"
3,"Not the best, but interesting",Definitely preferred The Other Boleyn Girl and The Virgin's Lover. I'm reading Earthly Joys. I didn't think the two Boleyn books tied together that well. But the three narrators were interesting and her take on Anne of Cleves was fascinating. I loved the fleshing out of these forgotten and yet so important historical figures. But Jane Boleyn was tough to believe and understand.
3,"Good historical details, but flat characters","This is the third Gregory book I've read, and I find that her characters consistently lack development. They are always a bit flat and one-sided, in contrast to the realistic details and intriguing historical settings of her novels. She's a decent historical fiction writer, but not the best."
5,The Boleyn Inheritance,"I LOVED this book! One of the best onesI have ever read. The author is fantastic!From this book, I am reading her other books."
2,A great disappointment,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews boasting of the excellence of this novel; it is a great disappointment to anyone who has read The Other Boleyn Girl, The Virgin's Lover and the The Queen's Fool. Much like the Constant Princess, this book is full of repetition--so much so that it is a wonder that Ms Gregory's editors let her get away with it. Her characters did not grow or change as a result of their ordeal, but, again and again repeated almost the very same words as those said in the previous chapter. While the conceit of the story is interesting--telling the tale from the point of view of each of the 3 female protaganists, the execution is amateur. In truth, this book should be no more than a few chapters long. As I said, a great disappointment that must be laid at the feet of Ms. Gregory's need to publish a book each year. This is my 6th Gregory book and the last that I will read."
1,Not her best!,I found this book boring and an awkward read. Phillipa Gregory's other books were MUCH better and more interesting! Wish I had waited until it came out in paperback OR had a higher discounted price!!!
3,Not what I expected,"I guess I should have read a bit more about the description. This is not a full size book, it is small and I don't like this size."
3,Disappointing,"I loved the Other Boleyn Girl, so I was excited about picking up this sequel. Although it was readable and I enjoyed bits here and there, like a few other reviewers, I found the book INCREDIBLY repetitive. Jane's sections were the worst with the ""how I loved George...no, I must not think of it."" Over and over and over again. And after TOBG, I couldn't buy Jane as someone mournful of George and Anne. Anne of Cleves was generally dull and repetitive (although not as bad as the other two). I found Kitty Howard's sections the most amusing because she had a unique ""voice"" and some of her stupidity made me laugh, but even she was insanely repetitive (""the king is fat,"" ""the king stinks,"" over and over and over again).It wasn't a good book or a bad book, it just wasn't anywhere near as good as the Other Boleyn Girl."
3,A bit dissapointing,"I was a bit dissapionted with The Boleyn Inheritance. After reading The Other Boleyn Girl and absolutly LOVING it I immediatly rushed out to the bookstore and bought this book expecting the same, or an even better experience. The plot moves along slow with a few jumps every now and then but it was hard for me to get through. I really had to force myself to finish it. It took me a month to read this book because I couldn't focus on it for that long because at times I found myself well...bored. Now while the imagery and description is absolutly beautiful the plot is just eh. I will continue reading Phillipa's books because I still do consider her tp be the best historical fiction writer out there,I mean you can tell that she does her research. But as far as recommending this book to other people well...I just can't bring myself to do it."
2,A Disappointing Sequel,"I enjoy Hickam. I found The Keeper's Son to be a particularly good read; it was believable, well crafted, exciting and informative. In short, all the things one likes in a book. The Ambassador's Son was touted to be its immediate sequel. Perhaps. It struck me as contrived, formulaic, short on logic and long on suspension of belief and coincidence. In short, a major disappointment. This book is a miss. Too bad"
2,Sorry...,My wife and I love Govi's music but am little tired that he keeps re-doing the same music over and over.
2,Lowered Test Score,"I don't see how it would be possible for a review guide to lower your SAT score but it happened. My math score remained unchanged while my verbal went down 20 pts. I was very disappointed. However, I did study the Cliff Notes ACT Review book as well and it boosted my composite by 3 points, (and math, my weakest from a 20 to a 24)."
3,Decent introduction to the Conclave; Nice College of Cardinals Dictionary.,"This is an interesting book that is perhaps most valuable for its index of (at the time) eligible Cardinals that is found in the back with detailed summaries of the history of each eminence.I think that John Allen does a pretty good job at presenting an introduction to the conclave process prior to the actual 2005 happening.While not the best of Allen's work, it is a nice addition to any Vatican watcher's library.Give it a shot."
4,Electrelane - 'Rock It To The Moon' (Mr.Lady),"Coming to you straight out of Brighton,UK.'Rock It...' is the all-female electronic/Avant Garde band's first release,as they have one other that came out as it's follow-up.The gals were supposed to play a pub in my area fairly recent,but the gig was apparently cancelled.If this CD is any indication,they should be decent to see live.Tracks that I thought carried some weight were ""Gabriel""(nice keyboard work),""Blue Stranggler"",the krautrock-ish ""Long Dark"" and ""U.O.R."".Line-up:Mia Clarke-guitar,Rachel Dalley-bass,Verity Susman-keyboards and Emma Gaze-drums.Might appeal to fans of Sonic Youth,Stereolab,PJ Harvey and KaitO.A very decent find."
1,"This is propoganda with a ""false hook""","I feel like i got cheated. The first two books were bearable but this third one undid any value in the first two. Unless you are a fundamentalist Christian (with a very narrow interpretation of the Bible) these are not for you. As one reviewer already noted, the characters are weak. Additionally, the end of this third book is a complete let down. Contrary to the reviews printed on the book jacket, there is little erudition and the author's interpretation of many of the referenced passages in the Bible are highly questionnable. This is not fiction, this is propoganda with a false hook."
2,Let down...,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that said the book ends with a ""what the?"". The books are well written and build towards something interesting, but in the end I felt duped and slapped in the face with a fish! It felt like the author pulled a fast one on a segment of his readers. I was told about this book by someone in Amazon who wrote ""if you like Dan Brown you'll love James Beauseigneur"". They are NOT similar! If you think you're going to get something like that, you will be disappointed."
2,Wraps things up a little too quickly,"In this third and last book in the series, the author wraps up all nagging questions and creates the ""Final Battle."" It seems that all things just resolved themself way too quickly. The author has a good grasp on Christian theology and seems to explain the things that happen well. His explaination of the coming of Jesus to defeat the anti-christ is one example. I just found, and I find this a lot with series, the resolution to be too convenient. On the whole, I enjoyed the series and would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in end-times fiction. It is an interesting ""what if"" kind of book."
1,Tired rehash,"We've seen all this done many times before and far, far better. The writing is terribly amateurish and adolescent -- like an angst-filled teenager trying to wax intelligent. The storyline is predictable and tiresome (and derivative of many other works which are all inifinitely superior to this cliche). If you're into Hanger 51 and Roswell, you'll just love the ridiculous ending. A waste of good trees."
5,Acts of God,A wonderful book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading and passing on to my children. It was captivating and a remarkably reasonable portrayal of the second coming of Christ for His blood-bought church.
2,Uncomfortable,"As others have mentioned, the padded rest becomes uncomfortable after using the pad for a few minutes. It is simply too hard.Also, with older MS mice, the pad does not register correctly and is unusable. With newer mice, this does not seem to be an issue."
3,it is lighter weight.,"U used to B able to get mousepads anywhere anytime, but over the last few years I've only been able to find blue, gray, or black, with or without wrist rests. This is colorful and it is lighter weight."
4,Exactly what I expected,"This simple product supports the wrist as you use your mouse. I find it releives stress on the hand. It's covered in slick nylon fabric. It works just the way I had hoped. Like the model T, it comes in black, or black."
2,Buy something else.,I haven't had this long but it's already got a dent a mile deep from resting my hand on it. I got this because i had bad pains in my wrist and was hoping this would help. Well I'm disappointed. I know I didn't pay much for it in the first place but I would have spent a little more to get a better pad.
3,Ok for the price,"For $8 don't expect anything too great.Pros:1) Doesn't take up too much space2) Doesn't move around and is not sticky3) The wave rest gel pad is comfortableCons:1) It has an extremely strong chemical smell.2) Makes an annoying ""swishing"" sound when you move your mouse aroundWould I buy it again? Only if it was $4."
2,"Literally coming apart. I think I got a lemon, tho'. 4 months old.","I had a Belkin mouse pad like this for at least 6 years, possibly longer, and it was still going strong, in perfect shape when I gave it to my aunt and got myself a new one about 4 months ago.As stated in my headline, I seem to have a lemon this time. The fabric that's supposed to be ""welded"" tight over the entire surface of the pad like skin has pulled away from about 30% of the surface, and is continuing to do so.I called Belkin - which was no fun, btw - and they're going to replace it ... AS LONG AS I first send them this faulty one, paying the postage. That means I'll probably have to go for a few weeks without a mouse pad. Drats!Because of my experience with the previous pad, I'm going to try again. I figure my chances of getting another lemon are slim. However, if this is representative of the way they're currently made ... well, I'll worry about that bridge if and when I come to it."
4,good not great,"For the price this is a good buy especially if your like me and spend most of your day on the computer. The pad has not conformed to my wrist yet but I have only had it for a month. The bottom is grippy enough to not move and very thin all the samePros:Great gripActual pad is thinCons:""Memory foam"" still at stock shape after a heavy months usageSlightly too big for keyboard shelve under desk"
2,Disappointing,"I've owned a few of these before, but for some reason the gel rest on this one is different, and not in a good way. It's definitely much firmer than before, and while it's not like resting your wrist on a rock, it's close."
1,Smells terrible,I couldn't stand the smell so I returned it. I recommend getting something else unless your computer is under a fume hood.
1,Belkin Mouse Pad,"Pad was comfortable and worked well; however, was made in China and had an odor that bothered my sinus. Had to return item for a refund."
1,Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad (Black),"I purchased this because it was reasonable, but unfortunately it was useless. The so-called jelly support shrunk to a depression bordered by two hardened ridges that cause blocked circulation, numbness and pain when using the mouse. If you do not want instant carpal tunnel syndrome, spend a little more and get a real jelly-filled support.Belkin WaveRest Gel Mouse Pad (Black)"
2,"""WaveRest"" shape bothers my hand","I am just looking for a mousepad with a wrist rest. Why is this so difficult? I bought this one just because the non-oval shaped mousepad looks to fit better in the space I have available on my desk. However, when I tried it out the ""waverest"" which I am assuming is what we should call the indent in the wrist rest area is strangely uncomfortable. Like other reviews, it's true that the rest is hard and more like a foam insert rather than a gel insert, but the most annoying thing to me is the indent in the rest which makes positioning my hand feel awkward. I don't know if I can return it since I opened it, but I definitely plan on getting a different one."
2,"Supports the wrist, but bad for laser mouse","The shiny black surface reflects a laser mouse erratically. I had to throw another white mouse pad on over top of it, which looks pretty lame, but does the trick. The wrist support is fine, and the smell only lasts for the first few days of use (or maybe I just got used to it)."
5,"good wrist support, stylish","I live at my computers, so I consider the ergonomics vital. I bought this mousepad explicitly for the wrist-support, which it does very well.The wrist-portion is firm, with the top flattened and contoured to match the bottom of your wrist. The material in that area is a shiny black finish which seems like it will wear well. It is very firm though, with little-to-no give in the gel, so if you want a cushy support, look elsewhere.The flat portion of the pad is a little small, so if you have a full-sized mouse set to low-sensitivity, you may run off the edge. The material made some dragging/friction sounds against the bottom of my Logitech MX1100 for the first few days of use but then wore smooth.Recommended.Update 03/2010: After more than a year of heavy usage, this mousepad surface and material remain in very good shape, no pilling or discoloring. Still Recommended."
4,Gel Filled Mouse Pad,"This was a life saver. I can rest my wrist on it ,and not worry about getting that CT. I never saw this item before and it was a life saver.I was using a rolled up towel to put under my wrist.I would highly recomend this product, especially if you are worried about your wrists getting sick...."
2,it is garbage,"garbage garbage garbage garbage ga * Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?* How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it."
4,a good mouse pad,bought this for my middle-aged mother and she really likes it. The rest bar is very comfortable and really helps her when she is spending long hours doing family history research.
1,Horrible!!,"Just got this today, 2/21/12, and it is absolutely horrible! This will likely cause you wrist pain. The wrist rest is hard as a rock and not built well. It also reeks like nothing else and smells heavily of chemicals. I usually trust Belkin's products, but this is a piece of crap. Will be buying different brand from now on."
1,Did not work with optical mouse.,"I have an optical mouse (the most common type these days) and it did not work on the black surface. The arm rest felt great, but since I don't have one of the older ball-type mice I could not use this item."
1,New... and TERRIBLE.,"I've always been a big fan of this mouse pad and recently ordered a new one for my home office. Like other recent reviewers note, this is NOT the same mouse pad Belkin used to make--the quality of it has significantly deteriorated.- The wrist rest is hard and uncomfortable, and the slight dip in the middle is now essentially a hollow space. If you squeeze it, you hear plastic crinkling inside.- The pad itself is much thinner.- The edges are not crimped to keep the layers together; I can see this peeling apart in no time.- Like another reviewer mentioned, the surface material is also oddly reflective, and it makes my mouse freak out (I use a Logitech Performance MX).Compared to the one at my office (which is years old but still works perfectly), this just feels thin and cheap. Guess I'll be moving on to the Innovera mouse pad now."
2,"Feels OK, does NOT track well","I haven't had too much of a problem with this mouse pad, but I have to say it is extremely frustrating that it doesn't track laser mouse as well as it claims. I get better traction on anything other than this mouse pad. I am disappointed to say the least and certainly will not be buying any more belkin products.Feels cheap, and the cheaper mouse pads my cheap employer uses work 10X as well. Ridiculous!/end rant"
2,Rest is much too hard,"Mouse pad is very nice, looks new after 1 year,but the pad is much too hard - and too narrow.It is indented in the middle, across the pad.I don't know if it is better than a plain pad."
2,"Didn't care for it -- wrist pad too firm, poor contour","This is nicely made, but my hand and wrist did not like the wrist rest. The ""gel"" pad is too firm for my taste, and it's contoured in such a way that it put too much pressure on my wrist.I threw it away and bought a Fellowes PlushTouch Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest (UPC 043859638802) which I like much better."
2,"this is not a ""gel"" pad","My old Belkin gel pad, after about 6 years of use, had worn down to the point where the center of the gel wrist rest had developed an indentation that was too low to be comfortable anymore. I was thrilled to find what looked like an exact replacement online; however, upon receiving the item, I was disappointed. This product advertises itself as a ""gel"" pad. My old one certainly was. The wrist rest was a gel soft enough to conform to your wrist, but still offer support to keep your wrist elevated. This new product's wrist rest is made of a much stiffer material, and although you can make a depression in it with your fingers, when you rest your wrist on it, the feeling is as if you were resting your wrist on a hard piece of plastic.If you're looking for the comfort that comes with true gel, this isn't the product for you. I'll be buying another mouse pad today."
2,Rendition,"Saw a billboard for this movie in Chicago. I thought it would be good just from the cast, but I was wrong. I bought it, but the movie is boring, changes story lines, and the viewer doesn't really care what happens to characters in the end. I recommend renting this instead of buying it."
4,Thought-provoking entertainment,"The film's main goal is entertainment, but it is nicely filled with political overtones that are truly thought-provoking. The cast makes up for a great ensemble, they all provide great performances. Nice international cast, by the way. This is a movie that unfortunately didn't do much business in theatres but sure is going to have a second life on home entertainment. It deserves to be seen."
4,Sad and depressing.,"How much you enjoy rendition will largely come down to your political and ethical feelings about the war on terror.As for the acting and the writing and directing, it is a great movie, and perhaps I am an old paranoid patriotic American, but I found the message, that America is evil, not quite accurate or helpful while we are at war. But I am sure that there are millions of people who will resound with the message.4* for effort and execution, and 2 1/2* for the message.But that's just me."
4,"GAVIN HOOD, OPUS 4","**** 2007. Directed by Gavin Hood. The C.I.A. secretly brings a suspect into a North African prison where he's tortured. Meanwhile, the suspect's wife tries to find help among politicians. This is the kind of movie nobody wants to see because it asks questions no one wants to hear. So be one of those who are assuming."
1,Dying to Get Published,"I checked the other reviews which sounded promising. I just could not get in to enjoying the book. After several chapters, I gave up."
3,lame ending,I felt the book was just kind of anti-climactic for me. The end either came too quick or wasn't very impressive. I was disappointed.
2,Not all that great,This wasn't a great book. It had a really hard to follow plot and it was a bit too slow starting off.This is definitly a book made for older audiences. I do not think that this is ment for teen/tweens.
2,"Weird, just . . . weird","The narrator is an unpublished author who has a grudge against a particularly harsh editor, and decides to kill her so she'll have a story. After getting through about 40% of this, I've decided it's not worth my time. However, due to the subject matter, I hope the author doesn't take my critique seriously. Seriously."
4,A fun romp,"As an author of multiple novelsLodestone (Witch-Hunt)I totally related to Jennifer Marsh, the main character. Her quirky antics made me laugh out loud. The secondary characters were rich and full of tricks too. This is a fun read and I'll certainly be buying other books in this series. I was surprised that overall others haven't rated this story higher. If you like a laugh,you should read this. And what would you rate it as?"
3,So-so,"An okay mystery to pass the time..at least I did finish it. This was the first of this series I have read, and I won't be reading any more. Too many references to previous fictional characters of Jennifer's that I couldn't relate to, and the imaginary future baby was a bit much."
1,Not Christian Fiction,"I am not sure why this book, Dying to Get Published is found under the search of ""Christian Fiction."" After reading just a small portion of the book, I found out that it has been mislabeled."
3,It sounded like a good idea at the time.,"Interesting idea, how many times at the end of an adventure in our own lives do we say, it sounded like a good idea at the time. So when I started this book, I was ready for an interesting ride. But, the author let me down. I think the charcters were wooden and much like stick figures in a drawing, and the story was just to predictable. However, I see promise for this writer and will gladly read another one."
2,Awful,"I hate to say it, having enjoyed the rest of Judy Fitzwater's series, but this opener to the series is excruciatingly dull. Read the rest, but avoid this one!"
1,Good attempt,"The fetus angle was silly and overdone. The fact that the mystery writer practically steps on someone near the scene of the crime who was outrageously attired and doesn't make the connection later was irritating. The humor was pretty good as was the way the author moved the story along (at least towards the end of the book). I found it unreal that an attractive woman like the protagonist seemed to view dating with the jitters of a woman who had just ended a 20-year marriage. Geez, she was only twenty-nine years old, surely she'd gone out a few times since high school!"
3,Dying to get published - slow to start with but gained momentum,I was unsure when I began reading if I would find it interesting enough to persevere but it did improve in interest rate .The elderly householder who took pity on the lead character was way too OTT! the details were farcical but then the group of old ladies acting like a Miss Marple support group was quite amusing. The ending was reasonably suspenseful.
2,"Good Idea, but blah","The book at first was exciting, but somewhere it lost my interest it made me sleepy! I think the idea was great but bang from the start lost it towards the middle"
5,Black beard beware,"Still my favorite razor, and the only one to cut my dark beard enough to allay the ""did you shave this morning"" comments. It also gives great comfort due to the vibrating handle, makes you wonder how and who invented that idea... mind boggles. Apart from that, what else can one say about a sharpened strip of metal except how do all the manufactures charge so much for them? But that's another discussion on cartels and not a review. Enjoy."
4,IT WAS GOOD,IT WAS GOOD AND IT WORKS WELL. IT SIMPLE TO USE EVERYONE. ALSO IT WAS PERFECT FOR BUSY PEOPLE.
4,THE COOLING FAN,"My sister recently bought 2 of these fans and I had to get 2 also because I really liked them....and of course, I like having the remote control. The fans work great for me !"
5,Excellent learning/teaching tool,"This is a great book. It covers shapes, colors, opposites, animals, the whole nine yards in a fun and interactive way that really engages and stimulates little minds. Best of all, it is REALLY durable!"
3,The picture is about actual size,That's a slight exageration depending on your screen size but it's a small book with just a few pages. Pretty much worth the inexpensive price. I bought it for my daughter to put my purchase over the limit for Super Saver Shipping. Just thought you should know.
4,Great book for toddlers!,"I bought this book for 2 year old twin girls that I used to Nanny for. They loved it but were a little tough on it. Most of the ""doors"" are ripped off."
4,Smaaaaaaall,"I was pretty mad when I got the book. It's so itty bitty. I assumed it was going to be a Normal size book, not a miniature. Should've read the reviews lol. Still a good book though."
1,"The horror, the horror...","ABC realizes they canceled the 24th most popular show on television. They pump out half a season of Galactica 1980. Pretend it never happened. Oh, Lord, say it never happened..."
1,junk it started smoking,"I had bought 2 for my house, one worked and one started smoking right after I plugged it in. I could not return it because I didn't take it out of the box for 4 months. target said too bad, I complained and never got anywhere."
1,Out of Date Product,"They sounded great but were used and only lasted a couple of months before needing repair, but SONY no longer services this item."
2,"dealer was fine, product was less than expected.","i bought this for my 86 year-old father (who insists he doesn't need hearing aids). i installed them as directed, however there is a problem with the volume. even with the volume turned up full on the headsets he couldn't hear the TV. (i tried them and the volume was still very low and i have no hearing issues whatsoever.) in order to get the volume up on the headphones WE HAD TO INCREASE THE VOLUME ON THE TV!! thus defeating the purpose of having the headphones in the first place! i called customer support and was told that because our TV didn't have a headphone jack there was just no solution for this. i find this ridiculous. so, make sure that the set that you will use this with has a headphone jack or the purchase will be pointless."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I was so excited about this book. A unanimous five star rating! This is unlike most science fiction books in that it is not set in the future, thus there is no futuristic technology (except for one item), and the science fiction deals purely with the evolution of the mind. That's interesting enough and the story is a good one. It is the manner in which the story is told that bothered me after a while. Sturgeon has a way of dragging you through page after page, without giving a clue to what in the world is going on until the very end of each section. Sort of like a more sadistic Steinbeck. It's constant through the book that way and I found it agonizing. This book would be complex enough without the mysterious literary style. That aside, the concept is great and the characters are interesting."
4,A Friend of the Indians-Savior of a People,"Near the end of the wild and free days on the plains, when the bison were almost gone and the Indians were moved to the reservations to starve and die, a man of courage and decency realized that a great people and culture were about to be exterminated by a corrupt branch of the federal government. Thomas Henry Tibbles devoted the later half of his life to fighting the federal bureaucracy which was systematically murdering the remanants of the Ponca Indians. The book tells Mr Tibbles story from his youth as farm child in Ohio and Illinois, his adventures in bleeding Kansas before the civil war, the years he spent with several tribes in Kansas and Nebraska and finally his winning fight to free the Indians from the corrupt reservation system. The story of his time with the Indians is well worth reading. Mostly, this is a great story of a man devoted to a worthwhile cause."
1,A COMPLETE JOKE!,"oh my god, LOLsave your money and stream it on netflix..even if someone offer's this movie for free, dont except it.i cant believe this actually was made. the people who made this movie seriously need to either quit the film business or go back to film school, ya know what, not even..quit the film biz all together,TOTAL JOKE."
2,Beware of the picture!,"I chose these sheets for two reasons - they appeared to be soft and warm like any good flannel should be (they are), and the were not fussy plaid or floral or gingham like some flannel sheets are. I do not like fussy floral patterns. I AVOID ever purchasing an item with such a pattern. So imagine my surprise when I opened the box from Amazon today to reveal yellow flannel sheets covered in an awful lilac and vine pattern! I would never have bought these sheets if I had known that the item shipped would be different from the item pictured.They ARE soft and snuggly and warm, so if you LIKE floral sheets, they're fine. I just don't, and I'm extremely disappointed.UPDATE - The photo now reflects the actual pattern on the sheets."
2,"Well, at least the right picture is up","I thought I was ordering solid yellow sheets and got something with grapes on it. Sent it back. Just opened my new box - it has grapes - but at least the background is yellow. I see they have corrected the picture though. Very strange, this has never happened with Amazon before. Off to check to see if it at least matches current yellow-pattern comforter."
4,a great set of flannel sheet,"Ah, white sale time!! Nothing a Scot loves more than a good bargain. I love flannel. Flannel is so cosy. Add in the fact they are plaid!! Well, how could I resist? They are a generous sheet, very strong flannel with high thread count.I love their muted colour. However, what I didn't like in an otherwise perfect set what the plaid is one sides. Previously sets I have purchased are the same on both sides. At the original high tag, I would have thought they would make the sheets plaid on both sides.They washed well, without too much shrinkage."
3,Smart Animals Find Way Home,"There were two dogs, and one cat. One dog was a bullterer, the other dog was a gold red lab, and the cat was a siamese. The cat had a close encounter with a links. In the book they fight three animals: a bear, a porqupine, and a links. In the end, I recommend that you go to your loacal library and check out this book and find out."
1,I really did not like this book.,"This book was very boring book. The reason I did not like this book because it did not have enough action.The book was about animals and I really don't like books about animals.The story had to many characters to remember.I love to read , but I did not enjoy reading this book."
5,Wonderful!,"I first saw this movie on Disney when I was about 9. Recently, over 20 years later, I was in Half Price Books and spotted the book so I bought it. I was intending to give it to my 10-year-old niece, but then I started reading it. I had tears in my eyes. It was so inspiring.This book is very symbolic of the Christian walk--through the wilderness, into the ""Promised Land"". We all need each other--nobody is an island. We cannot go it alone. Like the animals in this book. They stay together and help each other all along the way. You can learn so much from this book!"
3,The Incredible Journey Review,This book was ok I kind of liked and kind of not. And this was the only one I gave a 3 star and less.
5,The Monkiest Monk you can get!,"This album really gives you the essence of Monk - his brilliant compositions, remarkable work on the standards, collaboration with wacky musicians such as the great Charlie Rouse (with the rest of the band - Frankie Dunlop on drums and John Ore on bass - being equally convincing!)...Since other reviews gave elaborate analysis of this album, I just wanted to add my 5 stars...It's produced by Teo Macero, baroness Pannonica wrote the original liner notes and Dick Katz wrote the new liner notes..."
2,sports bra,I usually like champion sports bras but this one is very large between the shoulders so when I put one on my shoulder blades rub a blister into my skin because the material is too wide in between my shoulders. Other than that I love the reversible feature and the actual feel of the material itself..
3,Cuts into the arm pit!,"This bra was soft and smooth, but it comes up really high under the arm pit. Usually I have the opposite problem that the straps are too long and the bra is too low. I sent it back for a refund. I could not handle the bra digging into my arm pits!"
2,SO DISAPPOINTING,"Very few to say about this new opus; though I am a real Lisa Stansfield fan, this new CD is close to a disaster. Let's forget it ASAP. I hope that she will be back very soon with a better songs selection."
4,I Wish Someone Had Told Me Too,This book describes some very real life experiences and Barbie has managed to capture and relate those experiences in this book in a wonderful way that encouraged me and brought me closer in my walk with our Heavenly Father.
5,Beatiful soul and exordinaly courage of an ordinary person,"Julianne Moore plays a housewife with seemingly perfect life who finds out how her life was nothing but perfect. When the wife struggled with her husband's homosexuality, she found only person who stood by her with no judgmental was an African American Gardner. Sadly, the racism & bigotry surrounded them was bigger than what they controlled to maintain their friendship in 50's. All of the tragedy that the wife experienced, I thought this movie gives us a clear message that the wife will empower herself with the hope for idealism of fairness she found in herself as well as in a Gardner."
2,"Good performances, lackluster movie","I cannot understand why this movie is getting such tremendous praise. I thought it was an ok movie, but it wasn't resonanting in my mind very long as other movies this year did. I thought more of the story about how Julianne Moore's, who did do an excellent job, charcter felt about her husband's extra-marital activities could have been explored. When she found out, it was like she didn't really care. Maybe it was, because she already knew insde, but that was never conveyed to the audience. I thought that the 50's thing became too cheeky. I wasn't sure if the movie was supposed to be funny or serious. A little of the ""swells' and ""pops"" would have been fine, but, to me, it crossed the line to being too much. One good thing about this movie was the colors; the cinematographer did do a great. The movie could have been great if the writer and director stuck more to providing a good, moving story rather than to making a 50's homage."
1,I am glad that the dvd romote got a 8X fast forward,"what a plain and boring movie! the script is so loose and the acting, so contrite and strained like watching a staged play. the ghost in the closet turned out to be a big nada. all i saw was mucho people dressed up in the 50s', with lot of old cars driving around to enforce that period. hollow script, hollow acting. don't know what's the big deal of this movie. had to use 8X fast forward to finish it, or, well, did i finish it?"
4,"Nice film, good acting, great images","I enjoyed this film on many levels. The images of the 50's are excellant and the acting was inspired. The script was good and the story was believable. In a nutshell this was a good film and it did draw you in, make you think and feel the tention. It is heavy and not a feel good film. It's dark and reminds us of the cost paid by those who tried to play the game and failed. A good film worthy of a look."
2,"Wooden, Tiresomely Predictable, and Condescending to Boot","Ah yes, those laughable people in their two-dimensional suburban lives. How unworldly and repressed they were. How unlike ourselves, we of the modern, cosmopolitan, hyper-educated elite. Aren't we so much cleverer than they were?This movie was incredibly tiresome. It was smug and conceited. It painted two-dimensional characters and then maneuvered them through a dreadfully obvious plot that shed no light on the past, and reflected painfully clearly the self-satisfied smirks of the people who put it together.Movies and their creators need to respect their subjects and their audience. This movie does neither. Don't waste your time."
4,Good old-fashion movie,"having been raised on the 1940's and 50's movies, it is very nice seeing one done in that style again. It just goes to show that you can a have a very good movie without have naked people, car chases, and blood and guts all over the place. I hope they do more movies of this type. It is also refreshing to see a happy ending for a gay person, i.e. the love interest stays, and the gay person doesn't die!!"
3,unsatisfying drama,"I wanted to like Far from Heaven. The opening shot is exquisite and I couldn't wait to see what would follow. Unfortunately not much or not enough. What is drawing so much praise here, Todd Haynes decision to recreate a long gone genre was an interesting experiment. But ultimately it got in the way. The scenes didn't breathe, the actors didn't connect. While I thought the style was cool; the music, the credits, the whole thing-- in the end the it all seem contrived and overdirected. Too much from the head. Not enough from the heart. The only actress that seemed alive was Juliane Moore's best friend. Everyone else seemed to be in a daze."
3,"Great for casual or new fans, somewhat disappointing for long-time fans.","Picture and sound quality of concert are very good. Concert itself is edited for this DVD: The songs I'm Not Talking, Ride the Ride and You Were On My Mind were omitted as well as the Waiting For My Man part from Manic Monday and the Mrs. Robinson part from Walk Like An Egyptian. Banter between songs was edited. Commentary by the band members (minus Michael Steele) had some good bits, but mostly anecdotes that long time fans have heard before. The photo sections were basically photos that long time fans are already familiar with. The interview with the band members (minus Michael Steele), while being pretty recent, covered the history of the band - again, die-hard fans should know this stuff by heart now.If you're a new or casual fan of the Bangles, the issues I brought up shouldn't be a problem for you."
5,"At last, a Bangles Live Concert (DVD)!","I'm an older Spanish fan of The Bangles (since Everything Lp) but I never have the opportunity to see The Bangles in concert (not in Spain). So, this is an incredible DVD for me. My loved Bangles are older too but they play and sing very well. They keep fit! I don't understand why we've waited nearly 7 years to see this concert (recorded in 2000), or why there's no more available Live material about The Bangles. Watching this dvd makes me wonder how they played in the past. In ""Angels don't fall in love"" Susanna stops playing her guitar to ""play"" Vicky's guitar!!!! What didn't do in the 80's? I rate this DVD with 5 because it's the first Live dvd but I would prefer to wait the Region 2 version, maybe it would have subtitles so I understand the band interview better. Thank you for the release of this DVD. I'll hope more Bangles Live concerts."
5,Great version,Love the remastered version of this album. Sound quality is far better than the older versions I ripped from my CD years ago.
4,Pink Floyd Animals,"Even though this is remastered, the sound quality still not the greatest. HOWEVER, it has some excellent songs with really good guitar and bass work. The seller was very good with getting product to me fast and as advertised. Good price also. Would buy from seller again."
1,Buyer Beware !!!!!!,"WARNING: I have two copies of this CD and they both contain an audible ""glitch"" during the song ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun""... which makes me wonder... is this a fake CD with EMI labels on the cover, intended to look official (it's hard to imagine EMI releasing something with such a clear sonic deficiancy).Furthermore, the recording level of ""Animals"" is much much lower than that of ""Saucerful Of Secrets"", which is a great deal louder (it makes you jump out of your seat when one album closes and the second one begins...!!). Anyone else agree....??"
3,eaarlier works seemed less commercial,"a small tidbit for all of us after""meddle"",""wish you were here"",etc."
2,Animal's is not all it's cracked up to be,"This over-ambitious prelude to The Wall is, well...boring. There are 4 songs on the album )no variety) and all of the songs are like 10 minutes. THis would be a good thing but Pik Floyd has a tendency to fill up time with boring crap. The middle of Dogs is like this (and so is all of sheep). Pigs on the wing really is pointless. The only song that stands out is Pigs (three different ones). THis is a great song. Bottom line-If you are a diehard floyd fan get it for pigs. otherwise dont waste your cash."
5,great album from a great band,Animals is one of my favourite albums from the great pink floyd and songs like sheep and dogs have made this a classic.hugely recommended.
2,Animals: Success Spoiled Pink Floyd,"One of the great pleasures of all classic Pink Floyd albums is that they all contain an element of humor. ""Ummagummma"", ""Atom Heart Mother"", ""Meddle"" and even ""Dark Side"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" share this quality. No surprise, each is a classic in its own right (although I'm not always so sure about""Wish...).After the success of ""Dark Side"", the band seemed to think that they had to get profound, and that just made them dreary. ""Wish You Were Here"" gets away with it, its a Requiem, but ""Animals"" goes off the deep end and there's no turning back. After that, its terminal dreariness for Pink Floyd. Or so it would seem.FYI - The main songs from both ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Animals"" were first performed on Pink Floyd '74 ""Dark Side"" tour. The tunes ""Raving and Drooling"" and ""You Gotta Be Crazy"" became ""Animals"". Both were better than the later versions that appeared on the album."
3,The Beginning of the End,"I used to think this was five stars in my youth, but now listening to it some 25 years later, I think Animals is the beginning of the end of Pink Floyd. This is where Rodger Waters' darkness starts to take over the band and it will eventually lead to The Wall and then their breakup. Although, according to Rodger, the band wasn't into it anymore after Wish You Were Here (except for Gillmore). This is probably true since Waters bought in studio musicans for The Wall. The concept of people either being catagorized as Pigs, Dogs, or Sheep was cool when I first heard it, but now I think that concept is inane. As a matter of fact, it makes the album NO FUN compared with Dark Side, and Wish You Were Here. Musically, it is one of their best. Gillmore does quite well with the acoustic guitars and the dog bark sounds and the Pig sounds etc. If you are new to Floyd, your safe bet is Dark Side or Wish You Were Here. If you're really into those and want more then buying this can't hurt."
2,What were they thinking?,"Animals is perhads the worst Pink Floyd album I ever heard. The songs seem to go on forever, the lyrics are bad, and Roger Waters' singing is not much better. So who Knows what they were thinking when they made this album.I hate to say it but the only reason I didn't give this album a one star rating was the two part song ""Pigs on the Wing"" which unlike the rest of Animals is actually a half decent song."
1,Animals,"Of course, the early Floyd stuff is undeservedly obscure compared to Dark Side and The Wall, but this one is a little underplayed too. A classic-rock station in my neck of the woods occasionally plays ""Pigs on the Wing,"" but that's about it. Considering that the two tracks which begin and end this CD aren't really songs, at least they're like insignificant ditties tossed in for no good reason. I don't get the concept of this record; maybe it doesn't stand together sufficiently or maybe there is no theme to it. Why listen then, but for the songs? What songs? I think The Division Bell and the other non-RW stuff is patterned after this--if you want to see that phase as more than just self-parody. It certainly doesn't have the memorable songs of Wish You Were Here or even The Wall, or the concept which linked the songs on those CDs together. In fact, I see Animals as a real insult to fans who might unfortunately buy the hype over Pink Floyd. But if they liked it, everyone wins, right?"
4,"Rich, atmospheric music with disturbingly brilliant lyrics","The opening and closing pieces, which are essentially identical, set the tone well with their lulling guitar chords. ""Dogs"" is absolutely brilliant--it haunts me every time I listen to it. Do ""Dogs"" with headphones and the lyrics for the full effect. ""Pigs"" is good, but I've always thought it was overrated. Waters' vocals are especially grating on it. ""Sheep"" is also brilliant. The CD is certainly a must for anyone who is still discovering Pink Floyd."
2,PF's WORST album ever,"I firmly agree with the previous poster who called this album ""mediocre"". Perfect choice of words- this album is, indeed, quite mediocre. Of course, the post-Waters albums are worse than this, but that's not saying much. This album is total crap. CRAPOLA. The vocals are wooden and uninteresting, with warmed-over 70's heavy metal. Obviously, ""Pigs on the Wing"" 1 & 2 is nice, but as has been pointed out, can be obtained on the Internet in combined form. Of the three central compositions, ""Pigs"" is the only very listenable track, but like the others, it suffers from its needless length. ""Dogs"" is absurdly turgid, and ""Sheep"" is unconvincing and ill-concieved. When you come down to it, this album is nothing more than three insanely bloated compositions that would've been better as five-minute songs each. Avoid."
5,just magnificent,"animals is one of pink floyd's less kown albums but I don't know why , it's almost perfect , it has great lyrics , great guitar , great bass , great everything and it rocks , go buy it right now"
3,Dulls quickly,"I live on Maui and do landscaping so you can imagine what I put tools through. I do like this mini brush hook / machete thing a ma bob but I'm bummed at how quickly it dulls. I contacted Fiskars and they said I should buy a Dremel tool with the sharpening stone kit. Really? Can't they just use better quality steel and sharpen it better in CHINA? Yeah, more chinese stuff, like we need more stuff from China. Not that their stuff is all bad but it isn't Fiskars quality if you ask me. In any case be ready to do a lot of sharpening after it first gets dull."
4,Great tool for briars,"This is a great tool once you sharpen it beyond the factory edge. I used a bastard file and diamond sharpener, then cleared a large swath of blackberry briars. Works great with these (and even saplings) when cutting at an angle against the stem... but with other less woody brush, it cuts cleanly at right angles. The handle also easily keeps the tool in a tired hand after hours of swinging."
4,An informative book on espionage,"This book is a great book if you are looking for a certain piece of information. It isn't the type of book you sit down and read for an hour. It is very informative and contains a lot of entries about spy equipment, agencies, and operations of a spy."
3,"Okay, but not great","What I wanted in purchasing this book was a book that would teach me how to speak elvish. It does a pretty good job of explaining the basics and foundation of the language, but it does not mention any words that were not mentioned in the LOTR books. It's a good starting step, but not a complete lesson."
4,Quiet and fit Dell 4600,"Working fine but the instructions could have been a little more thorough. My Dell 4600 uses a 20pin connection so I broke off the 4pin and mistakenly thought it went to the 4pin connection on the other side of the board. I cut the nice/neat loom and pulled the 4pin over to find it didn't fit, spliced on my old plug and the pc didn't start. Then I found the proper 4pin(two yellow, two black) tied up with the pci-e plug I didn't need. Plugged it in and pc started up fine, so I guess I didn't hurt anything. Should now have plenty of power for the AIW tuner card, TV Wonder, SoundBlaster and the Q-see DVR card. Every slots full on the old Dell now. Don't know why the video card fan quieted down unless it just liked the power boost, it's quit sounding like a coffee grinder. Alls well that ends well I guess."
4,Excellent blues with some swing influences,"This album should be great for any swing revivalists. It's blues, but there's a lot of swing and 40s influence to be found here. Great musicianship and a smooth vocalist. If you like blues or swing, pick this one up!"
1,terrible,"I'm sorry, but I've never had a worse textbook for a programming class. I actually took this class at Syracuse University with Professor Hansen, but it didn't help much. My advice for most readers out there would definitely be not to buy this book. It gives little to no explanation for any action keywords that are used in java, and in order to use the book, you have to get his own special text program to use the classes he calls for. The one redeeming factor is the examples in the book, which are not plentiful, but are well thought out and insightful. But on the overall, don't buy this book!"
2,Not terrific,"I purchased this as I have other volumes from this set which I love, but this volume was disappointing. The recording quality and renditions are not as good as the other volumes, which is unusual. It does not stand on its own, but buy it if you feel you have to have the complete set."
4,bright braa tub spout,"The finish matches my old Moen and seems to be durable,and it's not plastic. As with most tub spouts the female 1/2"" connection is about 6 inches into the spout. It is excatly what I wnated."
3,Love the cover,"Saw the cover of this book online a while ago and finally just read it based on how beautiful the cover is. The book is entertaining but if you really want to know the real story you should look on Amazon for ""The Good Women of China: Hidden Voices"" by Xinran Xue. This book will make ""Balzac and ........"" look like a Disney cartoon in comparison! It is one of the most moving and effecting reports by individual women of all ages in China of what it means to be a woman there. Reading this book will change your persective on your own life."
3,sweet little book,This is a quick book to read and pleasant. Avid readers will identify with the love the main characters have for books. The book also provides a glimpse into an interesting time and place. A good book; not a great book.
3,Just Not Enough For Me,"I thought this was an interesting story. But, I am not a fan of the short story or novella so I didn't find it satisfying. For those of you who love short stories you might just love this...?But I would have liked more of everything...I would have liked more details and more character development.I was curious about the time in history and would have liked to hear even more about the politics and the process of re-education. I would have liked to learn more about our narrator and his relationship with Luo...and more about Luo's relationship with the Little Seamstress.More would have been better for me. Short stories often feel like outlines for novels to me and this one did as well. I needed more details to feel the emotions between the characters.Overall, I thought the story was interesting but it just wasn't detailed enough to give me a satisfied feeling when I was done."
4,MY REVIEW,"Well, I thought this book was wonderful. I enjoyed reading it, becuase it was real. The whole book was based on a true story and I found that intersting. It teahes a lot about life and how things always don't go you're way and how things can change in the life that we call ""ours"""
4,Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. When I first started reading, I was a little apprehensive, but as soon at the stories of Luo and that narrator's lives came about, I was hooked. I learned so much about the Chinese Revolution that I had not previously studied in school. The friendship and the eagerness to read, in both of the boys, made the book that much more enjoyable. The comic relief also made the story very interesting. I would have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone."
3,"Easy read, but didn't love it","I found the book to be a bit Eurocentric. The foreign books opened up a new world to the two boys, it made the Western world seem so great, yet if they were to have found a box of classical Chinese books, the results could have been same. Of course the tragedy of the culture revolution cannot be overlooked; neither can the beauty and stories of the Chinese history.I also thought the story didn't develop enough, especially at the end. Dai very sloppy did not handle the little seamstress' distress nor did he explain what happened between the two friends as a result of what took place. Towards the end, loose ends were gathered up too hastily and left me unsatisfied."
3,Characters without destination,"An interesting story. The author is obviously a good writer, and her description of life after the cultural revolution and re-education are very good. The characters are interesting and well written. However, the story is lacking in plot which makes the ending seem abrupt and pointless. I wanted her to do something with these characters, but she never really did. A bit disappointing, even though I did learn about China under Mao."
3,Defenders of the Written Word Unite!,"When the parents of two boyhood friends are declared class enemies by Mao's regime, their sons are sent to a remote mountain village to be""re-educated"" by the peasant class. When the boys come across a stash of contraband Western classics, they seek a different way of ""re-educating"" themselves, as well as their new friend, the tailor's daughter (known only to the reader as the Little Seamstress). This intriguing premise will reel in any dedicated lover of literature, forcing them to face the painful question: what if it was a crime to read your favorite books? While the author handles his story well enough, the inevitable love triangle between the three young people is poorly developed and nearly undermines the tale's sense of tragedy. A lovely but flawed short novel that will enthrall book-lovers and defenders of the written word everywhere."
1,Might not work with a newer computer,"If you have a very old computer, it might be useful, but will not download on my year old laptop"
3,Like Funkitron Scrabble,"This game was given from Amazon me by one of my nieces, but I already had Funkitron Scrabble.This version was okay, I do like the email ability but didn't try it, but I think I like the Funkitron one better. It was easier to use, and plus I don't need a cdrom for it.Sue Williams"
4,Pass the Peas Again & Again,This is a great book to introduce manners to your young children. My two year old loved it & now at 3 we still love it. Each page is a different situation in which appropriate & kind actions are explained. The critters in the scene may want to do something else but they are learning how to be kind & have good manners. It is helpful for my child to see the manners modeled so she will learn what to do too! We love pass the peas please.
3,"good film, okay action, horrible editing","this was a great film to watch, moments of humor, lots of action including good but not great kung fu, guns, swords, horses... epic story of friendship, love, betrayal, redemption. takeshi kaneshiro is a good lead in an action movie but doesn't rank with jet, jackie, sammo, or yuen in terms of actual fighting. his charm and looks make up for it though.the one awful thing about this movie is the last fight scene. they simply don't show a very important part of it, a crucial scene for every action movie. i don't know how it could have been cut because of violence or blood because there was plenty of both throughout the film. it was almost as if they wanted to deny the viewer the satisfaction, and i heard from other online sources that this is the only english version of the film. it really makes you mad cuz you sit through the entire film and they cheat you at the end.see it if you want, and just make up your own ending."
3,Great Details and insight.,"As a newbie to Steelhead and Salmon drift fishing, I bought three reference guides including this book by Tim. One book I tossed out..to general...another has very nice color photographs and some good basics, but, Tims book has the details that I appreciated reading and highlighting for future quick referral. It is true, the beginning was somewhat disjointed, but, when you want to know the rigging, he puts it all together in an easy to follow read with good photo's and very good tips and pointers. Again, the detail is what I appreciated even though I plan to apply Tim's pointers to Fly fishing equipment. The book is spin fishing based, but can easily be crossed referenced to fly fishing. I will keep this book as my basic ""go to"" guide for a long time."
2,"Not as good as previous book, which is much better","This book is somewhat of a repeat of his previous book, but without as much details. It does repeat the same information over and over. Yes people need to hear the information over and over to sometimes comprehend the information but it is to the point of just filling pages. Summary: Save you time and money and get a copy of his first book. This one appears to be an attempt to develop more financial income, based on his name/reputation, without including any additional, useful information, as compared to Retriever Training for the Duck Hunter, which I have used to train several dogs and consider it the best there is!"
4,Retriever Training,"extremely thorough. very clear and concise information that should be read by anyone training a labrador retriever, whether for hunting or for basic obedience training"
3,The ultimate key to success ... not in my opinion,"This book has a number of interesting sequences that can be really difficult to master without proper training in tango argentino. Proper training, imho, is studying with the master teachers from Buenos Aires, proven as great educators around the world. Assuming one has such solid foundation, and now is attempting to master the sequences offered by the author of this book, then it may be beneficial to some dancers. But to call this book an ultimate key to success in tango is pretentious at the very least."
2,I agree with the others...lacks substance,"I read all the feedback everyone had given it and I was kind of fired up to get the book. I was a little disappointed when I finished it. There are nuggets of wisdom in this book and good things, no doubt about it. The ""everything you need to know to boost your score"" like the front cover touts couldn't have been more than 40 pages of a 200+ page book. It lacked substance. I think they could have spent less time defending their survey and defining EQ, and more time on more how-to's and tips."
1,Only Watch If You're Looking For A Good Laugh...,"Unless you're a toddler that scares REALLY easily, this is pathetic. The acting, especially in ""Bride of the Living Dummy,"" is terrible and annoying. An embarrassment to the usually great Goosebumps series."
2,Using What You Got,"Tiara is a self-centered brat who thinks that the world revolves around her. A New York inner city housing project serves as the background for this less than pleasing story that focuses on Tiara, the ultimate BAP. Tiara's sister, Jo-Jo, father, Reggie and Aunt Charley also play intergral roles in Tiara's life as she muddles her way through, making the absolute wrong choices, which ultimately come back to bite her in the behind. This offering is certainly better than the last Quinones-Miller book that I read, I'm Telling; however, there's nothing here that is worthy of recommending to others. 2.5 stars."
5,Belongs in Your Backpack,"There is a percpetion out there that BC consists of Vancouver, Victoria and some other bits. This is the book about the ""other bits.""I took a copy with me on a recent road trip from Prince Rupert to Vancouver, and it more than paid me back with useful information (not the least of which was the names of towns; apparently BC Highways doesn't believe in posting signs telling you where you are). Lots of history, which is always great, besides the usual road info. Take it, 'cause without it, you'll soon be on that unique BC mountain highway feature, the Runaway Lane!"
5,Classic Rock From Funkadelic!!,"From start to finish this album grew on me. From ""Commin' Round The Mountain"" let's you draw your own conclusions--be it Eddie Hazel or Mike Hampton, or Gary Shider, this is ""Guitar Player's Album"". Most excellent work. The ""newer"" version of ""Cosmic Slop"" is just as funky but a heavier rock feel. My hats off to Michael ""Kidd Funkadelic"" Hampton! he is a real prodigy--He ain't Eddie Hazel but he's a Funkadelic through and through! you cannot take that from ""Kidd"" (now you know where Prince got his name Kid from in Purple Rain--he ain't no Eddie Hazel either but he's good). ""You Scared The Love Out Of Me"" is done in true Funkadelic form tight music explicit lyrics and a wild imagination may even get your girl goin'! Very good piece of work guys--way to stick it to Westbound--Great start on warner Brothers..."
5,You'll Never Hear the Like of It Again,"The album that got me into Irish and folk many years ago deserves to be encrusted in gold and hung in Times Square.Poetic, mythical, anarchic. It catches the Pogues mid-way between Irish punk and World Indie. What a place to catch them. Brilliant."
5,Poguetry in motion,"It's hard to judge between the first three albums the Pogues released as they are all sublime in their own way but this, their slickest and most studio produced album, is a stunner.Every track a winner and the legendary and sorely missed Kirsty McColl duets with Shane MacGowan on the haunting and jaggedly truthful love story ""Fairytale of New York.""Shane Macgowan again shows he is adept at both the hard-driving irish rants and also the heart-breaking ballads like ""Broad Majestic Shannon"" and ""Lullaby of London."""
1,Astounding,"I am somewhat ambivalent about my rating - as an example of truly bad film, it is worthy of many, many stars. While there are still some vestiges of the original story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, it is a preposterous mish-mash of every medieval movie cliche imaginable. Dreadful dialogue, atrocious acting, and a confusing, if not schizophrenic story line. Watch it only if drunk, high, or with friends who enjoy the worst in film. A poorly realized and self-consciously serious version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail."
2,Adequate entertainment,"The only real draw here is Sean Connery, but he's on screen relatively little, and not in his greatest role. Most of the time, it's a badly-bewigged Gawain running around in white tights.It's adequate entertainment, if there's nothing else to watch. And if you like King Arthur and his cohort. And if ... well, you might like it. Or not.//wiredweird"
1,"0 STARS: Well, well, well, what have we here?????",".....TRASH!! That's what we got here with the laughable yet supposedly scary movie called ""Leprechaun""...PURE TRASH and PURE NONSENSE! I don't know people, call me crazy, call me unimaginative or call me an A-hole, but a movie about a murderous Leprechaun looking for his gold just doesn't strike me as horror cinema at its finest or even horror cinema period for that matter...maybe it's a joke or a silly attempt at trying to create a ""dork"" of a movie, but that's about all that I will give this trash because it is not a horror movie. In fact and quite frankly, this movie sucks and is a disgrace to the horror genre."
5,Leprechaun,"I thout this was an awesome show. I wish I could have it. I like the Leprechaun. He is scary, but that's ok I like scary movies. Leprechaun is the best show on the whole planet."
3,Not What You Expected....,"This movie is all right. It's kind of silly, and stupid. It's not really a horror movie, you can say. So don't expect it to be scary. But, there was some scary parts. Like when they couldn't find the Leprechaun in the yard. Don't expect it to be fabulos. But I gave it some credit. And it's a little bit scary. But, it's really not a horror movie."
2,LEPRECHAUN review!,"Who doesn't love a killer leprechaun looking for his pot of gold? Well, besides perhaps any self-respecting movie critic. Well, he's small, green, and he's looking for his pot of gold (seriously) and a poor group of kids is in his way including a pre-Friends Jennifer Aniston who I'm sure wishes this movie would dissapear forever.While this could be one of the dumbest movie ideas ever conceived (aside from any of its four sequels), it still makes for some stupid laughs."
5,Leprechaun Movie,I was very pleased with the condition of the movie and the very fast shipping. Thank You!
2,I don't get it,"I'm amazed at the great reviews - I really don't understand it. The product works for me while it's in my mouth; but eventually I can't help but swallow and soon it's gone. I may feel better for a couple of minutes as there is still residual product in my mouth but eventually, my dry mouth is totally back and I need more. What good is that? I can't be doing that all day; it's a little difficult to carry on a conversation. That's not a fix. The manufacturers claim it lasts up to 8 hours??! I'm trying to think how it might work in the people who claim it lasts that long for them. Does it cause some transformation in the salivary gland cells? My dry mouth is medication caused and it makes my life misery. I wish there was a product out there that worked. I'd be happy if it lasted half an hour."
5,A good product,"Unfortunately I have to deal with an extremely dry mouth during sleep time, apparently caused by many of my medications. Oral Balance does a good job of keeping my mouth moist over a period of several hours."
2,dry mouth treatment,"Unexpectedly, the gel is less effective than the liquid moisturizing spray. So, I don't use it much. It's far too expensive for what it does."
4,Not too bad tasting,"This product is great for Sjogren's sufferers with severe dry mouth. It is not the best tasting but it is better than the competition, and keeps your mouth moist. I will say that it is not very long lasting though, as I tend to swallow most of it within 15-30 minutes."
1,did not prevent dry mouth after sleeping,I bought this to see if it would help with the terrible dry taste caused by open mouth breathing after sleeping; it did not help at all.
1,Still waiting...,I purchased this product over a month ago and are still yet to recive it. This was a birthday present that will be given extremely late. Disappointed.
3,Good 400 Level Acoustics Book,"Used this book in EM/ME451 - Acoustics. Good introductory book - covers all the basic concepts. Good Lab section in the Appendix to get you started with hands on applications. I have used it as a reference many times since taking the class. Reference and citations are great - if it's not in the book, it will point you in the right direction. I did notice a few occurances of inconsistent nomenclature and a mangled table, but nothing too serious."
5,this is the best game in existence,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**! The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done, the combat system is well thought out, and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII. The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics, but when everything else is so amazing, WHO GIVES A F***? The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation, but as they get closer to bringing it down, they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet, but amke him an all powerful being. Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
4,A New Direction for Final Fantasy...,"Being a diehard Final Fantasy fan, I just had to get this game. While I enjoyed it for the most part, I was disappointed by the ""feel"" of the game for lack of a better term. It was not fantasy, it was more science fiction, and I really could have done without the awkward-looking polygon characters. But the music is fantastic, the storyline is moderately interesting, and I think it just depends on what kind of gamer you are as to how much you like it. Most newer gamers really love it, so if you are hesitant rent before you buy. (They finally listened to us old-school gamers and did us right with Final Fantasy IX, though! Marvelous!!)"
3,Okay,"It is okay, the first disc is a bit scratched and it freezes. It keeps freezing in one point and I can't pass that part where it keeps freezing. I do not know why it keeps doing that. It may be because I am playing the game on a playstation 2."
5,BEST GAME/RPG EVER MADE,"I bought this game back when ps1 was the new system. I had never played an RPG before and FF7 was recommended to me by a friend. First night playing I out in 5 hours, I was floored, to say the least. Everything about the game was great, the battle system, story, length, difficulty, I love the materia system and overall I have not one bad thing to say about this amazing game. There is nothing else like it (I've looked). No other final fantasy even comes close, and I've played and beat every single one. In my opinion, to date, this is the single greatest game ever made and a must have for any RPG fan. I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE the people who gave this game 1 star. Such people are fools and not true gamers in any way. Buy the game, you won't regret it!"
1,a big lump of coal,"i remember when i got this game in my x-mas stocking last year. i felt so bad. i was good all year and santa gave me this lame game. i remembered i cried all xmas day and like for 3 weeks afterwards. how could santa give me such a bad game???? final fantasy 7 is the worst game ever made. the grafix looks really bad, sorta like big slices of oranges with eyes. cloud, the main hero, has a sword that looks like a pencil, even has an eraser on it tooo, how lame!!! i wrote to santa this year and he promised me not to give me and final fantasy 7 stuff this year, and i was happy. alot of people hate this game cuz to beat it you have to pay[...] to get the code to unlock the 4th disk. i know u only get 3 disks, but to really beat it you have to buy the fourth one. my dad bought it for me and it sucked. basically in the fourth disk, you have to try to chop a mog into the shape of a catterpillar. i wish santa would have given me a big lump of coal instead. :("
5,Of all FF games the 7th one rules,"To the person who is reading this, I HIGHLY recommend you get this. First of all it's fun for all types of video game players! Even I who was first O.K at RPG navigated easily and had a blast and it taught me how to be great at RPGs. Second the story line is magnificent. When you play this game you will be coming back for more and more because you want to find out what happens to Cloud (the main character) and the rest. Another great part is the graphics. Although the walking graphics are bad the battle and movie graphics are outstanding. The price is a good thing too! Having one of the best games which contains three CD (it's long in a good way). So buy this now because if you don't you will be missing out on a lot of fun!Sincerely, a person who wants you to have fun"
1,very overrated,"I wish this game was funner, but the story was sooo boring and the graphics so outdated, that it really was a chore to finish this game. the ending was a rip off, seriously, i played like 50 hours and this ending just sucked!!! OVERRATED!"
1,uh.......,"well, this game is sorta boring. and the graphics are bad. I liked final fantasy 9 the best but this game is really bad. sometimes they say things that dont make sense. and theres a lot of spelling errors in the game too. ive seen better graphics on N64 games. after finishing my game, i dontated it to the local Salvation Army store, thats how bad it is."
1,Game is no fun at all,"Sorry, i from japan. so please listen me. First i take pants of for me to talk, ok? no pants off, so i say this game is very so bad. that is all."
2,"Didn't live up to the hype, or to Square's normal standards.","After games like Final Fantasy 6 (or 3 in America) and Secret of Mana, I've come to expect a lot more from Square than what was delivered. Oh, sure, it *looked* cool, but I was left feeling that's all it did -- the storyline was rather weak, and the characterization was substandard. By the time I made it to the second disc, it was dragging so bad that I quit for a while -- I eventually dredged through the third disc, which was just sheer boredom, to reach an extended but disappointing ending. I play a game to get lost in the plot, and found it lacking here. Square's Final Fantasy: Tactics (see my review there) provided all of this, and more, so it's not like they've lost their touch; FF7 just seemed either rushed, or as if they were simply aiming to sell games rather than leave their players with a good feeling afterwards."
1,this game screwed my final fantasy,"i hate this game, and i hated it when it came out. i think final fantasy 9 is a better rendition of this game. i still dont get why people like this trash of a game. so yucky and icky! EWWW!!"
1,Worst game ever,"Hands down this is the worst RPG I have EVER played. If only .. gave the option to give it no stars... I have almost every RPG out there (50+) and this one is by far the worst. The storyline was dumb and uninspired, the characters were laughable (and not in a good way), and the main boss could be killed with one hit. I like RPG's where I can connect with the characters and a fun story line. This had neither. The story line was really what turned me off of this game, trust me, it's not that I did not understand the story line cuz I did, it's just that the storyline was bad and predictible. Yes I said predictible. I saw every event comming. The characters could of been the saving grace but no...they fell miles short as well. To top it all off...I won't give away the ending but I will tell you it was the worst ending I have ever seen. My best friend that LOVES the game, for so odd reason, even hated the ending. ..."
1,Your joking...,"Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man, are you guys even trying anymore? I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh, you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics, horrible gameplay, sucky battle system, hard to understand, VERY difficult to get into it, too confusing, dumbxxx characters like cloud, hes the worst.(except sephiroth), sometimes too long of cutscenes, boring cutscenes, you can barely see their eyes & mouth, etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.I hate this game."
5,:),"best characters and storyline iv ever played....plot twists..great character development..this game does everything right.. Cloud:the main character is a bad ass, manley man..despite the fatc it probaly takes him 3 hours in the morning to do his hair..but hes cool none the less..barret: a black guy who is also manley and has a really bad temper...tifa:huge boobies, wears short shorts and is probaly really pretty if the graphics were better..oh and shes nice and obviously wants to get into clouds pants...aeris: a good girl who probaly shouldnt stand under balconys or anything somebody can jump on top of her... cid: foulmouth badass...this game has a lot of bad asses...red XIII: plays the role of the wise old man...though hes not a man and techinically in his years hes onky a teenagerGET THIS GAME...ull love it...if u like rpgs ull love this game and follow it like a religion"
2,IMPORTANT REVIEW!,"I am a Nintendo carrie-over; I loved the original Zelda. This game IS Zelda, with a face lift. In other words, I'm not impressed. With the technological advances since the original Nintendo, they made this game look prettier (sort of - the polygons are obnoxious as heck). Only thing they forgot was to make it fun. Boring gameplay. The fight sequences are the worst. You just push a button over and over until your character gets good and ready to fight. Woopie. If you're in the mood to watch a movie, buy this game. Otherwise, it's just a waste of your time. Go buy Metal Gear Solid - that's a nice blend of gameplay and cinematics."
5,Epic in every sense of the word!,"No RPG has come close to having the kind of stories and atmosphere that the Final Fantasy series has. But no Final Fantasy game has come close to the timeless masterpiece of Final Fantasy VII. The characters are superb! I will never forget Cloud, Aeris, Tifa, Barrett, Cid (Highwind) and the others. The story is incredible and the music is classic! Sure, the sound and graphics don't measure up to PS2, Xbox or Gamecube. But this game is above all that. Video games have never left as deep an impression on me like this one has. This is THE defining title in the Final Fantasy series."
5,An RPG worth being a PLaystation's Greatest Hits,"This game is by far one of the best RPG's playstation has ever seen. While it is not as realistic as Final Fantasy 8, It has a better and more intersting storyline. You really start to love the characters and you get alot more side missions to do. Final Fantasy 7 really allows you to get into the characters while in FF8 you just meet them but get little history. I've played this game several times over and while it is difficult at times, it is good for a first time RPG player and a good challenge for experts. Also the fights call for you to use a wide variety of tactics. In FF7 you really do depend on enemy's weaknesses to certain attacks, but in FF8 very little is really effected by this part of the game. You'll also find a good musical score that will stick in your mind and as a side feature, you get 2 new bosses not found in the Japanese Version. This games is defenately awsome."
5,Good Lord Best Game Ever!,"This is by far the greatest game in the Final Fantasy series and perhaps the greatest game of all time. This game definitely had the best story line of any game i've played and the character are quite endearing. The replay value on this great RPG and the secrets are extremely high. There are many things you can do after you've beaten the game once and decide to play it again. This game completely blows FFVIII away, which I saw as a complete letdown. Anyways, this game is a great price on Amazon and will be well worth the 60 hours it takes you to beat the entire game."
1,i thought it was good????,"I REALLY gave this game a chance, but it failed to live up to all the talk i heard. I finished it and couldnt help but feel bored. the ending (is)so bad, from beginning to end, i felt like it was like playing a really boring game. I like final fantasy 8 and 10 better."
1,Really bad graphics,"People say this game is good, but its not, the graphics really stink as does the story,(if u can call it a story). I do agree that this game is very over rated."
1,greatest hit? should be greatest sh_t.,"oh just in case you didnt realize, that ""_"" is an ""i"". but this game is very overratedly overhyped. yeah, i know, bad english, but u know what?......this is a bad game., bad as in lame."
5,Wow...,"This game is truly amazing. Its the best game on the computer and Play Station, and the second best game ever created. First off, I like the comment on the amazing storyline in this. If you pay attention, you will be captavated. The charactors are memorble and you will get drawn in to their problems and have emese problems getting to sleep at night because you want to know what happens next. The gameplay is easy to catch on to and yet challenging latter in the game. The music is just plain awsome. I loved it so much ( and most people who liked it as much as me) got the soundtrack. So to summerize, just buy it. And if you do not have a playstation, buy it for the PC. Enjoy, I know that I will."
4,FF7 Is a really great game!,"I've seen good final fantasy games, but FF7 rules! The only thing that I give a thumbs down is that sometimes the storyline gets hard to understand. I'm still working on the game, but so far it's been really cool. I'd have to say that 8 is better though. I haven't beaten any of my final fantasy games yet, and this one's a real challenge. The characters are Cloud, Barret, Tifa, Red XII( later known as Nanaki), Cid, Yuffie, Vincent, and, my personal favorite, Aeris. She dies permanently, though. You start out in the floating high-tech city of Midgar, and from there you go to towns like Kalm, Resort places like Costa Del Sol, and find out things about the Ancients, an ancient race of which Aeris is the sole survivor. This game is really awesome!"
1,Not like the others,"I have to admit, i like the newer final fantasies better, this one has very bad graphics and the story is for teens, not really a final fantasy for adults. The story is very ""comical"" not real or heartening like in Final Fantasy 8 and 10. The characters are Polygon-like graphics which really bother me cuz they not only look bad but move badly too. It was a nice try for Square, but it just didnt cut it."
1,I HATE FINAL FANTASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dumb! It's a bunch of spiky haired teenagers running around trying to fight and idiot named Sephiroth and a stupid electricity company. Sephiroth is stupid because he has WHITE HAIR! No I really mean it! WHITE HAIR! It does not deserve to be called a video game, and I hate anyone who likes it. The focus on the story is so much that the gameplay sucks. The turn based fighting is the absolute opposite of strategic. I HATE THIS **** GAME!Well, the main reason I hate this game is that they focus WAAAYYYYY to much on the story. They thought about gameplay last."
1,Major Disapointment,"Like the title says, this game is a major disapointment. Don't get me wrong, gameplay is great and it's easy to pickup and go. Lot's of monsters and great characters but one thing is standing in the way of it being a five star winner. This is about to be a spoiler so don't read any further if you care.Aries dies in the middle of the game and from that point on, everything leads you to believe that you could bring her back to life at some point in the game but this isn't true, actually, it's half true, you can bring her back with a game shark, the reason being is that they had planned from the beginning to allow her to be brought back but funding/time ran short and they pushed the game out the door unfinished. This is a major disapointment to me and as soon as I found out you couldn't bring her back it burned me out to the point that I quit playing the game..."
1,STOP IT!!,"THIS GAME IS SO COOL, SO STOP GIVING IT 1 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FINAL FANTASY VII ROCKSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!"
1,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DONT BELIVE THE FOLKS HERE THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER SO IM GIVING IT A QUABILLIONTRILLION STARS FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER. THIS GAME SAVED MY LIFE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. I DRESS UP LIKE CLOUD ALL THE TIME SO ILOOK SO COOL
4,GOOD?! COMPARED TO WHAT?,"I hate this game. It is so dumb. Have any of you ever played any Zelda games?!? It is so much better then this stupid FF game. When you fight in this game you do ""Press X to launch an attack,"" ""Now it's the enemy's turn to fight."" In Zelda, it's actually instant action fighting! Think about it? Have you ever been in a fight with someone where you stand 50 feet away from them, attack, and then wait for them to attack? I didn't think so. You people who have Playstations think that it's cool and Nintendo systems are kiddie. Well, this game is as stupid and kiddie as any Pokemon game - they're both boring and unrealistic. So...GET ZELDA NOT FF!!"
5,Final Fantasy GURU,"This was the last game I actually committed myself to as I don't have the time to play games like this anymore. But anyways, this was the best game that I ever had the chance to get totally involved with. I have played FF from the days of regular Nintendo and will forever appreciate the entertainment that I got from playing it. Go SquareSoft! I do believe that was who released it."
5,one of the best,"True this game may not have the best graphics by today's standards but when the game was released it had far superior graphics than any game to date. That having been said, the gameplay and story alone make this a remarkable game. It has the best storyline of any of the ff games imo and the use of materia, as well as all the side quests available have made this one of the most fun games i have ever played."
5,Superb!,"This is arguably the best FF game ever. The plot is real mysterious and intense. It came out in 1997, and people are STILL speculating who the main bad guy is! The characters develop well, and the CGs are pretty good as well."
1,my sandwich,"Final Fantasy 7 could possibly be the lamest final fantasy game ever created. I personally love Final Fantasy 9. Final fantasy 7 is too ""kiddy"" and ""childish"", not really for the teen and adult gamer. cloud is annoying too. he shrugs way too much in the game, as if he gots back spasms or something."
3,good.....,"I think all the animorphs books were good until after this one.I think #1Animorphs was one of my favorite books I've read.But after #13 it's the same thing over and over.The books went down hill from there.All it's about anymore is ""oh no what should we do about this mission?!""Now these books suck."
5,It was the best of the Animorphs series to date.,"I loved the way Ms.Applegate wrote for what it was like for Tobias to change back to a human.Even though not fully,at least something is better than nothing. The quality of Applegate's wrting seems to be getting better with each book. I have read each of the books in her series and I can say in all honesty that I believe the Animorphs will be one of the most popular series ever done. I am a twenty seven year old college student and I know I should feel funny about reading and writing about the Animorphs. But to tell the truth I don't, because Applegate's writing is so good that she does the one thing any writer should do,that is to take the reader out of their life and tempoarly let them into a fictional world where anything can happen.And in this case does happen. Keep up the good work Ms. Applegate. And 'til Visser Three wins the war, LONG LIVE THE ANIMORPHS."
5,Animorphs RULE! ( Tobias really does too.),Although I have not read this book yet I know it has to be good because its Animorphs & because its supposed to be about Tobias. Ahh Tobias is the Best Animorph! He's soooo COOL and man is he CUTE! Oh Yeah!
5,Sansa Battery,"The battery arruved in time, was exactly what I ordered and worked flawlessly in the unit. I would buy from this seller again."
5,Kathy Bates does an excellent job,"Great quality, and well read audio book. The Silence of the Lambs story is perhaps the best thriller/horror story out there."
5,GO FOR THE BOOK NOT THE MOVIE,"I remember the movie from way back, and this book by Thomas Harris convinced me yet again (As if I ever doubted it) that the written word is far more entertaining and enjoyable than the big screen.The book took me in straight away and the evil face of Hannibal Lector portrayed by Hopkins in the movie, climbed into bed with me each night, as I flicked off the light switch.A compelling, yet at times disturbing read, that makes it hard to put the book down. If you enjoyed the movie, the book is an absolute must!"
5,A timeless classic,"This is UNDOUBTEDLY the BEST horror/suspense book I have ever read!It's even better than the movie and when I started reading it, I just COULDN'T put it down!"
5,Astonishing!,"I can't say anything that's not already been said about this novel. For years, I refused to read ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" because I love the movie. I've since been kicking myself, because the novel is slightly better. Although, I love the movie, this novel lets you truly step inside the story. It's chilling, it's thought-provoking---it's just plain BRILLIANT!!!!!!!"
4,A Wonderful Psychological Thriller,"Hannibal Lecter is the guy you love to hate. He's a brilliant, sophisticated person who would probably be quite nice socially except for that whole cannibalism thing. Clarice Starling is a promising young FBI agent in training. She's sent to see Hannibal Lecter in an attempt to get him to answer a questionaire for the Forensics department. Lecter reveals some information to Starling, which leads her discover more information regarding past and current crimes. This book is intruiging. The way Harris gets into the mind of a serial killer is wonderful. I almost felt sorry for the guy, once in s a while. Almost. This book was definitely a page turner."
4,Riveting,"The stunning new WWII novel ""The Triumph and the Glory"" is the only book I've read lately that was as emotionally powerful as ""The Silence of the Lambs"". This book, which is far better than Hannibal, is a terrifying account of evil unleashed. It is a monumental achievement, a soul-searing look at the darkest recesses of the human soul."
2,No Depth Whatsoever,"I can't say that I had high expectations for this book, which turned out to be a good thing. I felt like I was reading an episode of Law & Order. There was zero in the way of character development. Sure, I knew what school the protagonist was going to and basic information about her room mate and a flashback here and there to her childhood. But overall, I didn't really get to know or care about the characters.I kept waiting for it to get scary but it really didn't do it for me. The tension wasn't built quite well enough for me, nor was the writing particularly interesting. In fact, I noted that there were 3 pages in a row where every single paragraph started with, ""Starling..."" (which is the main character's name). ""Starling went to the bank.."" ""Starling thought long and hard, "" Starling woke up and then walked around for awhile.""Everyone was either good or bad, there was just basically no depth at all.Overall, I'm not impressed."
5,The BEST book I've read,"This is the first and best book I've read. My dad suggested this book so i read it. I later read all of the Thomas Harris books. The Silence of the Lambs was the best of the Hannibal series and I highly reccomend this book to all readers. If you saw the movie and liked it, you will for sure enjoy this book. The parts with Hannibal are by far the best parts of the book. His escape is the best part of the book, better than the ending. You will love reading this book"
3,"Capable, well-crafted thriller rises a half-step above the genre","The book would never receive the accolades that the movie did, because it doesn't rise head and shoulders above the pack in terms of quality.While the movie was seen as a genre-topping masterpiece, the book is merely very good.The book, like the movie, hinges on the powerful character of Hannibal Lecter, a man whose viciousness is almost overshadowed by his preternatural genius. Lecter is what makes the book special, and Harris deserves plenty of credit for coming up with a twist on the ""evil genius"" that is both fresh and iconic.I would recommend that you read the Lecter books in sequence, although you might want to forgo the closing entry, ""Hannibal."""
2,"Many good ""how to's"", BUT","David Hampshire gave much helpful guidance regarding the rules, regulations and bureaucracy in France (although ""Frommer's"" and ""Lonely Planet"" books do as well). However, his clear dislike for most things French (especially the people) made the book read more like a prejudiced, bigoted, diatribe. A bit of fun-poking would have certainly been acceptable and lightened a bare facts book, but Mr. Hampshire went on for, literally, pages and at every opportunity to criticize and ridicule. One wonders, if he were corect in his assessments, how a country so filled with stupid, unwashed, crude and lazy people could possibly be responsible for the creation and ongoing care of some of the world's greatest works of artistic expression. Shame on you Mr. Hampshire. Perhaps in your next revision, you'll omit the vitriolic rhetoric. It will be a much better book."
3,Well Made But Has Issues,"This mobile base is well made and solid, but I can't give it more than 3 stars.My biggest issue with it may not actually be the fault of the base. It's that the bandsaw rocks a bit. This could be the cabinet or the mobile base, but since they're supposed to be manufactured to work together, it's not a forgivable sin. Wedging shims in the corners has pretty much solved the problem, but I don't think I should have to do that with a premier tool like this.The other issue I have is with the two non-swivel wheel locks. Simply a threaded bolt (with a knob) that contacts the wheels to lock them. It works fine but to me seems like cheesey engineering.Other than that, the base does what it's designed to do.Nonetheless, maybe it's just me, but I expected more from this product."
4,First one did not work. Second one did.,"My phone arrived and the ear piece did not work. I called and the phone rang, I dialed out and it went through but the ear piece was dead. Sent it back for a replacement. It felt like a quality item, hefty and cool looking. It does not look cheap at all. I hope the replacement works.EDIT: Ya gotta love Amazon. I notified them my phone did not work and wanted a replacement. The replacement was shipped the following day, even before I had the defective phone repacked. It arrived today and works fine.This is a nice addition to my office and an incentive to set a period motif. Love it."
3,Loved the idea but it had too much static in the background,"It had the look and feel of the old real thing but the sound was too inconsistent to keep it. About half the calls had so much static in the background that listeners couldn't hear us. Too bad because we really liked it otherwise, but returned it for a refund."
1,Promulgates a bad image of gays,"A teenager is seduced into gay sex by an older ""sophisticated"" man. Then he is encouraged to participate in drugs and orgies. An innocent gay is raped and commits sucide because he is gay. Every conceivable negative stereotype of gays and gay life finds its way into this novel. It is propaganda for the religious right, confirming their worst fears. There is nothing here of tenderness, of love, of reality. And this review will not be printed because Amazon (who wants to sell books) will not print a negartive review."
3,"FRED ZINNEMANN, OPUS 17","The Nun's Story lost 8 to 0 against William Wyler's Ben Hur during the 1959 Academy awards ceremony. No problemo, God was the winner after all. Curious how In both films, we also have a long scene with lepers but, in the Nun's Story, our Lord didn't make a miracle and allowed a devoted doctor to catch the disease. That's the whole difference between a blockbuster doomed to meet the larger possible audience and a film directed by an auteur (I didn't say that William Wyler wasn't an auteur). Recommended."
3,"The good nun with bad ""habits""",A well done movie with Audrey Hepburn. The movie is better than you might think.
4,Very Good,"This book helped me a lot on the AP US exam. THe information review is about 200 pages long, so it it very concise and most important of all, you can do the entire review within a week easily. My only complaints are the dated material regarding grading. The DBQ used to be graded on a 15 point scale, but now it is graded on a 9 point scale (The book says it is worth 15). Also, the practice tests are so-so. They are somewhat different than the real test and don't buy this book only because it has 6 tests while others have 2 or 3 (there is NO way you can do all of the tests unless you stay home all day and study. Still the practice tests do help a bit. I recommend this book to anyone. Cracking the AP US I'm sure is fine, but they spend too much time mocking the test and the College Board, and when there's only a few days until the big test we all hate the College Board enough, we don't need to be reminded."
4,Uptempo Blues-Based Christmas Songs,"An enjoyable collection of blues-based Christmas tunes, done by one of the premier ""big band"" jump blues acts playing today. For those that really enjoy this, want more, and are not on Santa's ""naughty"" list, try adding ""Santa Claus, Do You Ever Get The Blues"" by the band, from a later Alligator label sampler of blues Christmas tunes, and ""Please Come Home For Christmas,"" a blue-based version by Pat Benatar (sans eighties-style trappings), but which features, uncredited, Roomful of Blues (it can be found on The Edge of Christmas, Pat's True Love CD, and other places). (If you do that, I suggest adding them at the end, following one of the slow songs, such as ""I Want You With Me Christmas,"" and moving a more uptempo song to follow, such as ""I Want To Spend Christmas With You,"" for programming purposes.)"
1,Awful,"The good thing first: the snap clips are nice for quick attachment and removal of the strap.Now the bad. Firstly, this strap will be too long, even at its shortest adjustment, for many players, especially for those on the smaller side such as I. Shortening it by cutting it is not an option because of the one good thing about it above; but the worst thing about this strap is that the shoulder pad is slippery, providing no stabilizing support. I can't get my banjo to sit still with this strap, even when I'm sitting down with it. I know I could add something on my own to fix this, but why should I have to?Bad deal, in my opinion."
5,Great Strap,"Very comfortable strap, using it on my new banjo. I really like the clips, they make it very easy to put the strap on and take it off. If you are like me and looking for a comfortable, convenient and most importantly affordable strap, you've found it! I highly recommend the Neotech Super Banjo Strap."
2,pleased,"I was fortunate enough to have met Mr. Bluth after a presentation he made at my school. I was then compelled to buy his book. The art of Anastasia I must admit was a bit of a disappointment. The movie is grand and is filled with fantastic visuals, the book very poorly reflects that. The book primarily shows pictures we already seen in the film. Unlike other making of books, were not shown much of the animation proses. The book is worth the low price I paid and will be a nice fit for my collection."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"What a joke this ""documentary"" is. Do not waste your time; I consider the $4.99 I spent on the rental to be a complete waste of money. The topic is interesting to be sure; a studied look at it could be fascinating, but this treatment is a disgrace.The ""evidence"" is all so absurd. The shadowy conversations and trumped up imminent danger is laughable. The maze weaved together - on significant issues - is constructed from bizarre measurements and almost comical findings.Again, the subject matter is of great interest to many people, but bogus treatments of it like this one will do nothing to advance the legitimacy of any such bloodline claims; don't waste your time."
2,"Initials of Priests who found the ""Clues"" in France says it all (B.S)","I thought that the basis of the movie was interesting, and personally think that Jesus and Mary Magdeline could have been married, but found parts of the movie a little too convenient and after reading that ""Ben"" made up the whole tomb thing I was not shocked. While watching it I thought that it was interesting that the guy who supposedly found all these parchments and baubles at Rennes le Chateaus name was Bérenger Saunière, because I kept on thinking that Ben finding all these bottles and clues Sauniere ""left"" was a bunch of B.S."
4,Tough listen but well worth the time to get to know it,"I found it in some ways like Eels in that its not gonna knock you out first time round. However, given time it really grows on you and some of the tunes , such as 'valley' , leave you wishing for more and more. Kurt Liebert is a talent to watch."
5,great,I got this memory card and a canon camera to go with it. Nice fast delivery and everything came as said on the selling page. Thank you.
4,Kingston Memory Card,What's there to say about a memory card? It works; it was delivered in a timely manner; we are satified
4,"Big memory, good speed.",I am very happy with this product. It has a very large storage space. I have 1800 photos on it so far. The speed was good too. The only draw back I found was that it was a bit slow when I turned on the flash. They are such a good deal I can just buy a new one when I use up this one.
4,Quite Excellent,"Ever wonder what kind of person takes such an interest in every form of flora or fauna there is? One who is hyperobservant, apparently. And when Gerald Durrell turns that eye on the eccentric characters in his family and around him on the island of Corfu, you'll absolutely love reading his words."
5,My Family and Other Animals,"Gerald Durrell, age 10, and his family take up residence on the Greek island of Corfu in the years between the world wars. Young Gerry carefully writes down all his observations of the worlds both natural and family, one minute collecting scorpions in matchboxes, the next cataloguing sister Margo's many affairs of the heart, and the next tooling around the island in his faithful boat, the Bootle Bumtrinket. There's a reason the Greek immigration official calls them ""a traveling circus.""Followed by Birds, Beasts and Relatives, The Garden of the Gods, and The Picnic and Suchlike Pandemoniom."
4,BUG BOY,"Gerald Durrell had a childhood most children only deam about. He had a crazy family, a shaggy dog, various flying pets, a donkey for his birthday and a most indulging mentor.Most of all, he had halcyon days on the Greek island of Corfu.This is the first of many Durrell books that have enchanted generations of young nature lovers. Most have grown older reading his adventures throughout the forests and savannahsSome have even made pilgrimages to his Jersey zoo to see for themselves the animals he collected.But most of all, Gerald Durrell brought magic and escape from boarding school solitude and like his brother, Lawrence, created a literary legacy for generations to come.Sadly, how many will discover his books? And how many of the creatures he wrote about will survive our lifetimes?Get the book. Get all the books.At least we can preserve the memories on our bookshelves."
5,Gerald Durell is wonderful!,"All of Gerald Durell's writings are terrific, but the ones about his family are truly laugh-out-loud wonderful! This is a book I have enjoyed over and over, and have given as a gift many times."
2,quality of book is poor,"I bought a new paperback and am very disappointed by the quality of the product. While the story is really good, I just wish the book was better made. Seriously, a used copy would have been much better!"
1,I haven't even received this item. How can I rate it?,"My glowing one-star review was based on the fact that I have nor received the item in question. Estimated delivery date was somewhere between Dec. 18, 2012 and Jan 4, 2013. It is now Jan 14. When/if I get this book, I will be glad to give it a fair review, if I am given a second chance."
4,Joe Estevez.... enough said?,"""Soultaker"" is a great MST3K episode for those fans who prefer the film being riffed to have at least a somewhat coherent plot. And I do use the word ""coherent"" loosely since the soul (no pun intended) of MST3K is a truly awful movie. This one is about as coherent as a movie about a group of teenagers on the run from an angel of death would ever get. Which maybe isn't saying much, but you don't have to expend a lot of effort trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Instead, you can focus on the commentary, which is really hilarious throughout, but definitely improves as the movie progresses -- so stick with it! This one is worth it.This episode is also worth watching for the surprise visitor Mike and the bots get during of the host segments. No episode I have seen will top the host segments from ""Time Chasers,"" but these are ones you do not want to miss."
5,Persuasions Christmas,"I have heard almost everything the Persuasions have recorded...To me , their best album is 'We Came to Play."" I have played that album thousands of times....it is one of the greatest albums ever recorded, in my opinion. So naturally I was curious to hear their Christmas album...All in all I think it is a 5 star album, it can be thrown in a random Christmas mix with other albums or songs...Or you could just play it on its own. Lawson's voice is not quite perfection, sounds like he had a cold or possibly just was too hard on his voice when they recorded this...but it still sounds great. The production quality is very high, and the harmonies are very good. If you like Acapella music...and you are looking for a Christmas Album, this should be on a short list of the best ones."
4,"Nice product, great transaction!","I like the leash, but am debating whether I want use a different one.With that said, my transaction with the seller was excellent!"
3,ours,sorry to say the damn thing broke the second time we used it on a minature schnawser this product is a priece of crapl well that is what u get for order stuff without being able to see it.
1,"Great idea, very poorly made","I've had 2 of these monopods in my possession now and neither one of them ever worked properly. The bottom segment either fails to lock or won't retract. Not after many uses mind you, we're talking right out of the box! The bottom line is that this is a very cheaply made product that would be over priced at half of what they charge for it. What good is ""special aeronautical grade aluminum alloy"" if the internal components are made up of plastic tinker toys?? This monopod is like a Ferrari with a Pinto engine. A beautiful worthless piece of junk."
1,Rubber foot problem,"I liked this monopod after the first use, even though it is heavy.Unfortunately I couldn't find a second chance to use, it as its notorious rubber foot got lost. After a quick search over the internet for a replacement, I found that this is big problem with this otherwise good monopod..Without rubber foot it is useless, how can you stabilize it over a spike?"
4,Simple to use,"Compaired these to a popular brand Reese that was similar, however I returned them to the store because the Amazon clip on mirrors looked better & worked well on our trip. The only negitive is to be carefuladjusting the stiff mirror surface."
5,Ed's Best Work,"Of all of Ed's recordings, this is the most emotional and melodic. I have Luna and Night Birds as well, but this one is the cd I keep going back to. If you don't play guitar, after hearing this, you'll want to! You absolutely will love it."
4,cool product,This is a very well designed and highly useful product. I gave it as a gift to one of my wine-loving cousins.
4,"Fun, smart, unusual","I'm surprised to see the disc offered on Amazon! A buddy turned me on to these guys about 20 years ago, since we both like complex and unusual music, but nothing too far afield from good old pop and rock.I agree with the idea that they're underrecognized, but that makes sense. This isn't your standard ranch stash. If you like bands like Group 87 or Bill Bruford's Earthworks, then this is right up your alley.Strong recommendation!"
2,"JFK??? You mean ""Dallas in Wonderland""","The movie ""JFK"" is an excellent example of what happens when non-historians attempt to write history: the fact get sacrificed for the entertainment. Oliver Stone is no dummy however. He knows that no one would pay to see a movie that revealed that Lee Harvey Oswald actually WAS the guilty person who shot and killed President Kennedy. Sadly, this movie runs fast and free with the historical facts. Virtually every ""mysterious"" detail Stone brings up has a very simple and logical explanation. Has Stone pricked the national conscience with this movie? Perhaps, but more importantly he has used his artistic liscence to put a twist (Oliver's Twist) on what really happened that tragic day in Dallas. Those who haven't read a great deal about the Kennedy assassination will swallow his conspiracy nonsense hook, line, and sinker. Those more familiar with the actual facts will roll their eyes and sigh that any educated person could believe such nonsense."
4,Apres Le Swindle,"Notorious as the mastermind behind the Sex Pistols, McLaren surprised everyone with an album (originally released in 1983) that blended African high-life rhythms, early East Coast hip-hop, latin beats, moody synthesizers (courtesy of Thomas ""she blinded me with science"" Dolby and Anne ""art of noise"" Dudley) and Tennessee-hilltopper fiddles (!) into a heady gumbo that may qualify as the first post-punk World Music album. Gleefully schizophrenic, this record is pure genius, pure fun, and a testament to McLaren's sense of style. A must-have in any collection, and a killer car-stereo selection."
1,EMINEM RIP-OFF,"my favorite rap song ever is ""without me"" by eminem and i was shocked when i heard ""buffalo gals"" by malcolm mclaren.the lyrics go ""two buffalo gals go round the outside, round the outside"" which rips off eminem's ""two trailer park girls go round the outside, round the outside"". not to mention there is a bunch of scratching and weird noises and it sounds very outdated.i suggest you pick up The Eminem Show and don't buy anything from Malcolm Mclaren."
5,We're on a world tour with Mr. Malcolm Mclaren...,"""We're on a world tour with Mr. Malcolm McLaren/we go each and every place including Spain""... so raps the Supreme Team on ""World Famous."" When I first heard these words at a house party at the University of South Carolina in 1983, I could only say WHOA! Then at the same party, the DJ played ""Buffalo Gals"" (also from this Album/CD), the kids went WILD and I dropped my jaws in disbelief! I HAD to run to the nearby record store. This was in fact one of tmy intros to African music, but it's very good as an example of excellent hip hop shortly before Run DMC saved the genre from dying out. This Album also helped in that first-aid effort. Still fun to listen to after all these years."
5,love her books,"We love Julia Donaldson's books. Her stories are fantastic, and her rhyming flows so smoothly. Very easy to read aloud to the kids. This story in particular is one of my favorites because of how poetically everything is described. We'll be collecting all of her books!"
5,Hardback book,This book was in great shape for the minimal cost. The only issue I had was the time it took to receive it - two weeks or so. Guess that isn't so bad - it just seemed like a long time in this fast paced world to which we have become accustomed.
5,Modern literature at its best.,"Brilliantly written. I'm not a fiction reader and don't like romance novels. However, I'm totally hooked on Rosamunde Pilcher now and have read three of her masterful books within the past two weeks. Coming Home is my favorite because of its epic nature and historical background. I didn't want the captivating story to end, despite sadness felt about the demise of a gentler, more civilized era."
5,A classic!,I got so involved with the characters I was sad when it was over. It has good character development and an interesting storyline. An all around enjoyable read. I would definietly read it again...and that's saying a lot for me.
3,not the shell seekers,It's pretty difficult to rate any of Pilcher's books above the Shell Seekers. ... and this one does NOT make it.
4,Challenging,It's a great toy to have. It's very tough and challenging tho which makes it even better. I hope I get to put it together one day because it'll take me for ever!
1,CD images are too low Rez,"Fantastic cartoons, but the CDs have such low resolution images, that they are unviewable. I bought this collection to see all of Saul Steinberg's cartoons, and I am unfortunately limited to what was printed."
5,Funny,"It was a gift to a friend...her thank you note reads ""I am really enjoying my New Yorker cartoon book. Granted, some of them are over my head. But others are laugh-out-loud funny."""
4,Great collection,"""The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker"" is a wonderful collection of consistently funny cartoons that, more times than not, make us laugh at our own short-sightedness and habits. My only complaint, and the only reason I didn't give this five stars, is that the resolution of the images on the included DVD-ROM is not that great. In some cases, it's a bit difficult to catch the ""sight gag"" in the illustration- unacceptable. Too bad- a little more care in this department would have made this a near-perfect volume."
2,A Great Disappointment,"When I finished this book with its depressing ending, I couldn't help but think that the sole purpose of this novel was to set up the scenario for Dailey's next Calder installment. As a reader, I felt used.Most people read romance novels because they enjoy seeing relationships develop and they like happy endings (something we frequently don't get in real life). This novel was devoid of both these elements.Forewarned is forearmed: The tale is interesting enough, because Dailey is an accomplished wordsmith, but the conclusion will not put a sigh on your lips or a smile on your face."
2,disappointed,"I have read all the ""Calder"" series books and was deeply disappointed with Janet Dailey's latest. The tragedy in the book ruined it for me. I felt that the plot was weak, especially with Tara, and that it was disjointed."
3,Too sad of an ending!!,"Most of the Calder stories (and I have read them all) have some sadness in the story but for the most part, end on an upbeat note. I was really depressed when I finished this book! I am, however, hoping there is another chapter of the Calder Family on the way. I would like to see this saga ending on a positive note....leaving us readers with a good feeling!"
3,"Oh, No!...","""This Calder Sky"" was the book that got me reading again years ago. I ordered it through a book club and read it while I was in the hospital. I have read the complete series and while this one started out alright, I really didn't get the feeling that any of this people loved and laughed. It was always that way with the other Calder series. They were people that stood out on the pages and long after the story ended, I thought about them. They connected with each other. I have read the Calder stories over and over. I will continue reading the older versions but this one just doesn't do it for me the way the others did. Perhaps if the sequels to this book stand alone and don't focus on this book as the mainstay, I MAY read others in this series.What can I say? ..."
5,"Where There's Smoke, There's Fire",He has a combination of styles that I like - energetic zydeco with blues and old r & b - and he still does the best rendition of Get Your Kicks on Route 66 ever
2,kindle version good for those with eyes of an eagle,The book is great. The only thing is that the images in kindle version of the book are so small it is impossible to see anything. And there is no way to enlarge them ! The same happens to tables -looks like they are poor quality photos of a printed book. Cannot enlarge them either. If I had a printed book I would rate it as five stars.
5,Good stuff,"I remember taking Wheat Germ Oil as a kid and I had the thickest hair, strong nails, and smooth skin. Now that I've destroyed my hair with relaxers and toxic hair colors, I've opted to go back to natural (out of necessity and choice) and require some aid to assist me on this journey. Wheat germ oil is one of them. Good supply of Vitamins A, D, and E. Also, natural oils such as these helps to keep internal plumbing in check, as well. I don't recall this brand having any filler oils such as soy/soya bean or the like. You really can't go wrong when doing nutritional stuff for yourself. So buy, use and enjoy! And you'll bear witness to all the good things Whet Germ oil has to offer, such as healthy hair, nails, skin and eyes."
5,BEAUTIFUL GUITAR,"There are likely to be around 80 billion guitar players at any given moment, but very few of them could put together a record this beautiful. Intimate, crystal clean playing--perhaps even meditative. Early morning, high noon, late in the evening--any time you put this album on--you'll be happy."
3,Hmmm,"So personally this is one of my least favorite Steven Seagal movies, maybe cause I think it reflects the worst in the character. But I guess that's the character of Gino. I've read interviews and watched interviews of Seagal Sensei's and he speaks about manners of peace and harmony. I am an Aikido student myself and when I watch this movie, I believe he goes against a lot of the philosophies that he gives when teaching. Yes, I know that this is not an Aikido film nor is the character Seagal sensei. However, there is a part of me that does wonder why Seagal Sensei would play a cop like Gino who in my opinion is a horrible, brutal cop. I like to think the whole movie is a twist of irony because there is no true ""Justice"" in this movie. lol"
5,"Akido woops up again, and again!! Ay yo **** nuts.",Segaul and his Akido has once again open some cans of woop-***. Easily one of the 5 best 'quotable movies' of all time.
1,Hard To Get Into,"A wealthy balloonist enlists Frank and Joe's help to protect him and a valuable life-size chess piece, the Ruby King, with which he has been entrusted. I didn't find this book very good; it was very hard to get into this book, the reader doesn't learn much about the mystery in the first few chapters. The mystery is not very interesting, there is little action and many of the chapter endings aren't exciting enough to make you want to read more. In my opinion, this is one of the five worst books of the series."
4,Great concept but not well executed,This toy combines two math tools into one and the child can use it in numerous ways. Concept is great. My one and only complaint is the paint on the tiles are already fading and rubbing off so I question the longevity of this product.
2,Kind of Tedious,"I usually like a book like this, but found this one very boring.There was no ""hotel"" until over half way through the book and there was no 'haunting' untilalmost 75% of the way through.Just bored me to tears.."
3,A Good Read for a Rainy Day,"If you don't have any other reading to do on a rainy day, I would recommend this book. It was a quick read. I did figure out the truth before Collins actually revealed it, but that sometimes happens. Do I think the hotel is haunted? Was it a true ghost story? Not really. It's more murder mystery than ghostly."
3,Is Room 14 haunted?,"I have very much enjoyed the works of Wilkie Collins that I have read, so happily downloaded the free Kindle version of The Haunted Hotel.Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the main female and male characters. The main female is just too perfect and everyone loves her. Bleah.However, I think the Countess redeems the story. As she describes herself, a woman of good and evil (i.e., an actual character). Watching her mental state as the story evolves is quite interesting, and how she reveals what happened in Venice is certainly one of the more unusual ways.Is Room 14 haunted? Considering this is a Victorian novel, it very well might be.Give it a try if you like Wilkie Collins."
1,Not what I expected,I expected the book on audio. What I got was a 1.5 hour sales pitch. I read the book and liked it but this is not the book on audio.
5,Excellent Self-Motivational Tool,"Anthony Robbins, unlike his earlier book Unlimited Power, now provides the reader with more expansive techniques to perform a self transformation. NLP techniques have been eliminated from the book and I view that as a positive. Significant time is spent educating the reader on the importance of self understanding and examination of the inner self. Generating lists of personal goals, beliefs and values is once again encouraged. The importance of expanding your vocabulary in order to be a more effective communicator is discussed in detail. In fact, if the reader only views the chapters dedicated to vocabulary expansion and utilizes the authors suggestions the effects on your life will be profound. Once again, I believe that Mr. Robbins has provided the reader with an excellent starting point to self improvement."
2,Overrated,"The one thing Tony Robbins is good at is promoting himself, and he makes alot of money with his relentless marketing. Most of what you find here is either common sense, or nonsense. Some of the ideas are total fiction. If you liked L. Ron Hubbard's book ""Dianetics"", well, then maybe you will like this one. The Giant Within-gimme a break!"
3,Somewhat dated,"The advise contained in here, was very good a long time ago. Yeah, it is quite invigorating, but is like a quick fix. Times have changed since this was first released. More inteligent people will find better advise somewhere else. Anyway, a good read."
4,Pick and Choose some choice nuggets,"Sure, there's a lot to wonder about with Tony's overwhelming personality, self-promotion and huge ego.BUT ... if you can simply forget who wrote it, there are some wonderful pieces of information in this book. I've just started re-reading this book, and the chapter on goal setting is excellent. He's exactely right ... getting to the ""why"" of any goal is critical. If the ""why"" isn't strong enough, you're just wishing for something nice to happen. Commitment, focus, discipline, purpose ... these traits have all been known for centuries, but Tony actually does a nice job of creating motivation to make it happen. Read the book with a highlighter and go to work. It all comes from inside --- and Tony's organized some inspirational guidelines, for sure."
5,A recommended read!,Buried in Burrywood was a fun and exiting murder mystery. The author did a great job of introducing the characters without boring you with too many details about them. I really felt like I got to know the characters. I could not put the book down once I started reading it. It was full of twists all the way to the end. I can't wait for the next book!
4,"THE ""SOLDIER"" GETS FOUR STARS!","KING'S BLUES-GUITAR PLAYING IS GREAT! HIS VOICE IS ""THE BLUES"" PERSONIFIED. MY TWO FAVORITE NUMBERS ARE ""DRAWERS"" AND ""DON'T WANNA GO HOME"". I REALLY DIG KING'S BLUES-POWER. I ONLY WISH THAT THIS CD CONTAINED ALL STRAIGHT-UP BLUES....BUT THERE ARE ALSO R&B AND SOUL NUMBERS ON IT. HENCE THE 4 RATHER THAN 5 STAR RATING. I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT SOUL AND R&B, BUT WHEN I BUY A BLUES CD I WANT TO HEAR BLUES. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING: ""WHEN I DRINK WHISKEY, I DRINK WHISKEY....AN' WHEN I DRINK WATER, I DRINK WATER""?....WELL, THERE IT IS. JERSEY SLIM"
2,Its not all that,"This is hardly what I would call a great blues album. While there is no doubt that Jimmy can play, the disk leaves much to be desired. Far too many tunes here sound like the last one, or the one coming next. Sharing almost identical intros, bass lines and production arrangements. The mix is bass heavy leaving you straining to hear jimmy's work behind a tight (studio) rhythm section. Since there are far too many kudos to dismiss jimmy. I would look elsewhere for your first album from him. I am gonna buy the others just because of some of the covers I have heard of his stuff. Those tunes are just not on this album...my copy is going to in the used CD store 24 hours after I bought it.This guy is not going to wear the SRV crown (Mr. Milkowski), as if anyone should. Not with this disk anyway."
3,"Not bad for a short history, but could be better written","A mixed bag, this. Good for a brief exposure to some of the more renowned moments and movements in Irish history, but hard to follow at many spots. The early chapters seem to have been written by a different hand than the later. The language of the earlier ones is hard to follow and no coherent picture formed in my mind about that time. The later ones are easier because they're more ""newsy"" in style. You're only going to get the highlights of the times (up until mid-1984) and even those are at times disjointed, or strung together with facts the reader is presumed to already be familiar with.I borrowed this from the library. I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad I didn't buy it."
1,Internal motor and light housing completely smashed on arrival,"While a nice decoration, the internal motor and light housing arrived completely in pieces. I should have been worried when I saw the big orange insert warning to call the company and not to return the product if any pieces are missing or damaged. They clearly expect the problems with the quality control they apparently skipped. Do not buy!"
5,Great gift for popcorn lovers,"I bought this popcorn machine for my husband for Father's Day. He absolutely loves it! It was pretty simple to assemble and looks exactly like the picture. We did hve some trouble with delivery due to UPS breaking the 1st one shipped to us, but the seller quickly sent out a replacement with no hassle and kept in communication with me until it arrived so I was very happy with the service I received. Would definitely recommend the product to any avid movie watchers and popcorn lovers. It looks great in my husband's ""Man Cave""!"
1,very violent and inappropriate for young children,"I read this book to my 5 year old daughter last night and it was too traumatic for both of us. When the masked bandits ""hold a gun to her head"" and the later as she cries and says ""I don't want to die"", it is just too much graphic detail. If any kid were to write something like that, they'd probably undergo psychiatric evaluation. I don't even give it one star - stay away from this one."
1,the amazing bone,"My grandchildren age 5 and 3 cried when they read this book and wanted me to take it back and tell the man it is very, very scary...they have continued to go in detail about how awful and frightening this experience has been...I don't recommend this read..."
1,Creationist Garbage,"This represents yet more creationist fantasy. There is no science used to come to their conclusions as they already have their fairy tale answer. It amazes me the lengths creationists go to limit the way their supposedly ""all powerful"" god creates."
4,Maybe the single best all-around Clifford Brown CD,"Compact Jazz -- Clifford Brown is one of the best all-around Clifford Brown CD's ever produced. It shows the great range with which Clifford played -- from the ballad-like Stardust to the lightning-fast Blues Walk. This CD is also a great accompaniment to the book of Clifford Brown solo transcriptions. Grab your horn and just try to keep up! A trivial note: look for the track where Clifford Brown, Clark Terry, and Maynard Ferguson trade licks. Hear what inspired Arturo Sandoval to do an entire tribute album to Clifford. ---a MUST buy for any bebop lover."
4,Raving Fan,This phenomenal philosophy of customer care is told through a deceptively simple story. The message became more and more powerful to me over time. I would recommend this book to anyone who values customers and referrals in their business.
4,Raving Fans is OK,"Blanchard and Bowles have done another bang-up job with Raving Fans. Like their other book, Gung Ho!, Raving Fans is easy to read and is a good resource for anyone concerned with their organization's customer service. However, in my opinion, it's not a ""must buy""."
4,"""raving fan""","Good quality, really almost new. Highly satisfied, only wish it had arrived a little quicker. Ordered another used book at the same time from another Amazon source and it arrived 3-4 days sooner."
2,raving fans: a revolutionary approach to customer service,"this is a good book, with good solid business philosophy put across in a very readable, if a little campy, format. the frame stories are effective, but i think the essence of this work could have been communicated in even fewer pages."
2,Yet another over-rated business book...,"Remember ""Who Moved My Cheese""? How about ""One Minute Manager""?Why is it people don't have the intestinal fortitude to call a bad business book a bad business book? Everyone seems to feel obligated to pass on the titles of these tossed-off-in-an-afternoon-over-a-glass-of-wine books.This one in particular says you should give GREAT service, not just good service. Since that wouldn't be a very long book, the author adds in a string of totally-unrelated references to golf, since we all know all business people must pretend to be avid golfers.Save your time, and save your money. This is common sense packaged in a shiny wrapper."
1,You will loose an IQ point with every page you read.,"I read this book at the request of our manager and I feel as if I have been intellectually molested. Regurgitating trite catch phrases against the backdrop of every managers wetdream of mindlessly devoted automaton employees who seem content with their minimum wage jobs is not the best way to further motivate your own employees. The only thing that I learned from this senseless slaying of trees is that if an old man named Charlie, claiming to be my fairy godmother invites me into his car and tells me to close my eyes and not open them untill he says so, I should turn and run in the opposite direction."
2,Are they Raving Fans or an Escaping Stampede?,"This book was a gigantic disappointment. The whole ""male fairy godmother"" thing just insulted my intelligence from the beginning. What could have been an insightful book about real customer service impacts really ""lost it on the dismount."" The examples of customer strategy seemed forced and stretched beyond plausibility. The key character did not really seem to wrestle or grapple with many of the concepts. A business fable should inspire action, and this book simply did nothing. It wasn't a bad ""read"" per se. There were some entertaining facets, but it you are really looking to wow your customers and turn your business around, this is not the book for you. No matter how time-constrained you might be for a read on the topic, this will not be a good investment."
2,Decent Concept... Not My Style.,"I like the idea - focusing on good customer service. I don't like the way the book is written. Other books, like ""Fish"" (Stephen Lundin) do a better job of presenting a ""moral through a story."" They are teaching something new or inventive. Good 'customer service' is not a new concept. Conveying its importance through a simplistic story is, in my opinion, rather elementary my dear Blanchard.If these fictional characters were real people, and some good facts were thrown in, this could be a very good book. As it is, I think there are better ways - and books - to promote good customer service in an organization.The only redeeming quality is it is a quick read and therefore if you want to line Ken Blanchard's pockets... you can buy copies for your entire team and perhaps inspire some thought and get everyone on the same page. Unless you have team-building in mind though... seek wisdom elsewhere."
4,Raving Fans,This is a great motivational business book to read to get you inspired. It also reads easy and is slightly funny.
2,Not for Massage therapists,"This book is for couples who want to give each other a sensual massage. First of all, try giving a full body massage sitting next to someone on a bed, your back and shoulders will hurt. If Maxwell-Hudson is so serious about massage, why doesn't she have them on a massage table, which is proper. This sounds like a book about foreplay or sensual massage, not therapeutic massage. Someone with therapeutic intentions or who wants to get out knots or kinks will not benefit from this book. Some of the positions photographed are sexually suggestive. There may be technical discussion in this book, but it is out of place. The featured bodies may be beautiful, but not draped properly. This is not for professionals and to title this work The Complete Book of Massage is misleading at best."
4,A Treasure to Share,"As a pastor, I am always on the lookout for books that help not only myself, but others. This was the first book by Mahaney that I ever read and I loved it. The book reads like a sermon from a caring pastor, who himself is more than willing to be vulnerable.It contains not only sufficient biblical discussion of Humility to edify, but it aims for practical applications also.What comes through the loudest is Mahaney's reliance on the grace of God for all things, including walking in humility. I have given this book to many. I recommend to all Christians and probably need to read it again and again myself. So, don't just buy one copy! Get one to share."
4,Very Humbling,If you want to find out how wrong and prideful you are read this book. It was very enlightening.
2,"Essential book, but poor publishing from Eerdmans.","Berkhof's work itself is an essential document for the thinking Christian. With much of what one sees going on today, this is put into even sharper relief. This particular publishing is the `New Combined Edition', giving you a lengthy introductory work as well as the work proper, topping it out at over 900 pp. But the publishers cast it in a small book format. You have to forcibly hold the book open to read it. I would suggest getting the The Banner of Truth edition but I don't know if it will include the introduction."
1,Bad theology,This stuff could make the dictionary in a foreign language interesting. I never thought it would be possible to take something as glorious and wonderful as the Gospel and take all of the joy and wonder out of it. But Berkhof has succeeded. This is classic Federal Calvinism - Calvin would be rolling over in his grave.
4,Great product,Love this stuff. Use it after each wash. Extends the life of the wax job and leaves it just as smooth as when you thourghly waxed it.
3,Very different from previous Quick Detailer,Seems like they changed their formula with this one compared to the previous version they had. This one doesn't wipe away as cleanly as the old one and takes a lot more wiping to get it as shiny as the previous version. I don't know why they changed it up. I will be looking for a different brand until they fix this formula.
5,Perfect for water marks/droppings/dirt/etc!,"I own a Black Charger and was tired of seeing the water marks and occasional dirt/spots in-between car washes.This removes almost everything, although, there hasn't been anything that it hasn't been able to remove for me yet though (Ex: Water marks, bird droppings, tree sap, dirt, dust)!Quick and simple process:1. Spray on spot2. Wipe away with Micro-fiber cloth3. Done!Enjoy!"
2,"A Cheap, Skipping Product...","There is a reason why this is only 20$. I bought this because all I wanted was something to play CDs... It isn't skip proof so when ever you even touch the CD player it will start skipping... I recommend this to the people who have a flat, stable surface, a small money purse, and an mp3 player. This should only be bought so that you have a way of testing the CDs you may or may not want...I love my CD player anyway..."
5,I finally got it and it was worth the wait!,This is great music for drawing and driving. I play this CD in my painting class. Its both relaxing + rhythmic enough not to be distracting. Really good stuff -- go to a concert!
2,A Sad Re-Hash,While I'm a Big Marvin Gaye Fan this Collection does nothing for me whatsoever.been there&done that a ton of times already.Marvin Gaye is bound to Have more Material that hasn't surfaced yet that would better be Welcomed instead of 50 ways to Promote the same thing over&over again.
4,Over the top and not what you think,"If you're expecting some type of werewolf/slavering beast type o' book then yer gonna get a surprise. Imagine, if you will, the Texas Chainsaw Masscre done as a generation spanning saga. This is great pulp! I've no idea what happened to this author which is a shame because another novel of his, Biships' Landing, is a classic haunted house yarn. Very visual, jump-cut writing. Treat yourself!"
2,Didn't last long,Set-up was easy but our goal didn't last long before the poles poked through the fabric at the top. Duct tape added a bit of time but the product didn't even last a year with moderate use.
4,Used book purchase,"The book arrived on time, but in what I would describe as ""fair"" condition not ""good"" as advertised in the seller's description. Many pages were annotated by the previous owner(s) in a variety of colors of ink. However, the price was right and the book is usable. I would order from this seller again."
2,"Chemistry, the Central Science.",I am a teacher using this book for an AP Chem class. I have found the book very difficult to use. Topics are rather disconnected and most of my students had trouble following the logic of more difficult subjects. The early chapters are particularly difficult. I have also found numerous mistakes with the materials available to teachers. The number of errors on the power point presentations are ridiculous. I also questions some of the answers with regards to the use of significant fiqures.The Web Site is excellent even though I only use the standard version and not the electronic chapters. The solution manual is so-so. Sometimes shortcuts are used without explanation which is dangerous for AP students.I would not recommend this book for use in the high school classroom from the point of view of both the teacher using the books and materials and the student attempting to learn from the book.
2,good support to Silberberg's,"I really enjoyed the text written by Silberberg:[...]and only bought the ""Central Science"" edition because it was required and the questions for required problems were unique. It has a different teaching method, different flow, and simply far less interesting to me.Good luck,"
2,Good textbook but..,"This was a good textbook, but it is kind of childish. Let me explain. The author explains things assuming we're dumb. A textbook should convey the information in a professional matter. Not like ""So here's the deal, if you look at those electrons... ,"" blah blah.. the author is talking to a child.. basically.....I found Raymond Chang's 6th Edition of CHemistry to be more straight forward. I don't like the ""JARGON"" in textbooks. That should be left to professors and university itself. Although, people who skip classes would like this textbook, I wouldn't keep it for reference (too much jargon, hard to get and find the point)."
5,The Tool to Pass General Chemistry,"This book is simply great. i've seen one or two other books during my two years of study in chemistry (AP and college), and this book was the best. The concepts are presented so clearly, great diagrams, and great problems at the end. The book is VERY student friendly. If you read it carefully, it'll help you greatly in studying (and passing) AP or college level chemistry."
4,Sheltie was just right,Our little sheltie dog passed away suddenly and we needed something to remind us of his happy life. The Plush Dixie Sheltie is soft and friendly and is just what we needed.
2,Are these supposed to be disposable units?!?,"I think the the Clarion Calypso is a nicely designed unit with a great menu system and wonderful features for a plug-and-play satellite receiver. I just wish I could listen to mine more. Like another reviewer here my unit suffers from a defect and getting it repaired is a frustrating affair. When my receiver gets warm it will throw up the ""Acquiring signal"" warning on the display. Sometimes after several minutes the unit will come back and play fine. Other times it will be out for the day. It is not an antenna problem or a signal problem. There is a defect within the unit itself. During the summer months it is pretty much dead all the time.They should refer to this as a Sirius disposable radio."
2,"OK while it lasted, but it didn't last long.","I bought from an authorized dealer, and had it professioanlly installed. Everythng worked well for almost a year, then the unit became unreliable. After a few minutes, apparently after the thing gets warm, the display reads ""Acquiriung Signal"". After first I blamed Sirius, but after a few days I realized it must be the Calypso itself. Sometimes it might start working again if I turn it off for a while, but for the most part the unit is gone.I am very disappointed. Modern electronics usually last much longer, especially when no moving parts are involved. Since I have seen others complaining about this same issue, I would have to recommend you avoid the Calypso. Shame on Clarion."
3,Don't make the same mistake I made,"I purchased this course and learned a lot from it. I wanted to continue my lessons with another course from the same company so I purchased Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat. When it arrived I started playing the first CD and to my shock, it was Behind the Wheel Spanish under a different name. I returnd this item and only received a 50% refund. So this mistake cost me almost $$$. So do not order this item if you have already purchased Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat."
5,Behind The Wheel Spanish,"I bought this for my brother for Christmas who has a 1 hr drive to work and home everyday and his car doesn't have a CD player.He loves it! He says the instructor speaks very clearly,he repeats the words and phrases twice then gives you time to repeat it.He also likes the fact that the tape is set up in chapters so if he wants to go back to the beginning of a chapter it automatically does it when he hits rewind,he doesn't have to search for it. He can already say simple phrases and he knew absolutely no spanish prior to receiving this.He says he likes it because he doesn't have to have a book to follow while he is listening like some of the other more expensive instruction packages.He is VERY pleased with it,it is exactly what he was looking for!I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!!!!!"
5,Fabulous Tea - Beware of Quantities,"I love this tea. Have been ordering it from another source for years. I always ordered six boxes at a time so I would never run out. Amazon carries it in a six box case. I inadvertently ordered six boxes of the six-box case. So rather than ordering my usual six boxes, I ended up with 36 boxes. As this comes from a third party vendor, there was no way to return any of the boxes once I realized what had happened.So if you are used to ordering this from another website, be sure you order only what you need.It is a good thing I really like this tea...."
5,The end of a world,"During his last days, a stooped Adolf Hitler shuffled through the corridors of his underground bunker in Berlin. Sometimes he had to stop and lean against the concrete walls, because he had trouble keeping his balance. Hitler appeared to be at the point of complete physical collapse, but that appearance was deceptive. He still had a ferocious will to destroy, and he would keep that will to the very end. ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" tells the story of that end. This is a short book, but there is much depth of understanding within it. There is understanding about Hitler's motivation and real purpose, and the total destruction of the world that he created in Germany between 1933 and 1945. The final wave of nightmarish events that took place in Hitler's bunker are vividly described in this book. From these pages it is clear that Hitler's only legacy to Germany and the world was one of utter devastation and ruin."
3,Disappointment,"I'm an avid WWII reader, so it was with great anticipation that I began reading this book. The mystery surrounding Hitler's last days in the bunker, is such an unknown. Any book that attempts to shed light on this period in history becomes an instant best-seller.As the title of my review indicates, I am very disapointed in Joachim Fest's book. It is entirely too short and just doesn't begin to scratch the surface.There are many other works out there such as the work narrated by one of Hitler's secretarys Traudl Junge, that goes much deeper than this book.I read Fest's book in three hours and set it on the shelf feeling like I was cheated. The book is incomplete at best!"
3,The last days of Hitler.,"Personally, I like this author and I have a few of his books. This one was an average read because in a brief 200 pages, Fest describes the last days of Hitler. Trevor Roper's book even though ancient gives a better picture of the last days of Hitler than Fest's book. In Fest's book, one gets glimpses of Hitler in his last days of life. Gone are the great expectations of German Empire, and one can get a glimpse of the crazy man who led Germany for 12 years. Fest gives only glimpses of Hitler and life in the bunker. One cannot get a definitive account of all the activities of that period. One can get a better image with Trever Roper's book.I enjoyed some of the information in this book, but definitive it is not. There are better books out there than this, so if one wants a summary, this is a nice book. However if one wants a more through book, they should look elsewhere."
3,Inside Hitler's Bunker,"I had expected more of this book. It is rather small compared to other books on the subject. One might describe it an an overview of the subject. So if you're interested in a quick read taking a non-detailed look at the subject, then, by all means read it. If the subject of Hitler's last days piques your interest after reading it, then I'd recommend James P O'Donnell's very complete book, ""The Bunker"", available from Amazon."
4,"Not sonnet collection, but a scholarly work","You might be fooled by the title. This is an interesting scholarly look at Shakespeare's sonnets, as the title makes clear. I found this book while reading an article that cited it. What led me to the text was a claim that some sonnet passages were in some plays, and I wanted to find out where these passages were. Unfortunately, that bit was pretty speculative and not well supported. There were a lot of ""this reads the way passage X in Romeo and Juliet reads"" and that sort of thing. I expected verbatim, or near verbatim passages. Guess I showed my ignorance on that on, but that's the only gripe. If you want a way to learn more about the sonnets and make better sense of them, this book will do you well."
5,an Inspireing story,this is one of the best books I have ever read. Since I used to be a care giver myslef I can relate to some of he must have gone threw. It is an inspireing book and I will recommend it to everyone to read.
5,Catch Erin Now!,"I've been following Erin McKeown since she was a 19-year-old Brown student playing a ten-minute set at the open stage of a local coffeehouse. Her emotional intensity and uniquely compelling voice were backed by her unusually skilled guitar playing, and I wanted to hear more.Since then, she has only gotten better. Distillation is an apt name for an album that pulls together the sound Erin has been honing for years through constant touring and intense dedication. Her songs are smart, sexy and well-played, and there is no one on the scene quite like her. Catch her now, because chances are good that she'll be huge soon enough."
4,"Very good, but not perfect!","Robert Smith is one of the finest alternative vocalists I've heard in a long time. He comes second to Ville Valo of HIM fame. I'd never bought anything by The Cure before, because I'd never heard of them. But I watched MTV Icon celebrating them and got interested.This is a really really good album, and my favourite songs include 'Boys Don't Cry', 'A Forest', 'The Lovecats', 'Wrong Number', 'Pictures Of You', 'Why Can't I Be You?' and 'Inbetween Days', amongst others. I recommend someone who is just getting into Th Cure to get this cd, it is very cool.I don't like track 4 much though, I would skip it definitely."
4,Solid Greatest Hits Compilation,"The tracks chosen are The Cure's more up-tempo, high energy pop songs. Perhaps this will not satisfy the hardcore fan, but I think the tracks on this CD are well chosen for those who are not acquainted with The Cure's body of work or didn't grow up listening to alternative music in the 80's. Not a good retrospective compilation, but a solid greatest hits collection. It has a good choice of songs to introduce The Cure to a new generation."
2,massively overrated,"Rick Linklater brought this movie off on a shoestring budget: it follows, without a story, the various reflections of residents in the student ghetto area of UT Austin.I've always thought this movie was greatly overestimated: there are some good lines, but not really ""dialogue."" Pretty much all the characters talks the same: like Richard Linklater, presumably. It's really just a continuous, occasionally amusing monologue that simply drifts from one character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is."
4,Interesting Slice of Life,"""Slacker"" is a very interesting film. It is a freak show of conspiracy theorists, anarchists, and simple do-nothings. The camera will follow one story line, then will follow another character to wherever he goes, and so on. Though this style prevents the audience from really being anything but an observer of this world, Richard Linklater has made a very engaging film. I zoned out once or twice during some of the longer monologues, but that's what the other characters did in the scene, I'm sure. I've watched this film three times since I got it. I hope a DVD edition, with a commentary by Linklater, is in the pipeline."
2,Seriously - don't waste your money,We have had these now for a couple of months and they are already breaking. I didn't listen to all those reviewers who called these a piece of crap - and I should of. I bought 2 and the one has some kind of leak so milk leaked down into the NON waterproof battery compartment (seriously - see that nice black ring on the bottom - THAT's the battery comparement). It's a cute novel idea but a total hunk of junk. SUPER disappointed.
2,Too much moooo-la,This is a toy. Flimsey. Doesn't have much mix muscle. Only for kids mixing chocolate powder or syrup. Just like the description says. Don't expect it to do anything else. Might be cute for half the price.
1,Bad buy,"I bought one of these for each of my chocolate milk-loving daughters for Christmas. They used them for each of their meals that day and again the next. The next time we went to use them, neither one worked. Changed the batteries in both thinking that was the problem. Nope...still didn't work. Not worth the money or your child's disappointment."
1,Moo Mixer Review,It worked great for about 3 months before the gasket wore out it sprang a leak. I expect a product I purchase to last longer then 3 months so I'd say I got ripped off!!!! Not recommended!!!!
4,Real and Tested praise music!,"This group knows how to rock! They have tested their music on churches all over the U.S. They just don't sit in a studio and record, they went out and experienced how to give glory to God in real churches. Buy this now!"
4,Targus Cooling stand,"This lightweight portable stand is the perfect tool to raise my huge 18"" Toshiba laptop to the perfect typing level. I looked at the reviews for many other styles, and this one fits the bill.As this laptop does not seem to get hot, I didn't buy its for it cooling factor.I would recommend this to all laptop users!"
5,Excellent option to keep your laptop cool.,This is enough to keep your laptop cool. No need for usb-powered fans or complicated setups.
3,BETTER DAYS,Sound quality is terrible. Probably recorded from an LP. I am a die hard Guy Clark fan and he never wrote or recorded a bad song. I have all his music and purchased this because it was not previously released on cd.
4,lost in the translation,"read this years ago and am thrilled to find it again. i remember that the translation from the french was horribly mangled, but the story was so good, it overcame. would make an excellent movie. (talented mr. ripley is kinda similar concept). i even think that a better translation would take away from some of its charm :)"
4,25 Years of Louisiana Music on Rounder Records,"It may seem odd, but Massachusetts-based Rounder Records has become the pre-eminent label recording the music of Louisiana. From such classic New Orleans artists as Professor Longhair, Johnny Adams and Irma Thomas, to Cajun stalwarts D.L. Menard, Bruce Daigrepont and Steve Riley, to the Kings of Zydeco, Boozoo Chavis and Beau Jocque, Rounder is dedicated to playing its part in continuing this rich tradition of joyous and unique music. This budget priced double CD features these artists, as well as Marcia Bell, Champion Jack Dupree, James Booker, The Balfa Brothers, Jimmy C. Newman, Buckwheat Zydeco, Beausoleil and others, making this one of the finest and most comprehensive colllections of Louisiana music available."
4,Great Cajun/Zydeco Primer,"Great Cajun/Zydeco PrimerFor those new to the genre, this compilation is the right place to start. It introduces the listener to a good cross section of both artists and styles, and presents a showcase of the rich diversity found in Louisiana music. There is probably something for just about everyone here."
4,Good shirt but has a logo on the sleeve.,The shirts fit well and I'm happy with them. They had a small C logo glued onto the sleeve though which I had to remove with rubbing alcohol. There is a glue outline left on the black shirts and the logo's blue and red ink stained the white shirts. In both cases it's so slight it's unnoticeable unless you're looking for it and I'm sure I could remove them completely if I cared to.
5,T-Shirts Are Strong and Comfortable,"Ordered these for my husband and he loved them. They wash and dry and don't shrink or fade. Champion is a great brand.Champion 6.1 oz Cotton Tagless T-shirt with ""C"" Logo in Black - XX-Large"
5,Fun book to read and very helpful,"Chris Tomlin put many of his own stories in the book, which I learned a lot from. It is also very helpful that Chris put some guidance about how to prepare to lead a worship session. Recommand to all worship leaders."
2,Did not keep my attention,"This book just didn't keep my attention. I set it down after two or three chapters and didn't pick it up again. It's more about how they came up with the songs and the music and less about the band. If you are an avid musician and/or song writer you may love it. But I just listen to the music and like the stories of the band. I've read other books about Nirvana, the Doors, and the Grateful Dead and loved them. But I couldn't really get in to this one. I actually just boxed it up over the weekend and put it in the attic. Maybe I'll give it a try later. Maybe not."
5,It's rockin' good news!,"A knowledge of David Lynch films might help to understand the selection, but it isn't neccessary to love every song. Though ""Wild At Heart"" offers metal, oldies, and rockabilly, most of it is cool and collected. Two tracks of the ""kings"", and two from Chris Isaak are great, but it's the odd-balls and instrumentals that make this essential. ""Perdita"" is one of the coolest things I've ever heard in my life. However, the BEST reason to own this soundtrack, is to hear Nicolas Cage sing the two Elvis songs. Now that's cool. I may as well also say this is likely my favorite movie of all time. Enjoy."
4,Pretty Darn Good,I used to never listen to country music but Jo Dee Messina's clear and warm-voiced tone and lovable songs (prominently featured on this album) rock!
5,Jo Dee's better than ALRIGHT!!!!!,"This was the best gift I have EVER received!!... It came into my life two years ago and still can still be found playing on my CD player as much as it was back then!!... Jo Dee has what I like to call ""Bundled Talent"" - if you liked any of Jo Dee's songs... then you'll love this all out album... If you've never even heard of Jo Dee... then will yourself to buy it... it is worth every cent and then some!!...:pThis is the exact CD that my family and friends received as Christmas gifts from me last year!!...6 stars out of 5 for this one!!"
5,Very talented. The most underated singer today. Just Awesome,"When is comes to new country talent, JoDee Messina has all the right characteristics to hit it big. Although she hasn't gotten the recognition that she deserves, her music inspires anyone who listens. Her voice is pure and her passion shines through her songs. The new CD, I'm Alright, is a perfect example of how talented she really is. Very refreshing and passionate in her vocals and lyrics."
4,"Great CD, but not quite as good as the first","Jo Dee is the greatest, but I can't help but feel that this second album isn't as great as her first. It's a great ""sing in the car"" CD. I, like Sarah, from Worcester, saw Jo Dee at the WKLB fest in June, and she was AWESOME. She is definitely on the road to bigger and better things."
2,Another great story,Young woman has lost her father and learned that he had a secret life before including a wife and sister. Rather than embrace it she lies and sneaks around behind peoples backs. Disappointing because it had a lot of promise.
2,Poor track handeling on a well laid out setup.,Nice to look at however it does not handle switch tracks 50% of the time. Not a good value for your dollar unless you are doing a simple 22inch loop.
4,Classic. What else can I say?,"My uncle went to US in the past and found this cd. Loved it! But once back to his country, lost it.Was hard to find it again, but I could find.If you like blues, you must have it.Just check the list of tracks and you will know."
2,No Substance in this Book,"Well not a good book at all. If you don't have anything else in the office to read or do...and just want to know what Reporting services is all about, you can go throught the book in few hours."
3,slasher flick from 1981,"Bloody moon is a Spanish slasher flick from 1981. It's like a refreshing version of Friday the 13th with bad dubbing, nonsensical dialogue and bad editing. The film is so hilarious, it's set in a language school where the girls talk endlessly about boys, ""Antonio is the best lover on campus...you can have a go of him if you like"" the boys say things like ""oh baby, I want you to melt in my arms"".The best moment, however is when a girl is picked up in a car by a man in a mask. He takes her to an old mill and ties her to a table connected to a buzzsaw. Only when he switches on the saw does she finally get suspicious.It's a trash movie addicts delight, but others beware."
5,best ppc of this year and 2005,"john cena wins the chamber but then edge uses money in bank after the match and wins the wwe champion ship its rules edge thnz 4 beating johncenathis chamber was crap kane was in 3 min andkurt was in4 7 min and shawn got took be carlito and 2 rolls up at the end cena wins,edge we champion 4 ages , u rule"
4,Amazing raw and passionate debut,"I loved this album when it was released and was pleased to pick it up on CD again a few years ago. Fabulously melodic power pop songs, with sparkling tight arrangements, I was blown away by the songwriting and performances. I'd seen this band play the first ever gig (I think) supporting a band called QED at the Baggot Inn in Dublin a couple of years before this debut LP. I love every song here, and enjoyed the spat between Craig Walker and Bono back in the day -- I do think that U2 ended up better for it :-)"
3,Review nearly 40 years later,"I read this book in 1965 as a freshman in Chemistryat UCLA. I had no background in group theory or representationof groups by characters. It started me on a life long study of groups,but the wrong way. For someone without the necessary mathematics backgroundthis book is actually harmful.I think a course in modern algebra should be necessaryto reading this book. In 1965 an understanding of Calculuswasn't enough even with a little Boolean algebra mixed in.It came down to us using the book like a recipe bookfor the mathematics, following many of the operating blindly.But I have to say that over the years I have learned more about groupsand that the approach here has grown in my respect with that study.So I have to say it is an excellent bookfor those preparedand a very poor book for those who aren't."
4,Primer for dissecting vibrational chemistry,"This book provides a clear and direct link between ""group theory"" as a mathematic topic and ""spectroscopy"" as a physical chemical topic. It provides advanced methods for determining the symmetry of molecules, and how to predict the physical observable effect of the molecular symmetry, such as Raman or normal vibrational spectroscopy. Useful background for chemists who will use vibrational spectroscopic techniques in structural determinations."
4,Rescure Hero Fan,"This is one of my son's favorite toys. He loves all of the Mission Select items, but mom is disappointed with this one. After playing with it for a month, the front ""claw"" that shoots out has broken off. My son is very meticulious about his toys and takes very good care of them so I was shocked when he said it had broken. I would still buy the item buy beware of the pieces that may break off, they are sharp."
5,Good product!!!,Just came back from Disney trip. It's a great product especially when it's a 100 degrees outside. I am not sure if you can fit six 12oz bottle... I've used it for baby food (3 or 4 jars)I would also recommend to use ice packs. Worked great!!! Stroller folds with no problem!!!
1,Warning,"Warning, if you are buying this for a baby jogger city select, don't bother, it does not fit. Must fit a much smaller baby jogger."
3,"A little disconcerting, but still enjoyable.","Herriot's third collection of loosely autobiographical tales of veterinary practice in the Yorkshire dales ostensibly takes place while he is serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II. However, most of the chapters only begin with a paragraph or two about his military life which inevitably reminds him of someone or some animal-related event from his past. This was mildly disconcerting as the connections between the RAF event and the story to follow are sometimes quite a stretch. The tales are still quite entertaining and enjoyable, although it becomes slightly more clear that what is being related is becoming a bit more fictionalized than the incidents contained in the first two books of the series."
3,Promising,"As the cold weather makes itself felt here in northern New England I was looking for an easy read that might remind me of warmer climates and be entertaining. Bob Morris's first effort did that although I agree with others here who felt the book lacked the pace you would like to see in a book such as this. If Morris intends to join the ranks of some of the other Florida/Bahama novelists he is going to have to crank it up a bit, but for a first effort is does have promise."
3,Decent start to a new series.,"This is not a ""great"" mystery novel, but it is a decent read if you have a minute. The story centers around Zack Chasteen, a recently released, wrongly acccused ex-football player/ex-con. A little of the action is hokey at times, a couple of the characters hard to believe and one side story that is omnipresent but handled in a rapid, throw it in there at the last minute, manner. But all-in-all the novel was a promising start to a new series. Though not a fan of most of the ""Florida"" mystery authors, Morris seems to be off to a decent start. Worth a look at least."
2,Decent plot but content falls short,"We occasionally watch a movie as family (with young kids) and try to seek films that are appropriate for the whole family. I acquired this film based on the positive reviews, including endorsements as a ""family movie."" However, after watching it, I would not recommend it for young viewers, or for anyone who wants to avoid indecency. There is quite a bit of profanity as well as a bedroom scene involving an unmarried couple. Compared to many movies, this may be mild, but overall this greatly detracts from what could have been wholesome family viewing."
2,What a surprise? I thought it would earn an Academy Award!!!,"Disapointing and a waiste of your time! James Mardsen (Disturbing Behavior) plays a high school football player who falls for Marley Shelton ( Valentine) the cheerleading squad captain after she accidentally knocks him out while doing a flip at a prep-alley. After they suddenly elope and she gets pregnant, tehy need some quick cash, so her and the cheerleading squad plan a bank robbery. But, first they must watch tons of bank robbery movies to get ideas. Second, they needs unloaded guns, so they make a deal with a gun-seller to make his skinny daughter into a cheerleader. During the robbery, the laughs happen there and one of the high-school students notices that the girls dressed in doll costumes are cheerleaders after they do a cheering move to spray-paint the cameras. So I about told you the plot! You decide!RATED PG-13 FOR LANGUAGE, VIOLENCE, SEXUAL MATERIAL."
4,Get ready to cheer for the bad girls!!,"Sugar and Spice is about a group of cheeleaders who are also bank robbers and best friends!For the Lincoln High A-squad cheering comes easy, but when team captain Diane falls in love with the star quarterback, Jack it leads to some unexpected problems for the pair. That's when she calls on her friends to help out with her goal; to rob the local bank branch she works for. The rebel of the bunch, Kansas masterminds the plan for the most outrageous heist this small town has ever seen.I own this movie and I think it's really cute and a fun comedy about the way friendship should be! I love how all of Diane's friends are there for her throughout this whole movie and they never back down! Overall, this movie is really carefree and saucy! The deleted scenes are really good too! :) I recommend this to all!"
3,"NOT VERY FUNNY, but with the beautiful Mena Suvari","This is just another teen movie, but specially for women.Is not very funny either, but it's OK.I hope you like it and rated better than me.And please excuse me for my terrible enlgish.Bye!!"
3,It was entertaining...,"Some of the story lines are far fetched but it is entertaining if you are in the mood for comedy type entertainment and not serious drama. It is a typical high school movie with the charachters being the popular cheerleaders who date the popular boys, etc. It has humorous parts and in the end you are hoping that they do not get caught/charged with robbing the bank. The girl that was in American Beauty is in this, her charachters name is Kansas. It is a different role than I have seen her play in American Pie or American Beauty but she still does a fine job. Get it for entertainment value...don't expect it to be up for an academy award though."
1,You have got to be kidding,"First off, the story took forever to get started. These girls decide to rob a bank within a grocery store to finance the future of the pregnent one. The characters were two dimensional at best including the villian and the boyfriend. I didn't laugh once the whole time. THe characters were intended to be very different from each other, but in the end, just acted like a bunch of airheads.I am sure the story looked good on paper, but once it hit the screen, it was too long and drawn out for a comedy. If you want to laugh, rent Cannonball Run or Airplane. If you want a seditive, Sugar & Spice is for you."
4,Entertaining Camelot,An entertaining soundtrack with a mix of pop music with great voices delivery songs that made the charts as well as some exciting orchestral tunes. For those who enjoy soundtracks this one delivers a Disney-style feel like that of the Tarzan or Hercules soundtrack.
3,music,"I was not completely satisfied with this product. When the CD arrived, two of the tracks will not play."
5,It touches the heart,"I recently lost my dad and all of the songs revolve around a girl who has just lost her dad and is trying to 'find' herself. She's looking for independance, and I can totally relate to that. I especially love 'The Prayer' and 'My Father's Wings'. They are truly inspiring."
3,Not Quite Up to Par,"Marci Pliskin and Shari L. Just wrote this manual on ""Interpreting Your Dreams."" I found their ideas ordinary. Keeping a dream journal, looking for colors or recurring events, these are not news. The index to the book offers the main subjects, not always the subjects I sought.It is probably the editing that created such a superficial look at dreams. The series seems aptly titled."
2,Better Left in my Dreams,"I love the dream scape and the methodology of interpretation so I was excited to get this lil diddy.......until it arrived, not only does it NOT cover the most basic of dreams ie colors, people, places, things, it does little to provide more then cursory insights which left me dumbfounded and exasperated. On the other hand, if you are just looking for a bit of fun, have at it.....you and the book will be best buds!"
1,LeAnn's worst CD so far,"What happened to the melodic singing that I heard on LeAnn's first CD, Blue? Where are the easiness and naturalness when she sings? They certainly aren't in this CD. In her songs, she forces the notes out so hard that it sounds really unnatural and very hard to listen to. Most of the upbeat songs are okay, but the slow songs are boring! Her voice and the way she sings do not sound good on this CD."
5,GREAT!!!,"This cd shows the range of music that LeAnn can cover. ""These Arms of Mine"" sounds like a country classic. Country Music should not turn its back on someone who has brought so many new fans to country."
3,Review of Sittin' on Top of the World - Leann Rimes,"So, yes, this album is a bit all over the place, departures from what came before, some disappointments and some new things that are good enough but we're not sure HOW good yet.This album is worth hearing because Leann is a little more the thinker and experimenter now. You can tell by the mixed reviews. That's OK. I'm sure we'll be seeing more of her that is more the expected expansion of her previous popular songs. Leann needs this kind of album to help her enjoy her work, which is tantamount to us loving that sound. And even the things you hate about Sittin' are going to come back in a good way in future albums... these things will inform Leann and her dad so they really will Rime next time. Ceriusly.Oh, I wish I didn't have to assign the album stars--I'd rather just let what I say stand alone, it's more valuable than how I personally would rate the album on a schoolgirl ABCDF scale."
3,"Great voice, but not a country singer","Rimes has a tremendous voice; no one will doubt that. However, she is not, as she wants to be classified, a country singer. This album is great if you are a fan of Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey, where light weight songs and an overpowering voice carries a single to the top of the chart, but if you are looking for Reba, skip this album."
1,YUCK,I do not like this cd. LeAnn has such a big head! She thinks she is all this and some of that with a cherry on top! Ugggh! How can you people stand her? Here's some advice: CHECK OUT LILA MCCANN AND BUY HER MUSIC INSTEAD OF leann's. You definatly get your money's worth with LILA but NOT with LeAnn!
2,Campfire stories,"I thought this was going to be more new age along the lines of ENIGMA, Steven Halpern, or Merlin's Magic. Imagine my disappointment when I learned ""Celestial Navigations"" were cowboy/trucker stories. Monotone speech with barely discernable backround music."
3,A Pretty Good Last Sequel,"It starts off with a 19 year old girl looking for her mother in Gatlin only to find Isaac the original COTC leader in a coma. When she touches his hand it wakes him up and kicks off mysterious events of a some kind of prophecy. I won't spoil anything else for those who have not seen it. Not as good as some of the earlier enteries, but overall it was pretty good. Decent acting especially by John Franklin and this seemed to have the biggest budget out of the all of them. It also has a twist ending that's not if you don't figure it out early in the movie. Although, this should of been No.2 instead of No.6."
3,Movie,I love all Stephen King movies an especially the Children of the Corns.This one was good.Not one of his best but it was good.
4,Good Paper,"The paper has a nice tooth and is fairly absorbent, and keeping it on the block until the paint has dried ensures that your painting doesn't warp. Getting the paper off of the block can be a little tricky without scissors or an exacto knife, but that is to be expected. My only complaint is that the paper block separated from the cardboard that it was mounted to so that the actual paper block is loose inside the green cover. Not a big deal, just a nuisance."
3,Too expensive...,"I think it's going to be a good direction to a new beginner.But it's too expesive and too slim. I thought it might be plenty of questions and answers before I bought it.When I received this book from Amazon.com, it occured to me that I had better try an actual exam with $55 instead of buying it."
1,Is That All There Is?,"$55 for this little thing? Yes, I read the page count before I bought it, but c'mon, the font is huge, and there is one question per page.You could read the entire book sitting on the commode with time to spare. A complete ripoff. I am returning it. Shame on you, Barry Fewer."
3,Too Short,"The first book on Grant that I read was ""Grant- The Soldier and the Man"" by Edward Longacre.This was a wonderful insight into Grant and certainly exposing his personal foibles. The details into Grant's life from childhood through the Civil War were wonderfully presented.I had just finished biographies on Lincoln and Johnson and was hungry for more reading on the post civil war era. Unfortunately, Longacre ended the book right after Grant was elected president- which is why I purchased Bunting's work.The first 90 pages are an abbreviation of Grant's life through the war. Not nearly as detailed or informative as Longacre's.The book ends 60 pages later and frankly, it kept me wanting for more. It just skimmed over too much of Grant's presidency (and hardly touches on his life after he was president).Other reviewers have lauded this book. In my opinion, the author seems to have been in too much of a hurry to finish it and could have certainly provided a much more in depth rendition."
3,Fowl Play,"A cute story where a fox delivers as promised. A second twist is the perceived evil triumphs and the victim, a human being is no wiser."
4,The Poseidon Adventure (2005 TV Movie) (Widescreen Edition),This was a good mini series not as good as the original but entertaining non the less. At the price you can't go wrong if you just want something to watch and kill a few hours. I loved the original so I gave it a shot and I do not feel like it was a waist of money or anything.
4,a great introductory CD set for bluegrass lovers,"I used to think that country-western was my favorite, but these 2 CDs made it clear that bluegrass is better. These CDs have so much variety, its impossible to NOT find one that you'll love. Its my favorite while driving!"
1,Flex Clip Copy Holder = Piece of Crap,Ordered on Feb 2. Recieved it around Feb 5. The thing broke around Feb 8. This is a poorly made item piece of garbage. The internal spring is sooo strong it applies too much pressure on the clip and the clip breaks itself.Do NOT buy.
3,mindless entertainment,"This book was goofy and dated the minute it hit the presses, but as long as you turn off your brain, it's pleasant enough."
2,Goofy and predictable,I'm not really sure why this literary turd is being gushed over. I found it tedious. Ready Player One is what you want to read.
5,Written over fifteen years ago... still worth reading!,"I have no idea how I missed this gem. He uses concepts and coins words and phrases that did not exist until he wrote the book. The plot is absolutely ingenious, and even better.... plausible (if you are willing to stretch that imagination :))! I don't want to give any story away, just give my two cents that this is an important book to read in order to understand the cyberpunk genre and even more important to understand the direction of cyberpunk trends.One caveat - the grammar, phrasing, and vocabulary are typical cyberpunk.... if you are used to reading only the king's english - you might not enjoy so much! Otherwise, dig in!!I highly recommend this book!All the best,Jay"
2,Parts would be good - if it had an ending but it didn't. It Stopped.,"Parts were very good - if it had an ending but it didn't. It just Stopped.And all the ""Ominous"" things that would happen ""If & When"" DIDN'T!"
3,Evolutionary Sci-Fi,"Given the great Sci-Fi that exists, I could not give this book five stars. Its drawback is that it will appeal to a narrow audience, but that includes me (maybe I should give it 4 stars). After an exciting start, we are led to puzzle that draws from the evolutionary theory of thinking and language. Very interesting, particularly if you are into memes, evolution, language, and programming. Not so fascinating if you are looking for a general and exciting Sci-Fi read.There is also some Japanese sword-play and some motorcycle chases. They are always fun, but they too, could be better.In sum, it is the right book if you are looking for a Sci-Fi book playing on the theme of the evolutionary selection of ideas and language. Otherwise I would pass it."
3,Had its good points,"I really liked the speculative science fiction in this book. The characters were great, and I even liked the story when it was moving. But I got bored with the chapters on philosophy; it slowed the pace of the book just when things were getting good."
4,"If You Haven't Read This Yet, It's Not Too Late...","Ten years ago, Neal Stephenson wrote Snow Crash, a book that is still considered a definitive work in the field of Virtual Reality Multi-User Worlds. This is the book that has and will continue to shape developments in VR; it is unlikely that you will find anyone in the VR field that has not read and been influenced by this book.Unfortunately, this book is only available now in a larger print format in paperback at a substantially higher price than many people are willing to pay... you won't find a trade paperback for sale that is brand new because that version seems to be out of print. I know because I've looked. <P..."
4,Hacker Galore!,A good book with a lot of twists and turns. The only thing that it lacks is a better ending!
2,Save your time and money,"While Neil Stephenson shows some promise in this book, which will later show up as full-blown talent in Cryptonomicon, this is one of his works that is best avioded. The characters are two-dimensional, the setting is poorly thought out, and the ""science"" behind the eponymous drug and the mysterious illness related to it is no contrived and patently impossible as to cause a reader physical pain. There are some cute moments and good ideas in this book, but not enough to redeem it. This is one of Stephenson's earlier works, and it shows, do yourself a favor, skip this and move onto his later writings, which are much more polished."
5,Best cyberpunk novel of the 90s,"This was the best cyberpunk novel of the 1990s. It is very well written, tremendously innovative, and incredibly entertaining. Neal Stephenson has found his own unique viewpoint on American culture, and the result is awesome. It is darkly humorous in places (the Deliverator is one of the best sub-characters in American fiction) and he leads you into a great deal of thought about the future of this country while remaining so enjoyable that you have to be dragged from the book to eat. I consider this to be one of the great books of the twentieth century, and have bought copies for several friends just to be able to discuss it with them."
5,Samurai Hacker Pizza Delivery,I really enjoyed this book. The vision of cyberspace is dated but well founded. The characters are very unique and interesting.
3,"Characters are great, sumerian story is okay...","I really enjoyed the characters, but I was bored with the explanations and there wasn't a very climactic ending. The descriptions lost me after awhile because they were boring and not descriptive. I should have read this book before I read Neuromancer--which was much better. Still a good quick read."
4,"Good, but not Gibson","Snow Crash is an excellent book. The first chapter is terribly funny tongue in cheek humor that sets the scene for a slightly more humorous look at the cyberpunk world than is offered by most authors. But the book does not continue like this. It progresses onwards, garnering a plot in the process. It does not possess the darkness that makes true cyberpunk (William Gibson) so great. Not to say that the book is not worth reading, but keep your expectations low."
4,Another great Stephenson book,"Great story. It jumps right in to the action, successfully intermingling the intro-type details into an action scene. Hiro Protagonist's Sumerian studies got a bit long in the tooth, but the cross-fades to Y.T.'s side of the story every now and then kept things rolling. I couldn't help but feel that the book was written with the intention of being easily converted into a movie -- unlike ""Cryptonomicon"" or ""Diamond Age"".This book is typical Stephenson: techno slant, good humor, lively characters, very granular descriptions of most everything. Unfortunately it also contains Stephenson's biggest flaw: the ending is way to short and very abrupt compaired to the flow of the rest of the book. He leaves issues unresolved and characters dangling. This must be deliberate, since he did the same thing with ""Cryptonomicon"", but it still gets to me a little bit."
5,A Bible for Cyberpunks,"My favorite book of all time. This is reminiscent of all that I dreamed of when I watched TRON over and over again in 4th grade... And Stephenson put it on to paper. This metaverse will exist--he is a visionary!That aside, the book is an exceptionally easy read. I enjoy it enough that I have purchased 6 copies of the book...I recommend it so highly that I give my copy away and buy a new one, just so that other people will get into it...."
2,Too cartoonish&#65533;,"Fun setting, but not much of a plot. The Sumerian undercurrents drag the action to a stop. But when there is action, it's full steam ahead, in the most implausible ways. For better cyberpunk, read William Gibson."
5,Loved it.,"I have to say I love this book. It isn't perfect. The writing can be a little disjointed/ADD sometimes. Still, this book's originality is astounding even after all these years. It brought concepts such as ""meme"", ""virtual reality"", ""online avatars"", ""corporate city-states"", ""religion as a virus"", ""hacking"" etc etc into the public imagination. It did so in a way that was entertaining, non-technical, and surprisingly human. A lot of sci-fi can be conceptually interesting but a chore to read. I often wonder if many mainstream sci-fi books were either written by someone with severe Asperger's syndrome or an AI...because the characters are so one-dimensional/uninteresting and the plot gets bogged down with elaborate technical details. Not so with this book...it moves at a quick pace, the characters make you laugh/cry, and the ideas are effectively communicated.Most importantly, I didn't want it to end."
1,Depends on how you like your SF......,"Snow Crash is full of fun and often inventive SF gadgets and ideas. How much you will enjoy this novel will depend upon how heavily you are 'into' science fiction and how plausible you like your stories. I found the characters somewhat lacking in complexity, and some of the plot devices contrived. Snow Crash felt to me a little like a comic book, without the illustrations. If you like your science fiction with an extra fantastical flare, Snow Crash is for you. If you're into hard-science SF and plausible story lines, there are many better options available."
4,Great book,"This book is funny and suspenseful, a great story, easy to read, and compelling characters. A must read for anyone."
4,"Cool concept ""Crash your brain""","This book introduces the concept that if you are exposedto the correct visual stimuli, your brain can crash -- i.e.become a vegatable, or mentally impared.This concept is plausable since we know that epelectic seizuresin children can be caused by video games.I enjoyed the characters, and the virtual worlds the book placed me in. I didn't give it a perfect 5, as I reserve thisfor works like the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, but Cryptomocrongets a 5 which is another of his books."
1,Snow Crash,"If you enjoy science fiction books, then knock yourself out, enjoy the book and move on with your life. I did not enjoy the book. I live a normal life and I do not find these types of books interesting. I only read it upon the recommendation of one of my friends-apparently we have different taste in literature. Other than being extremely confused with the book, I did find it helpful on those sleepless nights. If you like this kind of book, then I recommend it. If you do not like this type of book, move on in the reviews."
5,Snow Crash--Less Filling Tastes Great,"Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson is Cyberspace masterpiece. Moving with the swiftness of a pulp fiction detective story and more action than most Japanese Magna. Snow Crash stars Hiro Protaginist(Great name) a Cyberspae Samurai, spy and Mafioso Pizza Deliverator and his partner the thrahsing cyberpunk GRRL Y.T. as they try and stop a billionare from .... well to tell you would ruin the story. Also They go against one of Sci-Fi's up and coming Villians who has all the markings of a bond villan.with quirky characters Snow crash is a great read one i have read multple times.(P.S. if you get the chance download the AUDIBLE VERSION it bring the story to life."
3,"Fun at first, but plot fizzles","This is my first experience with Stephenson, and the first 50 pages had me grinning like a mental patient. The images come to life, the scenes are deftly described, and the Metaverse unfolds spectacularly before your eyes.But for all the flash and promise at the start, the plot is oddly and disappointingly weak. Utterly predictable and hopelessly cliched, the characters never develop, never show any motivation as to why they are doing what they do. Relationships are not explored past the superficial. The relationship between Hiro and Juanita and the reason he risks his life to go get her is explained off with a Sumerian myth. Ridiculous.This novel is a fun diversion, and entertaining for the first 100 pages. After that, you are on your own."
5,Read this.,"Read this book. Yah...I know...the description sounds dumb... who'd want to read a book about a pizza delivery guy? The pizza delivery thing is just a vehicle for Stephenson's commentary on commerce/customer service.Plenty of stuff in here for the computer geeks (like me).I learned quite a bit about linguistics, too."
1,Why is the editing so bad?,"This Kindle book contains numerous typographical errors which, for me, ruin the experience. What a disgrace. Every single night I read it, I spotted an obvious problem."
2,Not so great,"Whenever someone's output is described as a romp, that is natures way of saying ""don't touch""."
4,Biblical revisionism,"I listened to an audio version of this book. I enjoyed the plot, and the characters were ok. At times, the audio version was hard to follow. This was especially true of the parts pertaining to Sumerians and Judeo-Christian religion, which also didn't hold my interest when they got lengthy. The foundational concept of the book was based on revisionist interpretation of the Bible, which might bother some people."
5,"Blood, Sweat and Tears","A DVD that might make you feel sick, if you get sick from the sight of Blood of course.:)I'm not even going to bother with the match list; seeing how a bunch of users already gave they're thoughts, Impressions and ratings on them."
3,"Not True ECW Matches, Please Read","As many of you probably know, WWE has not purchased the rights to much of the music ECW used. Matches will likely be cut and there is a reason why Raven/New Jack aren't there. For totally uncut, old school ECW videos visit http://ecw666.cjb.net"
5,The Art of Watching FIlms -Book Review,"This was an amazing book, esp. because I was taking a film and literature class. It's readable; there aren't any big words that you can't understand just to make the text seem scholarly. The quality of the shipping was good. I got it the second week of class which was a good thing because usually when I order a book off of here I get it two weeks later and by that time I'd be three weeks behind in an 8 week course. All in all, it was a good experience."
5,Storytelling and Music at its best!,"The Celestial Navigations team has combined synthesized music and storytelling into a combination that leave me begging for more. The stories are deep and the music is powerful. If you can imagine stories like those on the Twilight Zone with modern day synthesizers playing in the background, then you begin to understand what Celestial Navigations is all about. These stories paint a very vivid picture and leave you thinking every time... Everyone should have a copy of this..."
5,A Great CD Single!,"I must say, I LOVE this song, a beautiful song set to beautiful music. What could be better? It make you want to cry, yet it makes you want to listen to it over and over, I can see why it has sold 4.5 million copies to date, WAY TO GO LeANN!!!"
3,"Woodcraft is camping, great narrative voice, images missing","I picked up this book hoping Woodcraft might have to do with carpentry or somehow building stuff from wood. It doesn't. Woodcraft means camping, which is also fun. I've only skimmed through the book, but I find the authors tone very conversational and compelling.Unfortunately, it seems the original book had plenty of illustrations that are not included in the Kindle free edition. The text discusses the missing illustrations a good deal.From my scan of this book, I think it would be inspirational before a camping vacation. It also seems to offer very reasonable advice regarding what items might be helpful and which are better left at home (or at the store).For those interested in camping or camping history, this is probably an interesting book. I really like the writing. Certainly some of the content will be dated."
4,Great book. Wrong version,"This is a great book. I own it in paper as well as the ebook. Unfortunately, the ebook available in the kindle store is the image-free version. The book, including images, is available from the Project Gutenberg Web site.This book is a fantastic book. Much of the information is dated, but it's still pertinent to camping today. Technology has changed, but the wood haven't changed THAT much."
5,Great educational movie for kids,"Great educational movies for kids. It is fun for the kids to watch, plus they learn facts about animals. I recommend this video for kids."
1,Iogear SD Card Reader is not working on the new macbook?,"I just got this SD card reader because my Macbook (new) does not have an SD card slot. Anyway, this product says it's completely compatible with both Macs and PCs. However, for some reason, whenever I try to transfer pictures or any data on my SD card to my computer, the thing stops working. It unmounts from my desktop and tells me that the disk has not been ejected properly. I tried disk utility repair, but it does the same thing when I try to repair it. Then my Mac tells me to reformat the disk - I have no idea what that even means, and whenever I try to access the disk or the information on it, it gets really temperamental and stops working. This thing sucks."
4,Fast,"I have a 13 in 1 card reader installed on my Dell and this little USB reader is about 1 1/2 to 2 times faster. I tested using a free software called 'HD Tach', which you can get off the net. Only complaint is that the caps could fit a little tighter."
4,Pretty compact USB drive,"Good product from IO gear. I bought this thing about a year (or more) ago prior to laptops having the SD card readers built in. Can transfer any type of info through the USB including photos, music, and documents. Not sure why it doesnt work on my work computer, other than that it works everywhere else. Not sure if it is SDHC compatiable."
1,Not worth the gamble,"I, too, am in the minority of users who have huge problems with this device freezing up during transfer and/or not being recognized by the computer.Given the disproportionate amount of glowing reviews, I'm left to wonder if this is due to some software configuration on my part (as well as that of other negative reviewers); but regardless, I wouldn't recommend taking the gamble. Before buying this product, I read the reviews, noticed that only 4 or 5 people gave negative reviews, and dismissed them as outliers. However, I'm wishing I hadn't; particularly since I bought three of them for friends/family."
5,This was great,Bought this to make use of all the spare SD cards I have around the house. It is fantastic. It fits in to my Laptop's USB port and all the computers at work. The largest card I have used was a 1.0 GB card. The speed of the card reader seems to be dependent on the quality on of the SD card.
3,Works most of the time...,"I bought this and found that it didn't work with my previous computer for some reason (probably because it was a dinosaur). I couldn't get the computer to recognize it as a drive. Also I get a warning about non-recognized software or something like that when I use it on my new computer, but at least it works now. It works, for the most part, but seems it could use some software improvements."
5,This movie was a scrumptious feast!,"At first I was taken aback by the bold imagery and seemingly out-of-place music. However, it didn't take long to become completely captivated with Harold Zidler and the Moulin Rouge. This movie has all the makings of a Shakesperian tragedy with a musical score that is surprisingly likeable and well-done. Bravo to the actors for both their marvelous acting AND singing on this Oscar-worthy film, as well as to Baz Lurhmann for bringing something innovative and downright infectious. A+!"
4,It's A Frustrating Flick,"There were a couple of times during ""Moulin Rouge"" when I wanted to get up and walk out. There were a couple of other times when I was almost moved to tears. That's the kind of movie ""Rouge"" is. It throws you for a huge loop. Take Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman (eye and ear candy), throw in some pop, rock and dance music, and add broad brushstrokes of color and rich sound. That's ""Moulin Rouge."" It's beautiful, vibrant, annoying, cheesy, bombastic, ecstatic, and uplifting all at the same time. And for that, it's definitely worth the price of admission -- and DVD. It's like nothing you've ever seen, and it gets my vote for most original film of the decade."
3,pleasantly surprised,"first off..i hate musicals..with a few exceptions..(hedwig, rocky horror a few others) but i got to say this movie drew me in from the opening titles..absolutely gorgeous visuals..the first hour blew me away. when the whole evil duke..hidden love..she dying act towards the end began rolling it lost some steam..but i still think this was a great movie..remaking the contemporary songs was a little bit gimmicky..but hey it really did work..especially ""heroes""...the sets, costumes, cinematography were all brilliant..i thought that this year lord of the rings was a shoo-in in the visuals dept at the oscars but now even though they are completely different styles moulin rouge might be just as good and might grab a few too..very simple plot but, made up for by the great performances...and a stunning look and feel. its nice to see some originality and someone with a vision..baz luhrman deftintely has that.and the extras on the dvd are wonderful."
3,Baz should watch more musicals,"In the commentary on this DVD, the director, Baz Luhrmann, says, ""We had to edit out much of the musical and dance sequences to advance the storyline,"". What he misunderstands is that most musicals have a very simple storyline, and that people enjoy them more for their music, dance, and overall style. By trimming these parts, he's left us with a bland, obvious story about forbidden love. Ho hum. Thankfully, the DVD has most of the musical sequences restored as part of the special features. If you appreciated the film's audacity despite its flaws, the DVD is certainly recommended, if only to know what could have been."
2,"Not opera, operetta","Or, A feast for the senseless.I read the headlines of a few newspaper reviews and they kept using 'operatic' to describes this silly film. But if you've been to an opera, you'd know that they are finer, more original works. So I'd suggest describing this flick as operettic: light, silly, and pretty chatty for a musical.As for it being excessive, I thought it was pretty tame. There were no big production numbers, just quick editing to give the effect of substance. Look at a Busby Berkley flick and compare the excess.Still don't get why Toulouse Lautrec was played like a giddy bozo. He was a well-borne and educated artist. He enjoyed a good time and putting on funny clothes for the cameras, but nothing this silly.One bonus: more garterbelts than Fredricks of Hollywood :)"
1,Maudlin Romp,"This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen - 70, 80 and 90's music in a Renaissance piece? Plus the story was depressing and stupid. Just shows how much Hollywood critics are out of touch with reality that they gave high honors to this film! Event the lumunous Nicole Kidman can't save this movie."
3,THE WHOLE IS LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS,"There are many outstanding moments in this jazzed up versionof the Moulin Rogue story but somehow the film as a whole left me unsatisfied. I had the feeling that it was just too ""Australian"" and that film musicals should be left up to Hollywood. These were supposed to be French characters, but they looked strictly Aussie.There is far too much fast cutting and almost subliminal editing in parts.Some of the sets seem kind of chintzy.Contrary to what many have said, I believe a major flaw was in the casting of Nichole Kidman as the ill-fated prostitute. She is just not believable to my mind."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"Terrible! I saw it in the movies and barely could stand until the end. Everything is exagerated, cliche and boring, the music is anoying (too much screaming), everything comes from a very bad taste.What a waste of time, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could use their talent for something better than this.Baz Luhrmann may score with the masses, but he is far away from being a good director, as we can see with his ""Australia"", also terrible."
2,Vacuous,"I know people who just can't understand why I hated this film. They just LOVED Moulin Rouge, where I literally cringed through it. I trudged on through the film in the hope that it would get better, but it never did. Sure, the dancing is big and that accounts for my 2 star rating, but I found the overall premise to be stupid. The pop culture inspired lyrics were especially annoying. As the Editorial above states, ""Nothing is original..."" Although that could be said of many films, it has never been more true than with Moulin Rouge. I apparently had difficulty redigesting the material that Moulin Rouge barfed onto the screen. ""Oh but it is so original by reweaving the lyrics and cultural references of the modern age into the context of turn of the century Paris."" Really? I just found this to be a vacuous waste of film."
1,junk!,"I am surprised by how this mediocre ""art"" was able to deceive so many people. What a shame! It should be an example of bad taste for young filmmakers..."
2,Moulin rouge,"It was basically a musical, and they broke out in song every 2 minutes. The way that they made everything fast and unreal just made it kind of creepy. The singing was ok but the story wasn't all that great because they told us what was going to happen at the end, in the beginning."
1,Can't Get Past The Music,"If you love music--and if you expect to be humming a new tune or two after seeing a musical--save yourself two hours and skip this film. I was so repulsed by the haphazard collage of contemporary music. If you closed your eyes, you'd swear you were listening to a B-grade (and very smarmy) lounge act. There is NOTHING original about the music, and aside from some extravagant visuals, NOTHING special about this movie. For a truly Oscar-worthy movie, try seeing 'Amelie'. And if you're looking for a ground-breaking, contemporary musical, check out 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch'."
1,The triumph of style over... just about everything else!,"Scary movie! The gushing reviews should be your warning...I thought it was going to be my kind of movie, but the only high-point was reached when the Fox intro was accompanied by a conductor with flailing arms in the first few seconds. It went steadily downhill from there. Good for a cinematography Oscar perhaps, but the movie was all-dressed-up with nowhere to go and nothing to say. God help us if this is the new musical style for the 21st Century."
4,Solid and intriguing.,"I admit, I picked up this movie because Nicole Kidman was in it. That said, I wasn't prepare for the elegance of the performances, which made her a moot point. Kidman's along with Ewan (way far from an Obi-Wan presario)chemistry lit up the screen and you can't help being drawn into the sometimes mythical atmosphere. The addition of an Elton John classic only heightened the power of Moulin Rouge. From the wardrobes to the songs, acting and choreography, the film achieved success. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a little overdone in parts, but I recommend you pick this up and let that little glitch be: a moot point. If you're a musical fan, a closet art-film fan, or just want to curl up for some good entertainment...get it.<P..."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"This is not a movie! It's a musical! Guy or girl, This movie is TERRIBLE! I had to force myself to finish it! Doesn't get ANY WORSE then this!"
1,Didn't like it all.,Being a fan of musicals this dissapointed me greatly the lack of a good script and songs made it sink to the level of badness it achieved. The performances were good but the faults were too strong to see the good factors of the movie. Not worth your time at all.
1,I hated it!!!!!!,"What is up with everybody saying how great this movie is. I sat in the front row with a friend and we couldnt stand it. It wasnt worth the money we paid to get in, much less our time even. I went to see it because it was getting raving reviews, and she wanted to see it. Well just giving you my review so maybe u can save yourself the time and money. There are so muhc better movies to see. Go see Oceans 11, Bandits or Pearl Harbor."
4,Second Time's the Charm,"Moulin Rouge. Originally, I would have told anyone who picked it up not to. My first viewing of it just didn't work out and I only made it halfway through before dubbing the entire thing much too abstract for me.Fast forward half a year, and I was bribed into watching the movie with a bunch of friends. Turns out, I fell in love with it. Try watching the movie a couple of times before you pass judgement on it... you might just be surprised."
5,"Finally, A Fun Movie for Adults","This was the forerunner of the current movie-musical craze. It's fabulous. John Leguizamo sucks, as usual, and I can't get next to Ewen McGregor doing Your Song as badly as he does, but these are small moments from an overall dazzling visual feast! Turn the lights out at home get the popcorn and prepare for the nonstop ride of your life!"
1,A frenzied noisy mess,"In this age of noise above subtlety and charm, this music video was a fitting touchstone. It is not a movie in the conventional sense but a jarring montage of fast moving glaring images and blaring sounds. It actually gave me a headache as I struggled through the first 10 minutes.If you are an afficionado of MTV and can endure seemingly random noise then this is the film for you, but alas not for me."
5,Really neat DVD,"The ""extras"" on this DVD are enough to force the switch from VHS to DVD. The ""green fairy"" / ""velvet curtain"" features where you can get little behind the scene mini-documentaries is fantastic.This movie is a rich tapestry of brain candy. The DVD reproduces it faithfully and provides so much extra info to help explain it and enjoy it further. One of the best DVDs I have seen."
2,a joke,"After seeing a costume layout of this movie in Vogue with Nicole, and being an artist, photographer, costume designer and lover of most anything French, I awaited this movie with great anticipation.Well, I hated it.It's dizzyingly fast paced flash+dash editing made me nauceous. Not one frame lasts long enough for my eyes to focus. The songs, many borrowed from other musicals, are presented in half people/ half animation form, and look ridiculous. It seemed like they couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be.The screenplay is based on the story of a real life dancer in Paris, but what is a real tragedy of life cut short is here turned into a comic travesty.The only good thing is that Nicole can actually sing, but her costar cannot.I walked out half-way through and asked for a refund."
1,Awful movie worst musical ever made,how anyone can like this it is beyond me no plot bad songs and awful performances make for one lousy movie don't bother with this junk.
2,Didn't do it for me,"Maybe I just didn't get it, but I lost interest after the first 5 minutes. The pan-in/pan-out technique was more irritating than anything else, I had no sympathy for any of the characters and could care less if they tried to bring the sound of music to 1890's Paris.Badly produced, excellent acting, maddening cinematography and a poor excuse for 2 hours of my time.Kidmann can find better uses for her talent than this."
3,I put off seeing this movie on the wide screen. Too bad.,"I rented the video. Moulon Rouge is a stunning riot of bits of songs, color, costumes & dancing, for the first half. The Sound of Music, the Beatles, Elton John (so many I lost count) come fast & furious in this circa 1890's Paris nightclub of the title. The ""can-can"" number was the highlight. Oh, the plot: just a tired old love triangle to justify the whole thing. Nicole Kidman enters my personal ""top two"" most beautiful movie heroines. Hookers just aren""t what they used to be."
5,The best movie of the year 2001...............,"When I saw this movie in the cinema I did not know what to think. The first half of the movie was just chaotic mixture of the past and the presence, but than it started to have a real action. The performance of Nicole Kidman is just excelent. This movie takes you out of reality to a different world of sadness, love and kitsch. It is a worth to see this movie, just to forget all daily problems, sit down and listen to the beautiful songs."
1,Worst movie ever made,"with awful singing and dancing and awful performances this is the worst movie ever made , Chicago is alot better , Forget this try hard musical."
1,this is not a film of great imagination,"Here is an example of a film that looks great but is a terrible mess. If you feel that elton john madonna et al need more residuals ($$) for their music, then perhaps you will like this film, but my husband and I watched half of it in great discomfort waiting for some kind of shift in its lack. We noticed so many problems with editing, script, song choices, and voice overs for all the songs we ceased to care about the beautiful sets, actors and costumes. We wanted it to be fun and waited for it to be fun, but ultimately felt that our tastes, senses and intelligence had been insulted. I can see that many many liked this spectacle, so I just wanted to add that I feel it may be the worst big budget film I have ever seen. I wish I could give it zero stars. This is not a successful musical in any way."
1,no thanks,"An odd hodge podge of unpleasantness. I left after 30 minutes. I went hoping to learn more about turn of the century Paris. Instead, I got Madonna."
3,it's all about love and light effects,"I liked the movie, but honestly I prefer Amelie.Nicole and Tom Cruise formed a good pair but I wanted tosee some french actors too.I was touched by the music especially that song of Elton JohnAlthough I like light effects and views from Paris andmagical 'infinite zooms' I think in Amelie they areexcessiveIf you want more effects you should go to the laser showat the Griffith Observatory of Los angeles (in renovationthese days unfortunately)."
1,Moulin Rouge...What a Diassappointment,Three words for this movie...I HATED IT!!! I bought this movie without seeing it cause my friend said I would LOVE it...so I took his advise. BIG MISTAKE....I couldn't even sit through the first 30 mins. I would have walked out of the theater had I seen it while it was there. Now my biggest problem is how to get rid of this aweful DVD and replace it with something I'll enjoy
1,"Weird, Doesn't Hold Interest","My wife and I lasted about 1/2 hour into this movie before turning it off. It's a story based in late 19th century Paris, and focuses on the Bohemian dance hall scene. Characters include Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and other historical figures. My problem with the movie is that the music is not contemporaneous to the time and place. The songs are modern, i.e., rock music, and this doesn't work well. Further, the lip-synching is poorly done. There are also fantasy-based special effects that seem out of place, such as a glittery fireworks display.If you are really open to this kind of thing, you might enjoy Moulin Rouge, but if you are expecting a historically accurate musical film, you'll be in for a not too pleasant surprise. I've talked to some other people who had the same reaction I did."
1,Fodder for the Addled Minded,"This is an example of totally inept filmmaking. However, impressionistic it is. My impression was that it was a good imitation of pseudo art-house fodder complete with affected acting and even less effective singing by its two stars. This is definitely not my parents' idea of a musical nor anyone else's of sound mind for that matter. To think that members of a certain organization even considered this film for any award belittles the very legitimacy of award giving in general."
1,Excruciatingly boring,"Movie: Absolutely boring and messy. Kidman is gorgeous, but does not save a film that was made for no apparent reasons.DVD: Good quality but does not save a film that's devoid of any content."
1,Truly an amazing...ly awful experience!,"I love musicals adore them infact , wanted to love this , IT IS NOT A MUSICAL ! its a bunch of poor old pop songs masking themselfs as classic musical songs. Nicole has an awful voice , Ewan can sing shame he had to land himself in such an awful movie."
1,Is This For Real?,"We rented the DVD of Moulin Rouge. I fell asleep during the first third, woke up, and decided to leave the room to do something more worthwhile. Grating high-pitched voices. Weird things going on that didn't make sense.Maybe I should give it another chance someday, and see if I change my mind. This happens once in a while with films that I hate."
2,my head will explode,"I give this two stars for some of the cinematography and the costumes. But in every other way this movie is a mess. Grossly overdone in the tradition of Natural Born Killers, a movie that gave new meaning to the cliche""sometimes less is more"". I did want to like this movie, but it was far too chaotic and bloated. Makes me wonder what the director is like in person. plus I was dissapointed that this was supposed to be a musical and very little of the music was original, mostly covers of pop music. The visuals though interesting at times jumped from one idea to another too quickly making me dizzy. The main characters were also a bit vapid, even for protagonists in a love story."
5,A Vortex of Brilliance!!,"From the second that the lights went out, I was pulled into this movie and it wouldn't let go. Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film. It's not only the best musical that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies. The comedy in this film is just so fast and off the wall I found myself laughing because I just didn't know what the heck was going on! The musical arrangements of modern popular songs was pure genius and the dances were out of this world. Everything about this film was perfect, from the little conductor directing the 20th Century Fox theme to the grainy spotlight of the memorial at the very end. After the movie ended, it took a minute and a half for people to start moving; it's just that hard-hitting. I walked out of this movie wide-eyed and breathless; if you only see one movie this summer at least see this one, you won't regret your decision."
5,Love This Move!,Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies. The music is fabulous and acting our superb! Nicole Kidman is delightful!
1,Horrible!!! Doesn't even deserve a star!,I agree you either love this or you absolutely hate it. I hate it. I love musicals ~ I grew up on Rodgers and Hammerstein. I had to force myself to watch this. I felt the music was terrible ~ I felt the singing wasn't great ~ I didn't feel that Nicole Kidman had a strong enough voice for the part. If I could have chosen zero stars that is what I would have picked. If you never see this you are not missing much.
5,The most Captivating film of 2001,"There aren't enough words I can use to describe this modern musical masterpiece. As a fan of musicals, I have not seen a movie so captivating, comical, whimsical, romantic, tragic, and overall...beautiful. It is a spectacular love story that we have all heard before but expressed in a way that we would have never imagined. None like I've ever seen before. Best of all, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman bless the film with their wonderful voices. Not everyone will feel the same way after watching this film, but this is a film that will stay in my heart forever."
2,"daring, entertaining and ultimately failing","I finally saw this after hearing so much both pro and con about it. I have friends who saw it 4 or 5 times the first week it came and and who raved about it, and friends who thought it was the stupidest movie they had ever seen. I have to give the director credit--this is nothing like any movie I have seen before--the idea is unique, the visuals are stunning, but it just doesn't hang together the way it should. Part of the reason is the ridiculously simplistic story line, but mostly I think it fails because the editing is poorly done. At no point in the film does the editor slow down long enough to let you really see anything, and the effect which is at first energizing and creative becomes annoying, and dizzying."
1,"Pretty video, good sound, lousy story","I had great expectations for the movie, but to be honest didn't have the patience to even watch it to the end.The tunes, while nice, don't fit the period.Just too much creative licence taken and the story, sigh, not worth watching for free, let alone buying it.I enjoy musicals, but this one was disjointed and the story line ... a waste of time."
1,Moulin Rouge,Two of us did not enjoy the movie at all. Came close to walking out on it. It did get better in the middle but I do not recommend this movie.
5,Moulin rough,"This was a gift for the granddaughter, loves it and it came in plenty of time to wrap and mail off"
4,Mother loved it.,My mother loved this. It was very entertaining and she loves the actors. IT was a litle different than she is use to but enjoyed.
1,a Big Screen Karoke that is out of Tune,watching this Movie had me looking all crazy.Poor Script Cheesy Music Video Vibe.Cliched in every way to Make you run out of the room.One of The Worst Films that I Have Ever Seen.nothing about it Appealed to Me at all.only the Like a Virgin ROutine had Me Laughing a Bit.in fact this is a Cool Spoof Comedy.Yeah that's it.Avoid this...at all Costs.
4,yay! i found it! i finally found it!,"i loved this movie so much. i have been searching for it for ever since i saw it when i was 13 at my grandparents house during christmas. now i found, u can bet anything that im going to get this movie no matter what. im so happy *squeel!* im going to go and buy it right now! *runs toward doors, forgets to open it and crashes head long into it* im okay!"
5,Genius,Baz Luhrmann is a musical genius. Redone versions of classic songs are phenominal and most entertaining. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are incredible vocalists with voices I could listen to all day.
1,Worst Musical Ever,"I find it hard to believe that people actually enjoyed this movie, and am glad that it only won Oscars for costumes and scenery. At the opening of the movie I hoped that it would be a mocking homage to the MTV generation, done in a very interesting style. I soon found out that the movie could not decide if it was the former, a stream of consciousness comedy bizarre, or a serious (albeit extremely trite) love story. Some people bill this as the genius of the movie, I see it as serving no larger artistic purpose, and thus merely distracting and frustrating. Add to this the facts that all of the music was stolen, not performed in ways that give integrity to the original artists, and the lead male vocals were horrible; spell an absolutely horrible cacophony of a movie. If this opens a new era of similar musicals, I'll be in the basement staring at the wall."
1,moulin rouge,This was one of the dumbest movies that I had to suffer through in years. Whoever directed this movie got into the same mushroom patch with the author Revelation in the NT.
1,Cacophonous Calamity.,"This film was so unbelievably annoying, I only made it half way through it before I had to restrain myself from smashing the television...followed by lots of aspirin. If this is the ""Musical For The New Millenium"", forget it! I'd rather watch ""Singing In The Rain"", ""Cabaret"", ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (how DARE Nicole Kidman sing that song!), ""A Star Is Born"", ""Top Hat"", ""On The Town"", ""West Side Story"", etc..etc...I would only recommend enduring this film if you're having company you don't really like and you want to get rid of them early, just pop it in. A visual feast that will leave you not only hungry, but wretching. HATED it!"
1,bad bad bad bad,babad bad bad bad d bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad d bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
4,Best Musical,"If you love musical, this is a must see movie. A bit too fast and confusing at some point. It's one of the best musical I've ever seen. I don't really like Nicole Kidman's movie but I love this one. Ewan McGregory sang so well. It's very entertaining."
5,Moulin Rouge,"One of the great musicals I've seen. A feast for the eyes and ears. An underworld where love is for sale and the poet falls in love in a tragic way and finds himself separated from his love. Very, very visual film that can not be missed!"
3,It Was Okay,"I liked it but then I didnt like it. I think the problem is that I saw Chicago before I saw this & it blew me away! I expected more from Moulin Rouge then it was. I still thought it ws good. It made me laugh & it made me cry. I love that one guy i forget his name but he has like a speech problem! He is so cool! Anyways Chicago is a much better musical than this, and if you want to see a classic musical see Chicago not Moulin Rouge"
2,Horrid!,"I really looked forward to seeing this -- and boy was I disappointed. A visual treat -- and the idea of quoting pop songs is cute. But it doesn't work. It's too sappy, trite, arch -- whatever. I couldn't sit still, it made me fidgety. Fact is, I got BORED! Next day, we saw Cabaret, with Joel Grey and Liza. Night and day! WOW!"
1,Moulin Rouge,This is the worst movie I have ever tried to watch . I could not take more than 30 mins. Nicole Kidman is wonderful and has talent and beauty and talent so if you must see this movie turn off the sound and look at her in the pause mode .
2,MIGRANE ROUGE? MORON ROUGE?,"Call it what you will MOULIN ROUGE is a complete waste of time and only suceeds in giving the viewer a splitting headache (have some asprin on standby, you'll need 'em). How this film was a multiple Oscar nominee with Best Actress and Best Picture among them I'll never know. Nicole Kidman overacts frenetically, as does the rest of the cast, though she has a good singing voice and she does look gorgeous throughout the movie. However MOULIN ROUGE rates 8/10 on the vidiot's ""Cringe Meter"". By the time you hear the rendition of Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN you'll be ready to break your TV set."
3,Not my cup of tea...,"The DVD and online video were both as described and nothing wrong with the quality or shipping, I just didnt like the film. I would describe it as very ""artsy"" and honestly...ridiculous. On the kind side, I'd call it a ""spectacle"" and leave it there."
1,Unwatchable,This movie was just plain unwatchable. We tried and tried but after 20 minutes turned it off. I am sure we would have walked out of the movie theater if we had seen it there. It was boring and to be honest just plain stupid. How this movie was even in the running for an Oscar......We usually keep all movies in our collection. This one we gave away and to be honest apologized to the person we gave it to.
2,Not that Great,"If you want to read about Wade Bourne bragging about where he's shot ducks, it's great. If you picked up the book for really good decoy stuff, not so good."
3,Bayard O'Sandy is now B.Sandy and he wrote a book,"I know Bayard O'Sandy now is B.Sandy, he authored a book called ""The Link"" the ISBN 978-1-60643-020-0. I investigated him here on Amazon to find his music. I know track 7 is in the book but I have not heard yet. But I have ordered here. I put my evaluation as neutral since I have not heard the CD yet. Check out the book, I liked it lot."
3,Wayfinder V7500 Compass Plus III,"Bought it in October, mostly for the compass. Once I put it in the middle of the windshield, the compass now works fine. The altimeter is kind of a joke - it recommends that you reset it each day. The barometer is amusing. The ""atomic"" clock did not automatically do the daylight savings time switch.Note: Today, 11/5/07, my Wayfinder tells me the date is 10/36. :)As of now the atomic clock always resets the clock to Mountain Standard Time - I live in Central and it's now daylight time. It does not deserve the three stars I gave it."
1,Seconds?,About half of these Sylvania bulbs burned out the instant they were screwed in. The remainder didn't even come close to lasting as specified here on Amazon. Avoid at all costs.
4,"Good quality, no shipping problems, stock up now!",I just got an order of 24 and everything was fine. I tried one out next to a GE Reveal bulb and it was pretty comparable light quality. Will be getting a few more before the govt shuts everything down.
5,"Great, Durable Made in U.S.A. bulbs","These bulbs are excellent! Buy 130v instead of 120v and they will last longer as little electrical spikes won't blow them. Also, they are made in the United States. Most bulbs are coming from China these days. Let's support domestic manufacturing."
4,The Mind Boggles,"A lot of people forgot Corey Hart existed after ""Sunglasses at Night."" I was not one of those people. In fact, I wasn't really aware of Hart until ""It Ain't Enough.""This was Hart's third album, and I think it's his best.He pulls off an Elvis song ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" and the finale, ""Blind Faith,"" if anyone is keeping score, cements his reputation as something more than a pretty-boy one-hit wonder.Corey Hart faithful will tell you ""Young Man Running"" is his best album, but my money is on this one. There's depth and emotion pop stars aren't allowed to show in public nowadays."
1,The usual bias against ISLAM,"The author like most ""Western"" writers just endlessly criticizes Islam throughout the book. What human-rights do the West have to criticize the practices and lifestyles of the East?. How about Jewish women in New York city who are so overly conservative and traditional that they have to shave off their heads after getting married? Why is there so much bigotry against the practices of Islam only? Very offensive book, the only purpose of it is to belittle Islam."
5,We've come to Praise Him,While it may not be inventive. It is spirit led and shows us that part-time Christain Musicians can lead His people to worship
3,Cute old movie,"Funny old movie, kept my daughter captivated the whole time. Not a peep, barely even moved and that's saying something... if you know my daughter!"
3,A visit to the past,I had enjoyed this as a child and thought that my grandbabies would too. The 2 yr old loved it and that was great. The older one not so much. However I was disappointed that there were no extras whatsoever.Babes in ToylandI just know that in the Disney vault somewhere there has to be more.
3,Corny But Classic,"Although quite corney in places, I cannot forget the thrill I had seeing this movie in the theater as a child. Considering the time it was filmed, Babes In Toyland had wonderful special effects and plenty of Disney charm. If you can stay with it up to the time the children actually enter Toyland (about half way through) you will find that the wait was worth it. I am dissappointed that this movie didn't become more popular, but with an all star cast including Ray Bolger(the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz) as a villain this time, Tommy Kirk and Annette Funnicello of the early Disney family and timeless Christmas music from the original stage version,Babes and Toyland should be an annual tradition alongside Its a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th St."
5,cd please,"I have this dvd and love it. Now if only disney did us the favor offinally putting all the wonderfull songs of this film on cd! I would buythat in an instant so I could enjoy the songs while walking to work, orhouse cleaning."
2,Resolution was poor,The resolution was grainy and really not worth watching.We eventually gave up and did something else with the kids.
5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!,"THis is excellent! The cast is almost the same as the film, plus there are songs that didn't make it to the film."
1,Good Book - Horrible Service,"I'm sure the book is fine, but DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM TRONI WENLIRUI. They took longer to ship than is reasonable, and when the package arrived it was filthy and packed in a clearly re-used envelope that did not protect the book. If I were Amazon, I'd block them from the site."
3,sports fan,"Nice workmanship. Wooden cabinet is beautifully made, but dart borad is not attached to cabinet. So, we still have not used it because it is difficult to hang."
3,Ain't No Makin' IT,"Book came fast. And in good shape.Warning: The F-Bomb is used over 100 times. So if you are sensitive to swearing, there is a lot of it."
4,Insightful and entertaining,"Story of how Rachel goes to live and work in Beijing and finds herself starring as a ""typical American woman"" in a successful Chinese sitcom. The book provides a realistic and insightful look into cultural differences and (mis)understandings between China and the West."
5,Thoughtful Compilation,"Compiled by Chris ""Rockers"" Wilson, this CD is a great demonstration of how Wilson understands Jamaican music. As a youth growing up in Kingston, he has always been drawn to the dymanic music and the message of the songs. The liner notes alone should make this compilation a requirement in any Reggae lover's musical library, filled as they are with insights into the times and point of view of the artists. So many reggae compilations are simply thrown together with no thought towards the mood or the message. Wilson continues to choose his reggae compilations with sensitivity and intelligence, giving all the Jamaican musical greats the recognition which is their due."
3,"godd songs, bad mix","I stumbled upon scared of chaka after buying a hopeless records compilation. needless to say they were the only thing worth listening to on that cd. they make great music, the melodies, song structures, and vocals are fantastic but as it shows on this album, the diy punk attitude keeps this album from sounding great. the vocals are buried under a chainsaw of a guitar tone, the drums sound like cardboard and the bass is non existant. i'll crank this in the car and sing along if i'm by myself but your friends hearing it for the first time might just think that your car stereo sucks. still, even with the bad mix, this album is worth every penny."
4,Good figurine,"The statuette fits in nicely with the other figurines in my creche and they display about the same texture, detail and colour. I am slightly disappointed in the material, though. It feels plasticy. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!,"I have absolutely no background with Indian music (other than an appreciation for George Harrison's sitar playing on Beatles tracks) but the second I heard the song 'Dus Bahane' during a dance workshop with Meera Varma, I was hooked! This CD is awesome! I have no clue what anyone is saying as the songs are in Hindi, but they are all great.....I can not help but get up and dance! It's modern dance/pop with an edge, so don't expect high-pitched voices or outdated-sounding rhythms.This CD hasen't left the player in my car yet! Love it!"
5,Amazing,"This cd was one of the best that I've heard in a while. This is definately worth spending on! You know you want it, go buy it!!!"
2,Becky can go to Shopping hell!,"Okay, I admit, it's my own fault. After the last Shopaholic book, I should have never gotten this one. I guess I'm a Shopaholic as well. I couldn't care less about Bex or anyone else in the plot (was there a plot?) They should stuff it all in their contrived Angel bag and be done with it. Please, no more, we can't take it!"
