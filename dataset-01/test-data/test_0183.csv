3,Ok,Never really used. We have hard water and it had to many small spots to get yucky. Threw out pretty quick. Was kind of hard to so it would rally help if they got to close.
3,Doesn't stay put!,"I bought this to help protect my child from hitting his head on the faucet. The water deflector part is cool but I can't get the darn thing to stay on the faucet very well. There are little grippy things that are supposed to hold it in place but if your child touches it or you bump it with your arm, it will come off."
4,Works well but...,I love the way it looks and it works pretty well except that I didn't realize I needed to have a spout that had the pull on it for rerouting the water. I ended up duck taping a screw to our spout so that it would fit right. My daughter does not use this to rinse her hair under yet but we're getting there.
3,Bubble bath didn't stay in the reservoir..,"The water flow was great and my daughter loves playing with it. The rubber/plastic material is soft enough to prevent injury, yet seems durable. It fit my faucet well and the bubble bath dispenser worked well. However, bubble bath that was stored in the reservoir would disappear over the next day or so, meaning it was leaking out when not in use."
2,"Great idea, falls off at the slightest touch","I bought this thinking that it would fit my standard sized spout, which has no shower diverter, and right away it seemed too big. My baby loves the waterfall that it makes, reaches up to grab the source, and easily pulls the thing off. I really wish it wasn't so easy to get off of there, because it is a great idea. Hope someone else has better luck, but don't buy it if you don't have the shower pull to secure it."
1,Never liked this cover,"This did not fit my faucet correctly - was constantly sliding off. That is, when my kids weren't taking it off to play with it. Plus, I didn't really feel that it was soft enough to really protect them if they did fall into it. Also, be warned that if you have well water and get some red iron staining, this product is nearly impossible to keep clean. Lots of nooks and crannies to collect soapy, scummy water. I bought the KidCo Bath cover, and threw this piece of junk in the trash. Good riddance!"
5,My girls love this!,"Wonderful I have a 2 and a 3 yr old and bath time was difficult up until tonight. They let me rinse them in the ""waterfall"" so no fighting to rise their hair or body and they loved playing in it! Wonderful!!"
1,Good thought but needs work,"This would be the perfect bath product except for a few flaws.1. It is meant to fit a range of faucets, however it does not clamp down tightly and is very easy for my children to pull off.2. The soap dispencer is a great idea but the soap residue is hard to get out after a few uses and the button sticks in the open position.It is nice and soft and helps block the kids from hitting their heads but I would like it not to fall off so easily."
2,Flo water deflector.,"If you have a shorter faucet, don't buy this item. It won't work properly, and the water will just spew out the side of it all over the floor."
4,"A few issues, but generally pretty good.","I bought this Flo for my 1-year old. I'd previously bought the frog bath organizer and liked the quality of it, so after reading some reviews, bought the Flo, as well. Out of the box, the Flo did not work well. For one thing, it refused to stay on my standard bath faucet. Big problem, obviously. But customer service was fantastic. The guy I spoke with stayed on the phone with me until we could engineer something to keep it on there. Eventually, we discovered that if you wrap a hand towel around the faucet, the Flo would stay on pretty well. That fix has worked for the last 3 months. One other issue wasa that the soap dispenser is not reliable. The soap leaks. So we don't use that feature. But as a faucet cover, water fall, and bath toy, it works great. Despite the minor issues, the value of customer service and general quality of the product still make it worth the price."
3,"Gets midewy very fast, and it's really hard to clean!","I bought this for our 2-y.o. daughter's bath time, and we loved it. It never occurred to us that the inside of it would collect mildew - but it does. And how. My husband scrubbed it in hot water for a long, long time and couldn't get the mildew out. I'm not sure how to handle it - should I spray it with alcohol every night to evaporate the water? Why should I even have to worry about this, it is a WATER tool, after all... Disappointed."
2,Hard plastic,"I was expecting something soft and rubbery which would help protect baby's head if he falls in the bath. But this is hard plastic. I couldn't figure out how it would really protect from anything. I guess it would help if you have your kids lean back to rinse their hair, this would allow them to sit further away from the faucet because of the waterfall spout. Also, although it's handy that the diverter is still functional, it's also a bit hazard sticking up that could hurt in a fall. I thought the protector came up higher around the diverter so that if you hit it, the head would stop at the protector and not reach the diverter. But that is not the case.I think it works as they intended; it fits our faucet, and the waterfall effect is sort of neat. Didn't try the bubble dispenser, that seems like more trouble than its worth.Just not what I was expecting, and doesn't work for us to provide the bath safety I was looking for."
4,fun fountain,"Though I agree this item has some flaws, overall we have been happy with it because our 15-month-old daughter is delighted with it! We do not have a 'shower switch' on our faucet, so the Flo does slide down a bit, but we don't have any problems with the fountain aspect working properly. Our daughter can pull it off, of course, if she wacks it really good, but it goes on and off so easily that it doesn't matter! I like that it looks somewhat cool and isn't a big duck that is difficult to get on and off. We have not used the bubble bath dispenser, so I can't speak to that. We'll see how it holds up over time...we've had it since our daughter's birth but have only been using it regularly the past few months, since she has decided she loves to take a bath. It also does work great for it's primary purpose, which is to keep our child from bumping her head on the tub spigot. We would probably recommend this item, with the advice that it does tend to slide around."
2,"Cool design, but has some kinks","I love the design/look of this, but we also had problems with soap leaking out. No real problem since we keep liquid soap in the bath anyway. The big problem was with it falling off. I contacted customer service and they were very helpful offering suggestions, though they did not offer a refund since it had been several months since the purchase. We are still using it and it is pretty stable after I wrapped a few rubber bands around the faucet (under the Boon Flo) and one around the back.I do not mind this setup, but find it disappointing to have to deal with it for a product at a higher price point. We are still using it more than 2 years after purchase though, since it does work with the modifications. If I'd spent less initially, I would have given it a higher rating even with the problems.I do enjoy the ""waterfall"" effect, though honestly I wish I'd just purchased a cheaper blowup/plastic cover to start."
1,Couldn't get what they don't make anymore,"Order this item from Ace Digital Club. They told me this item whas no longer available. They sent me two CF card, I ordered SD. The Kingston Technologies SD card was 133X speed. The Sandisk was 66X. I was E-mailed that they were sending me a replacement for the incorrect order but have not received as of this date, 8-5-2006. I have had the Kington Technologies 512 MB card in the past and it was nice for faster recovery from photo shoots."
2,"Correct diagnosis, naive prescriptions","This book has not aged well. Many of the problems Nelson has identified are now much worse than when he wrote, but the ""solutions"" seem both oversimplified and impractical. The only problem I know really well is the overuse of prison. Here Nelson proposes solutions that are both politically impractical and practically impossible. There are moving stories here and there which are well used to illustrate his points, but there is also gratuitous obscenity and celebrity bashing. Oh, and a complete absence of reference notes. I suspect this book was dictated rather than written. For the writing and remedies I was tempted to give the book a single star, but it is still worth looking at for the concise cataloging of what is currently wrong with the country, most notably a decline in spirit and increasing class polarization."
2,Disney is in there somewhere,"I have the first CD in this series, Heigh Ho Mozart, which I think is the better of the two. While listening to this CD, had I not known the songs were supposed to be Disney tunes, I believe I would think I was just listening to another classical music CD.Some of the songs are a bit recognizeable if you listen very, very carefully. Others almost completely obliterate the Disney part of the song save for a note or two. For example, the Ballad of Davy Crockett sounds nothing like the original song. The Siamese Cat song from Lady and the Tramp is even worse. I had to look at the liner notes to figure out what song I was listening to and even after identifying it, I had difficulty picking out the Disney notes.Overall, I would recommend Disney fans skip this unless you are die hard, but Heigh Ho Mozart is a better investment if you actually want to hear the Disney songs."
5,"Novel Enjoyment, Meaningful Perspective","Very enjoyable. Very intriguing. Most of the cards have some little twist -- other than the 180 change rotation in perspective -- like objects or people that are now in view and add and/or color the meaning of the classic RWS images.The artwork is clean, crisp. The drawings are both refreshingly new and rooted in the now-familiar Pamela Colman Smith imagery. There is a very close attention to detail present in the illustrations to ensure you can't mistake the corresponding RWS card, but likewise you can't help but appreciate the additional details now present in the different angle of view.Like the original Waite-Smith deck, at first I was intrigued, later I was engrossed. This was a very rewarding purchase and a prized addition to my collection of Tarot decks."
3,"Have seen, do not own","This is the Waite-Colman deck that should have been made instead of the Radiant and universal waite deck...except for God's sake turn the people around! It's the stand-out feature, and the one that I like the least. The over-all quality they seem to be oblivious to."
5,Original,"I've read a lot of fantasy/horror what ever you want to call it. If it has a vampire/were-animal/etc, I've read it. So many of them take an idea and give it a twist. Which is ok for the most part. Lynn Viehl truly came up with an original story line. It was good reading and hard to put down. I'm excited to have found a new author to add to my favorites!"
2,"""NOT A ROMANCENOVEL""",There is nothing worse then setting your appetite for a chocolate muffin and ending up with bran; that is just what this novel is bran. The Arthur has disguised her fantasy/horror novel as romance-it is not. I am so glad I checked the book out from the library instead of buying it.
4,great series,I liked the second book too. It has a lot of potential as a series. I look forward to getting to know more of the characters.
5,Exccellent Audio qualtiy,"First thing I noticed with this item is the great audio quality although i was using the same old speakers in my car. I originally got his item so I can connect it to iPod's adapter which works flawlessly although I would have loved to see a search feature added.Overall, this is a great model and I recommend it highly."
1,"Missing a necessary cable, wouldn't connect to my Meridian system","Without the special network cable, this is useless. I have returned it and purchased another. Hopefully this one will have all the necessary pieces in the box."
5,Great All in One Printer at a GREAT price,"Great Laser printer. Fax works well with good features. Copier with document feeder works very well. Scanner works well, but must use USB cable for scanner - not network capable. All other features are network ready. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this product just 18 months ago, and it has become completely inoperable on two separate occasions. First, there was an irremediable paper jam for which I had to send the product back to Canon. Then they sent me a replacement printer that broke down for no apparent reason - just decided to freeze one day. Also beware that this product has a strict one-year warranty that does not extend to replacement parts Canon sends. So despite the fact that their second product fell apart less than six months after receiving it, it is no longer covered by warranty."
2,Este libro es malo,"Note: The following review has been provided by my younger brother:I've been taking Spanish for 3 years and this is by far the worst Spanish book I've ever read. The comics are dull, the exercises feel more like time wasters than actual lessons, and overall this book has taught me little if anything. It doesn't even have a English into Spanish Dictionary and it doesn't teach me anything I'd use in Mexico. If you want to know how to conjugate a bunch of verbs and fall asleep while trying to complete homework then this is your book, if you want a book that teaches you phrases in Spanish, definitely look somewhere else."
5,Onward Manufacturing Company Non-Stick Flat Spit Rotisserie Grill...,Very well made and worked perfectly in our BBQ. I like how the thickness is adjustable to secure different size items to be BBQ'd. Easy to clean. It is a great product at a very fair price.
3,Knit Leg Warmers,"These leg warmers are a great length and very attractive, I purchased them hoping that the bottom would fit over the tops of my shoes, which they do nicely. Great color too. The only drawback is that they are a little scratchy against your skin, but I'm glad i made the purchase."
1,Poor design,I call this a frisbee switch because after six months of trying to get it to work properly I threw it out of the window. I took it to the shop and took it apart to see why it wouldn't work. It has an uncorrectable design flaw. It works by simply moving an internal optical cable from one port to the next. Simple enough. The problem is the gap between the ends of the cables it too large. The cables have to be lined up perfectly for it to work. The sockets on the switch fit so loosely it is not possible to maintain proper alignment and the signal cuts in and out. Don't waste your money.
5,Great little gizmo,"I bought this probably for the same reason many of you are considering it: a need to connect my PS3 and my HDTV to my home theater system which has only one DigAud input. Some of the reviewers have stated that it's kinda big...not a problem for me. So, for those of you who are interested, here's my connection list:PS3 Slim 120 GBLG LHT854 1000-Watt DVD Disc Home TheaterLG 32LH30 32-Inch 1080p LCD HDTVCables to Go 28734 Digital Audio Explorer Toslink Selector Switch3 Port Smart HDMI SwitchDish 722: HDMI to 32""LG HDTV and DigAud to Selector SwitchPS3 Slim: HDMI to HDMI Switch to 32""LG HDTV and DigAud to Selector SwitchLG Home Theater: HDMI to HDMI Switch to 32""LG HDTV:Everything works great so far."
1,Don't bother.....,"I bought this switch to select between my PS3 and Satellite Receiver digital audio outputs to my single home theatre digital audio input. I read the reviews warning about it not working, but my searching didn't find another solution so I tried it. Unfortunately this was a complete waste - the unit did not pass signals from either device. Both work fine when plugged in directly - which is what I will just manually need to do. Don't waste your time ordering this. Kudos to Amazon for a first class handling of the return and refund."
1,"Simple Idea, Poor Construction","I've been looking for a device like this for years. Multiple digital optical sound generating devices going into one sound system is a problem that I expect a lot of people have. I have to keep switching optical connections to get the best sound from each source--cable box and dvd player to sound system. I figured that someone must make such a switch. The first one of these I bought didn't work as an actual switch, though input 1 did work. Amazon sent me another one that didn't work at all, except for the sound popping in and out. I'm guessing that the construction is just too poor because the idea itself is simple. I'd be willing to pay quite a bit more for a product like this that really works."
1,Would not work,"Would not work unless I pulled the output cable slightly out of the switch, then it would not work if I turned the dial, returned this item.Very disappointed."
3,Problems with DVD quality,"I have ordered Korean Period Piece Drama series from Amazon before and the products arrive timely and most often in good condition. The Queen Seondeok series however, has had flaws in the DVDs in places making viewing for a couple of episodes rather uncomfortable and requiring intervention to fast forward. It makes ordering series a concern because a problem affects the volume since you cannot easily replace a bad DVD disc, at least not in a way that I know of."
2,Not as good as the Reebok Sweat Factory ...,"I also bought this because I loved the Reebok Sweat Factory video, but was pretty disappointed. I thought it was a great idea to have a salsa workout and it sounded like lots of fun. But the workout is not very intense and is pretty boring. The moves are more like variations on marching than actual salsa steps. Besides, the female instructor impresses me as acting stereotypically latina--almost like Charo. The only time she really seems human is when she says, ""Don't lock your knee out,"" during the stretching scenes (which are very short). She and the male instructor start flirting towards the end. It's not a pretty sight."
3,Not bad,"This workout frustrated me no end in the beginning because the instructors take no time to explain the complex dance moves they are doing - they just expect you to catch on right away. I finally had to stop the tape and do a couple sessions in slow motion to get the moves, which I thought was a waste of time. That said, once you have the moves, it is a lot of fun, although only a moderately intense workout. If you have a dance background, you'll probably like it. If not, be prepared for some practice work before you dive right in!"
5,My most comfortable casual shoe,"I had never tried Crocs until my sister spied a kiosk in the mall and told me I needed to try them on last year. I bought two pair, and the capri thongs I wear everywhere sandals are allowed. My feet don't even feel like I'm wearing shoes, and they give me such amazing support for standing still and walking. I lost them on a kayaking trip last month and could not find my size anywhere buy Amazon.com due to the lateness of the season. I was like a kid at Christmas when they arrived, and I was only without them for a week."
2,Too Narrow,"I personally think that these shoes are too narrow. There size chart isn't very good either. I first ordered the larger size, as the chart said, but they were way too big. Even when the length fit on the 2nd pair, they are just too narrow."
1,WEAK LYRICS ON BAILANDO,"WHO WROTE BAILANDO ? SOMEONE JUST SLAPPED SOME WORDS TOGETHER... WHAT A DISGRACE TO LATIN FREESTYLE. ALL SHE SAYS IS YEAH, YEAH, YEAH"
1,Great picture until it goes black,"Same problem that everybody else is reporting. I had one for about 3 months and it started blanking, so I returned it for another. This one has worked for about 6 months and it is now doing the same thing.Basically you turn it on, and within 5 minutes, the picture goes black. If you pull the plug and restart it, it'll come up again. The problem seems to be getting worse, as for a while it would only require 1 restart, and now it has been requiring 2 or 3.I did notice the 2nd one's test pattern is now yellow and blue, instead of white and black, which is apparently because of color streaks which would be all too visible on the original test pattern.This seems pretty dirty of Panasonic. On the plus side, the image is fantastic when it works."
4,"P-sonic extended the warranty by 6mos. Also, AX200U solves iris issue","Highly recommended for color, clarity, flexibility, and ease of use.Panasonic has extended the warranty on this model by 6 months (total of 1.5 years). Also, the PT-AX200U solves the iris problem if you want to buy that unit without the warranty hassle."
1,These are lemon projectors,Don't Buy!!!! Sent in for repair more than once. Now that the warrantee has expired the projector is dead. Google for tons of other problems that other people have had.
1,Bad Iris here,I am in the same boat as the others - bad iris. This product stinks and unfortunately I was taken.Now I will have to be shipping it around at my expense.This will be the last Panasonic product I buy.
1,You really do get what you pay for!,"I just received the adapter two days ago and thought it was the actual thing. The first clue that I was wrong was that the actual Dell AC adapter is heavier than this one. The bottom panel is different. Here's the problem I have: The 1st night it charged the laptop to my satisfaction and I unplugged it and wrapped it up but when I went to use my laptop again the adapter didn't work. There was no green indicator light, it wouldn't charge the laptop. Now I have to spend money to send it back. I don't want a replacement unless it's the actual Dell product. Might as well spend the money for the real thing. Sorry guys!"
3,It Came From Outer Space,It holds up in flat presentation. It was released in 3-D on VHS with red & blue glasses included. I found a copy in a closeout several years ago.
4,Sci Fi Fan,Richard Carlson may not have been the best actor in Hollywood but I have truly enjoyed him in many 50's Sci Fi movies. This is one of those movies I watch with other Sci Fi's for my evenings at home or rainy day movie day.
5,Wonderful Series,"Another smash hit from the BBC. It is just as addictive as ""Downton Abby"" or ""Upstairs Downstairs"". Believe me, you will love these characters just as much."
3,"Nice movie, but not as good as the first season.",Something about the filming and plot development was so poor compared to the first season. This seemed much more like a rushed job.
2,Illustrations the only saving grace,"This books makes me feel like the only reason it was published is because of the author's celebrity status. Perhaps it's a difference of values, but I would never let my four year old paint her toenails or sit in the car without a child seat. As well, the bit about swimming nude as a baby but not as a four year old strikes me as bizarre. My kids are perfectly happy to run around in our backyard in the buff whether it's just them or friends (boys or girls) are over. And, I'm sorry, but ""tickle torture"" is just plain, creepy.The illustrations are quite charming."
3,nail polish,Shipping and supplier communication was great. My issue is with the actual product. The color is not true. I was buying the same color title as I get at the nail salon..... this is much pinker and not a match.
5,"To understand the complexity of it all, this is a must-read.","There are no all-or-nothing solutions but, wow, this is such important stuff! Just read it and think about it even if you still conclude you have to reward and punish. Early life experiences are so powerfully shaping as he documents, and we are taught through mid career stage to figure out the reward system and work it. But life isn't going to be very kind in the future to people who don't understand collaboration, initiative, and simply knowing the difference between what you want and what someone else wants of you."
1,This book is dangerous,"While no one will argue that talking to people and working with them to understand their motivation is important, these positive points in this book are far outweighed by the negative ones. The author misrepresents the whole field of behavior therapy when he states that it can be boiled down to ""If you do this, then you get that"". He also misrepresents the research on the effects of reinforcement on creativity, performance, and intrinsic motivation. It is much more complex than he suggests and does not lead to the conclusions he makes. The really scary thing is that for some situations (such as children with aggressive and disruptive behaviors) behavior therapy works and works better than anything else. Yet, after reading this book, parents and teachers might not even consider this approach, causing themselves and the children they care about continuing grief. I wish someone would write a good critique of this book to help set the record straight, but I haven't found one."
4,A very different kind of horror movie......,"How this movie escaped me the first time around, I'll never know, but when I had finally seen it, I was very much entertained. Not exactly a ""B"" movie, this movie has a sort of comedic situation set up that seems to intertwined with a horror situation connected by one thing: Micheal J Fox. The acting here isn't bad at all, with some great actors/actresses. MJ Fox is pretty damn good in this, something I haven't seen since Back To The Future. Dee Wallace Stone is pretty good as well, making it hard to believe that this was also Eliot's mother in E.T. There are quite a few other good perfomances in this, as well as a greatly welcomed, well done, yet creepy appearance by Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame. The story line is quite good, maybe predictable, maybe not, but worth the watch either way."
4,Pre-Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson directed this....,"Pre-Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson directed this special effects-laden thriller-comedy starring Michael J. Fox as a con artist who fakes poltergeist attacks with his two dead buddies. Imaginative and funny at times, The Frighteners is a fantastic film with some creepy FX. Michael J. Fox is great as conman Frank Bannister, and the suppourting cast are as excellent as they are eccentric. Also director Jackson shows what a good sport he is with a well-done cameo.The main villian, the 'soul collector' (who goes around offing people with a creepy modus operandi) is remarkably similar to the ringwaiths in LOTR. The score is suitably spooky, fitting in well with the tone. The film is not for everyone however, there are some very chilling moments that may not sit too well with the added humour for some audiences. But hey, it's fun, and really entertaining. A fascinating and off-beat film from the director of Lord of the Rings."
5,the frightners,I purchased this dvd because my vhs tape finally went bad. It was the best price i could find. am very happy with the product and service.
4,Great Book,"I ordered this book to learn more about quaker parrots.I really learned alot and the the book was easy to understand. It has really good information, especially on what to feed them and what kind of other stuff that they need . I would really recommend this book to someone who wants to learn about quaker parrots."
4,Covers a wide variety of subjects,"Alot of information from choosing the right parrot, taking care of it, training, and health. Very helpful."
5,Good Album,"This isn't the album people that only bought the self-titled are gonna like. There's really only one really catchy song (Prison Bound), which is a good song, but a lot of the other songs are much better. This album is for the real Social Distortion fans."
3,Enjoy the sweetness.,"The pieces in this album are sweet and sentimental. It is not necessary to concentrate hard to enjoy them, although their density of sounds would satisfy those who attentively listen to them. If you like soul music, you will probably be pleased with this album. Especially the vocals in Y LLORE are full of sentiments. By the way, SI A UNA MAMITA is a good example of the conversion of Rumba Guaguanco into the popular music."
2,Not What You Hear On NPR,"Be warned that this book does *not* contain the type of fun that you will hear on their NPR show. Good or bad, this is a collection of their personal pets and peeves and has nothing to do with car repair, their radio show, or humor. This book is a collection of vents and rants against everything from people who drive too fast, people who drive too slow, the educational system and other topical subjects. As a longtime fan I was disappointed because I expected something along the lines of ""Women Are From Ford, Men are from GM""-type humor. Want rants and raves? Check out Ed Anger's ""Let's Pave The Stupid Rainforests & Give School Teachers Stun Guns."""
1,Terrible,This was the worst thing I have ever bought. It was so cheap. The first day I got it I took out the sizzors and they dont even cut paper. The little pin holder is just two fuzzy balls glued together. My caddy doesn't even hold the tins it came with. It broke when i opened it and now they will not go back on. The thread is on a paper and you don't get enough to do anything. I was extreamly disappointed in this product. DO NOT buy this product. It is a waste of money.
5,Hip-Hop at its most demented...Superbly done masterpiece!,"Kool Keith has returned as the deranged and psychotic Dr. Dooom after destroying his other alter ego, Dr. Octagon. No doubt this is his most off-the-wall, wacky, insane album to date, and also his best. It is hard to follow up an album such as Dr. Octagon, but it has been done. Maybe people should anger him more often, for he has vented it in such a manner that the material has homogenized into an automatic classic! He's mad, and he's bad! Oh my goodness... Check out the hidden track after ""Live"". You have to wait until the time reads about 5:10, and it will come on. The song is entitled, ""Bald Headed Girl"", Every track, including the hidden one, makes it worth every penny!"
5,Kool keith's dr. dooom persona is keith at his best.,"Ultramagnetic front man Kool keith has finally created a perfect album. Many hesistate to compare this with Dr. Octagon, but I won't this Dr. Dooom is better, but different. Consider Dr. Dooom a funked out ghetto Dr. Octagon. Songs like Mental Case, Welfare love, Call the Cops, and Housing Authority are better than any thing out by any mainstream M.C. This also lets you know who taught Eminem his style, Rhythm X, KOOL KEITH."
3,better than Octagon?,"I know people will be angered by this, but after hearing this album I found it to be better (but not more groundbreaking) than Octagon. The beats are phatter I think, and Keith seems to rhyme more fluid (his offbeat opening on ""Live"" is genius). It's not the best stuff out there, but a great change of pace. I love the clowning of the No Limit covers, Chris Rock (and I'm sure many others) followed suit but Keith was the first that I could see. Rap as a whole has been going downhill since '92 or so, but this is a great exception."
4,Not a bad album,"Kool Keith is an amazing rapper. A little bit crazy, but a super MC. Unfortunately, the beats are not impressive. That is the only down fall to this album. But, Kool Keith is pretty funny: dissing pretty-boy rappers who sound more like R&B than hip hop."
3,New technology sold using last century's marketing,"I like the machine overall but I cannot escape the feeling that it is going to come up snake eyes for me one day. I can't say why, it makes decent images, although a bit slow on bitmapped images and PDF's. Ink refills are a bit tricky too. There are the 20 buck jobs (with a considerablely less ink in them) and the 58 dollar one. Go figure, I can buy a complete new machine for that kind of money and STILL get two cartridges (black and color).All in all a decent machine but the marketing is straight out of the early 20th century and King Gillette's scheme of giving away the razor to get you to buy the blades. All of the brilliance of this machine is in the ink cartridge and not the plastic of its body. For occasional users on a budget with no particularly great demand for speed, this is the one. Think of it as buying your print quality as you go, but remember it is a high price to pay for a cheap printer.DubleDeuce"
4,Very enjoyable,"My 15 month old son enjoys when we sing them together! It has helped my husband learn some Spanish too! I do agree that it is a bit confusing to have each song part English then part Spanish. I imagine that for a child who is learning languages, it may create confusion. However, since many people speak languages this way, I don't think it merits throwing this great CD away."
3,Not bad but not great,"One of the cons of this movie is its running time. Though at just under 2 hours it is not excessively long, the dramatic and over-the-top atmosphere makes viewing a somewhat heavy and tiresome experience. Jeff Bridges is good and Tim Robbins is brilliant. The plot is interesting and the climax somewhat disturbing. On the whole this is not a bad film, but it is a little slow, overly theatrical and lacks the spunk of an out-an-out thriller."
4,Arlington Road,This movie grabs you from the beginning and only grips you tighter. by the end i felt out of control. Great movie overall.
4,Chilling!!,"Everyone else has said this is a really good move. It will leave you chilled, but they did it so well, you won't mind that your mind has been shocked. See it!"
1,Should be rated worst movie of the year.,"I've never written a review, but after seeing this movie, I just had to say something about it. This movie attracted me, because I live in the DC area.Robbins, Bridges and Cusack are all wonderful actors. Robbins acting abilities were great in this film, Bridges is a bit on the wooden side and Joan was wasted since her part is a small one. You see her quite a bit, but the part was minimal compared to the guys.I kept looking for the character to sympathize with in this movie and there just wasn't one. I didn't like any of them. The photograpy was really bad with a forties feel to it with cheap horror movie shots. The plot would have been a decent plot had the writer presented it with a better story line.As a rental, at least you are only out a small amount. I do not recommend this movie to anyone for purchase."
2,Disappointing,"My review may be tainted by my distaste for Jeff Bridges, but his presence throughout this movie is a real downer. The man is a ham, an eye-sore. This performance is typical of his recent work. Robbins, on the other hand, is brilliant as always. Cusack an excellent supporting actress as well. The plot is OK, the cinematography fine. You get a little lost, but then again you are supposed to I guess. The ending is not storybook, which is a welcome change to most of the garbage that we see these days. However, it is entirely implausible. And for a master plan to hinge on so many variables takes away from the overall movie. However, if this was Harrison Ford playing the sad paranoid, with many of the easily discardable scenes cut out, this movie could have been far more digestible."
3,Good transfer of a taut thriller,"This review is for those who are simply interested in knowing whether the blu-ray transfer is a good one. It is quite good. While this is not a movie with a great deal of scenic vistas or special effects, the colors are strong, and the details are crisp. The sound was fine as well (again, for this type of movie). I had not planned to upgrade this title from DVD to blu-ray, but I found a good deal that made it worth it. My rating of 3 stars is for the movie overall; if I were only to rate the transfer, it would be a solid 4 stars."
3,"Watchable, but not great","The premise of ""Arlington Road"" is pretty good. The neighbors seem suspicious, but surely they are not really involved in terrorist activity...or are they? The problem is that you are bludgeoned with the probable answer throughout the movie. However, there turns out to be a little bit more to it than that, and I must admit, I didn't see the final twist until the very end (but my husband saw it coming almost from the beginning).My biggest complaint is that most things are too obvious and predictable, and Jeff Bridges's character constantly does stuff that doesn't make sense. In fact, there were many points that challenge reality, and that really detracts from the enjoyability of a movie.However, if you can ignore that, it's a watchable movie, and it might even make you think a little bit."
5,Cliffhanger,"There is never a dull moment in this movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. After watching on TV, I purchased Arlington Road as a gift. Love this movie and the ending is very intriguing."
1,"Masochistic, horrible movie. Unfortunately, well done","Insecurity for the sake of it coupled with the message that humans are deeply evil. If you evocate the best qualities in a human been you get his best behaviour, while making leverage on his weaknesses you pull his worst parts out of him. It's like biting your own testicles"
4,What an Ending!,"I know that most reviews here talk about the ending to this movie but it can't be denied. I was surprised by it. The movie even though it has great performances by Bridges and Robins, Bridges character makes to many assumptions at parts. The movie is slow to start(except the first couple of minutes) but once it gets going it doesn't stop until the ending. I did like the movie a lot but I would recomend renting the movie first so you can judge for yourself."
5,Great movie,Great movie. Was recommended by our son in law and we were glad we watched it. Good plot. thank you
5,Enjoying this cookbook,"While on a bike ride around Lake Tahoe, a friend suffered a heart attack. He was only 43 and in great shape. Needless to say, his experience was a wake-up call. My wife & I have tried several of the recipes since getting the book recently and have been very impressed with the recipes. They are easy to follow, and the dishes have a lot of flavor."
1,Bland!,"The recipes in this book may be healthy, but they are horribly bland. I bought this cookbook hoping to eat a healthier diet, but after trying a few meals, it ended up collecting dust on my shelf. There is no reason healthy cooking should lack flavor."
1,I'd rather die than use this book,"I'd rather die of a heart attack than cook from this book! I bought it for my husband because he has high colesterol, but every recipe we tried was lacking in flavor. The Southwestern Ratatouille was bland, and other recipes didn't fare any better. The recipe titles are tantalizing, but fail to deliver flavor."
2,possibly of interest...,"I would think these two films would be pretty much required for Asia Argento fans. More so Scarlett Diva, it being written and directed by Argento. Actually, Asia doesn't really play the main role in Love Bites. I doubt either of these films will really be remembered for anything in particular, however, Asia Argento is one to watch out for... but back to the item, the transfers are acceptable and there are a couple of extra features here and there....however if you aren't a spooky kooky or a rivethead and also aren't interested in Asia or Italian female directors i wouldn't think you would want to bother...."
4,Classic South Sh-t,"this cd is a classic. its in constant rotation in my car cuz damn near every song bumps. my favorite jams are BIRDIES THAT DONT CHIRP, TWO GLOCKS TWO HOES, THE SOUTH, CROOKED STREETS, SWANGIN AND BANGIN' SCREWED. those are just the ones I can think of, but they're all tight. if you like ESG or Southside rap, you need this cd. its underrated compared to SAILIN DA SOUTH, but its a ride-bangah."
2,"A great book, but a pretty bad movie..","This Chricton classic was wonderful in it's book form, but I'm sorry to say, is horrible in it's movie form. Maybe it was too complex a subject for it's day, or maybe it got unjustly thrown into the 70's sci-fi mold... who knows.. but to be sure, this film is both boring and unbelievable (in a bad way)! I highly recommend the book (which I read in a day!) but I'd say that the DVD is not worth the time it takes to watch (which is far too much) or the money it takes to buy."
3,a decent way to pass time,"Not exactly the best movie of all-time or anything, just a passable alien/scientist flick. It didn't go down as a classic because it's quite old but I won't really say that's a bad thing because it does keep you interested enough to watch through it once."
4,Excellent movie marred by a horrible transfer or print,"Intelligent, taught, suspense thriller that I saw in the theatre when it was first released. All of the technical goo in the picture is somewhat dated by today's standards, but if you keep the age of the film in mind while watching, you'll be more forgiving. The fact that most of the equipment used in the production was real also adds to the viewing experience.I do have a major complaint with this DVD though. This transfer has to be the worst I've ever seen, Laserdisc or DVD (though the film never made it to Laser). Maybe it's a good transfer of the worst print I've ever seen. Either way, the viewing pleasure is diminished because of it. I understood that Robert Wise was emulating a pseudo-documentary style, but even the worst government documentary I've ever seen wasn't this grainy. If there's a reason for the grain that anyone knows of, please fill me in."
4,Crichton Classic,"Michael Crichton's book was great and the movie was very well done back in the 70s. Now considering when it was made you will still find it drawing you into the drama. It is about an alien biological growth that may wipe out the planet if it is not contained. It is first discovered in a space capsule that landed in a small town where everyone but a baby and an old man died. They take it to an underground lab to study what is killing people. If you like movies like ""Outbreak"", you will find it well worth seeing. This will be out on DVD 4/1/03, no fooling."
5,One premise overlooked in reviews,"I agree with many folks here that this is a great film with a gripping screenplay. One premise that is overlooked by those who mention that it is ""dated"" is that the story itself is set in the 1970s and what is called the ""wildfire"" event is hushed up - making the movie even more chilling and therefore always ""up to date"" for its time."
1,I waited over a month and had to purchase the book elsewhere after paying through Amazon,I waited over a month and had to purchase the book elsewhere after paying through Amazon. I went on my boat trip without the book and still don't know if it has arrived at my house yet.
2,microscopic print,"Well, the print is not quite that small but hard to read. I couldn't understand why they used such a small font when they had plenty of room to use a more readable size. I would not buy a similar publication like this again"
5,NOAA Chart No. 1,The best darn little booklet you can get if you are interested in any way with nautical charts. It is a MUST if you want to learn/do marine navigation.
4,An experimental sentimentalism,"The songs in this album are as experimental as the pieces in Volume 1 and 2 of this collection, and more sentimental than the tunes in Volume 3. In other words, they became more sophisticated in the field of popular music.Los Van Van lovers, in this album you can enjoy the syncopated groove of the bass and the lyrical improvisation of the flute. In addition, a creative use of the synthesizer is shown."
4,Moveis of the 60s,"Another lush picture book that fits with the others in the series. It's just as one would expect, extremely impressive visually. Odd omissions, here and there (but that's true of the entire series.) Generally, an excellent volume."
5,"Honest description, good book.",The description of the book was honest and it was a great deal for a great book! I spent $0.01 on the book and then $3.99 on shipping for a great price.
5,near cult classic,"The following viewer is sooo right: Blood Lake brought me to tears as well. Well, actually, I laughed till I cried.The movie looks as if it was shot on daddy's 8mm camera. All expense was spared, and there may have been no actual script. Certainly there was no dialogue coach.In between murders, the sexy teenagers go swimming and run around in bathing suits. Benefits are two-fold: a savings wardrobe-wise and delightful eye-candy. The girls are perky and the boys are built -- beautiful to watch as they cavort and get scared.They may have double-digit IQ's, but they're geniuses from the neck down."
1,Better than Hatebreed?!,"Whoever said this band is better than Hatebreed is way off. These herbs don't even come close. Don't waste your money. Jersey has the worst ""hardcore"" bands ever."
3,Global Pressed,"Nice Album, but too hard I guess :) More hard than the 1st part V1 - Plastic music, pumped up beat... techno in it's own way. For those who want to break up head.. u see :) Besides I prefer nice house with progressive tunes, nice vocals & good beat... So not hi-rated but quality release - listen & enjoy... Be good. Respect :)"
4,Music of the Night,"I purchased Music of the Night as a Christmas gift for my eighteen year old granddaughter. She has not read it yet, and neither have I. So, I am unable to review this product."
1,Misleading Commercial Interest,Many have gotten the idea that these authors support the idea of unschooling. Nothing could be further from the truth and their true motives have recently been revealed in their push for more regulations on homeschoolers.
4,stick with the original soundtrack,"I love the music, but I wish I'd bought the original soundtrack instead of the anniversary edition, which is really for hardcore fans. Why would I want to listen to two slightly different versions of ""Freddie's Dead"" and ""Superfly"" on the same CD? Not worth the extra money."
5,"Not ""nearly perfect"". Perfect.","There are a bare handful of records that bear repeated listening, that are great from the first note to the last. This is one of them.It's all been said before: genius, classic, visionary, not a single wasted note, etc. Believe it.For vinyl fans, the Rhino reissue, remastered from the original analog tapes, is very, very nice. I went through several copies of the original, and as sometimes happened back then, none of them sounded so hot. This one is what the original should have sounded like, I think.Make sure you get the Rhino release; there is another reissue out there that was probably mastered from a digital source."
5,Part of the holy trinity of 70's funk soundtracks,"Car Wash, Shaft and this. That's all you need. There's more great funk out there (James Brown (of course), Funkadelic/Parliament, the Meters, the Temptations, early Kool and the Gang), but as far as soundtracks go these 3 are the bomb. Oh, I suppose I really should add the Saturday Night Fever OST to the list. So, the holy foresome, then."
3,Not enough texture,"This was an interesting read. I would like to have given it 3.5 stars. That seems like the appropriate rating. The plot was well done. It didn't bog down at any point. But, as the title of this review says, it seemed to lack texture somehow. Its presentation of 1926 Shanghai was believable enough, certainly to someone like me with only scant stereotypical expectations. But I didn't feel like there had been enough detail presented of life for Field and others around him. I almost feel as though some people and things utterly incongruous to the story, some laughter, jokes, etc would have helped."
5,Amazing album,"This is a great album. These guys started out as a punk band, but this record was a fusion of metal and punk. This is one of my favourite records of all time, it's that good.Never heard much from them after this record though.The rythymn guitarist now plays in Velvet Revolver."
1,Not very instructive on the specifics of creating a good model,"This book does a good job of giving the reader an idea of the potential of modeling, but it reads like the US tax code. After a while it is numbing. There must be a better way to teach these concepts to humans."
2,Don't believe the hype,"2 stars because Wray, at his best, can turn a phrase, and for his willingness to take on a big theme instead of some cyberpunk Gen-X treacly little story about skinny people in Manhattan having rotten relationshiops; docked three stars because 1) the characters are as flat as roofing tin; 2) the plot, as another astute reader noted, is conspicuous in its absence and oh so obvious when it does appear (a child born of an incestuous relationship -- I wish we'd declare a moratorium on incest) and 3) the structure -- a ""now"" in 1938 Austria, told in 3rd person, and ita;licized flashbacks in first person of the hero's deserting the Austrian Army and ending up in Ukraine during the great famine. One follows another as sure as night follows day, and after two or three, it gets really, really tiresome.Still, Wray should be commended for taking on such a large, and important theme. With a little more practice, he could turn into one heck of a writer."
5,Bona-fide Stunner!,"I got this book as a gift from a colleague I don't know particularly well, and began reading it without any great expectations. As soon as I finished it I felt I had to review it somewhere, because a novel this gripping and graceful doesn't come along very often. I was blown out of the water by this brilliant literary thriller! It's sexy, it's romantic, and it has the seed in it of truly timeless art and thinking. Like the best of Hemingway (who this young author could be the reincarnation of) the book even wears its flaws like bloody badges of honor. A novel of this caliber, that brings a forgotten time back to screaming life and makes that time and the lives, loves and fears of the people who lived it more real to the reader than his own time and place, achieves greatness. Reading this novel is like taking a bath in the ocean after six weeks of travelling across the dryest desert. In other words, true delight."
4,"Good, for the most part","It's good. It's simple and easy to use, but if you take a lot of photos with flash, the charge time gets slow real fast. Keep spare batteries on you. I like that it's not huge or heavy but works well for amateurs."
5,top notch,"Great product, would highly recommend.They're made from quality ingredients... don't see a bunch of chemicals in there which is reassuring. They smell great and moisturize very well. They're made in the U.S.A...such a difficult thing to find sometimes. They're a win all around, can't think of any drawbacks."
5,Moonheart,"I thought this book was excellent! It started off kind of slow. But after a while, especially the second half, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and some of the expressions that they make are sort of silly but I thought the overall story was interesting and entertaining. This was my first DeLint book, and the first fiction book that I had read in years, and I am glad that I started here. I am looking forward to reading more DeLint books."
2,"Crispin ""Not Funny"" Glover","This Crispin Glover is too boring and conventional for my tastes. He's like Bob Hope for the new millennium. I would like some edginess with my comedy, Mr. Glover!! I was sure he would resort to knock-knock jokes at some point. I can no longer stomach the shenanigans of this two-bit jokester."
3,Korea - The Untold Story of the War,"This is an excellent academic period study. Sadly, the author allows his all to transparent personal dislike of General MacArthur to shine throughout the book, especially in the latter chapters. However, as one who was there in GHQ under MacArthur, the book does confirm, at least for me, my long held personal opinion that the State Department, plus Marsrhall and Bradley were extremely jealous of the General for all that he had accomplished during the war and later in Japan. They finally got rid of him and the first thing they did was try to remove all traces of him. For example, we were instructed to remove the GHQ shoulder insignia;' they got rid of it immediately upon his departure and changed our name from GHQ FEC to USAFFE."
5,Maddeningly human & insanely unique,"This band is incredible.If any of you ever comes across this cd, I highly recommend it's purchase. I guarantee it will be beyond anything in the scope of what you are accustomed. Every track is unique, and each one contains incredible beats and hypnotically potent rhythm. Many of the instruments used are unknown to myself, but the tones are upbeat and wild. I have never ever heard anything similar to this band in my life, and trust me on this, if you are somehow lucky enough to find this cd somewhere, do yourself a favor and purchase Mong Hang"
5,All of Chante Moore's albums are the bomb!,I am so happy Chante Moore has a new album to be released. I love her soft voice and she is telling it like it is. There are some good men out there and not all of them are dogs. Every time I listen to that song I get very excited. I can't wait to the single is released. I am definitely going to buy the album. Nicki
5,This is the best lotion for your face I have ever used!,"I have been on a Murad skincare regimen for over two years now, and it is the best stuff I have ever used. This lotion makes your skin very soft. I highly recommend it. This was my first time ordering it through Amazon, and I recieved it two days early! Great service and shipping speed."
3,"Wamsutta Cotton Flannel King Duvet Cover, Blush","I recently pruchased a duvet cover in blush. The color wasen't what I had expected and I notified the seller of my decision to return it. There response was that if the item was opened it could not be returned. Well, of course I had opened the duvet package to spread it on the bed so I could see what it looked like in my room. Well, now I am very leary of purchasing over the inernet. The companys original advertisement was returns were not a problem, no small print concerning not opening the package, and now that I want to return the duvet, their hospitality sure has changed. The duvet itself is wonderful, so soft and warm and snuggly! The color, not so hot. The blush color is hard to tell from white actually. My original plan was a soft pink and brown..."
1,"TAGs are great, just don't buy from Amazon","Ordered watch for my wife. Watch was not running. Probably dead battery. It also looked like it had been worn for some period of time before. Requested replacement online, but no paid shipping label -- have to ship and insure yourself even though defective. Used the Amazon contact/call feature but because of the price, no one wants to deal with this. I was told to send the watch back using the label generated by Amazon that did not include postage or insurance and then call back to get reimbursed for the postage. They weren't sure whether Amazon would reimburse the shipping insurance. Save yourself the hassle and pay an extra $100 from a watch company. All that said, I have a TAG Calibre S and absolutely love it. Great watch."
2,Talented singer?,"I've heard two of the songs on the Jennifer Lopez CD. I don't think she has a talented voice, I'm not saying she sounds horrible but for now I definitely don't plan to buy her CD. I think she should stick to acting, which is what she's a lot better at."
1,Huh!,"Stick with the acting or modeling. She is a very beautiful girl, but her voice is not all that great. Keep your mouth closed."
2,I'm not impressed,"Businesswise,I can see the logic behindthis release.Ricky Martin blew up thespot,and now is the time for Latinos torepresent.Yeah,yeah,yeah...I get it,butstill,Jennifer isn't the one. For starters,My Love sounds like everyother mediocre R&B fluff joint litteringthe Urban format today.What,Brandy hadthe day off? It is very clear to me thatPuff's worked OT on this one,but Jennifer's voice doesn't bring it,notlike other Boricuas(India comes to mind),her voice lacks that uhhhh! needed tomake this album work. Regardless,it should do well.I neversaid the video was wack,and in the visual arena,Ms.Lopez is always on point.Do us all a favor,Jennifer.Stick to acting,and leave music to the pro's."
5,"good beat, good song",i thought it was a good song. she took a good beat and used good lyrics to make a song i thought was very catchy. i thought it was ok at first but now it's grown on me and i cant wait for her next release.
2,There's always acting...,I was anxious to hear this single but I can safely say that the song is nothing without the video to accompany it. The lyrics are ridiculous and Ms. Lopez sounds like an ethnic Paula Abdul (hardly high praise). I guess I'll know to skip over this cd when it is released...
4,Actress crosses the line into pop!,"When I heard that Miss Lopez was recording an album i thought whatever, but then i saw the video and heard the song, can we say the latina is going to triumph the charts. dont let her actress status keep you away from the record store, she will melt your heart and put a buzz in your ear. YOU GO GIRL!"
2,She looks better then she sounds...,"Sure, she's pretty, she's got a healthy body, but her voice doesn't really cut it. It's kind of... squeaky, I guess. Sorry, Jennifer. I have nothing else againest you, though! You have a nice face (by the way, was that Rouge?)."
2,SHE CAN'T SING,"I've listened to this song and seen the video about 25 times. Jennifer is a beautiful woman and on her way to being a very good actress but she is not a ""singer"". Her voice is weak and thin and her ad libs are stiff and awful. You can tell she has no vocal range. What's even worse is that she sounds this bad and you can tell they've done studio magic to make her sound as good as possible. The video is eye candy for men and the track (music itself) is okay but I can see that producer Rodney Jerkins'(The Boy Is Mine - Brandy/Monica) tracks are begining to sound the same. That's the best thing I can say about it. I never thought there could be a singer worse than Paula Abdul but it appears that Jennifer fits the bill. Please stick to acting Jen, maybe even dancing, but singing is CLEARLY not your bag."
2,Really Buggy,"Extremely buggy game! After waiting almost 8 months for it to be released, I was incredibly disappointed in the game play. I really is no better than the last Links game, and I couldn't even turn on the gallery because I didn't have sufficient RAM! (I have a 550 G4 powerbook with 512 MB RAM, running OS X) I really is too bad that stuff like this is release after all the hype. It sort of makes Mac users look bad.After creating a Tour name, I now can't even play it, because it kept crashing on me after shot. Now it crashes when I resume the tournament. So, I created a new tournament, played about two holes, and it starting its crashing again. Very disappointing. I thought it may have been something I did, but after reading the rest of the reviews . . . . ."
3,CE help,"For many, depending on their system configuration, to get CE to run properly who will have to turn off background animations (including the flags waving), use panoramic as opposed to dynamic camera views, turn graphics setting down to 3, and in some instances shut the sound off. Once you do the game will more than likely work for you (though possibly better in 9 than X).Follow Nick from the UK's advice and check out the sites listed for further help getting CE to run for you."
5,Best book!,Of course this is a great book - what other story talks about bringing down a king with one great burp! Classic book.
5,yertle the turtle,a simply wonderful book. I highly recommend this book .my brothers loved this book . they loved the way dr. Seuss rymed his words in a silly way- Macy r. tegt
1,Excruciatingly Boring!,"This movie was just plain BORING. I am a great fan of Merchant-Ivory films (A Room with a View is one of my all-time favorite movies), but this movie was extremely disappointing in contrast with their other films. I watched it all the way through because I kept thinking 'it has to get better.' Unfortunately I was wrong and it didn't. I haven't read the book, but definitely won't now. It felt like they had all the right ingredients; great cast, great director, and beautiful locations, but they just couldn't pull it all together in the end. I am surprised that there are so many good reviews for this movie, as the only extraordinary thing to me was how dull and uninteresting it was."
1,Major Disappointment,"As a student of the Merchant Ivory films (Howard's End, Room with a View, Maurice, Remains of the Day, and Mr & Mrs Bridge)I found Golden Bowl to be all glitter but no gold. The acting, plot and casting were all single-star ratings. James Ivory must have just given up his artist standards."
3,"Good Story, but Not Enogh Drama","The Golden Bowl has the most dysfunctional family I've seen in a long time. Thurman and Northam play lovers who are split when he decides to marry Maggie, the daughter of an American billionaire played by Nick Nolte. Then it gets a lot weird when Thurman's Charlotte marries Nolte's Adam while having an affair with her now son-in-law(?). Sounds like Melrose Place, huh? Well, the story and the acting are fine, but the movie definitely needed some passion and sparks, especially when Maggie discovers her husband's affair with Charlotte. I don't think that the reactions of the characters regarding the affair were realistic at all. No one seemed to want to acknowledge what was really going on around them.The Golden Bowl is not a bad film, but it was pretty lifeless considering the storyline. Great cast, but not wnough oomph."
5,BEST BOOK EVER! MUST BUY FOR EVERYONE!,"After reading this book, I was amazed at how simple her concept and rules are. She does all the math for you, it's so simple to follow. In fact, it works out perfectly for my busy, on-the-run schedule. What more could you ask for, YOU CAN EAT OUT AND LOSE WEIGHT!"
2,Waffle,"The author is either more interested in being regarded as a master wordsmith than explaining why the hyperinflation happened, or he just couldnt make sense of it (but couldnt come out and admit that).I'll give you the skinny:page 9. ""Before 1914, the credit policy of the Reichsbank had been governed by the Bank Law of 1875, whereby not less than one-third of the note issue had to be covered by gold...In August 1914 action was taken both to pay for the war and to PROTECT (emphasis mine) the country's gold reserves. The latter objective was achieved by the simple device of suspending the redemption of Reichsbank notes in gold.""For me, the above excerpt was the only salient section of the book. It is good if you want accounts of the effect hyperinflation has on society. However I was looking for an explanation of WHY it happens, and on that basis the book is poor."
1,"Rambling, Boring, Uninformative",I was hoping for a book that would project what is in store for the U.S. if we continue on our current path. Instead I got a rehash of the German military after W.W.I. After 1/3 throught the book I deleted it from my Kindle - it wasn't even worth storing it for a future read. My subject line above says it all.
3,Just Average,"Many of the training methods in this book are outdated, such as physically forcing your dog into specific positions instead of using lure/rewards. It promotes physical correction instead of positive reinforcement. Being published in 1996, I'm not surprised it focuses on some outmoded training methods.While there is some useful information regarding the CGC testing and some tips on how to prepare for it, it's not worth buying the whole book.A newer edition that goes in depth on how to prepare for the CGC and focuses on positive reinforcement would be a better buy, as would a book written by a trainer or behaviorist that uses positive reinforcement-such as Dr. Ian Dunbar."
5,What every dog should read!,"This is an excellent primer for teaching your dog good manners and was very helpful when I began teaching my dog, Coco, to be a pet assisted therapy dog."
2,Flimsy cups are not worth the price.,"I had to return these cups because they arrived with 2 of the cups shattered to bits, despite being well-packed. The reason they shattered is that they are so flimsily made that they are bound to break eventually, most likely sooner than later. At any price this is a shame, but at $30 for 4 cups, it's an outrage! I returned them for a refund - I definitely would not order a new set."
5,Very nice set of cups,They look beautiful (they also havent broken and seem perfectly durable contrary to other reviews)
1,"Released, again?!?!","For those who haven't seen this movie before, just get a copy of ""MST3K the Movie"" and you can watch it. Otherwise spend your hard earned dollars on this film and watch it half-asleep without the comments of some hecklers. Personally I think the hecklers are a nice touch and keep the sanity of the room grounded. But alas, it's your choice."
3,"Item is an old videotape, but watching it was still rather rewarding.","The movie was certainly one of the best sci-fi films of its era. It had the usual special effects that onewould expect from a film of its type, but it also had definite tragic overtones and in that respect transcend-ed its genre(just as THE FLY managed to do)."
5,Count me in: this film's a winner!!,"An impressive, imaginative early science-fiction thriller, in which Earth's best scientists are drafted to work for an imperiled alien civilization. The characters are all paper-thin, but the plot is reasonably dense, and the special effects -- particularly the sets and minatures used for the outer-space sequences -- are brilliantly ambitious and creative. A nice bridge between the hokey serial films of the 1930s and '40s and the 'Sixties era of ""Star Trek"" and ""2001."" Recommended![Cast notes: also-ran Jeff Morrow plays the too-butch lead, Faith Domergue (who specialized in this kind of role) plays his bullet bra-ed co-scientist. And check out young Russell L. Johnson (best known as The Professor on ""Gilligan's Island"") as one of their colleagues.]"
3,Holds Up Very Well,"There is wonderful momentum built in this movie...I love the complex where the scientists are housed...it's the most unnerving section of the movie.The acting is functional...I rather like the heroine--both cerebral and fleshly.The special effects for the most part are excellent. Superb matte shots and the depiction of an annihilated landscape is chilling. Yes that brain-hominid-insect guy is fake, but somehow, effectively used, anyway.This is intelligent sci-fi, well worth seeing.david g"
2,Probably good for its time,The movie was probably a breakthrough when it came out in the fifties but I found the story and special effects lame and the movie kind of boring. If you want a good 1950s space flick see Forbidden Planet.
2,Classic?,"Poor script, poor acting.The only reason to buy this film is to look at Faith Domergue -- Howard Hughes lover since she was 15 -- and try to figure out why he spent millions trying to make her a star. Yeah, he failed."
4,Classic Sci,"One of the best of the 50's. Introduction to the ""Interociter"" (sp?), Remote control, Space Flight, Flying Saucers, Aliens and of course, Dangerous Mutants. Part of the Atomic Craze in the 50's. I like 'em all so I may be biased. This is one you can watch over again. Right up there with Earth vs. The Flying Saucers and Forbidden Planet."
1,"Old stuff, atrociously re-mastered","I never thought I would give a one-star review to any Frankie Yankovic CD. But this one is just plain awful. It's all old stuff, some of it dating back to the late 1950s. There's nothing wrong with re-releasing historical recordings, if it's done right, but the sound quality here is abysmal. It sounds as though it went through an analog tape recording device with dirty heads and/or azimuth alignment problems. The high-frequency response is almost non-existent, and there is noticeable tape hiss and an occasional tape drop-out or two. I am forced to wonder whether the artist had any knowledge of this CD when it was released. Stay away!"
1,something missing here too.,"just like "" by order of the president "" Something is missing here. Pretty dull reading. I have read everything Mr. Griffin has wrote and his last two have been disappointing."
5,Classic WEB Griffin,"I really liked this book, could hardly put it down. Very well done, with lots of detail on the back channel approach to getting things done in the govt."
2,No- Action Slog,"Like many W.E.B.Griffin fans, I have read all of his books, and, for the most part, enjoyed them. A wide-ranging global tale of this sort is certainly enhanced by the details Griffin is famous for. By mid-book, one gets to know the characters, the country(s), the love interests, and the (forever recurring)Famous Grouse. This book, however, never takes off. There is a hint from time to time of ominous characters waiting to pounce on Castillo, as he in turn amasses his own good-guy forces. Trouble was, it just took too darn long; 300 pages of stage-setting was too much for me. A big thumbs down on this one."
3,Returned,I returned these salt and pepper shakers as they were MUCH darker than pictured on-line and on the product box. They were closer to a dark chocolate brown.
4,More Feedback,"This item goes great with the canisters, and I really like the appearance. Would recommend as a compliment to the canisters."
2,Didn't Perform As Promised,The blade didn't perform as expected. My dog is a Pomeranian with fairly long and dense hair and I expected to use this attachment clip to give a decent haircut without scalping him. I knew the clip that came with the Andis clipper I bought cut the hair very short and was looking for a somewhat longer cut. Unfortunately this clip didn't work on my dog's hair at all. Ended up using the clip that came standard with the clipper unit (3 mm) to do the job which scalped the dog. The kids were terrified!
2,Clipper Blade size 3 3/4FC,"Another waste of money. This blade won't even get into the pets fur let alone clip it. It's a Shih Tzu and his fur was only 2"" long and the clipper blade wouldn't do a thing. Very disappointing but so are the clippers."
2,"Not totally useless, but close enough","First, this thing can only be programmed in 4/4. And you can't quantize; you're stuck with 16, 32, or 64 beats per measure. Forget about a genuine swing beat. Also, I'm sure there are tom-tom drums somewhere among the drum menus but I can't find them. There are about a million snare samples and countless squeaks, blips, honks, etc. If you're doing club stuff this is probably a useful bit of software but if you're looking for something that resembles a drum machine you'd use for rock/pop/roots demos, forget about it. My ancient Yamaha RX17 is much more useful."
2,iDrum is lame,"If you're serious about programming drums, do yourself a favor and buy Reason. Redrum, reason's drum machine, is soo much more programmable, not to mention it lets you edit waaay more parameters than iDrum does and it comes with a BUNCH of samples. As an added bonus, reason has soo much more stuff for you to play with if you ever get the urge to add anything else to your songs."
1,Poor quality,"This item is much darker then in the picture, and the finish is substandard (came with its own fingerpints in the paint) and I expect to last a few months as the tear off spindle does not tighten completely and leans as the wind blows. Unless you in love with a DARK antiques finish look elsewhere. We only purchased it as a match to the canaster set, same qualities"
5,Excellent quality.,this matches my faucet beautifully. it is heavy enough it doesn't fall over when you pull a towel off. I love it.
2,Did not meet expectations,"I ordered this book based on the great reader reviews it had.After receiving the book and had a chance to look at it, I am not sure why the great reviews.A second book I ordered, ""The Ultimate Windows Server 2003 System Administrator's Guide"" by Robert Williams and Mark Walla is a much better book."
4,quick and easy transaction,the item came in a timely manner and was what i expected. the only thing that i didn't know was that there was highlighting in it.
2,APC 403660HLD head light assy.,These lights look great until you install them. Fit is very poor and they protrude out about an inch more than factory. I will be cleaning and reinstalling my factory lights. A total waste of my money.
4,"Well, Well, Well..","Overall, I like the book. I think it is thought provoking. I believe that there are many things in-which the author should have shown his sources. Certain things like claiming that the Phoenicians started the Egyptian civilization is inaccurate, or at the very least, lacks in evidence. It is a known fact that the Egyptian Civilizations oldest inhabitants are known to be the Pigmies. It wasn't until the Sumerians pushed their way into the North Eastern part of Africa that you get the start of the 46 Dynastic periods.But all in all, I like the book. I think it is a good read. I just prefer books Like THE CONSPIRACY FRAUD by Jose M. Paulino, that have documented evidence."
5,Useful,"A book filled with delusions, mind-control fantasies, and unverifiable or bad science. The points are unintelligible, the references obscure, and the writing self important and depending in the main on his ""sources""; IE the ""former mind-controlled sex slaves"" whose programming has frayed on the ""death of their programmers"".Careful monitoring of those who purchase this book will ensure who believe these fantasies do no damage, not that they would ever challenge the true illuminati."
1,Reverse conspiracy,"A lot of lies are rolled into a ball of intriguing truths. This is another of the steamrolling right wing conspiracy books taking some truths and twisting people worse than when they started. Some members of the Illuminati pretend they are the true Paul Revere, yet they are closer to King George the III. The real Paul Revere warning about the coming Lobsterbacks (Serpents in human forms) was actually a true and good Freemason. Be very careful about people presenting truths who are making a living out of it. Really, really think for yourself, dont even believe me, but dont take 'Snakeoil' salesmen to tell you the truth."
1,Comparing This To Liar's Poker Is A Joke,"I have read Liar's Poker, and Bombardiers, you are no Liar's Poker. Not even close. The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is uneven, the scenarios are utterly and completely unrealistic. All in all, an incredibly painful read. If you haven't read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker instead; if you have already read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker again. It's that bad."
3,Definitely not the real thing,I was initially skeptical of this product because I know there are a lot of colognes on the web that are knock offs. However I trusted this product because it was a amazon approved seller. However it is obviously not the real thing. The fragrance lasts about 2 hours while the real deal will stay on your clothes until washed. The smell is more or less the same.
5,An Outstanding addition for anyone interested in Egypt,"This book is an outstanding translation and presentation of the books that make up the Papyrus of Ani. Faulkner is far superior to Budge, and this book proves it out. In addition to the beautiful pictures and fine translations, the commentaries in the back, along with the explanations of the vignettes contained in the papyrus are well worth the money. A must for anyone interested in Ancient Egypt and their culture."
3,Review,"I gave it a three because I thought it contained other information, but however it is a good guide to the ancient rituals of Egypt. It's contents just tell about what they said and all during the process of the ceremonies."
4,A classic by a classic!,The recently deceased Richard Rodney Bennett delivers a set of Great American Songbook classics with the addition of his own hauntingly beautiful title composition. His masterly accompaniment and smoky raspy voice combine for a beautiful emotionally potent record.
2,D.O.A. GONE DOWNHILL,ANY EARLY FANS OF DOA WILL PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS CD. THIS IS MORE LIKE SOFT METAL INSTEAD OF HARDCORE. ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT.THIS RATES 2 STARS.
3,Not as good as the old ones,"This is not a bad album! It is maybe a little dull in a sense that there is not so much energy as in some of their older albums.If you want to experience D.O.A. at their best, try to find an older album (e.g. Bloodied... but still unbowed) But this album is still a good introduction to the world of D.O.A."
4,"4 years of non-stop use, no problems","This router is one of the few electronic purchases that I have no regrets over. I haven't experienced any serious problems at all and it's been over 4 years of non-stop use. Unfortunately the settings are a little dated for me. The router doesn't support WPS, no guest, nor does it support 802.11n, despite having MIMO capabilities. Speeds are good enough to watch streaming videos and movies online.If you just need a reliable router to setup a network that doesn't need 802.11n capabilities than this router is for you. For less than 50 dollars you can purchase one of the most reliable routers out there. This router is still very relevant and can be updated (check the version first) to use the third party firmware DD-WRT. Supports WPA2."
5,Works fine right out of the box,"Received the 3 antenna version, it worked fine right out of the box. No issues with connections to my SRX laptop card. I'm finally able to connect from the opposite end of my house."
1,It's not as great as they say it is..............,"I bought my Linksys SRX WRT54GX because I was told it was among the best (""8X Faster and 3X Farther""). I have had to have the technician who set it up come back out to the house 3 times simply because the signal cannot get from one side of my house to the other side of the house.It is no better than the old Netgear MB103 that I was using before but it was 4 times the cost of a less expensive router. If you have tough to reach rooms, this is not the router for you."
2,It has bad reliability so I need reboot it every few days.,"I had Sx200 for two months. This router stops working frequently and I have to spend about 15 to 30 minutes to reboot it every few days. This is big issue if you are using internet for real time tasks such as stock trading. But its coverage is good and setup is easy.Finally, I bought DLink-634M to replace it last night."
1,Not worth the price and the antennas break off easily,"This router is overpriced compared to other similar MIMO products, especially once you buy the required interface card.The unit isn't very stable after you have several ethernet cables plugged in. My unit fell over, which caused two of the antennas to break right off!"
1,avoid,"The handle does not work. It does turn but it doesn't move the spool, brand new reel right out of the box. Don't buy it, avoid penn reels, their quality is going down the drain every new reel they make. Their new name is penny reels and fishing rods because that is what they are worth..."
1,reel,I though penn reels were made in USA. I have several and they are all made here. No more penn reels for me.
2,"Soft, cushy, but sloppy","These slippers run a little wide. While they are very soft and cushy, and even have soles that will endure a little outdoor time, I found that they are a little sloppy. By that, I mean my they fall off easily, and my foot has a tendency to slide in the left slipper to the outside of it(I do have pronation/supination problems), but it makes it feel funny and unbalanced. I think I'll revert back to a harder soled slipper the next time I order."
5,A fine textbook,"This is a first-rate text for anyone interested in understanding the exceptional learner from a ""characteristics"" point of view. Case studies and an easy to read format make this a student favorite. The only complaint about the book is the exhorbitant price for a paper-back. Few are available used, because it is a wonderful refererence."
4,Jesus the Rebel,"Video stresses Jesus's desire to reform certain aspects of the Jewish world from within and to consider if not participate in the contemplated uprisings against the dominant Romans. It particularly discusses the noticeable absence of references in canonical scripture to the ""Roman"" city of Sephoris, built by Herod Antipas(Whom Jesus called ""that fox!"") Sephoris was located within ten miles or so of the probable site of Nazareth.Jesus could hardly have ignored the city. Good history on an unusual survey of an interesting aspect of Jesus' life."
1,QUESTIONS GOD !,"THIS VIDEO DOES MORE TO DOUBT JESUS,THAN TO GLORIFY HIS LIFE IT BASICLY SUGGESTS HE DOES NOT EXIST . IF YOU ARE A BELEIVER IN JESUS CHRIST LOOK FOR TAPES ON THE ORTHODOX INSTEAD OF THIS BLASPHEMY OF JESUS CHRIST THE ONE AND ONLY TRUE SON OF GOD!"
3,"Decent net, but feels flimsy","Got this for my annual fall leaf cleanout, and it worked fine. Kept me off my hands and knees digging in the pond to get the leaves out.Pros:- Telecoping handle so it doesn't take up too much space- Soft exterior on net (not sharp metal or tough) so I'm not worried about puncturing my pond linerCons:- It does feel flimsy. I'm not sure how this will hold up to a couple years of use, or if I were picking up things heavier than a leaf."
4,Jack Pre-Booze-ouac,"A must-read for Kerouac afficionados. The depiction of his teenage years in Lowell, though sentimental at times, are some of his most beautiful prose; full of sunsets, football and first kisses.Kerouac-Virgins should check out his 'On the Road' or 'The Subterraneans' first."
5,Elvis is back...with a vengeance!,"This was Elvis' first studio LP after being in the army for 2 years.(Try and picture one of today's artists being drafted and pulled away from the spotlight for 2 years!) ""Elvis is Back"" is a remarkable record: Pop, gospel, rock, blues (and, oh, the blues on this record!)...this is pure Elvis! He would go on to record a couple of other great studio LPs in the early 60s (""Something for Everybody"" and ""Pot Luck,"") but, unfortunately, all would be overshadowed by the soundtracks. When ""Blue Hawaii"" topped the album charts for 25 weeks, the dye was cast: Elvis would be stuck doing 14 song ""travelogues"" for another 7 years; but this album catches Elvis in great voice and spirit. Elvis was back, baby! Buy this record!"
4,Great helpers!,"We had a couple of these small dishes with covers as part of a set, and kept on using them up to store -- specifically freeze -- food like mac&cheese etc....so tried to find just a set of them with lids at a local store with no luck.... After finding them here, we ordered 4 more of them and now have plenty for storage and use. We really like that you can heat up tomato based sauces without staining the CorningWare -- however, the lids do stain, so we put plastic wrap under the lid for microwave -- even defrosting. Of course the stains don't affect the performance, but it's a bit of an eyesore/anoyance anyway. Overall, great product."
5,not just a great punk record- one of the best ever made,"this album is amazing and while this band is highly under rated and not well known, i think they've been extremely influencial to a lot of bands. their musical influence is equivalent to the aesthetic/attitude influence of the (...)pistols. the best band of the late seventies ""punk explosion"" (...)."
5,start here with Wire,"Wire's 1977 album PINK FLAG has been unmatched since, by Wire or anyone. Short, odd, angular, sarcastic songs, 22 in all, remind the listener that punk rock can be simultaneously smart, detached, and visceral. PINK FLAG is an essential punk rock album, standing alongside THE CLASH, NEVERMIND THE BOLLOCKS, THE RAMONES, and THE UNDERTONES as the best of that era.Note: r.e.m. covered the track ""Strange"" on their 1987 album Document. The original is here on Pink Flag, and it sounds great.New to Wire? Check out Pink Flag, then Chairs Missing and 154. A compilation entitled ""1985-1990: The A-list"" is a good summary of that stage of their career, and it also makes a good compliment to Pink Flag.Do you have Wire CDs already? Pink Flag is the best of their pre-1980 releases, and their best overall. Don't miss it.ken32"
1,THIS CD IS EMBARASSING TO SACRAMENTO RAPPERS,"DOC'S FLOW IS WEAK, HIS LYRICS ARE WEAK AND THE BEATS ARE WEAK. HE ISN'T ANYTHING WITHOUT LYNCH AND THE SICCMADE FAM AND HE WILL NEVER OUT DO SETTRIPPIN BLOCCSTYLE. HE'S BITING THE HAND THAT FED HIS MOUTH BY DISSING ON SICX AND LYNCH IN HIS SONGS. DON'T BY THIS CD"
4,"Great price, aesthetically pleasing.","I was looking to add a third fan that looked similar to two that were already installed in a home I purchased last year. I saw this fan was made by Hunter, the same brand of the other two. Based on a few pictures I saw on Amazon.com, I felt it looked similar enough, and upon receipt, I was immediately happy with my purchase. The fan was relatively easy to install and operates very quietly. It is an luxurious looking fan for such a low price. Great value!"
4,"Great Fan, a few minor drawbacks","Pro:- Very quiet operation.- Lots of extra wiring if you want to use a longer downrod.Cons:- Uses candelabra bulbs and not the medium base listed in the description.- Manual uses graphics to identify which screws you should you. However, the drawings don't match the hardware provided. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to figure out which ones to use where.- Chains even with the extenders are short for me (5' 5""), and I need a stool to reach them."
1,Fan,I purchased this product on line through Amazon. I paid an electrician to install it and noticed it was a little noisy now after only minimal use(approx two weeks) it has stopped working. Since I no longer have any of the packaging I cannot return it. Stuck with a lemon that I will have to pay to have removed. Buy direct from store then you can still return.
2,I sent it back,"Unfortunately, the unit I received did not work properly when my electrician installed it. The lights worked, but the fan part did not. It was sent back and I purchased a different Hunter model that works great. I've owned other Hunter fans and they have performed as expected."
5,Really excellent fan,"It is really a wonderful ceiling fan, But the installation instruction has to be improved.Bulb which was supplied with the fan was not an energy efficient."
4,"Great fan, easy to install","I'm very glad I went with the Hunter Astoria for my bedroom. I've had it for a month now and it is great. The style is elegant and it matches my bedroom set perfectly. It is as quiet as can be and does not wobble. I've read reviews that mentioned the light was not bright enough, I think it provides plenty of light for my master bedroom. Any brighter and it would be too disturbing for the eye. The airflow is great, I always keep it at medium speed and that's sufficient enough. I would certainly recommend this fan over the cheaper fans, it makes a world of a difference. The only con is that it doesn't come with a remote so I have to get out of bed to pull the chain when I want to turn it off."
2,Light Globe Arrived Broken,"I cannot rate the fan itself because I found the globe was cracked in half when I opened the package. Thank God I had not strewn all the parts about and was spared the nightmare of trying to repackage. I do not know if it was a packaging problem at the company or if it happened through careless shipping. I returned it immediately. I am disappointed in the way Amazon now requires me to return items through the USPS instead of through UPS. In my view, if they deliver it to your door through UPS, then they should be equally ready to have it returned from the ease of your doorstep instead of having to lug it to your vehicle, drive to the post office and lug some more up the steps to hand over. It was not this way in the past."
1,Not Very Professional,"I have ordered many things online , from A to Z. This is the first time I received a product that looked as if it was 30 years old. The outside of the box was dirty, the attachments were yellow as if this product was very old, there was no return information included in the box, etc. Would not buy this product, nor could I recommend someone ordering from a company that would mail this product in such an unprofesional manner!"
2,"Written for the lay person? Yeah, right.","In the beginning of his book, Mr. Zukaz swears up and down that he is a lay person and that if you are a lay person too, don't worry; you will understand the concepts in his book.I didn't. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent fellow; college educated, cum laude, steady career, and so on, but I simply could not follow what he was talking about. My wife was reading over my shoulder at one point and noticed the complex diagrams Mr. Zukav uses to explain a concept and she pointed out that it didn't look like it was written for a lay person as I had told her. I had to agree.I have a genuine curiosity about the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics and this book did not sate my thirst."
5,Personal Trainer/Nutritionist LOVES this book,"This book has been out of print, yet I continue to buy amazons stock of these every month for my clients. Adele came before South Beach and the Zone and the Blood Type and so on diets. She truly wrote a book anyone can follow, and made it a LIFEstyle plan. Not a prison. There are no ""you can't have that"" pages. The brand new ""pink"" program and all those merely take this standard, smart, helpful original and add to it. Granted there are updated version of this; but help my clients with those updates and modifications not in this original. Now there are all kinds of premade frozen meals and myfit foods and lots of things in stores that work with Adele's program without having to count dang calories or points. Its visual; its lifestyle, its take with you when you travel or eat out kind of thinking. Learn why you can't lose or gain easily. Forget willpower..its chemistry, and she was there first on this one."
5,Thank you Adele!!!,This diet (new eating habits) has put the control back into my life. I have been suffering for years with a chronic illnes and now I feel great!!! It truly is a miracle. I would have never believed that I could feel this great! And its so easy to follow. I strongly recommend The 5 Day Miracle Diet AND The 5 Day Miracle Diet Companion is a must! Forget Jenny its 1-800-98-ADELE!!!
5,The 5 Day Miracle Diet worked a miracle for my dad.,"I bought this book because I eat banana's, bagels and yogurt and wondered why I wasn't losing any weight. I had just finished reading the book when my dad called to tell me about his doctor's visit. Dad is 67 years old and was seeing the dr. for a check-up. Also his arthritis was bothering him, and his stomach - bloating, upset. He was intrigued by the information I was reading to him from Ms. Puhn's book and he began to call me every day asking me to reread various portions from the book. Finally, I told him to take the book home with him. Well, eight weeks later, he was 30 lbs lighter, his dr. took him off his high blood pressure medication, his triglyceride count dropped from 700 to 146, colesterol counts plummetted, and my dad was feeling 40 again - no more afternoon naps, renewed zest and energy. Dad! I WANT MY BOOK BACK!!!"
5,Video is better!,"Although the 3 original albums are better, the video from this period is INDISPENSIBLE! I'm speaking, of course, of their Rockpalast show from 8/14/79, which still looks as fresh today as it must have when it was first broadcast. And it's SO GREAT to put a face to those voices and see those songs done live!"
5,Magnifica,Amazing novel. Un clásico de la literatura !Muy cómoda la lectura por kindle. Siempre debe estar en una biblioteca
4,Demasiados pensamientos,Demasiados pensamientos personal es entre los autores y poca comunicasion entre ellos para ser exacta me uviera gustado Mas conversasion entire Lizzy y Darcy..... en fin burn libro
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"This was a little disappointing. I read it from time to time, for about a year, but I was never really inspired. I'll keep looking for another inspirational book."
2,Not Original Corningware,"This item is not like the original CorningWare. A company called World Kitchens bought the rights to the CorningWare name and uses it on stoneware products. The product is made in China, not Corning, NY. My real complaint is the limited utility of the dishes. A sheet that comes with the dishes warns not to use them under a broiler, under a microwave browning element, in a toaster oven, or any other direct heating source. Obviously, they can't be used to make creme brule or shrimp scampi."
3,Disappointment,"The dimensions listed for this product in the ""product details"" section are 5x2x8 inches. Unfortunately that is with the plastic cover in place! The dish itself is 4 1/2 x1 1/2 x7 at the top and only 3 1/2 x 6 inches at the bottom. It is too small for the purpose I had in mind when I purchased it. It is still an attractive dish and I imagine I will find other uses for it, but the dimensions are misleading."
2,okay until they add the drum machine,this compilation cd is okay but not compelling. until they add the drum machine. then it becomes insufferable. did they ever add a real drummer? who cares.
1,very disappointed,"You shipped me the wrong ""version"" of this product, in other words, NOT WHAT I ORDERED !!!!I had to go to the trouble of shipping it back. In speaking with your representative, she stated ""we sent you the largest one we had"". I informed her that that was not OK because it was not the one that I had ordered. If they didn't have the one that I ordered in stock, someone should have told me so that I could then make the decision as to whether or not to cancel the order or accept a substitute.This whole situation was totally unacceptable !!!!Cathy Carbone"
3,"I hate to give anything by Nico 3-stars, however...","...as is usually the case with most Nico releases (especially those released posthumously), it's a deceptively identified collection of mismatched recordings. This one claims to contain her last studio tracks, but it's actually a couple of excerpts from her last concert mixed up with the usual Drama Of Exile material found elsewhere. This one was generated by her son, Ari, and her manager, which should have given it a certain amount of credibility, but they dropped the ball and rushed this title to release shortly after her death. The music is great, of course, but the definitive album for her last concert is Fata Morgana. Buy that 5-star title instead."
1,Apex makes junk and doesnt fix it,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
5,Very good series,It was a very good trilogy and also easy reading. I really enjoyed the story line. I will definitely be reading more from Julie Ortolon.
5,Watch it over and over!,"You're never too old to enjoy Alias Smith and Jones. I had watched all the episodes, except this pilot. When I found it on Amazon.com, I had to have it. Hilarious! Watch it over and over! Not a lot of Pete Duel's work is out on tape. Hopefully, the rest of this series will be available soon."
5,Fabulous Video - I loved it,"While I've seen all the Alias Smith and Jonesd shows, I'd never seen the pilot episode and I am SO glad I got it. I paid $... Canadian - and it was worth every penny! It was fantastic - it set up the whole opening, explained the story right from the beginning, answered questions I'd wondered about - it was so much fun! I was grinning ear to ear and thoroughly engertained. It's something I could watch over and over and not get tired of. I love Pete Duel and he shines in this video. I love Ben Murphy and he was fabulous too. The chemistry between these 2 actors is apparent. I'd love to have the rest of the show on video too - Universal, come on!"
4,"Not the best, but a good effort","Pennywise has always been a top list name in the indie punk scene. Add to that the fact that they have a grooving yet hard as hell sound, and they put out solid efforts in all their albums, then you've got yourself a punk band that's sure to stay for a long, long time. Straight Ahead proves that with a sonic attack of catchy hooks, insightful lyrics, and anthem driven songs alltogether. Try the title cut, ""Greed"", ""Alien"", ""Can't Take Anymore"", and ""Badge of Pride"" to hear what I mean. They may sound a little repetitive at first, but give it some time and the songs will grow on you and have you pumping your fist in the air like a madman in no time. It may not be the best punk album out there right now, but great enough to have your mouth salivating for more. To keep it all simple, hardcore, potential-filled, punk rock that has you wondering ""Is punk really dead?"" A must buy for those who want that question answered."
2,"PENNYWISE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER, ALOT BETTER","THEY COULD HAVE DONE ALOT BETTER I MEAN THIS CD IS OK BUT I THINK THEIR PAST RELEASES ARE BETTER, THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD IS ""ALIENS"" AND I GUESS THE OTHER SONGS R OK"
2,"ummm, did I miss something here?","Well, call me crazy, but I don't really listen to this piecer much. I've had it for many months and have been waiting for it to grow on me. I remember hearing Full Circle and Unkknown Road being blown away, so it's not that pw is a lousy band... this just sounds so... not hype. Buy some of their old stuff, or even better some old Bad Religion and you'll see what I'm talking about."
3,Pennywise Polical punk at it's best,"I bought this album on the strenth of their many bootleg covers and the song 'badge of pride' there are no doubt about it some real jems here, the reason however I have given three is becuase simply the album on a whole is to repetitive, but I stress is still a good album, the lyrics are great and have real meaning and ui'm sure with pennywise the best is yet to come!"
5,Straight ahead kicked butt!!!,"I love Pennywise, I can't wait to see them at warped tour this year! I have all of their cd's and i bought straight ahead the day it came out. My favorite song is watch me as i fall. Pennywise was the first punk rock band i ever listened to and i think they are the greatest!!!"
3,Paid by the word,"A book largely about reporters who write puff pieces and there was an awful lot of puff. I lost patience with this book early on during an endless digression into the Altamont Rolling Stones tragedy. It's okay to write a sprawling book full of digressions, but you need strong characters to anchor such a novel and this one lacked any. I admit to not finishing this one."
3,"Good writing, but all over the place...","Grandiose undertaking presented in a convoluted epic of a story. Whitehead writes parallel stories that engage and is presented in a straight-forward, albiet alternating fashion, until about half-way through the novel, where it seems he loses focus or becomes bored and starts interjecting a series of new sub-plots in alternating seccession in the guise of a contributing back-story, but in reality this takes away from the main story. Once it's over, a feeling of importance permeates, but for all the loose ends this feeling is diminished a bit."
1,The Recipes Do Not Work!,"The recipes in this book do not work. There are much better cookbooks out there. If you actually want to make the recipes, buy a cookbook written by someone who has actually tried and made all the recipes in a book. Cookbooks should be written by cooks and not by celebrity wives hawking their transparent causes. This book will disappoint you."
4,Great Cookbook! Too bad he stole the recipes.....,"Too bad Mr. Imus stole the recipes! Chef Ron is a great chef and Deirdre Imus is a rip-off! What a Lemon-head, why would he try to use someone else's ideas and not give chef Ron the credit? Were just waiting for Chef Ron to come up with his own books. If Mr. Deirdre Imus wants to make things right, he will make it up to Chef Ron and Michele and give credit where credit is due. At least include him on the next book so he can get the recognition he deserves. I live in Las Vegas Nevada and I've been trying to get him and his wife to move out here. He would be a great asset to any fine Restaurant here in Las Vegas, Nevada. I ate at one of his restaurants and it was the best!"
1,imus thiefs,that woman has some nerve as well as no cooth to steal her chefs recipes and write a book to benefit her....Makes the public wonder what she is using those sick children for.
1,It's ......AWFUL!!,"To quote the Iman...it's AWFUL! I merely looked over it in the store out of curiosity.....and like the cat, it nearly killed me.As for the vegan diet or whatever it is.....if it is supposed to be so great how come...1) the Iman is always and forever sick or pretending to be so.2) their horrid foul mouthed brat is already overweight at age 5Don't waste your money on it. The Iman claims it is great, but as we all know, his opinions are the same as the last person he spoke with. He will probably turn on his own dimwitted child wife and pan the whole venture about the same time that he turns on scary hairy Kerry"
3,Brilliant but too difficult,"At last someone who is willing to stand up against the fadism in the church, while being part of the new church movement. This book needs several readings to absorb its important contents. However, it is difficult to read, as it is the product of a PhD thesis and is not written for your average reader. Please make the effort to read this book if you want a fresh and stimulating outlook on the future of the church."
1,wrong amazon info...,"the Beirach ""Sunday Songs"" cd on the main page links directly to this ""Sunday Song"" mp3 download. however, they are two entirely different recordings. someone should fix that problem. and to be sure, my ""1 star"" rating has nothing to do w/ the music. just the incorrect info. i have ""Sunday Songs"" and it a beautiful solo piano recording..."
4,Great value.,I got these for 39.99! Nice find on a Friday Sale! My dad loved them and uses them constantly. They hold up extremely well.
5,The backpack is wonderful,"The features on this backpack is all I need. A very fittable size, two large water pocket. The color is totally black, not easy to get dirty. The price is also reasonable."
4,North face jester,This bag is excellent for textbooks and many other heavy books.Light bag and durable!I hope to use this bag till senior year of high school!
2,Kid Favorites Maybe Made a Tiny Bit Healthier,"Who are they trying to kid? The ""Wake-Up Cocoa Mix"" may have nonfat dry milk powder in it instead of higher-fat milk, but no kid needs miniature marshmallows first thing in the morning (if ever). Their idea of healthy is certainly not mine! Some of the other recipes are a bit healthier than this one, but even so, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Great novel, but a corny film","I had to read the novel Fahrenheit 451 and then compare it with its movie as a school assignment. I was very disappointed with the movie, mainly because it did not have the same scenes and characters as the book. I give this movie 1 star because I can't give it any lower. Don't waste your time with this movie but make sure to read the novel."
4,Force to Be Reckoned With,"When I first saw the film version of Fahrenheit 451, I was offended by the way Francois Truffaut treated the original text. Important details were left out in order to pursue his own personal vision of the future. Somehow I find it wrong to title a film after a book of the same name when the interpretation is so loose and vague. On a more positive note, Julie Christie, despite popular opinion, was true to her role and even a bit frightening, which can be expected in this particular story. Oskar Werner, whom prior to this film I had never heard of, put an amazing amount of depth and passion into his role, yet managed to retain the sense of dividedness that is necessary for the character of Montag. Had this been an Academy Award-rate film, Mr. Werner would've been my choice for Best Actor."
5,Haunting & Grey,"This film by Truffaut still ranks amongst my all time top 10. It's pace and the muted blue and grey color scheme may not be for everyone, but these characteristics are what make it so great. Wonderful acting (especially the unspoken angst of Oskar Werner) and a haunting score. The ending images are simply unforgettable - the warmth and melancholy are akin to climbing inside a Nick Drake song on a grey autumn day."
2,Hard to understand!,"I think that this movie was very hard to understand because of the characters' accents. The charaters in the movie hardly talked, but when they did, they talked very fast. The background of the story was good, but the movie wasn't. I really suggest that you read the book. I understand that it was made a long time ago, but I think that the special effects need to be updated by a director of this time making a new production of Fahrenheit 451, the movie. If you do not like reading, then you will get the basic idea of the story, but I strongly encourage you to read the book!"
1,The worst movie ever made,"If you read one review for this movie, let it be mine. I don't know what sort of valium these other critics are on, but if you are a reasonable person you will abhorr Fahrenheit 451. They took Ray Bradbury's classic, and butchered it beyond all recognition. I have forgotten most of what happens (thankfully), but I will never be able to extract that dreadful music played during the firetruck sequences from my memory. To date, this has been the worst movie I have ever seen. To poor, even, to rent for a laugh. I suggest we take Cpt Beatty's advice for this one, and BURN IT!"
4,A classic anti-utopia,"Ray Bradbury was never a hard science sci fi writer as his Martian books were off in science when they were written, but in terms of literary acceptance he has led the pack.Here a world where the printed word is being destroyed,we see what can only be the fall of a civilization as motor manual'sare necessary to keeping cars going.I've always wished that we would put the important elements tosomething like stone that can't be bashed by vandals invading.Memorization is how many of the bardic epic poems have come down to us,but for non-poetry prose is very hard for most people,so the idea of a lot of people each memorizing one book doesn't seem practical.I liked the movie just the same and I think that it was made in Britain tells you a lot."
3,"Fast service, good value","By old school standards - 4 stars. But today, 3 stars. Pretty accurately foretells the evolution of TV programming in the 21 Century, mindless garbage that does nothing to stimulate individual or innovative thinking. The news is only what NBC, ABC and CBS cares to tell you. Audiences involved in production outcomes."
4,Good Fantasy,I don't read many fantasy novels but this is an enjoyable read. The characters are well developed and there are numerous monsters and creatures throughout the story. The plot gets a little tough to follow but it is at its core a good vs. evil story. The action sequences throughout the book are very well written and suspensful. Clemens is a great writer with a vivid imagination. I am looking forward to the second book in the Godslayer chronicles.
2,Too much work watching this,"Evidently this is supposed to be some sort of black comedy. Unless you like keystone cops, there is not much comedy; it is more of a surrealistic missing of the mark.Michael Crawford ""A funny thing happened on the way to the Forum"" (1966), is supposed to be some sort of inept WWII officer. This film is full of colorful characters (painted red, blue and whatever).There are a lot of noisy overlapping claptrap and gobbledygook statements. It is unique enough not to be anything. The only thing missing are the Muppets.You would be much better off watching ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" (1966) It has a moral and redeeming social value.The Magic Christian"
2,Follow-up,This is not as interesting as the author's first work; 'The Queen of Sheba' remains as enigmatic as ever. It reads like a diary of someone's extended holiday and reveals little which is not available from other sources. I read 'The Road to Ubar' with interest and hoped that this would be equally engaging. I think that if I had read this one first I should not have bought the earlier book
4,The Duke Wins the War,"John Wayne defeated the Japanese Empire in World War II. At least that is what this movie tries to show us. This is, all kidding aside, a good movie. The Duke plays the commander of a submarine(starting when the Japs murder the first commander of this sub). There is plenty of action, a good romantic subplot, and an excellant plotline. I recommend this movie-it is very entertaining."
3,Laaz Rockit,"I give this album three stars because there's three good songs on it.If you're a fan of Laaz Rockit then buy this album,that's why I bought it,it's worth it just because of Laaz Rockit,they do the song Leatherface which is one of their best songs.Then you have Wrath on this album,I don't like Wrath but they do the song When Worlds Collide which is pretty good,they have one of the best riffs on this song that I have ever heard and then Sacred Reich-One Nation,which is an awesome song,that's also on this album."
4,Homes-In on Something Valuable,"I bought about fifty of these cheapie CDs in bulk a while ago, because there are some chamber music items I wanted. But this one is one of the surprising ones. I have no idea who Scholz is, for all I know he is pseudonymous. Perhaps a more modern version of those old Royale lps of old, which Ernst Lumpe, whom I met for lunch in Duesseldorf in 1996, did such a good job at cataloguing. Anyways, this cheapie is very fine. In fact I am not sure I have ever heard better performances of these lesser known tone poems. Of course Les Preludes has had a many brilliant performances."
3,Punk Sucks Is Still Better,"Well on paper this comp looks impressive. It has a lot of recognizable bands, actually it's got a lot of bands, period. However, it has a lot of songs from lesser bands that aren't that good. Actually pretty much the same collection of bands put better songs on the Punk Sucks comp. Still it does have songs that are worth the listen. 30 Foot Fall, Diesel Boy and Ten Foot Pole have the best songs in my opinion."
2,SLOW RESPONSE,"THE MOST FRUSTRATING ITEM ON THIS CAMERA IS THE SLOW RESPONSE TO TAKE THE PICTURE. PUSH THE BOTTOM, AND WAIT A SECOND OR MORE BEFORE IT RESPONDS . . . MOST OF THE TIME MISSING THE SHOT YOU WANTED TO GET."
5,Thorough and useful book,This book is thorough and very useful. It is also supported by a blog which is updated daily. The author reports on every Fourth Amendment case as it is decided and keeps you abreast of those pending and then decided in the United States Supreme Court. I highly recommend this book.
2,More about the author than the process,"From a ""former editor of scholarly books"" I expected better. Instead of informative, I found this to be more an annoying autobiography of Toor herself (do we really need to know about her dating life or her pet pig?) with run-on monologues about the Duke admission process. I suspect that what little information this book had to offer could be summed up in a pamphlet, and is of interest mostly to prospective Duke applicants or alums."
3,"Simple, easy-to-understand guide for first time owners","This is a rather short, simple book written for first time ownwers. The pitfalls of this book are that only a little over half the book is written specific to bulldogs. The remainder is general dog information about training and specialized training for certain canine events like agility and field trials, typically NOT things bulldogs are good at."
4,Quite Good But Flawed,"I've read this book five or six times, now. It took that many times for me to truly understand the principles presented. All in all, I think this is the best and most thorough investment book I've read on the quantitative side of valuing stocks from an individual investor's point of view, but with that said, it does have some significant flaws.The biggest problem I have with the book was the way mathematical principles were presented in such a way as to shield the reader from the math (i.e., instead of using equations, he presented a sequence of key pad operations for a calculator). This made it much more difficult for me to grasp the fundamental concepts than would have been the case with a simple fluid presentation of the equations involved.Even with it's flaws, this book is well worth it's purchase price for the dedicated individual investor."
3,Deserves credit for being on the right track,"The author was on the right track: there are a lot of similarities between Jesus and Caesar, and it is no coincidence. However, the reason is not that Jesus IS Caesar. The reason is that the character of Jesus was MODELED after Caesar to show that the freedom fighting Jews of the time had their very own leader, just as powerful and popular as Caesar, just as divine as Julius, but instead of the empire of Rome he was fighting for the kingdom of god."
2,It's ok-but........,The originial Dominion Tank Police was more entertaining-this gets caught up in a bunch of metaphyiscal baloney. And the dvd selling used for 185 bucks!?!?!? You've gotta be kidding-I've got much better anime to spend my money on.
2,"read one, read them all",Alan Weiss is taking advantage of his readers by essentially taking a pamphlet worth of information and stretching it into a hard back book. Most the the essential information was imparted in one of his first consulting books (Million Dollar Consulting) which had value. Read that book and you are set with much of what he has to offer.
3,Remixed,"I just picked this up today brought it home & to my keen since of hearing, they had remixed this album from the way it originally sounded, and all it took was for me to jump to ""Polk Salad Annie"" to know what I'm saying. Right after Elvis says ""Some of you all never been down south too much..Some of you all never been down south too much"" and starts to laugh a little bit, right when he starts to laugh you could hear a woman scream in the original, which is now missing in this re-release. Now I know to some people, this is not an actual grip, but for me it is. When people start tampering with an original it's a big deal, especially when it's Elvis's music. Now there's dialogue in this that wasn't in the original, crowd response & such. It's like they took stuff out & replaced it with other stuff. If you like the original, this is not it, if you're one that don't mind remixes then you won't be disappointed."
4,Lotion works great - carabiner is tinny and flimsy,"I am a mosquito magnet and this lotion worked great for me. Part of the reason I purchased this product was because of the carabiner feature. I attach sunscreen and bug repellent to my kayak, backpack, etc. I didn't expect the carabiner to be load bearing but I did expect it to be sturdy enough to keep the lotion secure. This is the only product I've seen with a carabiner so I will order it again and replace the carabiner. Oh, one more thing - the cap broke off the first time I used the lotion."
1,no outer package so no expiration date in view,"I am in MOSQUITO CENTRAL...with West Nile Virus at the peak of its season & when I applied this, I was bitten at least 20 times in 10 minutes.I looked for a expiration date but there was not one.I am sure this is expired or it would have worked.This was a waste of money & now I have to pray those bites are not from infected mosquitos.West Nile is DEADLY!!!!"
4,Never Ending Story,Malcolm Smith revisited. What On Any Sunday - Revisited left out was a revisit with the legendary Malcolm Smith. Still great unseen OAS footage and updates with the characters from the original including comments from Kenny Roberts.It might seem a rehash but it's a fitting tribute 30 years later.Watch On Any Sunday and OAS - Revisited first and it all fits into place.
3,"On Any Sunday-Motocross,Malcolm & More.Enough Already.","How many times are we going to ""revisit""?? I like On Any Sunday,I understand this is footage not seen before along with interviews and how riders and people were influenced,But there is nothing much to add to On Any Sunday already."
1,We must be truly desperate for a great writer . . .,". . . if we're passing this swill off as the next great stuff.Dear Secret Dickinsons and Melvilles,I know you're out there. I know it's a garbage-fest right now. We need you, though. Wake up, wake up wherever you are; we're the ones sleeping not Them; They have been waiting. Gather your collective psyches. It's time to cast some Light on these rodents."
3,I missed the point of this one,I think I read this book to fast. Should have been more in the moment. Language and descriptions are excellent. Just had a hard time getting into the spirit of the narrative. I love the other books I have read written by David Eggers. This one wasn't my favorite.
2,Good but not,The fact that I have looked up what others have to say about this book as I'm now in the middle of it does not bode well for a critique. Writing is good however story's plot leaves something to be desired.
5,A doozy.,"I thought the book was good. It deals with mortality, friendship, loss, being lost, wanting to be lost and fear --and does it all with realism. How many people feel poetic when their best friend dies? vs. How many people act ridiculous and desperate and come up with a scheme to rescue said friend from the hospital in a fashion that makes absolutely no sense 6-months later?The characters are real and the story overall reflects the oddity of being a young male, not quite a man, not quite a kid, not quite anything.The inner dialogue was interesting and revealed quit a bit about all of the characters involved and I especially liked learning about Jack and how he fit into the trio of friends.If you liked ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" then chances are you'll enjoy this book."
4,"Disturbing, but sticks in your brain","While reading this book, I didn't enjoy it all that much, though I've liked others of his. Seemed a bit too soapboxish and not as funny as it was trying to be. However, snippets of the scenario painted in it (all the doomsayers on global climate change are right) have arisen unbidden in my mind several times since. To me, that's one sign of a good book, raising its rating from 3 stars to 4."
1,Don't buy!!,"I usually enjoy T.C. Boyle books...This book was not as engaging but still good, until the last few chapters. The book ends in mid sentence, then repeats the previous chapter. I mean it actually stops the story in mid sentence & then repeats itself & omits the ending. Very frustrating. I'm sure my book is not the only one with this glaring misprint. Do not buy!"
1,Maybe Next Time,"This was my first Boyle book, and it left me unimpressed. I found the characters to be shallow, unsympathetic stereotypes. There was a wealth of images he could have followed through on: weather changes, species extinction, human (and animal) disease, and he left it all undeveloped. He did show a skill for weaving metaphors, however, and some were fascinating. I will try his short stories, as someone suggested."
3,Science Fiction / Fantasy worth reading,"Boyle wrote a well thoughtout book regarding the series of events that could destroy the earth to a pithy mass of nothingness. I normally avoid Science Fiction / Fantasy stories due to the unbelieveable storylines that drag the reader through pages of muck about fairies, aliens, or unicorns.Boyle has the gift of storytelling and is able to roundout all of his characters' idiosyncracies--not an easy task. Flashback storytelling is dangerous for most authors to try. Boyle succeeds with believeable events and ascerbic wit.The ending is rather weak. Kind of like: ""I'm sick of writing this book and need to end it."" I would have enjoyed the ending to be as well thoughtout as all of the events leading to it."
4,Great value,"For the price you can't beat this toy. My daughter got this toy for her 2nd birthday. She is 2 1/2 now and played with this kitchen almost daily. It would have been nice if it had a sink and fridge and maybe more food but for the price you can't beat what you get. There is a microwave that you pop popcorn in, cookies, cookie sheet, blender, etc. I actually like the fact that it does not take up too much room giving room for other toys."
4,My daughter LOVES this but...,"When we bought the toy it already had batteries in it so we never had to install any , but now that they have died we have NO IDEA where the batteries go! If anyone knows please post a review or email me. Thanks so much!!"
3,Find something more sturdy,This toy was great at first. Within two weeks my 2 year old had destroyed it. It constantly tipped over on my 1 year old too. Myhusband threw it away after he had to put the oven door back on for the 100th time. I would buy one of those bigger sturdier kitchens.
2,To small,I was disappointed when the magnet came it's so tiny I feel I spent to much. I could have got a bigger magnet for cheaper but it hold papers good.
5,Buffalo wireless router,"The router was very easy to program for my particular system, and its operation has been flawless since day one. The increased output power makes the wireless portion of the system work without fail. All in all a very good unit for the price, and just what I needed."
1,junk,this product is the worst product I ever purchased. I bought this product and had nothing but problems. I called tech support who was niothing but rude to me who told me that the router was defective and to return it. I returned this router and decided to try again so I purchased the same router again and had the same problems all over again. I would not reccommend this product to anyone.
1,Poor customer service,"Linked up with my windows computer ok, but spent hours w/customer service to work with my mac laptop and had no luck. Just went out and got a apple router and both link ups were automatic, no issues."
1,"APPLE COMPUTERS USERS, BEWARE!","You can set up this device as an access point using Apple Macs - if you are a computer jock with nothing to do with your life. Please see the lengthy Buffalo response and the procedures on how to configure the device as a bridge using the Apple OS via. the web browser. NOTE: Windows users get an autorun autoconfigure CD, Apple users get a hard time.Sent it back, bought aCisco-Linksys WET610N Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming and Video Adapterinstead, set it up in five minutes. Second one for me, first is still running after one year, no problems.This review has been edited - please see attached responses for clarification."
1,Poor films,"Purchased for ""Never Wave at a Wac"" which was a major disappointment.Poorly written and generally uninteresting. ""Four Guys Named Joe"" depends a lot on Jane Wyman who is very long in the tooth for a young and eager airline stewardess. I would guess that her acceptance as an actress was a bizare aberation of the late 1940-50 period. The other two films are totally forgetable."
3,The Cranberries worst Effort,"If it weren't for Delores' awesome voice, this CD would go right in my toilet. The songs are all very grumpy, and just don't make you feel good at all. I listened to this CD like 20 times while driving in my car, and it just didn't grow on me at all. My fav. songs though are desperate andy and track #2, its pretty funny."
3,Their worse CD so far. Listen to it before buying it!!!!,"After waiting so long for a new Cranberries CD, this was a big disappointment. No more than 2 songs will probably make it in the top 10 and the rest is just to make a recording. Yes, it sounds like the cranberries but is not up to par with their previous releases. If it had been their first CD, I would had not been a Cranberries fan. Borrow it from a friend before buying it so you can make up your mind and not go for what others tell you. I just expected a lot more quality from them."
5,New favorite,"I purchased this after hearing the author and his books discussed on NPR and I wasn't disappointed. I took their recommendation and started this 3 book series by reading the second book, Dancing at the Rascal Fair, first. I loved the development of the characters and their complex choices about family, love, and frienship. The story immediately draws you into the personal lives of the characters and deepens your understanding of what it felt like to be in that particular time of American history. The book covers a familiar theme, young men immigrating from Scotland in the early part of the 20th century to settle in the west and start their families. But it is such a personal, rolicking, adventure and love story that it reads like a new version of western stories. I can't wait to get the next book, English Creek, to continue the saga of the families."
5,Top Notch,"This is an outstanding book that helps any parent and teacher understand and better help, encourage and teach students of any age. I absolutely love it."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I was concerned that this book would be too heavy on the high school romance. It isn't. I was concerned we would get way too much outsider angst. We don't. The book is moody and atmospheric. The 25th hour is a wonderful angle. The actual threat and its resolution is sort of incidental, which is OK by me, and explanations for the phenomenon are sketchy, which is also OK by me. Gaps and inconsistencies are fine by me if the tale is absorbing, because I think quality writing, interesting dialogue and engaging characters are more interesting than convoluted plot lines and quasi-sciencey explanations. I don't know where this fits in with other Westerfeld series, but it certainly seems to be worth a look on its own."
4,An interesting read,It starts off a little like ... odd kids don't fit in ..so you think it is about bullying. But it really focuses on their oddity. So it got much more interesting as you read through it. Then you don't want to put it down. It is a fantasy but it makes you wonder...The pieces fit together nicely. It is not so absurd to seem way out there. But you have to like fantasy. Easy read.
4,Floating Crystals,Midnighters is a book about a girl who discovors the town she just moved to freezes at midnight except her and a few other kids from school.The first night she is in town it rains. All of a sudden at midnight the sound of pouring rain stops. When Jessica goes outside she sees little crystals floating in the air. As they sparkle in the moonlight Jessica touches them and finds they are wet. When these crystal like things are touched they fall to the ground and form into a small pool of water.Midnighters is one of my favorite books. Evil creatures that usually don't bother Midnighters start coming out to get her and just while she is trying to figure out her power. She trys to balance school and being a Midnighter. It is interesting to see how she deals with all the things in her life with the new school and midnight. This is just one of the many books in the Midnighters series and I look forward to reading them all.
1,disturbing,Found this book disturbing. Let's see Diana sleeps with the son (Guy) and then the father(Holt). She takes awhile before telling the son she is not interested and yet he keeps pursuing her. I think Diana is to embarrassed to admit to Guy she slept with his father. Diana is actually closer in age to Guy than Holt. Essentially Holt is old enough to be her father. Holt never shows anything but animosity toward Diana. At one point he mentions how easy it would be to snap her neck. This is my first time reading a Janet Dailey book and it will be my last.
3,Ruth Wallis -- Slightly Abridged,"Being a comic drag queen, I was absolutely thrilled to have discovered works by Miss Wallis nearly two years ago. I own several of her LP's and a few 78's...This CD was a delight to find -- recordings without the crackle. However, for ""the best"" album, I feel that it really runs short of highlighting some brilliant songs she's done.These are studio recordings -- showing off her clear voice -- and all have incredible orchestration. This is really a must-have...Feel free to contact me with any questions.... Thanks!"
5,Works great.,We bought 4 of these for the office. Assembly was easy and they work perfect for holding our maps and prints.
5,"""How Children Fail"" Read this before you put your child in knidergarten!","John Holt writes an excellent book full of helpful insights. Obviously, spending time in the classroom is key to his research and theories.I've often found myself looking for insights in order to help my own kids suceed in school settings. With so many books on the ""must read to keep informed list"" don't forget this one which is still timely."
4,Great Insight,I learned a alot about the difference in learning styles by reading this book. It helped tune me in to what to look for and to expect in the classroom. It also made me aware of the reasons that more families are choosing to homeschool. Thank you for the information.
3,Just Not Enough!!,How Children Fail by John Holt was a good book for teachers. I didn't like how the book was journal style. John Holt shouldn't have focused on How Children Fail but on How children Succeed.I would recommend this book for student teachers and parents. Teachers can use this book to have a feel of how public schools are and what goes on in the classroom.
2,How Children Fail,"This is a very good book for Special Education classes. However, I found it a very poor book because it was very repetitive and detailed. It would talk about Cuisenaire rods and detail different ways to use them on many different days as well as making it sound like they spent hours on just that activity. There was also a balance beam idea that was good. The book was written in the form of daily notes and not chapters and was just very hard to follow."
4,How Children Fail,"In ""How Children Fail"" John Holt gives his perceptions about how children to fail. He takes the reader into the classroom and gives accurate accounts of children's fear to fail. He takes you through what has trained them into this behavior. Their fear encourages them to grasp strategies that hide their learning shortcomings. Holt believes that teachers have been trained to entice learning but promote failure. The teachers are described as faulty. Their teaching methods do not adjust to changing generations of children. It is not just teachers but schools that are contributing to the diminishing of learning. However, Holt assures his audience that real learning does exist.I recommend this book to teachers, parents, and students. I give it 4 stars for it's easy to read format and descriptiveness. I think if enough people read it Holts insight will heighten our awareness and stop children's fear of failure."
5,many years searching,"I've been looking for this particular album since 1997, after I heard it played on a Tampa, FL radio station. Not knowing the exact date it was released, I've been playing the hit-or-miss game, during which, my Gaither collection has grown immensely!! That's OK, of course, because Gospel music is wonderful worshipful listening. I wouldn't part with any of my ""accidental"" orders. Thank you, Amazon music, and thank you, Tex-style music (the seller of my used CD), for carrying hard-to-find items. Hopefully, more people will be persistent (downright stubborn!) and discover what you can find for them. I called your toll free number, and I think ?Maria? found it for me. Anyway, friends in Christ, Amazon.com is the place from which to buy music - current and antique!"
4,Very good,"A very nice collection of short stories by Anderson. He is a great realist writer and this book shines. It shatters the stereotype of the small town, and the grotesques are very interesting people. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in realist literature."
4,winesburg,Very good book outlining a small city in Ohio such as Clyde! Author did a fine job illustrating what this city did during the late 1800's and early 1900's. Easy to read and enjoyable to read!
5,The Wings of Eagles . . . John Wayne masterpiece.,"Waited a long time to be able to watch John Wayne, in one of his best performances, at home in the comfort of my atmosphere. His performance is just as large on the small screen as on the Big Screen! His work with Maureen O'Hara is like watching Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers. They always seem to create a masterpiece of showmanship to include love, comedy, drama, suspense, and just plain entertainment for the viewer, all within a span of time that is usually too short lived. It is easy to want the plot to continue, but you have to realize a movie must end. Wayne's character, ""Spig Weed"", is so real, it's refreshing to see a TRUE STORY that is captivating. This movie will always remain very high on my list of ""Got to See"" movies!!"
2,John Wayne,"This movie was all about the military character John Wayne was portraying. Not so much about airplanes. I was disappointed there were not more airplanes. It's all about Army vs. Navy, I did not relate to it too well."
4,Not bad show,"The episode started out at a good pace, but the ending was a bit slow & predictable. Overall not bad, would like to see additional episodes."
3,"Nice Scenery, but","the plot was just too convoluted and improbable - especially the ending. The protagonist has just returned to England from Africa, working there as a mining engineer in pre-WWI days. Bored at the local gentelmen's club, he returns to his apartment to find himself engaged in a serious spy situation and accused of murder. So off he goes, both to escape the police and to save his country - en route, he also finds love."
3,Cool,"NOW SUP WIFF THIz, ALBUM IS BANGIN, 4 SHO, BUT YA DIG, SHE HAZ FAR 2 MANI GUESTz ON IT I MEAN ON EVERY SONG U'LL FIND SOMEONE ALONGSIDE MERCEDEz MAKEN MUZIK. I DON'T KOW IF SHE COULD HOLD HER OWN BECAUSE SHE HAS 2 MANY GUEST 2 PROVE IT, IT IS SOLID THOU I HAVE 2 GIVE IT THAT & THE MAJORITY OF THEY ALBUM IS TIGHT & MOST OF THE GUEST HELP STRENGHT THE ALBUM, CLASSIC NO NO NO, WORTH THE MONEY? POSSIBLEY, STABLE? YAH IT SHOULD NOT B SLEPT OWN THIz IS NOT A CD THAT NEEDz 2 B N YA COLLECTION, BUT IT WON'T HURT BEING THERE EITHER."
5,great c.d.,"this is a great c.d. YOU CAN PUT IN IN FOR C.D. PLAYER AND LET IT RIDE FROM BEGINNING TO END. EVEN THOUGH IT CAME OUT A LONG TIME AGO ITS STILL RIDES TODAY. MERCEDES SHOULD HAVE CAME OUT WITH OTHER CDS. BUT SINCE SHE DID NOT, ITS STILL GREAT TO ADD HER ONE CD TO YOUR COLLECTION."
4,Excellent bare-bones DVD copy,"The film itself has been reviewed elsewhere, so I'll just say that it is reasonably faithful to historic events as I understand them - with some inevitable combination and excursions in screenwriting. The acting is solid and the story flows well. The DVD itself is one of Warner's ""Archive Series"" and pretty much bare-bones, consisting of the feature film and one trailer.The video quality is excellent, and I'm quite happy to have it in my collection."
3,"All the radio hits and a few extras, typical ""best of""","Counting Crows are one of my favorite bands, I wasn't surprised or let down by the track list of this CD, but I was hoping for something extra. About a month ago there were rumors fof a pack-in DVD or limited edition with a b-sides CD and neither of those ended up happening, instead we get another multi-media enhanced CD (yawn). Die hard fans of this band have all the albums and Counting Crows aren't really a causal fan type of band. With only two new tracks to offer, this CD just doesn't live up to todays standards for what a ""best of"" should be."
4,A great comp !,"This is a great compilation frot eh casual Counting Crows fan like myself ! The addition of the great ""Einstein On A Beach"" makes it almost essential.And it has a great ""mix"" feel to it like the Sheryl Crow compilation which also is NOT in chronological order ! A good deal all around.."
4,Missing some tunes but a must have!!!,"Great album, but its missing a few good tracks. I defiantly suggest you buy it and just grab any songs that you might want. All and all killer album."
3,Pretty Good,"Most of the information is good, but there are some things it recommends that I wouldn't. I thought the cages she recommends are a little small, and that some of the bedding wasn't appropriate. Other than that, it was all right."
2,AX 87th Precinct - could have been better,"I thought it was a little dull. The characters did not seem three-dimensional. Maybe it's because I can't relate to that time period, though."
3,Minor Entry in the Series,"This is one of the shortest --- and one of the weaker --- books in the 87th Precinct series, which McBain has been writing since 1956 and is approaching 50 volumes. Generally McBain succeeds in creating a complex and intriguing mystery with minimal elements; but here he seems a little short of ideas. However, fans of the series will enjoy it; it's fast paced and engrossing, and by now most of us are so enamored of Hawes and Carella that we're not too particular about the details. Those who haven't tried McBain before should probably pick up ""The Hecker"", ""The Con Man"", or ""Killer's Payoff"" for a taste of the early 87th Precinct."
1,What a great deal! An eleven year old calendar. And they only want a few-hundred-dollars for it!,"To be fair, this ISN'T the $10,000 photo (signed by all Three [of the six] Stooges, at the time.That'd, appropriately, be $3,333 a signature.Truthfully, while I have ALL of the THREE STOOGES movies, and short-subjects that Amazondotcomsells, my wife would put her knuckles directly to MY head -- like Moe -- if I spent my retirementincome on THIS or the original -- older -- picture.Well! Maybe my income tax return'd cover it!"
3,It grows on you,"When I first started reading this book I did some pretty heavy eye rolling. Some of the characters' lines and personalities are sooooo cliche. But, it had one redeeming quality... It was hysterically funny. The actions and responses of the heroine, Deana, had me laughing till I actually cried. So, I kept reading. Before I knew it I was into the 2nd half of the book and it really actually started to get pretty good. Albeit fantastic and unbelievable on the scifi side, it was holding my interest. By the end I was rooting for the couple and smiled as I read the last page.This is not a book I would typically read but overall, it wasn't bad. It is definately not a book I would re-read. If you want a believable scifi plot or romance, this isn't one. The hero is the typical super macho type that won't take no for an answer. The heroine is more believable given the circumstances although she is more accepting than I would ever be. The mystic is engaging but you don't get to see him as much."
5,Hilarious and Sexy,"I absolutely love this book - it's one I'll read over and over again. Dara Joy did an excellent job of keeping the novel exciting, funny, sexy, and fast-paced. Unlike a lot of romance authors, she doesn't bore you with a lot of unnecessary detail to skim over. When detail is given in a Joy book, you know it will be a significant part of the plot in either this book, or the other books in this series.Dara Joy also did a great job of expressing how a woman of our day would feel if she suddenly found herself taken to another time/planet/dimension. Not to mention how torn you would feel when faced with choosing between your home and someone you've fallen in love with. And she manages to weave it throughout an extremely hilarious dialogue.This is the first novel in the Matrix series. It helps if you read them in order. Follow this one up with Rejar and then Mine to Take. More books are following - I definately recommend this whole series!"
5,I WANT MORE!!!,I simple loved it! It was funny and sexy ( what a combination)I read it in one night. I also read Rejar and I wish there was an endles supply of stories like this one. I deffenetly WANT more END
4,SEXY..,"Based on the reviews i ordered all of the Matrix of Destiny series,i loved the plot and the humor was excellent, the only thing i had difficulty in was the way Lorgin treated Deana, still Dara Joy had done an excellent job."
2,Knight of a Trillion Stars,"No matter how good looking a man is, for him to be allowed to completely take over a woman's life, ordering her around, etc. - I never felt sorry for the heroine, just disgusted by her lack of backbone."
3,"Humorous, Sexy, but...","...it was a little too sexist for my taste. Oh, I enjoyed the book in some of its parts. The humor was wonderful and kept me giggling through the reading...the suspence was grand, the intimacy was hot...but the 'hero' was a large, domineering, sexist male. And the heroine did indeed let him do it to her. I grew quite frustrated and irritated with his treatment of her and her submissive mannerism. So although the book was funny and well written, I do not think that it deserves five stars. At least that is my opinion. I've no taste in men like the hero."
4,Newbie Q'er,This was a gift for my brother who is an avid griller/smoker - unlike myself who merely dabbles. He lives on the Northeast coast and grills nearly year-round. He was thrilled with the book. He liked the variety of recipes and tips for both newbie and 'seasoned' outdoor meatmeisters. He recommended I get one for myself if I wanted to improve my bbq skills. I take this as high praise for the book as he has never read a cookbook in his life!
2,Makes a great butter dish!,"LeCreuset Stoneware Petite Oval Casserole. Cute little thing that makes a great, but expensive, butter dish. Might be a ""casserole"" for a Barbie Doll."
1,There's No Business Like Land Business,"The title should reflect that this book is a ""novice"" or ""layman"" view of what the business is about. I work daily within the land development realm. This book paints the subject as being quite simplistic, leaving the reader feeling the buzz normally felt at a Multi-level Networking Seminar. If it was this easy, everyone would do it."
5,Deliciously Dark!,"What a creep fest! This film is fantastic.The idea of having a manservant, like the main character does, is frightful in itself- I certainly wouldn't want anyone lurking around picking up after me & every movement I make. Shiver!When this particular hired helped (played to perfection by Dirk Bogarde), brings his sex kitten 'sister', into the household, & the sinister sex & drinking begins- watch out!It's enthralling to watch, & brings up thoughful (albiet dark) ideas about class, & friendship & working relations- a definite thriller & one of the best I've seen.Highly Recommended!"
2,End Of The Road: The Final Tour '95,A Grateful Dead Movie. Not very pleased with it bercause for me a Dead movie needs to be a comp[lete show and this isnt
5,GO AVRIL!,This is 1 of Avril's best songs. I know that Avril's second album is gonaa rock! Don't tell me is gonna be a hit and this is a great song!
4,a rating based solely on the music,"I liked most of Avril Lavigne last CD, so decided to buy this single. I live outside of the US, so I don't get a lot of exposure to news about the musicians and what they do outside of their music. In any case, I'm simply giving my rating/recommendation based on the music. If you liked AL's last CD, you'll more than likely enjoy Don't Tell Me. I look forward to the release of more songs from her new CD."
5,"WONDERFUL, INTELLIGENT, CRISP","an Absolutely wonderful and inspiring version of this collection... crisp, clean, no show-boating divas.... a boon to your intelligence and an ease to your stress...The Alpha-waves pour from this orchestra and conductor.... played this while my child was being born in the hospital... I think her I.Q. tripled as she came intothe world... made before the drop of the Berlin Wall... strict discipline was in the making of this CD...JUST PLAIN HEAVEN FOR THE HEAD AND THE EARS!!!"
4,"Delicious, Nutrious Muffins","This is a great little muffin book packed with over 100 delicious foolproof recipes. About half are for muffins. Although some exotic ingredients are used, most of the recipes are quick & easy to make. Recipes have between 3-6 grams of fat, though most contain 4-5 grams. This may seem a little high, but the muffins are a bit larger than most. Baking papers are filled to top, producing nice round muffins. Recipes include a wide variety of muffins including those with fruit, savory ones, & coffee cake style. Scones, waffles, hotcakes, breakfast breads, syrups & spreads are also included. The book also discusses equipment & ingredients. Many useful hints & tips are included as well. One of my favorite recipes is the Parmesan & fresh herb muffins. I also love the banana drop scones & strawberry topping."
5,Pause. Listen to a world we can only dream of.,"This book is like a literary time capsule discovered by abookish archeologist somewhere on the African plain.Markham's memories and observations have been painstakingly crafted into a precise,exquisite prose that immediately lets you know you are inthe hands of a consumate story teller. And what a story.Though there is a dispute about whether the prose is Markham'sor her third husband's (Raoul Schumacher), it doesn'treally matter. The story is a finely crafted gem, eachfacet reflecting brilliantly an image of a time that haspassed (or maybe never really) was.Reading the book, you'd almost think that it couldn't getany better ... until you listen to Alexandra O'Karma'sreading. Her cadence, her inflections and everything elseabout her delivery add a dimension to the story thatshouldn't be missed. O'Karma's reading never gets in theway. Instead, the delicate phrases inMarkham's narrative are lovingly and gently caressed andbrought to life."
5,Confirms What Everyone Already Knows,"...That Lennon was a great wordsmith as well as musician. In a perfect world, he would be getting ready to celebrate his Medicare b'day of age 65 next month instead of 25 years since his death in December because some deranged loser wanted notoriety.Thank heavens we have him in print as well as in song to enjoyfor years to come"
1,Sooooo Uncomfortable for Mommy and for Baby!,"This sling is really uncomfortable, both for mom and for baby. I kept trying to figure it out, thinking that I must be doing something wrong because it was just so uncomfortable. I had the right size, and I kept going back to the instructions to try to figure it out. Finally my husband said, ""Stop trying! Use your other carriers!"". I love my two other carriers... very comfortable for me and my baby falls asleep in them. With the New Native, he would scream and cry as I tried to shove him in, and then once he was in there he looked all contorted and his neck was bent in a funny way. I could wear it for about 5 minutes and then it felt like it was digging into my shoulder and the weight was unevenly distributed for my back. There are some really awesome carriers and slings out there-- I recommend getting a different brand for your own comfort, and for the well-being of your baby."
1,A big disappointment . . .,"I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son. When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable. I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face. So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference. It didn't. He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz. I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all. A big disappointment. If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn. A million times better than this."
2,phoned-in,"Well, after debating for a year or so, I finally crossed my fingers and ordered this. No luck; burned again. Ian Anderson does not seem even to be trying.The odd thing about this recording is that its ""bonus tracks"" are much better than the real album cuts. I mean especially ""March, the Mad Scientist"", but I also mean even the live abridgements. The live arrangements and performances are only slightly different, but they are mercifully brief."
3,"Almost, but not quite.","This is the little gospel album that could have been. The music written by D.Brooks seemed inspired, but held back by the poor quality of vocals from the choir itself. Some of the solo performances were good, whereas others came off as not genuine. The album cover is nice."
4,"Very, very entertaining","As the quote goes, ""from the hell of war to the cool recesses of the mind"", so does this book go from Desert Storm to civilian life where a former combatant struggles with an atrocity he witnessed as the war ended, and how to bring the perps to justice. It is a very entertaning story. It is clear that the author has extensive military experience and history, and he weaves them expertly throughout. Getting into the mind of the fighting man is a fearsome task, turning it into a great story is even harder. Bay has done both."
2,no contract,"So this is how you break into the music industry?Not funny to anyone trying to get his music heard.This kind of behavior is a way to get dead or in prison.There is a certain air of destruction and degeneracyin the current music situation.Either you are a ""manufactured"" Partridge familyfrom dizzy studios to TV or you are the son of some rich bossowho is willing to buy you air time?The rap people had to re-manufacture the system to get air play.Ordinary people just haven't much of a chance even with Britishmanufactured get you on TV contests.You suppose the King Presley would get played or a contract in today's world?So this movie is no sale here."
4,Great for Adam Sandler and music fans alike,"All in all, a decent movie that tries to touch on the difference between today's metal and the 60's rock (notice Brendan Fraser denouncing the 60's, then quoting Jim Morrison). Adam Sandler, of course, is hilarious, and great cameos abound (especially by White Zombie). Add it to your Sandler collection, or just laugh at the lunacy (and Kramer's turn at John McClane)."
1,Please,i want to kno why i cant listen to God Has Not Given Us (The Spirit of Fear) so i can hear it and see if its the one i want to buy
3,Not your father's mystery novel,"Yes, van de Wettering is a plodding writer. Yes, his detectives don't do much detecting in this book.But give him credit for his strengths, including characterization, and for even attempting the bizarre marriage of Zen and the mystery novel.If you want a Dutch-flavored detective, read Baantjer. In Van de Wettering's books, the cops are far too unearthly to be nailed down to a specific locale; the Netherlands is just as good a place as any to borrow street names from.All that said, ""The Japanese Corpse"" is not his best effort. He does seem quite uncomfortable trying to navigate the Japanese scenes, and character motivation is either too blunt (girlfriend and cat die, therefore you punch out punks who are torturing another kitty) or essentially nonexistent."
2,"strange, intersting but left me wondering","This is part of a series and it took me a while to separate the two detectives due to the difficulty of the Dutch names. I found the story line interesting, the characters were certainly well drawn and different from the usual. The action in Japan was illuminating. The author however left a number of important details unresolved."
2,Hugely disappointed,"After reading so much hype on this book, I was hugely disappointed. The hero was so unlikeable. False and if I read ""my love"" coming from him one more time when he didn't even LIKE her.... He was shallow and not worthy in my opinion. Her thinking she wasn't worthy was sooooo overdone. It was an expensive book to purchase and a true disappointment for the money."
1,sad,"Ian Anderson often complains in interviews that the name ""Jethro Tull"" hangs like an albatross around his neck. He particularly dislikes being mistaken for Jethro Tull, the historical figure--or something. This is understandable, I suppose, but the solution is rather obvious, isn't it?We can reasonably assume this disc's title song, or just plain title, for that matter, is not intentionally autobiographical, and certainly I would be the last to say that thirty is too old to rock and roll, or, for that matter, forty or fifty or sixty. By the time of this record's release, however, SOMEthing HAD gone wrong with Jethro Tull (the rock group, not the historical figure), and if you don't believe it, just listen to how excruciatingly awful the title track is."
2,Very disappointing,"This book might be good for a total novice, but (a) most of the advice in here will already be familiar to VB6 coders (b) some significant areas with major changes from VB6 are completely overlooked (i.e., database), and (c) though this is subjective, some of the advice seems completely wrong-headed (my particular beef: advising against procedure ""fan-out"", which is one procedure calling many subprocedures. This is in direct contradiction to Martin Fowler's advice in Refactoring, and the key to writing self-commenting code - I'll trust Fowler over Foxall any day)."
4,Some excellent recipes,"This is my favorite cookbook, not because every recipe in it is to my liking, but because some of the recipes are superb. The Cranberry-Walnut Scones and Chunky Carrot Cake recipes (the latter of which is truly vegan) alone are worth the price of the book. I get raves for them all the time. And not everyone likes Southern-style Cornmeal Waffles, but I adore them.Most of the recipes call for a fruit-juice concentrate sweetener. When I lived in the Northwest, I used the excellent one from Mystic Lake Dairy that's available in stores there. Fortunately, the author provides very easy instructions for making your own (involving only apple juice and either a microwave or a saucepan and stove)."
2,i dont know,These pulse of creation series books are chalked full of intricite information on the mind psyche and life but the books seem so old and outdated. I don't like the rhetorical explinative writing. I feel like my head is spinning after a read them!
4,It's not a movie! It's for setting up your player.,"I thought this DVD was really helpful for setting up my new DVD player and my speakers. Reading an old version of Stereo Review told me that this disc was really useful, and they were right. But, it's only for set up and a few demos -- don't expect it to be more."
5,Marlene De Santiago's Review!!,"I loved the book bottled up! Because this story is similar to what happens to millions of teens around the world. In a way I can relate to what happens to Pip, the problems with his family, friends, and school. I reccommend this book to anybody who just loves a good book. Maybe you can relate to what Pip is going through. This book just shows you your better off paying attention in school and listing to your parents,and to not do drugs!!:)"
3,happy i got it! but it skips,"The movie itself is one I watched as a kid, and I was stoked when I found a copy after my daycare kids broke my vhs copy. I was sad that the end of the DVD skipped tho..."
1,Does not work,Sony Disc player does not work. It won't recognize disc in player.Currently trying to get it serviced under warranty.
3,A Player with Plenty of Problems,"I haven't had any trouble with this player as far as it reading discs, skipping or sound quality.This player does use up batteries very quickly, the batteries are hard to remove due to how the space for them was designed (it's not just because they're in the disk tray because I had a Sports Walkman with a similar design, yet I didn't have trouble removing the batteries) and the top of the player which covers the disk tray doesn't fit very closely, so stuff could go under there (including long fingernails). I haven't had any problem reading the display, though it's small and light, so I can see how it could be a problem and the buttons on the player are small, so if one doesn't have small fingers, that could be a problem.Is it worth it? I would be more on the side of saying no than yes, though even when I was given a more expensive player (Sony D-SJ303 S2 Sports CD Walkman), it didn't work very well, either."
4,Good little camera,"This is my first camera of any type so I can't offer many useful comparisons but I can offer an enduser perspective. It's easy to use, the pictures come out quite nice and you can navigate the menus and buttons pretty easily with a five minute browse through the manual. The software it comes with is also user-friendly.I suspect as I learn to use it I will exhaust it's capabilities as I get more experimental and adventurous and need to upgrade to a camera that I can attach lenses to and so on, but for every day use this is a good, nice, light and reasonably small camera. I like it."
3,Not what I expected,"Having read Robin Mckinley's ""Bueaty"", I was really disappointed with this book. The ending was not one that I would have expected andi was very disappointed with it."
3,It was a completely different view of Beauty and the Beast.,"Beauty is devoted to her family, which includes two sisters and a father. So when their lifestyles break apart, Beauty works hard and discovers a piece of property that the family still owns. Two years after they moved into Rose Cottage, which was a little cottage near a village that groes rare roses, the part of the story we all know takes place. Beauty's father is caught in a storm, seeks shelter, steals a rose from the castle, and makes a bargain with the Beast. Beauty leaves her family and goes to stay with the Beast. Soon, Beauty takes a liking to the lonley Beast. She tends to his dying rose garden and befriends him. Rose Daughter is a fasinating, not to mention enchanting, tale of Beauty and the Beast. The end of the story has a twist to it that no other fairy tale has. I recommend this book to anybody who likes tales told in a down-to-earth way."
3,"Not ""Beauty""","I enjoy all of Robin McKinley's books, but nothing can compare to her early work. (i.e. ""Beauty"", ""The Blue Sword"", etc.) The ending to Rose Daughter is very disappointing, and though I loved most of the story, especially all the work she does with roses, I can't get past that the Beast just stays a Beast. Doesn't it seem gross to anyone else?"
5,A lovely retelling a well known and well loved story,"I loved the book, having read many of Robin Mckinley's books I decided to give it a go. It only took me a day to finish because I could not put it down. I loved the rich descriptions and the character personalities. It was a joy to read and I love to pick it up and read it again on rainy days. If you read many retellings of classic fairy tales you have to read this one. Even if you have read her book, Beauty: a retelling of beauty and the beast; You will still love this one. I am glad I bought it and it has a special place on my self."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I Have read all of Robin McKinley's books and I must say this is McKinley at her worst. Rose daughter doesn't hold a candle to her previous novels. All the other book combined fantasy with wit, humor and demonstrated that McKinley is a fabulous story teller. WHAT HAPPENED???? IS SHE IN HER DECLINING YEARS OR WHAT?? I got such bad vibes from this book that I had to read my most favorite part of the BLUE SWORD to get myself back in synch. Do Not Read this book it is a waste of time."
2,Vague and lacking action...,"Like a lot of other people, I had read Beauty and loved it, and so looked forward to Robin McKinley's retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story. I found the first 1/3 of the book fascinating, but as I got farther into the story, I found myself getting frustrated at the lengthy, yet vague, descriptions of things. It was strange how she could go on in great detail about how various roses or rooms looked, yet at other times I found myself re-reading a passage several times trying to figure out what was going on. I really disliked the ending, too--after several re-readings I finally figured out what had happened. The author's imagery was certainly very beautiful, but sometimes it was so out there that it was difficult to catch her meaning. I prefer Beauty much, much more."
4,Great Topic,This book was very interesting even though it's not my favorite book. I loke the story better before Beauty went to the Beast's Castle. I read Rose Daughter as a school book. We were comparing Rose Daughter to Robin McKinley's earlier book Beauty. I think Beauty is my favorite out of the 2 though Rose Daughter is very well done.
4,Complex and Richly Rewarding,"When I first saw Robin McKinley's ""Rose Daughter"" on the shelves, I thought, ""Wow! A sequel to 'Beauty'!"" Then, when I saw it was a retelling (again), I, too, thought, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Of course, I read it anyway. It's very complex, and if you read with any speed (I just tear through books), you'll almost have to read it twice to understand it. Also note down any pages where Beauty dreams; you'll need to look back on them later. It was not ""Beauty,"" however. The angle is completely different, from the sisters' temperaments to the mother and her motives, the town to which Beauty's family moves, the Beast and his background and the climax and resolution. Still very much worth the read -- I haven't yet regretted reading a McKinley book."
1,wtf?!,"I have always considered myself a fastasy freak. I've read over a hundred version of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, etc. So I can honestly say this book is the worst version of Beauty and the Beast I have ever read.The main character came off as, well, kind of retarded and there is more romance between a brother and a sister than Beauty and the Beast. At times I felt like Beauty was talking to her large dog rather than her ""beloved beast"". Furthermore, the names of the characters were just rediculous. Those of you who read this book, you know what I'm talking about.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to trash talk Ms. Mckinley. I loved THE HERO AND THE CROWN and THE BLUE SWORD, but either she definately lost her touch with this book or some third grader wrote this book and gave all the credit to McKinley. I am so serious, there were grammatical errors in this book."
4,I loved this book,"I loved the story line, I loved the discriptions, I loved how beatifully lyrical Ms. McKinley can make many of her passages. I really enjoyed the fullness of the pictures she painted in your imagination. This book has atmosphere; it feels just as a fairy tale ought. If you like things short and succinct, this is not the book to read. But if you like attention to detail, lots of lurking symbolism, and way too much thought provoking stuff to ponder over in one sitting, this book's for you."
5,A beautifully written book,"I love almost everything Robin McKinley's written. It's too bad 99% of her books don't come in kindle edition, and whenever I try to hunt her down in a bookstore, the only book they have is Sunshine. Give this author some more credit!!"
3,"Enjoyable, but 'Beauty' was better","In 'Rose Daughter,' McKinley expands on and enhances 'Beauty,' a book she wrote twenty years earlier. Both are retellings of the classic fairy tale Beauty and the Beast.I actually liked 'Beauty,' the shorter work of the two, better as I didn't feel that 'Rose Daughter' added anything meaningful that wasn't already there. Part of what's missing for me is the natural progression in Beauty's relationship with The Beast - i.e. from fear to love through trust and compassion. In this book Beauty shows little or no terror at being completely uprooted from her family and forced to cohabitate with a beast-like creature. As a result, her ultimate love for this creature is less satisfying to the reader than it could have been. Still, I recommend it to readers who continue to enjoy the magic of fairy tales, adults included."
5,Dont listen to the whiner below,"I bought the King of Fools EP and loved it, and this next single from Edguy's ""The Hellfire Club"" is no exception. The single contains the regular version of the awesome song Lavatory Love Machine, as well as an acoustic version that rocks too, and they do an extremely great cover of an old Europe song called ""I'll Cry For You"", this cover is so well done and emotive, well played and very catchy (very very catchy)... it beats out the old Europe version by a mile. Also included is a really cool new song called ""Reach Out"", a typical Edguy ""life-searching"" ballad that is quite great. They also included the humourous video for the title track, its by far one of my favorite music videos by a metal band. GET THIS SINGLE, its worth it."
4,Insightful!,"Michael J. Weiss documents the way populations have fractured into different demographic and lifestyle groups, or clusters. He gives these clusters catchy names that describe the key lifestyle features which influence their buying behavior, voting, and other choices. This excellent, original, well-researched book focuses on clusters in the U.S., though Canada and Europe are sometimes cited. The book is written in an easy-to-read style, but some may find it difficult to read because of the wealth of detail. Sometimes, it is hard to keep the various clusters straight, particularly in the first few chapters when Weiss refers to them without defining them. However, definition is difficult. These groups are composed of many characteristics, as becomes clear in the last chapter describing the United States' 62 clusters. We [...] recommend this book to those in management or marketing who are developing products, services, and programs for particular niche groups."
5,Wonderful book to go with the song!,"We bought this book for our 8 month old son around the holidays. He loved looking at the pictures as we sang Deck the Halls. Typical of Sylvia Long's work, the illustrations are very detailed and are very engaging to both children and adults alike. When we were not reading the book, we kept it on display on the piano, making a great decoration, as well! I can't wait to pull it out during the holidays next year!"
2,Lost interest,I had higher expectations for this book. However I just lost interest - I suppose it was too easy to see what was going to transpire. The story to me just fell flat and slowly stopped moving.
4,"Nice product, but pricy.","I meant to order the Styling CREAM, but ordered the LOTION in error. (""Lotion"" is more descriptive of the ""Cream"") This product is a watery styler (thus my misunderstanding). Thought I'd try it, as shipping changes the dynamics of an exchange. It does a nice job, is light-weight, but you have to use more product. The result is nice body and natural shine. (With the Cream, you use less, but there is a heavier, dry, dullness.) As both products are pricy for what they are, I will probably save this Lotion for special occasions, as I do the Cream."
4,Great for fine hair,"I have short, very fine hair and have found that this B&B styling lotion helps give me some body without the wieghing my hair down. I've tried using several other products but keep coming back to this styling lotion (which is kind of a misnomer since it's a light spray). I don't like the feel of heavy product or hair that is stiff so this works great."
2,Yuck...,"I have long hair and had high hopes for a miracle when I bought this product. I was looking for something that would smooth out my crazy frizzies and make my hair look more sleek. Maybe it's just me, but I followed the instructions on the bottle and something went very wrong. My hair became sticky and I could barely pull my brush through without extreme pain. The lotion did make my hair a little less frizzy, but I was expecting dramatic results for product that is popular and much more costly than other brands. I used up quite a bit of the product trying to acheive the results that were advertised. Unfortunately it never happened. It may work on different types of hair though."
1,This book should be called - I hate my children,Seriously? Seriously? Grow up and move on. Get a hobby. Find a good therapist. I only hope your children and the children of others aren't privy to this. The only people you hurt in divorce with nasty behavior like this is your children.
4,Very funny!,"I had a hard time putting the book down. It made me realize that I am not alone - there are other women dealing with the mistake they married. The stories were so funny. After some stories I had to say, ""Girlfriend, you go girl!"""
5,Smart and Tasty,"What has to be the most original concept for an erotic anthology, 'The Best of the Best Meat Erotica' will have your begging for seconds. Each story brings you meat-laced erotica you've never even fantasized about, but will add some new ideas to your bedroom role-playing. All of the up-and-coming writers contained here dare to cross the line, and deliver, with notable contributions from Lammie winner Ian Philips, Marshall Moore, and Steve Berman. Something for everyone's palate."
1,Badly written and full of misinformation.,"This is a terribly bad book. It is full of factually incorrect assertions woven together into a distorted picture of the most influential and complex theater worker of the twentieth century. There is a total absence of critical perception or analysis, and for someone who claims to have been working so long in the field, Fuegi betrays a remarkable lack of insight into the dynamics of theater production. He pays lip-service to what he seems to believe are feminist principles, but underneath them, he shows great disregard for the opinions and achievements of the remarkable women who worked with Brecht throughout his life. Fuegi seems to have learned nothing from Brecht;his writing is plodding and turgid - all the more so in the context of Brecht's own sharpness and economy of language. Any other book on Brecht would provide a better introduction; I have only given it one star because I can't figure out how to give it less"
1,Beware!,Battery did not fit and would not make contact with the connector. Tech support and customer service is non-existent... Never saw it this bad. Multiple calls and emails and no response.
4,great story!,"The book is a great story for pupils in the 8th or 9th grade.If you read the book you will tend to put yourself in the shoes of the main character and think a lot about what you would do in her situation.The story is about a girl, that is blackmailed by a tough guy with friends in every positions and you get to know about her thoughts and feelings.It`s not a misterious story but a realistic story that shows a life of a normal American girl, who goes to High School. That girl called Cathy is under a lot of pressure in a really difficult situation.You can`t stop reading the book because there are many changes so you want to know how the story continues.The author uses a lot of new vocabularies so it isn`t a boring story, but fun to read it.I would recommend the book to other pupils because it isn`t a fantasy story, but a story you make up your mind about."
2,Occasionally infuriating but mostly disappointing,"First of all, as a non-Wiccan Pagan, I am SO sick and tired of people automatically equating (Neo-)Pagan or Witch with Wicca that I could just scream.Second, this reads like someone's graduate-school thesis, heavy on the academic citations and sociological jargon and light on readability. I minored in anthropology at university and still found it pretty chewy at points.Third, extrapolating the _entire_ Pagan community from a very limited sample (virtually all Wiccan), in my opinion, utterly ridiculous. Certainly it isn't going to tell anyone much about actually _practicing_ the religion, so don't plan on reading it for that purpose. (It will, however, give an all-too-clear view of the backbiting, sniping, and passive-agressive behavior all too common in the Wiccan community. Sigh.)"
2,Not very good,"For some reason this band has become VERY popular (almost to the extent of Atreyu)... yet, i do not know why. There is nothing special baout these guys, I've heard all of it before. They are very repetitive and it gets rather boring. The screamer is alright, but not very original. So in short, don't buy it and waste your money"
5,Great improvement,"Frail Words Collapse was definately an amazing album and left me in awe after listening. Shadows are Security feeds off FWC's intensity and improves it over and over. Though I dislike it when heavy bands add more singing (b/c it usually loses the original sound I've come to enjoy), AILD's added singing just builds the intensity even more. Their songs are much more structured than FWC, and the lyrics have also improved. The vocals are basically the same, but the screams do have a little more variety. I would most definately recommend this album to those who enjoyed FWC, as well as most fans of The Agony Scene, Still Remains, UnderOath, and Killswitch Engage."
4,Way better than I thought it would be,"Every new ""metalcore"" cd that comes out scares me. As someone who enjoyed the scene, it seems that many new albums have dissapointed me. The new Agony Scene is a good example of a once good band adopting a more formulaic approach of songwritting. So when As I Lay Dying came out with a new cd, I had my doubts. Turns out there was no reason to. While this cd doesn't break any new musical ground, it definately perfects what As I Lay Dying was trying to do on their first cd. With almost an entirely new line up, the guitar work has improved vastly. Tracks like ""Reflection"" and ""The Truth of My Perception"" are punishing sonic assaults with intricate melodic guitar lines. With the bassist now handling the melodic vocals, a metalcore band actually sings and doesn't have come off as cheesy. He shows their new dynamic in ""Confined"" and ""The Darkest Nights."" If you are a fan of metalcore, this is a definate must buy."
5,Improvement,"I liked this album better than FWC. The songs tend to stand out more, and the band actually throws in a solo on ""Empty Hearts"". Don't let any of the lyrics fool you. And quit calling this emo, people. Go to four.fa if you want to know what emo is. Besides, there's only singing in 3 of the songs (""Confined"", ""The Darkest Nights"" and ""Through Struggle"").Even with 3/5 of a lineup change, the band didn't slip at all. Maybe it's because Tim and Jordan stayed in the band, as they are the main elements.Overall, if you're wanting a ""metalcore"" release that doesn't sound very outdated, I recommend this. It just amazes me how a band like As I Lay Dying can really stand out in a genre like this."
4,Good album but to the kid reviewer below,"Now kid, you probably are just getting into this ""scene"" but, As I Lay Dying is faaaaaaaaaaaar from emo ok? This is flat out metal. From First To Last or new Underoath that's emo. Metal is bands like AILD, Between The Buried and Me, Living Sacrifice, Underoath before They're Only Chasing Safety. Hope this explained something to you and if you're doing this just to be sarcastic, don't do it because you'll get tons of metal kids on your arse quicker than flies on crap k?"
5,Classic Colour blind love story,"Forget the obvious. This story is from the mid 60s and the world was a different place then from today. This movie is strong and moving because of the flawless performances of Hepburn and Tracy, slowly realizing that their morality which they have taught their daughter from the beginning was making a mockery of them. The realization of their shallow lip-service to civil rights only comes through hard confrontation with the reality that they have nothing to do. Poitier's speach to his father ""I don't owe you"" adeptly sets the stage for Tracy's brilliant monolog. A must have classic."
1,most dated movie ever made,The whole story of this film was good only for one year. I mean my child brought sp. back as her potental husband. I would proceed at all possible speed to lock him in a room and run not walk to the nearest judge and get the marige done on the spot
1,Save your money,This stuff smells like cheap Drakkar noir..not unpleasant but cheaply done. Very poor quality product. Gave mine to a friend.
1,Does NOT fit the 4GB IPod,"It's marketed as a 4GB skin, but it does not fit at all. I returned them as soon as I got them. Very disappointing."
5,Her Best,"I was recommended this album by a young woman from Brazil at a kd Lang concert. I have since bought her other two albums availble here as well; Outra Luz and Sortimento, but it is to Intimidade that I keep being drawn back. First off let me state that I don't understand a word of what Zelia is singing - so I am only affected by the way she expresses it. The music on Intimidade is somewhat experimental with some great musicians and songs that seem to be trying to find a unique sound. Outra Luz (her first album) is a much more traditional Brazilian Pop Album. I recently received Sortimento and maybe expecting a further departure - was somewhat dissapointed - but it is still a very good recording.If you are not at all familiar with Zelia Duncan I would recommend her albums in this order:1. Intimidade (between the other two)2. Sortimento (2001)3. Outra Luz (1990?)- which is under a different name - Zelia Cristina."
2,Not Immolation's Best!,"Here we are again. I wanted to review this disk again and give it another chance due to all negative feedback from my first review. The second time around is still not the charm for me. While I really like the new album (Harnessing Ruin) and Unholy Cult, this album is just boring. I saw Immolation live in Sac Town and they can produce a lot of noise on stage. They are a band you really have to pay attention too while listening to their music. I will give 2 stars and leave it at that. That's 1 more star than last time because I found at least 1 track that was memorable. This is by no means Immolation's best work."
1,Not Romance,This movie was one of the worst movies me and my brother watched by far. Some people might like it but to us. IT plain sucked.
1,La stupidite et rien d'autre !,"What is this for heaven's sake ? It is so annoying that it suffocates you! Catherine Breillat should have spent more attention to character development than the ""fashionable"" costumes of her protagonist(or whatever the heck she was). Reviews said that it was the most erotic film ever. But in fact it's the most neurotic! This is pretentiousness at its tops! Avoid it at the cost of your life!"
3,An Original Look,"The film is undeniably graphic and blunt, and while I can't say I enjoyed it all that much, there's a great deal of depth in the material. The actors/actresses bare all and do all in this film, and I appreciated the fact that there is no sugar-coating in the plot. The film is worth a look, but only for the mature audience!"
1,Not what I thought...,"This was basically porn with a story line. If you have interests in a film beyond that particular premise, I suggest you steer clear of this one."
2,Pretentious,"The cover's sub-text states (a) love is desolate, (b) romance is temporary and (c) sex is forever. To me, this is pretentious. It suggests either a degree of titillation (placing emphasis on the sex) or a complete lack of belief in the emotional conditions of 'romance' and 'love'. What is in the film's favour is that (as in my other reviews of similar movies), the female perspective is worthy of exploration. The theme is one of unrequited love and desire from the man she clearly loves. This sends her to alternative erotic scenarios. If you want explicit sex, there's not much here, compared to others in the genre. An understanding of emotional and sexual disappointment is attempted.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
1,and the point was?,"I watched the ""edited"" version on video. Perhaps the unedited would have made it more interesting. Needless to say, this was one screwed up, insecure woman who played her own games as much as the boyfriend she so wanted. I could NOT relate to her. There really was no plot. Her whinning soul-searching and her ""intuition"" about men and their dastardly wants started to drive me buggy. She should've dumped the SOB a long time ago. The end of the movie sideblinding me like a drunk driver - it came out of nowhere. I didn't get the artsy part of the flick and I didn't see what ANY of it had to do with female sexuality. Guys, if you decide to watch Romance, please don't think this movie is a model to all womens inner thoughts. I'd stay away from this self-destructive chick, and this movie."
1,Pass,"The only possible use for this movie would be to use it as a litmus test for potential lovers. If they like it, run.The central character needs to punish herself for the sexual ambiguity of her partner. After wandering through ""relationships"" with a total stranger, a sadist, then a rapist, she murders her partner and gives birth to his son.This is NOT a ""chick flick."""
2,Not recommended,"This was a frustrating book to read. The author would mention a topic briefly in one paragraph, just enough to confuse me, only to ""introduce"" it and fully discuss it in future paragraphs as if it had never been mentioned before. If I had to guess, I would say it was written and edited in parts and never looked at as a whole to ensure that it flowed in a way that made sense."
3,hmmm,"I love Today is the Day. every record is unique and interesting. It's catchy yet dissonant. Kiss the pig is the worst record of their history in my opinion. It's not bad, but it's just not as good as anything else they've done. It's really boring. I hate blast beats and grindcore beats. TITD's drummers in the past did not do that crap. They played technically proficient groove/jazzy beats. grind beats have no feeling and maybe thats why this new Today is the Day record has no feeling. It seems like it was just thrown together. I'm dissapointed. Everything they have ever done is amazing. This record just doesnt hold up. Buy WILLPOWER or IN THE EYES OF GOD."
3,"Worth the read, but not as helpful as expected","The stories shared in this book definitely let girls who are being bullied know they are not alone. In that respect it is helpful. However, it doesn't really contain any information in how to deal with female aggression. I also maybe would have liked to read more success stories from girls that had been bullied and are now leading productive and happy lives."
4,Very Good Reading,"Black Church Beginnings by Henry H.Mitchell was very good reading. It was very easy to read inspite of the fact that a lot of history is used. I found the book to be insightful and inspiring.I did not care for the condition of the book which had a susbstantial amount of underline markings. Which in some cases made it difficult to identify what I thought was important as opposed to the previous owners perception.However ""B.C.B.,"" was intertaining and I would recommnend the book to anyone interested in knowing the history of black churches."
3,The Life of a useless man,"i found the book rather good, it was a little strange though as i felt that there should have been more to the story and the it ended too quickly, although it did feel rather good at the end to be able to say i had finished the book, i feel although not every one might enjoy the book, it is one which should be read."
4,Simply Amazing,"This album is one of the best albums i've had the pleasure of listening too. Imagine a choir flowing over a notorious B.I.G beat, this album has it. Imagine smooth singing over Teddy Riley type tracks, this albums has it. Almost every track has a catchy hook and the songwriting is amazing. Once u hear this album, u will ""love pumping gospel music."""
5,SOME SERIOUS SH**,"I didn't know who this was when I bought it but thank goodness I did buy it. Exactly what others said: Portishead meets Massive Attack meets Craig Armstrong. Very expansive soundscapes, sometimes harsh, balanced by the voice of an angel. The overall mood is dark and semi-depressing but weirdly, at the same time, uplifting. You have to listen to it to understand it."
5,Timeless,"Sometimes you find a group of songs that create ""that"" kind of moments. For example, each time I listen to ""pilots"" (and mostly, all of the songs in this album) something beautiful is happening. It doesn't matter if I am at work or if I am just staring at the skies.I had this one since its release date. But haven't pay enough attention until a couple of years after. I guess you have to find the right moment to enjoy it.Sometimes I wish ""Black Cherry"" and ""Supernature"" where as fine as this one."
5,Must Have for Guitar Lovers,This is a must have CD if your a guitar fan !!One of the best underated guitar player on the planet just amazing to see live.This CD is mostly all Chicago Style Blues based Mostly all written by Jerry Miller a great Cd all the way through but a couple stand outs here are Now I See with an Amazing guitar solo.and Thats All Right hard to believe this guy is not better known then he is.This cd is not much at all like Moby Grape if thats what your looking for Jerry has always even in those days been much more into the blues rock style then where Moby Grape came from.
5,Jerry Miller,"In the early 60's when my tour of duty was over in Germany I met Bob Mosley while attending San Diego City College. He played in local bands and then left to San Francisco. As you probably know, Moby Grape was a top band then. I recently saw Jerry Millers name on CD now and decided to buy it. Best CD I own. The man is fantastic. The song; Now I see, is especially fine. I recommend this CD to all who love good and real blues."
2,"Comfortable, Good Sound, but Useless!","This unit would NOT stay paired to my phone, but kept coming un-paired when on standby. This completely defeats the purpose of having a BT headset since you have to reactivate the connection every time you want to make a call or answer the phone.It was so comfortable I didn't know it was there and had great sound quality. If not for the ""Fatal Flaw"" it would get 5 stars."
3,"Good Sound, lousy for those with glasses",This product produces great sound quality and fits well on the ear but is horrible to use and nearly impossible if you wear glasses. Ended up giving it to my 13 year old daughter and buying a different one that will stay on while wearing glasses.
4,Invaluable film for South Africa,"The South African Constitution has been justifiably lauded as one of the best examples of a modern liberal constitution, with not only minority rights entrenched therein, but also gay rights. When one looks at the lack of tolerance of gays on most of the African continent, notably just north of South Africa in Zimbabwe, then the importance of this film cannot be over-estimated. It might not suit some of those in power now in South Africa, but gays are a part of South African life, have always been a part of South African life and always will be a part of the rainbow nation. The film is also very well made and quite amusing.Chris Fannin, Switzerland, former president of the Anti-Apartheid movement, Switzerland"
1,be careful before buying !!!,I bought this item after checking dimensions to be sure it would fit in my standard base sink cabinet. Upon receipt I learned that you need a significantly larger opening that the dimensions indicate for the cabinet to open and close !!
5,this product is the perfect thing for any kitchen,received my product & it is just what I wanted. it uses shopping bags that you usually throw away. & keeps it behind cuboard doors
2,Not a big fan,"Good idea but just didn't work well cause the bags and the trash system are too small for my kitchen. It's built well and probably would be OK for a single person with a small kitchen. I returned it and I had to pay for shipping so I made a bad purchase. Oh well, you win some and lose some."
4,"A mixed (body) bag,,,","I found this show by accident and was pretty damned impressed. The video format makes it look low-budget but they tell the stories very well; there are a few lousy stories but the good ones make up for it...""Be Movie"", ""Eater"", ""Boy's Club"", ""The One Where"", ""Ritual Slaughter"" are really cool shorts. I'd get both seasons to cover all the bases."
3,Unique educational video,"This video is somewhat dated visually, but has some good tips for those looking to expand their definition of sex and orgasm. Unfortunately there is some weird high pitched music on and off throughout the movie that detracts from the video. I would suggest this video is you are looking for something different from mainstream adult films and enjoy a variety of female body types. Main feature is only about 45 minutes. There is also a bonus video of zen meditations on the female anatomy that I have seen sold separately as its own video."
3,Dams is still finding her style,"This story was good and complete, but seems like the author s still finding her style. The later books in this series are much better than this one."
4,"Silky, light and moisturizing",Love this lotion. Smells great! It it very silky and goes on smooth but it moisturizes well. Good for every day use. I prefer Auquaphor for rashes or super dryness.
4,Great book that gives you Alan's insight on the consulting process,"This is the third of Alan Weiss's book on consulting and one that fills in the gaps for me. Alan is a believer in working with the customer and jointly arrive at a solution or a process to implement. This is a key for his success and one that he expounds for all consultants to follow. Most big consulting firms have a canned program to solving the customers ""problems"" and most of the time, it does not really solve the problem. Alan's approach is one of truly finding the client's needs and then solving it.Since I never worked as a consultant before, I needed some idea of some of the tools that Alan uses. This book provides his tools which I lacked in reading his first two books, Million Dollar Consulting and Getting Started in Consulting. However, I dont want to be caught up in the mechanics of the process less I fall into the same trap that the big firms are pursuing. Thank you Alan."
2,better hikes on your own,"disappointing hiking book. mostly small easy hike, short in lenth. NOT for the better hikers who want long hikes. Most of these hikes are just a bit better than a walk in the park."
2,Dog toy,I thought this would be strong enough for my westie but no he had a hole in it with in 5 minutes. Buying this toy was a waste of money for me.
5,kong air dog squeaker football dog toy large yellow,i have a big dog that absolutely loves squeaky toys and her favorite thing to do is play ball as much as possible this toy is just awesome for her. anyone that loves their dog will love this toy.
5,KONG Football Dog Toy,"Very durable, and the pooch loves the squeaker! The way the football bounces gives him extra exercise as it is an unpredictable direction. I'd buy another when he wears this one out."
2,Too small,"I love Kong products. However, the Air Dog Squeaker Football (Medium) was just too small for my two Labs. I purchased a ""medium"" thinking it was the same size as the one they were already enjoying together. When it arrived, I was very disappointed in the small (medium) size. I even checked my order to see if I had purchased the wrong one. They do not play with this one like the first one due to the fact that it is smaller. That doesn't mean I wouldn't purchase another; next time it will be the ""large!"""
2,It's not a good ball for tuff dogs,I've bought 2 football squeakers for my rottweilers. They chewed the cover in 2 days and the rubber inside in more 1 day. And I still have to pay the credit card...
2,Just a ball,"I was very disappointed with this ball. The squeaker broke within 5 minutes of play, and then it was just a ball to our dog. He lost interest right away then. I have purchashed other Kong Squeaker items, and they lasted a lot longer. Would not purchse the football."
3,dog loved it for 3 hours,"1 year old lab ate through it in 3 hours, but he was very happy for those 3 hours. It is a sturdy toy, but nothing is strong enough for puppy destructo."
1,Lasted for 30 minutes,We have a Weimaraner and she chewed this up in 30 minutes into pieces. First she got the squeaker out and then everything was just history. I do not recommend this for a Medium to large dog who is an agressive chewer. And this is NOT made by KONG. It is very cheaply made and it is NOT worth the money at all...
3,Deluxe Toddler Racer,IT'S FINE EXCEPT FOR THAT MY DAUGHTER KEEPS PULLING OFF THE WHEEL OTHER WISE IT IS GREAT.
3,slow leak,My son loves it but there must be a defect in them because ours too has a slow leak and we have to blow it up every time we use it.
2,disappointed,"I received this tube after searching for a while on the internet and reading its reviews. It had a hole in it before I even used it. My son (21mths) has used it one time ! Luckily it was purchased at the end of the summer. In the meantime, I will have to find the hole to patch it up. Many other reviewers said the same about it having a hole but I was hoping to beat the odds........I will never order from that manufacturer again !"
3,There's better out there,"The first couple of tracks and the last two are OK.That's two thirds of the cd going by time.Four tracks out of seven.I must say it sounds better each time I play it,but I don't bother with those three middle tracks.Better to buy Africando/Mandali[Afro/salsa] or Koffi Olomide/African Classics[nice African music]MandaliAfrican Classics"
1,Poor explanation,I bought this DVD as a true beginner to Pilates. I'm not out of shape or overweight but I want to make sure I'm doing the moves correctly so I can reap the full benefits of Pilates with out the cost of a class. I really disliked this DVD. The instructor was not annoying but the filming was. It seemed like they were more focused on showing you the surrounding birds and flowers then the instructor. What I was looking for was a nice and slow DVD that stayed focused on the instructor so I could watch her the whole time while trying to figure out how and what she was doing. Unfortunately I didn't get that with this DVD.
5,Warn 28751 Standard Manual Hub Kit,"Works great as a replacement of the original hubs on my 1985 Jeep CJ7.Install was straightforward and didn't take long at all (and I'm a novice/weekend warrior mechanic-type).I've used them this year several times in the ice/snow and they worked great. Especially in a good 10""+ of snow driving home one night. Got to the parking lot after work one evening and the snow had been falling hard for several hours. Started the jeep, locked the new Warn hubs, brushed the snow of the jeep, and drove out of the parking lot with no troubles at all.Have yet to use them off-roading - hope to get to that this spring/summer!!Well-made and easy to install...great product!"
5,Laughing to the point of tears!!,I'm a fan... and this book just gave me 100 more reasons why I love Lewis!!! I was literally laughing out loud and crying throughout the entire book!!! I was way beyond my expectations!!!
5,A great funny read.,I like Lewis Black. But so often something is lost when a stand up comedian writes a book. This is not the case with this book. I laughed and had a great time reading it.
4,Lewis can write,"Lewis Black' intelligence and writing ability come through in this book. Being a contemporary, I fully appreciated his historic perspectives."
2,Stand ups should stay standing.,"I like Lewis Black's comedy a lot. He's one of those people who have no problem pointing out nonsense and making fun of it. He should, however, give up reading his own books aloud and putting this rambling on cd. It's horrible. I haven't read the book, and I won't be doing so. It's just Lewis rambling on from subject to subject with no real point--and it's almost entirely boring. Maybe reading the book would have been a better choice, I'll never know. It should have been titled _A Whole Bunch of Nothing--with No Fricking Point_ . It's like Cheney trying to do stand up--except I think people would actually laugh at Cheney (you don't think you would?). Anyway, Lewis, love ya, but stick to stand up and give my money back, and give me the time spent waiting for something to come off this disc that was more than vaguely humorous or intriguing or something, anything. Ten thumbs down. You get two stars just because it's you, and that's it."
1,Bored by Black,"I usually howl at Black's comedy but was disappointed by the book and the audio. I am returning the book since I can't return the audio. Black reads the book in a very boring way. Most of the material you have heard somewhere else. Please get back on track, Lewis, since this country desperately needs your humorous advice."
4,Sharpening the Skewers For Academe,"Some of my favorite things to find in mystery fiction are wit and heart, and LITTLE MISS EVIL has both. When the State University of Michigan brings on board Camille Cypriani, a vituperative best-selling author, offering her an exorbitant salary for virtually no work, there isn't an unruffled feather left in the department. Nick Hoffman, the series sleuth who slogs away teaching composition at SUM, has to sort through university politics, department egos, a creepy campaign of intimidation against himself -- and murder. Lev Raphael has an exceptionally fine, droll style he applies with real insight into life both on and off the college campus."
1,"Bad form, and Nick always had good!","I didn't even make it past the first three chapters. The author's constant remarks about how over-weight this character was or how ugly this other one is made it a real drag. Why bring a mystery down to the level of insulting it reader's intelligence with diatribes about your stand point on what is ""beauty."" It's a mystery novel.Of course from what I've read in the other reviews no real mystery happens. I know I wont purchase any further Nick novels... try Grant Michaels series about Stan Kraychik. So much better than Mr. Raphael's latest offerings."
5,A Hoot,"Raphael's latest is an absolute joy to read. There are actually two mysteries in this book and both are fun. Of course you know who's going to get killed, but that's a classic device in mysteries. What's different is staging the killing late, and what a treat to see that, since there's nothing more cliched than a first-page corpse. The rap-up is a hilarious spoof of all those revelation scenes where the detective Tells All. I don't read mysteries for fiendish plots, but for character, setting and atmosphere--and this one is a knockout in all categories."
5,Wonderful!,"A book which grabs your attention immediately! Your heart stays with Abby as she matures from twelve to fifteen, in a household going through difficult times. Older readers (like me) will relate to the references to times past, when a dishwasher was a huge deal! Unique style and voice make for an easy, but captivating, read."
3,"Didn't Hate it, yet Didn't Love it","I was a good book, but it wasn't one I would read again. I'm glad I got it at the library. The actual story was good but very sad. But if you don't like to curse words or taking the Lord's name in vain don't read it and I'm not talking about ""shut up"" or ""crap"" or any other ""baby"" cuss words I talking about real cussing. I wouldn't read it again because I HATED the writing style! There were absolutely NO quotation marks so you would never know if someone was talking or thinking, and almost 1/2 the chapters began with the word ""so"" (for example ""So I was walking home from school one day..."", ""So Dad came home...""), and the weirdamundo and all the ""amundo"" words got on my nerves after about the 3rd time."
2,Not textured or complex enough for adults.,"I was disappointed that our library chose this book to be read and discussed. I might recommend it to someone fourteen or under, but I think it's neither textured nor complex enough for adults."
1,Boring,"A basic description:This is several scenes of the camera simply panning over women wearing things like bathing suits, no story or anything like that. Which I don't have any problem with.Why I don't like it:If you like the sort of women who have more silicon than brains, who look like their faces and really their entire bodies are made out of plastic, than this might be your thing. Personally I would have been less bored watching paint peel."
2,More of the same thing...,"Although great talent, same music, same lyrics than Buena Vista Social Club, not even close to be original."
3,Excellent Academic Writing,Seems to be excellent academic writing from someone who doesn't know about real magic.
2,Could have been better,"This bio was missing a lot--eg, Toscanini quietly said Bravo when he heard Chaliapin sing in rehearsal--and said Chaliapin was the most talented singer he had ever meet--Chaliapin bombed in the US because of his too-realistic behavior in Barber of Seville--other opera singers were astonished at his acting ability--and his friendship with Rachmaninoff was just about unique in friendships between men--and what about his visit to Tolstoy with Rachmaninoff?"
2,Not the best book on choosing a dog breed.,"The authors (dog trainers) seem to promote the sterotypes for several of the breeds described in the book. The primary sources of related experiences seem to be with animals with problem owners rather than animals from well adjusted owners/families. Having owned or grown up with many of the breeds described in the book, I can only say that the breed descriptions in this book are often slanted toward the ill-adjusted / ill-breed end of the breed spectrum.For a better guide look at The Right Dog for You by Daniel Tortora"
4,"Cancer : ""Death Shall Rise""","Very solid Death Metal. They sound very similar to Malevolent Creation at times. It's just straight forward Death Metal. No ground breaking here at all, just solid old-school Death Metal at it's best....James Murphy on axe duties does this justice.....If you like Death, Malevolent Creation, Massacre, and other Tampa Bay area based outfits, you'll enjoy this as well...."
1,Cancer- its more than just a fatal illness.,"I thought I'd heard it all and then bam! Cancer hits with the power of a nine year old bully. Their album reminds me a lot of >INSERT TERRIBLE METAL BAND HERE< without all the biting originality. Cancer's lyrics touch on topics important to all Americans such as decomposing corpses, burning flesh, zombies, amputation, decapitation, pus, sores, scabs, and stagflation in developing economies. All in all, if you've got enough money to buy Cancer albums, do everyone a favor, and donate your hard earned buck to cancer research instead."
4,jkhasdkgh,I really enjoyed this book. I recommend to anyone looking for a good read. I am not much of a reader but was drawn to this book for some odd reason.
5,nice sound for a cheap price,"I have bought 2 of these, along with a 400-watt Pyle amplifier and the sound is absolutely awesome. I never thought you could get such great sound from something so cheap, but this sub tube is great and I would most definitely recommend it"
1,Warning do not buy this item,"I recently purchased this sub tube and it blew out the same day, about 1 hour of play time. My 6"" Polk book shelf speaker has performed better for 4 months prior to putting this on my system."
5,Nice Addition for the low low!!,"I'm not into ""ground-shattering"" sound so to speak, I enjoy music, I enjoy a balance of the highs lows and mids; I got this sub to hit some lows that my car 6 x 9's couldn't pick and since my car stereo has an in-built amplifier, I didn't need to buy one or attempt any fancy wiring.I got this item on sale from amazon at $35 inclusive of shipping. Decided that if it wasn't good enough I'd just add an amplifier or sell.I'm enjoying the medium bass (It's been about 1 month) good addition to my car and simple wiring from car speakers; word of caution, do NOT mix +ve and -ve poles, get 'em right it might save you some trouble or a shot from happening if you're trying to combine/bridge speaker outputs to lead into this one. Here's a link to check out which speaker wires are +ve or -ve for your car for free: http://www.the12volt.com/Thanks Amazon and Pyle,Happy customer :)"
2,Weak,"Can't handle more than 300 watts...at best. And the bass is weak, I can get more bass from my 6x9s."
1,do not buy!!,i installed this sub with a 350watt kenwood amp. it lasted about 5 minutes before completely popping. not worth the money
5,Totally Amazing,"What an amazing dvd this is,words cannot describe it only the music and video can.This is a diamond in the rough and if you love music this is a must.What ever I write cannot do justice to this dvd.It connects with your unconscious booming and throbbing into your heart,mind, vision and soul. IN megamix,which goes on and on leading you to another world or a glimpse of another dimension, throws one mandela forms after another at the veiwer. This all makes for a pleasant day. I recommend getting a set of prism glasses (like are enclosed in ""Sidney's psychedelic adventure"" titled HEADCANDY (DVD) to view megamix, but it is great without it too."
2,"Missing the Mark, and hitting my wallet!","1. Where was the SouthSide video on this DVD? That's why I bought the DVD, and one of his biggest bestest video's is missing in action, nowhere to be found on this DVD. The only 'southside' clip on this DVD are a couple of 'very bad' remixes.2. Several of the older vids/mixes have terrible pops and clicks from the 'vinel' records used for some of the mixes. A higher bit of quality control and clean-up would have prevented this. Please don't tell me I spent 2K on a video/audio system to hear that 'snap crackle pop' as clear as a bell. DUH!3. None of the older videos have been cleaned up. There was quite a bit of 'video noise' and sad color saturation that just blew this DVD out of the running as anything other than marketing hype.4. I'm sad that ""MOBY"" didn't take a greater interest in this DVD, other than to help sweep more tape off the cutting room floor!"
3,"Meh, it's o.k.",This would be for hardcore Moby fans really. This could've been better. A more complete full length concert would've made it better.The extras were just o.k.Nothing major.
1,Over rated,The incredible blurbs on the back cover of the book promise a book of great hilarity and insight. The bleak truth is that it contains very little of either. An obsessive self interest and self absorbtion drowns out any sympathy that you might want to give to Oliver Walzer. The star table tennis player schtick (borrowed from Forrest Gump) is extraordinarily tiring --you wanted to clout both central character and author with a racquet or something and have them wake up and talk about something else.This is a shame because I thought the current hype around his latest book was genuine discovery of a new voice. I have enjoyed other books of his and hope that he regained some touch in his most recent novel.
4,This is one great CD.,"I love this CD and all the great songs on it. One of the reviewers said that Iggy Pop ripped the bassline off of one of the songs, but I wanna Be your Dog was released almost ten years before this album was. I guess that guy has no idea what he is talking about. Good CD."
5,Citizen King fan from Milwaukee,"I've loved Citizen King for years, but this is their best CD. The greatest part- they are from Milwaukee too. They are great in concert, and if you can, see them."
5,This cd is GREAT,I just got this cd and dont regret it one bit. I love it. It sure was worth it. BUY THIS CD NOW! U WILL LOVE IT!!
5,The best!,"If you do hair like myself, then do yourself a favor and buy this edger! It will be the only one you need. If you properly care for it, will last you for years! I tried a cordless one but they never have the same power or results that the T-Edger does. Great buy for the price!"
5,Good purchase,"I will advice anyone to invest in this clipper. It saves you money on shaving sticks and low quality clippers. I ordered this clipper from amazon including the andis cool care plus, all in one coolant, disinfectant, lubricator, cleaner, and rust preventive. The blade is gentle on the skin so you wont be getting razor bumps. Its does not get too hot and its lighter than I thought. Its really been great so far. I will give it a 100% but again lets see how long last for."
5,Great trimmer,"This is the best trimmer I've ever owned. I use it to trim my facial hair and hair line to create crisp, clean lines. The only draw back was that I had to take the blade off to adjust it to cut closer. It cut to my satisfaction once the blade was adjusted."
4,SWAG,This is an excellent t liner very sharp and gives me a stupid straight line up. I strongly recommend to those who cant afford the barbershop!!!!
2,Dull Bllade,"after unpacking then tryin to use it wouldnt shave because the blade is dull. Unfortunate for me i live in the caribbean so shipping it back would be to expensive so i had to order new blades which would b cheaper for me.However, the machine was quiet when tried to use it and did not over heat like some people was saying."
5,still ticking,I purchased this product a while back hoping that I would not have to buy another one. So far everything is going according to plan. I use this t-liner regularly and I still get the same spot on finish. Great buy!
3,clipper,When I ordered this product I thought it was going to be a closer cut but all in all it was worth it. Unfortunately my 8 month old pulled it down from sink and broke the tip of it now I got to buy some more
3,Self titled,"RHYTHM OF THE STREET is one my favourite song of Patti! Tracks 1 and 7 are also really good, but the rest of the album is not to remember for me. The album is produced by Quincy Jones, Narada Michael Walden, David Pack, Glen Ballard & Clif Magness, and Ollie E. Brown."
1,Absolute crap,"Boy, this band is overrated. Just because they have a pretty lead singer, they get to be on Ozzfest and in every rock/metal magazine? I bought this cd out of curiosity-Big Mistake!! The band sounds like they just learned how to play their instruments last month. There are absolutely no riffs, just bar chords chugging along very uninspiredly, backed up by Casio-sounding keyboards. Kinda sounds like Europe (remember ""The Final Countdown""?) with a (more) female singer. Don't waste your time. Makes a great coaster, though!"
3,Tine for the Requisite...,"...Evanescence comparison, though without the former's emotional wreckage. A little more on the metal side than Evanescence, though, and this is what detracts for me. But if you Like traditional metal...they've got some nice things going on. I just kind of wish they'd leave the vocals to the female. Nice layering of melodies, and there's some diverse experimenting peeking through that needs to be followed through with, showing promise."
5,love it,it compares to evanescence but i love amy lee with a passion. I wish that Lacuna Coil was bigger in the U.s because i would have found them out sooner. The lead girl singer had an amazing voice. The guy's voice isn't as great....at all but gives it a rougher sound. Overall i enjoyed it and look for more out of them
3,Overrated,"This album is sooo highly overrated it's not even funny. People are always raving about how excellent or amazing this album is and saying wonderful things, when it actually isn't that great. Most of the songs aren't very good and it's boring. It's boring!!I gave this album 3 stars. Swamped,Heaven's a Lie,Tight Rope, Entwined and Angel's Punishment are good songs. The only good songs off this album. So that makes it 5/13, which isn't good really. Also, Andrea sounds pretty good here, which is good. But i still think they should lose him.The genre. This is band is usually labled as gothic metal. I disagree abou this ""metal"" thing. They're music isn't really metal, it's more rock. Gothic rock is what i'll call this band, but who caresSo overall, this is OKAY, but not excellent like everyone says *rolls eyes*.I have recommendations. Lacuna Coil's first album,In a Reverie, i thnk is a GREAT album. Sooo much better than this Comalies. And so on(...)"
2,Female vocals drowned out by bad mix,"I had high hopes for this album, but the mix is not very good. The female vocals often come out as vague vowel sounds and the male vocals are lackluster. The songs have simple setups and melodies and is, overall, uninventive. The only song which shows promise is ""Aeon"" and they chop that one short. Sorry, this band is mediocre."
3,hmmmm....,good music...hot lead singer...but i'm just not into the female vocals...if you like evanescence hehehe you'll like this...
2,Cannot hold a candle to Evanescence,"This band has potential if they could record better songs. We need a few more female singers in Rock 'n Roll but there's no way in Hell that this girl or this band is even close to the talent of the band ""Evanescence."" The song Heaven is a Lie is about as close to a good song as these guys can get. The recording has that Janet Jackson Mish Mash where there is a lot of ground noise.....not a lot of differentiation of the instruments. The used CD stores should have a bunch of these CDs for less than $4.99 I hope this band will get rid of the male singer's influence and concentrate on writing good rock and roll and featuring the female voice in the band a lot more.10/21/11 - additional comments. LOL@the Coil lovers....this band makes albums with one good song and the rest are really hurtin'. I stand by my comments....Coil needs to ditch the guy singer, write better songs and lay down cleaner tracks. \nn/"
5,This is Bad Ass,how can people say that this group is an evanescence wannabe when lacuna coil has been around longer anyways this album kicks ass i love it evrey song has that creepy sound and the volcals are angelic the the guitar riffs are awsome this is death metal i dont care what any body says the good songs are well all of them
3,Good but not amazing!,"This album features some of the most polished sounds of Lacuna Coil. Though it isn't perfect. The two best songs, are ""Swamped"" and ""Heavens a Lie"". The other songs are rather repetitive, and just get lost in themselves.It also shows how the band has matured over the years, this isn't a great and amazing album, like ""In Reverie"" was."
5,Great compilation. Great price. Super easy purchase.,It took only seconds to go from sampling to purchasing to listening and enjoying. Thank you Amazon cloud. Hope to use again soon.
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN ROCK","Comalies and Fallen (i.e. reviewers comparisons to Evanescence) are both A++ works that belong in everyones collection. They take modern rock to a whole new level, at a time when the popularity of rock has diminished. Everyone in the USA should tell their friends about Lacuna Coil, because Italian rock bands probably don't get much coverage."
5,Running Scared (1986),"This movie is a classic for me. Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal at their best! If you like 80's comedy, this one should be in your collection."
4,Good Book,"I thought this was a good book. I read it relatively quick and it held my interest. Sometimes it is hard reading a good book by Brenda Jackson because sometimes I find myself trying to compare them all to Fire and Desire or 1 of the Madaris brothers. It wasnt a SMOKING hot read, but I liked it. I must say I have been reading other authors and for me none compare to Brenda Jackson"
3,good buy at the price,"I have had this system for about 2 years. For 200$ it's a great bargain. I think I got it for 250$ when bought my first plasma tv. MSRP was 350$ I think. Anyway, It has plenty of sound for a smaller room. The sound field isn't that large, so you really notice that your listening to a speaker system, instead of being enveloped by the movie. The sub was much stronger then I expected from an out of the box system, and has subtle, accurate response.My major complaint is the lack of HDMI, and the speaker setup process. It was very hard for me to really get the speakers levels were I want them. You can adjust the front, rear, and center independently, but I just could never get them how I wanted them.All in all, a good system for someone who just wants to make their movie or gaming experience better. Definitely better then just using the TV speakers."
3,"It's dope, but......","M-Boogie thinks he's DJ Premiere. For thoze that arent familar with Primo, he was the DJ in Gang Starr. Gang Starr made dope ass records. This MBoogie kid has a good ear for talent but not for scratching and beatz. Since he is Matt Terio the label owner he should stick to signing dope ass talant and not pretendin to be a wack DJ. I like the mix tape style of this CD. I don't really care for MBoogie's mixing. He's not undaground. He's mainstream. Babu is dope, KRS is dope not Matt Boogie.Why do I diss Matt Boogie? Because he thinks he's the bomb on his productions and he is no Peanut Butter Wolf, DJ Revolution, DJ premiere or Xecutioners. Matt Boogie should stop pretendin' and stick to signin dope ass talent and not frontin' like he'z got talent."
3,Decently terrible...,"I had this CD player for about 3 months now, worked beautifully, played fine, nice and load. Evem those annoying ear buds were actually good, no bass but good. now after all that your probally wondering, ""well then why 3 stars"", and ill answer: it broke, in 3 months, dropped once, and it broke, the little spining thing-a-mabob that spins the disk was pushed into the cd player some how, rendering it unable to turn at the speed needed....it was a wonderfull cd player though till then!"
5,Back to the 60s,"""Happiness is a Warm Puppy"" is a great new special in the Peanuts tradition. And I do mean ""tradition"". It's not just that all of the punchlines are directly from the strips, the artwork itself is a return to how the characters looked in the 1960s. Snoopy's nose, especially, is the big give-away. In keeping with the nostalgic feel, Shermy, Violet and Patty get to make a come-back; while Marcie and Peppermint Patty are nowhere to be found. The only anachronism to this trip through time is a brief appearance by Woodstock ... but since he's never called by name in this video we can assume it's one of the proto-Woodstocks who showed up in the strip for a few years before he was given a name.My only quibble with the animation in this video is that sometimes the character's pupils are too big. Makes their faces look out of proportion. Other than that, it's so great so have a new Peanuts special to watch!"
2,Had promise and didn't deliver,"I had a lot of hope for this Peanuts special. I thought they had finally made a Peanuts show that resembled the specials of old days (Charlie Brown Christmas, Great Pumpkin). There is no hidden messages or agendas to this show like some of them have had. However, it is similar to the more recent shows. It is nothing more than a string of the comic strip series animated and then clumped together. The end result is rather boring chow. It just didn't hold our interest. The art work and music are good, but I just wish it would have had more of a story to it."
5,Charlie brown,"The movie came in quickly and was new I package just as described. Got it before Christmas, so was able to give it as a present right on time."
5,Fun!,"Definitely an entertaining book, though I was actually pretty amazed what that awful-flavored powder will do! My bathrooms have never been so sparkly clean.Great stocking stuffer sort of book. Fun for the relatives/friends that have everything."
5,Good reading!,Really liked the ideas in this book. I live on a boat part time and it is nice to have alternative cleaning options that work and I feel good about being dumped into the bilge.
5,"Um, I'm Thinking About what a Great Book This Is!","Scout is about a boy who finds a Doberman and his family searches for Scout's owners in vain. One day when the boy is talking to his friend his friend says "" Why don't you let him scout around up there."" That is how they found out Scout's name. It is a great book!"
1,Not useable in Europe,"It is a pitty that it is of no use ordering this video's since it is only ment for US and Canada video recorders. It would be nice if the video's could also be made available for Europe without the need of special equipment. Therefor I rate this video box with zero stars. However that is not possible in the rating system, so I gave it one star By the way: the same is valid for a number of other video's and DVD's. I would order more if this problem could be solved"
3,"Close, but......","Not a bad movie, but not, unfortunately, a very good one. The animated characters are OK, the villian in particular is very good, but the gross-out humour provided by the live action leads is unconvincing. I find it hard to believe that anyone like that that could get a job to be fired from in the first place. The ending is contrived and sentimental in the extreme.However, I bought it, and I have seen, and bought, worse; so my verdict would be:-Close, but no cigar this time."
2,Not neccessarily appropriate for kids,"I bought this item on the suggestion of a student, who thought it might be good to show in our jr. high science class. I'm glad I previewed it first! I'd caution other teachers and parents on the amount of innuendo in this film... also, as a viewer myself, it just wasn't very engaging -- more depressing than anything else."
2,Boring Not Enough Action Gross Stupid.,Osmosis Jones Stinks!!! I t was on Cartoon Network on Direct TV and worst it was at my school!!! I watch this stupid Movie Everywhere!!! Not Even Funny Its gross The story is dirty sick father ate an egg that was spit on by a monkey and the egg was pooped on and he ATE IT!!! Osmosis Jones a Terrible character This movie is short thankfully The reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because I loved the character RED DEATH He is cool!!! Red Cool Talker and He has a long claw that burns stuff. Anyway dont watch this movie. OVERATED
4,"Funny, plenty of adult humor, not quite young kid friendly","This is a great movie, full of puns, inuendo's and one liners that only being inside a human body could pull off. It is about a lonely white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (played by kid rock) who is on a body wide search of a suspect virus that no one believes he has seen. Drex (David Hyde Pierce) is the fast talking, proper cold aid who, after seeing the commitment Jones has, joins him in the search for Thrax (Lawrence Fishburn). Bill Murry plays the host body, along with Chris Elliot as his best friend.This movie has plenty of twists and turns, and the thrills of a live action police movie. It is relatively medically acruate too. The reason that it is PG-13 is due to some of the semi-violence, near to bad language, and the inuendos. Overall, a very funny movie, and if you watch this with a 9-10 year old and explain all of the puns, should be enjoyable for them too, but not really for anyone younger than that."
1,"Preview, not movie",Not sure why Amazon has decided to list 10 minute previews as movies. It's misleading and frustrating. Can you please stop listing previews? Please?
4,It was a gift,"Item arrived on time, as promised. It was given as a Christmas gift and is being enjoyed."
1,Won't play on pc blu-ray,Tried to play this blu-ray on three PC's and would not play. Hung system. Worked on standalone player
3,Battle of the Smithsonian from Amazon,This movie was entertaining and a delightful movie but I am afraid I enjoyed the first movie a little bit more. I would rcommend watching the second movie only if enjoyed the first one. If you did not enjoy the first movie I would not advice watching the second.
3,Not as good as the first.,"My wife and I love the first Night at the Museum. I can watch it over and over again. This one, however, not so much. It started out good, but we both fell asleep mid way through. We never got to the end we stopped after we woke up."
3,Fun and entertaining.....and SAFE for the families,"You have to take this movie with a grain of salt to enjoy it. And when you dofinish the movie..check out the extra's. From there you will see how the moviedevelopped itself in what it became. The movie could have played many ways...morestraight...less comedy...more stress..If you have seen the first one, you should have no problems getting into thisversion. You have all the regulars and new ones also. Amelia Hart come close tounbalancing the movie with all her screen energy but fits in quite nicely as themovie humms along."
2,not the movie,"i was excited to get to watch this movie,but to my disapointment when it started I found out it was not the movie but a short subject on how they did some of the special effects.had I known this before I started to watch i might not have been so disapointed."
1,Not the movie,"Stop putting the previews of movies as free downloads. It's silly, I'm not going to waste my time downloading a movie preview. I thought it was the actual movie, for free."
1,Copy of what is already available on the web ...,"-in the first place, it is not ""in depth"" what you will find in this small booklet, but superficial;- in the 2nd place, this material is already presented on the web elsewhere (and free of charge ..)- in the 3rd place, there are a couple of errors in the calculations and formulas.- As well it looks like a ""cut & paste"" product out of the otherbooks from Bruce ...Bottom Line: it is not worth the money"
4,Great sound,"I discovered them about 5 years ago and was amazed. They have a totally distinct, gritty sound. ""Lost My Sight"", ""Going South"" and ""Dirty Hands"" are especially the standouts. Gnarly but hypnotic."
3,BE FOREWARNED : MISDEMEANOR,"The disk is very good, but were I younger would be furious that despite the presentation of the title it does NOT contain Beethoven's Fifth. One movement only of the Fifth. Go figure."
5,Fantastic shoes,Great shoes. Perfect fit and very comfortable. Fit to correct size but I have a very narrow foot so not sure they would suit a person with a wide foot.
5,Surprisingly perfect,"I bought this charger out of disbelief in the price of a new charger at the local cell phone shop ($30!). I know that the electronics inside ANY cellphone charger are DIRT cheap so you absolutely should not pay more than a few dollars for them unless you have no choice. Luckily for me the phone i was stuck with at the time i purchased this was old and there were plenty of generic chargers available. I received it in a few days and to my surprise it was actually nicer than the thirty dollar model! The plastic was of better quality and shaped more attractively, it also came with a charging light that the more expensive unit did not even have!"
3,4 1/2 stars IF you are a H.Miller fan,"3 stars is good for everybody though. About the first 70 to 90 pages tell you something new, the rest is HM's rhapsodizing. That in itself is valuable, but the main reason I value this book, is that here we have an artist speaking on another artist. That in itself makes it more insightful/interesting than the dreary biographies written by professors. Btw don't expect a biography here, the biographical details are scant. This is an attempt at the biography of the heart and mind. As for HM comparing himself to Rimbaud, he does so with the qualifier 'I do not have his talent' to paraphrase."
2,Archaic Typeface and Poor Readability,"I am not commenting on this work's literary merit -- I am expressing my disappointment with the typeface used throughout the New Directions Press edition of this title. The typeface is very heavy and dark -- some might call it a ""bold"" typeface -- throughout. It's very tough to read an entire book all the way through -- especially with eyes over age 40 -- in such a heavy typeface. My eyes are slugging through the text and the typeface itself is an annoying preoccupation while reading.I do hope this important work merits a redesign by NDP introducing a more contemporary -- and readable -- typeface."
5,Nice.,I got these to use for my bar b que but I use it in my kitchen for removing things in the oven.
1,I liked 'em better when they were kids.,"Mary-Kate and Ashley are snots in this movie! I liked them better as kids, because they were cute and too young for ""making out with boys.""These dumb bimbos MK & A played were stupid snots who were obsessed with cute boys and kissing. (Where have I seen that before???) If the twins are planning on making a new movie soon, I really hope they don't have to have any dumb love scenes, because that's all marykate and Ashley ever do in their preteen movies!"
3,What country are they in...???,"Well, for all of you Mary-Kate and Ashley fans you'll definately love this film. But I thought that the accents were terrible and the two boys they meet must be from the Yukon or Australia and never have been to Paris. I could do a beter French accent. Matt Winston made the show great. He's a great and funny actor.This movie is cool because you do get to see the monuments in Paris that you might not see. I recommend renting this movie before buying."
1,The WORST movie ever!,"Passport to Paris isn't a good movie at all! In this film, the Olsens were annoying, stuck-up, and rude brats. They were allowed to get away with disrespectful behavior such as playing too-loud music, sneaking out, and even saying that some of the food they were given was gross and they even tried to spit it out on the table! I was very appalled at what I saw and I will never watch this worst excuse of a movie again. This is NOT how I want my children brought up in the future. Now I think I'll get my TV and VCR out of my room because everything I watch is just a piece of crap."
3,Boooo!,"This movie has a little too much talking in it! I had a little kid over and she asked to turn the t.v off in less then ten minutes! I olso think that the ""kiss"" is very gross I mean they are only 12 in the movie!"
5,Love this movie!,I remember watching this movie as a little girl and I still love it! Mary Kate and Ashley were always my favorite.
5,It is out of this country!,"This movie was awesome. It was romantic, funny, and those boys were soo cute. I recomend it to all ages."
3,best when blended with hair spray,"This product has very little scent, which is my intention in purchasing it. It's a bit clayey and needs to be blended with an alcohol based hairspray rubbed in the palm in order to work best."
5,SHINIER AND SHAPLIER !,"My super fine hair often suffers from the ""limps,"" especially in warm weather. Bumble and Bumble Styling Wax gives it added texture and definition just where it's needed. My preference is for half bangs, which turn out to be full and fly-away without some help.The fragrance free Wax comes in a neat brushed aluminum tin; 1.5 oz. lasts and lasts. Perhaps best of all is the fact that it's not sticky nor does it give hair the appearance of a ""helmet"" as some sprays do. Plus, it gives hair an added sheen.For short hair it can be worked throughout for a style that lasts all day and through the evening.What would I do without Bumble and Bumble?"
3,"Nice but says a bit to ""creamy"" at body temperature","I don't want to say that it's ""greasy"" but it stays ""liquid"" at body temperature. I still use it now and then but American Crew Fiber or Davines Pliable Stucco are MUCH better for short men's hair.L'oreal hair putty for $10 is actually a bit better to me. I don't like that I could still ALWAYS feel the tackiness of Bumble and Bumble after an hour or two."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The very unoriginal album title should be the first warning sign. I really wanted to like this album a lot. Ms. Acuna has a very clear and sweet voice, but something about the arrangements just left me a little cold. They seem oddly dissonant, overly busy at times, and not easy to listen to. There's some production problems as well, and her voice occasionally seems to be too low in the mix. Some of the songs just don't seem to be well chosen, and are, frankly, not very interesting. It's not a bad album, but I was hoping for more."
5,WOW!,"I am not going to go into deep detail on the book or why you should get it or examine the details of the characters and what happens. Let me just tell you, if you have any interest on humans getting to Mars and living there you MUST read this book. Not only is the Science on the spot, but also the reality of it all. This is one of the best Sci Fi Books I've read in a long while. It's just a book you can't put down."
2,Depeche Mode Lite,"The later half of the 80's saw more than a few bands trying to capture some of that Depeche Mode magic, most notably Camouflage and Red Flag. Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but it also leads to questions of originality. If you're a big Depeche Mode/synth-pop fan, and you can stand to be insulted by this sort of flattery, pick it up."
5,Outstanding piece of work,"All the lyrics, and music in itself, is constructively emotional, deepening in love. I have owned this since 1990, and still in love with all of the songs. A must for those who reach for love."
4,very sleek..,Better than it's picture and also very small. It fits in the palm of my hand. Great reception
1,"It's Not the Service, It's the Phone","I owned this phone for a whopping 10 days before I got fed up and traded it in for the i860. It's a cute phone -- I loved the bronze color and the lightweight feel -- but for God's sake, if I wanted to take a week to get a text message through, I'd write a letter.I really don't know whose bright idea it was to add the unnecessary step of signing on to the 'net to send a message, but it made the whole process about 82 steps longer than it needed to be. Add to that the phone's infamous habit of dropping calls, sticky dialing and flat-out refusal to make a call sometimes and you have a real loser.Too bad. Cute phone, poor execution on Nextel's part."
1,"Stay away from this phone, and for that matter NEXTEL!!!!!","This phone as well as other nextel phones are the worst I have had in a long time; and I have had quite a few phones ... Besides the fact that they are the most ""technologically challenged"" phones (no sms ! for f*** sake !!!!), they have many stability and battery problems; and yeah .. they look absolutely hideous"
1,Horrible,"God, I was sooooo waiting for this album when it cameout...then I listened to it. Jeez Lew-eeez, what a pile of .... Do yourself a favor and remember them how they were before they put out this pathetic record. BTW...the only reason that I gave these album a star was because I had to."
5,Maximum Impact Branding,"Once again Alan Weiss topples typical thinking and challenges readers with critical thinking. The most powerful concept in the book is the power of branding leverage. A majority of consultants busy themselves with input methods that allow them to feel productive, but the output of their practice does not match. Alan shows how to rake in business through branding, plus how to keep it flowing with minimal effort and maximum return. For those who may feel overwhelmed by all the options, he includes a quick start guide that shortcuts the ""Where do I start?"" trap. Following these principles will put value in the lives of your clients, secure your reputation in a field without regulation, and provide multiple streams for turning your expertise into wealth."
3,"Henry Lee, MD book review","This book is a lot about who should take the blame for what. Dr. lee is fond of making hindsight remarks and seems to think if he wasn't on the case--Pffft--well it was going to be screwed up!I have great respect for his work, while he was right about some of the errors others made, it was not in his place to dwell on it. It made the other police departments working the cases look incompetent. This is a growing science. Allowances should have been made more often by him, for ignorance and/or lack of testing in small towns in a budding science."
4,charming,"Alfred Deller's voice is definitely unique... It takes some getting used to, but once you've adjusted he's very pleasant. Listen to the samples for an idea of what I mean. On this album at least he has a certain simple, unschooled feel-- understandable given his breaking new ground as an early countertenor. His power of expression is amazing; the singing ranges from vulnerable melancholia to joyous. Really it's refreshingly different after listening to a lot of technically excellent but cold singers (including more contemporary countertenor voices)."
4,Can't Beat the Price,"I bought these as a gift for my father, who was finishing a new room in a house with a whole-home audio system. The installation was a bit difficult - the screw heads are prone to stripping, but once I finally got them in, they sound really good. I would recommend these speakers for that type of application."
4,Good speakers,I bought these to use for rear surround. They sound really good considering the price. They exceeded my expectations. The install was really easy and fast. The instructions are simple and straight forward. I am going to install more throughout the whole house
3,"Good, but dated","The Red Sox Trivia Book was published in 1993, so it only covers history until 1992. It does provide a brief (50-page) history of the Red Sox, followed by crossword puzzles and trivia questions, and an all-time player list as of 1992. The questions themselves might be challenging for the average fan, but a real Red Sox trivia buff will not find them all that obscure. And they're directly based on the history chapter, so if you're going to buy the book to answer the trivia questions, try them before reading the history, or you'll likely be disappointed."
4,"shocking, then slow, then glorious","It really means something in the end, believe it or not. And its just enough raunch to make you uncomfortable and laugh all at once. It may seem a bit slow in the middle, but really its life changing and pretty cool, when you consider what he does. I love this movie. I have only seen it once, and my roommate loved it too."
3,Nothing New Here,"A readable precis not just of Ortona, but of the entire Moro River campaign (the title is a bit of a misnomer). Covers ground ably covered by Daniel Dancocks in D-DAY DODGERS and by Gerry Nicholson in the official history THE CANADIANS IN ITALY, but really offers no new insights into how the battle of Ortona itself was fought. A good book for anyone looking for a general description of the Canadians in the Moro, and some good interviews with vets, but again - the appendices are strewn with errors, there has been almost no research done regarding the German side of the story, and the actual fighting in Ortona isn't touched until page 251, and takes up less than 100 pages of this 400 page book. Anyone expecting a detailed study of the house-to-house struggle tht came to be known as ""Little Stalingrad"" will be sorely disappointed, as I was.Very little here that hasn't been covered in other volumes already."
4,A Meat Grinder,"American readers may not come across too many books on the Canadian role in WWII Europe. This book covers one of the most intensive engagements the Canadians had in Italy. Their efforts to take this ancient east coast town/city were one of the difficult campaigns to dislodge Germans from the easily defended, mountainous Italian strongholds. While such battles seldom achieved breakthroughs, this was one battle that significantly weakened the German hold. The detailed accounts of individual actions make this a good read."
2,bugflector,"Don't expect this bugflector working great, I just install in my van and drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco on I-5, I drive all the way at 80mph-90mph the windshield still get dirt. If i drive slow it get dirt was reasonsable but it's not."
3,Vintage paperback but great recipes!,"I found this vintage (1971) paperback at a library sale. It is very informative and easily read regarding Jewish holidays and cooking. I LOVE Jewish food (although I'm not Jewish), and I LOVE to cook and experiment with all sorts of ethnic cuisines. The recipes in this book don't call for ""exotic"" ingredients, yet include many simple, delightful and nourishing preparations. YUMMO! Enjoy!!"
2,A Wonderful Recipe Only Half-Baked,"I don't know if it's fair to review a book that one has not read completely, but I had to put down Nekropolis despite all the good things I have read about it... The author introduces us to an artificially constructed man, and can't seem to make up her mind whether he has no human emotions, some of them, or all of them. McHugh also confuses us with the idea of jessing, where one is biochemically and emotionally linked to another, then treats such a supposedly strong bond as if it were weak and easily breakable. Also, the romantic story here is forced for the sake of the plot. I put it down before too long, unwilling to suspend my disbelief. Sadly, this story needed another revision before publication."
3,"Interesting, but Depressing","Nekropolis is well written, contains complex characters, and deals with interesting issues. If you are looking for something thought provoking and do not mind getting a little depressed, you will find it here.However, I personally prefer books with likable characters, happy endings, and one point of view (or at most 2). This book needs a warning - ""I'm a downer!"""
3,A Good insight into how the Pakistani mindset thinks,"The book gives a flattering account of the Pakistani Air Force version of the war and doesnot attempt to see India's point of view. If Fricker had substantiated the claims with good evidence and proof, it would be good, other wise it has turned out tobe what it is, a work of fiction.Another point, the review below seems to be one of Frickers paki fan masqueratding as an indian!"
3,Could not put this book down!,I am very interested in the works of a medium. Allison DuBois is an amazing woman and author. I am looking forward to reading her other books. I chose this book mainly because I am one my mother's caregivers and knowing her cancer will one day take her from this world. I also know for sure she will always be with me thru her spirit.
4,A Bit of a Misnoemer - more semi-auto-biographical,"I like this book - just going by the title - I was expecting more of a depth of understanding of the dynamics of the afterlife. this book is more oranized by topics and doesn't always follow chronologically. There are some really inspirational parts - stories of others connecting with their loved ones via Allison. Still there are many insights in this book. I have had many lossses in my life - and one recently - I found much of what I was looking for in Sylvia Browne's book 'Life on the otherside'. I think Allison is a good person, she cares and helps - I plan to read more of her - as I rotate which 'afterlife' authors I read.On a percentile rating - I'd say in the high 70's - very good. Sincerely, Scott."
1,Do not waste your money and time...,"When I got this book I couldn't wait to start reading it. The title sounded very interesting. And I was very curious to learn more about a ""real"" medium. But as soon as I started to read it, excitement turned into boredom. The writing is so bad that it's almost impossible to keep the reader interested. I felt as if I was reading an essay of a 5th grader with too many repetitions and too simplistic words. The different chapters have no connection with each other and a lot of times it even seems as if the sentences in the chapters don't belong there. Whoever called this book a ""Page-Turner"" was clearly reading a differnt book than I did. I thought her story had a lot of potential but the writing just ruined it.Conclusion: Not every Medium is a born Writer.(I wonder why she couldn't forsee that?!)"
3,Don't Kiss Them Goodbye,Interesting book but I disagree with her assertion that psychics are born special. She makes it sound like people aren't all born with the potential for this ability. It sounded kind of ego-driven.
1,Absolute Disaster,"Not only is this book badly written, dull and monotonous. It does not provide any information whatsoever on the subject of so called afterlife, which one would expect from a book written by someone who describes herself as a psychic. Instead the reader is lectured on a hundred of other subjects i.e. what it means to be a true American, why one should love one's parents and why it is better to believe in God than not to believe (hello...guilt!).I only hope that Mrs. Dubois is a much better medium than she is a writer, because as the latter she absolutely s..ks!Patricia"
1,Not one of my favorites,"Allison DuBois' book was okay, it was much better than her television show ""Medium"", which I can not stand, because it is too scary and gruesome. Since I am one who is interested in the art of mediumship, I thought that the book would give me more insight into it unlike the television show. Well in my opinion the book wasn't all that great either. I wouldn't recommend it, but to each it's own."
1,"Get serious, please.","Okay....you want to be bored and part of a world who takes people like this seriously....be my guest. I have better things to do. The lady has a pro acting for her on TV-- she better get a pro to write for her, too."
1,Very Unbelievable book,"I agree with ""Ma Bell"". Nobody really knows what happens after death and if somebody tells you that they know the answer then they are scammers. I feel pity for small minded people who actually believe in this garbage. People who think that psychics and the afterlife are real are not very intelligent. But thats ok with me if they wanna spend their money on scams. Have fun making a scammer rich by buying their books then."
1,There are much better books on the subject out there,"I am not inspired to write a scathing review because I believe Ms. Dubois is sincere. I believe she does have ""the gift"". However, she does not have the gift of writing. I'm glad she can cross ""writing a book"" off her life's to do list. Now she should concentrate on her true talents."
3,Not all Serial Killer information,This movie shows a lot more of how the film crew tried to get in to talk with her rather than a lot of footage about her. Her adoptive mother seems to be more of a topic than Aileen.
5,"I waited and waited, now its here and well worth the wait!!!","I cant wait for the new SHXT!!!! Never has a cd made me so excited, i cant wait for the full length album The Amazing Jeckel Bros. This CD gives you a sample of 3 songs on the album and one full lenght song the Mad Professor, its GREAT. If you down with the clown you already have this cd, if you think your down with the clowns GET IT!!!!"
3,Fares Much Better Than Fabriclive's Premier Did,"Craig Richards gets the knod to kick off the Fabric series with this premier album. Not a bad effort, but I can't consider it great either. Fabric 01 is a set of minimalist house that is mellow and well-mixed, but lacks depth and soul. Despite the lack of lustre, you have to praise Richards for selecting a host of tracks that are not found on every other album from the same release year (which is a very unfortunate and overly too common occurrence with electronica compilations produced under different labels).3.5/5 stars."
4,Impressed,"Purchased this for a Ruger .22 I purchased for my girlfriend who is trying to get into shooting. Originally I wanted the Blackhawk but soon found it wasn't available for this gun. Once I got to use it, it really worked well. Took about 10 minutes to adjust the tension screw to get it just right for draws. Would probably take less time for others because I practiced many draws. It has no slop or movement when the gun is in the holster and feels very snug. Paddle inside pants is comfortable and has no chance of being removed unwanted. This being said it can be a pain getting it out of your pants without unbuckling you belt or what have you. 4 out of 5 only because I'm die hard Blackhawk guy. Holster does exactly what it says though!!!"
3,Hmmm....,Not what I expected. It's cool to have and with the price I paid I don't feel too bad. The handle is screwed in in a cross thread so it is cock-eyed. The blade is bent and the sheath is worthless. Looks better in the picture.
2,True Sounds Of Loverboy?,"Well, truth be told, this album's not as bad as it should've been, but if you're looking for the same band that belted out ""Abolish Government"" and ""World War 3"" during the peak of the LA punk scene, avoid this puppy at all costs. This is the late 80's incarnation of TSOL which featured Joe Wood standing in the vocal shoes of the great Jack Grisham. The title track is a charged anthemic rocker somewhat reminiscent of AC/DC or Alice Cooper, but for the most part this album's a pretty laughable slab of hair rock slop."
4,Works Fine but a Bit Clumsy,"This grill has two advantages, not ordinarily found on the same model. The heating elements are firmly attached to the grill surface, and the surfaces are immersible in water (along with the rest of the grill). That means efficient heating and easy washability in the same unit. It's somewhat of a Rube Goldberg contraption but, bottom line: it works very well. Worst problem I think is that since Emeril put his name on this T-Fal product the price has gone up."
2,Skip the Body Gel...,"I was pretty disappointed by this product. I love the fragrance (I already had the perfume), but this gel dries into the skin instantly , and doesn't moisturize at all, and the fragrance fades within about a half hour. I probably should have gone for the lotion or body cream. Live and learn :-/"
3,keeping starter cool,"not a bad product for the right application, didnt work for me, i installed remote solenoid instead. possible my solenoid was just bad and not a heat issue..."
1,nothing,"I don't remember watching this will have to go back and check this out. Sorry, i really don't think i got a chance to watch this or i am losing my memory, lol."
3,"Good story, too much analysis","The Metamorphasis is rightly considered one of the best pieces of literature of the 20th Century. The story is ambiguous, but satisfying, and surprisingly easy to read. I'm glad I have my own copy of this excellent story.That said, the essays attached to this edition are not to my taste. For one thing, they all seem to approach the text from a Freudian point of view. To my mind, Freud was a sex-obscessed hack who could do no more than project his own insecurities onto his patients. Of course, your milage may vary.I'd reccomend getting a collection of Kafka's short stories that includes The Metamorphosis rather than this book."
1,The Metamorphosis is Alright,"This novel, The Metamorphosis, in my eyes was boring and had no point in my view. I hate this novel and I rate it very low because it is very fictional and I do not think that changing that much would ever occur to mess up somebody's family that bad."
3,Nice and short...,"I enjoyed the book although I didn't read all the critiques that are included in the back of the book. I don't think that it's important to come to the same conclusion as any of the critics to like a book but you have to identify with at least some small part of the book. There are many circumstances that I really felt with Samsa, the main character, and his family.Very short and thus worth the small amount of time if only to get introduced to Kafka."
5,"A novel, that portrays the harshness of man-kind.","Who ever says this book isn't worth reading, must not know how to read and proabably has no taste at all. Who every thinks the latter must be trying to eat crack, instead of smoke it. The novel was was a great, is a great, and will continue to be a great. Read it and learn from it. The characters help readers realize how people can change. This novel is a window in to Kafka's thoughts."
2,The Metamorphosis is Only for Kafka Fanatics,"Though many have spoken well of this book, I found it rather slow moving and typical Kafka. Don't read this unless you are a huge fan and have read all his others"
3,It is what it is,"I guess it is a good book. It deals mainly with their relationship with old winston. (just like the title stated) But I was hoping for a lil more info on their early lifes.But it is still a good book, as a intro to WW2 British Generals."
5,Mangal Pandey,"Wow where has Bollywood been in my life! I was weaned on Hollywood and the movies coming out of there are mostly terrible. This is the second Bollywood movie I have seen and all I can say is excellent. My only complaint are the songs and dances in the films but that is a minor complaint and does not take away from the romance and sheer drama. I was so immersed in the story that I lost track of time and it seemed the movie ended too quickly. I wanted more!!! I am falling in love with foreign movies- strong story, character development, action, beautiful costumes and scenery. Hollywood better wake up or lose more die hard movie lovers like me."
3,So-So,"I enjoy a lot of the cranberry's early work, but this cd didn't excite me to much. It wasn't bad in any nameable way, but it just seemed kinda, I dunno, blah."
3,It's missing some essential element,"I love the Cranberries and I love Dolore's voice, but this recording is definitely missing something. It just sounds flat and uninspired, especially up against some of their other amazing CDs. The lyrics, unfortunately, are often sophomoric and just plain lame. Youch, I hate saying that but it's true. I even like To The Faithful Departed better than this. I'm kind of completist but this is one I can't even listen to so it's going right back into the resale bin."
1,Bury the hatchet?? not just yet...,"this is definately the worst cranberries album to date. i am a huge fan and the only positive thing this album brought was a tour that consisted of their older songs. this album is boring and lacks just about everything that made the band so good on their older stuff. lyrics and vocals .... but its good to see them together still, maybe the next one will do better but if your just getting into them, pick up everybody else and no need to agrgue first. you will enjoy this album if you like boring rock they play on radio every day like cardigans etc etc but if your getting it to hear dolores hit another one like yeats grave or not sorry... forget it! it aint here!"
2,Just not,"Big disappointment. Most of the tracks here sound like something that the band splited out of their heads while sitting around a bonfire on the beach. It seems that the decision to bury their hatchet also included burying their talent, or else I can't explain such songs as 'Just My Imagination', which sounds disturbingly familiar to Madness' 'Our House'. The only great song here, 'Promises', can't seem to save this album from drowning into boredom."
3,not their best stuff but catchy,"I guess I can understand why some fans are disappointed by this album. The lyrics aren't quite as strong as earlier releases, but I'm not exactly looking to have my breath taken away by every track on the CD anyway. I really enjoy the music though, especially ""Animal Instinct"" and ""Just My Imagination"" with their acoustic guitar work. The only song I really don't like that much is ""Delilah"" because, in the chorus, I keep thinking that I'm having a 'vinyl flashback' and the record is skipping. ""Copycat"" also tends to be a little annoying, but other than that, ""Bury the hatchet"" is pretty solid. Overall, if you want groundmoving lyrics and music that'll move you, stick to the first couple albums. But for kicking back and enjoying, or cruising down the road, it's great music."
4,This CD is great!!!!!!!!,"I respect others opinians about this CD, but let me tell you this is the one! I am a big Cranberries fan and i just love this CD. You never get tierd of this CD. Doloras sings really well in this one."
4,Just as good as their previous cds,This new cd by Cranberries is easy to listen to. I LOVE it!! Its just as good as their other cds. Nothing wrong here.
5,"this is their most universal, unified cd.",all of their albums are GREAT. But this one is just more than perfect. They sound even better. Its impressing. buy it!
2,"Average, monotonous new release","With the exception of 2 or 3 songs, this new release from the Cranberries, seems to be the same, boring song strung out across 60 minutes. Loyal fans only!"
2,Could have been better...,"Alright, I'll keep this one short. I really like The Craberries, but I was surprisingly disappointed to find that the only somewhat impressive songs are Animal Instinct and Copycat, a little bit. After their mass success with ""No Need to Argue"" most would consider,""To the Faithful Departed"" a disappointment, but Hollywood and Bosnia were really good, I Just Shot John Lennon, Salvation...the line up eventually was almost as pleasing as teh previous alblum, but I was sorely disappointed with the lightheartedness of ""Bury the Hatchet."" They even got rid of the couch! They need to stick some of their darker sounds in again like Hollywood, Zombie, and my personal favorite,""Yeat's Grave."""
4,Good Album!!,"Hey, guys! I just bought the album and it is very good! I love the tracks on the bonus CD, but in the new CD, O'Riodan did not put too much energy into her singing. I really hoped for her perculiar yet beautiful vocal and sing some songs like Zombie, in which she rises off the last note. I think she really sounded great in Zombie. But, this album is very GOOD!!!"
4,"I can't think of a good title, i'll say the c.d. was decent","It's pretty different from the berries old stuff, and the lyrics are pretty simple and may not make that much sence on some songs. But even though it may not be their best stuff, it is still the berries, so u have to pick it up it is definantly worth buying, and u also have to dig deloris' new cut."
3,it's average,they've become too commercial. gone are the lyrics that came from the gut. now the motivation of this band is to make $$$. the originality and creativity has shrivelled this once fruity band.
4,YES YES YES THIS ROCKS,"this book rules the first story is a bit annoying carzy game shows,escaped criminals,famous pets,substitute teachers and find out which 2 students replace the teachers and find out who marrys maggie in the future(its Gerald the one eyebrowed baby) oh yeah u should buy this book NOW!!!"
3,Om 1 & 2 are better,"this one is a strange one. still some good tracks, but a little too ambient...if you know what I mean. Just when you're getting into it there is a big jazz interlude. I like a little jazz but this is crazy. This one is more of a lable showcase than a continuous DJ mix which is what Om 1 & 2 were like."
4,helpful background,"in depth history of aa beginnings, including much insight into the formative reasons for the successes and failures of this program. very helpful for someone new to aa, trying to grasp the essence of the program."
5,Awesome but you must have a dedicated outlet!,Great at doing what it is supposed to do - shredding. One thing though....you must have a dedicated outlet for it.
2,"not introductory, not for dummies",This book is written with the standard 'for dummies' formatting but its contents are not very user-friendly. The explanations are too short and assume too much or keep refering you to other books or just state that it's out of the book's scope. The examples aren't very useful and are hard to follow because the author doesn't give descriptive names to variables and you have to keep guessing what's what.Summary:Extremely boring and sometimes hard to follow book. Doesn't help learning pl/sql much.
3,Does not work with my Dish HD service,"The product was certainly well made and heavy. However, it does not work with my Dish High Def Satellite service. When hooked up to the Dish per the instructions, the television signal will not come through the unit. When disconnected and plugged in the old way, the Dish signal comes through. I found this unsatisfactory because this is the newest version of this unit, the HTS1000 Mk II. I have read that older units will not work with Direct or Dish service; this was the newest unit and was supposed to have the bugs out of it. I spoke with two audio/video professionals about this problem and they agreed; the units do not permit the Dish Hi Def signal to pass through the unit. Case closed."
5,Delivers as Promised,"I just got a Panasonic Plasma ED TV and was concerned to get a good surge protector that might also enhance the picture quality. Before getting the Monster HTS 1000 I noticed some annoying picture glitches occasionally cropping up (I get a directv standard digital signal): a kind of vague line that, especially when background colors were pretty homogenous, you could follow moving up the screen; the kind of thing you could easily overlook but once you notice it, you can't help seeing it and it drives you crazy. Since running everything going into the tv through the Monster 1000, it's completely disappeared. So, this thing really does seem to deliver on what it promises: a cleaner picture."
4,"Monster Support says ""MKII"" version will support HD","This product is on the way to my house currently. I wanted to let people know that according to Monster support, they updated the 1000 to the 1000 MKII. The MKII version will support HD satellite and cable. I don't have it yet to personally testify but it is coming.4 stars because I had to put something there.Note the MKII is not in the title but is in the product details section."
1,Warranyt sucks,Warranty states lifetime. I tried to get a replacement after 5 years when it went out. Not a good outcome. I would try another product next time and would not recommend to my worst enemy.
5,"Works Great, Fixes a Tivo Reboot Problem For Me","Prior to using the MKII, my Tivo would randomly reboot now and then while watching, but has stopped since I put it on the MKII. I never noticed a picture or sound difference though.For me this is about the power fluxuations. The lights in my house dim and flash brighter frequently due to power fluxuations. I wanted to protect my equipment from this. For example, when my 36"" tube TV turns on, the lights dime for about 1 second.I am very happy with this power center. I feel more secure in the safety of my equipement due to fluxuations. I haven't had any problems with my equipment."
4,works fine - shows wires,"this protector i am sure works fine, but it is not the one you want if you have limited space for hiding wires.my recommendation would be to get a protector that the wires plug into the back. you can either stack the protector or put on a shelf, and have it blend with your your reciever and home theater."
3,NO VINCENT PRICE,"I was very excited about getting this DVD. Had I known it was concert footage I would have passed. I suppose if you are a real AC fan this would be a must have, But I was looking for the produced version of ""Welcome to my nightmare"" that starred Vicent Price. That is one I would recomend. You have to be a fan to appriciate this disc. I like AC, but this was a disappointment for me."
1,Dito on Really Bad,"A real disappointment on the sound quality. My old vinyl albums sound better. my rating, a minus star."
4,works great but......,I bought several of these watches for gifts and one for myself. They are very nice looking and work great but the band doesn't last at all...had to replace mine with in about two weeks of using it......
4,Terrific for lower body,"The only thing keeping me from giving this video 5 stars is the minimal amount of upper body work, as stated in other reviews. I would also agree Karen's cuing, especially as respects breathing, is a bit lacking in some segments, which is no big deal to me because I'm an experienced exerciser, but it might affect a novice somewhat. Overall, I find this to be an enjoyable but good workout for the abs, legs, and butt. (I've made it tougher by adding ankle weights for most of the leg work.) It is definitely killer for the inner thighs! Some of the moves appear deceptively easy, but if you really put forth your best effort, they should be challenging. I think the video is worth having, you just need to throw in another 5-10 minutes of upper body work."
2,Inner thigh workout,"I was convinced to buy this tape from the oatmeal/dead rats review. Total body? I found it to be little more than an inner thigh workout. The upper body work only consisted of some situps in the beginning and a dozen or so pushups at the end. The butt exercises are ridiculously easy. I should say that I am in good shape (casual triathlete), but we all need to lose a couple pounds and a lot of cellulite. This video just isn't going to do it. I don't understand the great reviews. I do this video when I feel like having a light exercise session.Let me throw in a plug for Denise Austin's ""Hit the Spot"" videos for arms, abs, and buns (three different tapes). These still challenge me after months and months of doing them."
3,great book,great book... too bad i ordered the wrong edition. But the shipper was great! THanks again
3,Good Book,"This book was pretty good. I liked it because relationships chang in this one. Melissa gets more used to her power which is interesting to learn about. There is anew and more terrible darkling that must be defeated in this book, and it captures your attention. You might want to read the first Midnighters first to get the whole idea."
5,An excellent detailed Qualitative and Quantitative Textbook for Operations management,This book covers every inch in operations management with case studies that brings to the reader life industrial experiences. It provides both qualitative and quantitative perspective of operations management. It can be easily understood and cover materials for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses.
2,Classic and Trash all into one,"In Flagpole Sitta, this record has released one of the best indie rock songs of 1997. However, with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 other songs, this album is pretty much trash. I guess i prefer local Aussie music. Mind you, I'm not referring to the teeny boppy tripe."
5,amazing!!!,i bought the CD for Flagpole Sitta and found myself liking the other songs so much. I hardly even listen to Flagpole Sitta anymore! You must but it!!
5,A true gem,"I bought this CD back when ""Flagpole Sitta"" was on the radio all the time, and I was disappointed when it wasn't what I expected at all. I kinda put it on the back oF my shelf and forgot about it. Terrible mistake. This past summer, I was talking about music with one of my good friends, and Harvey Danger came up. So I gave the CD another listen, and I was blown away. The lyrics are wonderfully powerful, and the arrangements are incredible. ""Problems and Bigger Ones"" is probably my favorite song on the album, although every track is great. Highly recommended."
4,Where have all the smart alec's gone?,"They formed a band named Harvey Danger.I'd give it 5 stars if they would not have started the cd with ""Carlotta Valdez,"" one of the dumbest songs to lead off with. Thank goodness Flagpole Sitta was waiting in the wings..."
3,Different and Mediocre,"Not bad, not great. Harvey Danger mixes Indie Rock with Punk to make a flavor all their own. The album is catchy and easy to listen to, but I could never really get into it for some reason. Most of the songs (especially 'Flagpole Sitta') get annoying fairly quickly, and I found many of the lyrics to be 'cheesey' ('Private Helicopter' in peticular). But then, there were some songs I really like ('Old Hat' and 'Radio Silence'). Overall, ""Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?"" is a unique and original album with a couple of great songs and several that I don't really care for. I think the band has a very high potential and could make a record much better than this once they mature. I listen to it once every few months, but this album has spent much of its time in my posession collecting dust on my cd rack."
5,One hit wonder? No way.,"Whoever calls Harvey Danger a one hit wonder should bite their tongue. Harvey Danger are NOT the Primitive Radio Gods or White Town of '98. ""Where Have..."" is a great album. Sure, ""Flagpole Sitta"" is a completely addictive, great song. But if you're planning to buy the single rather than this full-length, you should give it some serious consideration first. Sure, there are upbeat and humorous moments on ""Where Have..."" (i.e. ""Carlotta Valdez"", ""Private Helicopter"") but the band is also perfectly capable of writing pretty ballads (""Radio Silence"", ""Problems and Bigger Ones""). Consider them an amalgam of the Lemonheads and the Presidents of the U.S.A (both great bands). I'm really glad that I bought this CD. You will be too, if you give it a chance."
5,One of King's Best,"This book is written in a very cool and unique style that is enjoyable and makes the book more fun to read. The reader will be able to connect with the characters and have a good experience reading Christine. The story twists and keeps you hooked at every relationship and killing. This is a very good book, and whether you like Stephen King or not, this book will likely provide a good read for you."
3,Great Cast,"I get the sense that there were a lot of scenes that were left out of the final cut of this movie that might explain some character development. If you can suspend belief to get past some of the roughnesses, this will keep you interested.Armand Assante and Gabriel Byrne have an electrifying, riveting chemistry in the scenes they are in together and I found myself returning to the moral premise of the movie long after the actual run time was over."
2,Predictable,"As is all too common with movies this one offers slick hype, but with little substance. I found myself ""seeing"" the next scene and the movie's conclusion before each occurred. A real yawner."
1,Easy-reading was never more tedious!,"Shouldn't a good series include books that stand alone? Admittedly this is the first book I've read in the series, but I feel like I'm left hanging to figure out who these people are, and more importantly, WHY I should care. Not only do I find the characters flat and unmemorable, but the writing is downright juvenile, filled with not-so-witty cliches and forced one-liners. I didn't even know what Jake Hines looked like until the 57th page! Oh, and the plot development is painfully slow, as well."
5,La Nouba isa gooda!,"I've seen La Nouba twice and it is amazing, and the cd is nearly as good as the show. Its a rap, opera, circus tunes, meshed together with some heavy grooves all dancing around your ears without a net! It really is a very nice mix from the show. The only other Cirque cd I have is ""O"" and save your money, it is not good. ""O"" as a show is great and has some nice music in it, but for some reason they left the good stuff of the cd. La Nouba has all the good stuff and I recommend it highly."
2,Almost hate it.,"It's not horrible, but it's not good. I have Allegria also, this is the opposite of Allegria. I was expecting that type of emotion, composition, and power - instead I got RAP MUSIC!!! It's not bad enough to throw away, but this will just be background noise for me - not something I will be paying attention to."
1,This book was a hard to understand book,This book was hard to understand because some things did not make much sense. It had very wonderful illistrations.
1,Small Wonder?,"I bought two of these to back up vital information and photos. To my surprise, they let me down. Not only did I have to purchase a 5v power adapter, but I ended up have to purchase data recovery software after only two months of use.If it's important and you have to back it up, chisel it in stone before you buy one of these not-so-portable drives."
3,"not very good, DO NOT USE IN CAR","This product isn't very good on my sisters' cars which are honda and toyota. I thought that I would be able to use it for an MP3 player in car but it's just a bad transmitter for that purpose.It takes forever to find what station this is on, and the reception is just okay. Also it runs on batteries, I wish there was a power cord/charger aside from a USB cord that can attach to the car with this product."
2,Disappointing for the cost,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. From the picture, I thought there were two dolls and a bed included, but all it includes are the two dolls, which are not worth the price. My daughter likes them, but just as much as any other small doll. I wish I kept looking around for something better than this and saved my money."
2,Jorden lycra cami too expensive,"I tried to find out if this cami had a built in bra. It didn't explain what type of bra it had, but from my experience camis of this original price usually had a very good built in bra so I was very disappointed with my purchase and will never buy another Jorden product again"
4,A bit theoretical...,"A good introduction, but the authors tend to jump around in their use of subscripts and notations. You're best served by creating a little cheat sheet that you can refer to as you work through the text so you don't have to continually flip back and forth to figure out their subscripts. They also rely on readers being familiar with infinite series and other such information. Some of this may have been covered in the associated volume on Probability, but my Prob course used a different text for that part. The proofs are thorough and relatively easy to follow if you understand some of the tricks they use.Very little in the way of applied problems, however. Mostly mathematical derivations. On the upside, though, the answers are in the back of the book. So you at least know where you are supposed to get to."
1,Bad voice better downed out by synthesizers!,"Tina Arena's voice is very plain, one that's not any meter better than your typical trying-hard karaoke singer. The mix in this album was a bad idea -- by letting her non-appealing voice dominate the recording, whatever good is left of the song (lyrics, melody) is dragged to the low-quality depth where her voice lies.Skip this. There are many other artists out there that are worth listening to!"
1,Agree with dimentions,I too would like to know the dimensions of this article and if the compartments are all drawers or if there are shelves.
4,Good,it is a good tv series for the forensic matter. it so good it is going to make you want to watch this show even more.
3,body of proof...,its ok to pass time with but understand that several characters have been changed for season 3. The show does remind me somewhat of the Particia Cronwell character and storyline.
2,Very unhappy with the high temp performance,"Used as directed and lost 3 pens when the temperature hit 100 degrees. Foolish me, I kept thinking that the error was mine because of all the supposed reviews about how great this item is in hot weather. We had a small and a large pack. The small pack was essentially worthless, the larger pack seemed to be large enough to keep for for last for a few hours. Works great as long as the temp doesn't go much over the recommended maximum temperature for your insulin and/or you keep it cool by adding some kind of ice pack. If you're expecting the answer to having to carry around all the stuff in the heat...this isn't going to be it."
5,Damn the Defiant!,"This salty, sadly overlooked British entry fires on all cylinders. Lewis Gilbert (who'd go on to direct the original ""Alfie"" and three Bond entries) displays a sure hand here, with two first-class actors (Guinness and a deliciously hateful Bogarde) crossing verbal swords with gusto, while the always reliable Anthony Quayle organizes the men below. The denouement is worth waiting for, with stunning color footage recreating these beautiful ships in full battle mode. As period war movies go, you'll find this ""Defiant"" ship-shape indeed."
2,Why the hype?,"I read this book after reading an article about how the author was a new innovative voice in literature. Literature? This book is more strick erotica than anything. While Bernstein has moments of illumination and his candid honesty is appreciated, he also teachers us nothing new, his writing style more ADD than anything. Why do so many books like this get published--it's just one of those hustlers plays around, does drugs, acts irresponsible and never gets it together. Another thing that should deter people is the price of this book. Not worth it, AT ALL."
4,Terrific Research,"Thanks to Mr. Morgan's thorough research the REAL story of Wilbur Underhill has been told. I grew up in Shawnee hearing about the shoot-out just a half block from my great-grandmother's home and I used to pass the house where the shooting took place on my way home from school. For years the bullet holes were still evident until later owners covered them with siding. But the old timers had different stories about how Underhill came to be in Shawnee, who was with him, which way he escaped and even which furniture store he was found in. Mr. Morgan had the facts to back up his book and it was very interesting. I was bothered, however, with the lack of editing and struggled with the errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation. Would have been better if it had been ""cleaned up"" a bit."
4,An interesting view of the Best Broadway Musical,"Maybe this title is the latest and best modern view of ""West Side Story"". Amazing and surprise you'll have spending your time reading it."
1,DOUG IS THE WORST,THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE WORST VIDEOS I EVER SAW! THE ANAMATION WAS BAD THRE WAS NOT ONE GOOD THING ABOUT DOUG'S SECRET CRISTMAS! IT WAS DRAGED OUT AND THE BONUS EPISODE I MEAN SITTING THROUGH ONE WAS ENOUGH! PLEASE DON'T BYE THIS BAD VIDEO YOU'RE WASTING YOUR HARD-EARN MONEY!
1,Seems a little desperate!,"I enjoy a creative cook book but this is concept is a bit cheesy. Trapping a man with dinners, etc.--whatever. He either likes you or he doesn't. You can be the worlds worst cook and he'd fall in love with you regardless. Seems like yet another desperate attempt to ""beg for a man,"" now through food, lovely. ""I will cook for you, please pick me. I MUST have a man."" C'mon women, if you have to try that hard to fuss and impress someone then ""he's just not that into you."" Hmmm, where have I heard that before?"
4,Tasty way to plan a date!,"After meeting Mimi at a local book signing, we took the book home and found several delicious receipes that we thought would help our friend Marcy land Mr. Right. Marcy took the book home, cooked from the ""Cunnnig Concoctions"" section and we're happy to report the meal was delicious! (Although the guy turned out to not be worth a repeat meal.) The book makes a fun gift for any girl (or guy) looking for a twist on meeting Mr. Right."
2,Not Comfy,"This top was really uncomfortable. I had to tie it really tight for it to cover ""everything"". The knot in the front was annoying too. Comfort defintaley didn't even come close."
3,less than before,Apparently not all lots are made equal. I ordered this product for the second time but the first lot had more flavor and strength. I have tried only one other company of its kind so cannot give you a better comparison.
3,Short on expectations,"This movie is about a deeply disturbed bad guy who has no quams about shooting up a store for a few dollars. The beginning shows this bad guy as a Vietnam Vet - as if to suggest this is why he went astray. I find this guy very problematic because he wears a Nazi tatoo on his back and a Christian cross around his neck. Sure the swell brother tries to save him - but to no avail. So what is new...?? Very long drawn out scenes. No crescendo, and no point other that some people are really just bad and weird people. This movie is definetely not a thriller. It is definetely not even exciting. Three thumbs down.."
1,what tha?,"The sound on this DVD does not work properly. We had our surround system turned all the way up and the volume on the tv up to the max as well. We still could not hear all the dialogue. Not sure why this happened, but it did."
2,Dissapointment,"First, a warning:when I purchased this, I thought I was buying The Gamers DVD (by Dead Gentleman Productions), but got this instead. I was dissapointed, and this tempers my review.This Mockumentary shows a group of guys playing a fictional role playing game (resembling D&D;), that are about to break the record as the longest playing group ever.While the idea is nice, and some of the jokes are funny, I found this to very low brow humor (guy gets caught masturbating, the GM's costume accidentally looking like a KKK outfit), stereotypical characters and a boring plot.While it can generate some identification nods from RP-ers, and a few laughs (especially if you're drunk) this movie just isn't worth it."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought this conditioner because I had used the shampoo and liked the smell. Usually conditioners are life savers, they create a manageable soft head of hair rather than a tangled mess. This conditioner, however, did not deliver. After using it, my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it. Yes, it smells nice, but like another reviewer mentioned, I prefer a product that does what it says. My hair is not fine but I do use color and used this because it was supposed to be good for treated hair. No thanks. I got better results from John Frieda....at a much lower price. These BB products are way overpriced for the quality."
5,A Rare Find!,"Perfect! Been looking for this for ages, and found it at Amazon at a very good price. Item in perfect condition."
5,Holds a lot better than you'd think!,"I am a female and have hair that's usually between 2 and 4 inches long. This stuff works great by itself when my hair is short to give that messed up, spiky, bed-head look. As my hair grows a bit longer, it keeps its hold pretty well but sometimes I have to mix it with some styling gel.But the pluses to this stuff is that, when used by itself, it won't leave your hair feeling sticky, just a bit waxy. You only need to use a little bit! Use too much and it actually weighs your hair down and then it won't stand up well at all. So less is usually better.Just warm the wax with your hair drier for maybe 30 seconds, then get a little bit on your fingers and apply to your hair. The bottle may seem small but it really goes a long way. It usually takes me around 6 months to go through a whole container, maybe even longer.It's worth a try. Highly recommend. And definitely buy on Amazon. It's a lot cheaper than going to the salon."
4,nice workout - relaxing while still working abs and back,I found this workout to be relatively easy but still enjoyable and relaxing. I did feel as though I had worked out especially in my back which I could feel the next day. That's probably because I don't work my back very often. A few of the moves are also featured to those in The Method - Pilates Precision Toning. These are the only 2 pilate tapes that I own and find them to be somewhat similar.
1,Different color received than shown in the picture.,The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I'm not satisfied with. I will be returning these back.
1,greasy thick glasses,this was a complete buyers remorse purchase. I have never had such thick greasy filmy glasses. do NOT buy these
3,Not petite,"This was too big to hide behind furniture in our living room, and although its colors are beautiful, they did not match our decorum. But Amazon is great - took it back and gave a prompt refund. Love 'em."
5,Well worth the price.,"I have used the same strip for well over a year now, and This not only allows me to monitor my power usage, it allows me to monitor the electrical grid. I have it hooked up to about a 5000 dollar home theater system and it has been flawless. The sound quality improved and the amp no longer hums with no sound input. I have a newer tv so there is no telling if it would have ever had noise or not, but I can tell you my speakers are shielded well and after multiple power outages, no a surge has hurt anything. this is a wonderful product i recommend to anyone who wants to protect his/her investment."
5,"Funny, but very insightful","I love this book. It helped me to decide to become an Episcopalian. I always give a copy to anyone who is slightly interested in the church. It is very funny and light, but very insightful."
5,High quality,"I bought these pillow cases and sheet set about a year ago and have been very pleased! They are high quality, very soft and comfortable sheets and pillow cases. I'd highly recommend them!"
5,Adam,"The story is well-written, true to the original story lines, and has great character insight. I could not put it down until I reached the end. Looking forward to her next Bonanza story."
4,"Drama, but fun too","There are few dramas that are so much fun; few comedies that have such a taut plot. This film was just a great outing for Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland. Robert Duvall is miscast and underutilized as the victim of a conspiracy to falsely imprison an American in Mexico. Bronson is hired to get him out. Oddly enough, this unlikely scenario actually was a true story; odder still is the fact that Mexican law never considered this scenario and, thus, had no law prohibiting someone from rescuing someone from such a jail.If you are a Bronson fan, you will defintely want this disk; it is funny, sexy, and a taut thriller, rolled into one. If you are a Robert Duvall fan, you should seek other movies, as he was only a very minor player in the overall plot."
2,"Quirky, but boring!","Une Femme est Une Femme is more of an experiment than anything else, a prelude to Godard's better works, and I sort of regret renting it. Anna Karina is lovable as always, but she isn't given much to do with a pointless plot (""I want a baby! Who cares why?""). It's pretty forgettable, and a bit hard to finish.If you haven't seen any of Godard's works, I recommend starting with Pierrot Le Fou or Breathless. Skip this one!"
3,What a Woman Wants...,"""Une femme est une femme"" (1961) is the second Goddard's film - his dissection of a traditional Musical and Comedy. It may seem silly and nave at times but it is a funniest and most enjoyable of his films that I've seen so far. A pretty stripper Angela (Anna Karina) wants a child. She decided to become a respectable bourgeois mother and wife but her dear husband Emil (Jean - Claude Briali) is categorically against her decision. He loves his wife but he loves his freedom even more, and the child means the end of freedom. Angela turns for help to Emil's friend, Alfred (Jean - Paul Belmondo). He is ready to do anything for Angela because he's been deeply and desperately in love with her ...But a woman is a woman and blessed is he who truly knows what she really wants.3.5/5 or 7/10"
2,not good,"i ***adore*** Anna Karina, but, in my opinion Godard made only a couple of good films, and this is not one of them. i was fascinated by his films when they were new, but, for me, they haven't held up. i think there's just really nothing to them. i believe when he made a good film, it was by mistake (like so many other directors)... but i'll always be grateful for ""Masculin/Feminin"" and ""Alphaville""."
3,It was okay...,"I'm not complaining about the quality of the film. I love old movies and this was no exception. I'm upset about the content. I had understood that Baum himself had helped with this movie. I read all 14 of his nooks on Oz and expected this to be more accurate to the book than the 1939 version with Judt Garland. Instead, this seemed to be worse.I'm not sure if it was Baum or Hollywood, but this to not keep at all with the original book. I was very dissappointed. As far as being an early movie, it was good. It just wasn't what I expected. Unless you want an accurate version, don't let my review disuade you. It was still a good movie. It was definitely a comedy."
1,a curiousity piece to be sure,"This particular version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" was too heavy on the slapstick. I expect such things out of Mack Sennett, and I was waiting for the Keystone Kops to appear. It's hard to believe that only 14 years later, in 1939, a version would appear that would eclipse all others, past & previous. The ""music"" for this version was akin to nails on a blackboard, and I ended up turning the volume off to make this more viewable. What's wrong with a theater organ score?"
2,"RARE FOOTAGE, WERE TALKING 1925, COLLECTORS ONLY!","im not gonna say this is a great film you will be impressed with by 100%, but im gonna say it is an extremely rare silent film,a part of history that im amazed still exists, or is available at all,all hard core wizard of oz fans should have this to ""maximize"" their wizard of oz collection,comments have been made about the audio soundtrack,ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ""TURN YOUR VOLUME OFF"" TO EXPERIENCE THIS MOVIE AS A ""SILENT"" MOVIE LIKE IT WAS ORIGINALY INTENDED!,this dvd is offered at an almost ""giveaway"" price,*you watch,*this will go out of print soon and become a collectors item because of rareness alone,*serious film collectors only*"
5,Fake Parking Tickets.,These fake parking tickets look so real at first..my friend looked sosuprized and angry at first then got the joke later ha ha..
3,columbia sportwear ibex rain suit,We like the suit. It is light weight and time will tell its performance regarding durability.
1,This is why people hate fusion.,"Following their superb debut album, Quid Pro Quo, Brett and TJ have set out to make their music consistenly less and less accesible. And oh brother, have they succeeded--with Dennis Chambers no less!The best fusion is rock for adults with few suprises and lots of musical skill. But these songs--if that's what they are--are just excercises in unnecessary complexity--like Microsoft software.I notice an interesting parallel with Scott Henderson who is, of course, brilliant but he seems to feel the need to venture further and further into the incomprehensible. (Compare albums like Spears and Dr. Hee vs. the latest from Tribal Tech and you'll see what I mean).BTW, you can download some great Brett Garsed tracks at mp3.com and his instructional video also displays how great he sounds, playing over recongizable chord changes and tempos."
1,methinks trickery is afoot...,"Is it just me, or does it sound like the author wrote all these reviews? (Except for the one from Rockland, ME. That one sounds like a snotty friend -- another writer, perhaps.) Man, I hate that."
3,Historical fiction,Fiction built around specific historical events. The author brings characters to life in this gardening delight! A great introduction and lead up to the Reformation and turbulent happenings and lifestyles of the 17th century English court.
2,disappointing,I love most of what I have read by this author and so was surprised that I did not like this book. It was pretty good for the first three quarters of the story and then degenerated into a graphic homosexual love affair that not only made me uncomfortable but seemed completely unrealistic and false. Up until that time I had enjoyed the way the characters had been written and the way the story was developing and then it suddenly veered off and seemed as if I was reading an entirely different book half way through. It was less a book written about a historical period in time and more about the relationship between the main character and his employer (his Lord). Honestly it was a little weird and I was disappointed. What a shame her books are usually a really good read. If this was the first time I had read Phillipa Gregory I wouldn't have read any thing else she had written.
3,Not Up To Par With Philippa Gregory's Other Books,"I somewhat enjoyed this book because one of my favorite college professors depicted James, Charles and the Duke of Buckingham in the same manner. Gregory wove in some historial facts re. these characters. I did however find it a bit disturbing that she felt the need to go into graphic detail re. John's intimacy with the Duke. Truly, this could have been left out. I found it humorous that in the discussion questions at the back of the book, the question was raised IF John cheated on his wife...duh! Of course! Does the fact that John slept with another man instead of a woman equate to non cheating?This is not one of her best written historical novels. Like a stroll in an English garden, Gregory meandered and lost the plot in a maze of unnecessary additions. John isn't a character I liked.. He was indeed very much like the court company he kept, ie self absorbed, greedy and haughty."
2,an average picture,the piture could have been made comprehensively. sylvester stallone character seemed to be immaginative.the love scene between stone and sylvester is the essence of picture.especially stone has emerged in this movie as a sex symbol.
4,One of The Best Action Movies....,"I recently viewed this movie and thought anyone can make a shoot-em-up, kill everyone kind of film. However, this film contains a good cast, a good plot, and as typical action movies go, a lot of action. I've seen all of Stallone's movies and there are some better ones, but as far as pure action and plot goes this is a keeper."
4,An erotic thriller!,"Sometimes one regrets there are so many resources under the service of a narcissist project, destined to show two impacting anatomies employing an elemental and ultra known argument: the disturbed girl who seeks revenge in memory of her murdered parents. But besides, there is still more to mourn; two actors of the height caliber of James Woods and Rod Steiger can not fight against this predictable script.As light entertainment and some stylized erotic sequences, the picture works out, but please don' t scrape too much. There is nothing to find out. Maybe the soundtrack is the most recommendable of this entry."
1,I'll watch Stallone in anything!!!,"Except this!?!Wayyyy too much narcisim for one boy to take!!!Holey Moley!!! AND it had Sharon Stone AND the brilliant James Woods to boot!!!Plus Ms Stone... was showing her wares... although if it were a hot summer night in my house... I'd rather you didn't put your thong covered botty on my leather suite - Thank you very much.... Yech.... that's gonna leave a sweat mark!?!And the water the two of you wasted in that shower scene getting into just the right pose?Tut, tut!!! Think of the enviroment!!!HEY: Does body oil solidify and block the drains like chip fat does???Seriously!!!All joking aside now:I was very dissappointed in the 3 of you!!!Cos you all had farrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr more going for you than this!!!Stallone where was the humility of Rocky or even Demolition Man?Sharon what happened to the shy, repressed sexuality of Sliver???And James...What was it again that I liked you in Mr Woods??? Been a while..."
1,Took way to long,"I oprdered this product and 3 weeks later I received it. I can not believe it took so long to ship this item to a domestic address. The movie is good, but the customer service was very bad."
3,"Good, solid hair metal.","If 5 stars is a classic and 1 star is a Britny Spears record, this record scores about 3 or 3 1/2 stars.This band is often compared to Cinderella, both because of the vocals and the southern rock vibe. Also I believe former members of Cinderella were once with this band. I haven't heard anything else they've done, but this record rocks. I actually prefer this to Cinderella's debut.You have the hits -- Girlschool, Long Way to Love -- but the rest of the cd is solid (if unoriginal) as well. Everyone has their favorites. I actually think the two strongest tracks on the record are In America and Hold On. It's worth noting that the album version of Long Way to Love is different (longer) than what you hear on MTV/radio. For this reason, I highly recommend the ""remastered"" version that has this as a bonus track.Forget what came after. Britny Fox's debut is a worthy addition to anyone's hair metal or 80's rock collection."
4,I Love ME Better than That!,I almost cried when I first heard this song. I heard it at the right time and hearing it makes me strong.
4,Hydrangeas,Very informative. Answered a lot questions for me about pruning and transplanting. Enjoyed the information about the history of the different Hydrangea plants.
4,Tuneful dissonance,"This mostly dark album contains some great moments and engages the mind with its sonic experimentation that can perhaps be described as a type of psycho funk rock, more or less along the same lines as Captain Beefheart. Navvy is a burbling ditty, the title track has interesting arrangement with rhythmic and vocal variation whilst Thriller! with its muffled vocals presents quite an eerie soundscape. The tortured vocals of David Thomas have a strange charm, especially on songs like I Will Wait, Drinking Wine Spodyody and the impressive Ubu Dance Party with its rousing build-up. My favorite song on the album is the semi-instrumental Blow Daddy-o that has an ominous and hypnotic instrumental texture with background whispers. The music is art rock with visceral appeal and although Dub Housing is considered a masterpiece, my real rating is three and a half stars. I find their pop album Worlds In Collision far more enjoyable and memorable."
5,Era,Fun and well done.The family makes you wish you were a part of it all!Haven't finished it but looks like this is the end of an era.
5,Great Book!,"As the mother of 2 little girls, I am finding a huge need for baked goods for all kinds of functions. So far everything I've made has been awesome - and simple. If you have children, this a great book to add to the collection!"
3,Anonymous ... from North Bend,I would recomend this book for people who like poetry. But for me poetry just isn't my type of writing. This book was a little too long for me. What I mean is that it is sort of a rhyming tounge twister.
4,Chaco ZX2,"I had wanted to get a pair of these for awhile because I know people swear by these for light hiking in warmer climates. They are great for creeks and lakes. They blistered a bit on the inside of my right foot but it comes with breaking them in. They are a little confusing to finagle the straps but again, it just takes some getting used to. Definitely recommend these for anyone remotely outdoorsy."
3,Its nice to look at...,"We have mixed feelings about the tractor. It looks adorable and my 3 year old loved it the first week. His 1 1/2 year old brother loved sitting in the passenger seat while his big brother learned how to drive. I expect they will regain interest as they get older and learn to have better control of it. We are disappointed that it couldn't make it up the small incline to our neighbor's yard. It did pretty well on the driveway incline, but not dirt. We are also disappointed that the reverse broke within the first week. My husband took it apart, tried gluing the part into place, but the glue didn't set well. He managed to fix it, but for the price we paid for the tractor, I am disappointed anything broke within the first week. We are also disappointed in the truck bed. The hooks to keep it closed already seem worn after only a few weeks of play."
5,Great,I purchased this for my mother who loves this type of music. Just wish I would of known about the extended CD.
1,California Celt Lite,"At the 3/17/07 St. Patrick's Day Parade televised by NBC, this group sang very pleasantly, but Bobby Darin's classic ""Somewhere, Beyond the Sea"" is hardly Irish. They weren't satirizing the average parade-goer's ignorance either; they were just as clue-less. If you are not interested in authenticity, and are nostalgic for 50s doo-wop, this a cappella group is very agreeable elevator music."
5,Wonderful!,Wonderful CD! I saw these ladies in concert and when listning to the CD it's as if I were sitting in the front row! I would recomned this to any one who likes celtic music!
4,Great ladies,"A little more Anglicanized that I prefer, but pretty well, nonetheless...the ladies have beautiful voices, very clear and great pitch range."
5,These Brothers weren't Fronting like the Chumps out Now!,"this the real deal Eye-Opening Rap&Poetry that is sadly missing from today's Rap&Hip-Hop Vibe.somewhere Between Gil Scott Heron,GrandMaster Flash&The Furious Five,Public Enemy,Krs-One,Rakim&The Musical Vibe that Guru has been Laboring with for Years you get all that&more with the Last Poets.I discovered there Work Years ago&was Hooked on there straight in your face vibe.I wonder where did the edge in Rap go? these Clowns out now in Rap are all Programmed to say&do whatever it takes to Jack a Hit from 20 years back.Last Poets were about making you think&Hitting you with Music as well."
3,"Enjoyable enough, but too short","I have always thought that the most impressive aspect of Glenn Danzig was his earth-shaking voice, and while my opinion hasn't changed, Black Aria has given me plenty of respect for his ability as a composer, as well. The sounds are dramatic and will no doubt affect each listener in their own way. I could not imagine listening to this over and over again, but it is enjoyable, especially when you have the right setting (say a cold, moonless night, or during a thunderstorm). The one problem I have with Aria is that it seems to end as soon as it really gets going. The first time I heard it, I thought that my CD had skipped a large portion. The minimal length is surprising and not worth the price I paid. It is worth hearing, however, and any fan of gothic metal will most likely enjoy it."
5,A favorite,We found this book in a garage sale a few years ago and it remains one of the family's favorites...criteria of my children love to hear me read it and I love to read it aloud!
2,"How can people call this book ""Empowering?""","It's a cute book about a bunch of entitled animals moving into your house, demanding obscure things,and then refusing to leave... all culminating with the heroine of the story giving in, and letting them stay.I don't get it. I think it's a bad message. Unless you're a squatter...."
3,A trifle disappointing,"I am not a lover of books written in first-person, because they center too much in the main character, who is not always the most interesting, and limits the actions of other players in the story. This is such a case.From the beginning, Duncan proves to be much less interesting than his father, Murdo, and his adventures are not as thrilling. He is indeed helped by ""Fortuna"", for whatever he is seeking appears exactly where he is looking. Too fortuitous for my taste.I always look forward to sequels, but not always do you find a worthy one. Again, this is such a case.The Black Rood is much less interesting than its predecesor. Even the story inside the story is less appealing in this book than it was in the first one."
4,Not your average sound,"When I brought this in for rehearsal my band stopped playing- ""What the hell was that?"" They said.That pretty much sums it up. You have to hear this thing, before you buy it.If your looking at the Blue Box you should know the Sound Samples from Musican's Friend are accurate. The pedal has a very unique distortion fuzz, and although it has a Blend knob only three settings are usable.DOWNSIDE: 1. The pedal takes on a life of it's own after a while, throwing pitch ramdomly. 2. It dramaticly drops the level of your amp and/or other pedal, so prepare to compinsate.Both Kim Gordon and Thurson Moore from Sonic Youth use this pedal to create 'noise rock' and if your really interested in this beast then you want a different sound so just get it and have fun."
5,Great Product,"Get the bang for you're buck. This product is great don't mean do bash the other review but, if you chip the plastic or break it means you have either dropped it, or you have adjusted the blade on the clippers way, way to much. I have my own for personal use and one for customers Love it!"
5,Huanting sound. Profound expression of faith. Superb recordi,"De Profundis is a beautiful, minimalist, and moving piece of religious music. Pärt gives voice to such intense feelings of longing, hope, and faith. The Theatre of Voices under Hillier performs superbly. This recording is exceptionally well engineered too. The massed choral voices have body and heft. Bravo Harmonia Mundi!"
2,ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST!,"THE OLDER I GET, THE MORE I DREAD THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS BEING TURNED INTO A MOVIE. ""RAISE THE TITANIC"" WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE, OR ANYTHING WITH THE NAME ""TARZAN"" ON IT. OH, I KNOW, NO DIRECTOR CAN EVER MAKE, NO ACTOR CAN EVER PORTRAY, OUR LITERARY HEROES THE WAY WE IMAGINE THEM, BUT COME ON, NOW! THIS IS THE STORY OF A HUGE SUPER-TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY WHO COMPLETELY UNDERESTIMATES A PRIMITIVE, BACKWATER SOCIETY AND GETS THEIR BUTTS KICKED IN THE PROCESS. IMPOSSIBLE? ASK THE VIETNAMESE. THEY DID IT TO US IN ALMOST THE SAME WAY. ANYHOW, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GREAT MOVIE WITH A MODEST BUDGET AND NO MORE SPECIAL EFFECTS THAN IT HAS. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO MAKE A COMEDY OUT OF IT?PLEASE..PLEASE..PLEASE KEEP THESE BUTCHERS AWAY FROM ""A PRINCESS OF MARS"". LEAVE SOME THINGS SACRED!"
1,Failed Comedy,"This was supposed to be a comedy. I think. It`s really hard to tell. It just comes across as being stupid as a modern tv sitcom andthat`s pretty bad.The original book was nothing to really brag about, but it was far better than this mess. I`m surprised the auther of the orignalstory has not tracked down the people who made this movie and beaten them senseless with a stick. Or maybe he did beat them senselessjust before them filmed this movie.Save your money, watch something more entertaining, like the grass grow, or the cat sleeping."
4,U Don't need to go there to LIKE THIS!,"I agree with DJ MattyC...this is a good mix of eclectic House and remixes of other remixes. I don't understand the comments by the ""Anti-Poser"" who didn't like this album. Maybe they were refused a room there???I've never been to Hotel Costes and don't think I need to in order to appreciate this CD. I've never been to Ibiza either, but I do like some (but not all) CD's that have been released in celebration of that place. The mixes and transitions from song to song are smooth and eclectic at bestI for one would like to see this series continue, and making it a 20+ song mix wouldn't hurt either."
4,Great for adding heft to thin hair.,"I have thin-to-medium, wavy, highlighted hair. I've been using B&B Thickening Spray in combo with L'Oreal's EverStrong Volume Shampoo and Conditioner with great results. After towel drying my hair, I spray 10-15 spritzes of the Thickening Spray on my (below should length) hair and blow dry on medium heat with a 1.5 inch round bristle brush focusing on the roots for volume and the tips for some soft curl. I will admit that this can produce a bit of frizz which is probably due to the combination of volume-producing products. But I've been able to minimize this by applying a flexible hold hairspray like the one sold by Garnier Fructis. Granted, this will not work for everyone. But I think this is a great combination of drug store salon brands that makes my hair look full and shiny. I hope other will find success with this combo!"
1,Changed the formula,I used Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for years to provide volume for my thin hair and turned several people on to the product. Then they changed the formula to Bumble and Bumble Thickening HAIR Spray. The new product not only doesn't provide volume; it smell and feels icky and mats my hair down. Bummer.
3,Corolle Hairstyling and Makeup Head,4 year old disappointed with the lack of makeup or hairstyling pieces. She may develop more interest with time. I have not seen the doll.
1,Hokey!!!,I was very interested in viewing The Forsyte Saga but didn't realize it had been updated in a new production. I was stunned at how really awful the first production was and haven't been able to watch more than 2 episodes. I would love to return the DVD's I have and exchange them for the newer version which I hear is wonderful.
1,Bad product,"Last tape didnt work. Very desapointing. I didnt feel like going trough shiping it back, product not good ! !"
5,Forsyte Classic,"The 1967 BBC production of ""The Forsyte Saga"" on DVD is a classic. Even in black and white it stands alone in its genre. The production captures the heart and soul of John Galsworthy's story because of the excellent casting, direction, and skillful use of resources. You forget the production was made on a limited budget. We do not see actors merely speaking their lines while relying on their personalities and star power. We see real people and share their feelings, ideas, loves, and hates. It's all there: the tapestry of human life as experienced in Victorian England. Buy this set. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Barrymore saves a 30s B horror flick,"Length:: 4:24 MinsFascinating as it is, it's not really ""horror"" and doesn't compare to such films as ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936), or Tod Browning's own ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935), but anytime you can see Lionel Barrymore hamming it up as an old lady, it's a film worth seeing."
1,Puh-leese,"The only people scared by any death/black metal bands these days are five-year-old kids who don't know any better (and what are your parents doing, letting you listen to death/black metal anyway? go to your room and study!).I have friends who like this style of music. I just pat them on the head condescendingly, and they never say a word (they're not too smart, these guys).Anyways, blah blah...blast beats...blah blah...vile lyrics...blah blah...grizzly bear on acid with a microphone...you get the picture. It sucks as bad as anything can suck. Perhaps even more."
5,Gore and Crap galore,"This is an awesome CD. Impaled surpasses Exhumed by far, but I have one complaint. Why do they like crap so much? They talk about it in almost every song. Anyway, this CD is definitely a must for any death/black metal band. Its heavy, fast, brutal, and has great lyrics and vocals."
2,"Good, but very long winded","This is a good book for people who want to learn more about the great Italian luthier, but it definitely has its flaws. The book was written around the turn of the 20th century and its style is very stilted and convuluted. I often had the feeling the authors could have conveyed the information they give us in two pages in one paragraph. Also, their worship of anything related to Stradivari gets to be a bit much after awhile. Still, this is the book to turn to for information on this great violin maker."
3,"Good for small ensemble, but I prefer larger ensemble","The performance is expressive, seems to capture the faith reasonably well. I happen to prefer full chorus and orchestra to the single voice ensemble., considering my belief that a good bass section is the foundation (especially with German composers)."
3,"Good overview, but felt something missing","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave a great introduction to the Marine Corps boot camp. I now have a better appreciation for all that my brother-in-law endured. There were two parts where I felt a little frustrated: the third person perspective and dated material.When I read a story, I much more enjoy it from the first person perspective. Although Ricks gave an account of what 3086 went through, the description of what it feels like to have a DI in your face would be more poignant coming from first hand experience rather than an after the fact interview. Also, the brief description of the crucible at the end of the book and the discussion of the role of a military without war seems dated, especially since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have probably affected the view of many in the military.Overall, I enjoyed this book, but there may be a few other books which are more up to date."
5,True Dedication,"This book was a no nonsense look at the Marine Corp Basic Training. It showed the mental and physical hardships of each recruit who underwent platoon 8086. It is a great book for anyone who wants to join the corp it gives a realistic view of the inside of the Marine Corp. I would recommend this book to every man, woman and child of the USA."
5,TRUE PICTURE OF MARINE CORPS CULTURE,"Great picture of the Corps. In 1965 this is the culture i wanted to join. In 1998 I regret i cannot do it all over. Ricks does an excellent job showing the power, the good the bad and the danger of a military thatis becoming more and more seperated from the democracy it serves.....If we could just get the society to shape up!"
4,Very good & a must reader for everyone!,"This book is a very good account of what my marine friends told me what they went through. I could not put this book down for one second. The was only one thing I did not agree with. Being an Army soldier, I only wish Mr. Ricks knew what it is like going through Army basic training at Fort Knox, KY. I was in Alpha Company 1/46 from October '96 to December '96 and we had an all male boot camp with every drill sergeant in the company being male. We did not have it easy like those in Fort Jackson or Fort Leanordwood, the way Mr. Ricks describes. The 3 drill sergeants I had reminded me so much of the 3 in this book. In many ways this book reminded me of my own 8 week experience of basic training. I greatly respect those 3 drill sergeants who trained me to be a soldier. This book is a must read for every person who ever was in, is in, or who plans to join any branch of the military."
1,Pure garbage,"I'm on my 2nd model, soon to be 3rd. The phone is terrible. It freezes up, regardless of what I am doing(sending a text message, trying to view a pic, etc). I can just imagine what would happen if I used it as a mp3 player. Stay away from this phone.Just somethings for people to know: This phone does not have picture caller ID, you cannot give individual ring tones to people, nor can you put wallpaper on the outside screen. Wish I had known these things."
1,wasnt feeling it....,"This sounded more like a rock cd than rap music. Annoying rock alterative beats that has nothing to do with hiphop music. And the rhymes were off beat the whole album. This is a dark grimey punk rock cd, not hip hop music."
2,Rules of neighborhood poker according to hoyle,I bought this book looking for tips or rules of games for a home poker game. After all it does have the name Hoyle on it. Instead I got a book about the author and his buddies poker game. It does have some games in the second half of the book but you have to put up with stories about how his buddies bet and how they play and what type of players they are. This is not a Hoyles rule book of poker games

2,To Me a Scary Read,"Ryder Sherbrooke and Sophia Stanton-Greville meet on Jamaica. They soon become entangled in each other lives. Thus resulting in marriage to each other in book with the title of The Hellion Bride. I liked the beginning and the end of the book. The middle of the book drove me into anger and rage. Why this author thinks she has to constantly have the male rape the woman to get his way with her is beyond me. I believe a successfull marriage is built on trust and respect. Not on fear and domination. I don't care how much Sophia teased him in the beginning of the book, he had no right to do that to her on the first time they make love. If thats what its ""called"". I wanted to jump into the book and hurt him and yell at him for what he was doing to Sophia. What I believe should have happened is for him to let her grow accustomed to him and learn to get to know each other. That would have let her heal emotionally. I gave it two stars just for this reason alone."
4,The Hellion Bride,"I've read the reviews that others have put in on this book. Let's face it, it was a book containing martial rape, but hey! It happens. Atleast Coulter shows ways that it can be overcome and dealt with. She shows that the male can have remorse and work through the woman's fears. I thought it was an insightful book about the trials and errors of the mental anguish Sophie had dealt with. The story line was intriguing. I will agree that it wasn't one of Coulter's best, but it was a good read. If you are looking for a book that will pull on your heartstrings, and make you love and hate the same character, then pick up The Hellion Bride and give it a go."
5,Well done adaptation of an Excellent Austen novel,"This is a fine movie adaptation of a beautiful story about a gracious, intelligent woman falling in love again with a former fiance. This Jane Austen story is very sweet and moving and the heroine is particularly worthy. Amanda Root did a wonderful job playing this role. Ciaran Hinds did very nicely as the suitor, but his character doesn't shine quite as well as in the book. Overall, a pleasant and touching film.Some of the negative reviewers below compare this film with Emma and Sense and Sensibility and if you are looking for high-gloss, Hollywood Austen, then you might agree with their opinions. But this is not a high-budget movie, and as enjoyable as those movies are, this one gives another perspective into Jane Austen's world which is probably more faithful. To true fans of Austen, this film will hold its own."
5,This version far superior...,"In my opinion, there is no comparison between this 1995 film adaptation and the latest Persuasion just issued. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are far superor in breathing life into Austen's characters in this story. Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, in the latest remake, are flat with little tension or real interest between them. The story, too, has been streamlined and lacks the depth of this original. Don't bother with the latest...this is the one to order and enjoy!"
4,Loved It!,"I absolutely loved this version of Persuasion. I wouild have loved for it to be longer, but I will keep it as one of my favorites."
1,waste of money,boring from beginning to end. I tried not to fall asleep while watching it. Watched once never again would waste my time.
1,Extremely bad casting,"I was anticipating watching this movie ... and i was really disappointed by the fact that the casting was completely horrible. Anne was cast badly, Captain Wentworth was cast badly...in fact the whole cast just seemed out of place. There was no good music in the background, not a significant, good amount of development about Anne and Wentworth's feelings. Lady Russell was cast badly as well. This isn't just a biased opnion, i'm sure many people would agree if they saw this movie just how badly it was cast and that the actors just ruined the beautiful story."
1,Austin Romance,I'm unable to rate this movie because it came as a DVD showing only the last part of the movie. The seller could not get me the entire movie since it is a charitable place where products are donated. I will have to buy it from another from another seller.
2,Boring Movie,"This movie was a dissapointmet. As if the acting wasn't bad enough, the plot was too dull. I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but this is definately worth passing up."
5,movie Persuasion,I love this movie and I'm really glad Amazon had it. The price was great too since no one else had it or they wanted to charge over twenty dollars!Thanks Amazon.
2,did they read the book?,"it seems like the actors didn't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts! amanda root is terrible as anne elliot... overly timid and shy... captain wentworth isn't at all handsome or dashing... and when they finally get together at the end, it's so awkward, bland, and unclimactic you wished you'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book... some people might have liked it, but i definitely didn't. to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like, i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice. this movie could have been better"
2,Not Great,"Unfortunately, though the story itself has potential, this movie was not done so as to keeps ones attention; I lost interest long before the end had neared. I found the characters boring, and Amanda Root looked like a deer in headlights throughout- I found it rather irritating, especially as you have almost no idea why she is so distressed..."
4,More Jane Austen's Master Piece.,"Jane Austen doesn't need any introduction, and this film has beautiful details of her history ""Persuassion""."
2,Drama without a cause,Am a huge Jan Austen fan but find this films leads don't have the chemistry to really sustain what is a great story love story. The BBC do it so much better!
3,It was ok,"When I received the movie I couldn't hardly wait to watch it.I really enjoy watching movies that came from Jane Austen's books that she wrote.I have to say though this one wasn't as good as her other ones such as Pride and Prejudice, or Emma, and Sense and Sensibility. Now those are good!"
4,Persuaded to view....,"....And it was a fantastic rendition of the novel. As true and close as you can possibly get to Jane Austen's vision with the time restrictions of being a movie. I felt sorry for Ann in the beginning, angry with her in the middle, and cried tears of joy at the end. To unwillingly deny the love of her life and still deal with a family who under-appreciates her is proof of her character and strength. In so many ways you can connect to Anne Elliot and her sad life. I bought the film on DVD and it's always a favourite choice of mine on those rainy weekend mornings when I curl up on the couch in my pajamas with a hot cup of tea. It's an emotional rollercoaster as only Ms. Austen can create. If you loved the book, you will enjoy this movie immensly. I know I did."
5,Superb,"Nobody deserves this special treat, no one. It is simply too perfect, too wonderful, too beautiful. I feel that I have seen something I oughtn't to have seen, that I have intruded on something glorious and magnificent and therefore private. What a grandly conceived project, so sweet, so sour. One wants so much for it to continue and yet one yearns for the happy ending we know is coming. The acting is exquisite. The sets, the costumes! Artistic perfection is achievable, by God."
3,Persuasion (The Movie),"I'm wild about the Jane Austen novels and movies made from these novels. This one was fair, but I felt like a lot of the story was left out. It is difficult to consolidate a Jane Austen novel to screen however since she was so very detailed in her books. Actors were wonderful though. All in all an enjoyable movie. Mrs. R. Miller"
5,Great casting!,"After watching Jane Eyre, I acquired a distaste for Ciaran Hinds. His Mr. Rochester was perfection and I could not separate him from the character. That is until I watched this version of Persuasion - oh I am in love now!"
3,Good viewing,"I love all things Jane Austen so enjoyed this movie but the main characters were so sedate that it would be hard to get into I think if you had not already read the book and seen the 70's version of Persuasion which was much more developed and more alive. If you like period pieces and Jane Austen in particular it's worth owning but don't worry about getting too emotional or stirred up by this film, you won't."
2,a slight disappointment,"I have to say that though I am a huge Jane Austen fan, I did not think that this movie did a good job with Jane's trademark subtlety. Some of the most important scenes like the one where thee group is at the theater near the end of the story was grossly over dramatized. If you want adaptations that truely reflect Jane Austen's spirit then watch Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson and Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow."
1,My fault ordered wrong one,"I thought this was the one from the Jane Austin series shown recently on PBS, but it is not! Althought it is ok, I doubt I will watch it again, I'll most likely put in in our annual Spring Garage Sale!"
5,A Jump In The History Of Human Soul,"If you'll ever read this book you'll agree that the history of the mankind is really about it: changing the subject of the history, turninig a medieval, supersticious, paranormally gifted man into an author of technology and science. It might not have happend, unless in the year of 1484 as Professor Culianu states the history would prefered otherwize. The question of ""is this change for good or for bad?"" could be hardly answered since the subject of modern history is us. And what we gain by reding this book is a nostalgy of what we were."
3,Just OK,"The VCR that arrived was broken. I contacted the seller to do a return and they willingly sent me a replacement. The replacement worked, but neither VCR came with a remote control or RCA cables. This is misleading as the photo on Amazon shows both. So make sure you get the required RCA cable (or an S Video cable)!!When it's all said and done I have a functioning VCR, but can't say this was a great buying experience."
1,nice try,"the movie was o.k. at the most. could have been more detailed and not soo slow. it was a curious buy, one watch and thats it."
1,Worst photography book I've seen in 40 years.,"I purchased at least 100 photography books during the past 40 years. This book is in a class all by itself. While the cover of this book is very eye-catching and promising, the contents of the book are very amateurish: the photographs are terrible, and you won't learn much from this book. I can't believe this well known publisher published this book! I returned it to the store where I purchased it and got a refund."
2,Not for the youngest Spanish students,Nice if bit boring video for children from the age of 6. Showing impressions of children and families and accompanying songs. Every line is sang and undertitled in both Spanish and English. Spanish is not very well articulated and requires children to have certain knowledge of Spanish in order to understand and try to speak/sing themselves. It was not the video I wanted for my toddler but may very well be the one parents of older children are loooking for.
3,Good reference material,"If you're as fascinated as I am by the history and lineage of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, this book belongs on your reference shelf."
4,Paperback Binding Bad,"I have two paperback books from the publisher ""Vintage"". Both fell apart. We all want cheaper books, but cutting corners to the point where they fall apart by just opening them MIGHT BE GOING TOO FAR!"
4,"For inquisitive, active young minds. Feed the imagination.","Reads like scifi, but it is all fact. Amazing. Great for high school students. Inspirational and stimulates interest.The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory"
5,Deep and Thoughtful Look at Reality,This is a deep and thoughtful look at reality through the eyes of one of the new generation of leading physicists. I thank Professor Greene for taking valuable time away from his research to bring the latest advances to the masses. It takes a special talent to take a mathematical subject and de-mathematize it and Greene's talents here are without equal. With more books like this the world would be a different place.
1,Well written garbage,"Greene is one of the better pop-science writers, but many of the examples he uses are extremely poor and bound to leave the reader even more confused. Any writer who doesn't know how (or when) to capitalize Earth (= the proper name of our planet) and earth (= synonym for dirt or soil) should not be printed in the United States."
1,I Can't Believe It,"I am giving a low review not because of the writing, but for the fact there is nothing new here if you have read The Elegant Universe. I dont see why there was a need for this book since no new information about string theory, etc has come since his last book. What a rip!"
4,functional,"This is an ok dictionary. I wish Hans Wehr would do for Farsi what he did for Arabic. Pronunciation help is basically nonexistent. This does not help. The Spanish Royal Academy dictionary lists Spanish slang from all Spanish speaking countries, even Spanglish from the US. This book... doesn't. It's functional, but needs to be much more than it is. As with all exotic languages, buy the most expensive dictionary you can afford, and also a book of idioms, if you can."
3,Description,"""I do still love you and want you back again.""Jonas's gaze roamed possessively over Bridges upturned face. ""So don't think I've given up, because I haven't.""She gasped at his audacity. How dared he come back as if nothing had ever happened? She thought of her struggle to rebuild her world without him in the small Vermont town--the placid, comfortable life she'd finally achieved.He wanted her back, did he? Well, he could just think again. Jonas had walked out of her life ten years ago, and she wasn't going to let him walk back into it!"
3,Clancy Novel- but real,"Gerald Posner opens up a whole new aspect of geo-politics that, when I heard myself summarizing to those around me, sounded like a bad Clancy screenplay- except this is true.Extremely enlightening, scary and timely. A super read."
5,"Irrefutable evidence, thank you Mr.Posner","Once again, I see Bush fanatics (aka American hating right wingers) are trying to dissuade honest citizens into thinking this book is all propagandic lies. What they don't know is that the adminstration has been exposed, the connections have been made, and this book will ultimately be the stepping stone as to put this fine country of ours back on track"
3,THE ERRORS OF POSNER,"THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY FACTUAL AND SILLY ERRORS. "" THE OTTOMAN FAMILY..."" THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WAS NOT A FAMILY. IT WAS FOUNDED BY OSMAN- HENCE THE CORRUPTION OF THE NAME- CENTURIES AGO.ALSO, "" THE BLACKS ARABS FROM NIGERIA AND SUDAN..."" WELL, THEY ARE NOT ARABS IF THEY ARE BLACK. MUSLIMS, MAYBE?AND ON AND ON. IT MAKES YOU WONDER ABOUT HIS SOURCES."
2,not good,"Made with cheap construction, did not look like the picture at all...sent it back the same day..not worth the money."
4,I wish that it had been more about Baker herself.,"Jazz Cleopatra is a slim volume (269 pages of text, plus notes and bibliography) but clearly a well-researched and well-written one. Rose's extensive notes and bibliography give a small idea of how much thinking went into the writing of the book, and indeed it has the feel of something which has been carefully considered.It is worth emphasizing that the subtitle of the book is ""Josephine Baker in Her Time"". I stress the point because I think that the reader should expect that this is not so much a biography (although biography is an important element) as it is a contextual portrait. Rose spends a lot of time on Baker not just as a person, but as an icon and the book is often closer to cultural criticism than ""true"" biography.This is not a bad thing, necessarily. It is just that I was looking more for biography and probably more for personality and that is not what this book is about."
3,Okay for the money,This was purchased for the trunk of a BMW z3 due to its size and shape it fit perfect...it is pushed by a 300watt mono channel amplifier! It does well on Country and Rock music. ...if you listen to either of those it is perfect...not made for rap music at all. it sounds terrible... speaker rattled right out of the box new and it had to be taken apart and soldered back together( loose connections internally where the wires hook up) It is just okay but dont expect it to boost out tons of bass...for the money its a good buy for just adding a little bass to an existing system...if you want subwoofers to thump real bass this is not for you...
1,Not good for mini-bikes,"I bought this clutch for use on my doodlebug mini-bike with the 6.5hp swap. It works for a little while, but doesn't last long. It quickly becomes really jerky, and smokes. At full rpm it will fully engage, but it's a bumpy ride getting there. I highly recommend instead going with the Hillard clutch if your using it for mini-bikes, or go-karts."
4,The First Crossover Trilogy Is A Winner!,"P>This is the first collaboration Nancy Holder did with Jeff Morriette, and I was very impressed with the team effort. They managed to capture all characters quite well.There are a few adult themes in this story, which helped liven it up, and it was easy to follow along despite the constant switch from Sunnydale to L.A.The characters were all very true to form (especially Kate, a character Holder did a very poor job capturing in an Angel book I read a few weeks ago), and the way all the events are connected is quite astonishing.If you are a Xander, Anya, Giles, or Spike fan, you may be disappointed by the lack of these supporting characters, but everyone is included in the action and the end will leave your mouth watering for the next installment.Kudos to the authors! It's a great story!"
4,Internal soundtrack and more,"With piano-based songs ranging from instrumental craziness (hidden track) to a lilting instrumental waltz (Waltz for a Sad Girl); from the brilliant jazz-noir ""Diagonal S's at the Motel 6"" to the heartwrenching ballad ""Give Me My Money"" Lee Feldman delivers another strongly-felt, sophisticated and always a little subversive CD. If you like 70's films, dada-ist humor, and songs that provide a soundtrack for your own internal offbeat film, this is for you."
5,literacys beginnings,So far I would say this book should be in every teachers Library because it has very useful resources and charts that help in assessing childrems language development.
5,Great DVD,"Two great movies, one low price. Got one for my dad and one for my brother. Bother were very happy."
3,Movie is great,"I am very happy with the quality of the movie. However, the sound quality is terrible. I have to turn the volume way up to hear it."
4,Excellent Item,"This combo light, radio, phone charger is great. I love it, I compared other similar items such as the black and decker and this is a much better item.The Dyno does the job very well you don't have to crank it every 2 minutes and the light that the 3 LEDs provide is plenty for emergencies. I've decided to keep one in each of my cars and one at home...this is a great thing.The price is also great, because the B&D; combo is over $40.00 on most places.The only thing that I think is not that good is the radio reception, having a small amplifier and a directional antena you have to play with the direction you point the radio at to make it work ok, other than that this is a great buy.Aloha"
3,Nothing special,I bought this product and Etón American Red Cross CLIPRAY ARCCR100R_SNG USB Cell Phone Charger with Hand Crank LED Flashlight (Red) to have around the house. The Dorcy feels...cheap with all the plastic. I like the Eton one better. It has metal body.
1,Not enough,"Recently used this item on a golf outing. I was pretty disappointed. Mainly because there is just not enough of the gell filler in this product to adequately go around more than half my neck or head. I had also order the ""Cool Bandanas"" product and found it had what I would estimate as more than twice as much gel in it to very comfortable cover much more of my skin. I'm also quite outraged that this product is roughly 3 times the price of the aforementioned cooling band. I definitely catagorically DO NOT recommend this product!"
2,"Good Idea, bad script","The actors performed well, but the entire story was poorly, directed and put together. better luck next time may be the trick."
1,Beware - The tanks leak for no reason,The Hoover works well when it doesn't leak. It sucks the access water out and is easy to operate. Stains need to be pre-treated but then the carpet get clean. I only used the machine about 6 times before the clean water tank just started leaking. I always took good care of it and cleaned and rinsed all the parts before storing it so there is just no reason for it to do this other than poor quality.
1,Poor quality! Not recommended.,"I have never written an online review like this but we just received these bocce balls and are quite disappointed in their quality so I felt compelled to.The coloring on the balls is cloudy, uneven and has other blemishes. They were dusty and the etching into the resin is poorly done. The nylon carrying case (not a hard case as mentioned in other reviews) would be ok except that if you take out the cheap thick cardboard box, there's nothing to hold it upright. It's all made in China and poorly in my opinion.Not going to return them because it's not worth all the hassle. But wanted to provide this info to others."
3,assemble yourself,We did not realize this was an assemble yourself product. Our daughter wanted a village she could play with and not just look at but is not ready for all the assembly. We decided to return it and get ceramic pieces pre-made at CVS
4,Action Packed,This is the first book that I read by Christiane Heggan and I was very impressed. It was well written and there was never a dull moment. I found the plot to have many twists and turns which were not predictable. Enjoyable reading from the beginning to the end. I would love to read more from this author.
5,Great product,"The delivery time was quick and the book came in great condition, just like the ad said. Would definitely buy from this seller again. A++++"
2,TOO EXPENSIVE F0R SALT WATER,I really like Entsol Spray but the expense is beyond the acceptable limit for the product (30 bucks for basically salt water?)
3,Decent,"I bought this at a local BigLots for $2. I used it on my mattress, and it seems to have worked well, but the cleaner-smell has lingered a little longer than I would have liked. Shop around, you may be able to find it on sale. Theres certainly no way I'd pay the price they're asking here, or even half that price, but it would be worth $5."
3,"Some Good Stuff, Not Much","It's a decent book. None of the material in it is blatantly wrong. It's just not terribly informed or inspired. Also, it's much more about strength training than actual combat conditioning. Go check out Ross Enamait's web site & books for really useful information on these topics. Seriously, there's nothing horribly wrong with this book, but you can get so much more for your money."
3,not for me,"This product arrived as pictured and described. I bought it thinking it would put a little fun into my day, but it's just too much for me. I felt kind of silly taking it out of my purse around the professionals I work with. However, this is still a good product for anybody who doesn't mind looking a little.. er.. young at heart. Just think about whether it is something you would actually use, because I ended up not using it. =["
4,Love it!,"The Bad Girl's Power Planner was exactly what I was hoping it would be. Small enough to take with me wherever I go, very pink (an attention grabber amongst all my friends...I'm quite sure I've inspired many of them to go purchase it as well), and cute little girly sketches throughout to remind me of things like what Fridays are really for (not for plopping onto the couch with exhaustion and tossing in a movie that I can fall asleep to!) It has a weekly planner, a space for phone numbers and addresses, note paper and ""to-do lists"", everything a planner should have, but stylish as well!"
5,fluance speakers,great off name brand speakers for the price. was looking for used polks and ended up getting a new set of these instead!
1,Hagalo Usted Mismo... Vendalo Usted Solo...,"Fracaso total de un disco mal concebido, mal grabado, mal promocionado, y mal vendido. Si un disco anterior a este se vende por mas de veinte dolars y este por menos de uno, entonces el mercado ha dado su palabra: el disco no es bueno. No lo compre!"
1,Complete Waste of what is a Good Story,"+ Keira Knightley is inevitably attractive.+ Supporting actors, specifically ""Domino's"" partners, have a few brief shining moments.- Everything else...- Shots do not stay still for more then one to five seconds. I am not joking when I, in a guestimate, say that the longest shot in the film might be maybe eight or nine seconds, tops.- Way too over the top. Instead of banking on realism, they went for what could be deemed as immature: they blew high-rise towers up, cut off arms, and had random lap-dances in the midst of a group of Southern-Cal gang-bangers.- Just overall stupidity of it all. The movie reaches for emotional moments, and then executes them with the sort of banality that leaves your mouth as dry as Arizona in the summer. The action scenes are ill-contrived and, again, once executed, feel pasty, phony, and just, well, fake.Overall: One of the worst movies I've ever seen."
3,wtf was with the crazed priest in the desert?!,"Can someone answer that for me, please? One minute the celebrity hostages are fleeing for their lives, and a car crash later they're all one big happy family, sitting around a campfire with some wacked-out preacher who just appears out of nowhere (in the middle of the f'in desert, mind you - full robe and everything). It was obviously supposed to be deep and meaningful, but the camera just spun around the priest as he mumbled some superficial 'the path is uncertain, but light is ahead' mumbo-jumbo, and everybody seems utterly fascinated with this guy, even though he just appears out of the middle of the desert and starts preaching to them right from the get-go. Very weird film, and whoever edited this thing deserves an arse-kick. 3 stars for showing domino give a lapdance in her skivvies though, that woman is straight fire."
1,UG Rated,"I give this movie my U.G. rating for Unnecessarily Grizzly. What a waste of Keira Knightlely! No doubt trying to maintain her indy credentials. And the Afghanistan tie-in made no sense. And how is it that after killing all those people she was released? The filmography was distracting. I'm sure everyone worked very hard on this grim, grimey movie, but why?"
3,RARE movie,"what i think about this film... one single word is RARE... this film was SOOO weird!!! it was boring yet had good action... maybe was the day i watched it... but i think im being fair giving it 3 stars!!it could even get less, no more!!"
1,stU p iD,"first, the editing & overall style is really irritating. Its AlL Fl aS h & Qu i cK & ch opPeD U p & e XT ragrIt y.second, the story lies to you, for example in one scene four dudes got all shot up with automatic weapons. Later on it turns out they didn't get shot as we see them rising up from their graves with the bullets flowing out of their bodies into the guns. It turns out they got buried up to their heads in the dirt. I mean its just stupid storytelling, nothing clever about it."
4,Great but doesn't last long,"Our Golden Retriever loves this toy. But it doesn't last long. He tends to distroy all stuffed toys. The quack is a lot less annoying than a squeak. We keep buying replacement ducks for him, and it's his favorite of all."
5,Instantly a favorite,My pup doesn't usually go for things she's not familiar with. But she loved the duck from the beginning. It's a great shape for throwing. It's got a squeaker that's not too annoying and very hard to squeak - she's only done it a couple times. It sounds like plastic crumpling when you squeeze the body. It looks good too.
2,Lots of fun... while it lasts.,We gave the Mallard to a friend's dog as a gift. The Mallard was a hit and the two were inseperable until the duck fell apart after about three days.
3,my dogs love them but they aren't very durable.,"So my dogs think these are the best toys around. Only problem is, I am constantly stitching up the seams where the stitching came apart after sometimes only minutes of play time. It is always the seams that split open, so if they reinforced the seams I think these would be a 5 star toy. As is, they are more work than they're worth unfortunately."
2,Inexpensive is sometimes cheap,"I recently bought this lens to get better macro shots wusing my Olympus Evolt 500. It was inexpensive and worth the shot. Well, inexpensive = cheap! Even on a tripod the pictures are often a little blurred and ALWAYS grainy and dark. I bought the same lens but from Olympus and, though I cannot get as close, the pictures are flawless! And the Olympus is also a very powerful wide angle lens. The lesson here, for me, is to save my pennies for a lens build for my camera - especially my Olympus cameras."
3,This is the Perfect Window Decal for a Minivan Filled with Cubs Fans,"I bought this to put on my wife's new minivan last year, and it's been great. It has survived many washes, and lots of weather. It still looks as good as new. Application was very very easy, and I have never needed to re-apply.Update: Since buying this last year, it is totally faded. It stuck to the car window fine, but looks crappy now. This is on a vehicle that stays parked in the garage when at home, and is not exposed to weather 24/7. Still not a bad buy, but less impressive than other decals we've used."
5,Classic Literature with a 21st Century Twist,"Kristen Heitzmann is a master of her craft. Her style will prove to be a classic of our day. Her poetic words entice until you become part of this adventure of suspense, romance, tragedy and, thankfully, a bit of comic relief.The lives of Lance and Rese intertwine in unseen, multifaceted ways. Rese, hardened by her past, seeks peace in opening a bed and breakfast where the land gives life to wine. Lance pursues a mysterious family quest while serving as her chef/maid/gardener. He voices her thoughts before she feels them, but is he real? Is the God he shares real? Two needy people searching.Along the way, there is a long-lost diary, a skeleton, and a seductress... along with a dog who rides a motorcycle (not by himself, of course ;-), an elderly neighbor with watchful eyes and heart, and tempting Italian cuisine.It's an amazing journey. Go for it!"
4,"What Does the ""Secrets"" Reveal?","It was a good read but started with a slow development into the plot. I enjoyed this plus a recent read ofThe Sultan of Monte Cristo: First Sequel to the Count of Monte Cristo. I like these two recent titles for the intrigue, characters, and captivating story-line. The main characters, Lance and Rese are easy to fall in love with. You will have to read it!This story was the first I read by the author. It was well written and gracefully executed, especially base on the recently resentment by readers towards religion. This didn't have too much! I concluded that I would give this book 4.5 star but since I can't do that, I will settle with 4 stars.Good read."
2,"Waay too long, too many bible verses","I stopped at pg 130 thinking it must be towards the end, only to see I wasn't even 1/2 way. Book DRAGGED. And I am catholic but still felt like there was too much preaching just to put it in there. The characters had some good development but at points I also felt like, enough already. Like others I wanted to like this book but really struggled to finish. I'd sorta like to know what happens to nonna character in the next book but won't buy because I don't want six more chapters of gospel writing & repetitive descriptions of how main characters cope."
4,"I liked it, however...","I was a bit disappointed in this book. The plot was excellent, absolutely loved it! However, Lance's beliefs were inserted there as if the author wanted to make it a Christian book without knowing much about it. I could be wrong but that's how it seemed. He deceives Rese knowingly, yet talks about God having a control, trusting Him in your life. All the nonsense about kissing her to comfort and having her ears pierced in crisis, it simply doesn't mix well. If God is in control, then Lance should have had to come clean right away. Or at least not justify it somehow, go to church, looking like a decent person and then keep digging and hiding things. And the book was a bit too long. The author went back to the things that were already addressed and I couldn't wait to get things moving again.I absolutely loved Rese's character, her struggles, strength."
4,More than a good story,A great story that is just not romance and not just mystery but also a reminder of who should be directing our lives.
4,best i've read in a while,i couldn't put this down...the characters are great and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep you turning(or swiping) the page. my only negative comment is that some of the character building/describing is bit redundant.
2,Wish I'd read ALL the reviews first!,"I enjoyed the characters and the story line themes but about 40% into the book it started going overboard on the religious preaching. References here and there are fine, but I don't like it when a book is used to try and coerce the reader into following along with the religion of the characters just to reach the end of the story - UNLESS of course, the book is specifically described as such. I connected with the characters, and wanted to see them through to the end, but after awhile, I just had to give up and decided I didn't want to observe an old lady or a young male trying to convince a strong adult female that she needed to accept Jesus to feel whole in her life. NOT my cup of tea at all. I just got the feeling it was bait and switch - a new theme of books perhaps? I just hope that isn't true. I'll definitely read all the reviews now, and if one says it's ""not preachy at all - I'll assume it is preachy!"""
5,Enjoyed!,"I really enjoyed this book, so much so that I had to buy and read the sequels! Great characters and beautiful story line. Loved it!"
3,Good but top heavy,"With the dreamy pen of the neo-pagan, Horsley writes of the near perfection of the 4th century druid and the evil overpowering of the chiristian invasion of the Irish isle. Through the eyes of Gwynn, a woman smarter than her place in life (and a little unbelievable) we watch the christian invasion unfold.I read this book in the hope that I could give it to my Mother to explain and contrast the christian and pagan cultures and give her a little more knowledge about my chosen path, but this book is so very hard on the catholics, I think it would cause more harm than good.If Horsley isn't a previous christian, her sources were, and it shows in the book. The only ""good"" christians in the entire book are the pelagians that the roman catholics kill and run out of Ireland with the druids.If you are a chest-pounding, skyclad dancing pagan, you'll love this book. If you still respect all religions, you may not enjoy this book as much."
1,Ho-Hum Novel,"It would be a pleasure to read a monograph about the early Christian church in Ireland and its relationship to Celtic nature religion and practice. This is the book Kate Horsley should have written, but the novel she wrote is tedious. Although I expected ""Confessions of a Pagan Nun"" to be a fictional account of the this period in Ireland, the motivation of the characters is not dramatic, the ""story"" is boring and too wordy. I always try to give books ""the 50 page test"" but I couldn't read 50 pages of this book. Then I leafed through it searching for historical research, but gave up on that also. Then I gave the book away."
4,A young girl must adjust to her father's serious illness!,"When Jorie visits her father for the first time after his heart attack, she hardly recognizes him. He's no longer the capable, humorous, strong person she's accustomed to being with. As the days pass, her mother spends more and more time at the hospital and can't provide Jorie with the support she's used to. Even her sister goes away for a week to visit their grandmother. Jorie simply has to adjust to her father's illness by herself. Slowly, painfully, she learns how to come to grips with her mother's absence. But she never loses her sense of humor and spirited interest in everything going on around her. And she learns that even though her father is changed after his heart attack, he's still special-just in a different way. This is a poignant, often funny story about growth, self-discovery, and love."
5,one of my favorites,"I absolutely love this cd, not just for the music, but for the hilarious comments in between. I love how Johnny Cash has a little annecdote for each song; it makes it more like you were actually at the concert."
3,"Great CD, but...","My husband loves this CD, but I have a hard time listening to the foul language and gospel music!"
4,Good Video,"This video was well done and Mr. Pollio explains each routine well, and demonstrates the steps. I feel this video was well worth it."
4,Marty Pollio is a very entertaining guy.,"This video is fun to watch, even if you're not interested in learning to juggle. I wonder what he could do with a bigger budget."
1,shameful!,I have been researching this with my mother who has TN and we went to look for this very book only to find used copies for sale for four times that of the book for sale BY THE TNA itself! I consider this shameful and akin to profitting from people's misfortune and pain as when a Natural disaster happens. Don't pay these prices! Get it directly from the TNA at www.tna-support.org
4,Needy Reader,"This book is a must for all who read english and are victims of the dreaded ailment Trigeminal Neuralgia. The French with their descriptive ""Tic Dolereux"" name give it a more general commonality approach and hence a broader knowledge base and understanding by the general non-suffering public. In England, a country astute in all things medical, has only as recently as 2010 begun to very seriously focus its resourses on this dreaded infliction. A member of the House of Commons there, a sufferer of TG himself, recently requested Parliament further funding for research into the causes and possible cures.(see for yourself on YouTube). Let us hope that our two countries U.S. and Canada) follow suit and become more dilligent in research into this very common but most sadly ignored horror.I gave it a four star only because of the price I paid. The book was rated ""condition like new"", but was marked up with bright red highliter throughout the book."
5,arthritis relief,"I find I have less pain in my knees and hips when taking this product. Most importantly, did some research and this company's products contain exactly what the label says."
4,confusing,This play is a little confusing how it jumps back in forth between time periods. but if you can over look that barrier it is an abbsolutly wonderful play you feal very sympathetic for the poor little girl.
4,DVD,The DVD arrived as promised as well as on time and in new condition. I would like to say thank you very much.
3,main point of his life is missing,"After watching it was clear to me the movie was done by people who never lived or visited Russia or for this matter cared to give us a message about Russian attemp in communism. Not many remember the name, especially in US, so with movie like this message is more important than anything else. The main point in Trotsky life was his exile and, consequentially, assasination by same comrades he made revolution with, he never understood it was not an accident but logical event for revolutionaries all over the world and as recent examples China and Cuba are perfect. The minimum punishment for being not happy in communistic paradise is exile and if you open your mouth to say something you will never talk again. Brrr, and I complain about US every day having more than I need and at one point contemplated moving back to Russia. Some never learn."
5,The Best!,"This is their best cd. It has the best recording quaility and best vocals. The only thing it needs is more songs! Were is I'm Okay, You're Okay, Southbound, and The Opposite! It is really good. the mix their lighter with their heavier and remix them all. I love all the tracks and don't have a favorite. I don't even have to pick a song to listen to. Doesn't matter wich one I choose. This is the one to buy. Somebody request Chick Magnet at their local radio station, and My Life Story along with it."
3,Not for the backpacker,"I felt like this guide focused more on travelers with a larger budget than me. This is a good guide for someone who likes to see third world countries through the confort of a nice hotel. But, for backpackers and budget travelers, there is little useful information. On the other hand, if your idea of a fun vacation does not include staying in a cabinas with no hot water, this could be your guide, because each region of Costa Rica is covered and the maps are useful."
2,"Just a bar band, and not a very good one","This Cd is a real disappointment. For starters, with a name like Lucifer, you expect something more dark and atmospheric. This is just some early 70's bar band who manages maybe two good songs out of this entire disc. Most of the time, though, they're rather dull. To make matters worse, this sounds like it came from a vinyl copy in less than perfect condition. During I'm Gonna Make It (probably the best cut on the disc), there's the popping so familiar to those of us that grew up before the CD generation. I love music from this time period, and buy lots of it, but I have to say you should avoid this disc. There's just much better groups to spend your money on."
1,Why doesn't Amazon have zero stars?,"""Filthy Rich"" by Dorothy Samuels tells the story of Marcy Mallowitz who on national television gets the answer wrong on ""So you want to be Filthy Rich."" Then to top it off her boyfriend dumps her on national television. But suddenly Marcy finds herself in the national spotlight, so what does Marcy do, she allows herself to have her fifteen minutes of fame.The book was the worst! I am so glad that I didn't pay for it! The characters were uninteresting and selfish. I can't believe that other reviewers liked this book!"
4,Fabulous Fashion Photogtraphy,"This collection has some great fashion photography from well known and lesser known photographers. If you are interested in 70's/80's models, the book also contains some great captures of models including Gia Carangi, made famous by Angelina Jolie in the HBO movie ""Gia."" I also enjoy that the book is not all photography but also includes background and stories on the photographers."
3,Mauritian Creole is a French dialect!,"This is one of a series of texts on Pidgon Language; The content shown in style of a research paper. Variety of sample phrases help our vocabruary building, and detailed comments on grammar are worth reading. Besides, I think it's very unique and useful for learners to meet with recorded conversation samples by children in the book. The main purpose is a study on linguistic bio programming, however, children's frequent mistakes in the early stages drew my attention and lead to a careful study. :) ""The Acquisition of Mauritian Creole"" is a good grammar book. I still want a dictionary. If I already had a dictionary, I would wish for a book like ""The Acquisition of Mauritian Creole""."
5,Speedy and crisp,"My impetus for writing this review was the polar viewpoints of the Seventh's finale. It is exceptionally quick, which I think is totally necessary for such a dance-like symphony. And as an ""allegro vivace"" you want jubilant frenzy of motion, not epic grandeur... the second movement handles the epic effect well enough.Symphony No. 8 is similar in personality to the No. 1 and No. 2, which have been highly praised in this cycle. The Eighth is no exception. Both Seven and Eight are speedy, with very crisp playing. Abbado makes a point of using a smaller orchestra and fleeter tempos to get closer to the performance practices of B's day.It's some of the best Classical music ever composed, and Abbado and Berlin perform it wonderfully. If you've never heard these symphonies, this is the disc to get!"
3,Mr. Mayfield the Urban Genuis,"I was a young inpressionable kid back in the 60's. Curtis Mayfield and the Impression kept busting up my heart with the truth life for those days and times. I purchased this disc because I don't want to ruin my LP's. This is a decent introduction but,only an introduction. A lot of good music is missing even if you don't include the Impressions catalog of music.Superfly was so dope back in the day, Motown had to get Marvin Gaye to put out the Trouble Man Lp and Wattstax Had to call Issac hayes to get Shaft in the mix. Just wanted to drop a little KNOWLEDGE on some of those pretender reviewers out there. Mr. Mayfield was gifted writer and song collaborator. So pick this disc up. Find out how Black-explotation was getting slapped around back n the day. They were trying to hold a race down but, that race got stronger and stronger. Keep on Pushing Peace and hair grease I'm out."
5,Beautiful,Beautiful story mixed wig history and love.You know that you Noy a book when you are upset you finished it.
3,A heartwarming story of a man's pet and how they bond.,"I thought the book, ""A Seal Called Andre,"" was a great family story. It is a story that I would suggest my future children and grandchildren read. It showed me how man and animal can form such a strong bond. It showed me the meaning of love between two friends and how someone can love an animal like a human being. It also shows how strong two friends have to work together to keep such a special friendship, and the obstacles they sometimes have to overcome."
5,A Great Book for Absolute Beginners,"Please note -- This book is exactly what the title says -- a BEGINNING shepherd's manual. If, like me, you are a beginner, you'll appreciate the clear and consise language the author uses to explain sheep and various aspects of sheep production. After reading this book, you'll know what questions to ask if you're considering raising a small flock. A more advanced book on the subject is ""Raising Sheep the Modern Way,"" which delves into more details, and which I thoroughly recommend."
3,Great vampire story with an Indecipherable ending...,"I loved this story and the vampire, Lilith. The book moved along quickly and i enjoyed the concept of the mother of all vampires, meeting a modern world. I really felt this book was 4 stars, until the last two chapters. After re-reading and re-reading, I still do not understand what happened. Hence the 3 star rating."
5,Great Stuff,"I recently purchased Tick Release and had a chance to use it on my dogShelby.....well,it's great stuff,worked as advertised, the tick backeditself right out and all I had to do was lift it off with a pair oftweezers.....I would strongly recomended this product and am going to purchase another bottle...........B.H."
5,Just a great jazz record,"After so many years in the business, Ron Carter might be taken for granted. But it can't be overstated--this is an absolutely great musician who shines in every situation, whether in support in the rhythm section or out front. His solos on this record have a drive and momentum that not too many bassists are capable of. And he put together a great band here, all of whom are playing at their best. In particular Benny Golson shows what a master he is, bringing the spirit of Lester Young to a modern setting with grace, beauty and power.Whenever I hear a record like this, I just think...this is why I love this music so much."
5,Le Chemin,This is a wonderful CD. My friend in France sent me a mixed CD of all the popular bands last year-and this band was on there twice. While in France I tried to purchase this CD-but I ran out of money by the time I found it lol. Although their old stuff is good-I find Le Chemin a much better choice-especially for the more alternative type of music that is popular in the States today. I believe Le Chemin has more of a rock/alternative sound than their self-titled debut CD-with some songs reminding me of early N'Sync compositions.
4,"bergman's ""comedy""","not bergman's best (no audio commentary by peter cowie on this one, hint hint) -- but still manages to underscore our need to seek out inner peace and happiness through romantic relationships. in this case, the brief scandinavian summer impels all protagonists to seize the window of opportunity, as everything falls into place in the end. cowie brands this as a comedy, though i don't recall bergman himself (in the introduction) calling it as such. what's sure is the master intended this to be a lighthearted approach to delivering a simple message. it was in his next film, ""the seventh seal"", where he was given the green light to go for the coup de grace."
2,Disappointing,"With albums such as Grace and Shanti, I was really impressed with the direction that Snatam Kaur was going in. In the enjoyment of her music, and with the release of this new album, I decided that I must purchase Anand. However, after listening to this album, there is nothing really new. In fact, the melodies are repeated and repeated with no movement and direction, and the content is also very repetitive. At least with songs in Grace and Shanti, and also Prem, there is variety in her music. So for me, Anand is not really one of the best albums. With such a wonderful voice, I would expect Snatam to involve more creative writers to allow her to develop her true potential"
3,A little difficult to follow,"I'll admit I haven't sat down to fully read just yet, but at first glance, it seems rather confusing and complicated."
2,Scary toy,"Bought this for a 2 1/2 year old. Did not come with book or video. Scared my grand-daughter, at first. Really ugly- but I guess it should be- after all she was swallowing bugs and mammals."
3,Cute but nor functional!!,"This rug is very cute as part of the Gossamer Wings collection. However, the backing on the rug is not slip proof so the rug does not stay in place. It is the worst I have seen! I have wall-to-wall carpeting and this rug is on top of the carpet and still it is all over the place. I have even put a backing specifically made for this purpose between the rug and the carpet and still no good. I have many other throw rugs throughout the house with the wall-to-wall and none others is this annoying.I give it a 3 star because it is cute and the colors go very well with the collection."
4,Nice Christmas addition,We have it right now over our fireplace and it's beautiful. Amazon had a great discount and I used free shipping to get this just in time for Christmas parties.
3,Good Stock Pot.,"I brought this stock pot because of the sturdy 18/10 stainless steel construction. The glass lid is also a bonus which makes it easier to see what is being cooked. It cooks food evenly like a dream. It is wonderful for a large family. It does not fit into a dishwasher well, but it's not hard to clean.The main problem I have with this stock pot is that there are no rivets on the inside for the handles. I use this pot at least 2-3 times per week and the handles are beginning to get loose. I have not called the manufacturer to see what could be done as of yet. If the pot had handles that could withstand time I would say this is a great stock pot for the money. Take the time to invest in a pot will be more sturdy."
3,fine toy,"I was hoping this ""pack and play"" folded like the real thing, but it doesn't. It's a fine toy."
4,Program Planning,"I received this book in a very timely manner. As a matter of fact, I asked the seller if they could send it express mail because of the class I was taking. They were an excellent company, one I will use for the next four years of college. Rated 5 stars excellent."
2,Standard Textbook,"This book is pretty thorough in the content it covers. However, I always say that the true measure of a book, especially a textbook, is how well the information is formatted and presented so that the reader finishes with a better understanding than before they read the book. This book is such a dry read that it's difficult, at times, to retain information after so many pages of just plain information. The authors rarely try to connect with readers and rarely try to offer innovative ways to explain content in memorable ways."
3,Whoa,Make sure you have time to read this and pay attention (fully). It's heavy material and I don't quite remember how bad because I read it two years ago.
4,Battleship,"A cheap, simple bath toy. A staple in our kids' baths. I think they'd like it more if it were brightly colored. They aren't into authentic battleship grey. I asked my 4 yr old if he likes it and he said yes. Then I asked him if he wished it were red, blue or yellow. He said he would like it to be green."
2,Multio8618,Basically not worth it at any price. Not even good as a paper weight as it can barely hold itself upright.
2,Showed vast promise,"2 1/2 starsDespite this album's horrible vocals and carnie-on-acid vibe, there are actually many times throughout the disc that you hear an amazing young band with some real fire in their approach. This album does work better as a sheer party favor for your head then an actual musical exploration, be sure that you want to embrace your inner 15 year old partying teen mode complete with crappy garage band rehearsal vibe, and you will appreciate this alot more ."
1,Disney Doesn't Get It,"When will Disney ever learn that people could care less about Pan and Scan any more and that Widscreen editions are outselling 4:3 ratio by large margins. They could have at least provided both versions on one DVD. Top marks for this campy movie, zero stars for Disney."
5,George of the Jungle,"My son loves this movie. It took a while to find it, but it was well worth the effort."
4,great comedy for all ages,"Good-natured, family-oriented comedy about a clumsy ape man who lives in the jungle amongst the animals and never seems able to stop crashing into trees. During a safari, he encounters a beautiful damsel in distress (Mann) and immediately falls in love with her. Despite their differences in lifestyles, he leaves his beloved jungle and travels to the big city where he tries to win her affections and adapt to civilization. It more ways than one this inherently goofy, episodic film resembles an extended television series with zany characters and a predictable setup, but it's smart, funny, and the gags are right on target. Fraser, never more likable, is perfectly cast, aided by a sly narrator and an over-the-top Cleese who really scores as the voice of ape."
5,Rolling in the aisle hilarity,"A great movie! Stress reducer. I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe, and all the kids in the theater were looking at me as if I were deranged. I loved it!"
5,Absolutely hysterical!,"I never laughed so hard in my life! Wonderfully silly movie. I enjoyed the cartoon when I was younger and was really excited to see the movie. I didn't believe it could actually be done. If you're looking for just a fun movie, then you have to see George of the Jungle. Those of you without a sense of humour...don't bother."
5,L'Enfant Terrible Strikes Again,"When the naughty muse known as Ian Philips first hit the queer literati scene with his stunning collection of literotica entitled SEE DICK DECONSTRUCT, everyone knew a brilliantly wicked, hilarious and singular talent had been birthed on the page, gloriously penned for all to read. With his second collection, Satyriasis, the legend continues. His turns of phrase, his pacing, his prodigious vocabularly, and his dirty mind all come together for a fundamentally unique and wonderfully entertaining experience. I laughed, I cried, and ended up wanting more, MUCH more. I am eagerly awaiting his third opus...."
2,con artist caper,"Sub-par con artist flick, two con men attempt to pull off the impossible---selling a valuable stamp set to a wealthy financier. The twists and turns that occur are outrageous---and the ending is so weak, it makes the viewer feel conned. Then again, perhaps that is what the director intended. Not recommended."
4,Wlton Armetale Tree with Holly Trivet,It is a nice piece. It will be suitable for winter or holiday decorating. Holly is not too detailed
3,MF Horn RIP,"Overall maybe 3 stars. The Band gets 4 stars - MF ""always"" has the most wonderful sidemen. Hession gets 5 for effort. Sadly, I cannot rate the ""Great Mans"" performance. At age 77 in 2005 when this was recorded, he appears to be way out of sorts. I have heard he was having several health issues at this time. Never the less, MF fans - add it to the collection.Skip ahead almost 1 year to the newly released ""The One and Only"" recording (apparently not available on Amazon as of 6/2007) and be prepared for a wonderful resurrection. Granted, it is not the MF we knew in his prime. But for this superman of 78 years it is a farewell effort worth its weight in gold.Ironically, and very sadly, a month after recording ""The One and Only"" he was gone."
4,MF's one last blast...,"Not his best by far, but it was a pleasure to hear his last album feature standards - with a MF twist, naturally. A must-have for collectors and fans alike of this high note-hitting Canadian."
1,BEWARE,"I bought this on monday and returned it on tuesday. If the ground is not 100% level, don't waste your time. It looked fun and easy. It was neither. Other people say it was fine, but they also said they were level. My backyard was off by about 6 inches left to right and that was enough to only let the pool fill about 20 inches. When you first fill it if one inch of water is not even you will probably have a problem. Good luck getting it back in the box. Lesson learned."
1,Maybe the worst Italian film ever,"In the Middle Ages, people generally did not stroll about in brightly colored, shintzy clothes. Especially not when they went on a pilgrimage, ""to seek the holy blissful martyr"". Roads and streets were not paved. People stank. One cannot convey that in a film, but please pay more attention to set decoration? The standard you would like to attain in that respect was set by Terry Gilliam in ""Jabberwocky"": shabby poor people, dirty faces, muddy streets. Or ""The Name of the Rose"".Besides, you can only follow this movie if you have read the Canterbury Tales first. Otherwise, it's incomprehensible. By the way, almost all Italian movies I re-view of late seem incomprehensible. I used to like Italian cinema, but its products do not seem to age well. The dialogues usually seem hollow and pretentious. One notable exception: ""Kaos""."
1,A LOAD OF RUBBISH!!!!,"I really wasted my money on this one! I was totally disgusted with this movie, it demeaned women in the most part and looked much like cheesey low budget porn film. There was really only one scene in the whole movie that I would have called humourous. The scenes of execution and murder were the most realistic part of the movie that I would even consider crediting the actors. I recommend no one buy this film if they can't stand, sex, violence and women being treated like objects."
3,This is a mighty peculiar film...,"It's certainly not a faithful adaptation of Chaucer's work, if that's what you're looking for. It includes four segments that are fairly faithful tellings of tales (Merchant's, Miller's, Reeve's, Pardoner's), along with bits that take one or two elements from different tales but don't really go all the way, and quite a number of unspeakably bizarre bits that have absolutely nothing to do with the source work. Extraordinarily strange, with less-than-impressive acting/dubbing, but sort of entertaining anyway. And...do my eyes deceive me, or is one of the extras in the first scene that guy (Nicholas something) from Are You Being Served?"
3,Good but not Pasolini's finest!,"""The Canterbury Tales"" is second part of Pasolini's 'Trilogy Of Life' but certainly the most innocent, and perhaps dullest, of the three. Based on stories by Chaucer the film has been set in England, however the native tongue has been dubbed in Italian with English subtitles. The stories are fairly adult in nature but mostly harmless unlike Pasolini's shocker, ""Salo"".Final thoughts - watch but don't buy unless you're a fan of the director!."
4,Satisfied,This item does what its supposed to do. It holds my tie in place and looks really nice while doing it. :D
3,Doesn't Really meet the test of time,"With no offense intended to Mannheim Steamroller, I just wasn't very excited about this CD. Probably the best thing on here is the Nutcracker selection, but nothing stands out as being original or a fresh look at music. The best thing I think that can be said about it came from my father, who heard it at Christmas, and said ""At least it doesn't sound like all their other music."" So, if you are tired of hearing the standard radio playlist of Chip Davis, this might be refreshing. On the other hand, if none of the selections from CHRISTMAS EXTRAORDINAIRE are being played, then probably none are very good (or popular).In retrospect, I wish I had gotten FRESH AIRE, which I recognize as having some of my favorite Mannheim Steamroller songs. I'm not throwing this CD away, but it won't be on the top of my Christmas music pile either."
2,Certainly not Chip's best,"As Christmas music goes, this is definitely a diverse collection, but little of it inspires the listener the way that Mannheim Steamroller's earlier works do. With few exceptions, the tracks remind one of the background music played as televised golf tournaments go to commercial breaks. Two notables though are Hallelujah and Fum, Fum, Fum. Hallelujah is reminiscent of Deck The Halls on Steamroller's first Christmas album, while Fum, Fum, Fum has the eclectic blend of baroque and sysntesizer that made Fresh Aire 1-4 so delightful. For those new to Chip Davis' work, there are many far-better albums to choose from. For fans of Christmas music, the few gems here might make the purchase worthwhile, although the 1984 and 1988 Christmas albums offer much more."
2,Disappointing.,"This album is no breath of fresh aire (pardon the pun). Unlike their previous Christmas albums (especially the first two), there is little here to recommend this album unless you are a diehard MS fan. I own all the Fresh Aire albums, all of the Christmas albums, and several of their other works, yet I was unimpressed by this one. ""Fum, Fum, Fum"" is far and away the best track here, with the special blend that made their other Christmas albums so good. ""Fairies"" is also interesting (for those who like the electronic side of MS). Most of the rest of the album is forgettable, and a few pieces (""White Christmas"", ""O Tannenbaum"") are pretty bad."
2,If you have one--you have them all,"I wasn't going to buy this CD but I broke down in the spirit of the holiday and spent my money on it. It's nice but once you own 1 or 2 of the other cd's---well, they all sound the same. There is nothing exciting or different as far as I'm concerned."
4,christmas music,Just what I wanted Has the song that I was looking for and many more also that are very entertaining.
1,Music Man Where Are You?,"OK, I'm curious about Music_Man and why he singled my review out? Did he not see other negative reviews, some with pretty nasty headings? Did he not understand that this was MY opinion only? And why did my review anger him where others did not? And where is his review? Just questioning. I DO understand ""this kind"" of music and I do absolutely love Mannheim Steamroller, but unfortunately I do not love this album. Nor does anyone else that I have played it for. Thanks very much!"
3,better than a magazine rolled up,"this product is sturdy and useful, but does not actually kill flying bugs if they have landed. It is better than a rolled up magazine, but not as good as a traditional fly swatter"
1,Couldn't stand it anymore and turned it off after 20 minutes or so,"I totally agree with the other reviewer who rated this movie only 1 star. It is soooooooooooooo sloooooooooooooow. By the time we gave up on this movie from utter boredom, the main character of the horse hadn't even shown up yet. The music is indeed annoying, as is the inordinate number of camera shots of fences. Yes, fences. Over and over, the shots focus on fences. What is with that? Given that the action in this movie is about as exciting as watching a fence, maybe it's a subliminal statement."
3,"Beautiful horses, predictable plot","Honestly, the only reason I bought this movie is because most (all?) of the horses in it are American Saddlebreds, my favorite horse breed. They are gorgeous, particularly the horse playing Winston. (Really, though, couldn't they come up with a better name for him than Winston?) However, not being a Christian, I could have done without the God stuff. If you're into that, you'll probably like it better than I did. The cinematography is good and the acting is decent, but it's obvious from the beginning where this story is going. I mean, is there really any doubt that the ""bad girl"" is going to find Jesus and turn her life around? If you don't know the answer to that question, don't let me spoil the movie for you! I guess you'll just have to watch it and find out. Bottom line: If you're a horse nut and/or Christian you'll probably like it. If you're neither of those, you might want to skip it."
4,Excellent selection of vacation and starter home plans,Excellent selection of vacation and starter home plans. This book will provide many hours of planning & dreaming as well as the opportunity to make those dreams a reality.
2,may cure insomnia...,"Evolutionary Psychologist David Buss advances the nature over nurture argument that humans are pre-programmed in our genes to kill in the right circumstances and most murders can be explained as being rooted in our DNA.Pretty boring, filled with stats, and not really targeting the reader who is used to true crime books by Ann Rule, John Douglas, Robert Ressler, etc. Very dry and not particulary interesting to me.Title is also misleading, which is why you shouldn't judge (or buy) a book for its cover"
4,Read It,Very thought provoking. This book gives insight into the reasons behind human behaviors that I did not understand before. And to top it off it is also entertaining.
4,This Japanese edition artwork just like LP,I believe the previous review is referring to a different edition of Benefit. This Japanese LP Sleeve version is a small reproduction of the LP cover (no annoying white band saying remaster etc. which the previous reviewer referred to).
3,No Difference,"I didn't see any ""curl definition"" as it states. My hair wasn't any smoother, moisturized, or defined. It smells nice. It didn't dry my hair like a cheap hotel shampoo would. But it didn't do anything that it claimed it would."
3,An Imitation?,"I don't mean to rain on anybody's bandwagon of praise for this novel, but it strikes me as all too close an imitation of Harry Turtledove's ""Legion of Videssos"" series. I mean, instead of a lost Roman Legion being mysteriously transported to a fantasy world, we have an American Civil War regiment.Same song, second verse."
4,Exciting and fast-moving,"Not a fan of sharks in any way, but this was a good story. A little gory in places and didn't like it as much as ""Akel Dama"", but I will definitely be reading more of Simmons' books."
3,Enjoyable read,"OK, this isn't the best book I've ever read. But, I found it enjoyable and was not really disappointed. I would have been disappointed if there were no sequels! Character development is definitely a sore point. The magical system is poorly explained--it seems more like Alice in Wonderland than Tolkien (the paragon of all fantasy). But, the plot was gripping and the writing was good."
3,"Light, easy reading.","I liked this book well enough but I borrowed it from the library. From, the start, it threatened to be another long series and I didn't want to get hooked and wind up spending more than a 100 dollars for something that may be no good at all. The main problem I had with it is that it was too reminescent of Jordan's Wheel of time without being half as engrossing. Also, I didn't like having all of the supporting characters killed off or just dropping out of the story. And did anybody notice the similarity between the names Li-Ane and iL-nA?"
2,Horrible High Fantasy,"The structure of this novel makes me think of an encounter table from early D&D.; It is episodic, stringed together by the vague characters presented in the opening chapter.The ""encounters"" are mostly borrowed from classical fairy tales and presents nothing new. I get the feeling that he got several ideas but didn't really know how to fit them together in a book.I see no reason to continue read this author, he lacks in character presentation, story construction, plot imagination and has a suspect way of handling the English grammar (but as a non native English speaker I can't complain too much about that;-)Someone not to familiar with the fantasy genre may like this, but it is so many better fantasy writers out there that I can hardly belive that anyone used to reading fantasy would like this one ..."
3,A good read.,"This was an enjoyable read, with some creative ideas and plot twists that kept it fairly original. Not an earth-shaking novel by any means, though. It is often hard to see how the different subplots are related in the overall story (until the very end, that is). I did get a feeling that there were similarities developing with the Legacy of Gird series by Elizabeth Moon (unknown shepherd leads people to overthrow corrupt and evil rulers), but we'll see if that impression holds true in the sequels."
1,Words fail me...,"I don't have good taste in literature so it's pretty bad when I think a book totally stinks. Lord of the Isles is like a leftover Mcdonald's fries, stale, dull and simply dull to the taste. The characters were annoying, the story was weak. When I end up wishing all the characters die and die soon there is a major problem. I hate this book. There are three in the series. I guess for those who plan to finish them (which I willnot) is that it can only get better and not get any worse but then I also said that at the end of watching ""Highlander 2""."
1,"If You Want Big, Fat Fantasy, Spend Your $ on Robert Jordan","Lord of the Isles and subsequent volumes (which I'm still not sure why I bought) read like those old D&D ""pick an adventure"" stories, where if you want the hero to rescue the maiden, turn to page 24.Trees died to make the paper for this book and its sequels. Their sacrifice was in vain.If you like big, fat, sprawling fantasies, spend your money on Robert Jordan instead."
4,a great adventure,"I really enjoyed reading this. The main characters were likeable and interesting, although I wouldn't go as far as the quote on the front cover. The story begins with four main friends who live in a secluded village. We are told of a magical force that is getting stronger and stronger by an old female wizard who has travelled from the past. The arrival of this wizard is the beginning of the change in all of their lives as they learn of the fate that they must lead. There is a lot of magic and a little bit of fighting, and the characters and storyline become more appealing as the book is read. I think a lot of you will like it as well!"
2,"Mindless ""entertainment"" if you've nothing else to do.","I picked up a hardcover copy off of a bargain table, so the story was worth the $ it cost. If you're looking for something to read other than the back of a cereal box, this book fits the bill. Besides the characters being incredibly underdeveloped, the storyline did little to pique my interest and the question of magic (origin, rules for use, etc.) was never fully addressed. If your looking for a writer like Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, keep looking."
1,Had high hopes but they failed to materialize.,"While I thought that the book had great potential I felt that it did not materialize. While the beginning started off quite good, the book went down from there, it seemed to be a lot of pages with no action, too much skipping around and didn't seem to be going anywhere."
2,Doesn't live up to the TOR legacy!,"Tor has always delivered what I thought were premier fantasy books. They have a way of discovering new talent, such as Terry Goodkind. I was hoping that David Drake would be another such find, but alas this was not to be.If you like detailed descriptions of rocks and trees and carpentry and metalworking. And if you are interested in knowing what every (and I mean every) part of ancient sailing vessels are named then this is the book for you.However, if what you like in fantasy books is development of characters, the comraderie that comes from a great quest, it ain't here, folks. I swear, at times, I felt like I was reading one random scene after another. There was simply no sense of purpose in this book. And I simply did not care very much for most of the characters. Several were interchangeable.Oh, well..."
1,Barley enough to keep me reading,"I am an avid fantsy fan and have read hundreds of fantsy novels, short stories, screenplays and the likes, unfortunatly this book ranks among the worst I have read. I say unfortunatly because I have really liked David Drake's writting in previous books he has written. But in this book, nothing good can be said. There is no real plausable plot. No characters worth caring about and the pace is unbelieveably slow. I tried to give Mr. Drake the benifet of the doubt and finish the book thinking that somehow it had to get better, but I was sorely disappointed. I can say, with an absolute degree of certinty, that I will never finish this series. I would strongly discourage readers from even starting this book."
3,Worth reading.,"I have one rule when it comes to Anne McCaffery; if she wrote it buy it. This book was over priced ($20 something - I think), even considering the author, but I bought it any way. Apparently I got a deal or Amazon has made a major typo ($299), because I checked the prices before writing this. This book is well worth the read, I liked it, but the original price was too high for what you got. It is a short story that I found very interesting, but regardless of the author I paid too much.Note: My rating of 3 is based on who wrote it and compared to other authors that makes it a 5."
3,A Quick Read,"The story was not as well developed as other McCaffrey works, but it was a fun book that was a quick and easy read. Good for those looking for a nice break from reality, but not for those who want depth in their characters and the world they live in. It was easy to put down and pick back up again as time allowed."
4,A Nice Little Furrytale,"The basic premise of this short little novella is that the very wise old regent of Esphania leaves behind a very special cat to help guide the young prince, Jamas, through the trials that he'll face as ruler of his country. The big trial that Jamas must face in this story is the danger presented by a sinister and ambitious queen who is willing to dispose of anyone who happens to be in her way. The cat is, of course, integral to the downfall of queen. The title is a bit of a misnomer, as Prince Jamas and some of his closest friends are well aware of the important part played by Niffy (the cat).Without delving into magic and wizards, it still maintains that essence of make-believe that all fairytales have. An excellent little book to read to children or a quick shot of feel-good reading for adults. There was no content that I would object to as a mother of a young child, but the writing has enough complexity to not bore a more mature reader."
2,Blue Screen of Death??? Is this guy from Stone Age?,"Extremely disingenuous title!Yes, Windows 3.1 was a piece of junk. Windows 95 was a junk with pretty good facelift, but... that was in the Ice Age. Did the author hear about OS called Windows 2000? Both at home and at work my main PCs are W2000. I supported bunch of heavy duty Windows 2000 servers and I have yet to see infamous ""Blue Screen of Death"". No luck so far.Maybe the book was written 5-6 years ago and the author just now had time to publish?I am not biased either way and in fact I am hardcore Unix fan, but I don't like gratuitous attacks especially when they are anachronisms.As to the content of the book it is very superficial even for the beginner and intermediate user. For that audience Peter van der Linden's Guide to Linux is much more superior!Gagné, you didn't gain much after year 2000, pardon the pun."
3,"A little boring, but overall good","This book was somewhat boring, but considering it was written by an amateur writer it was very well-written and original. Good for kids and country music/LeAnn Rimes fans."
1,Morbid and depressing,"This book is far from the heartwarming review it got from its co-writer, LeAnn. It revolves around bad times and death. Not to mention that the story idea is completely unoriginal. It stems from LeAnn's own life (even the title character, Anna Lee, shows Miss Rimes's lack of imagination) - from the death of her Godfather to singing at the Grand Old Opry. It can hardly be called fiction. It is a very depressing, morbid, unoriginal book, and like the movie, I do not recommend it at all."
5,Norpro Krona 1.5 Qt. Saucepan is Awesome!!,"I purchased this saucepan specifically for heating goat milk prior to making goat yogurt. It heats excellently, the milk doesn't stick to the bottom, there are no rivets on the inside of the pan (for the handle) for the milk to get stuck to like my other pans, and the added bonus of this pan is that it has a pour spout on both sides making it extremely easy to pour the milk into the yogurt maker container without all the spillage I used to experience from other pans. It also is made of stainless steel so it doesn't have all the chemicals that Teflon pans (which can cause cancer)do. This pan would be great for any other cooking too such as cooking soup, vegetables (easy strainer lid), etc."
5,"Nicely balanced, functional pot","I bought this pot for vegetable cooking (boiling/steaming). The handle stays cool and because of its shape, gripping it is stable. The handle on the lid is easy to grasp, even if handling with a pot holder (I'm not sure that a pot holder is always needed, but am adding this note to emphasize that the handle provides a lot of space between it and the lid). And the lid drain works like a charm and with the large lid handle, you can keep your arm well out of the way of escaping steam (possible reason for using a pot holder).So far, mine is clean and shiny. Don't know what it will be like years from now, but currently I am happy with it."
5,This novel looks really cool,"I am 12 years old and I think that this novel is going to be great.I suggest this novel because it looks cool.According to tokyopop.com, .hack A.I. Buster is rated 10 and older instead of 13 and older so this novel will be approprite for kids 10 or up."
1,Not much beyond the looks,"Purchased this for my 4th grader on August 1st. We weren't able to put the handle down easily, but we decided to overlook that as my son liked the backpack and school was already underway.Then, last week, I noticed that the backpack would no longer stand up. It seems that the braces along the bottom have broken and the backpack must now be leaned against something in order for it to remain upright.Definitely one to avoid, unless you're only expecting a 3 week useful life."
4,Great reimbursement response,"When I saw the Awestruck online, I thought it was what I wanted. But when I received it, there were little things about it's design that I, personally, wasn't happy with. So, I repacked it exactly as received - with everything intact, and enclosed a brief honest note for my returning the product. I went to the website and got my return authorization for a FedEx ground pickup, and off it went. Within a week or so I had my reimbursement deposited in my account. I was very pleasantly surprised and grateful there was no hassle. I would certainly do business with CalPak again. : )"
3,review,"While it is of adequate size and will hold up to what I will put it through, the part that is most frustrating is the piece of material overlapping the zipper on the main or largest pocket. This piece of material is getting caught in the zipper, while currently frustrating, once the material breaks down, I expect it to cause problems with the zipper itself."
1,Does not fit 5891,"I was misled by a review. In fact, it doesn't fit to Sunbeam 5891. So I have to return it and buy another one: 113494-000-000 from eReplacementParts.com. Too bad."
1,Not what it claims,I ordered this pan from Seneca River Trading for my Sunbeam bread machine model number 5891. Although it claims to be the correct pan it is NOT. It doesn't even fit into the bread machine. It cost $7.90 to return the pan which had clearly been returned before because the box had layers of return labels. I am not usually a complainer but wish Amazon or SRT would fix the incorrect information on the website so that others don't have the same problem.
5,Different View,Since I like Rabbi Berg's style and insight this is another book from him I truly enjoyed reading. It includes a different view than other Astrology books I have read from those that do not seem to adhere to an organized religious view.
1,TOP RACK SLIDES DOWN EASY!!!,"I am not sure exactly how much my mountain bike weighs, but it is reasonably light. No matter how tight I made the top rack, it slide down. Very frustrating- it maywork if you have feather weight bike!"
2,too complicated and hard,I have this and thought it would be easier and would store my bikes well...but it didn't. It is very dificult to take the bikes off the hooks and it does not look nice like the picture would lead you to believe. I would not recommend this.
1,Fundamentally Flawed,"Despite all the great reviews for this product, I'm very disappointed with the design. The hangers ""fasten"" to the center pole using an adjustable clamp made of plastic. Your bike is being kept in the air by the friction between the plastic clamp tightening around the slippery metal pole. If you own a heavier bike, such as most mountain bikes, you will find your bike sliding/twisting down the column no matter how tight you make the clamp, since there is nothing locking the clamp to the pole.Also, the product description fails to mention the maximum weight limit for the rack, which is 30lbs for the upper hanger and 45lbs for the lower hanger. Personally, I would rate the weights at about 20lbs/35lbs. Beware of this product if your bike has any weight to it."
5,Quick and Easy,"Product came on time, was easy to install, and works perfectly. Great product that I will absolutely recommend to others."
5,Another Excellent All Color Volume,"Like others in this series the book is color from front to back. As a result many classes of streetcar are missing, but I didn't miss them. Color makes the large well printed pictures come to life. The detail highlights the atmosphere of the time. A few pictures stand out and will stay in your memory or jog memories... truly artistic scenes, excellent composition and lighting. We can be thankful to the folks who bough color film and learned how to use it at a glorious time in our transit history."
4,Great information,"This book gives lots of great ideas on how to decorate inexpensively. I was so inspired by what I read that I decided to go ahead with painting an 1850's Belgian armoire white. I also painted my table white. And then distressed them both (with sandpaper and stain). I love my new look and all told (with additional items), I spent around $350.00 - for a beautiful new room!"
5,A DROPKICK OF TRUTH,AWESOME! THIS WAS A THRILLING RIDE ON A ROLLERCOASTER OF TRUTH.WRESTLING WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AFTER YOU SEE THIS.
4,Beyond The Mat - A Great Documentry,This is a great documentry on the life and world of profressional wrestling. I was very impressed on the way the movie was done and how it followed the wreslters behind the scenes. This is for wrestling fans and movie fans.
1,Terrible smell,"I purchased this after reading a desciption, stating in had light floral tones, very feminine, Quite frankly it is over powering and smells like it was intended for an elderly woman who needs to cover up other ""smells"". I would NEVER BUY this perfume again. deliverly was prompt and that is the only positive thing about this transation!!!"
5,I get this for my mom and she is really happy,"I make this a gift for my mom since this is the fragrance she use to wear, after a couple of months of daily use she is happy because the essence last all day, needs to apply smalls amount of the product so this bottle will last for her a long time."
4,Well worth a viewing...,"This 60-year-old fantasy about a British pilot who escapes death through no fault of his own, but who becomes the object of, for want of a better term, an angel hunt to get him to give up his life as scheduled, is intelligent and literate, humorous and thought-provoking. Niven falls in love with Kim Hunter, and she with him, which provides the pilot with an argument that he should be allowed to remain on earth and in the flesh. Who prosecutes him, who defends him, who judges him forms the core of the fantasy portion of the film. While the special effects are dated, as is some of the rhetoric, overall, this one satisfies."
1,very unhappy,I purchased this video for my son for Christmas. I had no idea that it would not play in our DVD player because it is Region 2. I called the company to return the DVD and I was told I couldn't. Not a great way to do business.
3,"Good Tuneage, but more like a radio listen of the movie.....","I have mixed feelings about this CD. I love Queen's music, and I loved the movie, even if it was a little hokey in places. So I really, really wanted to love this CD. Well, the music is still great, but it was as if they simply ripped the music while it was playing in key sequences of the movie, and kept the spoken lines from whatever character was speaking at the time. If they could have removed the spoken lines, it would have been much better. However, if you did like the music and the movie, it is worth a purchase. Shame they don't redo it though, this time sans the spoken lines."
4,What the.....?,"Imagine this hypothetical scenario. Back in the 70s, when Queen was at its peak and flounting its ""No synthesisers"" banner proudly, lets say there was a ""Nostradamus"" type who would predict that not only will Queen pick up synthesisers, but that all 4 band members would play synths making atmospheric music a la Tangerine Dream.You'd think he was crazy. But it happened, and it works in a listenably cheesy kind of way."
2,Not Much Variety - One or Two Good Songs,I'm not really into the dialogue mixed in with the music and the album starts to sound all the same very quickly.I do enjoy the title track as well as Vultan's Theme (which was used in the awesome arcade game Vanguard).
5,An Excellent Thriller,"An excellent example of a true thriller combining mystic Indian vs Christian beliefs. It was hard to put this one down, and is a book I have re-read several times. I look forward to her next work."
1,Lead can cause cancer!,"These memorex keyboards are okay. The hot keys won't work unless you install the software on to your computer, but the software is memory resident. So it becomes just another program that eats up your system resources. Also for some reason, memorex decided to put lead as a conductor in the keyboards cord, so you run the risk of getting lead poisoning each and every time you touch the cord. You will see a warning to this effect on the cord itself.That alone is enough of a reason to stay away from Memorex keyboards! Even though Memorex does make cordless keyboards, they lost me as a customer due to their reckless use of lead in their products.Not worth the money, not even if it was free. Buy another brand of keyboard. Lead can cause cancer.Russell"
2,disappointing,"These were very nice looking, but also disappointingly fragile. I've had wineglasses that were much more durable than these. We've had them for just under a year, and only half are left. We don't use a dishwasher, but one broke just by getting shifted on our bamboo dish drainer. Really frustrating and worrisome having broken glass routinely in the kitchen - I'm not clumsy, nothing else in the kitchen has broken in the year that 6 of these glasses have - I think that is a terrible indictment of this product and would have a difficult time recommending them to anyone for any purpose other than target practice."
1,Breaks very easily,Bought these on amazon last april and were down to about 5 glasses after 4 months. Every other washing in the dishwasher one of these glasses will break. We even thought that there might have been a fluke with the batch so we bought another set and these too are on their way out.
3,Why?,"Neal Schon has to be one of the greatest guitarists in the past 25 years. Starting with Santana and continuing through his work with Journey, Schon has one of those signature sounds that you can recognize a million miles away. The question then has to be, ""Why this?"" This new solo album features Neal covering pop songs by Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Bryan Adams (among others). I'm not sure that I really needed to hear Neal Schon offer his guitar take on ""My Heart Goes On"" (the ""Titanic"" song that won't go away....) True, his guitar playing always shines, but whether or not an album like this is needed remains to be seen. Neal Schon doing elevator muzak."
5,"Wow, what an album!","A phenomenal album, classic songs everyone knows with a stunning guitar lead! This is one intriguing album, something with hit material, but with a completely fresh new sound! This is for all guitar lovers that want to hear something distinct and different from guitarists! Full of passion, and completely NOT ""elevator"" music, Schon did this album wonderfully and tastefully!"
5,Voice of a Guitar GOD,"Neal Schon proves it yet again! Through his work with Santana, Journey, Bad English, Hardline etc. Schon only improves. His latest solo effort is in the same line of excellence. ""Voice"" is EXCELLENT, as is Late Night, Beyond the Thunder, and Electric World. One listen to ""Con Te Partino"" and ""Why"" and you will be hooked. Neal proves he can rock AND slow it down. Can't wait for Neals next masterpiece."
5,Instrumental guitar masterpiece!,"I absolutely love this album by the ever-impressive master of melody Neil Schon. Basically he has redone a collection of classic popular songs and substituted his awesome guitar playing for the original vocal lines. The song choices are good, the production is excellent, but above all the guitar playing is sweet as can be. All the songs are great but I particularly enjoy Schon's version of the Bryan Adams hit ""Everything I Do I Do It For You"" and I think his version of the Titanic hit ""My Heart Will Go On"" is special too. Other highlights include the Shania Twain hit ""From This Moment"", and the Mariah Carey hit ""Hero"". Voice is highly recommended to fans of guitar oriented instrumental music and also to Neil Schon fans who may have overlooked this side of his spectacular guitar playing."
4,Great disc!,"Neal nails the kind of guitar playing I can only dream about. Great leads, great melodies.If you like Joe light rock and great guitar work, you'll love this disc!"
5,Rebounder,This rebounder is a great deal. The price is right and it works great. Both kids use it. Daughter for soccer and son for baseball and soccer. Best investment we have made.
3,It's Okay,The net itself and it's size are fine. The ground stakes that came with it are cheap and inadequate. I've placed cinder blocks around the part of the frame that's on the ground to keep it stationary.
4,good as it can get,I am quite satisfied with my rebounder. My son enjoys it very much. He plays with it the moment he gets home from school until he is thoroughly tired. My other kids enjoys it as well. Can't be more pleased.
4,Exactly what I needed to analyze my operations,"The format of the book is great. It introduces business concepts and analysis techniques by real-life example. Many of these examples were directly applicable to my business. Whereas other texts like this teach you the theory, this book gets right down to real-world applications.I hear what the others say about the CD. They do have a point. However, I entered all the data myself. I wanted to learn the material by plugging in my own data to figure out how stuff works. I can see how this book would be frustrating to someone who would rather not have to enter the formulas and dummy data."
5,Great Book,Excellent...It really help me to better understand the data analysis with many differents case scenarios...exercises...its for everyone.
5,"Great ""Soup For The Soul"" Movie","This movie will touch anyone who watches it. Ryan Reynolds shows a whole school how a teacher should teach. Get the movie, a bag of popcorn, and a box of tissues. Enjoy."
2,Really wanted to like this movie,But just couldn't. I felt no connection to the characters and found the sotry line hard to believe.
1,Weak,"Schlueter is an average performer. His rhythms are weak if not wrong, so his style is correspondingly not strong. His sound is very mellow for a top notch classical trumpeter. Thumbs down."
4,A Beautiful Item,"This is a beautiful item. The copper and brass together make this an interesting paper towel holder for any kitchen. The base is made of copper and is not as substantial as I would have liked it to be, but the weights that attach to the base make it quite stable.The paper towels pull off the roll easily and the bar makes it easy to only get the amount of paper towel that you want.This item blends beautifully with other copper kitchen items and has given my kitchen a proffesional look. I quite happy with it and proud of the way it looks in my kitchen."
2,Too Much Brass,"This is kind of a stupid design. First, the brass color is like cheap brass you buy when you are a bachelor in an apartment (I know. I have been there). I think it is brass-painted plastic. You have to unscrew the top to put any roll down the tube. I threw it away once I got it. It's not worth paying shipment and packing. I tossed this quickly."
1,Poor quality,The Old Dutch Copper Towel Holder feels cheaply made. The base is very light-weight and tin-like. I purchased it for my newly-renovated kitchen but wound up putting in my basement bar. Not recommended for anyone looking for rich copper accents in their kitchen.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This has to be the shoddiest kitchen accessory I have ever purchased. It's wobbly, and the welds on the top decorative knob were so poor that the tines started falling out in the first week of use. Even with the top knob OFF, it was still an ineffectual towel holder.There is one in a brushed chrome that Costco is carrying now, that works great.Don't waste your money on this product"
2,"Ok Light output, great looking and looks durable, bad switch.","This light looks great, feels and looks solid, but the switch to turn it on and off is bad. I have to jiggle it back and forth to get it to come on, which makes it usable, but not a first choice. The price is good, but I have to look for something that is going to work reliably and I suggest you do too."
4,"Great, practical product","I have several of these flashlights, and they're brilliantly bright. I keep one in my briefcase, purse, bedroom (I live in Earthquake Country), car, and kitchen. Their push-button end is also handy. However, one of the flashlights was defective -- perhaps a burnt-out bulb. But, I returned it via a free mailer, and my refund was credited to my credit card."
2,Not what you're looking for,"I bought this flashlight with the expectation of exceptional brightness out of the light as was indicated by several reviews. There are 21 eyelets on the light - NOT LEDs. At best this does no better than a decent single LED light in terms of brightness. Also, the LED for my purchase failed after a very short lifetime (<8 months). There are much better options out there for less money."
4,push button - not on off switch,"Date: Nov 4, 2008 7:15 AMon the end where the black rubber tip is a press in area in ther middle - when it is pressed it is on - or if you need to have it on constant - tighten the barrel - all of my stock does not have a on/off button.-----Original Message-----"
3,So So,This book was that bad but hey it could be better.I never thought that the story line could be so cunfusing! Jeez the author could have put more effort into it but hey it was a good book in the end but don't hold your breath!
1,Incredibly poor quality of the vynil record.,Title says it all.I also have a CD and it sounds much better. It's alsmost as if the vynil is recorded from MP3
3,So-So Sleuthing,"This book, the first in this series that I've read, was okay. The plot was paper-thin, and there wasn't enough tension to keep me turning the pages. However, Swanson's writing is smooth.Swanson's characters need more development to make them compelling, and I felt that she treated them as naive country bumpkins. Just because someone lives in a small town doesn't make them ignorant or unsophisticated.Not a winner, but definitely in the running."
5,so true...,This book really describes the horror German civilians went through during theallied air raids!
1,Very Weak!!,"Dilated are average at best, they rhyme about the same ish. If you wanna hear a album that sounds like one long song get this, but if ya want tha real snatch the new Masta Ace,Cannibal Ox or J-Zone. Peace!!"
3,Worth the read,"Turkish Archery and the Composite Bow by Paul E KlopstegFirst published in 1934 the author has the desire to research the Turkish bow and its components. Formerly a technical researcher Klopsteg uses his vocational skills to tell about the difference between the wooden primitive bow and the superior Turkish composite. He notes the materials used and the time taken to make the best, the design and manufacture of the arrows, the thumb pull shooting style and the great distances achieved. Technical and comprehensive."
3,Kinks a lot,"This hose seems to work well - it doesn't leak or anything, but it does kink a lot, which means that you have to spend a lot of time undoing the kinks to get good water pressure. For a medium duty, I didn't expect it to be spectacular, but when you get a hose this long (100 feet), it should be constructed well enough not to kink quite so much. Overall, I'd buy it again because the price was good, but if you want something less stressful, go with a more heavy duty hose."
1,DON'T GET THIS BOOK!!,the engineer's guide to matlab is MUCH BETTER!! there are no good examples showing how to fully utilize each function. the book is very basic and probably covers only about 1% of the full capabilities of matlab. after using this book i was no better prepared to handle any homework problem than if hadn't used the book!! i am extremely disappointed!!
1,Not as discribed,"This claims to be a CLEAR cutting board. Wrong!! It has the pebbled look. I have gotten things from this seller once before and was not happy.Never again!!LAA, Salisbury, MD"
4,Good Size - Needs Protector Buttons on the Back,"We have tile countertops and seemed to scratch them up with stoneware plates so we bought some counter protectors a few years back at a local store. When we cracked one by setting a hot kettle on it, I needed a replacement. The kitchen store is gone so I bought this product online. If I recall right (it's been a year since I purchased), these didn't have those little clear rubber buttons on the back which level them and give a bit of protection to the counters. I bought those little buttons at the hardware store and glued them on."
2,Looking for glass lids that fall off?,Poorly fitting lid...seems like smaller lids from another pot were used for this item.Made the whole pot and lid system useless for us.We are not going to use a pot with a strainer lid that is so dangerously ready to fall off at any time.
2,Nothing to write home about,"I love any film that Roberto Benigni stars in or produces, so I was a little disappointed in this slow, half-baked love story. I was hoping it would get better as the film went on, but felt like it got dumber towards the end. Definitely not something I'd recommend, although Benigni's earlier film ""Life is Beautiful"" is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen!! Rent that one, not this one!"
4,I love Roberto,"Roberto has done it again. A gentle, loving, yet humorous story.Roberto Benigni has a sweet way of touching the heart of his audiences.Bravo!"
5,"sorry hellraiser,terrence is right",Operation live crime is one of the best live albums from Queensryche one the finest rock bands ever.each and every track is a gem.buy it.FED UP AND HELLRAISER ARE WRONG AS USUAL FOLKS.
2,European only,I was fooled by the fact that the cover said DVD and I did not see that it was for Euope only Be aware of this fact it is for Region one not for the US
5,Seckel Pears from Oregon,This is a family Holiday tradition we enjoy more with each passing year. Everything was more than perfect. Thank You
4,"Moves along, entertaining, quick read","Yes, I liked this book until Seattle fell victim to tsunamis. As all of us on Whidbey Island know, we're at the receiving end of the Juan De Fuca ""funnel of death"" if comet-induced tidal waves occur. Seattle is far from the coast and unlikely to be hit. Small geographical error in an otherwise good sci-fi thriller."
4,Deep Stuff! A book for Dads,"Many grief books are written by women, which makes it hard for dads to feel as though they can relate. This book is heartwrenching, emotional, and full of deep emotions and clinical healing."
5,Great pot,"I had this pot saved to my 'list' for a while before I actually broke down and purchased it. I wish I didn't wait so long. It is really handy when you need to heat something and then pour it. I originally looked it when I needed to replace my teapot but since I didn't drink a lot of tea I held off buying it, using a regular pot instead. I finally broke down and bought it and am so glad I did. I make yogurt, about 3 batches a week, and this pot is so great for that as well as other uses. It has markings on the inside of it for every two cups and the lid has two sets of strainer holes in it. I use for cooking small amounts of pasta, gravies, heating milk for cheese and yogurt, water for tea, etc. It holds up to 8 cups and is nice and deep, so when you whisk stuff around in it you don't splash it all over the stove. It's like having a really large pyrex measuring cup you can use on the stove top. I make soap too and this would be a great pot for that as well."
5,I love the mulit-pot,"I love the multi-pot. I can use it as a regular sauce pot, or a tea-pot. To cook pasta and strain. It is a very clever cooking utensil."
3,Lid is way too loose,"I purchased one of these pots several years ago and I love it. This time, I purchased two; one for our other house and one as a gift. The original pot has a lid that fits perfect. Both of the new ones have lids that fall off if not held on."
3,NOT Induction Safe,"This is a handy sized pot, but I bought it for use on an induction cooktop.Since it is advertised as 18/10 stainless, it should work, but it doesn't. Using this with a NuWave induction unit gives an instantaneous error. Magnets won't stick to it.Nice pot, but limited usage. I'm keeping it because I like it for general usage."
5,Taught by the Author,This text was used in the course of comparative politics I am currently taking with 2 of its authors. The book is quiet deep and is definitely not for use in teaching AP COMPARATIVE GOVT. Introduction is pretty long and boring.
1,Don't last long.,I purchased a double 75w pack of these bulbs. I use them for my uromastyx cage where the basking temp. has to be at 120 degrees and the lights on for 10 hrs a day. The first bulb I used lasted a little more than a month. The second one that I had used didn't even last a month. I feel that this bulb should last longer than this. I used the equivalent bulb from a different brand and it lasted months!
1,One Sided,I have a good knowledge of the history of Colombia and have visited the country. I read the book with an open mind and hope to gain a better knowledge of the country. I would say that this book is one sided with a leftist bias. It seemed page after page of conservatively atrocities and not much mention of what the Marxists have done. The book brought up all allegations of the current popular president Uribe and yet did not mention that las FARC hold three Americans since 2003 as well as other foreigners. It also failed to mention that Kidnapping is the second source of income for the insurgents after narcotics. The book also failed to mention that insurgent atrocities have provoked many of the reprisals that have gone on in the country. If you want to learn about Colombia don't read this book. Find an author that is fair and places blame on all sides who deserve it.
4,Lessons That Change Writers,"I am a 6th grade LA teacher and have been using this book as a resource to aid in teaching writing workshop. This book was recommended to me by other LA teachers when I took the Puget Sound Writers Workshop over the summer. As with any resource, it needs to be adapted to fit your student's needs."
3,Same ole,"Other than a couple of new songs, basically a re-hash of old songs, some performed by new vocalists and not done as well."
3,Be Interesting To See Where $ign of 4 go....,"While not as lyrically or sonically sound as UFO-Sharks, this release from frontman Phil Mogg backed by a band of fresh blood definitely falls into its own category. UFO fans will be pleased by 'Driven', 'Overload' and 'Song Keeps Coming'. All will be astounded and pleasantly surprised by 'Clap Hands', a Tom Waits cover that is served up with a slow build and willing fervor. The highlight of the album has to be 'Las Meadows Sanctum Divine' which lyrically reminds one that life is short and the good times must be LIVED to be enjoyed, if not remembered. If they make a go of it, $ign of 4 will prove an interesting band to watch."
3,Introduction to some new Stars,"I liked this film. I own this film. Yes, it ""stars"" Sylvester Stallone of Rocky and Rambo fame. He did a very fine job - a nice switch from the beat-'em-up movies he's been type-casted into.But what I like best about this film is that it ""quietly"" includes two individuals who are now big hits in Hollywood ... Viggo Mortensen of the recent trilogy Lord Of The Rings and Amy Brenneman of the current TV hit, ""Judging Amy.""I like both of these actors so I have a special appreciation for ""Daylight."" It was one of Amy's first films, but it was just one of many for Viggo. Viggo has worked a long time in film, quietly in the background, offering wonderfully crafted supporting roles. I'm excited that Viggo is now being casted as a Leading Star. Good for him. He is a fantastic actor."
5,esta pelicula esta de la concha de su madre muy buena la re,esta pelicula esta tan buena que me la voy a compra
2,Christmas Child DVD,"OK movie--I wouldn't buy it again. I thought that a movie about adoption would be interesting since, I, also was adopted. But it was a disappointment."
5,the christmas child,This was a great purchase. I loved it. I was worth the money and It arrived in good time. Thanks!
5,PAGE 85,"I wrote one of them, but page. 85 is very appropriate for me. Many vets are living prisoners of war. ""Only the dead see the end of war."" - Plato"
2,Still Too Heavy for Fine Hair,"I have fine, naturally curly hair that tends to frizz on the sides. I've tried many products for curly hair and often find that they either leave my hair too crunchy or they are just too heavy for fine hair. I wanted to like Bb Curl Conscious, but it really didn't do anything but make my curls heavy and too soft to hold a style, and did nothing to smooth out the frizz. So I'm going to pass on this one. BUT...My hairdresser recommended Moroccan Oil Curling Creme and that is what I use now. It controls the frizz better than anything I've used so far, and the argan oil actually adds body to my hair and my curls look *pretty* not just curly. It also smells fabulous without competing with my perfume."
3,Spray vs. Splash on,"I was very happy with the way the package was shipped and the timely receipt of it. However, unfortunately I did not care for the smell of the spray on perfume as much as I do the ""dab"" on bottles. To me the spray was just alittle to strong."
4,If you are a runner...,If you are a runner...and get tired of hearing the same old thing on your walkman then the subliminal messages embedded in these especially mixed tracks will take your run further and make it far more enjoyable(...)
4,Once Nice Picture,"I had to see this movie on last holiday , That's once nice picture. The movie try to say the natural in human less and if you can listen , learning , touch ... natural again ... may be the happiness that nearly you"
1,I wasted my money,The DVD I purchased will not play in any of my DVD players. It so put it in the trash !!!
2,TRAVOLTA WORKS IN OTHERWISE PASSABLE FODDER,"There are some occasional moments, but basicially this is borrow from last year's Powder, which is basically on the same plot. Silly."
3,good but not great,i think this is a pretty good movie i actually went to see it two weeks in a row when it was out at the movies.now i own the tape.travolta gives a good performance.as does everyone else.i disaggre with the other viewres who said that this is one of the best movies of all time its not that great.Intersting factoid. david gallgher who plays sedwicks son. also start with travolta in look whos talking now.
2,Not what I had hoped.,"After watching and enjoying a light sexy romp by Tinto Brass called Cheeky. I decided to try another Tinto brass movie. Alas, Miranda didn't do much for me. Miranda is eighteen years older than Cheeky and that might be part of the problem; softcore movies may have loosend up in the intervening years.But that wasn't the only problem. The women of Cheeky were generally more attractive to me. They were trimmer and slimmer as opposed to full figured and there were more of them. Underarm hair was shaved and the ladies pubis was trimmed in the latter movie.The stories were about equally dumb and the acting in both cases was average. Still Cheeky caught my attention while Miranda lost it."
2,Tons of fun...for a single use,"I read the reviews regarding poor durability but thought I would take my chances. My 2-year-old and her 3-year-old cousin had a blast playing with it over Dec. 24 and 25 at a relative's house. We packed it up and brought it home a few days later only to find that it deflated within a few hours. This is a fantastic idea but its really poorly made. We've tried to find the hole(s) to patch them with little success so we just re-inflate it if we leave it up in the carpeted basement. I would strongly *not* recommend this product, which is a shame since it's so much fun."
2,Jumpolene -Not worth the money,Fun but doesn't hold up for more than a couple of months. Seams separate and patching doesn't hold. I wrote to Intex; but no support from there either.
2,"Fun, but poor quality","Kids love this type of toy. It is one of the most sought after activities in my house. However, it didn't even take one day after filing up the jump-o-lene, that it started to deflate. I definitely am not getting my moneys worth!"
3,Lots of fun....til it pops,"My daughter got this when she was 3 years old and loved it. She jumped in it all the time, would run and dive in it, etc... she is small too, 25 pounds. It did last fairly long compared to some on here. 6 months or so we noticed the bottom channel was leaking. It was from the seam, and no patches helped. We could still inflate it every time she wanted to use it, but it only held air an hour or so. The side channels still all seem to be ok at least.Now it is no longer a jumpolene...but a covered fort. She loves to turn it upside down and hide with her stuffed animals underneath it. Like a big tent. Still useful as a big playhouse, but as a jumpolene is has been retired.Fun toy, but do not expect it to last very long as a jumper. We paid $31 or so with free shipping, worth that price, but would not pay $40+$20 shipping."
4,My 20 month old loves this!,We bought this toy for our 20 month old and he LOVES it! Christmas morning we set it up in our family room with 50 balls and he played in it for 30 minutes before he realized there were more toys under the Christmas tree. As soon as the other toys were opened he went right back to the jumpolean & spent a majority of the day in it. He has played in it everyday & it gives me plenty of morning time for 2 cups of coffee & the morning news! The top rim leaks air and I can't find the hole to save my life but I have a auto air pump to blow it up once a day. I highly recommend this toy for any toddler that has lots of energy & for mom/dad to have a nice break in the day for at least 30 minutes at a time.
4,kids love this,We bought this for our nephew for his 2nd birthday. He loves jumping in it and so do his counsins.
2,Not durable!,"The toy has a great fun factor, the kids loved to play in it every day - for about 4-5 weeks then it broke! The outer ring chambers are still fine but chambers in the bouncing middlepart broke and now there is one big hump and toy is very unsafe to use!Although the cost of the toy is very low,I am disappointed about the very short durability of the toy.If you want to buy it, be aware that you can only use it for a few weeks."
4,"So much fun, but tears easily","We got this jumpolene after our O.T. recommended it for our son to help ""get him going"" in the morning. It really was the greatest purchase ever....until it got a hole and started deflating. It's so much fun that we ordered another one right away but that one got a hole even faster. Even though it gets holes, we still love it and recommend it. We just pump air into it in the morning and it's totally fine for the kids to jump in. We use it as a ball pit too. Our 9 month old loves being in it also. It is big... it takes up half our living room, but it's been worth it."
2,not as bouncy as it appears,"We thought this would be a great alternative to getting an outdoor trampoline, since it would be safer. And we thought our kids would love it since they often want to jump on the bed. But this product is not as bouncy as it appears. My kids mainly arranged their stuffed animals in it and laid in it with them. After a few weeks it began to deflate. We patched it at the seam, but it still gradually loses air. It's been a disappointment and has been discarded."
2,Already Deflating!,"This is our second blow up item from Intex, and this one popped in even LESS time! We have only had the Jump-o-lene for one month and already the top tier is completely deflated, no matter how often we blow it up (with an electric pump, thank goodness) it deflates almost immediately. This reduces the height of the sides, thereby giving my son less of a ""barrier"" to prevent him from tumbling out, which thankfully hasn't happened. He does have fun in it, but needless to say I'm very disappointed."
2,Great Idea - bad quality,"We got this as a gift for my two boys, 1.5yrs and 2.5yrs. They absolutely love it and so do all their friends. This is a great toy for any child, BUT, as many others have complained, it will not last. Intex quality is not good. After only a few months of using it, we had holes everywhere. Mainly along the seems. This was used only inside and they were never allowed to put toys in it. So we did take care of it. I phoned the company and asked them to replace it but they were not interested in helping. Great toy but it will not last. So if you dont mind paying the money - then its worth it!"
1,don't bother. it busted the first day.,"I purchased the jumpolene for a preschool. The first time we inflated it, the seams busted. I tried to repair the leaks. By the end of the week, the entire thing had been destroyed. Not worth the money!!"
2,Not so great,I filled this up in the order it says to fill the chambers. It still is not bouncy. My two year old son goes in it but not to bounce. We put colorful balls in there which will entertain him for about 5 minutes. Maybe I'm not putting enough air in the jump o lene but it feels like if I add anymore it will burst. It says in the bottom chamber to fill only 2/3's of the way. I have no idea when it is only 2/3's full. I am dissappointed with this purchase and would not recommend purchasing.
2,do not buy,Do not buy this toy i got one for my little boy for X-masand he hates it when he can jump in it cause its yellow and bee's are alwasy by it so he can never jump in it.Its outside so when it rain so much water gets in it and its not real soft for them to jump in.i would have never of payed what i did for it.
4,"Kids enjoy it, what more can you ask?","Yes - I have had this up for 2 whole days and the top rings already have holes in them...somewhere. But you know what? My 3 y.o. daughter doesn't care. She uses it for playing in with her dolls, for reading books, for running around...I just pump it back up each time she wants to play (a total of maybe a minute for all 3 rings). Not sure how it got holes in it, but we do have a cat so who knows if she decided to climb in it...that is certainly not the products fault. If you want to buy balls for it, we bought 200 (at the store so they wouldn't come crushed already) and it doesn't even completely cover the bottom, so buy more! It is what you pay for, though make sure you are aware of the shipping charges...it pretty much doubles the cost you pay."
3,NOT VERY STURDY,I bought this for my two year old twin grandchildren. They loved it and their mother did too as it kept them busy. The twins were the only children to play in it. After only three months it deflated. It was only used in the play room. Their is no animals in the family so their was no reason for it to deflate. The kids were very disappointed so I would not recomend the JUMP-O-LENE.
4,Tyler-ized!,"If you like Anne Tyler's work, you will like this one too. She is an author that you either like her quirky characters or you don't -- I like them! I still think that ""Ladder of Years"" is my favorite."
3,A LET DOWN AFTER A GOOD START,I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS BOOK AND FELT A LITTLE LET DOWN. ITS STARTS OFF GOOD ENOUGH BUT LAGS AROUND THE MIDDLE BY THE END I JUST WANTED TO GET IT OVER WITH
4,One of her best novels yet,"This was my sixth Anne Tyler novel, and the only one I have enjoyed more is Breathing Lessons. Too often her characters are eccentric in an unappealing way, but in Patchwork Planet this was not the case. I would have loved to have heard much more of the life stories of Barnaby's elderly clients. The only character I found boring was his daughter. The dialogue and situations were natural and believable. I think if you like Anne Tyler at all you will enjoy this book, and if you haven't read any of her works yet, this would be a good one to read first."
5,"Divine entertainment; touching, loveable....","Anne Tyler is treasure. Wish she'd write a sequel abouta certain husband-and-wife team who inherit a helping service for the elderly.I think Sophia WAS Barnaby's angel...she was a kind of ""touchstone"" - he said she made him ""completely happy""at one point. She was kind of an ""omen"" for better - or perhaps more appropriate - things to come. She renewed his self-esteem. But the ending was perfect.Loved every single moment of this book. Thanks, Anne."
4,This book was good company.,I love the way Ms. Tyler writes. I enjoyed coming home to this book at the end of the day and having the characters be the last thing I thought about before I went to sleep. Books can dazzle you with great technical feats of word play and original ideas deftly laid out like literary banquets but in the end they MUST be good company and this book succeeded handily.
1,what was THAT about ??,"I read till the end because i couldn't believe there wouldn't be some kind of surprise ending or moral to the story. There had to be something to compensate for the boring pages. But I finished the last line, closed the book, put it on the shelf, and was left with NOTHING. What a waste of time ! Words, words, words...to no end !"
1,a NOTHING book with NOTHING characters,"Anne Tyler does have a nice writing style, but this book is just a bunch of nothing. none of the characters have anything going for them or anything interesting about them. nothing happens. don't waste your time!"
1,No stars,"In this thin bit of nonsense Anne Tyler confirms our fears. Getting old puts us up to ridicule and is painful and frightening.The weak, whining main character gets no worse than he deserves and even his ""big revelation"" at the end is as watered down as the rest of the book.If I had to choose between reading this book again and having to go to the dentist, I'm afraid I'd sprain something hopping into the chair."
3,Did I lose a couple of the end chapters?,"I have read and for the most part enjoyed all of Anne Tyler's books and really look forward to her new releases. As usual, I was immediately hooked by the characters and enjoyed the story line. I raced home from work each night to learn more about Barnaby, his job and his life. However, as I finished the book, it felt as though I had lost some of the end chapters. It felt like something was missing and I was disapointed."
4,"Fascinating, Often Hilarious Look at a Loser's Life","Barnaby Gaitlin, the protagonist of Anne Tyler's ""A Patchwork Planet"" is the quintessential example of a ""loser""; a thirty year old man who has lost himself in a meaningless, often thankless, job. Tyler does a splendid job in portraying Barnaby's ordinary odyssey through life, which becomes extraordinary when he unexpectedly meets Sophia on a Philadelphia-bound Amtrak train. Tyler has an amazing eye for detail and for creating wonderful, fully realized three-dimensional characters. Through her eyes the streets of Baltimore and Philadelphia have become as vivid and as well lived as those I'm familiar with here in New York City, replete with her compassionate, respectful writing about Barnaby and his friends, family and acquaintances. Without a doubt a pleasant read which will leave you laughing by the book's end."
5,"Easy, Simple","Great book, if you want to learn HTML - it will teach you. Simple to understand, step by step."
1,NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE INDUSTRIAL BAND!!,"If you are looking for the industiral band with a female vocalist you are looking for the CD ""Trixter"". This is a totally different Kidneythieves!"
3,Not the REAL kidneythieves,The reviews shown on this page from the various newspapers do NOT apply to this band! The original Kidneythieves split- this CD does NOT involve the same artists who were in the group during the early nineties- which is the time Tea & Apologies came out. That CD/ Cassette came out in 1994 from Stolen Songs Records. The lead singer for that CD is not even still with the group!
1,I'm still confused...,"Okay...so this band is a dude band? And the one with ""Trickster"" and ""Zerospace"" are a totally different band? Right? So...and the kidneythieves I like...w/ ""Trickster"" STOLE this dude's band name?????? If they stole the name, how did they manage to some out with so many albums then?And don't get m ad for my review...they sound good-just never heard them completely and I'm too confused to figure out how to rate them"
5,Sparkles!,Real Value for your money. It sits on the lobe of your ear like it belongs there and catches the light even when it's dim. Fantastic!
3,"An interesting, if bizarre, film","An intriguing interpretation of the now legendary summer Percy and Mary Shelley spent in Switzerland with Lord Byron, et al. I found some of the horror aspects a bit overdone, but the acting was quite impressive, particulary Gabriel Byrne. This is a film that draws you in, weaving fantasy and reality together in a nightmarish manner--very appropriate, really, for the birth of Frankenstein."
