2,Disappointed; a one sided approach to the problem,"Although the author does a good job of describing difficult mother/daughter relationships, she lays all the work to repair the Mom/Daughter relationship squarely on the Mom, over and over again. Do this, do that, etc. etc. She tries not to ""blame"" the Mom, but, throughout the book, tells Mom what Mom needs to do to repair the relationship. What about what daughters need to do? I guess, nothing, since they are difficult, thus the title of the book and they, the difficult daughters gets a pass. It's not a balanced presentation on how both parties should work to repair the relationship. Or perhaps, the author needs to give Mom a pass, and tell her not to bother, if daughter is so ""difficult"". She offers only one solid working suggestion for the daughter, not practical, if you live any distance apart, ask your daughter to go into therapy with you."
5,By far the best in the series,"I recently inherited a large library from my grandmother, and this book was among the novels. In a rush one morning, I pulled it at random from the bookshelf to take to work for some lunch-time reading. Once at lunch, I discovered that this was third in a series of books, but as it was either read this book or go bookless (which always ruins my day and results in a too-short lunch), I dove in. Luckily there is a short synopsis at the beginning of the book, which was really helpful. I went back and read the first two later, but really, I didn't feel like I missed out on anything by reading this one first.This book has the most ""magic"" of the series. I think it's the most clever, and it made me giggle the most times. A delightful grab off the bookshelf! I would (and have been, probably annoyingly so) recommend this book to anyone, anytime."
3,Like drowning in a Well ... and the Plot was a little Lost,"#3 in the Thursday Next seriesThis one didn't tickle my fancy anywhere near as much as the previous Thursday Next novels. I love the witty literary references and the madcap ridiculousness of the alternate world of Reading but this one wasn't a racy read.Maybe because the action took place in Bookworld (working for Jurisfiction) and was more about text and grammar (beware of attacking grammasites) and punctation (who stole all the punctuation from Ulysses) and spelling (with the misspeling vyrus) it all became a bit overloaded.Buuuuut ... I'll be ready (sometime) for another in the series just because Fforde has a wonderful way with puns and word play and are so imaginative. (#4 ""Something Rotten"" ... hmmm not sure how much I'm into Shakespeare?!)Loved the bit where the rabbits fro Watership Down have overbred ... but Lenny likes to come and visit them."
3,Lost plot?,"Jasper Fforde is as clever as ever in further developing Thursday's world, but for much of this book things feel seriously off track. The plot meanders and there were several times that I came dangerously close to putting this book down and not picking it up again. Instead of being sucked into Thursday's story I was content to pay the occasional visit and enjoy Fforde's latest clever concoction, but I never felt the compelling need to pick the book up and see what happened next. I wound up returning this book late to the library _ evidence enough that WOLP lacked the can't-put-it-down quality of the previous two outings."
5,Good movie!,"Good movie, even if your not a race fan the storylineis well scripted & addictive. The acting is pretty darn good too.It's not an Oscar winner, but I enjoyed watching it andwill keep it in my collection!"
2,Proctor Sylex 75400 canopener,Canopener motor appears to be working a lot slower than the previous one we replaced.
1,LEAVE WHALE ENOUGH ALONE,"This Icelandic flick is half book since you have to read much of the so-called ""dialogue."" In any language, this movie sucks.Incoherent...sloppily made..horribly acted...boring and unimaginative..pick any negative adjective and it will fit.Even diehard horror fans will gag!"
4,Shocking - apparently Appalachia as depicted in Wrong Turn has nothing on Iceland,"Wow. Do you think some Icelanders hate the foreign tourists? The stereotypes fly fearlessly in this movie like the flag on a pirate ship. Everyone acts terribly in the first half hour to establish that these are all hideous people. You've got the the khaki, burberry garbed Japanese getting away with murder literally in this movie (Yen Carry Trade brought down the Icelandic economy that set in the motion the current economic meltdown) and you've got smug Germans passing judgment on the locals AND the go to ingenue who is German does a Bjork impression in imitation of some Viking funeral song to escort the dead into the Netherworld.It's violent, gory, economical and effective. There is no sense that production values were skimped on but rather everything comes across as appropriately bare bones.I was delighted by the opinion of foreigners put forth by this movie. Vikings roar."
1,Terrible,"If you want to listen to Bell talk about how great he is and all of his accomplishments, this is the book for you. I took very little away from the book. I found myself disliking Bell after the first few pages, making the rest of the book very difficult to read. I literally laughed when I got to the chapter on humility, the last thing Bell should be entitled to write about."
5,They rocked the house down,"They showed up here at the University of Wyoming. I stopped in just to listen to a few tunes, and ended up on the floor with the rest of the crowd. Jana's vocals are amazing. She's a cross between every great female rock legend out there. The band played with amazing energy and kept us well entertained from the start to the end. They left us begging for more, and although they currently only have 2 albums, I expect there'll be more on the way.This band is a fresh reminder of what rock and roll really is."
5,WOW...It's STILL in my CD Player.,"I purchased ""Simply Jane"" on a whim just for the experience of hearing from an ""unknown"". I don't expect that this group will remain unknown for long. Their music has depth, emotion and remarkable range. Their original lyrics take the listener on a musical journey of universal experience. Any listener would be able to relate to almost every single on this CD. This is a first rate piece of work that should be a staple of every serious music collection. More importantly, if you enjoy really good music with well thought out and original lyrics, then you should buy this cd! What I want to know is, when is the next release?"
5,What an amazing story!,"This really is an eye opening story of the repression of women in Iran. It was very well acted and kept me on the end of my seat throughout. However, not approprite for young children."
4,Interesting foreign film,learning about how other human beings (especially women) are treated in the Middle Eastern countries
3,Boring,"I am well aware of Islam and many of its strict practices. So, the movie was boring to me. It will be of interest to those who are not aware of the derogatory treatment of Islam towards women by those who hold a stricter understanding of the Koran.Yet, I don't understand how a ""true story"" person knows what others are saying when that person could not possibly have been in situations where others have conversed. That is, I might write a true story about those who hate me, but I could not possibly quote what they are saying in secret or away from me. That would weaken my 'true story' claim.Nonetheless, the story is convincing and DOES happen in one form or another today as it has for millennia.Generally, the acting was very well done, especially by the women who were superb. But one young person was obviously aware of the camera. That young person's appearances are so few that it is not a problem."
1,"If you like being angry, this movie is for you!","Some have rated this movie highly because of the emotional issue that arises. The emotion is anger; the issue is injustice. While dealing with injustice is indeed a great life lesson, I don't want to sit down and watch it so vividly in a movie. I have never had so many f-bombs on my tongue as I have now. I hated this **** movie!"
1,Don't be disappointed like me!....,I purchased this CD thinking it was the original vocals. WRONG! The music has been redone by another artist and I purchased this CD thinking I was getting the original music by the artist. Boy was I taken. No where on the CD cover does it mention the mixes were not originally by the Flock of Seagulls. Very disappointed and a waste of money. I still have not found what I am looking for!
3,Good Book with the right Teacher,This book is quite good as an introduction to linear algebra with a nice mix of proofs and computational exercise. It has two main fault both of which can be corrected by a good teacher. The first is the horrible graphics (everything is in shades of gray and blue) that make it very hard to use them to supplement the text. The second is that in some sections they use non-standard notation for certain items and without a teacher to explain this you will not be able to understand what they are trying to say.
4,Very good reference tool for MOST parents...,"Unlike some of the previous posts here that didn't like this book- I thought it was great eventhough I didn't agree with everything. This is not a book for attachment parenting believers but for more mainstream parents. The biggest part of this is knowing that you should never take everything from a book - you can get some guidance but always refer to what works best for you. This books helps put you in the right direction - if that doesn't feel right then you need to inquire with other sources. There will NEVER be a parenting book that addresses all aspects or techniques because books are based on opinions, those who have posted bad reviews of this book obviously thought they were going to be justified in their parenting style by reading this book."
1,this is a worthless book!,"If I could give this book zero stars I would. This book is not helpful at all, in fact it gives blatent flase information that could be dangerous to your child! Do not buy this book!"
4,Baby 411,"I specifically chose this book because I relied heavily on Baby Bargains. In addition, since I didn't read this prior to the birth of my son, I needed something short, to the point given the fact that I have a VERY limited amount of time to actually sit quietly and read. The information is there, it's to the point, and it's very useful information."
3,not so clear,"This book could use some clarity. There's a lot of instruction on how to do a lot of things, but there's never a reason for why some processes are needed. For a beginner, this book isn't as easy as it should be. RoboHELP for Dummies was a phenominal book. This book hardly compares. The author, a technical writer, doesn't break down the why's and I'm left frustrated and starting over. It's too bad there's no real competition for a book like this. I really wish there was a more user friendly FrameMaker tutorial."
5,MUST have for 13 yr. old,Tired of bbs laying around? This product enables the loader to easily put many shots into a gun - and not onto the floor.
2,90% of the information can be found in Internet!,"Compilation from available for free information in Internet is according to be the best description of this book. The author himself states on the back cover that the book"" is catalogued from innumerable hours of research ..."" I wish he was expert enough to write original content instead of just browsing in Internet and listing this and that information."
4,What once was...,"There was a time that you could buy 24 of the large IVORY soap bars for practically the price of shipping...Those days seem to now be gone as shipping the dense item may have become cost prohibitive...i am saddened but now as i installed liquid dispensers on my sinks and in my showers, my melancholy has lifted..happy days are here again"
4,"Simple design, but the butter gets inside the top","I love the simple, classic design. Wish the butter didn't get on the inside of the top, but it seems like that's a common problem for all butter dishes."
1,"Look elsewhere, I must.","I was all right for awhile. I could smile for awhile. But, after about a year or so, and maybe 20 ""uses"" it crapped out. Motor burned up. Through no fault of my own."
5,A Great View Of Depression,"Having dealt with depression, I found this book (true story) very insightful. Those who haven't dealth with it personally, or those who have someone going through depression should really read this book. It's inside the mind of an older women with severe depression. Interesting, informative, and truthful. A must read!"
4,A Therapist Writes About Her Own Clinical Depression,"This book is an excellent first-hand account of one person'sstruggle with a serious clinical depression.Manning explores how her very sense of self is undermined bythis illness. Being a therapist, she understands the biologi-cal basis for this illness but the emotional experiece of itleads her to doubt her own reasoning in all capacities.She ably evokes the pain and despair that are depression'snamesake."
5,A King Solomon's mine of treasure for the movie fan,"If you're a fan of old movies and especially MGM movies, oh boy! Are you in for a treat! This is a marvelous book jam packed with so much information, pictures, drawings, trivia, and behind-the-scenes gossip, that it'll take you days to get through it all. Fortunately it's one of those sorts of books you can dip in and out of but I'll warn you now, once you dip in, it'll be hard to get out! Highly recommended for any movie fan."
1,Skeptical,Hold something in a glass jar in your hand and then be diagnosed with what you are allergic to? It is a far reach and this type of quackery should warn you as a reader not to waste your money for this type of nonsense. Don't waste your money.
4,Nice value,"I got my ball and am happy with it. Its not the very best as far as finish, etc. I suspect they are seconds. But it was worth the money and I would buy it again."
5,Yaay! my blender works again!,Item arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed to fix the terrific blender I purchased for $1 at a yard sale.
2,Good Luck,Good luck getting the old blade assembly out and this new one in. You'd be wise to note the exact order in which the many little parts are put together. I spent waaay too much time monkeying with this thing. I ended up buying a new blender jar with the cutting assembly already in it. A little more $$ but it fixed the problem instantly. Margaritas coming up. No hassle.
2,review,"i was dissapointed.. i would like to see a book published with numbers for the markers so one could look them up and dred the marker by number. the closest thing i have found is an i phone app, Texas Markers, its really good.."
2,When Selfish People Think They Can Write (books like this become bestsellers),"First let me get into the literary values of this book: None! Secondly, when the Houston Chronicle writes 'told simply' readers should know that they're in for a 12-grade writing level.There's nothing but selfishness permeating this book. On top of that, it is written so badly, it hurts. He managed to make me want to finish the book for two reasons:1) It is against my principles to start a book and not finish it (except for Pamuk's 'Snow'- so much for Nobel Prizes)2) I wanted to see exactly how far this self-righteous memoir-writer's self-centrism really went. I discovered to my dismay, it went too far.That being said, if you really want to learn more about Communist China during Mao's regime, grab a history book (I know I will)."
4,Insightful and motivating,Li Cunxin's detailed autobiograhpy provides astonishing insight to life in china (which is still very much unchanged for vast amounts of people in rural china) and policital education. It gives hope to peole who face the same (or even lesser) challenges in life. I have the utmost respect for Cunxin.
3,not quite sure how i feel,i actually only found out about this group from doing a search on tunde adebimpe from the movie jump tomorrow http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009Y3NC/qid=1113243308/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2206812-3008105?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846
3,The DVD(s),"This item (from Planet Bollywood) is not as shown in the picture. Picture shows a different type of packing, I received in a very different cheap type packing. DVD(s) once taken out will be loose. You will have to buy an album or case to keep them. The original genuine packing contains Had bound album and the story details with each DVD. Not the one I received.I played one DVD, that played good."
1,Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder,"I was pleased with the African American Women Knowledge Cards, The Civil Rights Movement Knowledge Cards and the African American History Knowledge Cards(tm)Pomegranate, however, the African American Art Cards were very disappointing; in brief, a poor selection was chosen to represent African American Art. Nevertheless, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.African American Art Knowledge Cards(tm)By, BJH 1Corinthians 13:4"
1,Don't buy,I recommend not spending the money on this version because it does not have any notes in it. There are a lot better choices out there that are easier to understand.
3,Difficult to understand,It is not easy to understand the old style Eglish to non-native foreigner like me. But I read it cover to cover.
3,Not for me,First I'd better explain my reasons for the three stars. This book didn't do a lot for me because of my own inability to understand Olde English. I don't have the version I read of King lear listed on amazon so I don't know if other versions are dumbed down for the lies of me or if they're all in Olde English. I needed to refer to Amazon reviewers twice to understand what was going on. And although I could write down a pretty accurate summary of the plot I couldn't become emtotional at all while reading it due to having to work out what I was reading. I read this book due to the feeling that I'm missing out on something and I still feel that now. I would advise people like me to find a modernised version if they can and good luck.
1,Most Foul,"The title page is not family friendly, it contains foul language. I purchased 4 large print books from Loki's Publishing, King Lear, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice and Hamlet. Only Hamlet escaped with a family friendly title page. Amazon please ask Loki's Publishing to stop the bad language. Thank You"
5,Check out this author,Very good play. I think this will be a classic. Don't miss this emerging British star. Some of the lines are destined to be used time and again in every day conversation. Buy it.
4,good fun sci-fi,"I love this series, no its not Star Trek or as good as a lot of other stuff out there, but a little gem of a find in itself. With occasional nods to other sci-fi programs, it is a show that is fun and a great rainy day watch."
4,Great set but...,"To be honest, and Im sure MGM will do this, wait until they put all the series on blue laser DVD - Blue laser DVD players just came out and when they expand and replace red laser DVD's you will be kicking your self for not waiting - because of the storage capacity Im sure they could fit an entire season on 1-2 DVDs as opposed to five."
1,Freedom of Press = Treason,"I never understood the slavish adherence to the idea that the Stargate is a secret to all Earth. Seems like having a space ship is more a threat to the show's formula than the idea that Earthlings knew about the Stargate. It's as though that element of the show is the key to everything. In the end, it simply doomed the show. There is nothing plausible about it. There are a lot of people who ask questions and many of them not only don't care what the government thinks about their opinions, they want to confront and challenge the authorities. Billions of dollars do disappear, but people are not content with ""classifed"" being repeated a thousand times. This is the weakest element of all of Stargate. It mystifies me that they kept it up for more than a dozen years."
1,Not their best season,"There were some good episodes in the 6th season - Abyss, Paradise Lost, Unnatural Selection, The Changeling and Full Circle. But I was very disappointed with the season as a whole. Poor writing, boring cliched plots, the absence of Daniel Jackson and the presence of bland Jonas Quinn makes season 6 my least favorite Stargate season so far."
1,A Massive Blow-Out on the Fast Lane of Sci-Fi TV,"The character of Jonas Quinn joins the crew of SG-1 for one mercifully short season. He's a man of many talents: He can hold his breath a really, really long time; he has an incredible ability to read and memorize a lot of books; he smiles a lot; and he can put a viewer into a light doze in absolutely record time. I still can't fathom why the showrunners decided to introduce an alien character who looks and acts no more alien than a Kansas-born farmboy. It was a genuine relief to get Dr. Daniel Jackson back. Thank heavens they finally listened to the fan outcry!"
4,Love the stargate series,"Love the Stargate series, however the earlier seasons are the better. The original cast has been great, and I did miss Daniel Jackson the year he was off the show."
5,I THINK IT WILL BE VERY GOOD AND I WILL TILL YOU AGAIN AFTR,I WANT TO GET THIS TAPE IN (PAL&SECAM - SYSTEM) PLZ.
5,My all time favorite,"Although the module series lost steam towards the end (The Final Enemy was a little boring and predictable), this first module promoted creative thinking instead of mindless violence which has been more too common in today's role playing games. Combining exciting adventure and diplomacy in a dark, eerie seaside setting, uncovering the mystery of this one was more fun than any other I've played."
5,Scraper,"An excellent product manufactured in the USA and a great value. This is an excellent example of what quality manufacturing is about, offshore manufacturing has decimated the industry. Made in the USA is the way to go."
5,For the faint of heart,"Not too keen on studying theory? Find yourself feeling a little sick at having to take on the likes of Foucault and Derrida? Wishing there was an easier to way to grasp theory? Read this book. It is wonderfully readable and accessible, and refuses to be condescending to those of us who must study theory but would prefer not to. This is not only informative, but useful."
1,A mangled shadow of a great movie,"The story is of circumstances that make it possible for a singer (Julie Andrews) to pretend to be a man pretending to be a woman. "" ~ Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive ~ "" Sir Walter ScottRight off I must say I miss Robert Preston. Naturally this is a play and not the movie so there must be some allowances. Unfortunately the play mangles the story more than necessary. Also the actors have no charisma or pizzas. The vocal ranges including Julie's are pitiful. The characters and actors just do not mess. The original story was placed in Berlin (Viktor und Viktoria (1933.)) When Blake Edwards moved it to Paris he added his signature slapstick distraction. They had an opportunity to remove it for the play. Instead they just added more Keystone Cop type slapstick. The few new songs barely replace the classics from the movie.You can still get a copy of ""Viktor und Viktoria""(1933) from Amazon.deVictor/Victoria"
1,WHY NOT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE ON DVD?,"Why ever in the world would they NOT make the original movie available on DVD? Hello, BLAKE, what's the deal? :) I want the original classic!"
1,Nasty surprise.,"This is one of those awful musicals (nasty surprise),not the great movie that I saw back in the early 1980'sstarring James Garner, the late Robert Preston, and JulieAndrews. I really got burned on this. I'll check moreclosely next time."
5,Andrews is Wow in Superb Victor Victoria,I was lucky enough to see Julie Andrews on Broadway in Victor Victoria - early in the run and late in the run. Her radiant performance gave me two of the most memorable evenings of theater I have experienced. How lucky we are for this beautifully-mounted preservation of the stage production. This is the best video of a Broadway show I have seen - and a tribute to Andrews' ever-shining star.
3,Not for beginners.,"Despite the back of the book as suggested for Beginning to Advanced students, this is not something I would wholeheartedly recommend. It is more for the Intermediate and above.There is a lot of detail given, but the manner in which it is presented leads to more head-scratching than moments of revelation. If you are just starting out, choose another book. If you need a reference, pick this one. If you're not sure where you fall, take the safe path and read reviews for other books."
2,Not a good toy.,I had a similar one when I was a kid. I was very surprise to see the price.I realized that there is no cheap and good quality stuff as soon as I received it.
2,Too difficult to use,I bought this for my 7 year old son. He isn't actually able to use it and neither am I. This may be because neither of us have good eyesight and it doesn't seem to work well with glasses.
5,big cats rule,I dont know why everyone is so geeked over the wolf shirt. Dont they now that in a fight the big cats would totally dominate on three stupid lonely wolves. And not to mention that the snow tiger is a good sexual omen!I rest my case.
2,Not a good ball stand,Received this stand all broken in lots of pieces. Seller sent another one that wasnt broken but finish was chipping off. Used one season outside and most all of the finish is gone. Its for outside so not sure why its this way.
2,not great when heated and toted,"I was so excited to buy this product because I really needed something I could tote to parties and such, with my much demanded various appetizers. This doesn't work very well when heated. The top gets all loosy goosey when you heat it, put the top on and put it in the tote. To me, that's EXACTLY what it should work with but sadly it does not. It's not bad for cold, thicker dips but I wouldn't recommend making a hot dip in it and toting it to a party without expecting spillage in the tote."
4,Good product at good price,Like I said. Good product at good price. Only reason for the 4 stars is that I haven't used it yet so i don't know how it travels. Seems fine though and I'm glad to have it for when I need it.
2,Not worth your time,"Everyone loves changing their oil & filter right?Nope - It's something that has to be done & we do it.However, Purolator filters are are not very good at filtering your oil.I have run Wix filters for years with no problems or complaints.I run Full Synthetic Motor oil and chance oil & filter every 2800 - 3000 miles.My engine oil had always come out clean, almost like new looking until my Wix dealer had to Special order me a case of Wix filters, thus I purchased these Purolator filters.After running 600 miles I checked my oil level and found my oil to be filthy.I changed the oil and filter using a new Wix filter, after 2862 miles my oil was like brand new.I'll pay the extra $ for quality!"
3,Fur Real Friend: Lion Cub,"I think they are just trying to make more money by making all these baby animals. Like the nweborn dog, cat, bear, and bunny. Now a lion.They all do the same thing, and even that, I think, is not really anything. For a small child I can see how they like the (ie; newborn dog) dog because they can carry it around, pet it, ect. But one thing that I find a little wierd is that they are hard on the inside. Hello, maunfacturers! Most little kids like to sleep with their toys! Make a dog plushier next time!But I do think they captured the aspect of a newborn dog/cat/bear/rabbit very well: they don't really do anything."
4,A Road Well Traveled...,"Having only recently discovered the well-spring of Van Morrison's talent, I am thrilled with this CD. While it does seem to me more mainstream than Hymn to the Silence, it is no less poetic, genuine, and skillfully rendered. I can't even pick a favorite - the whole CD flows; joyfully at times, sometimes rebellious, then again, with melancholy wisdom. Morrison's trademark is his unique hybrid of philosophical poetry. His music often invokes a melancholy central to the philosopher's journey, but without cloying sentiment or regret - more like a Socratic playfulness. That is what I appreciate about his music...Kind of like ""yeah, it's kind of confusing, and sometimes it hurts just to think about it, but hey! whaddyagonnado? - you gotta LIVE!"" These songs may not be complex, or long, but to me they are heavy with spiritual (and musical) fruit."
4,Vintage Van For The True Fan,"Dissing Van for sounding like Van -- a tack taken by some reviewers of this CD -- is like whining that Babe Ruth was one dimensional because all he did was hit home runs, or that Pablo Picasso's portraits didn't look like real people. Van is what he is. As anyone who's listened to even just one of his albums can tell you, Morrison abhors hypocracy more than any other human frailty. Pretense and dishonesty are simply not in the man's musical nature. Why some ""fans"" would expect or want some kind of mid-life musical metamorphasis from him escapes me. Down The Road is Van Morrison doing what he has always done best: distilling his own special blend of blues, rock, country and jazz to near perfection. This CD doesn't have a klunker on it and is solid evidence of why people continue to flock to Van after all these years. Don't be dissuaded by the nit-pickers and nay-sayers. If you like Van, my prediction is you'll like this CD -- a lot."
4,A Fork in the Road,"What can a devotee expect from the man who has some thirty albums to his credit? To constantly reinvent yourself after three plus decades could only be done by Van the Man.No one has the chops to reinvent Ray Charles save for Van. His version of Hoagy Carmichael's ""Georgia"" has moments of brilliance where Van shows he still has ""fire in the Belly.Shuffle tunes, ""Down the Road"", ""Choppin Wood,"" and theexceptional, ""Hey, Mr.DJ"" showcase Van's penchant for saxophones and strings and organ. His roots are in the blues and this Road takes us there.New Orleans is given its due with a lyrical interpretation and solo by famed clarinetist, Acker Bilk.Probably not his ""best""album but certainly worth the purchase.....the Irish/Celtic/Angry/Blues veteran has returned to a mellower pathway.Good to have a new album with that splendid voice that evokes nuances and phrasing like no other......repetitive and growling and mellow and as we have also come to expect, musicians who complement this icon."
3,Can't turn it off!!!,"I always thought Hymms to the Silence was a brilliant album, something I've always loved to play on Sunday morning while whiling away the hours around the house, sometimes in repeat mode on the CD player, listening over and over again.However once this CD was downloaded on my MP3 player, I can't turn it off, I actually keep the headphones on in the car or at work. This is a must for any Van Morrison fan, or anyone who just loves to tap their feet, bop their head, or just feel kind of sentimental about music again."
2,"Perhaps Works as a Textbook, But Not for Those Grieving","I ordered this book and waited for it eagerly, based on ""Search Inside"" reading I did on Amazon. I hoped the chapter devoted to guilt experienced by ""animal guardians,"" as the author considerately calls pet owners, when euthanasia or an accident precipitates a pet's death would speak to me. Therefore I was surprised to find the book more clinical than inspirational. I also found it emotionally distant from its subject...which perhaps is to be expected, considering that it was written by a psychologist. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone suffering from deep grief over a lost pet."
2,waste of money - just get a newer version of a crockpot,"I don't know why on earth I got this product?Instead of wasting money on this, I should have just gotten a newer version of a crockpot that already has the same function..."
5,The Artistic Wizard That is Frank Frazzetta,"What can I say about Frank Frazzetta that hasn't already been said?The man is a visionary of our and any other age.I recommend this book not just to any Frank Frazzetta fan, but any fan of fine art, of the visualazation of the imagination, and a fan of the wonders people can produce.This book gives detailed insight on many of Frank's great works and commentary from Frank himself! Great to read over weeks and even greater to marvel at over a lifetime!"
3,Review,Zahrah the Windseeker was about a girl who was trying to save her friend from a poisonous snake bite. The majority of the book was of her in the Forbidden Jungle. The book was fine and her goal wasn't easy and she wasn't overpowered which made it good. I see no good and bad in this book-Which is why I rate it 3/5.
3,"Good info, poor quality","This DVD instruction video does provide some good information but is poor in quality and very amateurishly done. It missed some vey important steps and operations of the camera. Also doesn't show or tell anything that's going on in the viewfinder displays.From what I've seen so far, no one manual or video tutorial covers everything about this camera. I have already amassed a small library of books and videos on the D70. Every one has some bit of new information that the others don't have, and this one is no exception.You will learn some news things from it.So I recommend this DVD only as an addition to the manual and other D70 tutorials, not as the sole source of your info.Rick HogueGulf Breeze, FL"
5,Good stuff!,"Without a doubt, these books by the Thoenes are the best works of historical fiction that I have ever read. Through the experiences of the books' characters, you will become a witness to the world events leading up to the Second World War and the establishment of the State of Israel. These books are fun and easy to read, and provide a very accurate historical background for WWII. You will not be able to put these books down!!!I also recommend the Zion Chronicles series and the Zion Legacy series."
3,very messy,"This product works very well, if you wish to deal with the mud residue. It was very messy and it was very hard to get the residue off of my stainless steel sinks in the house. I also purchased this product for my grandson and it was too strong for his skin problem. Therefore, its a good idea to put an age limit for its use."
2,It's old!,"This book was written to help the average user with techniques, hints, etc, for learning to use the Dragon.However, it was written, in 1999, for Dragon NaturallySpeaking version 4!The current version is Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8.0, which is quite advanced.There have been so many improvements in Dragon Naturally Speaking, since the book was written, that much of the information has become quite dated, and much-needed newer information is, of course, not included.I bought this book unknowingly, when I was using version 7.0, and it did not address my needs.Until they update this book, or write a new one, I would suggest buying a different book. Spend your $20 on something that will be useful!"
3,"Good Ideas, Corny Presentation","Many of satir's ideas about the family structure and how people work in general hit the nail right on the head but the way she presents them just make me laugh because they are so corny. A lot of her ideas about the different types of people and how we react to one another are really helpful but all the little experiments and little pictures that are in the book are so laughable they can't be taken seriously. In general the book was good, it achieved it's goal of being a book about how to improve your family and if you can put the sappy, corny language aside it really can help."
4,very cool,The book was a gift for my grandson. The book can be flipped through over and over again. It is in a simple format but with great pictures and information clips.
4,Nice!,"This book is filled with cool pictures of real equipment. Also, it has a lot of info in it as well."
2,The Finnish Private Ryan,An accurate depiction of a brief period of Finnish history. I give it a low rating because the indoor scenes do not have true color.I was charged postage for this DVD. It was advertised as free shipping.
1,citrus juicer,The Metrokane juicer was nice for the first couple of days and then it sprang somehow and no longer works properly. I am very disappointed. Ce la Vie!
5,Lataji's concert - Shraddhanjali,"Absolutely awesome!!! A huge selection of songs sung by Lataji over the years, a few medleys included. Lataji sounds ravishing even at 73 years!! A must buy.."
4,How To Be A Villian,"A quirky little book that I read to my eight year old son. We have lots of laughs at the humor ( sometimes silly, sometimes dry )."
2,Could have been much better,"While this is a good humor title, it is still lacking in substance. It tries to pull off some cliche shtick, but falls flat most of the time. I think one of the problems is it doesn't take itself seriously enough. If this was written as though it was actually advocating being evil, it might have worked. As it is, the author's tongue is so into their cheek, it has squashed all the humor receptors in their brain."
4,My 14 yr old son says this is Freakin' Awesome,"Received this book as a gift, but it was more suited to my 14 yr old son. He thinks:Great fun - very humorous. Pretty quick read. Enjoys using some of the villian suggestions in school."
2,"Too light on humor, too thin on style","I know humor is subjective, but I just didn't laugh at this book. I might have chuckled once or twice, but all in all it doesn't stack up well against a lot of similarly themed (and titled) books that do a much better job of parodying the self-help manual. The tone never felt right, and it seemed like the author didn't have many ideas. This is an odd example, but one thing that made the book feel thin is that the illustrations (quite nice, btw) were captioned with a direct quote from the text, not even a rephrase - no additional jokes were written.I don't want this review to come off as mean spirited or anything. Ultimately this book is best described as harmless - which for a humor book is never a good thing."
5,Better than expected,"I purchased a very good Rival 3-liter deep-fryer over the internet and filters are not available at the local WalMart. The product description is inaccurate: with careful placement I easily cut 6 charcoal and 3 grease filters. The grease filters are thicker than the one supplied with my fryer, and I have to consider that a good thing. Overall, a better value than the description would suggest. If you use your Rival deep-fryer as much as I do, you need this. (I use light olive oil to fry - makes french fries that are actually *good* for you!)"
2,Thank you TNT,"TNT now has a history of ruining great shows, starting with The Pretender continuing to the final season of B5 and ending with Crusaders.I hove no doubt this could have been a great show - it did start to pick up toward the end of the run, but compared to the first 13 episodes of B5 this was lacking."
4,A good beginning,"This was a series that had potential, and it was very disappointing that the plug was pulled before it could really expand on the Babylon 5 universe. Jeers to the network for canceling it prematurely. I would recommend this just to complete the Babylon 5 universe DVD collection."
1,SNL Parody or Science Fiction?,"This series was sooo bad, I thought I was watching a SNL parody with bad lines, corny plot, and terrible acting. Please don't spend money on this DVD, if you absolutely must rent it from Netflix and spend the 20 bucks on something good like Firefly."
4,"A Fairly Good Show, Needed More Work",A fairly good spinoff of Babylon 5 just needed more work to sort things out.My biggest complaint is that the pacing was off. Also the special effect were a bit too ambitious for the era and the budget of the show.
5,"Unique sauce, great service. Amazon is amazing!","I was introduced to this local hot sauce while on a trip to New Orleans this spring. My daughter knew a chef that she had worked with, he had opened his own restraunt, and my wife and I had a fabulous dinner there one night. His baked beans were excellent, and he shared he uses this local hot sauce in it. I like hot sauces, but am not too crazy. This was not so peppery, and did not leave my mouth blazing, but did have an earthy, smokeyness to it. I bought a bottle while in the Cresent city, and when I ran out, didn't know where to purchace more. Amazon to the rescue! You can find anything on Amazon. Thats why I say it is amazing. I purchaced two bottles of this Crystal sauce, and will always turn to Amazon for other heretofor items that my local store does not have. I live in the Pacific Northwest, so cajun sauce is impossible to find. Except on Amazon!Don"
3,Not Up to Usual Taschen Standards,"I was hoping to purchase a book that concentrated on the early examples International Style 1919-1939. The focus of this books is post World War Two and more particularly the iconic buildings of the great architects. There is nothing wrong about seeing more examples of the works of Mies, Gropius and Le Corbusier. However, they influenced a great number of other architects who produced some very interesting buildings. A style is a lot more than the creations of a few masters.I love most of the architecture books published by the German Publishing Company, Taschen. However, this is not one of their better books. I found the text to be superficial and the photos not up to their usual high standards.For anyone interested in learning more about early modernism and more specifically the International Style, I would recommend another Taschen book, ""Architecture in the Twentieth Century"" by Peter Gossel and Gabriele Leuthausser."
5,Unity Sand Alternative,"I used this for my wedding for the unity sand - we hot glued the front and back plates down, placed a picture on the front one, and poured our sand in this instead of a vase. It's gorgeous and we received a ton of compliments on how amazing it looks. It has leaked some sand from the bottom of the glass, but I'm pretty sure that was our fault for not gluing it more (though we did a TON of hot glue... you might want to try something else) Either way, it's fabulous!! :)"
2,Good Product - Bad Packaging,"The product itself was great, but it was very poorly packaged and several layers of the glass were shattered during shipping. I would not recommend purchasing this item online, best to find it in a store if you want it in one piece."
5,"Gysbert Japix, Lieten, Lieeren, Songs",I found the selections very beautiful. I am glad old music is preserved in this way. It is well worth a listen.
1,RIVAL CAN OPENER,I have a Rival Can Opener and it WILL NOT open cans!!! It will not even pierce them. It is totally worthless! I gave it one star only because the review system made me click on something. It is not even worth 1 star!
4,ok,gloves are warm. thumb is to long. otherwise the fit is good.and are comfortable to wear and stands up to abuse.
4,Bionicle Mask Of Light: The movie,"This movie is cool! The only drawback i sthe animation. Tahu, Gali, Lewa, and Onua don't look like they do on those toy commercials. About the only two Toa Nuva that look okay are Pohatu and Kopaka. But still, another animation drawback is the Rahkshi. What's up with those messed up heads when the kraata comes right through it? That was disgusting! Anyway, Takanuva's creation doesn't follow the comics, and his voice sounds like a girl's. He also looks like Onua with gold and white armor, but the mask is like exactly the same!Overall, this movie is good. It may be scary for little kids, but it's pretty cool for older ones. Anyway, I'm sureBionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui is going to be much, much better. The Toa Metru are better, anyway.I reccomend to first rent this movie, watch it, and if you like it, watch it again, then go and buy it!"
3,Bionicle - Mask of Light,"This film, is definitely for Bionicle fans only, and I, being one enjoyed it.If you are not a Bionicle fan, be warned, it will be nearly unwatchable, the scrpit was not all too great, the visuals were a bit choppy. The story of the film itself is decent, but it will not be understood if you are not a Bionicle fan.Bionicle fans will be pleased, as long as they aren't expecting theatrical quality. The story keeps true to the storylines previous, and you may find it above expectation.The only fantastic thing about this movie is the soundtrack, it literally compares to that of Star Wars, it's intense! It has a great main theme, along with awesome later tracks. They really should release a soundtrack.5/10"
5,The Great JB,What a great Guitar Player! The beginning is really cool watching James walk around 48th Street in NYC! Then the way he plays is like magic! He starts out with this blues thing man it sends you to a different way of living! The DVD has great features like slow motion! Any guitarist would be crazy not to get this one !
5,finally !,"ok, we had to wait a long time for the new album of marisa monte (we could enjoy work of her with carlinhos brown on his 'omelete man') but finally, it has arrived, marisa's new album... it's everything i expected and much more... for the first time, marisa monte plays the guitar (on the songs she has written or co-written). as always, she has got a little help from her musical 'friends' like arnaldo antunes, carlinhos brown... this is marisa at her best ! muito obrigado por sua musica marisa !"
1,do i have to give it a full star?????,no problems getting battery cover on.......got good at that cuz if the batt. shift AT ALL it stops working!!!! Fabric looks exactly as it did before so all that work for nothing.
1,Jumbo Super Lint Buster is a BUST!,Very much like the other small lint shaver I purchased - I pretty much hate myself for making this purchase. The product did absolutely NOTHING to help me. It made alot of noise and did alot of nothing!!! I am completely and utterly dissapointed with this product. If you're reviewing this trying to make a decision on whether or not to buy this product - let me help you DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT will only make you angry!
1,Doesn't do much,"If the lint or snag on your garment is giant/very long, then MAYBE the lint shaver will cut it off, but maybe not. For regular, normal size lint or snags I found this to be pretty worthless."
1,lint and peels,Thought this product being so large would remove peels from my sweaters twice as fast. It does not work at all. The small ones take longer but at least they work. The seller did mail this out fast and boxed well. I would not take it out on future orders from them.
1,POOR,very poor for the money!!! the lint container wont stay on and it does not work :( DONT BUYJumbo Super Lint Buster Fabric Shaver
4,A fantastic documentary,"I collect submarine movies and have all of the top-tier, as well as a lot of lesser-known sub movies. This movie taught me some history I had no clue about. Well done and very informative. It's a must-have for any serious submarine or WWII history buff."
5,"A Challenge indeed, but one worth conquering","At a glance this DVD can seem a bit overwhelming, but with a bit of practice and patience you will be amazed at how much you will learn, conquer and soon will be able to do with ease."
4,"Good DVD, awesome dancer.","Rachel Brice is one of my favourite belly-dancers and this DVD is a good example of how good she is. Everything is well explained, yoga skills are very helpful not only for ""serpentine"" style, also for belly dance in general and, as always, she is gorgeous. I don't give 5 stars 'cause I think the video quality could be improved, but the rest is perfect."
5,A worthy challenge,"I am an experienced belly dancer and I tend to burn through instructional videos, feeling they are somewhat incomplete for what I would like to learn from the instructor. Rachel Brice did a great job with this lesson.Its challenging for me, It will keep me busy for a long while. I especially like her lecture on backward bending, and the yoga specific to belly dance activities. The way I see it, self care and self respect of the mind body and soul are part of Belly dance, so yoga training is essential to this. It may be somewhat complicated for some people, but the beauty of a DVD is you can keep watching and rewinding until you understand the techniques and character of Rachel's unique style."
5,My favorite belly dance DVD,"I'm still a beginner but I practice to several belly dance videos per week. I absolutely love this DVD, even if much of it (most of the second disc) is too advanced. I nearly always open and close my workouts with her yoga sessions even if I don't do her drills and switch to another BD disc. The instructor is pleasant and the moves are clearly explained for beginners. I do my best to keep up with this fun yet challenging workout. Even if the workout/drills may be too difficult for some I would recommend the yoga sessions to any belly dancer, beginner or advanced."
5,love love love!,"I have bellydanced on and off for years. There are a blue million basic and beginner bellydance dvds out there. I had started w/ the dvds by Veena and Neena, which was a great way to learn the very basics and get in shape. I loved Sensual Bellydance w/Blanca too. But searching for something a little more advanced, I got this. WOW! There is so much material on here. I love all the specific dance moves she teaches. I just rewind and go over and over until I have a move mastered. Very easy to follow, challenging and fun. I have done yoga alot too, and the yoga in this dvd is challenging but doable, I feel GREAT afterwards. I just had my second child and still carrying the baby pooch and feel like I've lost my stomach muscles, but I can actually feel and see them coming back, praise the Lord, with the help of this dvd. Can't wait to have the dances down so I can put them to my own music. Great value!"
2,Why read about someone so self obsessed?,"We beg that you disregard ALL the other reviews on this book. CLEARLY these 'people' are dillusional, as they cannot see past Gwen Bistrow's pathetic attempt at a novel.By definition CELIA GARTH = selfish, vain, overly confident, flirty, horrible morals (a bad example for any wholesome girl).If you want to keep your daughter safe, we highly recommend that you stay AWAY from CELIA GARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nice Fryer - Bad Thermostat,"I like the fryer, especially for the price. I had the same thermostat problem mentioned by others. Setting it for 375 got about 350. I returned it as defective, but unfurtunately the replacement has the same problem. I use it mainly for fish, for which 350 is fine; I just recalibrated the markings on the thermostat so I can tell how hot it will be. Overall, its a good product with a fairly serious quality control problem."
2,Lasted under a year,This deep fryer was pretty good until last night when it died. It didn't even make it a year. It wasn't as easy to clean as they described by any means. I won't be buying this brand again.
2,Designed by a Lawyer,"This unit fries food OK although you can't overload it with too many frozen items or the oil temperature goes down quickly. In addition, I had to max out the temperature control to get the oil hot enough. But the real deal breaker for me is the extremely short wall cable with a magnetic connector that attaches to the device. The connector is meant to come loose when someone tugs on it. However, mine came loose every time we opened the top of the unit or everytime we loaded items in the basket. I'm sure their lawyers didn't want someone to sue them for damages if the thing turned over by pulling on the cord but, this is a little over kill. The cord is about two feet long and they state that you should not use an extension cord with it, so make sure you're near an outlet."
3,Ice crusher ok. blender great,I love my braun hand blender. I use it for everything. This attachment is great for chopping large quantities of food. The ice crusher only does an ok job; don't buy it for that.
1,not a good deal,Power consumption bad; info about AC converter/ adapter not available; controls confusing; and not worth the money especially with shipping added to price
4,Pure Britney,"I wasn't really a fan of bubble gum pop songs like baby one more time or oops i did it again. the songs of britney that really dragged me to her were Slave 4 You, Toxic, Everytime, Me Against the music, and outrageous. This one however, is a well blend of both pop and hip-hop. Some parts of this song can get to you, but this is definitely a great song. I would not give it a five but a 4.3....."
1,Her worst song to date!,"OMG! Can she get any worse? This song is beyond stupid & her vocals don't even sound like her, it sounds like a computer! The video is cheesy & low budget. She's rolling around in her underwear, wow, how original of her! This girl has no talent and no brains. It's no wonder her Greatest hits tanked!"
3,Good - but a little disappointing,"This book is filled with good examples from the two authors' personal lives of courageous choices they have made and the outcomes of those choices. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the book. It somehow feels rushed and seems to lack depth."
1,Marxist,"If your highest value is no war, if that value trumps liberty and all else, you might agree with this book. In it, Mills states as matter of factly that the Russians are out pacing the west in production and technology. His assessment was that the west, more specifically the United States was acting in a way to cause world war three when the USSR wanted nothing but peace. According to Mills the USSR was just reacting to the American aggression. He remarks that if one is to state this fact you are considered unpatriotic. He states that the military build up is because the military industrial complex was benefiting and that our leaders are lazy and ignorant so it keeps going. He questions the morals of the leaders, in the march to war he believes they think they have a good moral code but Mills begs to differ. This book is diatribe against America and a cheerleading squad for dictators. Amazingly similar to those currently protesting the war in Iraq, It was just written four decades ago."
5,Excellent Navigation Map,"Instructions for one of the most difficult courses in time; LIFE. This book has helped me tremendously. Quilting A Life is a handbook for understanding your current position, choosing your destination and navigating from point A to point B. It's an excellent read!"
5,Loved this series,"I loved these books as a boy, and I still enjoy them now. Yes, the science is a bit dated in a few places, and yes a few of the stories don't stand the test of time quite as well as others. However, the fact remains that these books mix fun, curiosity and scientific exploration in a way that is still very appealing. Get these books for your kids and for yourself!"
5,My favorite books from my youth!,"The 3 published Mad Scientists books are my most favorite books from my youth. I read each several times. Since becoming a father and wanting to share these outstanding stories with my kids, I searched high & low for these books. I finally stumbled upon the newly re-issued Mad Scientist Club book from Purple House Press while browsing the Tattered Cover book store in Denver.To answer the below question from Scott who asked about a movie version of the books--the Wonderful World of Disney, a Sunday night series, did a TV version of the Strange Sea Monster of Stawberry Lake. I belive the Disney version was called the Monster of Strawberry Cove."
1,don't spend the money,"There's never been a Baby Einstein video I didn't love...until this one. The puppets are awful and the show moves so slowly my baby wouldn't watch it for one minute. I can't understand what happened to a company that used to make the ONLY videos that my baby would watch. Buy the others, but don't buy this one. You'll be wasting your money."
1,Poor quality and too many toys -- UGH!,"I don't know why I keep buying Baby Einstein tapes for my kids, but I keep thinking that maybe Disney will up the quality or educational content or something. Wrong! This tape is full of the same basement production quality, annoying music box music and too many toys. I consider myself a fairly bright individual and I can't fathom how watching toys onscreen is beneficial for young children. We watched this once, and we won't watch it again."
3,Not as great as Baby Newton,My 13 month old loves her Baby Newton video (from the Volume I four-pack) so I asked her grandma to get her Baby Galileo for her first birthday. Something in this one disappoints. It seems more Disney-ized than the others. I have tried to watch it a few times but always pop it out and go back to the old stand-bys.
1,Doesnt work on all dvd players,I think the one we got is a bootleg verison bc it wont play on my dvd player that all the other ones DO play on and it looks different too. We havent gotten a chance to see the actual dvd so i cant rate how it is. Sorry
2,Languages options not respected! Disapointing!,"I live in a french speaking country, and I bought this DVD because usually Baby Einstein DVDs have langagues options. In Baby Galileo, on the pocket, it's written ""Language tracsks (Spanish,French and English)"" But when you play the DVD, on the menu, you don't even have the section ""languages"" in order to chose the language you want... I was disapointed... But the DVD doesn't seem that bad... There's a lot of things to learn about the sky... It's sad that my son cannot understand it..."
5,Stellar images and soothing music,"I got this title in an audience gift bag at a taping of The View. All three of my children are fans of the Baby Einstein series, so I was excited to take this newest title home. This one lives up to the others (although Baby Van Gogh is still our favorite). The basic theme is the sky, the sun, the stars and the planets. My 4 year old has pretty much outgrown the Einstein videos but he watches this one, along with his younger twin sisters. He likes learning the names of all the planets. Great music too."
1,Really Disappointed,"This video is definitely not up to par when compared to the rest of the Baby Einstein series. I was so excited to get the new video and after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. It feels very ""Disneyfied"". There are no real puppets anymore...just animated ones. The music is just re-used from other videos. All in all, it didn't really hold his attention for more than about 10 minutes. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,They're getting worse!,"We own all of the Baby Einstein DVD's and the one's made before the Disney buy out were far better than those made after. This one was the worst so far, my 18 mo. old doesn't even like it. They do talk about the planets and name them. But what do bubbles have to do with planets? The music was good (even though their were a few Disney songs thrown in) but overall the movie was dull and pointless."
5,Very good read!,"According to this book,a 1935 hurricane sandblasted victims into particles in Florida.However, this sounds like an urban legend repeated one too many times. I assume the people were dead already, a long time, and rotting on beach. But I wonder if the ""fact"" is really true, or just another hurrican alley urban legend? Sounds fishy to me."
2,Partisan cheerleading: inconsistent with the series,"Working my way through the Character Above All series has been a pleasant and often enlightening experience. However that was not the case with the lecture on Ronald Reagan. Peggy Noonan, who worked with the president, made no attempt to sound objective. For most of her talk Ms. Noonan alternates between defensiveness and partisan pining for her glory days gone by. The rest of the series is quite excellent and features some of today's towering figures of presidential biography. Doris Kearns Goodwin talks about FDR. David McCollough tells stories from his award winning book on Truman. Robert Dalleck rescues LBJ from being totally obscured by Vietnam. Even George Bush gets a fair hearing from Michael Beschloss. But Ronald Reagan gets a cheerleader. Ms. Noonan's partisanship seems grossly out of place among these historians. Reagan deserved better."
4,Great Read & Funny,"I don't know what all the fuss what about. In no way did Boomer tarnish the Yankees image. I think it was tarnished long before he even got there. Anyway, this is a great book. Plenty of good stories to get you chuckling. David's first adventure at hunting with Kirk Gibson is a riot. It still makes me chuckle. It's nice to see the ""other side"" of David and life on the road. Wish more baseball books were like this. Definitely no fluff in here. David shoots right from the hip."
2,Diasappointing,"I expected more from this one. The acting was poor and the music left little to be desired. Overall, I hope that they do a better job next time."
1,"Find another book, Print small, Content poor","I am very disappointed in this book.The print is too small and the content is not to the point. (Too much fluff, empty words)I am an engineer and know a good technical manual, this is not it. Find another."
5,Owls well,These books are really good and very entertaining for a mystery reader and they always add quite a bit of humor one cannot avoid laughing over. I thoroughly enjoy them for sure!
2,Nothing for your money,"Some 30 seconds tracks, and a poor information in the book. you can find more for free on the internet.I do not recommend this book."
2,Not the greatest of quality,I bought these for my 2nd grader at the begining of the school year and within 6 weeks he had a huge hole in the toe area. I thought Pony would be better quality. Maybe it is my son being too rough on his shoes? My 5 year old has the same shoe and his aren't as bad.
2,Don't know if it worked but it helped my dog who had leg cancer.,it was ok...i was desperate for my dog so it helped me psychologically giving him this.
5,Single or married- buy this book!!,"This book ""tells it like it is"". Although the contemporary state of marriage reflects a sad 50% divorce rate, the observations and suggestions in this book might help to reverse those dismal statistics.One needs to be absolutely aware and ""conscious"" before entering the holy state of marriage. Questions to ask yourself: Are you and your loved one ""best friends""? Do you have common values and interests? Do both of you consider your _commitment to your marriage_ as the most important aspect of your mutual values? Are you willing to compromise with your partner? Have you discussed parentage? (having children places the greatest strain on a marriage.)This is a fine publication, and worth your while."
1,Really poor,"Lasted all of four days before it went in the garbage! Very cheaply made. Blade would not punch through most cans. When it did, moved at a snail's pace. Going to buy another Krups handheld. My first one lasted five years."
2,See another type here.....buy it!,The one I discarded was broken but was faster. easier to use and now they are both gone!
1,Hate it,"This can opener is so horrible, I started using my manual one until I find a suitable electric."
4,"clean, straightforward, and easygoing","I used this textbook in a high-school biology course more than twenty years ago. Since that time, I have often wanted a simple, clear explanation of this biological process or that one, without foraying into overly complicated diagrams or extraneous biochemical details. Kraus's book satisfies that niche. While the explanations and pictures wouldn't win him a Ph.D., the book brims with handy, useful, and straightforward explanations. I can browse them and say, ""Oh, yeah, I remember that."" It's an easy read and it has just the information you want. It's delightful to see that I can still find useful in 2001 what I aced through in 1975!"
4,It's worth the cash,This cd is an excellent one and will be sure to impress if you enjoy the deftones other sounds. No real risk is taken on this cd and quite honestly i feel that its a good thing that deftones are sticking to their guns... an excellent buy.
1,Caveat emptor!,This DVD is nothing but a direct reproduction of the decrepit 35mm film. No attempt has been made at restoration; the sound track is exceptionally poor; the subtitles almost unreadable at times.Don't be suckered in. Wait for a better distributor of this magnificent film.
3,Russian Film,"Very dark and brooding. I liked ""Alexander Nevsky"" much better. It had a sense of humor that the Ivans did not. Interesting costumes.One has to wonder that the Europeans being such inept fops, why did Ivan work so hard to make Russia more like their countries, hmmm? Contradictions in propaganda films can be fun."
1,Oh...my ears!,"A new type of acoustic torture. Only the lyrics are interesting, other than that, I would say that this is the opposite of music."
2,2 for originality,"I was disappointed when I received this CD. Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two.By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes. Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible. If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why.I know this is ""lo-fi"", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all. As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own.I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop. If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere."
1,oh,cocorosie sucks.They can't sing.And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song.
1,Buyer BEWARE!!!,"What this description fails to mention is that the set is very very small. The box is 19 by 11 by 3 inches. The chips are not full sized chips. In fact, they're about the size of nickles. The dice are not normal sized dice. The blackjack table is useless because you can barely fit three hands on it. The quality of the wood is poor. Mine came with nicks and dents on it. The vendor should have listed its dimensions."
4,Fun movie,"This wasn't quite a Matrix, or Inception, but it was great nonetheless. I'd recommend this for anyone. The storyline is interesting, the dialogue isn't too predictable, the ending isn't mind blowing, but I enjoyed the whole ride."
4,Had me but lost me...,"*Spoiler*The main part of this movie is gripping and well done, but the tag on happy ending? Puhleeze...There are so many things wrong with that plot 'twist' that I don't know where to begin. How about the fact that some poor teacher had his body taken over because he died but, wait a minute, really he didn't. So what happened to him? Oh well, up until then I was enjoying it. The supporting cast were great, the interactions realistic, and the suspense believable."
4,Surreal,"This movie was very suspenseful and mind blowing. Can't come in the middle of it or you will be lost. Enjoyed the ending, expected it, but was pleasingly surprised."
3,"It's interesting, but a forgettable propaganda-ish film.","Movie itself has an interesting, although completely unrealistic concept behind the guy sort of time traveling. Not realistic, but standard science fiction stuff. Also watch the government propaganda within the film concerning terrorist and who is shown as one. Military surveillance of citizens shown as a good thing. CNN advertisement as credible news source. Pure propaganda and advertisement."
2,"Boring, Extremely Unrealistic -","The movie is a science-fiction plot centered on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up on a commuter train to Chicago after last aware of being in Afghanistan. His identity has changed to Sean Fentress, a school teacher. After a brief stop, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens finds himself in an experimental device that allows users to undergo the last eight minutes of their lives within an alternative timeline, and requested to discover the location of the bomb on the train and identify who set it off. Supposedly this train blast is a precursor to a larger dirty nuclear device that will be detonated in downtown Chicago. It's just too complicated, too unrealistic, and too long."
5,Loved it,"Totally held our attention fine acting and clever story telling. It's one of those 'Go back in time and change the future' stories, and quite well done."
2,Not Hot,I got one of these to use in a hotel room without a stove or microwave. But I didn't like it. It didn't heat the water hot enough. It was never quite hot enough for the tea to properly brew--just lukewarm.
1,Worked great for 2 months,"Worked great for 2 months, then the auto shut off quit working. Put water on to boil, answered a phone call, when I was done all the water was mostly boiled away. Tried several times after that and the auto shut off never worked again.I only paid a little over $20 so I'm not sure if I'm going to bother contacting the manufacturer (Amazon's suggestion) because shipping charges alone would probably be close to the cost of a new one."
4,I like it!,This is the 2nd one I have owned. If I had an expensive built in water heater I wouldn't need this but I don't. This is the fastest easiest way to get hot water quickly. I feel comfortable having my 8 year old use it.
4,As a replacement,"I bought this for my Mother to replace an older model which had built up calcium deposits and leaked badly. It works fine, just as well as the older model. But my Mother is nearly blind and pretty feeble. The new location for the ""On"" switch is a little harder for her to find and it is pretty stiff. She has a difficult time depressing the button to turn it on. The ridges help her locate it, but the location of the appliance on her counter requires her to reach an arm's length so when she depresses the button her finger rests on the ridge around the button and makes it difficult to depress it far enough to turn it on. The older split lip switch was much easier to work for her."
5,Super cute!,"Love the material, not too thick nor too thin. Comfy and warm during these ""cold"" California winters. I would definitely buy more, and the price is not too shabby!"
4,3 Short Stories About Friends,"Dorothy & Mikey are two friends who play, argue, make up and have fun together. The book contains 3 short stories about playing together & how girls don't always have to be the princess-in-distress, bragging, and keeping secrets from each other. The stories have happy endings with the friends settling their differences. The illustrations are cute. The stories interested my 3 1/2 yr old daughter alot as immediately following reading the book she wanted to act out the stories and play dorothy & mikey."
4,Not what the picture shows,What came is not what the picture shows. Instead you get an ignition tester that functions the same but looks quite different. If for some reason it matters exactly what you get don't buy this one. However the product that was sent did work exactly as this one would. And for what it's worth this is a very good product.
2,Gross,Bought this item about six months ago and have eaten 3 bars since. They taste gross and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
4,Easy to use can opener,"While I am not as thrilled as some people who reviewed this product, I do have to say that once I got the hang of it, it is easy to use. It is sharp and cuts the can lid so that there are no jagged edges nor are there places where the can lid is not cut (this was happening with my other one). Although the magnet is supposed to hold the lid and pull it off of the can for easier disposal, I find that it is not strong enough to held the can lids. However, with the clean cutting of the can lid, I really do not thing this poses a problem. It is easy to turn the handle to cut the can. It is light weight but is substantial enough to feel that you have a tool that will do the job it was designed for. Overall, I am happy with it. I have had both manual can openers and also electric ones, and I always go back to the manual ones. They work, they are easy to clean, and they fit in the utility drawer. I think it is well worth the money and hope to be using it for years to come."
1,Rip-off,"Colin Garrett has written only one book ""The World Encyclopedia of Locomotives"" and it has been endlessly repackaged along with ""Great Railway Journeys of the world"" by Max Wade-Matthews. So far I have purchased 6 different books that are combinations of one or both of these titles."
5,Product worked great.,Wasnt sure if this was the correct opener to my unit but it was and it works great. Shipping was on time and the product was just as it stated. Thanks
5,Great Fun!,"I loved this book! I bought it for my son and daughter-in-law who were expecting. We had a great time looking up names they liked, as well as our own names. Not every name in the world is listed, but that's not the point. It tells how a name is perceived by people, and that is extremely helpful. I was very relieved when they looked up Zeke, which they were considering, and found ""dirty, smelly, hillbilly""!"
2,It rusts!,"This *was* a great can opener, until yesterday. When I tried to use it yesterday, it wouldn't work. I discovered that the little metal ""chrome"" post which provides contact with the blade portion of the opener was completely rusted. I can only assume it provided some kind of switch or trigger to turn on the motor, but with all the rust, it couldn't make the connection. I had originally bought this opener to replace an old one from the 70's, which had just died. So, the old one lasted 30 years and this one lasted 1. Not a good track record."
4,Exactly what I needed.,"It is hard to find a can opener with a knife sharpener in stores anymore, and the Sunbeam is one of the best. It is fairly quiet, works reliably, and the whetstones work perfectly."
4,can opener just ok,"Sunbeam 3108 Adjustable Can Opener with Knife Sharpener, WhiteTHOUGHT THIS WOULD BE EASY TO USE. I RECEIVED IT AND TRIED OPENING A CAN.COULDN'T SEEM TO GET THE CAN TO CATCH THE BLADE OF CAN OPENER. I RAISED THE CAN OPENER HIGHER, AND IT FINALLY CAUGHT. HOPE I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FUTURE PROBLEMS. IN THE PAST, CAN OPENERS I'VE OWNED HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER TO USE"
3,Prelief,I really cannot determine how much the product may be helping relieve bladder inflammation for me. It is worth trying.
4,good product,I use it to help with interstitial cystitis. It helps to cut down on the acid that is in my system. It is a good product
3,Nice production but hard to follow,"This is a very-well produced video on stretching and the music is excellent. Most of the moves are not difficult, but the main routines are continuous flow from one position to another. Despite an introduction to each routine where Smith shows each of the moves she will be making, when she gets into the actual program she moves rapidly to the music and the positions are hard to follow. One can't watch the video and do the positions, as a lot of them require looking somewhere else to execute properly. I've done this program about 10 times so far, as it is a good balanced workout for posture, flexibility and building core strength, but I still am not in synch with her movements."
3,Good.,Fine Ann Smith CD. Not as good as the original Stretching For Seniors in my opinion. However still a good one.
4,Creepy!,As soon as it comes on you get a BRUTAL scene which kinda sticks with you I wish more directors were that bold. The movie it self is decent with lots of scares better than most. Its low budget but the movie is interesting enough that you wont notice. If it had more money attached i wouldnt mind a theatrical wide release.
5,WW,"A fun, easy to use camera. Docking station might be useful but I had no problem hooking this up straight to my computer's USB port (Windows XP). You can pay a little less and get a lot less camera. Picture quality with 2MP is very good on a PC, and we got nice 4"" X 6"" prints after uploading to an on-line printing source."
1,Kodak Easyshare CX6200,"I bought this camera about 2 months ago n i guess i did some good filming with it and what not, but it takes huge pictures. it started off taking like 24 kb pictures and now it takes 1-2 mbs. Now screen cracked on me and that will probably cost more to replace then the camera itself. i dont really like this camera."
2,Died 3 days later....,"Took some great Christmas pictures, great zoom and clarity but the whole thing broke before New years 2004! I didn't drop it or anything... even put new batteries... so its off to the manufacturer... be careful with this one!"
4,nice,"boughtthis cam for my girl,works fine i guess... no bells no whistles, but 2 be real this take great pics for 2 mega pixels"
3,Don't buy if it's going to be used for an adult,"Its amazingly simple, but image quality is worse than the old time mavicas. So buy it for your kids, and save for something like Casio Exilim or Nikon over 4 MP."
1,Not worth the money at any price,I purchased this to replace a worn out bean grinder that I had for well over 5 years.This unit is very loud for it's size.I have used much larger commercial units that make less noise.The lid is to small to hold grinds for a full pot of coffee and seems to constantly develop static resulting in the coffee grounds sticking to the lid.The blades are elevated approximately 1/2 inch from the bottom of the grind chamber causing the coffee grounds to become packed under the blade assembly requiring that you dislodge them from the unit.
5,Toast master 1119 grinder,"This grinder works quite well for my flax seed, rye seed, hulled barley & others. Quite affordable too. Definitely a good buy for the money."
2,It didn't last,This grinder laster about 5 months. I would be happy to spend more money for a machine that would last longer.
3,"It does the job, price was right","I do not get a consistent grind, but it does the job. For the price, I don't regret the purchase, but I also wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others."
4,Simple but works quite well.,Simple but works quite well. There is no ability to change the grind setting and you need to hold down the button but if you want a more course grind just don't grind it as long. It is a very simple design and can grind a fair amount of coffee. Everyone with an espresso maker needs one.
5,"Easy to use grinder, still running like a CHAMP!","I had this grinder since 2006, it is almost 2011 and I want everyone to know that it is still running like the first day I bought it, I use it strictly for my coffee beans at the office. It is used 3-4 times a day, 5 days a week and it is in perfect condition. So easy to use. Toastmaster you have made a great and long lasting product, I hope that it will continue to last in the years to come. Highly recommended if you are looking for as simple a coffee grinder as you can possibly find and use."
3,Wait until,This one comes out on Fat City or some other cheaper engine! This is mediocre at best. His production is nice but the talent he used(or should I say lack thereof) are mostly TONE DEAF! I was so disappointed since I paid the import price for this CD 38.99+tax. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it. It reminds me of Michael Johnson's The Servant Master..good effort if the vocals were muted.
2,Good while it lasted,"This burner died after less than a month of (admittedly heavy) use. It worked fine one morning and later that day when I tried to turn it on, nothing happened.It was great when it was working, though."
3,Not his best book,"I am a big fan of some of his other books. I love horror and I love distrubing!!!! But this one, the ending completely ruined it for me, it seemed to me it was more of way to just end the book and not the story. Like I said enjoyed the book up to the end and I was left with a very strong dislike at that point. I would say not one of his best works, I would read his other works like grimm memeriols and grim reapings for his better works."
2,Just not interesting,This is the 2nd Patrick Gates book I've read and I'm beginning to think I'm just not a fan of his writing. The Prison had a couple of chilling parts to it but otherwise was bland and boring.
2,Not as good as his others.,"I bought it because I liked his other book (Grim Offering), but this one was not as good. Too predictable and not very exciting."
3,Shiva Rea Lunar Fow Yoga,This was first time I bought her DVD. I liked that there were not only asana but breathing the practices with each lesson. However there were some asanaa which were too diffculut for me. ( I have been practice Yoga for 4 years)
2,A weak attempt at critique...,"This book attempts to determine the areas in which Schoenberg 'erred' in the creation of his twelve-tone idea. This book deals less with solid theory but more with the ideals of aesthetics, perception, philosophy, and basically many unfounded claims. This book assaults Schoenberg's musical achievments, with very little assesment of his value at all. It seems that this book is has is seeking to dismantle the strong history of modern music, by claiming that one of it's father's was in error."
5,the best wedding book on the market,"This book is by far the best money any bride will spend on her wedding! It gives tips on everything, from how to pick a dress to how to make sure you don't get ripped off. It even gives tips on the best bridal websites! I carry this book everywhere with me. It has been a lifesaver in the planning of my wedding!!"
1,This book has no style.,"As a new bride, I thought this book was --well--let's say---BORING!. No style..no design and these authors are ""lost"" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. If you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. If you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. Also-warning ..these authors have TERRIBLE reviews on their Baby Bargains book. It seems they write all their own great reviews. I think Martha Stewart weddings is OBVIOUSLY much better and I also think I would not recommend a book from Denise and Alan Field's EVER."
4,Helpful tool!,This book was very helpful! I loved that it was broken down into different categories and it had a lot of great websites included!
2,Do it yourself,It didn't really help to plan a wedding unless you plan on cooking the food and doing everything yourself.
5,Excellent,Love watching the classic Alfred Hitchcock movies. These are my favorites. Enjoyed all five of them. Will watch them over and over again. Excellent and highly recommend.
2,Not what I wanted.,My husband ordered this book when we decided to put my son on a gluten-free diet. I was looking mainly for a gluten-free cookbook with some helpful hints included. Half the book is about the author's story and theories about why the diets in this book should be followed. For the most part I don't agree with her theories. The cookbook part is okay but so far has not really been the taste of my family. Also there are a lot of recipes for muffins and desserts which I don't really need because stores have a lot of gluten-free snacks. I am really looking for more meals I can cook my family.
2,Sort the cards before you waste valuable time!,"These cards include items not covered on the GMAT. My advice is to sort through the cards and throw away the ones that don't apply. It seems like they just took the SAT cards and put them in a new box. While some concepts apply in both cases, others (such as vocabulary) are not the focus of the GMAT. Don't use this as your only guide to studying for the GMAT."
5,San (flippin') Quentin,"This set rules. The DVD is alright, but the extra tracks on the Cd's are worth twice the price. Johnny Cash at his best. As wellas The Carter Family (2nd gen), the Statler Brothers, and Carl Perkins. Also a well designed box and guide. Exquisite."
3,A frustrating watch,"First of all, the concert footage and music is great. That's what I bought the DVD for and I'm not disappointed.However, the show cuts back and forth from the concert to interviews with guards and prisoners. Unfortunately, the sound quality of these interviews is TERRIBLE. Even struggling to listen, I could only make out a portion of what they were saying. I wish the DVD manufacturer had somehow enhanced the sound or at least provided subtitles. It's very frustrating to ""almost"" be able to tell what someone is saying.You could skip forward past the interviews (and you probably will have to) but they are so intermixed with the music that you'll have to watch this DVD with remote in hand the entire time."
2,Low power battery,"While the description does not discuss this, the picture of the item shows that this is a 600 mAh battery. The OEM equipment is a 1000 mAh battery meaning that this battery will not last as long on a single charge."
3,TM practitioner exposes the BS underlying it all,"Well I bought this book used for three dollars and it was worth every penny.In the very beginning inside the cover it states that Paul Mason has practiced TM for over twenty years yet throughout the book he seems negative about his own Guru.Perhaps he is being truthful(the reason I gave three stars) but he does not mention the benefits of TM for himself REALLY so is he trapped in a mere habit of doing TM everyday? Also he fails to mention that capitalistic Westerners are running the TM movement for the elderly Guru and with or without his permission are ripping people off for ungodly sums of money for mere words. It costs $2,500.00 to learn TM and $3000.00 to learn to hop around in the lotus position for the Sidhi techniques.He goes farther to disprove and discredit TM than a lot of anti-TM authors....thanks Paul for telling people what a line of BS TM really is. :) Save your money and look elsewhere...."
3,was ok until it BROKE!!!!,"This was the third or fourth year of using this, and up till now had workded ok. Cake mixes and light things ok, but cookie doughs with the dough hooks really strain this mixer. I had recently taken it apart and cleaned and oiled the motor, only to have one of the beater shafts break off from the forged motor mount. Mmmmh, looks like its a goner!!!!!!! JB Weld anybody!! LOL"
1,"Fast, faster, or even faster...","This mixer has many speed settings, but they all pretty much go the same speed. The ""low"" setting is so fast that if you are mixing much liquid it spashes all over. I would not recommend this mixer, spend a few more dollars and get a better one!!!"
2,Engine burnt out within less than a year,"I think this is fine for the price you pay. I used mine quite a bit (maybe once every week or two), and the engine burnt out on it within less than a year. I was making my own frosting with it, so beating pretty thick mixtures and that may have been the problem. I will go for a better quality set this time."
4,An African Woman's viewpoint,"Do you know what I likemost about the introduction? It's when you spoke aboutthe police officer you and your colleuge met afterwork when you were doing some search on your own andthis police guy took your driving documents and he wasdoing his job and you were trying to bribe him to getaway as your friend advice you to,despair his littlesalary he makes he refuse to take what you offer andhe little give you your driver lince and otherpaper,what intresting is if he has taken the bribe youknow you wouldn't talk about it,it's just somethingyou will never talk adout in a book like that,if youdo you are destroying the country's army."
2,Fragments of timelessness,"2 1/2If Jefferson Airplane styled psych-rock is your thing than this might interest you, as a decent amount of elements persevere whilst the rest fell away."
3,Entertaining,"Lots of profanity and sex, but a fast-paced read. Better than the movie - premium rush! I'd recommend it, with some forewarning."
4,I couldn't put the book down.,"I finished this book in two days it was so good. Definately a fast paced, action packed cyberthriller for the 90's. I loved the mention of recent events and 90's music and tv programs. Chet's narrow escapes amaze me. An excellent first book for Joe Quirk. I can't wait until his next book is published."
2,Boring,"I barely finished this book, and I was extremely disappointed. I was looking forward to reading the novel, as I'm a huge fan of the TV show Sex in the City, and I'm a fan of the ""20/30 something female looking for love"" genre. But this book fell flat. Some of the events were mildly amusing, but not funny enough to warrant the length of the book. The foul language seemed [unreal] -- as though it was there more to shock the reader than anything. The sex scenes were boring. And, worst of all, there was no character development at all. Even some of the flimiest novels I've read paid some attention to giving the characters a bit of depth. The Ariel was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I've ever read about. I None of her relationships rang true. I just didn't care what happened to her. I really wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone."
2,Disappointing Easy Read,"I bought this book in hopes that it would live up to Bridget Jones, but it didn't. I thought Ariel Steiner was extremely unlikable. She was cheap, annoying, and repellant. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, don't waste your time."
2,hard to care...,"Basically, this is the story of 22 year old Ariel, and how she tries to make it in the big city after graduating from college. She ends up temping while writing a ""trials and tribulations"" (read ""sex"") column in a local paper. A premise that could have been funny ends up being slightly boring. Ariel tries to appear as a bad girl, using phrases like ""he ground my beef"", but ends up having to make up the dirtiest parts of her column. And then, when she gets notoriety, the way she wanted, she whines about it. I just couldn't really care about the character of Ariel at all.For a more entertaining, and less graphic, story about trying to make it in the big city and failed hopes, try reading ""In the Drink"" by Christiansen. As for this being ""the thinking person's Bridget Jones"" (yes, it says that on the back cover), I beg to disagree. These are very different books. Bridget is purely trying to entertain. Don't ask me what Ariel is trying to do, but she certainly didn't manage to entertain."
1,Ariel Steiner makes Ignatius J. Reilly look like a gentleman,"I've seen Amy Sohn on TV a few times and decided to check out this novel at B&N. I finished about half of it, just out of sheer curiosity and obviously didn't purchase it. It's amusing if only because of what poorly written, self-important, right out of the gutter sewer sludge it is. The protaganist is self-absorbed, humorless and unlikeable. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be satirical or some kind of ironic twist on this sort of coming-of-age-20-something-hip-post-feminist genre, but I'm afraid it's not because I think the author expects us to actually RELATE to the main character and take her seriously."
3,Mark is always worth watching,"If you have never seen a Movie with Mark Dascascos in it, this is a good starter. His acting only gets better with every movie he makes. While ""Only the Strong"" and ""Kickboxer 5"" are top notch in showing his martial art ability, ""Drive"" shows a more seasoned actor capable of just about anything he sets his mind to. Really, a must see."
5,Great cd!,"This is such a great cd. I went out and got the very last copy of the limited edition cd this morning. Its worth every cent. The cd is enhanced so its got a really spiffy program with pics, movies, and even a game. Its also got a song on there called Boy's Republic which you cannot find on the regular cd, and it is an amazing song! There are only 50,000 of this cd out there...most of them are probably already gone, so if you're a deftones fan..i suggest you get this while its still here!"
4,A journey,"This is a good collection of Gary Burton's work (so far)and contains some very interesting choices (all made by Burton himself).Burton's chosen instruments(Vibes and later on some Marimba) are difficult to be really expressive on but he suceeds almost effortlessly.While Burton is not a composer himself he takes us on a journey with him to find his music through other writers that is equal parts fascinating ,frustrating and joyous.As a player he is delicate and linear rather than wild and free and his choice of music and musicians reflects this.His playing at his best is exquisite and will certainly have you returning to this disc."
3,Basic,"It is a no nonsense simple, basic set of colors that was a start for someone wanting to try out water colors. Not much in the small tubes, but at least a start."
3,Warped Box....,I had my mother buy this set for my daughter's summer art class. Seems like a nice set if I can get the box open. The wood is warped and the locks are virtually impossible to open. I finally got it open with with a butter knife. I noticed the box is pretty much wood glued together and one of the sides corners is coming apart. It is cheap! Now everything inside seems pretty good. We will see when she starts her class. If I had time to return this product I would but I can't so I am going to try to get something to tie around the box. So she can use it. Class starts 4 days from now.... ugh!
1,Dismal rather than Cataclysmal.,"Boulez is'nt cold, really, he's just detached; and there's nothing wrong with detachment, if you're an amputee. The main problem with objective interpretation, of which so many of today's non-inspired seem very fond, is that it never allows the subject--or audience--to be involved. As written, Bruckner's Eight is a glorious cathedral, but here, forget about sentiment, personal transcendence, religious experience, finding the meaning to life, or an adventure to Valhalla, it's little more than a study in architecture."
2,way too small,"I bought this product several months ago for my dog and she loved it. Especially nice to take the squeaker out so it's not so annoying. However I wanted to get another one for my parents' dog but when I received this one, it was so much smaller. I know it was made for a small dog but it was like I got the extra small one. I was really disappointed."
4,Seems durable,Took my bichon about a week to destroy this. It seems well made but if your dog is a real chewer it won't last long.
5,great for small aggressive chewers,"My miniature dachshund can usually destroy a toy like this one in a couple of hours but this thing really lasts. I was worried about the Velcro closure but it seems to be really strong, she still has not managed to get the squeaker out. AND it comes with an extra squeaker which is a big plus in my book. Definitely worth the price. This toy is even better in real life and has a mix of textures for dogs to chew on. For example underneath the duck's ""wings"" is a sheepskin type of fabric. Fun."
5,Great little toy!,"I recently purchased a few of these nearly indestructible toys for our beagle and our american bulldog puppy. They play very rough with these little animals, including playing tug with them several times a day, and they are still in one piece!! I love that they don't have any stuffing in them, so there are no white fluffy pieces flying around my house after a day of play! Plus the extra squeakers that come with each animal are a huge help! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!"
2,Dead Duck,"Frankie, our eight month old twelve pound Dachshund destroyed the Kong Platy Duck in approximately forty five minutes. The small size is extra small. I do not understand the point of the additional squeaker. What does Kong expect the customer to do with a few pieces of ripped cloth and fuzz?"
2,The squeaker died after a week,"Let's face it, squeaky toys are not much fun once they stop squeaking. That's what this little duck did about a week after I purchased it."
5,An Exciting Tenor with a Wonderful Voice,"I bought this disk about a year ago. It was as if I were transported back to the time when tenors had beautiful, dramatic, exciting voices. Think of Corelli, for example. I thought that maybe this was just the disk (nevertheless, a good reason to buy it). However, I recently saw him sing the Duke in Rigoletto at the Met. The elctricity went on whenever he came on stage (unfortunately, Sumi Jo's dismal Gilda turned the elctricity right off whenever he walked off stage). I love Domingo and Pavarotti. But, Domingo does not excell in this reperatory (i.e., Rigoletto) and as Beautiful as Pavarotti sings, he is not really beliveable in the role. Alvarez' singing on this disk is every bit as exciting as his Met performances. If you think there are no great tenors on the horizon, listen to this to change your mind. I can't wait to here more from Alvarez."
2,"Loved it, for a week","I thought this was great! I was willing to give it a shot, even though the reviews weren't that good. Unfortunately, my issue was that after about a week of use, the spring in the pump did not spring back. If you pressed it, you had to manually pull it back up.I called customer service and spoked to someone, who was very helpful. After trying her suggestions (soap to water ratios, and leaving space at the top for air), I asked to return it and get a refund. She was very understanding and refunded my money quickly. I hope they come out with a new version, so I can try it out again."
4,Great product with the use of the right tools,"The product works great, as long as you have the right attachments and/or bags. Apples in the bag have stayed for over 2 weeks cut up and still taste good. Would recommend product, but know that you will need to purchase the bags separately and will need to consider that with the price."
3,Disappointing,"Design flaw - when you are listening to the tuner and you eject a cd, dvd, the tuner stopsyou get the cheapest of cheap cables to connect it to a sony tv - bought incidentally at the same time. (Sony tv has s-video connection at the side - great for camcorders but damn all use if you want to connect it to this unit permanently)speakers should be wireless for this money.Wanted to like this unit but very, very disappointed. Looks are deceiving."
5,Great!!,"A great choice of songs including ""Personal Manager"" my personal favorite Albert King solo. But the clincher for me is ""Blues Power"". This song itself is worth the price of the book and CD! It's not the song so much as there is so much of it. It can be looked at as a key to Albert's style. There are so many licks you can learn to ""jam"" Albert just by learning this song alone. Try breaking this song up anyway you want and jamming with any slow blues track you have and you'll see what I mean. This book/CD was a must for me and I highly recommend it! Wolf did a fantastic job with it! It's worth twice the price!"
3,Not as good as Eurotrash . . .,"This is an excellent CD. It's sad that Orgy seems to be the most well-known representative of this underrated genre, while a band like Zeromancer who is far superior receives so little attention. This CD is not as catchy or listenable as Eurotrash, and is a 3.5 realistically, but is still a great record and a must-have for fans of electro-tinged hard rock."
4,"Buy it for ""the Dead...""","I bought this CD for Isle of the Dead...and loved it. The symphony is good, but think of it as an extra bonus."
4,Hells Corner,"When life is war and war is life, what else do people know? Anna Politkovskaya takes the reader for a non faint of heart journey through the streets of Chechnya- a war torn republic in the North Cuscus. Maybe it was the writing style, but everything just seemed to blend together into a gray portrait of death and survival without dignity. There are no winners Chechen or Russian within the context of Politkovskaya's book. Not even officers of the Russian army as profiled in one of the last stories she tells. War spares no victims and often regenerates itself in the form of a youth who've known nothing but war, replenishing the cycle of war. It's unfortunate that Politkovskaya could not have broken up her stories a little more because though she does a good job of profiling the people of war, much of it is lost in this swirling vortex of near-ending graying death and war."
2,could be so much better,"My 19 month old is nuts about things that go, with diggers being his current fave. I bought this book with some excitement but it's been disappointing. He may grow into it, but here's why I'm underwhelmed: the text is uninspiring; the size somehow at odds with the substance; and it simply doesn't have the wow factor that _My Big Truck Book_ has been able to elicit. And, oddly, there seem to be far fewer images than we'd expect, which may explain why he always seems bored with this book. We keep this in his diaper bag, so if we're at restaurants or in the car, we dig it out for him. He always reaches for his little animal books or barn books instead. Too bad!"
4,Green recycled truck,Well constructed & recycled to boot! I bought this for my grandson and am saving it for a Christmas gift.
2,Not what I hoped for,"I ordered this because I have a few CD's that skip occasionally. Unfortunately, this device did not do what it promissed. In fact, its really much more work than its worth. First of all, the first 2 cds I tried only skipped a little bit. After putting them through this device, they skipped even more. The directions say you must really buff them with the special buffing cloth. I don't know how much buffing people are willing to do but I'm a relatively strong guy and I buffed for about 10 minutes before being exhausted. Then I tried again and was just very dissapointed. Even worse, the spinning of the handle is quite time consuming and not very much fun. It would be very nice if the thing was mechanical and automatic. I have little patience for plastic toys. The thing even gets water all over the place. All in all, a good idea I suppose, but really a dissapointing performance. I'm afraid to use it on any more CDs."
1,cheesy,"This is the cheesiest item I have ever been duped into purchasing; in retrospect, I should have known better. Extremely lightweight all-plastic construction insures a short useful life. I followed the instructions to the letter, and my CD still skips. The only positive aspect of the initial use is that one of the airweight plastic fittings broke, which means that I can throw it in the garbage where it belongs, since it's hardly worth the time and effort to return. A complete and utter waste of time, resources, and energy!"
1,Fell Apart 2,"This blender works only so so...But what disappointed me most was that, as the other reviewer mentioned, the operation button FALLS APART.It took me awhile to find the bits that fell into the food together with the button."
2,Worked fine except for the leaking oil!!!,"I used this blender 5 times to make Slim Fast Shakes then it started oozing what I assume was oil from the motor. The bottom is not sealed well and I could see where stuff could get stuck in the cracks, YUCK!! I was happy with the speed and it didn't seem all that loud to me (I had nothing to compare it to as this was my first hand blender). I don't think I will get another one, I'll just get a regular blender since this one didn't fit in any of my glasses anyway and I had to use a 4 cup measuring cup, I had to wash more dishes by using this. The shipping was great tho, no problem with Amazon but Toastmaster needs to go back to the drawing board!!!"
1,Don't Buy It!!!!,"We used this for several months until it started leaking oil mysteriously and eventually the blend spindle separated from the motor, rendering it useless."
4,Good Drama,"When I bought this movie I thought that I was about to behold one of the best fighting movies ever from all the rave reviews that I have read.But instead I got a very Dramatic intellectually challenging story line with complex subtitles that sometimes resemble a good novel.But as for fights this movie didn't pack much punch until the end although this movie does contain some very inventive and well coordinated fight scenes by no means should this movie be rated along those merits but rather for being a very well filmed,superbly acted,dramatic piece of HK cinema.Buy it for the story,very enjoyable,4 stars"
3,Useful but lacking,"I passed the business law II Dantes test, and the information here was helpful. What lacks is an explanation of the answers. There were many points where I had trouble finding consistent logic behind the answers, so some exposition would have been helpful."
5,Top of the line 3/8 air ratchet,"Purchased for Husband, who is a professional mechanic. This was a step up from his previous IR model, which lasted 5 years. He is still very impressed after several months. Although this tool has a button, the speed can still be regulated with a good hand. Power, this 3/8 air ratchet has hit. On 3/8"",8mm, or 10mm bolts, don't push the button in completely or this tool's torque will break the best grade bolt. He used to use his 3/8 air ratchet to tighten diesel exhaust clamps, but not anymore. After breaking a few clamps, he went back to the 1/4"" air ratchet."
5,A Mighty Burner,"A Mighty BurnerFrom start to finish, this book accelerates like we did at the '68 Mexico City games, and it carries a powerful political message too. Reading it is an antidote for all the mind killing words that are everywhere about HIV/AIDS in Africa and that too many African Americans believe.Lee E. EvansHead Men's and Women's Track and Cross Country Coach, University of South Alabama"
5,A model scientific biography,"With wit, grace, and a mastery of the literature, Bialy has penned what will no doubt serve as a model for future scientific biographies. It is to be hoped that his courage will also serve as a model, inspiring others to seek out and chronicle today's Galileos, the genuine scientists whose insights America's Corporate-Scientific Complex is so ruthless in suppressing. In challenging any reigning scientific dogma, the first question is always: ""How could so many smart people be so wrong?"" Both Bialy and his subject are rare examples of thinkers who can not only answer such questions but do so with exuberant and cheerful ease."
4,Love The Arrangements But One Thing,"I really think this is an awesome book to study and play David Lanz' music, and right at my level to test my sigh reading abilities. However, I just do not understand why a major music publisher cannot figure out how to make a piano book stay open. Maybe it will in time, and I am working with it."
3,Arrived broken!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,First off it arrived cracked and now every time I open it to clean and put the lid back on it chips more. The geckos love it.
5,Great humid hide!,"Despite some of the negative reviews, I decided to purchase this cave as a humid hide for my Leopard Gecko. I bought the medium size even though she is still young (3 months), so she can grow into it and it's the perfect size. I use terrarium moss inside of it and it stays pretty damp, only needing a light misting with a water bottle every few days. So far this hide seems sturdy and looks really great!UPDATE: My gecko has since used this hide for her first shed since we brought her home. She loved it and stayed in it comfortably all day. Her shed was effortless and we are VERY pleased with this hide!"
2,A light weightproduct for kightweight needs.,"I bought two sets of the sprinkler system based on earlier reviews. Like books, reviewers feel they have to post a positive review. The sprinklers are plastic and so light they don't maintain a fixed position. Water pressure variations reduce the effective coverage area. I use them on small plots fowers. I will be using drip=hoses for flower plots,and regular metal sprinklers for larger areas."
2,You'd better have GREAT water pressure.,"I bought this back when I was on community water. We had decent water pressure--enough to run any single sprinkler GREAT. But this dumps water on your lawn or garden very, very fast--note that even people on municipal water systems can have problems. So if your water pressure is always high, this will probably be great. Otherwise, find another solution."
1,Download version will not install,"I sure wanted to take advantage of a great sale price with this Amazon download version, and my computer runs dozens of games supported on XP (including the 3rd in this Runaway series), but this download would not install. Amazon support walked through it with me, confirmed that upon download the install button didn't work, and gave me the contact info for Pendulo Studios. After Pendulo ignored all requests for help -- they just don't care, I guess -- at least Amazon gave me a refund.I sure would like to start with the first game in this series, but it sounds like others have had some real issues with the DVD version as well -- so, perhaps I'll just ingore Pendulo and their products too from now on."
1,Buggy Game,This game is very nice but you will be lucky if you finish it. It is full of bugs and crashes continuously. I gave up at chapter 3.
3,"Not The Best, Not The Worst","I'll play almost any adventure game, because there aren't so many of them around. I paid $20 for this and don't regret it, but I wish it was a little more fun. There really wasn't that much humor. Some puzzles were tedious, there was a lot of trying everything with everything else for no obvious reason, and a lot of going back to the same places over and over because there is now something there that wasn't there before. If you like middling adventure games with good graphics, this will keep you entertained for a few days."
4,Great convenience and price,"At this price I bought two. The sound quality is not as good as when I play the MyFi through my home stereo or car radio, but now it is easy to have XM radio in any room. This speaker system is small and light enough that I have even taken it with me when I've traveled."
3,Speaker and mount OK but...,"As another reviewer mentioned, I received the unit and the antenna does not function (confirmed by switching it with my other antenna at home).With Amazon's return policy I decided to call Altec Lansing direct and they are sending out another antenna (about 2-3 weeks though).So I'll just use the unit in the MyXM mode until then."
2,Not loud enough!,"The top volume setting is way too quiet. I work with an oven close to me, and can barely hear the radio when it's turned up. Speakers put out a constant faint buzz also. Not very good quality!"
2,My Fi doc,I bought one of these several years ago and loved it so much I used it up. I was happy to find another one! Sound is very good and docking system is user friendly! Looking forward to many years use!! Seller was quik and fair with pricing! !
4,Sad,"This is a sad book. Shirley Wilder was smart, precocious and could have given the world so much. Why are people thrown away? This book was so unbelievably sad."
3,Skip the first 4 tracks and it's OK,"I actually think this is better than Works Vol 2 which I found completely unlistenable. It has one of the worst album titles and covers in music history (I remember how embarrassed I was back when the album came out when I took it to the counter to buy it). The first 4 songs are just terrible - could have been the Ohio Express doing those pop songs. I remember thinking this could not be ELP, and I still feel that way. But the last 3 tracks, including the long one, are not bad. They certainly are not up with early ELP standards, but make the album worthwhile to me."
1,Remastering of a lousy album - what is the point?,"Maybe if they had released under some other band's name it might have been acceptable but for an ELP album, this is as bad as it gets. Like many other ELP fans, I was bitterly disappointed with this album. ELP have so many other good albums - go listen to Trakus, Pictures, Works, Brain Salad Surgery etc. and avoid this one.Why bother remastering this album? Polishing a turd doesn't make it any less a turd."
3,"Pleasant, enjoyable music","It's worth to admit that I couldn't call myself an ELP 'fan' because I honestly don't like their music. But I like this album. It has pleasant, catchy, diverse songs and is quite melodic.The opener, ""All I want is you"" has a slight 'sea-shanty' feel to it, the the title track is my favourite and is really solid, in the vein of progressive pop, with keyboard sounds and everything, but really catchy. ""Taste of my love"" is a brooding, bluesy tune and ""the gambler"" has a predictably western feel to it. ""For you"" is an interesting ballad and ""Canario"" is a pleasant, airy instrumental.""Memoirs..."" is a bit long (even the title) for one listen but still nice and gives a lot of new sounds. Overall I enjoy this album, and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates progressive pop."
3,"I'll roam your Love Beach, Baby!","Look, this is definitely not ELP's best effort, but the boys look really hot on the cover. ""A Taste of My Love"" may be full of silly sexual innuendo, but it fueled many adolescent fantasies, believe me."
5,this is prog!,"5 reasons , 5 stars1. the cover is amazing, young guys having fun on the beach, showing some skin2. elp start to take music seriously3. profound lyrics4. greg lake's chest, i mean, come on, what a man5. essential for any REAL prog rock fan"
1,Pass the Smelling Salts ...,"... after ""Sludge Beach"" is over. Man, this smells of Atlantic influence in the worst way ... what better revenge than to destroy a great reputation? I'm sure this sold OK back in '78, but it's albums as this that gave The Sex Pistols creedence. As I'm sure the principals loathe this CD as well; one can only wonder if they dared take this out on the road ... to be run over with that tour caravan of theirs. Or tossed back to Atlantic with the greeting: ""We're done with you now, clean up YOUR mess.""It DOES sound as if they went back to their roots and played Beatley pop, ELP style - with a little RnB thrown in. Whatever the motivations behind this album, it doesn't work. One can't record an album side of derivative pop then pump the flip side of half of what the listener expected to hear in the first place.If you're new to ELP, start with their debut CD and stop at ""Works"". It worked for me and it'll work for you, too.Pass the margarita, hold the umbrella."
2,Kinda Boring...,"Too much Bablyon and bible quotes for me.....Not much historical info...More of an essay....The guy is a friar, so I guess I should have expected a lot of religion...If you want philosophical type history on New Mexico, you might like this book....If you are into mestizo and coyote commentary there is some of that too..."
5,AWESOME,"this was an awesome book. it really made me want to keep reading the series. they were all awesome too. this book is so real, and honest, and it really explores the way teens feel. i hope kerri and matt stay together, and that all the books to come are this awesome!!!!!"
5,BEST YET !!!!!,"THIS TRADE PAPER BACK COLLECTING THE FRIST SEVEN ISSUES OF THE THEN ON GOING SERIES OF THE VIGILANTE PUNISHER IS WELL..... FAN$""@""$TASIC!!!!! HAVEN JUST WRITTIN THE MEGA SELLING CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED LIMITED SERIES (WECOME BACK FRANK)GARTH ENNIS KEPT GOING WITH THIS VERY FUNNY STORY OF HOW (A) FRANK,TEAMS UP WITH SPIDEY(B) GETS BEATEN NEAR TO DEATH BY A BONIC TRANSVESTIE..

PICK THIS UP EVEN IF YOUR NOT A PUN MAN FAN ITS GREAT AND I CANT PUT ANY BETTER THEN THAT.... OH ! AND THERE IS TWO OTHER STORIES INCLUDED IN THIS, GREAT ALSO WITH ART BY MR DILLON WHO IS A PERFECT FOYLE FOR ENNIS'S WRITTING..."
1,CHEAP and CRAPPY,"I got this very excited for my 8 yr old, when I received the set, I noticed that the magnets were actually PLASTIC casings with magnets inside ... Very dissapointing. They barely stick to eachother like any other magnet would. Not worth the money AT ALL. I am throwing these out and getting real metal magnets. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT."
1,Just not helpful,"This book did NOT help me at all. It was not specific enough and did not share the the pecs pictures which they use for the training! I was better off going with my gut than trying to follow a book. A child on the spectrum has so many needs, and they are all different."
3,ok book,I found certain this that were helpful in this book but overall was looking to get more use out of it than we have. Ended up buying another item that has been more helpful.
5,Second time around,"Hi, I originally wrote a review for this book in 2004. To help my then 6 year old son to Potty train. It really did help so much. Now my son is 13 and I have another 3 year old autistic son. I am buying this book again to start early and try the techniques from the beginning instead of as a last resort. I am truely excited. I just want to mention I bought my picture strips from a lady on ebay. This time my son's speech therapist is going to put them together for me using pics of my sons actual toilet etc. Thank goodness for digital camera's. That is all you need is a digital camera, a printer (print on cardstock or picture paper, and laminate (I use contact paper bought at walmart for 2.00) after laminated you can now buy velcro buttons at walmart or magnet strips."
4,"Delicious, gossipy summer read........","I bought this book as an easy summer read and that's what I got. It is written in a very gossipy style and concerns a second assistant to a major Hollywood agent. Elizabeth is the main character and has recently been transplanted as a political assistant in DC to a second assistant in LA. There are typical fitting in issues and Elizabeth does some hilarious things while trying to adjust to the LA lifestyle. Overall, a great easy read."
5,Mindless fun on an airplane...,Picked it up at the airport and had so much fun reading this book I couldn't put it down and the ending was PERFECT! Take it to the beach with you.
2,"Item Correct, Package Opened","I ordered the Anco Aerovantage 12 inch wiper blade and I received it the next day. I was impressed with how quickly they processed and shipped the item. There was a problem though. The item came in a large yellow envelope. When I took the item out of the envelope, the package of the item itself was torn open. I examined it and the blade itself was dirty, filled with black dirt. I called Amazon customer service and they will be sending a replacement to me while I will be returning this item back.I can't comment if this item is good or not until they send me the replacement."
3,Save money and skip it,"I loved ""Bridal Bargains"" and got this planner to go with it. I didn't really need it. It's a workbook but I find that I visit so many vendors that I can't fit all my notes into it. It pretty much has the same information as ""Bridal Bargains"" but less of it. Do yourself a favor and get ""Bridal Bargains"" only. Use a 3-ring binder, some dividers, and notebook paper as a planner."
3,Fine for very small jobs....,I don't see how this would cut through anything in regards to a muffler system. It's way to small for that. This is mostly used on small applications or hobby type jobs. It won't even cut off a simple muffler bolt. But I don't want to completely call it useless. Giving the right job and material it will do just fine.....but not for what I needed it for.
2,"Good Bibliography, otherwise useless","This book catalogues every way that one might put a number of notes together. There is no real insightful theory. If, for some reason, you feel a need for a printed text to give you permission to do something by virtue of cataloging it as a possibility then this book might be to your liking. The only way in which I found this tomb of any value is that it does reference many works which use a number of these possibilities. For someone interested in principles behind a lot of 20th century composition there are many more meaningful sources, such as Alan Forte's."
4,C.Crane Co. VFL Par 20 LED Flodlight,"I knew when I ordered this that it was not going to replace any of my 30W ceiling lights, but I thought there might be a good use for it anyway.The LED light is actually excellent for a desk lamp that has a downward facing shade. No heat and a fairly uniform illuminated area. I do not have one, but an articulating desk lamp would also be a good use for this light. I manually raised my fixed desk lamp above the desk to a height close to what an articulating lamp can extend to and illumination was good. An advantage over Compact Fluorescent bulbs is that this LED light is dimmable using standard light dimmers.I am now looking at other places around the house where relatively short range illumination is used.Recommended, and I will be buying more."
2,Not so Impressed,"I was excited about receiving this item because I thought it looked really nice on the website. I was disappointed when I got it though because it is very small, light, and appears cheap. I would not recommend this product."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This clock is, as someone else noted, small and cheap. The projection feature did not display full digits on the ceiling, so the time could not be read. The setting procedure did not always work as described in the directions. At $14.99 it's not worth it to me to pay postage to return it, but after less than a week of ownership, I'm tossing it in the trash. The idea is cool; the execution of the idea is a failure. Don't waste your money."
3,Ok but hard to set,"I like this product but I will say that its hard to set. Its kind of frustration because of the different options such as alarm, time, etc its only 2 ways to set those components. You have to have the directions in hand before this clock will do anything. Other than that, its a cool item to have, my son likes the clock we just need it to show us the right time."
4,My Time With God For Daily Drives,I like the idea of the CD's but I drive 1 hour each direction to work and I was looking for about a 20 minute Bible lesson. This is not it. The lessons are only 3 minutes. I am sure my friends who drive 5 to 10 minutes would love it but it is not what I was anticipating.
4,Enjoyable easy reading.,I found Tom Chase's Last Flight to be well written with an easy conversational style suggestive of the author's New England roots. Technical aspects of the pilot's trans-atlantic responsibilities and cockpit electronics seem excessive early in the book but proves valuable as the plot concludes.Upon finishing the novel I felt I had met several very interesting peple.
1,black toilet seat,"The toilet seat arrived with scratches all over the top, but I am using it anyway. Another sad part is I had to glue the hinges down to make them stay in place. Guess you get what you pay for - I will be looking for a better quality (specialty black) toilet seat in the very near future."
1,Beware the shoddy product,"I own this for less than 1 week and the screws that hold the lid have come out and are stripped. As a rule, I read reviews before ordering. I'm so sorry I didn't this time. Do not waste your money!"
5,Excellent,I have been a Dark Shadows fan since the show was first on the air. I have most of the books published about the show and this is one of the best. Highly recommended!
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this DVD on the assumption that it would contain quite a bit of vintage tornado footage. Instead what I got was a PSA on tornadoes from the 1950's with very little tornado footage. Its not a bad little PSA but since its from forever ago its pretty outdated and contains some false information. In addition the fact that its only 14 minutes begs that another tornado film or two to be placed on this DVD. The only good thing I can say is that is does have footage of the Warner Robins, Georgia tornado from April 30th 1953 which my grandparents happened witness."
1,Bad dog,"The dog barking is so fake...no dog barks like that.After many positioning trys,could not get the item to work properly...even thru glass."
4,Works as intended,"I've been using this unit for 4 months now, and it works as advertised. The barking is pretty reallistic, and only somebody repeatedly testing it would pick up on the repeating barking patterns. The unit is almost TOO sensitive, as it will go off even when walking behind it once activated. This isn't a problem for us, as we are generally gone when it is activated. This is a decent product."
1,Snooze Fest,"My family loves playing card/dice/board games. I bought this dice game because the lady at the checkout counter (that's where game was displayed) said it was so addicting and oh so much fun. After playing our first round, I actually went back and re-read the instructions a few times thinking I was missing something. Nope, all you do is roll dice, follow left, right, center for chips and game is over in 3 minutes. We could barely get through 4 games before I tossed it in the ""donating to charity bin."" How in the world this game received over 100 (5) star reviews on Amazon really makes me wonder if the majority of reviews are fake, gosh, I love Amazon and hope not, or people are that simple-minded; please say it aint' so!!!!"
5,More bang for your buck,"I played this game at our neighbours. Looks simple..it is! That's what makes it so much fun. The more people the better. We played with just adults, but I plan to play it with the whole family for Christmas! We also used 3 nickels....just for fun!Try it! We did....and we LOVE IT!"
5,Amazons' smart game,"Find this game not only entertaining but it can be educational. I live in an assisted living facility and several of our residents,minimum 90 years of age have played this game and enjoy it immensely. I feel it helps to keep our minds sharp."
3,Fun Game,Fun game with a group of people. Many people we know like to add to the excitement by using quarters or dollars instead of chips! Great for family game night or a group of friends and/or family. Very easy to learn and quick play.
4,Fun for everyone,"Great fun for all ages...we play this game with 1 dollar bills, candy, quarters...anything can be used. Our kids love to play, but usually for a few pieces of candy. This is going to be our next Christmas game. Everyone will bring 3 of a variety of items...3 ones, 3 candy bars, 3 quarters...it'll make for a fun Christmas..."
4,Good with one flaw.,"I bought this CD thinking I finally have Atlantic Starr Radiant. The sound quality is great. I have had it for a few months and I was listening to it today and notice that on the song Under Pressure it had a flaw. I thought maybe something was on the CD causing the skip. Not so. Right before it goes into the first chorus, there is some singing missing. I know these songs very well and was shocked to see that this CD has that kind of a flaw."
5,Kaytee Supreme Food for Dove,I have a Mourning Dove who fell out of a nest ten years ago. I started him on Kaytee baby bird formula with a syringe and moved him on to adult food. Over the years I have tried other dove foods but his favorite is Kaytee Supreme Food. He is thriving and loves this food. He is a happy healthy bird!
3,My daughter loves this!!!,"My 3-1/2 year old daughter loves this toy. She's just getting into the My Little Pony toys and this is one of her faves. She decorated it with the stickers when she first got it, but now they're mostly gone. She doesn't mind though, just enjoys playing with it. She pretends it's the mommy to the smaller ponies. I recommend this toy."
5,Christmas present for my husband.,Husband loves this series. So great to have it on one disc. He will zip through it and we'll get the next one.
4,To Own a Dragon: Reflections on Growing Up w/o a Father,"Love the book on CD. I am a therapist, and I have and will continue to recommend it to many of my clients, as well as, friends. I loved the way Donald allowed God to father him instead of turning bitter and resentful because his earthly father left the home when Donald was a child. The wisdom, maturity and power of Donald's male role model in the book is a wonderful example of how God fathers us, and is also an example of Love and Logic principles (Parenting with Love and Logic by Foster Cline and Jim Fay). He didn't tell Donald what to do or shame him for making an unhealthy choice. His foster parent shared a story (parable) and allowed Donald to create value out of it for himself."
3,"Great gag gift, thin towel","I bought as a gift and the recipient loved it. It is really a hilarious towel. I only wish it were made of higher quality materials, The towel is very, very thin - I am not sure I would actually use it. But it is very funny. A great gag gift, but don't expect to see it hanging off of a towel hook in the bathroom."
3,Idiots,If any of the people writing bad reviews on this product had actually read the product description for this item they would all know that the dimensions are 2'x4' so of course it doesn't cover two adults.... Research what you're buying so you don't have to complain like children for no reason.
2,Could be better. Misleading immages,The picture with the couple makes the towel actually look large and soft. When it arrives you will be surprised. I was not thrilled.
2,Not Very Good,The Butt Face towel get very damp if used multiple days in a row. It works fine for single use purposes.
2,Disappointed,"I expected a lot more from this towel than was delivered. In the photo it seems as though the towel is large and plush. In reality, IT WAS NEITHER!! This is a very small towel that in no way could cover two adults as the advertisement suggests. The towel was very thin and is best suited to dry a small child at best. I give it credit for being creative and colorful but that is about it. I would not encourage anyone to purchase this product!"
3,Not scary enough!,"And that is my one real complaint about this book. I didn't find that Baxendale's writing really brought the caves on Akoshemon's moon to life. Just piling on the adjectives is no substitute for really creating what should have been an atmosphere of sheer terror.But for the rest, while ""Fear of the Dark"" has a stereotypical plot and characters, they've been planned with genuine attention to detail and operate together to create an adventure story that's interesting and well worth reading. The characterisation of the Doctor and his companions, the fiesty Tegan and the thoughtful Nyssa, is the book's strongest point."
4,Even if you only understand 10% ...,"... of what Gatton presents here, your game will advance tremendously. Definitely for advanced guitarists, there's enough deep content here to spend a few years polishing. One caveat: it's almost all oriented towards blues substitutions so if you're not interested in that aspect of guitar-playing you may be disappointed."
2,Fragile with small parts,This marble run game might be good for children 10 and older. It's extremely fragile and the parts are much smaller than other marble run games I've seen. We have a 5 and 3-year old and they lose interest quickly due to easily breaking parts and parts not fitting together well. I would go for another game if purchasing again. Not impressed.
4,Hours of educational fun,"I have 6 year old twins and they have this toy at school. It was on their Christmas list and I was so excited when I found it. Once we opened it, they played for hours. The great thing about it is that it takes a different shape everytime."
2,not the best toy,I read the other reviews and wish I had listened. This toy is such a great idea and I thought it would be great entertainment and educational for my 4 year old but It is so cheaply made. It is already broken he has a hard time with putting the pieces together. NOT Recommended.
1,Pass this by - poor quality,"I bought this for my daughter and was very disappointed. Not only did it have a limited number of pieces, which limits what you can build, the quality was really poor. The plastic is not robust and some pieces were faulty (had slight twist which made them hard to put together w/ other pieces). Returned it for refund (which went smoothly). I would instead recommend the Marble Run 68-pc. Marble Run Play Set - that one met all my expectations."
4,Great,With out spending a bundle worked very well for me. Wanted something for my personal usage and built to last well. Fullfilled my needs and quality product so far.
3,Perplexed,"I am not done reading the book yet but I am perplexed as to whether or not it is a good book. I bought the book in order to use it as a 'primer' since it gets into the actual programming almost right away and this is what interests me. (I am also in the process of reading the Predko book and, eventhough it is an excellent book, it might be going into too much details for now.)As for the Bergquist book, I am not sure what the third chapter is about (very vague) and I have found bugs in the first program already. It also does not say much about how to use MPLAB. I would have a hard time following the book if I didn't already have some knowledge of programming and microcontrollers."
1,Guide to Picmicro Microcontrollers by Carl J. Bergquist,"The worst book I've ever seen. Absolutelly no usefullinformation, period. All you will get is authorsexcitement about power of embeded microcontrollers(he must have lived under rock for past century or so)underlined with poor humor. Other than that you getsource code for some three projects (first one is 5lines long, next one is about 20 pages...).All are done in different language. Author even failsto at least identify the used language...Forget this book. Buy something from Myke Predko."
3,Waterless cookware,I love to cook with the cookware however the lids have a valve that quickly falls apart and does not hold up to normal use. The lid then does not hold the pressure in on the foods being cooked which allows the moisture to escape (these are the food moistures that would have cooked the food).
4,Extremely readable -- a valuable addition to my library,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well-written this book is. Oberdorfer knows his subject, and he is clearly a top-knotch journalist. Unlike a previous reveiewer, I don't find his writing dry at all -- compared to most history books, it is gripping and entertaining, and does a good job of describing the key players and major events without bogging down in trivia.Having grown up during the 70's and 80's (and having lost a relative to the Korean conflict), I'm fascinated to learn more about the events that were unfolding at the periphery of American consciousness during the administrations of Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., and Clinton. Despite recent developments in North Korea's nuclear standoff, the book doesn't feel out of date, as the situation today is little different than when this book was written.Highly recommended for those with an interest in East Asia, international affairs, or geopolitics."
2,not worth the $$,"I read the first several chapters of the book and felt it fell short of expectations. Fast-forwarding through to the back, I was disappointed further as it took serious psychological situations into a ""we can handle this"" approach. That is best left to a psychiatrist & counselor. Would not recommend."
2,The book could be a lot better,Marsha Linehan's book is far better written and effective. I would buy that book and skip Mr. Spradlin's book completely.I expected more. More depth. More through explanations. More insightful exercises. Mr Spradlin is a mediocre writer. He lacks clarity and could really use a better editor.The book read like a watered down version of Ms. Linehans' book.
5,love it,"i was amazed to see that this has such a bad rep. ive used mine for about a year now with no problems at all. i mean none. but at least now i know what to do if my battery starts acting up. i did also have the thing where characters ran in a circle, but only after starting a game with the pad asleep. not a problem at all. take both thumb sticks and circle them full around a few times fast and the pad wakes back up and recenters. also as someone already said, the programing software for this thing is awesome. you can do most anything on your comp with this. even use it as a remote to open specific apps that have shotcuts mapped to them and then use the sticks as a mouse. i use it in conjunction with my media center remote and surf from the couch.i had a great experience with this product.hmmm... sucks to be you. hahaha"
3,Battery issue,"The gamepad itself is a well engineered product. It fits the hand well, has many buttons and the joysticks are also a nice touch. My problem as with other reviews I have read is the battery packs. One of the two refuses to take a charge. Who knows how long the second one will last. It appears there should have been more engineering with the batterys, or at least as much as with the rest of the gamepad."
1,This one's a dud.,"I love the Saitek 880 wired gamepad. So I figured the wireless would be that much better. Unfortunately, my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems. There's nothing worse than the few times I really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out. I bought this and the batteries died. I sent Saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones. Great, they worked! Then they died soon after. Hopefully their new wireless, which runs on one AA battery will not have any issues. However, this one's a dud."
3,Better off using cotton,Preface that I may not be using this correctly but since it came with no directions my ignorance might be forgiven. I attempted to use this with a flint fire starter so it may work better (and be intended for use) with matches or lighters. Conclusion was that a small dry cotton ball worked much better.
2,Save your money,"When purchasing Mayadust I expected some type of wood shavings like fatwood or another naturally resinated product, not a thin plastic ""snuff box"" of pine sawdust I could have swept up off of my workshop floor. I originally thought the $4.50 purchase price was reasonable, but when you add in the seemingly high shipping cost, it makes this product not worth the money."
4,"Fast Shipping, Decent Quality","I ordered this stuffed animal for Halloween. It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, slightly larger than a beanie baby. Still, I'm happy with it. It shipped quickly and came a day before its estimated arrival date."
5,Christmas Gift,I ordered this for as part of a package for our Christmas toy drive. I know that the child who ends up with this toy will love.
5,Attention all you Bluesrockers!,"Yes the blues can be fun! Eric King proves it with this CD. This CD is a great start for this new artist from Northern Va., if your style of blues is with a rockin' side you'll love this one. Eric is backed up on this CD by some of the best musicians in the Mid Atlantic region. And if that isn't enough, Eric has just released his second CD, ""Shake these blues"". Eric is backed on this CD by, ""The Thin Line"", another all-star line-up. ""Eric King and The Thin Line"", are excellent on this CD and live. This CD picks up where the other one left off and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait!"
4,Good American Oi!,"Anyone who hasnt heard the Bruisers this is probably the best place to start. 28 tracks of good American Oi! here. They do a few pretty good covers too like Work Together and Nation on Fire by Blitz.Cant say I was ever too much of a fan of Dropkick Murphies but this stuff is good old traditional Oi! played as it should be. Some people say they are a mix of Oi! and American hardcore, cant say I realy get that from the tracks here, a few are speeded up but nothing realy you wouldnt hear from say 4Skins or even Blitz.Cant think of a weak track on this one. Buy it, well worth the money."
2,I couldn't get past the first chapter,"I read the first chapter and did not read any further because the author takes ten words of content and expands it into 10 paragraphs. Too little detail was provided on points of substance, while paragraphs went into great detail on what had little to do with the book's topic.For example, the author spends several pages giving descriptions of how a golf course was built and how it looked and few words on the economic and social abuse from government subsidies, how this happened, the politics, etc. - which I expected the book to cover.I don't know if the rest of the book was written this way as I was unwilling to put any more time into reading this book.Hopefully some other author will address this topic."
1,Class warfare agenda,"Come on. The bottom 50% pay 4% of the federal taxes. The top 50% pay 96% of federal taxes. What conspiracy?This is another liberal class warfare agenda piece.Don't believe me, look at the other book being marketed with it on Amazon.If you want to pay for class warfare reaffirmation -- go for it. But don't fool yourself that you are being informed. No matter how you spin it, the top 50% pay for the federal government."
3,Not good enough,"This is almost completely useless on a 1999 Chevy Suburban with a 5.7 liter engine. It looks like a great design, but it still doesn't seem to help much with the tight areas I tried to use it in, which is what it was purchased for."
1,By the time I broke them in the soles were worn out.,I've had rockport shoes for years and thought they were all very comfortable with durable soles.These shoes were the complete opposite.The back of the shoe that rides above your heal has no padding so it wears against your foot.It was more like my shoes were breaking me in instead of me breaking my shoes in.I had to buy padding to put in there since my foot was getting raw each time I wore them.The soles are already worn out but I've only owned them for 9 months!Horrible shoes! Very disappointed.
4,Great value,"I am very happy with this computer. Had if for a few months and it has performed pretty well. I am not much of a gamer so I can't vouch for that aspect, but as an everyday computer used for internet, email, burning files and dvds, etc, it does everything well. Come with Vista and Windows Media Center which is pretty cool. Comes with tv tuner so I can watch and record shows with the windows DVR. Can also burn the recorded shows to DVD and play them back on my tv DVD player.Had a minor problem with set up and had to call the HP help line. Tough to understand the guy from India but we got through it and havn't had any problems since."
5,The mIrror prince,"This is a fast paced novel. For such a stand alone book it hashas unsually well-developed fantasy world. Such development usually takes a longer book or a multiple volume series. Unlike the profssional review, I like time Malan spent develping the faerie culture and history. It has a good mistusre of humor and seriousness, plus a few unexpected surprises."
4,We All Live in One,"Seems sturdy - the only reason I rated it a 4 star was that it tends to curl a bit (It's ALIVE!!!). I guess I can deal with a curly yellow submarine. I like it because I drive a yellow submarine (not curly, though)."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"What an incredible disappointment. Typos galore, and answers that do not match up with the questions (#66-68)are just a couple reasons NOT to buy this book. Here's what you need to know about the Praxis: 150 questions, 2 hours, less than one minute per question (so manage your time), you need a scaled score of about 60% to pass...that's roughly 95 questions correct out of 150. Study your Neuro, speech science, anatomy, hearing aids. If you're desperate, get a bunch of students together and buy one copy of this book to share. What a waste of money. :("
2,Too Extreme,"The build-up is in the mode of Patricia Highsmith with some wonderful psychological suspense and a not-very-likeable main character who nonetheless is interesting. There is some terrific imagery along the way, but the ending is gruesome, tortured and grotesque. L'Heureux can certainly write but I just kept wondering how much of this was cheap entertainment for himself."
2,Save your money,"I'm glad the library bought a copy of this book. I usually read more than one book at a time and Schulman doesn't fare well compared to Roth or Hamilton. I was intrigued at first, thinking here was a female answer to some of Updike's recent over the hill (and oversexed) male characters. Alas, the book disappointed me. It needed more careful editing, among other things. It could have been one-third shorter if some of the padded writing had been tightened. It was funny in spots, but the book is an example of a good premise spoiled."
3,P.S.........I LIKED it!!!!!,I can't say I loved this book....I didn't.....but I really liked it. The concept of F. Scott and Sctt was cool but different and really far-fetched in my eyes. I really like Louise...Missy...however.... was the kind of person I'd love to stomp on!!!!!
3,R-rated,"I rate this book a 3 because Schulman is an amazing writer and this is a great concept and a well-written story, but I couldn't get through it. If you would rather not read bad language and sex scenes, as I would rather not, I just write this review as a warning so you'll know what to expect. It would have been a fun book to read."
5,I Was There,"In regards to this review: ""This CD is absolute poo, mainly due to the amateur musicianship of Jeff Lauras. Avoid at all costs""Jeff did not play on this record."
3,cute..but,not worth the price..the materials used to make it are super cheap and therefore it looks cheap
3,Good Features But No Foreman,"I have owned several Foreman grills in the past and liked them except for the cleaning. I saw the Hamilton Beach 25326 Contact Grill with Removable Grids and thought how this would be the answer to my problems with cleaning. The grill does clean up well but it seems to take forever to cook. I usually cook frozen patties and the Foreman took 6-8 minutes to cook, this one took 15-20. I had to turn over the burgers to get both sides done. The biggest problem is the cooking time, I don't think the grill heats up as hot nor does the heat last as long. Overall it's not that bad but not quite as good as the Foreman"
4,"right price, right combination of features, not exaclt easy to keep clean","I purchased this grill in July 2006, and it has performed without failure since (although I do not share it anymore). I had just lost a HB grill due to excessive usage by me and my roommate. We had inherited the first grill from a foreign student who was returning to Persia. I saw that GF grills were too much (unless its Christmas or something), and even the HB at the local WMT were not exactly what I wanted. The problem with the old one was that the wiring actually frayed at the hinge. Make sure you get a grill with internal wiring. or a solid looking hinge (where it bends). I liked the features of temp control, removable grills, and the hinge design. It still is not exactly easy to keep clean, but who likes washing dishes anyway? lol. The one thing these geniuses could add is a simple on/off switch. Does it not feel unsophisticated to just jerk the wire from the socket when you are finished?"
2,Sizing was waaaay off!,"This was a bad choice. I had to return this bra. I ordered a 40DD and it was about a 38C. I'd used the sizing chart and measured myself. 40DD is my usual size so I did not expect any problems, but I almost choked myself getting this off. The bra itself was nicely made, but it was not true to size."
3,"it's a bit ""droopy""","this bra is ok i guess for a wirefree. The problem I have with it is the breasts look a bit droopy and shapeless unless I tighten the straps to the tightest possible, and that hurts my shoulders. Also the center doesn't lie flat on my breastbone, so it looks sort of like a sports bra ""uni-boob"" (I think that's because I have large boobs, there's no way a wirefree could divide 'em LOL)the fabric is pretty nice though. But I think I'll stick with underwire for the best support. This bra could work for you nicely if you aren't huge on top."
2,Nice bra wrong fit,I really liked the bra but it didn't fit me right. The cups fit but it was too tight by the arms...will be returning
4,Controller starter kit,This works fine as advertised and the only reason that it didn't get five start is that it isn't wireless - but it's loads less expensive!
4,Good value for $$$$$$,"I can't complain it still works, every components is still working fine, what can i say this is good value for money laterz."
4,Nice Collection of Many Literature work of Kanafani,"Very nice collection and translation of Kanafani's literature work. Very touching stories that resembles the Palestinian's tragedy during the last century, coming from the most honorable and respected journalist and writer Ghassan Kanafani."
1,Would never buy again,"I bought this machine with the highest of hopes that it would last for years and years with good care. Before the first year was up, the power switch stopped working. Although it was covered by service contract, i had to drive 35 miles one way to take it for repair. (and the repain man was not at all pleasant) That first repair lasted three weeks, the second repair lasted 2 weeks and since then it has never worked at the switch. The self propell feature has been stuck in the on position for 2 years. I would never ever purchase a Hoover again. I would have loved to give a glowing review! Sorry Hoover !!!!! Honesty IS the best policy !"
1,what a disappointment ...,"The film was badly made and poorly acted. The story, while sad, was completely irrealistic, the depiction of the characters superficial and far from any reality as well, the dialogues trivial if not stupid. This is not a film I can recommend to an educated audience which is used to a certain intellectual standard. It's - to use one ""mean"" word - East Bloc.What made things worse is that I could at no moment relate to the main character: He is not a poor little boy who is drawn into the hustler/porn scene by circumstances. He is a stubborn youngster who runs away from a loving home and from school, who actively looks for the hustler scene, but who is not intelligent enough to survive- first he has the old pimp (whatever his name is, Monza or something like that) take advantage of him, then another hustler.The film bores you, it is not drastic or realistic or strong at all (like I hoped it would be). Honestly, I watched the last hour or so in fast forward mode."
1,Terrible!,"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Since I purchased the movie, I felt that I had to watch it but it was painful to do so. I fast forwarded much of it because it was so bad and unbelievable. Stewart Granger deserved a better fate than to be seen in such a movie. Thank goodness that it was not any longer."
2,Required reading for my class,"This was a required book for one of my digital security classes. It's very basic and talks about typical tools such as tracert and ping. If you've been around a network for very long, skip this book and move to something more advanced."
5,Erma Brombeck is reborn,"I so enjoyed the quips, stories and humor of the late Erma Brombeck and miss her column. Rose Mula's stories take me back there, and boy can I identify with many of them. Humor to laugh at the characters and yourself is a great stress reliever. I am thankful to the author for her witty accounts of everyday life. Forge on!"
2,Strictly By The Numbers (and fairly low numbers at that),"Boston Blackie and his sidekick ""Runt"" go through the standard paces in a strictly by the numbers episode of their series in ""A Close Call for Boston Blackie"". I've collected 6 espisodes of this series and so far this is the least insteresting of them. Though the history of the Boston Blackie charactor goes back a while, the film series follows the far more successful Thin Man series in production, without that series wonderful witty writting, acting or production. Boston Blackie is produced on a shoestring and the writting is very low grade and simple. The cookie cutter police charactors of Farraday and his dim witted side kick would make you wonder if they could solve any case beyond jay walking. If you want clever, intelligent mystery/detective writting, watch the Thin Man, Miss Marple or Philo Vance series, leave Boston Blackie on the shelf."
1,There are MUCH Better Alternatives To Low Carb Cookbooks,"I wouldn't recommend this book to the low carber looking for a good low carb cookbook. Quite a few of the ingredients are pretty obscure for regular people like you & me. I've YET to find Celery Root and have checked at just about every grociery store here in town. I've made a couple of the recipes and the worst one ever was the cornbread recipe. If you want a really good low carb cookbook...check out George Stella's cookbooks, especially his newer one or even Dana Carpender's cookbooks. I have alot of low carb cookbooks and this one is bottom of my list for cookbook choices."
3,The Low Carb,Have not used it as of this date but am looking forward to doing so. Had to change my lifestyle and hopefully this will be a good benefit in my attack on my body fat.
3,Very Disappointing,"Just received this boxed set today. I expected much more. The type and examples are very, very small, with many ""thumbnails"" less than one inch square. The designs in the Layout Index are poor quality, in my opinion. The Idea Index contains 400 pages of lightbulb graphics and over-use of metallic ink (and I'm normally a big fan of metallic ink.) PMS colors are not mentioned anywhere. Anyone can buy a computer and call him/herself a designer, and these books prove that point well. I'm certainly glad I only paid the discounted price, because these books are certainly not worth $60."
3,good set,nice set for when you need some quick inspiration. clear plastic carrying case keeps books in good shape too.
5,Great buy,This is a great product. It combines the features of a Bible storybook for two different ages with a true complete Bible. It has great helps such as a dictionary that puts terms into simple language that can be understood by young children. The artwork is also beautifully done.
1,Dimensions not true!,"I am very dissapointed in this product. First of all, the dimensions stated in the sellers description, are not true at all. I measured one piece of fence. It is 6 inches long, and 1/2 inch high. I bought this product for my son for his play farm. IT looks totally ridiculous because the picket fence is so small. His fake animanls are taller than the fence. Especially the cows and horses. The box has a price tag of $1.50 on it. I paid $7.19 for it. Very deceiving."
5,"a ""must"" for CWG 1-readers!","it is incredible; I thought I understood CWG 1. But when I did the ""home-work"" suggestet (lovingly) in the Guide Book... if you choose to live the messenges of CWG, this book will be of great help."
2,Mob story,"I was looking for a good mystery. This story is primarily about a young chef's experience with the mob. The environment is more New Jersey ""Goodfellas"" than a kitchen. Mob pressure , crime and threats were not what I hoped to find in the story."
3,"Lots of fun, but not stable - tips over","My 10 month old absolutely loves this toy. She pulls herself up to standing on it very regularly. We expected the Incrediblock to be more stable than it is. Sometimes as she's trying to pull herself up, she actually pulls the block down on top of her. Since it's not heavy, it doesn't hurt her, but it's ended up upside down in her play area pretty regularly.That being said, she loves the toy and it keeps her occupied for fairly long periods of time."
3,"Came highly recommended, but...","It is a great toy for infants learning to stand and play. They do discover the different functions gradually which adds to the longevity of the toy. My two 18 month old granddaughters still play with it. They discovered right away that you can wedge toys into the top and jam the revolving display. This is hard on batteries. They have also been frustrated with the lever controlling whether or not the blocks drop down as it is difficult to push and does not always hold the blocks in. The side with the ""mirror"" has almost no play value. The storage bin is probably the most attractive feature to my granddaughters. I think they could have included more activities on this toy for the price."
2,Fun toy but broke way too easily!,"My 12 month old had this toy for exactly two days before it broke. The main defect is that the spinning top turns around and plays music, but when the child pushes on it, it makes a horrible noise and stops moving, and it broke on us the second day. A toy for young children should me much more durable than this!"
1,Get the new vtech alphabet activity cube instead!,"The vtech alphabet activity block is like the incrediblock but better, just as educational if not more, cheaper ($40), and don't have the expensive replacement blocks! The spinning wheel on top of the incrediblock seems really stupid bc when kids rest their elbow on it (it's on the top of the block remember??), it almost ruins the toy. Only 8 peekablocks ""speak"" whereas on the vtech toy, if you put the alphabet blocks in, it says each of the 26 letters! Like the incrediblock, the vtech toy also has a storage area for the blocks -- the replacement peekablocks are ridiculously expensive! Also, the batteries on the incrediblock drain VERY quickly! Put a new set of batteries into the incrediblock and batteries drained an hr later barely after any use except for the wheel on top to spin. Check it out at http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007XVYQBI"
1,not good enough,"bought this for my daughters birthday. She enjoys it as much as any other toy, but I was disapointed with the quality and variety. Does not spin without a block. Putting the blocks into the shape sorter or plug n play does nothing. Knobs and flip doors do nothing. Just not good enough"
3,Should've waited for the updated version : (,"I agree with some previous comments:1. There so needs to be a cover over the top of the animal spinner.2. The space where you drop the blocks is not at all fun or educational.3. The stickers and the mirror need to be revamped.4. The place where the blocks come out is way to loud.5. The motor is terribly loud.My son does enjoy the ""incrediblocks"" and he loves the animal sounds, but he is consantly holding the spinner on top making a terrible noise until he moves his hand. He was 7 months old when I bought it, the is now 12 months old. He still plays with it, but I would like to see the next version."
3,Good but overrated,"I purchased this when my son was about 8 months old. He loves the fact the top part spins and makes music, but other than that it offers very little. For example, the red side panel with a giraffe does not offer anything interesting or educational. Side panels do very little and my son shows very little interest in them. Now he is 18 months old and just hits the top button to make music and moves on to doing something else. This cube looks pretty nice but it is disappointing that it does not offer as much as the manufacturer promises and it takes up more space than it actually needs. It also tumbles quite easily if you have a crawler who wants pull himself up with it. If I knew what I know now I would have never bought it."
4,my 3 year old likes it as much as my 9 month old,I wish that it was a little bigger. my 3 year old plays with it more then my 9 month old. make sure that you order more blocks because it doesn't come wtih that many. i don't know if i would buy it again but we do like it.
5,Fun for everyone!,"We got this for our 8 month old for Christmas and he hasn't stopped playing with it, and neither has his 5 year old brother! They each sit on one side and play with the blocks, and activities. The baby is thirlled each time the music plays and claps and dances, and while he hadn't been interested in pulling up to anything yet, I found him this morning on his knees playing with the spinning top. The 5 year old has forsaken his gobs of 'big boy' toys to sit and play with this for hours at a time. What a hit!! Great fun."
4,Peek a Boo blocks,"I like the toy and my daughter did learn to pull up using this toy, but what I don't understand is why they would make some blocks that don't work with the thing on top that says what's in the block. When you put certain blocks on top, it says, ""cow"" or ""horn"" when that's not what is in the block. That's very confusing for a child trying the learn the names of things. They should have made all of the Peek A Boo blocks compatible with the cube."
2,it broke,my 10 month old broke this in a matter of minutes. He broke the spinning wheel so it makes an awful grinding sound. Spinning wheel should have a cover to prevent this from happening
2,disappointed,"We bought this toy for our son when he was 10 months old, and had bad luck 3 times in a row with the lights and music being broken right out of the box. It may apppear durable, but the electrical features are quite flawed. Our son likes his peek a blocks and there are other toys that are much more value for the dollar like the wagon. We ended up returning it because he showed zero interest in it."
5,Great Vid!,"Decent production, good music, good host, GREAT story/adventure! I just received this yesterday and have watched it twice already. Resolution isn't the best on the large screen tvs, but it still looks pretty good. I'd buy this again any day!"
4,explore the real stories,"YEH MERA INDIA is an attempt to explore the real stories behind the headlines. These stories deal with racial bias, communal bias, caste bias, class bias, gender bias, lingual bias and immigrant bias that plague the society. It is a story of one day in the life of 12 people from different strata of Mumbai city, which is a melting pot of cultures.The film has an ensemble cast and the actors infuse life in their characters. In fact, every actor in YEH MERA INDIA leaves a mark, but the ones who stand out are Anupam Kher, Parvin Dabas, Vijay Raaz, Atul Kulkarni, Seema Biswas, Rajpal Yadav and Smilie Suri.YEH MERA INDIA is a film that grows on you. It's a film that the aam aadmi would connect with."
4,Paul-Antoine Taillefer is delightful as Phillipe!,"L'ESCORTE is a stylish examination of the effect a ""paid male escort"" has on the lives and fortunes of Phillipe and Jean-Marc, a pair of longterm gay lovers. The beautiful and talented French actor Paul-Antoine Taillefer perfectly portrays Phillipe, the leading man character, as an altruistic naif. And, though slightly less adorable and slightly less handsome, the characters who surround him as just as adroitly realized.However, as wonderful as the film's first 80 minutes are, the story's unfortunate ""walk into the sunset"" denouement ties up all the loose fray in a rather cheesy package.Still, putting that aside, when the script is all said and done, it is mostly Taillefer who makes this carefully subtitled French flick worthwhile and memorable, despite some faults at the conclusion.It definitely belongs in your collection of gay male cinema."
5,great fun,brought the shock duel to thanksgiving with my family. we all had a great time with it. even my grammom got into the action! was a good time!mark
5,Excellent General History,"Parrish covers the history of submarines from ancient times right up to the present. Naturally enough, he concentrates on 20th Century submarine development and employment, though earlier attempts at creating a functional submarine are also mentioned.As in any general history, the author has to compromise. There are places where you might wish for a bit more detail. Just the coverage of submarine operations, both Axis and Allied, in World War II could easily fill two or three books of this size. Still, he does a fine job.This is a good book for anyone who thinks he might be interested in the general use and development of the submarine as a weapon. The bibliography lists plenty of other books that will allow him to expand his knowledge."
2,Not Really Sure Who This is Supposed to Fit,"I ordered this as a hands free way to communicate during theatre productions. I could not even get it to comfortably fit onto my ear. I'm not really sure how this was designed to work, but it is a poorly executed design. It felt and looked sturdy enough until I tried it on. The only way I could get it to stay on was to have it's strange spring clip pinching my earlobe. Maybe my ears are too small..."
1,1 star is too high,I HATE this book. It put our family into debt buying things while I was pregnant. I ended up returning half of the things I bought and my entire baby registry. These 2 people base this book on their own thoughts. Who the hell are they? It's nothing more than consumer fraud.
1,Ick!,"This book is freaky. It is all about baby stuff that no one buys.. like all the stuff that sits on the shelf at Wal Mart and then gets sold at Big Lots. There are no super-cool things in it at all. If you want to be a dowdy mom with no style, listen to the advice of this author. I found a much better book out there.. I'll post my review on that tomorrow... not finished reading it yet. This one is just icky."
1,I'm a lover not a fighter,"I'm with Ick. This book had way too many listings and made registering a nightmare for me and my friends. We ALL hate this book. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Gallagher Report. Also, LOVE LOVE LOVE Consumer Reports. This book is written by a writer not a researcher. This book ain't worth the library card to check it out. I did like the 1000 Best Baby Bargains by Kimberly Danger. That book REALLY helps you save money. I also heard this author's other books really suck. I found the 411 book at the dollar store!"
4,Great book for first time mom!,This was extremely helpful when registering for my shower. As a first time mom I had no idea what products were safe or better than others...While the helpful moms in most baby departments offered up a thousand suggestions it was nice to have handy reference guide along for the trip.I would recommend this to other first time moms or even moms who like to comparison shop!
4,"A ""Must Have"" for new parents","Very helpful when registering for first baby. The experience is overwhelming, and this book helps you navigate. The index in the back allows you to flip to whatever you need, right in the store...."
2,Not What I Expected....,"Hmmmm, how to start? I read an interview with Rhys Fulver (reunited band member) who said Civilization was FLA's best album to date and only time would tell that. I'm sorry to say it's Not their best album, it's not even close. There is a time and a place for ""tranced-out"" tracks like these, I feel they should have been done under another project name.You cannot fault the creative output of an Artist, you can only hope that as they go along in the years, they get better (see Killing Joke). This would be a better album if I was not expecting Front Line Assembly....If you like the watered-down output of alot of other industrial artists these days (see Front 242...), maybe this will be right for you. I won't put down any more money for FLA."
5,2nd edition is now available!,"Click on Stafford's name above to find the link for his 2nd ed.! Then read my review: ""Deepens your appreciation of the Bible while defending JWs, February 13, 2001"". See you there..."
4,Good product,did not have as concentrated pork flavor as I thoiught it would. still worked great for what I bought it for
3,CD Downgraded to Underperform........,"I enjoy many of the songs on this CD. Like other comments I have read, I was very disappointed that ""Times a Wastin"" was not included on this soundtrack. I guess ""disappointed"" is not an accurate description. I WAS TICKED OFF !!!!!!! ""Times a Wastin"" was one of the BEST SONGS in the whole movie. Reese and Joaquin shined singing this together. WHY? WHY? WHY? I just graduated from Anger Management 101, which prevented me from ripping my bathroom sink off the wall after discovering this omission."
4,Johnny Cash's Turbulent History,"The CD of the soundtrack ""I walk the Line"" is excellent but might disappoint ardent Johnny Cash Fans who have not seen the film. I enjoyed the film but it concentrated too much on his drugs problem than on his music. Having been a Member of the Johnny Cash Fan Club (England) since 1957 I am a purist. Happy to sell a framed Black & White Official Photograph duly authenticated of Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two (not then 'Three'!) to the highest bidder!"
1,Johnny Cash is turning over in his grave,"Arlo Guthrie said ""the world gets more stupid everyday"" this just goes to show how true that is. The fact that anyone would use a hair lipped actor who can't sing a lick, over actual Johnny Cash recordings, is an outright travesty and should make everyone sick."
1,Not the same sound as the movie,"I bought this CD expecting it to sound just like the music in the movie. All I can say is that it isn't anything like the movie soundtrack on DVD. This could have been a really good CD, but the music is flat and lifeless. It's too bad that I can't play my DVD in the car disc player because it sounds great. Why the CD music is not good and doesn't include all the music from the movie is anybody's guess. It's too bad. The song samples are not available through Amazon, but they can be found if you google for it. Do a search and you will see what I am talking about."
2,walk the line,"Not impressed. I thought the music would be enjoyable after seeing the movie over a year ago but have found that I don't enjoy it at all. I should have looked for a ""best of"" type cd with original artists."
2,Not a soundtrack,"How can they call this a soundtrack when it has songs that weren't in the movie, and doesn't have songs that WERE in the movie! In fact, the song I liked most in the movie isn't on here. What a rip-off!"
4,Johnny v. Joaquin,"I'm pleased Reece picked up the little gold man for her potrayal of June Carter (Mrs Cash) but disappointed that Joaquin missed out. Both of them are a knockout in the movie and the fact they sing and in Reece's case LEARNT to sing for the role says much about their ability. I live in the mountains just outside Sydney a three hour journey each day and this CD makes the driving so enjoyable.Loved the movie, the music and Amazon for their excellent service.Thank you and G'Day."
3,It can't beat the real thing,"I grew up listening to Johnny Cash and have always been a big fan of his. Like Elvis and the Beatles, his music is timeless and very good. It's wonderful that a film like ""Walk The Line"" is now giving the young people of today a chance to discover what a great and gifted talent Johnny Cash was. The music on the soundtrack is alright and the actors do a good enough job with the songs but I have to recommend that if you want to hear John's music and enjoy it to the fullest, buy the CDs from the real Johnny Cash. They are much better. ""The Essential Johnny Cash"" can't be beat and is the one to buy if you want all of his best."
4,Great - But Wasted Opportunity,"Having lived my life with Johnny and June as background music, I was doubtful if anyone, particularly non-professional musicians, could do them justice. But I was wrong. They really get into the songs and capture their spirit. But I was greatly disappointed that they didn't include ""Time's A Wastin"" on the CD, as it's my favorite song from the movie, and I'll never forget the emotion and power of the scene where they sing it! How about an encore edition of the CD that includes it?"
2,The best song is missing from this soundtrack!,"The soundtrack does NOT have the best duet of the movie, 'Time's a Wastin' so make up your own mind if it's worth the price."
5,"Walk the Line, The greatest CD of this year","When I first listened to this cd I thought,""Wow,Joaquin sounds almost like Jonny Cash."" It was a great cd. I'm not a really huge country fan. But ""Walk the Line"" is the only country music I will listen to. If you liked the movie, you will love this cd."
2,DVD Recorded Versions of Songs Better than Soundtrack's,"I have this and the DVD. The DVD movies' versions are better than the versions recorded on this soundtrack CD. They are not the same recordings.The soundtrack CD versions are lacking in (audio and instumental/vocal)quality enough to notice the difference easily.If you are hoping for the same vocal and instrumental musical quality, energy, and emotion of the DVD movie versions, you will not get it with this soundtrack CD.On top of this you will NOT get the song ""Times a Wastin"", a great and very key song in the movie.Granted it is the only way to get the complete song.Everyone involved in this CD production should be ashamed of what they produced here in comparison to the movie."
3,This is not a live album or original soundtrack!,"I bought this album thinking it would be a live album, as it is labeled the original motion picture soundtrack. Beware, because it is NOT.These are studio recordings (although with lots of echo) made by the original cast. Althoug quite nice, they do not match the elctrifying atmosphere of the live performances shown in the movie by a long shot."
2,What is the customer service ?,"The book has not CDs, and I have to bough CD from Internet. So the price of used book + CD equal to new book. I emailed the book seller, they told me they would return me 10% of the book (1/2 of CD price), but now I haven't received the cash back. It is cheating 2 times."
1,Without the CD this book is useless,"The CD which comes with this book contains the best stuff from the book and you have to pay about $30 for each semester you want to read the info from the CD. The book is full of examples, but little how to use the info or even how the examples used the info to get to their success."
3,Cezanne is great but this book could have been better,"The clumsy, poorly written text in the first few chapters is almost impossible to read. Since it's so disjointed and quotes too much from Cezanne's personal letters or from other writings, I skipped over a large portion of this. I was also surprised that the authors tried to make Cezanne into some sort of religious deity, rather than a master of his art; it could be marketing hype accompanying the show, but Cezanne's work speaks for itself. In spite of these flaws, the painting and sketches are wonderfully reproduced, and the accompanying description is pretty good. But because the accompanying description is always laudatory and doesn't adequately talk about his mistakes, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between Cezanne's masterpieces and his OK work. The best part is learning what other artist, such as Monet and Matisse, owned what Cezanne painting (and then trying to speculate on why they liked a painting so much)."
2,Very Heavy and Dense and not quite gingery!,"To each, his own...there may be people who will like this, but for us, it was extremely heavy and not much spice flavor to it. It was very moist and the consistency was good, but the whole wheat makes it a very heavy cake. What we didn't care for most is the flavor...or lack thereof. I think it might be ok if you add powdered spices to it when you are mixing it. Maybe some ginger, cloves, nutmeg, etc...It sorta reminds me of boston brown bread you buy in the can when made as directed. So, not our cup of tea, but you may like it. It's not horrible...just not for us."
2,West Bend Versatility Deluxe,"I purchased this for my daughter and then one for myself. My daughter's pan was warped and did not cook evenly. When I contacted the manufacturer I received a very tepid response. I even offered to purchase another pan to fit on the base,but I was told that size was not available. I always had a high regard for West Bend products when they were manufactured in the USA but since they are now made in China the quality is not the same. I will not be buying their products in the future.Angeline Shattuck"
1,Make it stop,"Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through. Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.' This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread. I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger. I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction. And the afterword by the author seemed smug. I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never."
2,tedious reading,"Even with the cheesy plot this might have been interesting as a short story, but no way could it keep my interest as a full length novel. Mr Koontz has written much better."
3,Great beginning. The end.,"The beginning of this book had me hooked and I could not put it down. Then....I was lost. I struggled through the middle. Everything that happened at the end could have happened sooner and spared us a big, boring part of the book. Starting this book, I had mixed feelings as it was about the author. I had read a real BAD book by him and an outstanding book by him. So, I was going to try this one. I was disappointed. If you are looking for a real thrill ride or scare book, read Intensity. It will blow your mind."
5,Wow!,"This is one of the most satifying books I have ever read with the most awesome villian that I have ever seen in any novel and I've read quite a bit. The guy took a bullet in the head, regenerated himself and came back for more. Now that was just plain cool. Right up there with Midnight, Dark Rivers and Soul Survivor and Intenstiy. Keep it up."
4,It is an alternate review of an alternate book on an alternate Japan,"I liked the book for what it was. Entertainment, period. It is not a historical novel, nor does it try. I like the picture it presents and I like it because it is not real. The book is a little slow in places, but I still purchased the next book in the series and the prequel also. If you want a factual history book, look elsewhere. If you want a story to entertain you, this series has done the trick for me. The first book ""Across the Nightingale Floor""Across the Nightingale Floor (Tales of the Otori, Book 1)was the most entertaining, but I found the entire series has something to offer as well."
5,Simply the best birthday present ever,"This book along with the two prior books were sent to me as a birthday present. These books are simply the best present I have ever received. I have read and re-read them time and time again. I finshed this third book in two sittings it is thatterrific! Breathtaking beautiful,lyrical, and beyond description - it's what great classics should be. Thank God my brother-in-law sent them. Order them now, sit back and enjoy the timeless realm, battles, conflicts and life of ancient Japan. You will not be sorry!"
4,Satisfying conclusion,"Though the first third of this novel is slowed by political and military maneuvering, there is more narrative and less character interaction than I would have liked, and Kaede plays less of a prominent role, this is an engaging and satisfying conclusion to the trilogy."
1,Could we now please have the version she meant to print?,"This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy. I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned. I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed. After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines. To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books."
1,Wiper Blades,This was stated to fit my 2011 Chevrolet Equinox ltz. It does not. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
2,"""Quick Switch"" worth $99??? Not even close","I purchased the belt based on the recommendations of the previous reviews in this section. I chose this one over the several others listed in the category.It certainly looked and sounded appealing, specificaly, being able to quickly add or subtract the individual pouches. After opening the shiping box and seeing/feeling the flimsy belt and the small puches, I felt robbed. Nonetheless, I tried it out for three weeks. After the third week, I dumped it and went back to my old tool pouch.This would be a nice product in the $40 price range, but at $100, it's way too expensive.This is a average weekend-warrior belt. Serious users should stay away."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!","When my DVD arrived and I saw that the cover was different than that pictured on Amazon, and that the case had no mention of ""VCI"" or ""The Rank Collection"" but instead displayed that it was produced by ""Inspired Distribution"" (""Visit us at: [...]""), and that I had just recently been supremely dissapointed by the quality of transfer for another movie that came from Inspired Distribution (see my review of ""Spitfire: The First of the Few"", called ""Horrible Transfer!""), I then realized I was just about to open another dissapointment. No way! Not a second time! The common denominator is that these products are both sold by ""Ocean Breeze Media"" out of Miami Beach, Florida. I will not buy another product sold by them! BTW, if you go to the Inspired Distribution website listed on case reverse (see above), you will NOT find either of these products. What's going on with these poor reproductions?"
3,A Good Movie,This one gives us a great deal more understanding of the sacrifices suffered my some of our allies in our quest to remain free.
3,Not compelling.,"I was curious to see what this movie was like, and I confess it was curiosity mostly wasted. It's interesting to see in a historical context of treatment of the subject. But it is otherwise worthy of being forgotten."
5,Great Black Metal,"Immortal play great, plain black metal. They dont use synthesizers, and those kind of stuff, and it sounds great. Guitars, bass, drums, everything The vocals seem weird at first, but they mix well with the music. If you dont like the idea of ""black"" metal, like i did some time ago, you must check it out and you will know its great. And if you like it you can look for Mayhem and Dimmu Borgir (not the same kind but as Immortal but if you like it you probably will enjoy it too) So what are you waiting for?"
2,"Slow Kill, slow read.","I love most of McGarrity's books, but can't help but wonder if he's running out of steam - or maybe turning out too many books, too often."
3,Need for Speed,"A fine procedural, but this series is losing action. More like a textbook than a novel. Each book adds characters, why not some action?"
1,Waste of a Celluloid.,"Viewed: 3/09Rate: 23/09: So, where is the controversy? Nothing seems to happen in ...And God Created Woman. Where is the nudity? Jeez, what a crock waste of time. Brigitte Bardot teases her way through ...And God Created Woman and never takes off her clothes. So much for anticipation. Tell me again the reason why the movie was made in the first place. All in all, the only thing that saved ...And God Created Woman is the nice cinematography of Saint Tropez."
1,Stiff sheets,I have the Wamsutta 300TC sateen sheets and they are MUCH softer than these. I've washed these 5 times already and they're still so stiff. The Merlot 500TC only results in thicker sheets but not softer. I haven't tried another brand and I had the impression that higher threadcount meant softer and smoother sheets. These do fit deep mattresses though which the Wamsuttas seem to have issues with. But my main priority is the feel of the sheets and these are a big disappointment.
4,WT,"Easy to use, and great speed on black and white print.Ink usage has been very satisfactory thus far. The cover should have a hinged stop to allow for partial opening of the cover without having to manually hold it."
5,"The perfect machine for slides, negatives and old pictures","I almost waited too long for this -- by the time I wanted to buy it, HP had discontinued it! Thank heaven Amazon had it; it does just what I want it to do -- prints from negatives and slides, scans, copies, faxes. It's perfect for working with photographic elements. I don't need large amounts of copies; I don't need to fax often. This is available for what I want to do with a minimum of fuss. I don't think there is another product out there that does just what this one does!"
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE - sorry if you already have one,Difficult to set up - I had to spend a total of 6(!) hours with tech support (entering ###.##.###.#.# ips) to get her up and running. After that the printer would keep getting dropped from our network so I had to keep restoring it to factory settings. After the third or fourth time with tech support I became adept at doing this without help. Two years and countless number of restores later it dropped off the network AGAIN. Couldn't restore it myself so used the online support only to have them tell me that it is an internal hardware error and I need to replace my printer. With as many problems I had I feel like I should have been told this from the get go. Should have returned it to begin with!!
3,Incorrect Specifications listed,"Amazon's list of color specifications is incorrect and indicates that it is a 4800 x 4800 dpi printer.Here is a cut and paste from HP's websiteUp to 4800 x 1200 optimized dpi color (when printing from a computer and 1200 input dpi)Nice resolution, but NOT 4800 x 4800 as listed at Amazon, all the other retailers have it correctly listed."
2,Not informative,"Sadly, this book isn't very good. I wish it were better, because I don't know of a book that discusses ""canyoneering"" that is good. I think Rock Climbing by Craig Luebben and Mountaineering - The Freedom of the Hills, both by the same publisher, provide more information relevant to canyoneering than this book, even though they cover many other subjects in depth. There was only one page of information that was new to me, the topics on this page: one-rope rappelling and retrieving webbing. I wanted more but didn't get it from this book."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","As far as management books go, this is not the worst but certainly not the best. However, if you're like me and don't have a choice because you're required to have this book for a class, it'll do the trick."
5,Jimmy Bruno: No Nonsense Jazz Guitar,"The title says it all...Jimmy Bruno presents his lessons in a very no nonsense type of way cutting away all the fluff. If your willing 2 do the work a easy 2 learn system is laid at your feet and u will understand, as simple as that...Jimmy if your reading this your the man...I'll be purchasing his other video lesson soon because this one has exceeded my expectation."
2,Communications skills,"The initial demonstration of guitar playing by Jimmy Bruno was very good.However It was not clear from the advertisement,that it was mainly a teaching tool.Mr.Bruno,is a horrendous teacher.He is much too complex,and assumes a lot of prior knowledge.He goes much too fast,and should have brief breaks during which the student is allowed to practice what he has just taught in the prior segment.It would be much better if he confined the entire D.V.D.to demonstration Jazz guitar playing,with a series of different melodies.It is fascinating just to watch a virtuoso,at any instrument, play"
1,Piece 'o cr@p!,"Why can't we give 0 stars? Worst timer ever! I should have paid attention to the other negative reviews, but since my previous West Bend timer was great and lasted over 20 years, I took a chance.It's almost impossible to hit the stop button without erasing the time elapsed. Flimsy; the magnet fell off after about a month--it was not hot-glued on, they just used something similar to rubber cement. As far as I know, it's never been dropped, yet the stand part that also holds the magnet broke off--not just came off, the tiny plastic pieces that hold it on broke off. Plus, the beep is extremely hard to hear unless you're only a few inches away."
1,timeless junk,The only way to turn this off is to remove the battery. Keeps terrible time--what a piece of junk! Please don't buy this thinking something new will work great--it doesn't!
2,"No off switch, weak magnet","I think the biggest thing missing from this is an off switch. But, if you don't mind burning through batteries or taking the battery out when you're done using it...then i guess it's okay.The magnet isn't very sturdy either.This was a disappointment because I like that you can type in the number."
3,Great for normal hearing capabilities but not for high-frequency hearing loss,"We use this as a ""time-out"" counter with our son and it works great for that--the numbers are large and the beep is loud enough for him to hear it well. It's not so great, however, for someone with high-frequency hearing loss, as all the person will hear is a faint click."
5,West Bend Digital Timer,This timer is exactly what I was looking for in a timer and stopwatch. It has big numbers and counts up or down. Very simple to use. Thank you!
3,The clip broke almost immediately,The timer is good and I like it for timing -- but one of the hinges on the back of the clip broke almost immediately and made the clip part unusable. I can still use the magnet on the refrigerator but cannot clip it on me to carry it away conveniently or use it to stand the timer at an easily readable angle. I'm very disappointed about that.
1,Terrible!,I had a timer similar to this for years. When it wore out I ordered this West Bend timer. It broke in less than a month. The digital numbers don't display correctly. I would not recommend this timer. Very disappointing!
2,Configure. Configure. Configure.,"I bought this to use at a business meeting where ""turns"" are 1 minute long. When you hit ""stop"" and ""reset"" it forgets what the timer was set to. When you hit ""stop"" then ""start"" again, it just continues from where it left off. It doesn't remember the time you last set it to -- so you have to type 100 again to time for another minute. I need a programmable timer that will remember several settings -- so I have to buy a different timer -- so that our business meetings aren't full of people trying to type 100 into the timer. I thought it would be nice to have 10 buttons on the timer -- but it wasn't the right timer for my purposes. Also, the magnet doesn't seem strong enough for the fridge, and it doesn't seem sturdy enough to take a fall."
1,Not worth it,"The food is Ok, but the 3 oz. cans are just too small to feed a multiple cat household. The cost of the shipping is ridiculous and they do tack on tax, makes this a ridiculous financial burden."
3,"Good, but no application","I like the devotional, but there doesn't seem to be good application to focus on throughout the day. So far, it seems rather surfacy."
3,"simple canvas type bag, nothing special","it's a good basic canvas type stick bag, it has a couple of plastic triangle shapped holers as wellas a couple strings to strap it up with. I have about 13 pairs in mine and it holds them and colses and thats all I wanted, a good way to carry them and a good way to get to them when needed. I will have to see how it lasts, but I think that the less it moves the better it will hold up, if it travels alot it may suffer a bit more, bu that is to be expected and for the money you geta good stick bag."
5,Careful research and hands-on experience are obvious.,"This is a book by someone who cares passionately that animals in general and the Russian Blue breed in particular are understood and well treated by their human companions. The 20+ years Ms. Urcia has spent breeding and studying these beautiful cats has resulted in an in-depth knowledge of her subject. She has put her knowledge to good use in her breeding methods and has kept this uncommon breed healthy and true to type. As the lucky ""owner"" of one of her cattery's Russian Blues, I marvel daily at his beauty, his intelligence, his energy and humor. Ms. Urcia's cats are lovingly hand-raised in her own house and result in the most well-adjusted, sweetest-tempered, happiest cats I have ever seen. She makes sure that her kittens go to loving homes where they are cared for properly. I wish all breeders of any animal were as knowledgeable, as careful and as ethical as she."
2,Some stories about a Corsair Squadron,I think I read this many years ago but I didn't remember that much about it. It is about one of the early navy squadrons equipped with the new Corsair in WW2. I was not too impressed with all of the back story and soap opera aspects of the first 3 quarters of the book. There is only about 50 pages devoted to actual combat tours and they are very thin reading. The first 100 pages is a fictionalized account of the forming of the squadron and way too much talk about nothing important. Would only recommend to die hard aviation buffs.
5,Outhouse poster,"I purchased this along with the shower curtain and rug to outfit my guest bathroom, and the comments have been fantastic. The only complaint I have is that the size of the print (5X7) was not indicated. I was able to locate a rustic wood frame which fit into the scheme perfectly. The shipping time was less than a week. Very pleased."
1,Arrived Broken,Fiesta Scarlet is a beautiful color and the Sugar and Creamer with Tray is really great. Mine arrived broken and I had difficulty returning it so I remain disappointed and unwilling to try again.
4,"Good Price, Wrong Color","They arrived, and are baby blue. Didn't see this listed anywhere on the listing. So, rather than jack around with returns, I decided to go the ghetto route and spray paint them. Worked pretty well, and now they are no longer the fugly blue color that stands out. Other than that, they work great."
5,Happy With This Product,"I had an old photo album that takes these refill pages for 3-ring 4x6 photos. I also bought another one from a thrift store. Being that they were so old I could not find the refill pages in stores anywhere. I tried Amazon and again I was able to find them, exactly what I was looking for and at a reasonable price. I bought 4 as shipping was only a little bit more for 4 as for 1. They fit perfectly and I am happy to have them. Amazon came through again!!!"
4,"A ""Y2K"" book for the common person: concise and pertinent.","The news is full of stories of Y2K and its potential impact on individuals, businesses and municipalities. The subject is complex enough that it is difficult for the common person to understand how to prepare for the potential problems. I have looked at a number of books on the subject and they are rather complex tomes that have little relevancy to individuals. Ms. Jan's book was perfect. It gave me easy to understand, easy to carry out ideas about preparing for a ""Y2K"" emergency. Additionally, preparation for ""Y2K"" is also preparation for a number of emergencies that could potentially impact everyone - including earthquakes or other natural disasters.My time is valuable and so I appreciate a book that ""cuts to the chase"", gives me straightforward, easy to follow instructions about Y2K or other potential emergency situations."
5,A sensual page turner...,"Camincha has her own beautiful style, and she's at her best in AS TIME GOES BY. She makes you smell, touch and feel what happens as young lovers immigrate from Peru to San Francisco in the 1950s. You are with them as they struggle with the newness of both America and their relationship. Snuggle up with this one as you head to bed, and you'll find yourself dreaming about this romantic South American tale."
5,A Beautiful set,"A lovely set, comprising of 2 cd's, dvd and book. The book is very simple, yet effective - gives ways of using reiki in achieving goals, enhancing creativity etc. It also covers the basics, which are always beneficial to revisit from time to time. The guided meditations on one of the cd's are effective as well. William Lee Rand is a true gem, and has contributed so much to the world of reiki"
3,"Great info , but misleading",I found the information to be complete and accurate for Reiki. I do wish they would change the information on the description to not be so misleading. You must get an attument before you can put any of this information into pratice. I would not have purchased this since you get all the same information in class.
4,Great watch,Simply watch but is exactly what I was looking for.Would have been happier with a regular leather band instead of a water resistant leather band. But not a big deal.
4,Timex Men's T46681,Great everyday watch for the price that is comfortable and stylish. Really like the indiglo feature. The only reason I am not giving five stars is the pieces of leather that hold the watchband down once it is on are not well made and stretch out to much.
3,Reprint - 1996,It's a cute story - thought it sounded familiar. Dug a bit here on Amazon and found I'd read it the first time around when it was a LoveSpell Faerie Tale Romance. I'm glad they reprint. I'm not glad when that fact is hidden. Available in paper for as low as .42 ---
1,Robbery,"For $6.95 I get this:RIP OFF!HONJI SUIJAKUThe term honji suijaku (literally, ""the original ground and its traces"") refers to a particular interpretation of the interaction between Buddhism and Japanese local cults. The term was used in medieval Japan to mean that Indian and Buddhist divinities constituted the ""original ground"" (honji) of their Japanese manifestations as local kami, defined as ""traces"" (suijaku).See also: Shint' (Honji Suijaku) and BuddhismBibliographyTeeuwen, Mark, and Rambelli, Fabio, eds.

3,Not Durable,"Makes very tasty coffee and keeps it's flavor much longer than the old style glass caraffe and burner. However, after 15 months use, it started leaking hot coffee all over the counter top"
5,Love it!,"I've had this item for a few days now and I love it. It is very easy to use, makes a great cup of coffee, it stays hot for a long time without giving the coffee that burnt/stale taste, very easy to clean, and dispenses the coffee easily and cleanly. I highly recommend this Brewstation."
4,Office Coffee Pot,"In an effort to cut costs, we got rid of our coffee service. I went online to select a coffee pot to meet our needs. This pot has worked well for us. It keeps the coffee hot for several hours without getting a burned taste. It dispenses well and is easy to clean and set up. A bonus is that travel mugs or tall cups fit just fine for dispensing."
3,"Good tools, bad carrying case","Tools are good, but the carrying case is awful. Latchs on the case won't stay closed so you can't carry it by the handle. The white cover is thin and looks cheap; it gets dirty and scratches easily. Since I was buying pink/purple women's tools, I was expecting a cute and durable carrying case as well."
1,Not Funny.,"I love almost anything Monty Python, so I was thrilled when this version of The Life of Brian came out. Especially after seeing the Eric Idle/John DuPre production of Spamalot. I knew going into this that it was an oratorio and therefore not theatricalized, but wow... never, I repeat NEVER send in an opera singer to do a comedic actors job!!! They do what they do and beautifully. But all humor is lost in this staid production. So sad. I hope that Mssrs. Idle and DuPre can find a more joyful expression of this brilliant original story."
3,"Fun, enjoyable read","I just finished listening to the audio version of this book. I found the story to be a quick, fun read. The writing was good and the characters interesting. The story was a bit predictable at times, but I enjoyed the break from what I normally read."
4,Watch,"This isn't the first Timex Expedition watch I have owned, but they are hard to find 'in' the stores anymore. Delivery was fast, and the watch is great, thank you"
1,Stay away,"I have to echo what most people are writing about this product. About six months ago I bought a used 30gb video ipod with very few blemishes. Now it has noticeable scuff marks around the click wheel and up the sides of the screen because of this ""protective"" jacket. Do not buy this thing."
5,Great Case ...Built to Last,"The DLO Action Jacket Ipod Case is a excellent product that will protect your ipod for a long time. I have had this case since I got my 5G ipod in 2005 and it never failed me...until a dog decided to chew it up in pieces.When this happened, I searched everywhere for a DLO replacement and finally got one for this old ipod.. I am very happy to say that if you are looking for a durable product...this case will not dissapoint you..."
1,Very disappointed,"I really liked the look of this case, but as others have said the stitching scratches your iPod around the click wheel. If anyone at DLO reads this, do yourself a favor and recall this awful product. It really turned me against your company and I'm betting that I'm not the only one.If you're like me and bought the case before reading the Amazon reviews (that'll teach me), the good news is that Applesauce iPod polish removed the scratches and restored the finish. Then throw away this case and buy yourself an iSkin."
1,ok...if you like your iPod to get scratched,This is a very poorly designed product. Everything about it is good except for the fact that the inside scratches your iPod. Definetly dont buy.
1,Conflicts with much in recent understanding,"For any author on nutrition to suggest that we start our day (and our metabolisms!) with little or nothing for breakfast automatically brings into question everything else in the book, unfortunately. The list of optimal foods per season is probably very good, but I was put off by the lack of metabolic common sense from the get-go."
5,A Holisitc Approach to Weight Loss,"I love this book! I have been searching for the right kind of ""diet"" plan for a long time and I found it in this book. Douillard offers a sane, healthy, Ayurvedic approach to eating in harmony with the seasonal energies that is simple to do and effective. I loved all the comparisons of different diets and the way he explains why they only work temporarily. Following this plan allows me to eat what my body intuitively hungers for through the seasons while showing me which foods to reduce or avoid to achieve maximum health. I definitely recommend it."
1,not impressed,"I will not buy this product again. The bread that results is not good. The flavor is off and I can't pin point what it is. I've tried playing around with it and adding things to make it better, but nothing seems to help. I honestly don't know what I'll do with my remaining boxes, because I hate to throw things away, I know no one in my hose will eat it, and I don't even want to donate them to a food kitchen cause I'd just feel bad."
3,It's white bread,"We purchased this for a new breadmaker we received since you can't really buy breadmaker mixes in stores anymore. The price is great, they come in a six-pack that is not all that large and we find it convenient to be able to just quickly make a loaf of bread without having to pull out the recipe book and add lots of ingredients. These make a 1 1/2 pound loaf if you're interested and it is pretty easy to make, just dump in the water, then the flour mix, some butter and the yeast...turn it on and wait! Overall, though, we found the taste to be pretty bland. There is nothing special about the bread from this mix at all, but they have other flavors that are much tastier in my opinion for about the same price. If you are looking for plain, white bread, then this will work out just fine."
3,Bread would not rise,"Out of the 6 boxes of bread, only 2 came out correctly; the other 4 were flat as if the yeast was no good. Of course being in Afghanistan with a bread maker, I could not just run out and buy some more yeast. Our experience was not good; they did love the bread that came out good."
5,Great tasting bread machine bread,The product arrived on time and there were no issues. We baked the bread in our bread machine at home and it made the whole house smell wonderful! The twins and the hubby ate the whole loaf within 48 hours. It was that good! You really can't beat the taste and quality of this bread. We are now receiving a monthly shipment to keep up with demand :)
4,"A bit commercial tasting, but ...","Processes well. Looks good out of the machine but is a bit Wonderbreadish (in my opinion).I favor a bit rougher bread with a more open crumb and with a more pronounced taste.I believe Krusteaze is a superior mix at least for what I'm looking for.I did add 3/4 cup of Oatmeal and an additional 3 Tbs of water to the ""Hodgson Mill WholesomeWhite Bread Mix"" and liked the results. Also used it to make some Pecan Rolls and again likedwhat happened.I made a mistake when placing my order and ended up with 12 sixteen ounce boxes so I'd bestdevelop a taste for this particular product."
5,Like a dream...,When I purchased this item I had been looking for something to make smaller loaves of bread since I had a zucchini bread recipe that overflowed in my traditional loaf pan. I used this the last time I made it and it works like a dream! I sprayed the area down with non-stick spray before putting in the zucchini bread and it popped right out with no breakage when it had finished cooking. Cleanup was so simple. I am now looking to buy more of this type of product (silicone with the sled).
2,Very confortable,This product is very comfortable. Yet very fragile. My wife put them on and they ran immediately.She is not happy.
2,"Had Good Potential, but has Fatal Flaw","This training DVD has many promising chapters introducing Garageband 09, with a good instructor and a motivated student,however the fatal flaw is that you cannot see the computer screen clearly on the video! Despite the fancy Mac monitor, it is very hard to see the details - how can you learn software with lots of features if you can't clearly see what's on the screen?Another comment is that, despite the enthusiasm of the musician learning the program, it may have been more efficient to have the experienced instructor doing the clicking to save time.Hopefully if they produce another training video for Garageband they will make sure that the computer screen is magnified adequately.The saving grace are the DVD-ROM clips which are in Quicktime and have slightly better image clarity."
5,West Bend Oval Slow Cooker,After 20 years of using my old West Bend Slow Cooker I asked my daughter for a new one for my Birthday. It's just as good if not better than my old one. The old one still works but it was a sight for sore eyes. I make grilled cheese on the mini grill part and slow cook roasts every week. If you like crock pots you will love this slow cooker. It cooks as good as it looks and lasts twice as long. I searched the stores and couldn't find one. Searched the web and found it. Of course she paid $49.99 at West Bend web site. So Amazon has a really good deal on this product.
5,Own it again!,"I had one of these long ago and ""had"" to update to a couple of different brands with just as much disappointment with ""new and improved"" as I was pleased with this oldie.I've found nothing that the lid is as well fitting, keeping moisture in, as this West Bend! Never again will I give my kids my West Bend! Let them buy their own.This, in my opinion, is much better than the traditional crock pot because of the different temperature settings. It makes it much more usable. I tried the grill on my old one and really decided at that time, though it was nice, it wasn't what I'd use for that purpose.Buy it, you'll love it!"
4,"Good, but liked my old one better.","I was looking for a crock pot that was a regular pan with a hot plate just like my previous one. I liked being able to brown meat on my stove first and then put it on the slow cooker. Also it was easy to clean, runs through the dishwasher just like any other pot. This slower cooker is good but has two drawbacks. There are no handles like my old one. It just has little metal grips which are hard to hold and get hot. I don't like the oblong shape because when I am browning meat in the pot on the stove there is a large portion of the hot burner exposed. I like this type of crock pot but I would advise looking for a round one with handles."
2,Slow Cooker,I am a little disappointed in the item. I have one purchased in 1992 and the new one does not cook as fast as the old one.
1,"Do NOT buy Viking CompactFlash ""-P"" memory cards","Do NOT buy Viking CompactFlash ""-P"" memory cards! They are more expensive and are the same exact product as their non-P memory cards. See below for an actual transcript of my question to Viking's online support center.I asked:Customer () 02/18/2004 07:14 AMWhat is the difference between the CompactFlash memory products CF128M and CF128M-P? What technical advantage does the CF128M-P card have over the CF128M? Thanks.They responded with:Response () 02/18/2004 07:45 AMThank you for using Viking online support. There is no difference between the CF128M & the CF128M-P. They are the same flash cards. The difference is how they are marketed/sold.Do not get ripped off!!! I've asked them this question once before and got the same response from a different customer service representative."
3,smaller than I thought,"It will work but I guess I wasn't carefull about reading the specs because it's much smaller than I thought -- the whole length handle and blade is 8"" long."
3,Lack of communication,Ordered the item and was on back order but no one contacted me to advise. Still have not received and was told it was shipped!
5,Cagney & Lacey: The Complete Series - 30th Anniversary,"My daughter had one wish for Christmas, she is a big Cagney & Lacey fan and she was thrilled with this....a bit expensive, but you can't put a price on love.. the complete series in one package, Can't beat that!"
3,Buy the Limited Edition from CagneyandLacey.com,"If you go to Cagney and Lacey dot com you can order the Limited Edition produced by Barney Rosenzweig. It is the entire series including all the Meg Foster episodes plus LOTS of extras not in this box set. It is also $40 cheaper! It is being distributed from Canada and is Region 1 USA. Mine arrived in less than 7 days to the USA! However, once the Limited Edition is gone, this 30th Anniversary set will be welcomed by many."
3,Made It Work,"It is a universal ignitor that required a little jerry-rigging for my char-Broil model. The installation wasn't difficult and I'm happy with the results. Can't beat the price, but depending on your grill configuration I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wasn't a DIY'er."
1,Sorry service,"My 12-year old son purchased this product using a gift card that he had from Christmas. When the product finally came in the mail, it was crushed and obviously not working. I've contacted the seller on three occasions and much to my dismay, there has been no effort to make this right. Even though the amount spent was small, I would have appreciated some effort on the sellers part to do the right thing and send another pen. We will never order anything from this seller again and I would strongly suggest using someone else if you're considering doing so. Very unreliable!!"
1,Never worked,"I ordered this item and when I received it, it didn't work. I called Cyberguys and they sent me another. Same thing, didn't work. I am getting refund now. Very disappointed. Was looking forward to pranking some co-workers."
3,Junk,Biggest piece of Junk I ever saw. Don't throw your money away like I did.I now know that this company does back their product. After my review they contacted me and are now refunding my product. So perhaps I just got a bad pen.this update is being posted 3-15-10
2,lasts maybe 3 days,"At first i was excited to have my own shock pen. I tricked my friends pretty good,but the batteries died after 3 days of use, and eventually the pen just fell apart."
5,Awesome A kid review.,This is great it is very good and it doesn't have a limit like those other shock gum it has a limit of 5 shocks. It is GREAT!!!
1,Broken In the Package,I opened up this gift for my boyfriend to find it BROKEN. Completely disappointed in the product. Do not waste your money. I will be calling tomorrow to get a refund.
3,pretty cool,It gives a good little chock maybe 5 volts it broke but I glued it still shocked the same its cool
3,Refills Needed,"The kit itself is great, unfortunately Verbatim has discontinued the refills. It's such a great product, it's a shame that once these labels are used, another kit must be purchased."
4,Emerson SmarSet Clock Radio,"This is a great little radio in many ways. It sets itself automatically when you plug it in & when Daylight Savings Time starts and ends. It has a battery back-up for power failures & the dial is big and easy to read. It has one quirky drawback. The radio dial will not go all the way to the low end of the dial. We have a station at 88.3 that the dial will not reach. I returned one & the same was true of the replacement radio. Otherwise, it is a great product."
1,Not so Smart!,"Was so excited to get this today. Just plugged it in and the date, time and day of the week is wrong. I'm in eastern time zone. It was suppose to automatically set to correct date, time, etc. today is 11/03 Saturday. It set for 03/15 1:00. I tried to change the time zone but the button does not work. Complete dud! Very disappointed!!!!"
1,No better then a sugar pill,"Waste of time and money, it may have the right ingredients, but you would need to take many of them to get any effect. Way to much money for such a weak product, anything above a one star must be from a placebo effect."
2,"""to fool the eye or to fool yourself?","""To trick the eye"" if that is your intention be objective ... this people do not"" fool the eye""... they fool themselves, and you."
2,Not what I expected,"Given the title The Art of Trompe L'oeil Murals, I thought this would be a more general, overarching book than it is. It is a collection of photos of the writer's portfolio of murals. They are done in rooms in which my entire house would fit, most often Palm Beach or some such moneyed locale. If you just want eye candy of a classical nature, this it. Otherwise, don't bother. Nothing to learn, really."
3,Were in the book is the fog chiller and glowing water??,The entire reason I bought this book was for the back ground projects glowing water and fog chiller. I read the book twice and did not see it in there. If anyone has found this please e-mail me. Other than that big disapoinment I found the book good. There are alot of good ideas. The writer leaves alot to your own imagination.
3,"Some good, some bad but worthwhile snapshot of FM","This pack contains 3 CDs - two studio CDs and a live performance from the early days of FM. Of the two studio CDs, Paraphernalia is pretty strong overall, with highlights such as Caught In The Innocence, the album shows Steve Overland's awesome voice and songwriting skills. I can't say the same for Aphrodisiac, which barring a couple of exceptions like Closer To Heaven, is pretty tedious and 90s-AOR-by-the-numbers.The part of this package that was worth the $ was the live CD - for those like me who lived in the Carolinas, seeing FM live was never really an option, so hear to a true live performance is really fun, even though a few of these songs are marred by Steve turning all the vocals over to the crowd. None of the arrangements of the songs is really that different from the Indiscreet or Tough It Out versions but still good stuff."
2,Something's Missing...,"I could go all out and say that this DVD sucks if it hadn't been for Arlen Roth's attempt to take the time to explain in detail the technique of vibrato (Most videos move right past learning the art of that technique). The rest of the guys act like they were dragged into the studio after an all nighter to run off a few licks for the cameras to complete the ""Blues Masters"" line-up. The Lonnie Mack section was ridiculously short. Although I enjoyed seeing lessons by the original blues artists in this video, I would have much rather had the entire video been taught by either Ronny, Duke, Buddy or especially Arlen alone. This DVD is only 30mins and I have found many more in-depth videos that run at least 60-90 minutes that delve much deeper into technique and offer many more examples for the price or less."
4,a very good one on this topic,"The first part gives basic patterns. However, I think the second part gives a more realistic picture of how to use it together with western technical methods."
5,Satisfied with the book,"Steve Nison is truely the father of Japanese Candlestick into the western. He explained why candles are made and how the candle can be a signal to get into a trade and when to get off. The convergence of East and West makes my trading more manageable and honestly, I have ""profit""-ed after reading this book. Very highly recommended!"
5,Graduate from Bar Charts,"If you have been doing Technical Analysis (TA) with purely Bar Charts, give Candlesticks a try. This book is the best book on the market (the 2001 edition). It covers the bases and gives good insights into the psychology (which is why TA is feasible). This will not replace ""Western"" TA, but is to be used in addition to it. However, candlesticks give you so much visual information, I guarantee you will switch your default view from bar charts to candlesticks. Read this book!"
3,not for all people,"The book is a good book, however it is not for all people. I have found it very difficult to get through. The subject matter I believe will lose most people. However certain sections in the book is quite interresting.If one likes translations and would like to learn more, or is studying the NWT in particularly, this is a great book, however the book is not for the avg reader."
3,A book on translation?,"If you are looking for a book on The Role of Theology and Bias in Bible Translation, (in my opinion) you won't find it here.This book is just a Jehovah's Witness apologetic. In the description of the author, it does not state that he is one of Jehovah's Witnesses.You are getting nowhere only that NWT and other bibels have their own agenda and if you read this book, you already know that."
5,One AWESOME Concert DVD ! ! !,"Hi ya'll Tarja fans, just wanna start off by saying I am a big Tarja fan since Tarja's beginnings with Nightwish and am still a Nightwish fan too. Got my DVD yeaterday at my local FYE store and watched Disc 1 this morning. This concert is amazing and watching Tarja perform brings back memories of her performance on the ""End Of An Era"" DVD. The sound and picture is perfect as you get the highest quality sound of DTS and picture perfect quality. The concert was shot perfectly as it was not made like an MTV video (camera moving everywhere, zooming in and out sporadically, ect...). So overall this is an awesome package put together. Highly recommended to everyone that loves this genre of metal!"
5,Interesting portrait of this artists life.,Fine illustration of the inner thoughts and ideas of one of my and America's favorite artist. Interesting and informative. Wish I could have sat down with him!
5,Incredible insight into the Wyeth Mystique,"I consider Andrew Wyeth to be one of the greatest American artists of all time and this book gives incredible insight into why. I have many books on Wyeth and this book is a ""must read"" to understanding this very complex man. WOW!"
4,"Great value, good product....","After pricing wheat gluten at my local grocery store, I ordered from amazon since I could get three times the gluten for the same price. I've been pleased with the product, but I don't know that I'll ever get through all of the boxes before they expire, I wished amazon offered a smaller quantity. Still an excellent value though."
5,THE ONLY TAROT BOOK YOU SHOULD USE,I AM THE OWNER OF A METAPHYSICAL BOOKSTORE AND IT IS THE ONLY BOOK ON TAROT I WILL RECOMMEND.
3,"useful, but basic","Kennedy's book is a great place to sart for anyone who is just starting to learn the mathematical techniques used in contemporary economics. If you are an undergraduate, this book will teach you most of what you need to know. If you are a graduate student, it will only get you started. It explains calculus in a way that is easy to understand. When I say that it explains calculus, I mean that it explains calculus so that you understand what it means, not just how to do it. The only shortcommings of this book are that it spends too much time doing Keynesian algebra and it ignores linear algebra comletely."
1,"When it works it is great,","however, in my opinion this is a VERY cheaply made product. Because of this it could easily fail when it is needed most. In fact, my kitchen flooded in the night 3 weeks after installing this product and the alarm never sounded. It had a new battery in it. Decide for yourself, but you are urged to find a different product."
3,They're ok,For the price they aren't bad. They are not very loud so maybe having all three next to each other will work better! Also I don't trust that they will float if the water reaches levels of that height. I taped the seem for in case.
5,Great help to us in Hurricane Irene,"These little meters are great!!! We are in New Jersey and have three of these in our basement. We have had them in the basement for about a year. Early Sunday morning, during Hurricane Irene, about 230 am, these meters beeped loudly and woke us up-----We ran to the basement and found that the water had just begun to enter. We flipped on the pumps, and got started drying out the basement long before Irene even hit the Jersey shore. These meters gave us a great opportunity to get the water out as it came in and before it could significantly damage our basement. I will always have these, and I think that they are absolutely wonderful products. We change the batteries in them when we change the clocks, just like we do for the smoke detectors. Great invention!"
2,Artistic but a big yawn,I'm just an ordinary person not a movie critic and I've seen the rave reviews on this movie but it didn't quite impress me. The movie is very artistically done and character portrayal is excellent but the scenes just dragged on that I actually fell asleep every now and then. I think it was too long for a movie that everyone already knows what the ending is. Even the title is too long. I've also never seen Jesse James portrayed as some kind of neurotic and that it is a surprise to me.
1,BOOOOORRRRRRIIIINNNNGGGGGG,"This has to be one of the worst, most boring movie I've ever seen. What a total waste of time."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"What more can you say. This one is terrible . So many got up during the movie and left. I should have but stayed hoping it would somehow redeem itself,it does not and is way too Long to be so Bad."
1,Don't waste your time or your money,This may be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Cannot understand why they bothered to make it. Do not waste your time on this one. Watching ants crawl is probably more exciting than the film.
1,very slow and boring movie,"i have never seen a movie as boring as this one,oh well i have seen one or two. i thought it's going be one of those nice western movies with action that you lose control of time, but instead it made the hour and half seems like the eternity to me and instead i kept on eating and eating & kept going back and forth to order food, it made me gain 5 pounds, it was a waist of my money and the money i spend on the food, it was a real shame, i give it one out 5 which is way more than it deserves."
2,Barely able to sit through this....,"After Gone Baby Gone, I was excited to see this film with Casey Affleck. Though he is convincing in this role, the film itself was barely watchable for me. I like subtle, dark films, and also high octane cinematic action flicks like ""Heat"", but the plot, scenary,and story arc were simply lacking for me. I didn't connect to these characters, and the movie felt like it was 10 hours-uff!"
2,"Too slow, too long","Jesse James deserves much better, Brad Pitt is a brilliant actor and even he struggles to bring life to this 'oh so slow' movie, Ridley Scott lifts scenes directly from Gladiator to no effect except to draw comparison with a great movie and fails miserably, with all the talent that this movie has to offer it still fails to move you and want to watch it again and again, this movie could kill off the whole genre on it's own."
2,Slow about as exciting as watching paint dry,Ok... First off I don't usually write reviews.The good: I agree with what a lot of the other posters wrote. It was a beautiful movie. The acting was ok... If you like long slow glares with few words...The Bad: Oh my god was this a slow movie. There was way to much time to enjoy the scenery and costumes. About half way through I was bored out of my mind. Then when I thought it was over (ok given the title I don't think this is much of a surprise but just in case spoiler alert) When they finally got around to killing Jessie James I wanted to cry. They dragged this scene out at least 10 minutes to long. But I was happy. I thought it was over... Then (spoiler alert #2) I found out the depths of my error... There was at least another 30-40 minutes of the movie... Yeash if it hadn't been for free and I was trying to fall asleep anyway I wouldn't have bothered.ps: The two stars is only because it was a pretty movie.
2,Lengthy docu-drama,"This movie would make an exceptional 45 minute docu-drama. It explores Jesse James, his killer's, and secondary characters' personalities and motivations. The acting is superb. Unfortunately, the story dragged on for 160 minutes with no new revelations or action to keep the story moving forward. The story shows Jesse as a heartless killer yet adoring father and how his paranoia drove him to kill his accessories. The movie also shows how Ford, who idolizes Jesse, ends up killing him and trying to cash in on his newly found fame, but there's only one problem and the movie gets to this point about 2 hours into it.The movie put my husband and daughter to sleep so that's why it gets such a low rating."
1,"So realistic, there are no likable characters...","The good - the cinematography is wonderful - the movie is beautiful to look at. Probably historically accurate, since the characters are dour, grim, ignorant, annoying and lacking in charm or charisma. Jesse James is described in the narrative as charismatic, but Pitt plays him as a cruel, paranoid, self-absorbed guy who works his mouth frequently as if he were wearing poorly fitting dentures. I'm a big Jeremy Renner, Paul Schneider, Sam Shepard, and Sam Rockwell fan - if these guys couldn't raise it out of the mire no one could. And mired it stayed for me - slow, dull, unredeemable. Quit halfway through."
1,Horrible version of a beloved story.,"In the early 1970's there was a made for television version of The Selfish Giant that was enchanting, touching and gorgeous in it's animation...THIS IS NOT IT! If you remember the original version then do not waste your money and time on this completely substandard version. The animation on South Park is a Disney film compaired to this crummy version, and the songs are terrible stinkers."
3,Not Really What I Needed,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This guide was a help to this newbie but essentially boils down to ""Where's the Beef?"" The spell listing was nice and the guide cleared up a few questions I had about how to get some things done but as a ""strategy"" guide it left me cold."

3,Good,"Good hat, just get in advance and hold in shape to get all wrinkles out and it will look great. Beard is loose fitting. Overall, gets the job done well"
1,authorial tone is disturbing,"I have been researching the story myself and am disturbed by the tone that Aphrodite lets seep into her narrative voice. At times, Jones lets the sentiments of characters like Nissen and Lotter seep into her own voice and her short and coded diatribe against the gay and lesbian acitivists who rallied together after Brandon's death does nothing to highlight the issue of what to call Brandon. Sorry, Aphrodite, it's about respect, not martyrdom. If you have any sort of allegiance to gay/lesbain/transgender causes and desire a greater understanding of transgender issues, then borrow this book if you must read it. Check it out from the library -- don't contribute money to someone who spends 317 pages without really trying to understand the dilemna really at the heart of this story."
2,I've read better articles in Parade magazine,"The book is terrible. Terribly written and terribly edited, not to mention horribly researched. The book's subject is a fascinating and compelling one, but Aphrodite Jones can't make it worth my time to finish more than a few pages without wanting to scream in frustration.I must admit that as an editor, I find countless typographical and grammatical errors in most of today's published works. But this book doesn't even seem to make an effort at being correct...one minute Teena's grandmother is called Francis, the next she's called Frances, the next she's called Francis again. Minor point, maybe, but still frustrating.The movie, while it takes some liberties with the story, is still way better than this piece of garbage. Spend the money renting the movie instead!"
1,Not happy with it,"My cupcakes broke while removing them. The sturdy wire sleigh holds the fussy little silicone piece well but I felt a need to set it on a cookie sheet rather than risk scrubbing a mess up later. I will not buy other silicone baking products, based on my experience with this one and this one will eventually go out in a yardsale."
2,"Not worth it, common sense information; not for MBA students","This book was a dissapointment for my whole MBA class. Definitely, if you have the slightest idea about how management works, this book will not bring you any new information. It is all based on a 3,000 people study.The author repeats the same ideas 2-5 times, so it becomes pretty boring. The examples are not something you can relate to.This book does not have any longevity, it is not something that you can go back and refer to, in a few months/years."
5,we like it so much,"We just started to get through this book and we already like it! It gives us so much fun and helps make better relationship between me and dogs. Completely new approach to the dog training, with a lot of humour! I'll send my comments again, when we'll finish this book."
5,understanding your dog,"My behaviorist/trainer suggested this book and I am happy that she did. I found the section on drives that dogs have to be very helpful. The drives are pack, prey, and defense -both fight and flight. The author explains that some tricks are easier for some dogs, given how much specific drives are needed to teach each trick. For example, two of my dogs just won't kiss my face, while two others can easily be taught the command for this trick. I didn't need the sections that focus on the very basics, the sit, down and stay - including using them for waiting at the door. Some people will find this section useful, other owners will have already mastered these commands.So only about half the book is spent on teaching cute tricks, but I liked how she explained them.This may not be the only book on tricks that I purchase, since I have one circus dog, but I am happy to have this one."
3,Red rocketing chair,"Don't get me wrong -- I think Mike Allred is a genius, and I'd follow his loony sensibility down just about any path he and his artistic imagination decide to take me. Somehow for me this whole 7-part epic (complete with accompanying movie and CD) just doesn't hold together -- the history-of-rock parts don't lend any real insight, the sci-fi story is too broken-up by the cerebral noodlings. I will say this: the art is stellar, and the colors -- thanks to Laura Allred -- are nothing short of gorgeous."
3,Ideas on what it is to be a man,"I purchased this book as I struggled with my manhood, after having read No More Mr. Nice Guy. I found the examples of the King (organizer), Warrior (aggressiveness), Magician (knowledge), and Lover (feeling) quite insightful. I understood I was lacking in Warrior part and the Lover part. I had a hard time though understanding the Lover part and how to improve. It was hard to take the new age parts in that section and apply it to my life.This book is more informative, and not as much self help. It is nice to read, but if you are struggling with masculinity issues, I'd recommend No More Mr. Nice Guy first, and then Way of the Superior Man."
2,high quality but VERY thin socks,"If your feet sweat a lot like mine do, these socks will be far to thin to provide the kind of absorbtion that you will need to keep your feet comfortable and dry. Stay away if your feet sweat a lot and find thicker, 100% cotton socks."
5,Monk Season three,DVD was in excellent condition. We enjoyed watching them shows. We received the DVDs very quickly too. Thank you.
2,Better Get Back Bitty Schram,"When this show first came out I really liked this show. Not since ""Columbo"" has TV given us a crime show without the blood & guts, sex & violence garbage and trying to masquerade it as ""realism."" Tony Shaloub is one talented man.However, since losing Bitty Schram, this show has lost its fire. Her replacement comes off like a shrill soccermom and she lacks the sexiness (and bootyliciousness I might add) that Shram brought to this show."
1,Are You Serious?,"Wow! I can't believe these people actually think this is a good movie. I am a proud owner of ""Walk Like a Man."" Not because I think it is a family friendly comedy, but because it is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie is so bad I want to show it to all of my friends. I was so sad when this movie didn't show up on any of the top 100 worst movies ever...I just don't think enough people have seen it. So please, purchase this movie so that it can get the recognition it truly deserves."
5,Early Clannad,"I am a big fan of the early Clannad albums (before the ""Theme from Harry's Game""). They had great character and marvelous sound, and I really prefer the acoustic and traditional instruments to the overproduced, synthesizer-ridden sound or the almost-U.S. style rock numbers on the later albums. If you like real Irish folk music, you should really enjoy this album. By the way, Enya is only on two of the Clannad albums, and only featured on one (not this one). The main singer for Clannad was Enya's sister."
4,Good unit to have,"This unit was a replacement for one that got damaged during use. (user's fault, not the product).Convenient product for short/long and easy dictations up to the memory limit. The PC version has the additional feature of using a PC to save your voice notes via USB connection. This is not voice recognition software so make sure you know the designed purpose of the software included with the product.Easy to use and navigate. Folders are quick to access, listen and erase."
1,not user friendly,"I bought this a while ago and really just began to use it recently. I had to call customer service because I was unable to get the basic folder function on the recorder to work. After some trouble shooting the rep while on the phone with me was able to get the recorder to move from file to file.I tried to record today in long play mode and only got about two minutes worth. I press the folder button and it will only display folder A.There's something wrong with this. The instructions are confusing and should be more simple. Pressing the folder button does not get into any other folders.I am very unhappy with this product, it doesn't work, and I bought all the accessories. I will admit that using it to record a telephone conversation was handy one time."
5,Outstanding,Purchased this for recording business meetings and am extremely pleased. Loaded the software on 2 computers with XP Pro with no problems unlike other posts have mentioned. Transferred 90 minute call (24 mb) in 4 minutes which is more than acceptable. The layout of the keys is very intuitive and the software for managing recordings is quite acceptable. Cannot imagine someone being unhappy with this unit.
1,Won't work in Windows Vista,"I bought a new computer with Windows Vista, and it won't install the USB link to the recorder. I called Olympus and they just said that it won't work with Vista. That is: it will NEVER be compatible (they won't issue drivers for Vista). That is: I have to buy a new recorder (bought this only last year). I'll make sure the new one is not an Olympus. (By the way, if you happen to lose the CD and need the drivers, they don't provide them online in their website). It's 2007, my friends, everything should be easier to install, especially USB devices."
1,cool,"its pretty sweet, I can record myself playin piano on low, and record a multi-hour story on high then just move it all to my laptop with a click of the mouse."
1,Terrible - Known problems,"This has a known problem if your system is Windows XP. It may work for one day and then stop working. Will get an error that says 'Device cannot start. Code 10'. Belkin will replace it without asking very many questions. If I could give this zero stars, that's what I would give it. Don't buy this."
1,Worked for 3 weeks before dying,"This hub functioned well [on my XP system] for about 3 weeks, before unexpectedly reporting a a Device failed to start 'Code 10' error, following a system reboot. I went through the XP the troubleshooting work-flow, but had no success at re-animating the beast. My recommendation would be to forego the economy, and spend a little more of your hard earned cash on something better. Fortunately, I was able to return my dead hub and receive a full refund."
1,Did NOT Work for Me,"I have a Windows 2000 machine with 1.1 ports and found no solution to getting this device to work. I kept getting a ""This device will not start. (Code 10)"" error. I am now assuming that it is not comaptible with 1.1 ports, although there was NO mention of that by the manufacturer."
5,"This is the best valerian,ive ever taken","super strong and works quickly.This is a great product and well worth the value....i mean honestly how much is a good night of sleep worth to you...Ive taken valerian for years ,and this is by far the best valeian product ive ever used...just remember its not about the taste..its about the sleep..Just a warning for parents this product is way to strong for your children...go with the melatonin...this is way to strong...i wake up and feel like a million bucks after using this product...i love it highly reccomended"
2,NOT worth the money,"I had this toy with my first daughter. She never liked playing with it! My friends spent so much on it, and it didn't entertain her at all... The mirror was the only thing that almost interested her, then she would usually get bored with that so quickly! She was immediately bored with all the other activities - couldn't make the animal sounds herself, didn't care much about the small water area (we had another larger water mat that cost $6 from walmart!!). I thought this would be such a cute, fun toy, but nope. I ended up giving it away to a friend when I was pregnant with my second daughter, and haven't regretted it for a minute! The only positive thing I can say about this toy is that it did look cute sitting out in the floor of her bedroom! I think it is more to attract parents with its look than entertain kids!"
2,Disappointed,"I find this toy very disappointing. There is not enough for my son to do while he sits in front6 of this toy. It is not very stimulating. He used to crinkle the sun around the mirror, but after a month or two the sun lost its crinkle. I find the toys very hard to squeeze in order to get noise out of them. It is just a boring toy, and is not worth the price. The colors on muy toy ran when I hand washed it. Although, now I believe they use better dyes."
2,Glad I didn't spend the money on it,"We received this from a friend whose son was done playing with it. Our son was about 2 months old at the time, however we waited to put it out till he was 6 months old. It keeps him occupied for a little while, but he quickly becomes bored with it and starts trying to pull it all apart. He likes the pond the best, which happens to be the biggest pain of this toy. It is hard to fill, even harder to empty and impossible to dry out so we're always worried about mold! It is alright, but I wouldn't recommend paying the price for it in the stores..."
2,Not as fun as it looks,"Unfortunately, this toy is not as much fun as it appears to be. We bought it for my daughter when she was 3mo as a toy that she would enjoy later. I am still waiting for that day. The fish pond sprang a leak within two months of use and so we are unable to use it now. Also, each time one of the velcro shapes is pulled off the toy, it causes the entire mat to be lifted off the ground and causing it to twist and bend. She had more fun taking the toys and sticking them to the berber carpet and pulling it back off than playing with the ""discover lane."" I definitely would not recommend this product."
3,"Good toy, but not $40 good","I bid on this toy on Ebay ($13), it definitely isn't worth $40. My daughter enjoys it, and she will roll from one end to the other playing with the different parts. She eats the velcro pieces, and plays with the water filled part. Mine has not leaked yet. The animals quit making sounds very quickly. Only one of mine still works. She gets her foot caught under it a lot too, it is too light. She can lift the pieces up. I would not recommend buying this new, but if you can get it cheaper it's pretty good. The Tiny Love Gymini is worth every penny, and lasts a long time!"
2,Not as comfortable as they look...for me anyway...,"I love Easy Spirit shoes, but I was dissapointed with this, and I'm glad I didn't purchase more than 1 pair. The front of the shoe cut into my feet. I'm hoping that it will stretch enough so that I won't have to suffer!!"
5,Incredibly comfortable!,"These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn. They are so soft and flexible, it almost feels like you aren't even wearing underwear. I plan on purchasing more of this item."
5,Costs less - works great,"What can I say? I bought this 256MB secure digital card to expand the tiny 32MB memory on our digital camera. It was much cheaper than those I found at the local stores. It works great. I just plugged it into the camera slot and my camera can now take hundreds of pictures. No more running out of ""film"" and no more deleting shots because the camera's memory is full."
2,Carafe for Krups,"I looked up the carafe for my Krups 2 cup coffee maker, but the filter unit does not sit on the carafe squarely. It is slightly too large. We use it but not sure if a properly sized carafe is available."
3,Price Jumped From 7.99 to 9.15 in 3 Months,"These are a quick, albeit already more expensive way, to get a check on pool & spa. However, the company raised the price from 7.99 on July 26, 2012 to 9.15 on Nov. 1, 2012. I find that insulting in an economic environment where inflation is at only 2% - 3%/year maximum. This is an astounding 14.5% in 3 months!! I was just getting ready to buy more.Copy of prior order info:Leisure Time 45010 Chlorine Test Strips, 50 CountSold by: Amazon.com LLCOrder Placed:July 26, 2012View Order Details | View Invoice* Order Number ************ Recipient: ********* Order Total: $7.99"
5,great transaction,"Product arrived on time and in condition promised. This order was just a refill, so nothing to report other than being happy with the quick transaction."
2,Why is this priced so high at Amazon?,"Why, oh why, is Amazon selling this for $99 when most retailers (Walmart, et.c) carry it for about $40? Am I missing something? It's only the deluxe versions of this simple model that run above $60...."
5,Held her attention,After bringing my daughter home and she was no longer on the bili blanket. She would not lie on her back for very long without fussing. Then I put her on this playmat one day and guess what? She laid on it for the longest time staring at the toys above her. She is just about 4 months now and loves this toy. I don't understand it but it is great for her.
3,upgrade,"i originally had the 5 in 1 boppy gym, but after learning you couldnt wash the boppy i returned it for this one and a separate boppy. the colors are great for the newborn, but ive seen several others i wish i had bought, for the same amount or slightly more money."
3,Not for the Active Baby,"My child has never been interested in this color combination. The toy she enjoy most on this gym, the mirror toy, she outgrew in 3 weeks. The musical toy is difficult to operate. My daughter has been turning over since she was 3 months, so by the time she could grab the overhead toys, 4 months, she prefered to be on her stomach crawling. This mat is too small to crawl on. If your child is active and doesn't like to lie on her back or is an early crawler get something else like the 1-2-3 Discovery Lane."
3,Okay,"It kept the babies attention for a little while, but it wasn't the best toy to buy because it was expensive and the colors were dull. My mother would have been better off buying something else!"
4,"By far, the most used item I recieved!","My daughter has used this playmat almost every day since she was about two weeks old. She just loves it. Of course now that she is 7 months old, she rolls off of it pretty quickly, but I never thought it would even last this long! It travels well, and goes right into the washer. I gave it 4 stars because the toys that come with it are not very exciting, but there are a lot of accessories that can be purchased seperately. My daughter is especially fond of the octopus, ladybug, and chimes. For us it was well worth the money!"
5,Need this for the early months,"We have twins and bought 2 different activity mats and this one was great. We were able to put different toys on the cross bars and change the visual keeping the babies interested. They learned very quickly how to reach and grasp at what they wanted and I was able to have them entertained (and learning about their world) for a short time without having to hold them continually. Having twins meant one had to be put down often in order to take care of a need with the other and this toy was a must for keeping them happy while doing that. While the colorful mats caught my interest, the babies loved this black, white, and red model the best. I used this until 9-10 months old when they started to ""toddle"" around."
2,Great for a while (!!!) . . . but becomes a bore.,"For the first few months after my baby brother was born, he loved to look at the red, black, and white colors. Soon enough he could hit the hanging toys and kick and bite at the (as he thought) interesting material. But after a while, the song didn't make him laugh as much and the toys became a bore to hit. He still plays on it, don't get my wrong, but I have to put other toys on the mat to keep him occupied. I'll put him on his stomach sometimes and let him try to comprehend what is going on in the television, but that is about all he likes to do now. I don't think I'd recomend this toy to anyone just because after awhile, children get sick of it."
3,Very average,"I got this as a gift and it has been okay. My daughter is now 5 months and she is getting a little bored with it. The good thing about it is that you can buy extra toys to hang from it and you can hang them as high or low as you want. For the first 4 months she loved it and would stare at the hanging toys for hours, but now it keeps her entertained for only a short period of time. The mat is great for the baby to take naps on and washes well. It also folds up and I can tuck it away in a small space which makes it great to travel with."
5,This is the one essential item for all infants!,"I had one of these for my son who just turned 4 and it was the BEST present I had received. We used it all the time - at home, travelling, parties. It is the gift I love to give all new parents. When I got pregnant with my daughter I went to my son's old toys and dug out his. Even though it had worn well (it's great that you can wash the mat) it had gotten ruined in our basement :{ So, I bought a new one and my daughter is having just as much fun as my son!"
3,great idea but...,"I was given this as a shower gift. It's a good product, but my daughter could only look at it for a short time. She was more entertained with her Looney Tunes mobile and the chandeliers. She stopped being interested with it at around four months. She still uses the toys, esp. the links. But once she started rolling over, a regular mat is roomier for her. It also fades easily and harder to wash the material for the dome."
4,"Great gym, but not too ""special""","My house is crawling with baby gear (PNP, gym, swing, jumperoo, etc) and I love this gym thats been around for my 3 year old, 16 month old, and 4 month old.PROS- It fits in the bassinet portion of our PNP- Theres a lot of room for the baby to roll around and play.- The colors are great for a developing baby, and its very soft.- There are a few toys on the cross bar, but you can also attach and I can interchange them with my own link toys- The gymni is very easy to clean- I can pack in in a small duffle bag for travel- I love that the Gymni has a few musical toys as wellCONS- It would be great if the mat could be reversed to a more colorful side- It could transform into another toy for another stageAll in all its a great gym, one that I have used for 3 kids, but I would reccomend owning something else as well, thats more stimulating or bright (or a bouncer or something) Highly reccomended"
3,NOT SO GREAT,"I PURCHASED THIS WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS 4 MONTHS OLD SO MAYBE I WAITED TOO LATE. SHE HAD NO INTEREST IN LAYING ON IT AT ALL. THE TOYS ARE NOT VERY INTERESTING AND THERE ARE ONLY THREE OF THEM ANYWAY. ONCE SHE COULD SIT UP THE ARCH IS TOO LOW FOR HER TO SIT ON IT AND HAVE ANY FUN. OVERALL, I THINK IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE BABY WHO DOES NOT LIKE TO STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG."
3,book on clocks,Wasn't clear that this book really concentrates on European made clocks and not the USA- I was disappointed as it won't help in any of my research. My clocks were made in CT
5,Next to a sports car this is a real drivers must have,"If you are a true racing fanatic this is the wheel to have. It works great on GT4 and works great on my PC with other racing games. While it does lack a true shift gate and pattern, the nice heavy rubber grip of the wheel makes up for it. The force feedback works well but is a little noisy. This wheel gets 5 stars as I don't think there is anything else out there that can compete as of this writing.I only hope the next one will have a shift gate and a clutch :)"
5,Can't get any better than this!,"This is the best wheel for your money. If your game is compatible with 900 degree steering your gaming experience will be awesome. And even if your racing game is only compatible for 200 degree steering you will still enjoy playing with this wheel. You can feel every bump, every crash, you will even feel the wheel start to tremble when you go over 210mph. You have to do no calibrating, the wheel does it by itself when you turn on the PS2. All you need is a little coffee table or something similar where the wheel can clamp to. The gas and brake pedals are very realistic and comfortable, and they come with strip of velcro-like hooks at the bottom so they don't slip.As a racing fan, I can tell you that there is no way this could be better."
5,Almost perfect,"Everyone from customers to news outlets like IGN and GameSpot have praised the Logitech Driving Force Pro, and even though I figured its expensive ticket price would probably merit its worth, I was skeptical. I just got it yesterday and it's awesome. No more fiddling with analog knobs to make those tight corners.But the wheel, in my opinion, does have some weak points I wish Logitech could've worked on:* Wheel size: It's kinda small. For an adult, it feels like I'm driving a go-cart.* Gearshifter: Small and hardly moves. I wish it had more movement so I could distinguish between shifting up or down. The clicking sound is too small, too. You're not gonna get too much fun out of shifting on this wheel, that's for sure.The positive points far outweigh these minor detractions, though. I haven't tried other wheels, but I can't imagine getting better control over your car in GT4."
2,Don't expect too much,"This little book is amusing enough, but my husband found it sexist. It lacks much in the way of real information, and it assumes all guys love watching football. If you're looking for the *one* best read for fathers-to-be, buy Armin Brott's The Expectant Father instead. Go ahead and get this one too if you're just looking for a little comic relief -- but I'd rather borrow it from a friend than spend money on it."
5,As a WOMAN this was the best pregnancy book I read!,"Thank you James Barron for such an insightful view of pregnancy. As a woman this was the best book I read. It is clever and witty while being realistic and informative. It is the one book that I handed my husband and said, ""Read this and memorize it!!"" It is something that I love to refer back to and I constantly will say to my husband, ""I think you need to check page... again."" I can't recommend this book strongly enough. Enjoy and be sure to tell a friend about it!"
2,Cheesy,"My husband told me he thinks this book is more cheesy than informative. I haven't read it myself, but he was not impressed."
3,You Gotta Love You Some Fagen,"Kamikiriad almost turned me away when I opened the CD case and read the ""plot"" of the CD, about a guy who recieves some ""super car"" for his birthday. A little hokey, so disregard it and just listen to the songs. The first song is a good introduction, and kind of sets the leisurly jazzy tone for the album. But there are a few suprises like the upbeat ""Florida Room"" , and the oh so clever ""Tommorows Girls"".The real prize of the album though, is the 7 minute ""On The Dunes"", which has your attention at first note and keeps it all the way through its nostalgic musings of things gone."
2,A Muddle,"Illich is faced with a problem. He deplores modern civilization as dehumanizing but recognizes only subsstence existence as an alternative. Unfortunately subsistence existence and other historically based cultures prensent strongly based sex roles. This flies in the face of feminism which denies the value of culurally defined sex roles and thus denies the values of Illich's ideal culture. Since feminism is a powerful political force, Illich must find a way to make his views compatible with it.Illich overcomes this by defining modern sexual roles as sexist but historical cultural roles as gendered This is the book. He overcomes the challenge to his ideal by a linguistic definition. His history of social roles is spotty and biased to prove his point.The book is a sophistic muddle. Mnay many better books that the social history of the home are available."
5,A wonderful first book,"Linn Ullmann's debut shows us her talent in describing a disfunctional family (that you will later familiarize, I bet), with such updated originality, but without being vulgar.Meet Karin Bloom and her family. And discover your own family. No family is perfect. This one isn't ,neither is yours."
2,Two stars for effort,"I read about a third of it and then quit. I couldn't keep track of the characters or what was even going on. Ullman wanted to give us a character portrayal, but what she gave us was a jumbled mess. I would imagine that if she wasn't the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullman, this book never would have made if off of the slush pile!"
5,Lifts you up !!!!,"It just makes me very happy watching this DVD. Okay, so we learn that Don and Walt are not perfect and neither are the rest of the bandmembers or the editor or the cameraman, but the whole package is just so entertaining and the music sounds so great (in surround 5.1) as a whole that it makes me swing in my chair every time I listen to it. And that for a guitarplayer who is nicknamed ""the Sphinx"". I also like the interviews in between songs and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't get it.Most of the ""old songs"" are played with more groove then ever. especially ""Black Friday"" and ""Green Earrings"".Again; Wathing this DVD and listening to its music just lifts me up !!"
3,"20 years later, not much has changed","The lyrical themes in 'Two Against Nature' are the same as 'Gaucho' twenty years ago: lust, appetite, age, consequences. If anything the Dans have turned their renowned cynicism on themselves. Or so it would seem from listening to the two best songs on the new album, 'What a Shame about me' and 'West of Hollywood'. It's not a thorough-going cynicism because the lyrics accept pain and loss. As for the music, it's the same electronic piano based light funk with occasional horns and a guitar player. Walter Becker is the guitar player on all tracks and he's pleasant but not as incisive as some of his 70's work. Nor is he as flamboyant as Larry Carlton often was on the old records. There's very little swing here and the tunes aren't very strong. But it's nice to hear an intelligent lyric and the Dans are resourceful and clever as ever."
4,Great Concert...Edit the Chit Chat!,"Awesome show...intimate setting...just copy this one to SVHS, and edit out the interview segments! Makes for a far more enjoyable experience ( at least the songs are complete, which is more than I can say for certain other DVD concerts )."
2,The Emperors Have No Clothes,All the wishful thinking (or listening) can't disguise the fact that this is not a very good CD. The songs sound like rejects from Kamakiriad and Walter Becker's repetitive guitar riffs just can't carry a CD by themselves.
2,It wasn't there.,"This CD was so cold I needed to put on 'Can't Buy a Thrill' to warm up. I really wanted to go on Amazon.com and write a great review, but then after listening to the CD on a long road trip, I can safely say that it is not good. I was really anticipating the arrival of the next Steely Dan recording, however, this was a major disappointment, especially because their ""sound"" was so distinct and sincerely sleazy (the way I like it). To be constructively critical, there is no warmth whatsoever. Put Aja on and then put this on. You can totally tell a difference in the recording - both stylistic and in the audio. Very dry and too digital. I'm sorry, guys."
2,SD Fan,"Making an album is alot of hard work, yada, yada, yada. Long time since they recorded, yada, yada, yada. Kamakiriad Two, please don't tell me it's not, yada, yada, yada. Becker's ""11 Tracks of Whack"" was much more interesting/enjoyable/innovative, yada, yada, yada. Did I buy it? Sure. I'm a SD Fan, man."
2,"Shimmering, uninvolving piffle","The detached coolness, sophistication, and introspection of ""Aja,"" ""Katy Lied,"" and ""Pretzel Logic"" are supplanted by jokey lyrics set to purposefully (needlessly?) labyrinthine melodies with high-school stage band-caliber horn charts. Those who swoon that the songs of ""TAN"" represent the ""natural evolution"" of Steely Dan have very low standards/expectations indeed, and would probably eagerly purchase ""Steely Dan Sings the Best of Fatboy Slim"" with the same abandonment of their critical faculties. Becker + Fagen are ideally positioned, as middle-aged men, to produce music that is genuinely reflective of the ennui and angst that was presaged by ""Aja."" Instead, ""TAN"" is a massive betrayal of unique talents. The result is endlessly disappointing, uninvolving, shimmery-gorgeous piffle."
4,LOCAL BOYZ,......Glad to see the local boys can still shine the silver bowl......What took you so long? This is a great comeback CD and needs another one real soon to keep the momentum going .... I dragged out my collection and listened all over again and realized how great these guys are ...my memory machine was in overload. The two standouts are Jack of Speed & Shame About Me........Donald and Walter please keep shining the bowl!
2,What the heck is Becker doing?,"I am a bass player who used to play in a Steely Dan cover band. The SD's older work offered me and the rest of the band quite a challenge. Their sound, quirky harmonies, rythmical changes and their general sophistication were very hard to copy. They also had quite a great line-up of guitar and bass playersNot so on this album. Becker's bass and guitar chores are bland. The guitar is repetitive and lacks depth and refinement. Becker's bass work is better, but also here there is too much repetition and lack of inspiration. I found it very disappointing that I could actually play most of the songs on this album in one go, whereas on previous albums the songs often offered me quite a puzzle.Furthermore, this is a Fagen album... and not even his best. The Nightfly and Kamakiriad were much better. So yes, I am disappointed. There is no material on here that I would like to cover."
5,Outstanding!,Had the worst seats @ Irvine Meadows and could not see them! This wasa great way to solve that problem! And what a deal... These guyshave been a mystery to me over the years. They are pretty reclusive. You really get to know them and appreciate what oustanding musicians they are. The band they put together shines and the backup singers are babes with great voices.Perfect selection of songs too. One negative is the innane chatter on the couch when the two are talking with other members of the band. Scrape that please or fast forward through it! So if you missed the live show no worries! You saved a ton of money and the video takes care of that. Enjoy!
4,"Maybe no Pretzel Logic, but very good.","Some Steely Dan fans have expressed disappointment with this new release, but I can't see why. It's as good as almost any of their earlier albums and better than some (particularly the last two.) Musically there are no real changes from the seventies except for an increase in funk; in that respect it could be said to continue a trend started in Gaucho 20-odd years ago. ""Cousin Dupree"" and ""Janie Runaway"" are as good as anything they did in their heyday, as far as I can see. The strange thing is that Two Against Nature makes it seem as if they've hardly been away rather than taking an extended hiatus through most of the 80's and 90's. I look forward to their next album in 2020."
2,Steely Dan Does It Again (Ho Hum),"The good news is here's another Steely Dan album. The bad news is it's another Steely Dan album. If you're a diehard Dan fan then you'll like whatever they churn out. After so many albums, though, the music is becoming formulaic and predictable. The lyrics are still bizarre as ever, but the rythms and oddball harmonies are just warmed over. There's no excitement on this album, as in My Old School, Bodhisattva, Between the Raindrops, or any number of old Dan and Fagen tunes."
2,Better on CD than DVD,"Steely Dan sounds great on CD but is boring to watch on DVD as there is not much stage presence. I will stick to their CD's which are great and not any DVD's. They also omited their best songs like: School, Rikki..This one is not a keeper."
1,Tried and tried (tired and tired too),"I listened about once a month for four or five months, trying to GET what won this album a Grammy. Can't listen no more. I'll keep to the vintage Steely Dan and to Donald Fagans more recent efforts."
2,"Oh my, is it just me?","I really had high expectations for this album, and I really wanted to like it. After a listen to the full disk, all I can say is if McDonalds made music, this is what it would sound like.The trademark Steely Dan sound is certainly there, and the performances and production are top notch. But to me, these are just throwaways, filler tracks that have little passion or adventure, and probably wouldn't even make it on an earlier album.I guess it's true that all good things eventually come to an end. RIP Steely Dan."
4,Steely Dan defies the nature of time.,"The passage of time is not always kind to our favorite artists as long-awaited releases often disappoint. We program our cd players to play the 3 or 4 ""listenable"" tracks as we reach into our collection for our favorites when the artists were in their prime. After nearly two decades of no Steely Dan, it's great to hear a strong release from a ""group"" that hasn't missed a step during their absence. ""Two Against Nature"" can stand proudly among Steely Dan's best work.It's all here in this jazz/funk/rock delight! The signature stylings of Fagan's vocals/keyboards, Becker's guitar bits, the jazz brass/woodwind arrangements/solos/breaks and the sometimes elusive lyric meanings that make one think.This could have easily been released in the 70's and their sound would have fit right in yet it stands as a great piece of work today nearly 20 years later. Such is the timeless nature of Steely Dan that will win new fans, and thoroughly delight old fans as well!"
4,This record must have been in the can,"ALL these years, because Steely Dan has barely lost any of the charm it had in its heyday. Its a comeback on the order of the Grateful Dead's ""In The Dark"" or Jethro Tull's ""Crest Of A Knave"", or heck, even Aerosmith's ""Permanent Vacation"". I mention these three because they were monstrously succesful and very good when the bands werent expected to do anything at all except flog a dead horse. About every other song on this record is worthy to stand next to any of their greatest material. All the songs average about 5 to 6 minutes, so when they misfire, it's torturous, but what a beautiful world it is that we have the remote and the CD player, just like Fagen said about twenty years ago in ""IGY"". I love that these guys could wake up from a long sleep like theirs and whoop the pants off of any other rock band without even trying.."
2,Thumbs down from a Dan fan,"I'm a big Steely Dan fan with all but the Pretzel Logic CD in my collection, as well as Fagen's solo efforts. ""Two Against Nature"" has been thrown into my ""rarely listen to"" bin. Maybe it'll grow on me, but I don't think so. In my humble opinion, this is their worst effort and the fact that this is their only Grammy winner is the biggest insult. Yank that Grammy away and give it to ""Gaucho"" or ""Aja"", where it rightly belongs. In conversation with a friend, I mentioned that I was disappointed with ""Nature"". She used much harsher words ... While I only own the 2-channel CD, the music content is the key for me, so no multi-channel magic could pull this rabbit out of the hat."
1,"Poor, Pathetic, Pitiful","As a long time fan of Steely Dan, I pre-ordered this way before it was out, excited that they were finally releasing another album.Unfortunately, I ended up with 2 copies of this dreadful CD. Perhaps one song is tolerable. The rest stink (putting it mildly). If I could I'd give this less than 1 star.Don't waste your money. But if you must I'll send you 2 copies for free."
2,Don't be fooled by the overpraise.,"Those who claim that true Steely Dan fans will consider this among the group's best efforts are seriously deluded. I have all of their material and have considered myself a big fan of these guys for more than 20 years. This is their weakest effort by far. I've had this in the turntable now for two months and still can't get into it. If you are new to the group, consider Royal Scam, Aja or Countdown... first."
1,Don't bother,"All songs are very homogeneous and forgettable. Not one stands out. I bought this when it first came out 10 years ago and recently stumbled upon it in a drawer and wondered why I didn't have any of the songs on my iPod. (I have always been a huge Dan fan) After I chucked it in my cdrom drive and started listening to it again, I was reminded why this cd ended up where it did."
4,Trading Up in a down turn economy?,"I have used TU for two years in my Enterprise class for freshmen at our business school. The book is very popular (especially Victoria's Secret and Callaway Golf)with my students. I wish the authors would update the book again with more explanation of TU during hard economic times as well as adding a chapter on the impact of the Internet on trading up. I think the key point of TU is that the middle market (undifferentiated products and service) is being replaced by premium companies ""trading down"" and discounters ""trading up"". This theme should be more explicit in the next edition. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on services in the trading up phenomenon, since were heading toward a service economy in the US. I would also add more on the phenomenon through the eyes of global consumers and companies. Overall, I plan to use the book again next semester, along with complementary case studies from HBR."
5,Excellent product,This chicken base is far more better and tastier than the chicken stock in a can. It really adds great flavor with just a teaspoon full of the base. I highly recommend this product.
4,for WoW,"Got this pad for World of Warcraft. Takes a good 4-5 days to get used to it. However, I was never able to experience the full power of my rogue until I got this pad.The only thing I didn't like in it is the actual navigation keys that you can see on the right. Instead, I used them for finisher movers which worked very well. For navigation I kept the layout similar to the wasd on the pad.Anyway, I quit wow now, but for those who are considering for wow, I do recommend it. Good luck."
2,Doesn't live up to its predecessor...,"I have used the N50 for almost 4 years now. I thought the n52 would be a step up... more buttons have to be better right? Unfortunately that isn't the case. The D-pad was EXTREMELY sluggish and unresponsive compared to the n50. I finally had enough of the n52 and replaced it with my n50. Things are good again. I really lived having more buttons, too bad Nostromo couldn't follow through with the quality they had for the n50."
1,What a useless watch,I bought this watch for my son as a Christmas gift this year. It worked for about three weeks and stopped for no reason. Amazon replaced it with another. This version lasted 64 days and then stopped working again for no reason. I hope that Amazon accepts it and refunds me. I remember buying Timexes when I was young and they were durable. Unfortunately the brand has really deteriorated. Too bad.
1,A piece of junk,"The watch arrived today. Although it looked exactly like the picture, and appeared to be brand new, it would not run, nor would the face light up. The battery must have been exhausted. In addition, the bezel was frozen and could not be turned. Considering the positive reviews of this item, I must have received a real clunker, but, you only get one chance, and the hassle of returning the item and waiting for a refund means that I'll not buy from this manufacturer again. As it looks brand new, I'll bet that someone attempts to resell it, so be careful."
4,Sinatra Concert Collection,"Well, I finally received the Sinatra Concert Collection DVD set.Being a Sinatra fan since the Pal Joey movie days of the late 1950s, I already had most of the concerts on VHS. And, I was in the audience at London's Royal Festival Hall gig, which was the first of twelve live concerts in which I saw Sinatra over the years.I am glad to have the boxed set, but a little dissapointed that the tapes were not cleaned and re-mastered better. As it is they are the same as the original VHS tapes. Maybe one day they will be re-issued totally re-mastered.However, not withstanding the quality, for anyone who did not see the original tapes or the TV shows, this boxed set is essential to have, an amazing record of Mr Sinatra's work both on television and in the concert hall.Larry RichmondLondon, UKFebruary 2011"
1,Not pleased.,"The unit ordered did not fit my Visor Handheld unit. I offered to pay for all shipping costs (to and from my location) to return unit to seller. Seller preferred to make a statement that they did not ""misrepresent"" the product sold, and as a result would not accept a return. I never stated that the seller misrepresented anything,... I merely wanted to return an unused unit which I could not use. Seller refused, and shared with me their personal buying errors that they have accepted and lived with as ""learning experiences."" If sellers would be understanding, these learning experiences would be minimized in the marketplace, don't you think!"
5,"Love it! Love the taste, easy to make in bread maker","Love it! Love the taste, easy to make in bread maker! Will be a favorite of mine from now on."
1,Pilgrim,"I ordered 2 CDs and received them in a flimsy envelope. One of the cases was broken and actually looks like the Cd is damaged inside as I could tell by looking. I tried to find out how to return the ruined CD but the company never responded to my request for more information.I am very dissatisfied with this company, and would like my money back somehow."
1,Hardly a Book,I thought this was a book - a simple book for children to read. It is just a bunch of words...one word per page and picture...boring! Just get a dictionary because $10 for this is crazy!
1,Only a few good images...,"Although this book contains a few great images (the Library, the Escalator, the Grave), the price of the book is definitely not worth it. I had seen Mutter's images on posters, and figured the rest of his images in this book would be just as intriguing. I was wrong. Most of his images in this book have little artistic value, and seem like cheap photographic gimics. Save yourself the money and just look at his posters. If you see one you like, buy it--don't waste your money on this book. If you're looking for an exceptional photomontage book with tons of great images, check out Photo Synthesis by the original photomontage master, Jerry N. Uelsmann."
4,Good speakers for web surfing.,"If you're a gaming nut, these speakers are likely a bit too weak. But, for surfing the 'net and listening to MP3's, etc. at a modest volume, these economical speakers work great."
3,Missing screws,"NIce looking, high quality but there are no screws to assemble. My plumber did not have them either. Grohe support diid not help."
5,a jazz explosion like no other,the cd is an energetic jazz explosion that won't let you stay in your seat.
1,DON'T Buy this toy!!,"I was very excited when I saw this toy, my boy LOVES Blue, this toy however was a real let down. You can't see the drawings or anything on the screen. Overall this toy SUCKS."
1,1 star is too many,"This book was a requirement for class, and one that the whole class (including the instructor) found to be a waste of time. It is VERY unorganized, and the questions at the end of each chapter are misleading. I read chapter 10 at least 5 times, and still couldn't answer most of the questions. Luckily when I got to class I realized that no one else could either. Hopefully in the future the professor will look into another book that promotes learning."
4,This is a very easy to understand book,"This book doesn't contain any logic gate level designs but covers general computer organisation issues thoroughly. It is only 670 pages approximately and covers instruction set design, CPU structure (ALU + control unit), I/O (such as SCSI, FireWire and RAID), Bus systems (PCI, Futurebus+) and operating systems etc. There are numerous comparisons made between Intel Pentium and PowerPC. It is a good book to start with a very good bibliography for more detailed books on each chapter's subject."
3,Good book,I thought this book was a pretty good text book. The reading was fairly easy. The layout is good. It has good references and examples. I had to have it for my class but I did read a lot of it.
2,Too wordy,"Why make it easy for the reader and come to the point? The authors of this book just use too many words. It is a waste of time to read all this blah, blah, blah. The concepts are easy in themselves."
3,Starts off well and then gets static,"The book does indeed start off with a bang, telling the story of a coal mine explosion through the eyes of a 5 year old boy. that boy grows to be the books narrarator who has returned to his Pennsylvania mining community to chase his demons.The author does a nice job early on to develop an attachment to Ivan, the narrarator and his sister as well. She also begins to delve into the dynamics of the small town but then its almost like she gives up and goes the easy route of telling the story as simply and quickly as possible. By the end, I was left questioning the characters motivations, annoyed by the clean and simple ending and wondering if the first half of the book was written by the same person."
4,2nd West Bend Slow cooker I've bought,"I have this same brand oblong slow cooker,but a smaller size, that I bought a long time ago. We camp, so I keep it in the trailer. I wanted one for the house, so I bought this larger version. I LOVE the carrying bag that came with this one. I didn't have the bag for the smaller one.One thing I have discovered--the silverstone finish to prevent sticking, does not seem to be as thick as on the older one. I have used this 5 quart slow cooker only two times, stirring with a nylon spoon, and the bottom of the pot is already showing light spots.I have hand washed it and followed the directions very carefully."
5,REO- Raw Entertaining Original;,"I was so glad that they remastered REO / TWO I think it's their best, and I am so glad that the first album was included , Although Terry""s Vocals were okay (strange how he went from this band to the mock Yes ""Star castle"") I would rather hear him sing over Mike Murphy anytime. These songs are underrated and the musicianship is fantastic. But there is no mistake that Kevin Was the right choice for a front man, I really hope that riding the storm out is remastered and rereleased with the original Cronin tracks, They were repalced but not erased."
4,Great CD,"My first concert ever was Joe Walsh with opening act REO Speedwagon in 1974. I had been a fan of REO for a couple years before that concert. I have seen them many times since then and still listen to their music to this day. REO II is one of my favorite all time rock albums and I have owned it on CD for many years now. I have searched the internet high and low looking for their first album but never have been able to find it on cd. Until now that is. The release of this 2 album/cd is long overdue. Even though I have owned REO II for sometime, I still purchased this cd since it is the only way I know of to get that rare REO debut album in cd format. All the songs are there and it sounded great on my home and car systems. I highly recommend this double cd combo pack since in my opinion REO II is the best REO album ever and as a bonus you get the rare first album on cd. WIN,WIN BABY!"
3,Nice concept but not all bras are the same,"I purchased this bra extender with 3 hooks. The 3 extenders are much larger than the bra that I have. So, it works using 2 hooks, but that's it. Delivery took a long time."
2,By Royal Mail???,"I did not see any info that this item is coming from overseas until I checked on why it would take so long. Initially shipping said Sept. 8-16, now it says Sept. 16. Why would I pay for EXPEDITED shipping if it was going to come via ROYAL MAIL and arrive after it was needed?!This is not the first time important & VITAL info has not been easily found, if present at all.Shipping through AMAZON is not STAAIGHT FORWARD!"
2,Califone 3068AV Switchable Stereo/Mono Headphones,"Just as some other reviewers said, these are way too tight. There is no way to adjust them not to be tight. The coil will pull your computer before it stretches, and I am afraid to pre-stretch for fear of it snapping because it is so stiff. The volume control is just awful. There is a switch on each ear and turning the volume down on one side will move that volume to the other ear, rather than actually turning it down in both ears. To turn down the volume, you have to turn both knobs simultaneously. Finally, I get fuzzy sounds sometimes depending on how I turn the headphones after first use, which will only exacerbate as time goes on.Final review: Not recommended."
5,headphones for me,"I was looking for a simple inexpensive set of headphones for computer, portable dvd, and iPad use. Being a retired educator the name Califone rang a bell. Not only do memories of school pop into my brain when I use them.... but they fit well and sound good enough for my use."
2,"It works, but the drive is SLOOOOOOW!","8GB Ep Memory Mini Flash Drive USB 2.0 performs more like an old USB 1.0. Files that unzip in seconds in other drives now take minutes. Defraginging the drive with just 200MB has gone from 5 to 10 seconds in other drives to 5 to 10 minutes. I am happy with the greater storage capacity, however I would not have purchased this drive if I had known how slow it is."
5,"This book is small, but packs a big punch.","In this book, you will get concentrated doses of animation rules and laws as it applies to timing. Very simple explanations, tricks of the trade, formulas, and vital do's and dont's is what seperates this book from the rest. In animation, it's all about the timing."
2,Poor quality,"I'm a fan of the Yardbirds, but this is the type of disappointing junk that eMusic has to offer through its on-line service. Varies from okay to very poor quality - bass notes fuzzing, live recordings (made from the club's bathroom?) and whatnot. Only for the crazy Yardbird fan who has no regard for their own ears. Two stars given since it may have some historical value for completists, and the fact that they make ""Smoke Stack Lightning"" sound like ""How Many More Times"" by Led Zep."
5,Nice Jazz CD,"I'm not a Jazz expert or even listen to Jazz music much. However, I do enjoy listening to this instrumental Jazz CD."
5,This library can change behavior,"As an HR manager, I've been attending Bob Nelson seminars and buying his books for years. These books are full of highly practical, actionable advice that, if followed, can literally change the behavior of talented but sullen employees who often simply don't get the validation they need from their managers. Research shows that employees don't leave their jobs, they leave their managers--and in this climate we can't afford for that to happen. I will also recommend Beverly Kaye's excellent book ""Love 'Em or Lose 'Em"" as another great tool for retaining your best and nurturing your brightest."
3,misses the purpose & yet is ok,"I thought I was buying a external amp for an mp3 player. The amp feature is likely the weakest part of this product. The case is very sturdy, comes with a carabiner clip, nice sturdy zipper, volume control works fine and overall useful size.The amp is not as powerful as I expected; I get almost the same volume from unpowered speakers plugged directly into the mp3 player. Plan on using it in a area with low ambient noise; even a car requires both the player & amp almost maxed out to hear; in a newer quiet car.Since I have a number of interruptions and am listening to podcasts I often need to pause the player. To have access to the player I rubber banded it to the outside of the case while I was using it. I also keep leaving the amp on because the indicator light is on the inside and I forget it when I pause the player.I have found a use that works for me and will keep using the case & amp however it was overall disappointing purchase."
5,Really goes everywhere!,"Wow! This little light weight jewel goes everywhere with me, and fits all of my i-pods. As I paint, it hangs on a hook on the easel, but has found itself wandering off with friends to sit in the yard. It's not a real volume producer, but plenty loud enough for small gatherings. It seems to be rather frugal on batteries as well, which is a plus (unless it is left on over-night, since there is no glaring light to remind one to turn it off once the ipod has been removed). I would be lost without it because of it's small size!"
1,"Amazon sent me two, both were defective","I purchased one and it arrived faulty. It was intermittent and most of the time power wasn't working. So Amazon sent me another (Amazon returns are amazing by the way) and the second one didn't work at all! Amazon are not going to try and replace a third time and instead refund me... shame, looked like a nice package."
2,Bill Butler,"Caution: ""POL"" means reverse threads (left-hand threads) this will only fit the older generation of protable LP gas tanks, not the typical gas grill tank of the last 10 years or so. I did not realize this and the description did not mention this, only ""POL type"", so I had to return it for the modern day type."
1,Wrong item description,The item description on the website is Fram CA9361 Extra Guard Rigid Panel Air - 2 pack. I was expecting 2 pcs of this filter type but only got one! It was supposed to say 2X the performance.
2,live?,"this album,while decent in vocal performance,is a ""fake"" live album! there are no liner notes. there is no crowd! it is as ""live as it gets""!"
1,the temptations live as it gets,"The cd is a recording of the 3 leads of the Temps. Eddie, Dennis and David when they reformed in the late 80's and early90's so that why it sound so different the only voice that sounds good is Dennis Edwards. there have been about 3 releases of this U.K. cd. one is the original leads of the temps and this one and I forget the other one. It is not live at all and i paid [money] dollars and never have felt so ripped off.BUYER BEWARE IT STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Very little music,Most of the dvd is Kenny and crew talking and getting ready for the tour. Not a concert type of dvd. More like a documentary about the concert.
5,Milau Viaduct,"If you are interested in Bridges and engineering in general, this is a must see DVD.The way they constructed this bridge really pushed the engineering ""envelope.""The final result is not only an amazing engineering feat; but one of the most aesthetically designed bridges I've ever seen. It blends in perfectly with its environment; no easy task since the bridge (i.e., viaduct) spans an incredibly beautiful valley. To all the men and women who had anything to do with the project, well done!"
5,NIGHT'S LIGHT,"CD IS AWESOME, IN A WORD. DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW OTHER REVIEWER DOES NOT LIKE CD(WHICH ANYONE IS ENTITLED TO FEEL) BUT TO SAY OTHERS WERE PAID TO SAY IS PLAIN STUPID, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS CD. PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY, ITS AN AWE INSPIRING AMERICAN MUSIC CD. MAY NOT BE WELL APPRECIATED IN A LAND IN CONSTANT STRIFE. LIKE MY TITLE WOULD INDICATE, ESPECIALLY LOVE ""NIGHTLIGHTS"" AND ""VISION OF THE NIGHT"". DENIS PLAYS ALL INSTRUMENTS AND IT BLENDS LIKE A STRAWBERRY SMOOTHIE. SWEET AND SWEET!! CAN NOT WAIT FOR NEXT CD RELEASE."
1,"Bad product, bad customer service","I ran out of my Method cleaner, and picked up a bottle of this stuff in a pinch at CVS. It worked fine the first or second time, but then it left cloudy sticky residue on my floors and I'm still trying to figure out how to take it off. I did use this product on a laminate floor, which apparently is not the same as a hardwood floor. I'm not sure how much it matters, given the volume of complaints on the internet.Google 'orange glo residue' and you'll find a slew of hits about how awful this product is. People are even making money selling eBooks for $5-$10 on how to remove this stuff! I'm considering taking this further -- so far, customer service is standing by the line that I misused the product and it is my fault."
1,ORANGE GLO IS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT DON'T USE IT.....,"The finish started popping off my pre-finished floors....I don't know what caused it, but Columbia Hardware floors are blaming orange glo hardwood floor cleaner...and they are voiding my warranty because I used this product....Don't use this product!!! Is anyone else having this problem with the finish popping off? The floors are less then a year old....I'm thinking about getting in attorney....I would love to know if someone else is having this problem...contact me at moonrat@homesc.com...Rhonda"
5,Used for Years and Love It,"I've used Orange Glo on my real hardwood floors, they are not Laminate, for about 4 years now and I absolutely love it. My floor isn't heavily urethaned, so the Orange Glo soaks in nicely. It does have a learning curve to getting it just right, as you can only mop a very small section at a time and use a very small amount of Orange Glo at a time and you cannot let the Orange Glo dry on the floor. Otherwise, when using a damp mop along with the previous tips, I have a beautiful shiny floor every time. In fact, I bought some Libman hardwood floor cleaner, and I hated it. I had to run out and buy more Orange Glo to cover the Libman mess."
2,Disappointed,I am a beginner and really want to know more about what makes a good picture under various conditions. I felt this book fell short in explaining the technical details of aperture and shutter speed correlation. The section on lenses was very brief and general. Am I missing something about learning photography?
2,"Work well, but has odd odor","I first saw these goblets at a formal dinner and loved them. They really keep drinks super cold, and they look great. But I ordered one for myself and it has a really odd odor whenever I put liquid in it. Don't know why. Ended up sending it back."
3,Great smoker box,"This cast iron smoker box is a good product for the price. After use, my smoker box started to corrode/rust slightly, but this was mostly my fault and does not impact overall performance of the box. One annoyance I had with the product was the label that the manufacture puts on the face of the product with industrial strength glue/adhesive. It was very difficult to remove."
5,Adapter works great.,I purchased two of the LP hose adapters and they both work very well. They will pay for themselves just by not having to purchase the small propane canisters that cost about $2.50 each and would only last for one cookout. I have two portable bbq grills that I use at home and when camping. No tools required for installation.
5,Can change your outlook on life,"This book can change your outlook on life if you will let it. It is a wonderful book full of stories and examples that will help you understand how you can be a better person. Some related books that are produced by people or companies associated with Terry Warner:1. The Peacemaker: this book preaches the same philosophy but bases the learning on scriptures and the atonement of Christ - excellent read, highly recommended.2. Leadership and Self-Deception by the Arbinger Institute: Same story format as the Peacemaker but from a business perspective.All are great reads, but Bonds That Make Us Free is the masterpiece.Other books that have changed my life:The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck - great insights on how to improve yourselfApproaching Zion by Hugh Nibley - a classic that will have you questioning modern society's basic premises."
5,"Tough, But Worth It","I struggled through the first 100 pages of this book. Not because it was difficult to read or understand, but it was difficult to look at myself the way the author suggests. Like struggling through a narrow entrance to an underground grotto, the struggle was worth it. Warner's book presents a tough pill to swallow: Most of our problems with relationships can be improved if we will only look to see how we are poisoning the relationship. The major premise is that when we are disappointed in our actions, we often will then modify our perceptions in order to make us feel better.Get through those first 100 pages with a lot of self-reflection and you will then find tools to improve your relationships. These are not things that you must convince OTHERS to do. These are tools to help you poison less and heal more."
4,Heavy but Good Book,"Thorough and somewhat scholarly. First part is depressing, but prepares you for the second half which is uplifting and liberating. ""The Peace Maker"" by the same company is a better and more accessible introduction to the concepts."
5,Profound,"I found Bonds That Set Us Free somewhat difficult to read and understand, but it was definitely worth it. A section in the book called 'Listening to a Face' describes how the quality of our (close) relationships improves when we stop trying to influence or direct the responses of our loved ones. Rather we need to let ourselves by influenced by their needs.I gave it a try. It wasn't easy for me to put this into practice - and I'm still improving - but almost immediately my relationship with my wife and kids improved. And the improvement was palpable - my interactions with my wife, and son in particular, softened and became warmer.I'm grateful Terry Warner wrote this book and thankful I read it."
5,"""Bonds That Make us Free"" by C. Terry Warner","This book teaches that the self any of us doubts, feels ashamed of or guilty about is not who we really are, but a fear-driven phantasm - and the destruction that self doubt causes may leave one feeling hopeless. Bonds That Make us Free helps in overriding discouragement. Falsely created images about ourselves can be overriden by truth. Very helpful in discovering who we really are."
5,should be required reading in schools,"This book changed my life. Read it and it will change yours for the better. I bought into the 90s victim syndrome. Only made my life miserable. This book turned me around to face my own stuff. I now know that as soon as I start blaming and feeling offended, I have created my own misery. This book should be required reading in high schools. Very well written. Very important. Buy several copies and give to your friends and family."
5,Life changing!,"Terry Warner goes to the core of how to heal broken relationships and enrich true relationships.When our relationships are true, we are free to love deeper than ever before: no more manipulations, no more selfish half-truths, no more escalating cycles of hate...The message is simple: be true to yourself and others. You know deep down what is true. And when you are true to yourself, you are freed from destructive cycles of deception. You are free to give to others without strings attached.His examples bring this message to life. They are simple, true stories from real people who discovered how they were deceiving themselves and who then learned how to be true to themselves and others.This book shows how to break free from destructive cycles. It teaches how to heal relationships. It reveals how to see things as they really are.This book has changed my life. I have personally seen it repair marriages, heal families, and save friendships."
4,Stylus,"This is a great product. It works well with both my handspring and paper. Makes writing so much easier. True, it is kind of expensive for a pen, but it makes things so convenient."
4,I like it.,"It comes in real handy to have a pen that will write on normal paper and use as a stylus. It also saves me space to have only one pen. Refills in my area,though, are hard to find."
4,Fluke AC285 Clips,"The Fluke AC285 Clips are great heavy duty alligator clips, just one thing wrong the Fluke AC285 Clips, only work on Fluke Leads as I've got a WaveTek meter and needed replacement alligator clips I bought the Fluke AC285 Clips hoping it would work on my WaveTek Leads, but No Luck"
3,"A good read, but not for academic purposes","This book is a collection of other writers' personal feelings towards Tolkien's work (mostly The Hobbit and LOTR). While reading it, I had the feeling that the editor asked all these writers the same questions (when they first read the Hobbit or LOTR, how these books influenced them as readers and writers, etc.), who in turn produced articles of a somewhat personal nature. It is an entertaining book, but if you are looking for meaty lit. crit. on Tolkien, you won't find it here."
2,"Really, ""Geroge""","The Kindle edition of this book is rife with typos. The first author's name is presented as ""Geroge R. R. Martin."" Every other instance spells the plural of 'hero' as 'heros.' 'Ores' instead of 'orcs.' I bought the thing to have a little wallow in some things I love, so I have no real complaints about the content, but it's hard to read a book with this many errors."
3,Weakest of ITIL series,"This ITIL guide is the weakest of the series because the approach is outmoded with respect to contemporary development life cycles. The chapters address the following key areas and follow the older waterfall SDLC:(1) Requirements(2) Design(3) Build(4) Deploy(5) Operate(6) OptimizeThe latter three milestones - deploy, operate and optimize - spill over into service management covered in the Service Delivery and Service Support guides in the series. In that respect this guide does provide a comprehensive picture of applications delivery, and service and support delivery.If you are pursuing ITIL certification you will need this guide, despite the shortcomings I noted because the material will be part of the exams. However, if you are only exploring ITIL as a viable framework for your organization I would bypass this book unless/until you decided to actually implement ITIL and/or pursue certification."
3,Difficult for Patient Losing Strength in Hands and Arms,Rubber bands are difficult for children or elderly to manipulate. I would suggest an elastic stretchy band of some sort.
4,Very good toy,"We are happy with this toy, but we sought that it will come with colorful instructions and design cards and more rubberbands."
3,Women's Rashguard,"While I like the product, it was not the same product that was advertised in the picture. My rashguard was all blue with blue stiching. The picture showed a rashguard that was blue with white stiching. The picture should be corrected. I would have preferred to receive the exact item that was advertised."
1,Used one time!,"I bought this for my three year old grandson. It was used only one day because it had a small hole in it. It was nice while it lasted, but it wasn't worth the money."
5,Danger and romance in Cornwall,"The plot is fast paced, with secrets, smugglers, danger and intrigue, but also laced with humour - creating a wonderful balance and rewarding read.Corie is a fiery local girl and daughter of the vicar. She dedicates her life to helping those less fortunate than herself. She is passionate about her cause, fearless when faced with danger and hot tempered.Donovan appears to be yet another London rake, but he is anything but that. His depth is slowly revealed as the story progresses and Corie grudgingly has to admit to herself that her assumptions are not that accurate.Their `business' marriage crackles with tension and there are also some very amusing scenes.Several events in the background are deadly serious and they face grave dangers from known and unknown enemies."
1,Horrible heroine!,"Corisande is so very unlikeable and she doesn't deserve Donovan. She's supposedly very selfless and caring, but for such a bloody saint, she's effing annoying. He couldn't say a word without her interrupting him and thinking the worst of him. Romance wasn't believable. I was hoping Donovan would go through with the annulment and find himself a more loving wife!"
3,"Good story, but too descriptive sex scenes","I enjoyed this story. It had intrigue as well as romance. My main complaint with most novels lately is the sex. It used to be that a Regency romance was a clean and fun read. Now, it is hard to find one without some level of explicit sex. This wasn't as bad as some, but certainly not clean. I really think that smut detracts from a book and cheapens it. Authors should trust that people would read a book for the storyline and not for the trashy talk."
3,Mystery was boring,The book started out ok but then it had too much going on. Then it dragged on for too long and I almost lost interest in it. It could have been much better but alas it was free.
2,OK for kids 10 and up!,"I purchased this book to prepare my 5 year old grandson for the play, The Great American Mousical, which we would soon be seeing. While the story line is cute, I found the language somewhat stilted,dated, and cliched. I would have preferred a few more drawings to break up the dialogue. My son ended up paraphrasing many of the pages as he read to my grandson who was a bit confused by all the characters. (My grandson loves books and is very familiar with chapter books. He enjoys discussing characters's motives.) He enjoys books on CD, but I doubt even an audio version of this story would be enjoyable for someone his age."
5,Great basic vibration analysis book,"This book covers all ranges of structural vibrations in buildings, from machine foundations to external wind loadings. The book is clearly rewritten and not extremely technical, but provides additional sources for more technical requirements. The book also presents ideas for remediation of various types of structural vibrations for existing structures.I highly recommend this book for both beginning and experienced structural engineers."
3,So-so,"This was a little smaller than I expected and my four year old son claims the fact that it's too easy as the reason he doesn't play with it much. His pediatrician's office has a huge one and he plays with it like mad when we are there, so I figured he'd be thrilled to have his own. He has a mild interest in this one in a while, but not much. I'm going to move it to the car and hope it gets more use there."
5,3 year old loves these,Volume is loud enough for our 3 yo to use in the car and on the plane but not so loud to damage his hearing. The tigers are a nice touch to get them to wear them the first few times until they get the concept and are ok with having something on their ears.
1,Headphones,"We received the wrong product on this one. Ordered the tiger headphones and received the plain red ones. Decided it wasn't worth returning as my daughter needed headphones. Additionally, we have had those just shy of two months and they are already not working properly."
3,Flimsy,"Sound quality is good. But flimsy...The volume control area was open and the chip inside exposed. It was too much bother to return, so put a tape around it. The wire broke within 2 months of occasional use."
4,Excellent Navigation Software for PDA,"I used Navigator 5 for a couple of years and now have used Navigator 6 since it first came out. Navigation and routing are very good. It runs well on an iPAQ 2215 even though TomTom doesn't list it as supported. I use it with a GlobalSat BT-338 BlueTooth GPS receiver. My only complaints are that the POI database lists only the name of the POI making it difficult to determine which Holiday Inn, for example I am looking at. Also, linking it to the BT-338 was a bit tricky since it needs to be configured not as a BlueTooth GPS receiver, but as a wired GPS receiver connected to COM8 (a BlueTooth serial port). I highly recommend it as a PDA navigation solution."
1,Don't Buy It,Map Share IS NOT included in this software. The software consistently routes an incorrect (much longer) route near my home. Customer support says it's a map error (on a 30 year old MAIN ROAD) No map share = no fix. Dissatisfied.No returns on open software. No help offered on customer support.
1,"High Hopes, Poor Product","With very limited device support, little or no customer support, and a premium price, Tom-Tom blew an opportunity to change how consumers view hybrid GPS units.Perhaps, the competition will learn from this and provide the tool we are all looking for."
4,"""Club Paradise"" Better than they wanted it to be?","I remember the first time I saw Club Paradise and thought then as well as now that it was a very funny movie. Yet for some reason the critics, if you can call them that, like to slam a movie because it apparently doesn't fit into what they, in all their limited wisdom, think is funny. It may not have been the funniest movie I have ever seen, but there were several gags and clever one-liners by Robin Williams (who is the master of the one-liner) as well as the rest of the cast not to mention some great music and beautiful scenery. I guess it's like beauty being in the eye of the beholder, one's man's trash is another man's treasure. As far as I'm concerned, most of these critics don't know Adam from Eve. A Big Thumbs Up to Robin and the rest of the folks that made this very enjoyable movie possible."
5,couldnt find this movie ANYWHERE,Found it here though.. thanks for having movies like this from the 80s thats hard to find. I look forward to buying more
4,I lived the life of Club Paradise!,"This movie is right on the money in capturing the ""island life""! ALthough I did not meet any angry mobs or true rebels, I certainly did meet the slimy ""club"" guys from the big city, the nerdy first time vacation girls, the slick reporters and ""old boy"" British governor types(Usually with big yachts!)and not to mention the rich men who were always boring! I love this movie, because it brings back great memories of being a club owner's girlfriend! I was right there! A light hearted movie with some very funny moments! Eugene Levy and Rick Moranis are perfect!"
3,Fun,"This is a thin, episodic film, that, if you don't like fluff, you won't like this. But I don't mind sleight films, inherently, so enjoyed this, because the jokes are often clever, the performances generally fine ones...Robin Williams, as usual, is really awkward and not very watchable, but that is more than made up for by Peter O'Toole, who brings his usual charisma and wit to the screen (he's the best thing in the movie). Jimmy Cliff is suprisingly good considering his day job is as a reggae singer. Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis are good as the two dorks who are desperate for girls. After seeing this film, I wanted to book a flight to Club Paradise myself!"
4,"Base Ball Shirt, Baltimore Orioles Sleeveless Top",Baseball Shirt - Baltimore Orioles Juniors Pink Sleeveless TopCute Fashionable Baseball shirt. Pink Sleeveless Raglan for a good Price. A must have for all Orioles Fans.
5,This is great.,"This is a good job. (unlike the hackjob they did on ""Thats the Way it Is""I am so mad about TTWII ....I cant even review this....but the quality is good and its nice to see it on DVD"
5,This video brought Elvis' story to life.,I saw this video for the first time last year. I have to say I enjoyed getting to see Elvis' story seem to come to life. The saddest part is of course right before he died.
3,THIS IS ELVIS,For a casual fan this is probably ok. For a true fan there is nothing here that you haven't seen or heard before.
1,what a mess,"Well, I'm all for easy clean-up & new technology but this one just didn't work for me. Let me say that I do own the muffin pan - which I love. This pan is another story. I thought the cake was done but when I took it out of the pan, it was not. I even used the tried & true toothpick method to insure the doneness (?) of the cake. Also, removing the cake from the pan is definitely a two-person task. I tried going it alone & wound up with the cake in many, many pieces. It would be impossible to get this cake into the oven if it were not on a cookie sheet or something similiar. At least the muffin pan offers a sled to aid you."
3,Not that funny,"Carl Hiaase and Ed Asner try hard. Hiaasen's novel, which is about (I think) lotto winners, religious scam artists, white supremacists, and other Florida loonies, has its humorous moments. However, it mostly drags on towards a disappointing conclusion. Asner does well with his various growling accents, but the material could be a lot better."
3,"""Lucky You"" Another Hiassen Pageturner","On a recent trip to Florida with my wife and kids, I was ever watchful of running into the quirky and perverted Hiassen-like characters, so cleverly portrayed in funny but seriously disturbing plots. Disturbing because I know that there are wacko people out there, ready to take advantage of someone's luck or badluck. Call me paranoid. Call me unable-to-separate-fiction-from-reality, but is it my imagination that Carl Hiassen has single-handedly undone the marketing strategies of the Florida Chambers of Commerce and Disney World? Hasn't Carl met ANYONE who's normal he could write about? (That wouldn't be fun to read about, would it.) I always feel a bit dirty when I'm immersed in a Hiassen book, but they are oh so good! Just when you think it is safe to go back into the water - - another less-than-wholesome character does a less-than-wholesome act to a less-than-heroic hero or heroine. Hey, life can be like that, can't it? Lucky me. --- Ted DeCorte"
5,Another winner!,"I loved this book. It did not dissapoint, and I knew it wouldn't because Carl Hiaasen is an aboutsolute genius! I love all his work and will always pick up one of his novels above anybody else's!"
3,Hiaasen preaching to the converted.,"If you like Carl Hiaasen's irreverent, Florida-is-going-to-the-dogs formula (like me) you'll find what you want in Lucky You. The pacing is brisk and there's new and wonderfully perverted characters involving white supremacy, religious miracles and greed.The only false note to those of us already-converted is a full sell-out to Political Correctness in the form of an unflawed, black central character in an otherwise terribly flawed cast. Hiaasen really pulled a punch on this one."
2,Quite simply not Hiassen's best work,"I have read all of his books, including collaborative works with other authors. Typically I can't put his novels down, often staying up to all hours of the evening just to finish reading the complete text.""Lucky You"" festers where Hiassen's other books shine. The action has become almost formulaic, as if the author felt the need to satisfy his contract more than he wanted to satisfy his readers."
4,One of Hiaasen's best.,"I've read many of Hiaasen's books. They're always a lot of fun, with very powerful political leanings. If nothing else, I am always firmly convinced after finishing one that I would rather gargle battery acid than live in Florida."
2,Downhill slide ?,"As with so many authors, Mr. Hiaason's work has sadly weakened over time. Compared to the inventive characters and story lines found in Strip Tease, Double Whammy and Stormy Weather, Lucky You is NOT FUNNY. Strongly suggest that Mr. Hiaason returns to his original formula of ""Skink"" as the sub protagonist, surrounded by ""Chemo-esque"" type antagonists - who display new and exciting uses for - say - chum making machines!"
3,It's Just Not Funny,"LUCKY YOU is the least successful of all of Carl Hiaasen's books I have read. It started out to be amusing, with a preposterous plot, but it could happen. Then he adds more and more characters, none of them particularly interesting. Once the primary plot was resolved, Hiaasen goes on, and on, and on to tell the reader what happens to all of the rest of the people populating this novel. It got to be tedious and boring, but I did stick with it and finish reading all 353 pages. (Note: it might have been better if it were 253 pages.)"

1,This book is HORRIBLE!!,"This book is absolutely awful. I read it to be informed and wound up being offended. If you feel this way about having another baby, you shouldn't! This book reads like first children are the greatest joy, and all the ones who come after that are just intrusions on your perfect little family. Ugh! There are many ways to prepare your home and eldest child for a new sibling, and none of them should involve this miserable and cruel piece of garbage. As for sibling rivalry- as one of four children, and now a mother of five- I can tell you that it only happens if you allow it to happen. Foster love between your children, and they will respond by becoming great friends.I can't believe there are really women who feel this way about their second babies. God help them. I threw this rotten book in the trash. Don't waste your money on it- go buy something to celebrate the new life growing inside you and the new member of your family!!!"
4,"Great movie, ok quality","This moving is amazing, and the plot is hilarious. Marilyn and Jane make a great pair especially with the musicals. However, the quality is a bit off, but not too bad. When they first get on the boat the whole screen look like a purplish-pinkish color, but it goes away after they leave their cabin. Buy it, its a great movie."
4,A classic movie musical,"In this classic movie musical, Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell star as two entertainers and best girlfriends who embark on a ship to Paris in search of the perfect men. Lorelei (Monroe) is a gold digger intent on snagging a better catch at sea, even though her new fiance is waiting for her back home. Unfortunately, Lorelei's future father-in-law hires a private investigator to keep track of all her hijinks, and Dorothy (Russell) ends up falling for the P.I. This is a funny movie with some good musical numbers, including Monroe's iconic ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" routine. Monroe and Russell both deliver solid performances, but for some reason I just never connected to this movie the way I did with ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" and other old Hollywood musicals. Still, it's definitely a must-see classic."
4,Oh Marylin,Marylin Monroe is one of the best actresses in hollywood history. This is one of her most notable and famed movies. Gentleman Prefer Blondes.
4,Marilyn at her best.,"Very nice used set. Haven't watched all the films yet, but the ones I did were very much like on the screen. But, what I saw so far certainly is Marilyn at her best when she was still alive. Sad story about her early childhood, which certainly did not reflect on her work on film. A nice keepsake for sure from a star who left us wondering."
4,About time,"The Cash Brothers get into the digital age. Hopefully this means new stuff from the boys is coming. For those unfamiliar with their work, tight harmonies, solid songwriting, a way with melodies that will have you singing by songs end. Similar artists Jayhawks or the Bodeans come to mind."
3,"3.5 Stars - Good, but Too Much Deariness without Purpose","I have followed Andrew Cash on and off since the early 80's in Toronto when he was in Les Tranger (sp?) and his fine solo albums (when he was polically active, as was I)... So I was truly excited to rediscover him here on Amazon.However, it seems that the weariness of his brother, Peter, dominates on this disc... I dunno, I don't have an aversion to melancholy, but some of this disc it just seems pointless...I wonder about the earlier Cash Brothers disc... if there were only a review of it.OTHERWISE, the singing and musicianship is very good... Perhaps my hopes were just too high.Cheers."
1,Poor charge capacity,"After full charge, Wii complained of low battery power. Investigated why -- opened up battery case and found this unit uses 700 mAh batteries, whereas 2000-2700 mAh is typical for AA rechargeable batteries.Bottom line: do not buy. You can only use remote 1-2 hours before Wii complains that battery is too low."
5,best yoga tape I've ever done,"I didn't know much about Kundalini yoga before I bought this video, but had heard about the instructor, so I was curious.The video was not only beautiful to look at(I could actually just watch this video and listen to the music) but the workout was great. It was relaxing and invigorating by turns. The teacher was fun and I liked her sense of humor and her soothing voice.I don't understand what the viewer from Boulder Colorado was talking about, this video looks beautiful and is a unique yoga experience that makes you feel really relaxed at the end."
3,Not bad,"But could have been a bit more engaging. The begining was pretty slow and just not captivating enough for my taste. Percy is a great writer, however, this is an example of his masterful writing style."
1,Great reading? Are you kidding me?,"Who could possibly claim the following sentence (which DOES occur in this novel) is in any way good, or that it was written by an author with even a shred of skill?: ""High though he was getting, Chuck, what with his three years at M.I.T. and his 800 SAT score, is digging me utterly.""Flannery O'Connor, in a letter to one of her friends, wrote of Thomas Wolfe that anyone who admired his novels liked good fiction only by accident. The same holds true for Walker Percy."
4,Almost Perfection,"The MiniJam By Inno Gear is one of the best Springboard Modules out there, despite all of the setbacks and other problems that affected the dilivery of our modules, I must say that the MiniJam is the best because it combines 2 of the most usefull functions (memory storage MP3 playback) avilable to Visor Users, this is what the Springboard slot is about. My only gripe is that you can't store PALM OS files on the MMC cards only on the 2 megs of FlashROM, but that is suposted to come later as a software upgrade. Great Module."
5,The Best Cakes - A Dessert Lover's Dream!!!!,"Althought I promised myself I had plenty cookbooks - I HAD to buy this one, after flipping through the pages briefly. Spending time in Africa, box mixes are not an option. But, after baking the 'chocolate sweetheart cakes with soft centers' and the 'uber-chocolate cake' for guests - I'll have no trouble passing the packaged mixes from this point forward. I highly recomment this book for all cake lovers!"
3,Be careful when purchasing these online!,"I thought there to be very few sodium vapor light bulbs to purchase. It turns out that there are three different verions, each one has a different size base to the light bulb. I ended up returning these to the vendor and they were great about the return."
5,Wonderful!,"Michael Ball's wonderful and extremely beautiful voice makes every song definitely worth listening! Michael's talented renditions of all the songs - especially of ""All by myself"" - are the best ever."
4,My son loves these!,My 4 yr old is always looking for headphones to plug into my wife's kindle to watch netfix for kids. problem is he usually finds earbuds that wind up never being found again after that. these teddy bear headphones are unmistakably his and can readily be found when needed.
3,"Good enough, cheap enough","For a cheap pair of headphones these were fine. The ""red"" is more like brownish-maroon, but the character is cute. The volume control is useful and a bonus. The main - and only - drawback is that the headphones are not adjustable across the head: they either fit or don't. We bought two - one for a smallish 6-year-old, one for her larger 8-year-old sister, and both are happily wearing them. (They look real cute, too.)"
1,Item arrived broken,These headphones arrived broken ..no sound coming from the at all =( and when i tried to return the i had to pay for shipping so it was no point since it would be almost the same price i paid for them..
1,Zero - Don't waste your money,This product never worked properly. The wheels 'tracked' on a curve or height change. Then after just two months the worm gear failed rendering the item totally inoperable and useless. I bought it before it went 'on sale'...paid twice the $ and got a headache trying to contact the manufacturer. The seller won't guarantee it and the maker doesn't answer their phone number and has a website under construction since 2005! The listed business address is a gated housing complex - locked. I will amend this review if they return my money.
1,JUNK! Waste of $20,"I would rather clean my garage or driveway with a sheet of plywood than this thing. It stops dead in its tracks on a dime for no reason (well poor design), and it leaves a thin line of debris right in the middle where the brushes rotate. You thought the line a dust pan leaves behind is bad, this is a never ending thick line of debris.I bought this for $20 (with free shipping) and now am giving it away for free on my local craigslist.org to someone else who wants a headache. I would not buy this thing for $1 if it was offered to me.Save your money, a $5 brrom from Biglots will get the job done better and quicker."
4,Great Jazz Arragements for All Levels,"This book of arrangements make a nice addition to any Pop/Jazz collection. The difficulty of the pieces in this book range from a high beginner level to a mid intermediate level of difficulty. The pieces retain their original melody, but the underlying chords are altered at different intensities from song to song. The popularity of the tunes makes them fun to both practice and present to others."
5,Great fire starter!,"This electric starter is better than what you might expect. I certainly didn't expect it to follow thru with it's claim to be able to light charcoals. My husband bought this on Amazon and was very happy with the results.Here is what he has found out about this starter. The cord is a little short so you will need an extension cord to be able to plug this starter in so you can use it. He has been using this starter for quite a while and hasn't had any problems with it. He just puts it under some coals, leaves it for about 10 minutes or less, and then he can start grilling! It is so much better than drowning your coals in all that starter fluid and having that awful taste on everything you grill.Remember that when you take the starter out from under your coals to put it somewhere safe. It will still be very hot!Absolutely recommend this product!"
4,Clean grilling,"Just what I expected. No lighter fluid to contaminate the vessel and, over time, the food. A bent element would be the only improvement so the coals would more evenly heat."
3,"Looks cute, okay quality","I bought this for my cousin a while ago. It's a cute purse that can really touch up an outfit, but the chain from the side is a bit awkward. Also, the material is wearing off very quickly. Other than those two things, it's pretty nice for the price. It's also very roomy and is pretty big, it was bigger than I had expected but that's okay. Oh I also found a similar purse that I prefer more from Forever 21 for about the same price. It's called ""Quilted Faux Leather Crossbody""."
4,My 2-month old LOVES this,"My son has ALOT of toys, but this is the only one he seems to never get sick of; he especially likes the little mirror. My husband placed the mirrored toy right in the middle so our son can look at himself - he gets such a kick out of seeing the smiling baby (himself!), that he starts to swing at all the other toys in utter excitement."
3,for our newborn,We both liked thjis item but felt it should come w/ more hanging items. We had to buy 5 more to keep our little one happy.
3,Mork and Mindy MeetsThree's Company,"Two of the greatest TV stars of the 70's are put into this movie that I can't even tell if it's good or bad.Pam Dawber played Mindy on Mork and Mindy. John Ritter played Jack Tripper on Three's Company. Roy Knable and his wife are sucked into a TV that they bought from the devil. Now, is that funny or stupid. Am I braindead? Is this the godfather or is this the attack of the killer tomatoes. Help me here!"
2,"A sloppy, unfunny effort","This silly comedy is nowhere near as funny or original as it thinks it is. The concept is old-hat and has been done better in films like PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? This heavy-handed mess's script was recycled for the dreadful, even more pretentious LAST ACTION HERO, which came out the following year."
4,No Problem,"When I saw some of the low reviews given here, I nearly decided not to buy this. However, two of my friends did buy these and recommended them to me. I was hoping the silicone muffin pans would be an improvement over the metal pans, which have been difficult to clean, difficult to remove the muffins, and after a short time flake so that my muffins have little metal flecks on them.I bought a pan today, and my 13-year-old daughter used the pan right away. We noticed only a slight odor from the pan while the muffins were cooking. The muffins came out cleanly with only a slight push from the bottom of the pan. The muffins were cooked evenly and cleaning the pan was a breeze. I plan to buy more pans.The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because it is necessary to use a cookie sheet or a ""sled"" under the pan."
3,Cooks evenly - but don't like the burning rubber smell,"The items cooked in this pan bake very evenly and come out well with cooking spray - the first time I used it, I didn't use cooking spray and I thought the thing was burning up in the oven because of the burning rubber smell. I threw those muffins away - was afraid to eat them! But now I use the cooking spray and just get a whiff of the smell."
4,This is Great!,"I love this pan. I have several other pieces and they all work great. Just use a little non-stick spray, no flour. It cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have the mini-muffin pan with the sleigh, so I didn't get the sleigh with this because I thought it would fit in the mini one, but it doesn't. That is my only complaint. As for the smell, the first time I used any of my silicone bakeware, it did smell kinda like burning rubber. Pretty gross, but it only happened the first time using them."
2,I sold them at my garage sale.,"Unfortunately, if you have an older gas oven like we do, the temperature of your oven may actually be higher than the temperature at which you set it on the dial. This led to problems determining a safe temperature in which to use the trays. We were all hesitant to eat the muffins I'd made because of the chemical/plastic smell. I'm back to using foil muffin cups on a cookie sheet."
2,Disappointing,"Prepared according to directions, this was exceedingly thick and gummy -- tasted as if library paste should have been listed among the ingredients. Not quite bad enough to take the trouble of sending it back, but a near thing. Improved greatly by adding milk and a bit of sherry and pepper. DON'T ADD SALT!!!"
1,Garbage...,"I have not seen some much garbage and simple stupidity in one book in a long time. This book is full of half ""truths"", misleading statements,and dubious and shady quotes. It is hard for me to understand (which I don not) how can anyone even bother to waste his/her time writing this stuff. Doesn't the author has anything better to do? I guess not!!!!!!"
4,quality of this game is way above its listed price,"We currently have a nintendo 64, nintendo cube and an x-box system. We love to play them all, but I do have to say that we seem to have had the most enjoyment from our playstation system.It's controller is very accurate in movement and the playstation itself hardly ever needs cleaned. I have two children who play the system more than we do. And I'm sure they're not always gentle with it! We've had it for 3 years and have never had to replace any pieces to the system. The dual shock controller is really exciting for the kids, and makes the games they play more realistic! Thanks for all the great entertainment and keep up the good work. Oh yha, this system seems to have one of the largest varieties of games to choose from, so you never get bored!!"
4,not too bad at all,"PS1 has good graphics, good game play, and great games. this is a best buy for 50 bucks. this little thing gives a lot back, with over 800 titles and a 32-bit graphic system. nintendo 64 has 64-bits and PS1 is better than N64. plus if u decide to get a PS2 in the furture u can play all ur PS1 games on it."
5,Equivillant to Playstation 1.,I think this Playstation is equivillant to the original. This was a great marketing idea for sony. They will make alot of money of it. Plus you can hook it up in the car easier. it was an ingeniuos idea.
1,Why bother.,with the newer systems out why buy this. hardly games are being made for it anymore. i don't even play mine again. like a gamer said it should be discontinued like the dreamcast.
3,A good console for it's time,"If I was buying an older console I would go with a Dream Cast, but I'm not in the market for an older console. Yes, it does seem like you save money on buying a PS 1, but over the long run it's not a wise investment anymore.With the amount of competition in the console market today it's possible to pick up a PS2 for next to nothing, and Game Cubes are also incredibly good value and have special sales every so often, and bundle with great games.These are the consoles I would recommend, a PS2, or a Game Cube, a Dream Cast if you want a cheap as chips console.As for games a PS 2 has hundreds more games. You can pick them up for half the cost of a new game or less second-hand. I would rather buy a new PS 2 and second-hand games than a new PS 1 and new games.PS 1 was a good console in it's day but now there are hardly any new games that will play on it, and a new PS 1 sells about the same cost as a second-hand or refurbished PS 2 if you do your shopping."
2,not complete,I've paid 50 bucks for this thing and it's incomplete AND I WILL RETURNED and I want my money back
1,BAH,"This book leaves alot to be desired. It seems like the author might have been asked to write a book on gemstones and went out to gather a jumble of metaphysical information together and then added gemstone correspondences to them. My advice, stay away and buy something more credible."
5,A great lingerie item,"There is nothing new under the sun, right? Well, guess again. This hot little number has appeared in Playboy magazine and on Sex and the City, and your man wants to see you in one. This isn't your mother's g-string, it's a loop of soft and sexy lace, from which a string or two of faux pearls descends - sliding seductively between your legs. This thong is very sexy looking, and the sliding of the pearls produces some sensations that are beyond description!This is a great lingerie item, one that I highly recommend. My first suggestion is that you pay the extra money, and get the one with the double strand of pearls - wear it and you'll know why. My second suggestion is that you combine this thong with a pearl necklace, bracelets and earrings. Have fun!"
3,Great to give as a gift for that special lady,"I would have loved to receive these from my honey. Beautifully packaged, great quality but most certainly the most expensive panties I've ever purchased. Bought the double strand as a reviewer advised. The double strand has a little movable pearl band to adjust pressure to that 'special' area. I think they'd be best rec'd as a gift. A special item that most women wouldn't spend that much $$ on. As far as them 'enhancing' an evening, they didn't do much for me. I suspect its much more of a mental than a physical excitement. I'm glad I got them but won't order a 2nd pair."
1,Why bother? Buy Metal ones!,"There is no clear advantage to using these silicone baking pans. I am a professional baker and I have used Silpats for years - but a baking pan is a different story.First, you have to either use a peel, as mentioned by another review, or a cookie sheet under them to get them in and out of the oven without having it destroy the cake.And then you have to spray, and even that doesn't always work. I used my one silicone pan and two metal pans. I sprayed all three. The cake stuck to my silicone pan so I ended up with a two layer cake instead of a three layer cake.The muffin pans are fine, but I would avoid any of the larger pans. For the cost, you can buy similar metal ones and do what you would always do - spray them!"
2,It is mediocre at best.,"This book is all over the place, it doesn't provide good step by step instructions and it is not a good reference."
3,"Works fairly well, for a while.","I used one these for a number of years (5 to 7). It came with my pasta maker. I only used it occasionally, but it worked pretty. Eventually, the switch mechanism quit working about 5 years ago. Since then, I've been doing it the old fashioned way, but I do miss the ease of using the mixer. It mixed the egg up to the point where it looked like orange juice when you cracked the shell and poured it into the pan. Depending on what you pay for it, it's worth the investment. I didn't replace it right away because they wanted $40 for a new one, which I think is too much. If it were around $20 or less, I would buy another one. If the product were more durable, I would give it a higher rating, and probably pay the $40."
4,I need to read more books by John Fallon!,"From the first sentence to the last word, I loved this book! With so much attention to detail I really feel like I knew all the characters in this story. I didn't want to read this book too fast, because I knew once I completed the book I would miss this crazy, complex family. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a wonderful story filled with humor, sorrow and all the things that make up a family! I really hope John Fallon writes and publishes many more books!!"
4,Fallon has the gift,"In the great tradition of Irish storytelling, A Relative Matter takes us through the life and times of Geoffrey Doyle. The story moves along at a perfect pace, as Geoffrey moves from childhood into adulthood. Familial relationships and Geoffrey's changing decisions about his role in the matter are at the heart of the story. A delightful read. When is the next one coming out?"
1,Used on a 2003 dodge diesel,"I installed this pump as a ""reliability upgrade"" to replace the weak / failure prone stock lift pump. This one was installed and lasted about 1500 miles over a 4 month period and is now dead. I investigated carter's warranty and not surprisingly it is a month shorter than the useful life I got out of this pump. I will not be installing another of these style pumps."
1,A very poor introduction to Java programming!,"The book is not geared to novice programmers at all! The examples given are too complex for the concepts being discussed. Far worse then this is the fact that the authors make use of language features in the examples that are only discussed much later in the book, or not at all. For example, they use the terms Integer and String from the beginning, without ever explaining the concepts of types in languages. The code itself is inconistent and of a poor standard, the authors follow no consistent naming conventions, and use extremmely non-descriptive variable names, eg. int a and String s.Chapter 5 is a nightmare for novices, introducing, in one poorly written chapter, the concepts of event-driven programming, choices, class structure, interfaces and more! And all this without ever clearly defining any of them!All in all, the book is not worth the price, effort and time one would waste on it."
3,Helpful to know C/C++,"The first 4 chapters are an excellent introduction for beginners. Chapter 5 and later, however, would be easier to understand if you are already familiar with C/C++. The book tries to cover a vast landscape in shotgun fashon with selected examples, topics, and humorous breaks, but the explanatory text is often too superficial for novices. I spent a long time trying to figure out the complex example in Chapter 5, before deciding to go on hoping it would become clearer later. Several code examples generated that 'shrug the shoulders' type of response"
1,JAVA Programming for Dummies,"It's too bad you're forced to give this book at least one star. It's misleading. The one good thing I can say about the book though, is that the coding errors embedded in the examples do serve to strengthen the readers debugging skills."
1,Avoid this book at all costs.,"The title of the book says it all. I was a dummy to buy this book. If you want to learn Java, this book is not for you. I good ground-level book is ""Teach Yourself Java"" by Joseph O'Neil. A good 2nd book is ""Just Java"" by Peter van der Linden."
3,good book but intended for advanced dummies,"this is a good book, however, the early chapters (esp. chapter 5) could be made a lot easier to understand. However, if you have just a little knowledge of other languages such as c++ and have access to a compiler such as visual J++ or java workshop, this book should come in quite handy to the beggining java programmer."
1,not a good book at all,"it does not help a beginnerit does not help a mediocre programmerit does not help an advanced programmerso, there, I said my peace"
3,Grill Brush,"It is hard to get into the grooves of my grill with this brush. It does work ok for getting burnt food off the top, but doesn't work that well under and around the grill."
2,Just not that funny,"I used to watch Benny Hill years ago, and I guess these early years, he was still learning his craft. Because it just wasn't as funny as what used to play here in the U.S."
5,Benny Hill memories,I saw these episodes when they were first broadcast and enjoyed seeing them again. Being older I can appreciate what a comic genius he was. I placed my order with a linked supplier (they were cheaper for a new DVD) and the order was filled promptly with no problems
2,Benny Hill Stinks,"I've always had a profound dislike of this show. To be short and to the point, you would be much better off looking into some Monty Python or, at the least, some Black Adder. Why waste your time on this? Get to the good stuff! Monty Python all the way."
4,4 Volume Indispensible Reference,"I have this four volume set and would recommend it to any serious modeller or historian wishing to study the subject covered by these books. However in my opinion there is one major omission,there are no photographs or drawings of any Lockheed Constellation variant, only a small reference in one of the lists of aircraft at the back of one of the books.Having said that I really like these books and prize them greatly."
3,Lobster flavored salt,"If you're on a low Sodium diet, you should pass on this one. It adds far more salt to my recipies than I'm used to. One tsp has 830 mg. of Sodium.Makes a good bisque, however. Salty, but good.And it does come with a nice booklet of recipies."
1,Terrible,"The product took forever to ship, and once I finally got it, it was open and pieces missing from the box. Pointless buy and don't waste your money here, I'm just saving you a headache. Terrible terrible terrible terrible."
5,"Fabulous, Glamorous, Lightly Romantic and LOL Funny!","There are many assets in the movie:-The story line. Timeless, classic tale. This is a good movie to watch while you are EATING. YUM! Also great as an inspiration to watch while you are getting dressed for a special occassion. The wardrobe is FABULOUS!-The characters. GradeA portrayals of endearing models who set out to ""catch a millionaire"" by living in a NY penthouse and splitting the rent. ""If you want to meet a millionaire you have to surround yourself with them.""(or something to this effect) which is the bases of getting the penthouse.-Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe are innocent, endearing, and Lauren is stubbornly charming."
4,"How Grable, Monroe & Bacall marry a millionaire","Betty Grable, who had been Hollywood's number one female star for 10 consecutive years, was turning her crown over to Marilyn Monroe when ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" was released in 1953. Both gals, along with Lauren Bacall, are at their comedic best in one of the wittiest and most fun comedies of the 1950s. Add to the mix urbane William Powell, handsome Rory Calhoun, everyman David Wayne, and oh-so suave Cameron Mitchell, and you've got the makings of a lightweight but delightful story line. All three ladies ""settle"" for love and only one unexpectedly snags her millionaire. But the fun is in the hunt, and these three gorgeous dolls know how to hunt!"
5,"""How to Marry a Millionaire"" is georgeous and glossy.....","...it was the FIRST film 20th Century Fox made in Cinemascope.Then they made ""The Robe"" and released that first...using thesplashy ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" as a sales tool for thenew wide screen process. That is the real reason for thesymphony orchestra (conducted by Alfred Neuman)...and thepanoramic views of New York. But, even though it will not passmuster with feminists, it is a slick and saucy entertainment.Sadly it is Betty Grable's last film before she and Fox parted,but she turns in a great performance. Everyone connected withthis film is really good...and it is still a pleasure to watch.I hope that the dvd is a big success, then maybe Fox will letus have some of Betty Grable's classic films on dvd. (...)So enjoy ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" and hope that Fox willbring us more of Betty on dvd in the near future."
5,The Original Great One - not a goofy reality show!,"A great classic! Lauren, Betty and Marilyn at their best. Bacall has great timing and delivery as well as some of the best lines (e.g., ""he's a character straight from characterville"" or when asked if she thinks having money will automatically make you happy she replies, ""no, but it doesn't automatically depress me either."") Marilyn is an absolute hoot especially in regard to her reluctance to wear glasses, because ""men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses,"" as if that could ever apply to her! Grable is equally charming as a naive model who travels to a ""lodge"" with a married man because she has fond memories of an Elks Convention. It's all good, clean, fun with a clever little wrap up at the end. A definite keeper!"
2,It gave me heart burn,"I eat spicy food all of the time, but these pills killed me! I NEVER throw up, but I had to pull over on my way to work to hurl they made me so sick! I haven't taken them since."
5,Great Product!,"I have been taking this product for the past 2 months. It has helped me on my way to losing weight. I do exercise 5 days a week and have modified my diet to a healthier diet. So it is not alone the pills. I eat spicy meals 3 times a day, everyday of the week and the pills have never made me sick. I take them twice a day for 5 days as directed on the bottle. I have never used a better product!"
3,Lousy Audio,Audio tracks on several of the dvds was very low quality. The case was also low quality with all 4 dvds on one spindal. Easy to scratch. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased these due to the lowsy audio quality.
3,a little bit of a letdown,"I really like this show but this collection was a bit of a dissapointment. It seemed like these episodes had a lot of going to a location and finding nothing. My other sets of the show (season 1 and season 2-part 1)had several hunts on which something interesting happens, but this time 95% of the episodes ended with them coming up with nothing (although the lighthouse episode was one of the best). I wish they could have spread out the good episodes with the more boring ones so each set is more varied. nothing against the show at all, just the mix of episodes in the set."
3,Part 2 of slickly produced season,"(See my review for Part 1 for more details)Entertaining show and, arguably, the best season so far."
3,WTF?,"I am a huge paranormal fan and as well am a fan of T.A.P.S. I can appreciate the fact that before they assume every little bump in the night in an investigation is in fact paranomrmal activity, they try to debunk it. And while the episodes on this dvd are indeed worth paying for, the sound quality completely makes it not worth paying for. I mean ive purchased bootleg dvds before that had better sound then this supposedly packaged and nice product. My wife actually got a headache from the dam sound quality and i too just found it to annoying to give the episodes my full attention. Bottom line, i wont buy anymore sets."
5,ghost hunters,"Awsome product! I love this show, and now I can watch it anytime I want! Like the bonus footage as well."
2,A Better Tomorrow 2012 3D,MOVIE IS FAIR BUT THE 3D IS TERRIBLE PICTURE PUSHED BACK IN TV AND ONLY HAS KOREAN & GERMAN AUDIO NO ENGLISH.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.R.KING
1,Empty sheet,"I received the box with An empty roll inside. No labels, only the sheet the labels were already peeled off. Please either replace this item or refund my money, I am very disappointed with this item.w"
2,Grey's Anatomy Season 5,Delivery time was very good. Two of the discs are defective. Could not watch the last two episodes of the season! This was very disappointing. Would like to receive a replacement but am not sure how to go about that?
1,this is not good,i have bought some stuff from amazon and i still dont have any coupons. i bought some one thing that cost 18$ from evesaddiction and they sent me couponright away. I wanna know why amazon.com cant send me any coupons.
2,poor prep,"this item came packaged upside down, the holders for the dvd's were not attached to the box; I had to glue them, put them right side up and re-package them; very poor way to send out a product; I would not buy from them again. Buy at your own risk...I have spoken."
5,Awesome season!!!,"Season 5 was awesome from the very beginning. For some strange reason some people don't think so. They are insane. Grey's was the best it has been since season 2. Season 5 is full of great storyline!!! I will definitely be buying it the day it comes out. I love Christina and Owen, Meredith and Derrick, Izzie and Alex, Sloan and Lexie, and Calli and Arizona!!!! Buy it!!"
1,worst watch i've ever had,"i've been running nearly all of my life and buy a new running watch about every year or two. and this watch is by far the worst one i've had. the colored parts on the side came off. when i swam, it fogged up. then the first number ""1"" went blank so I could not tell if it was 11:00 or 1:00, etc. the color of the band also faded to a gross brownish color. i bought another one with the elastic strap b/c of the gross coloring of the other one, but the watch itself had all of the same problems, except that this time the whole thing went blank after a couple of months. i used to love timex iroman watches, but this model sucks."
1,NOT reliable,"I LOVED my Timex, at first. I have had it 6 months and have put 3 batteries in it, I give up! I guess Timex no longer ""takes a licking and keeps on ticking"". I am going back to Fossil brand!"
2,Downhill after six months,I loved this watch at first...then about six months in the plastic around the buttons started popping off.The watch strap stays on somehow but by eight months all four buttons were exposed and I couldn't get the plastic to stay around the buttons anymore. Finally the battery died at around eleven months and I won't be replacing it. The thing I don't like is that you can't replace the strap. I would like to keep a watch for years but with the design on this one once the strap breaks down that's it.
1,Decent functionality but no durability,"I bought this watch for working out and was impressed with the readability and chronograph functionality. However, a little over a year into usage, the band completely severed and I don't think there's any way to replace it because the band is not a typical watch band. I've tried using superglue and duct tape to keep the two parts of the band together but it only holds up for a couple of days before falling apart again. If you are looking for a durable watch, look elsewhere."
3,sharp copier drum,"Ok but it prints too dark, so with each use we have to manually set the machine exposure to ""lighter"" for it to print normally."
4,Horrible Ending,"I saw the trailer for it and wasn't really psyched about the moving being in German so I bought it on DVD b/c it said it had the English version. The English overdub was horrible so I ended up just putting it on German anyway and enjoyed the movie. I liked the premise something a little different, but of course as in all ""end of the world"" movies there has to be cannibalism so that was predictable. I liked the movie until the end. They showed them and I was like ok whats gonna happen next and then the credit rolled. I was like feeling like um? That was it?? Bottom line: Good movie - Horrible ending."
5,Wow I'm impressed .,"This is a really entertaining documentary story. The adventure of the two robots as they explore and discover the surface of Mars is as big a challenge as anyone can imagine. Backed by the enthusiastic ground control and passionate dedication you as the viewer get drawn in to this excellent story telling and state of the art graphics and sound like a child at a campfire listening to his or her first ghost story. I absolutely adored the scientists' metaphors as they describe the problems and triumphs in the operation from so far away. It left me feeling like I had been there and wanting more. There must be a sequel, The story must go on!!"
1,Disappointing Effort,"Five years, two rovers, and hardly any genuine Mars images except for a lot of computer animated garbage. It would have made much more sense to base this documentary from the rovers own eyes, and not the NG art studio."
5,More than what you think,"At first I thought, criticize the preacher?? Who would do that? But being honest with myself, I guess I've been guilty of that too. Horrors! What a thing to admit. And to a preacher-man like Pat Jobe. Forgive me.When I started reading 365 Ways, I thought it was going to be a good-natured spoof of small Southern churches. Fun reading. Well, it is that. But it's far more. As I progressed with Beverly's diary, I became an observer to the woman she really is, though sometimes judgemental of her. Soon my own hurts erupted, tears filled my eyes, and I realized that Pat Jobe had weaved book of healing. I was right there with Beverly , looking on and wanting to let go of my hurts, but afraid. We were not so different after all.Now I'm reading it again, but with new light. Thank you, Pat Jobe, for the light you shed on this sometimes weary reader. And thank you for showing me the way to the Grand Canyon.I may read 365 Ways again."
5,"Rich, Thoughtful, Amazine!","I have been fortunate enough to hear this e.p. before its release, and I can tell you that it is truly amazing. Imagine Lenny Kravitz meets Jonatha Brooke meets Led Zeppelin. Fantastic!"
2,Will shrink!,This got really grubby from my son taking his doll everywhere. I washed it in the washer and dryer and it did not survive. It shrunk and became ratty and frayed. You should be able to clean toys easily. This certainly cost enough to be a real baby outfit.
3,Obviously by Laymon,"You can always tell a Laymon book. Unbelievable people, unnecessary sexual situations, oddly hard to put down. This is the 6th book I've read by Laymon, definitely not one of the better ones. The most unbelievable situation so far - he cheats on his girlfriend - instead of her bugging out, accepts it and jumps right it - yeah right. But Laymon as usual does a decent job with pacing and making it an enjoyable read. If you are looking for a great work of literature - do not read a Laymon book. If you are just looking for a book to have fun (intentional and intentional) with, then by all means pick up some of his books. Though they are not the best books in the world, I will continue reading them."
3,"Overall Sick album, but not Sickmade's best work","This album is generally sick, with some tight Phonk Beta beats. But some of the songs either appear in other albums or are weak to me. The first song is the best. Then I like 1st Come 1st Serve (that beat is sick and mellow. The second song is aiight. I wasn't really feelin the song wit Ice-T, even though he's da' O.G. This album doesn't come close to ""Season of da Sickness"" or ""Now Eat."" Oh yeah Phonk Beta's song is coo. Overall get it Bcuz they got that phonk on this album. I wish I could get a instrumental of that first song main I'd tear that beat up wit some sick raps! Gone."
1,Not for me...,"I bought two of these large spatulas about three months ago and now wish I wouldn't have. I definitely do not use these every day because, personally, I think they are almost to big for most jobs and a little too flimsy. Even with minimal use and only hand washing, one of the spatulas is already beginning to tear."
5,Great Psychedelic Mood Music!,"A friend tipped me off about this band, and I'm glad they did. From the first song through the last, this album creates a swirling psychedlic mood. The guitars are the focus of the music. There are layers of guitar, but it's not overdone; there's enough space left for you to fall into the songs. The vocals are soothing and provide extra melody. Anyone who likes to 'escape into an album' should experience this. It's a solid CD from tracks 1 thru 8 (too bad it's not longer). Nevada Hut is probably my favorite track, though it changes each week. Dim the lights, have a beer (or 6) and drift into peaceful bliss with this CD."
2,Only 2 Stars in Her Crown,I finally broke down and read this book because it appears on a lot of pagan reading lists.I found the story to be somewhat strained and disjointed. The author provides a long list of sources at the end but many of them are outdated and discredited works.I realise it's fiction but it's fiction based on fiction for the most part. Enjoy the read but take with a whole box of salt. Don't look for any historical logic (even of an alternative kind) or profound revelations.
5,Wife loves it.,"Bought this for my wife, an ardent knitter, for Christmas. She says it is the finest book of hat patterns she has encountered. Recommended."
3,"cute hats, but....","I purchased this book some time ago, but only recently tried to make a hat from one of the patterns. I agree with other reviewers: there are entirely too many ""mistakes"" in this book. Either it was a very poor editing job or very poor writing and rushed to production. Check the errata before you try to knit any of the patterns as most have mistakes and corrections which you need to get from the author's website (not the publisher). I have now knit 2 of the patterns, including the cover hat and the hats are stylish and relatively easy knitting. Also check the sizing--I'm not sure her measurement of ""medium"" is accurate for all the patterns."
5,So many FUN hats,"Easy, fun, unique, irresistable hats to make for self and give as gifts. This book also makes a good gift for your knitting friends."
4,Nice Hats---But Be Warned,"I saw this book last week and just had to order it.I love the hats in this book. Most are variations of the top down method with a wrap cast on of 12 stitches. In fact, I learned the wrap method from this book, and I had never made a top down hat before.I also liked the photos and expecially the variations with other weights of yarn.I made two hats(Violet Seed and Valery)already, and I love how they turned out. However, there were minor mistakes in the patterns that I could get around. I also know of some errors in at least one other pattern--Bobbi.I have sent an e-mail to the publisher for an errata sheet.Even so, I would recommend this book. It's wonderful for last minute gifts and knitters with some experience should be able to get around the pattern errors."
2,"Styles are great, but be prepared...","The styles in this book are great but if you are a new knitter or inexperienced, I would not recommend this book. There are many errors and I have re-written every pattern I have tried (which is 5 so far). The instructions for the crown are all wrong, and you will be confused from the beginning.If you are an experienced knitter, you will be able to figure these out and make your own adjustments as necessary."
3,Heavy Weight Burgundy Flannel Duvet,"Although this duvet met my needs (our dog ate our other one), I wouldn't consider this flannel. Rather, it's more of a burshed-cotton feel. Price of $9.99 plus shipping is reasonable."
3,So-so,"The subject matter (preschool kids) is not really to my liking. But, sometimes a book can be so well written I find myself actually intrested in a subject I don't usually find entertaining. This book didn't do it though. I made it half way through and tossed it aside. Patti Wollman took a subject and made it rather heavy. I mean, it wasn't very humorous and the chapters were a bit long. I guess it wasn't a bad book it just didn't interest me as a reader."
2,This book is too padded with usless quotes!,"This book has way too many analogies and usless quotes. Lack of screen shots and step by step instructions. This book could have been half it's size without it's long drawn out analogies! I would recommend buying ""USING NetWare 3.12"" by Que. A much better book, to the point and has step by step instructions!"
1,Great for Neophytes,"Bought this book expecting something spectacular but didn't find it. For the newbie. this is an excellent book since it has snippets of every magickal practice you would need to know your first year but they are snippets only, no real depth to any one subject."
4,Snak King Tropical Trail Mix,Tastes good. Good price. I would have preferred it without preservatives.
5,"Most reliable wine cooler on the market - no leaks, lasts forever","These are great....have always been great and will always be great. I had attempted, prior to this purchase, to obtain much cheaper and newer products that do the same but they leak and last only a few weeks. These things last for years."
5,A welcome introduction,"A first-rate introduction to an underground art movement that blends cartoony pop culture elements with fine art sophistication. True to the spirit of the art, the book is fun to read and packed with colorful details about the artists, their work, and the history of the movement. The selection of art provides a good overview of each artist's work and the print quality of the art is excellent -- clear, bright, and detailed. The book's zany and beautiful design complements the art. Highly recommended."
5,"Works well, easy to install","This O2 sensor was easy to install. The OEM plug worked with my car's wiring harness. The cable appeared to be too short when I got it out of the box, but it's the correct length. I like that it has a bit of anti-seize on it. So you don't have to doubt if you put too much or too little anti-seize on it when installing it, or if your anti-seize wasn't conductive, etc."
2,umbra walnut frame,I was not happy with this frame. I thought it looked cheap. It looks better on the internet than it does in reality! Not a great quality frame.
1,Don't Bother- Avoid the Insanity,"Don't Bother - Avoid the InsanityI have had my heart broken by too many of these styles of ironman watch. The watch itself is Good, but the wristband does not last longer than a year. Then you are stuck with a watch that works but is un-wearable because there is no way to replace this type of band. NO Band Available.I know because I have 5 watches (so obviously I liked the watch mechanism) - At first I thought it was just a fluke that the wristbands broke. But I finally remembered - a definition of insanity is repeating the same action over and over and expecting different results.Now some of my watches are still ticking away in a drawer because there are No replacement wrist bands. It doesn't matter how great the watch is - if you can't wear it."
2,Disappointed!,"In under six months with normal use (3 or 4 runs a week and a couple of dunks in a swimming pool) this watch is no longer waterproof and the band has stretched to the point that the watch face won't stay connected. It is very easy to use and very comfortable, but it is almost at the point where it has become worthless. I will look for a different watch next time."
3,Bought this watch for the interval timers,"I am a fairly new runner and have been building up my pace and mileage by doing the run/walk method of training. I wanted a watch that had interval timers for this purpose. I didn't want to spend a lot, and thought this watch would be perfect. It's a great little watch...looks nice, has the features I want...BUT the problem is I cannot HEAR the chime while I am running! I tried turning my music down super low and still couldn't hear it, if a car drives by...can't hear it. The tone of the chime just blends right in with any sounds in the environment. I hate running without music, so this is really disappointing. I have gone running with a friend of mine and can hear her watch's interval alarms with no problem over my music. I guess I will have to keeping looking at it to know when to walk, and that's what I wanted to avoid. One of these days I will invest in a Garmin for running."
4,Good for run/walk interval training,"If you are a fan of the walk/run training of Jeff Galloway, this type of watch (with two interval timers) is essential. Just set the interval timers and switch from walking to running (or vice versa) every time you here the watch chime. I like the compact size of the watch. My only beef is that the chime is pretty quiet and I have to really listen for it. If you like to run with music, it would be hard to hear."
5,Great for exercise!,"This watch is perfect for running or any type of exercise! I haven't had it for long, and typically only wear it during a workout, but it's great. The timer and interval function are perfect, and it's relatively easy to use. I've just started to get into running so I like to set run/walk times and I love that it tells you how many intervals you have done. Great watch!"
2,Well designed but doesn't stand up to use,"I have had this Ironman watch for about a year. I have been really happy with the interval timer function and the watch in general, but it has not held up to a year of regular use. I wear it probably about 75% of my waking hours. I take it off, of course, to sleep, shower, and swim, but I do wear it when I run, bike, hit the weight room, and at work. In a year's time, the band has broken because it is very thin where it wraps around the watch face, and over time it has become slightly brittle and worn out. The strap is also highly susceptible to discoloration (soaks up dyes from clothing like a sponge) but I imagine that this is a problem with many similar watches. Another problem I've had is the indiglo function ceasing to work within a few months of purchasing the watch. Now pressing the indiglo button just makes the screen go blank. I wear the watch a lot but am pretty careful with it, so I have been surprised by how quickly it has worn out."
2,Terrible band and warranty,"The watch's warranty makes you pay 7$ for shipping and handling if it has a manufacturing problem, which it usually has when inmersed in water for the first time. That in itself is a great business for Timex. Then the watch works pretty good for up to a year when the band falls apart and the water goes in. It is very disappointing."
4,It's ok,"This is my second Timex Women's Ironman watch. This one feels a little cheaper than the previous model I had; the silver plastic part surrounding the face just looks and feels cheap. I'm not really sure how else to describe it. Other than that, the watch is just fine. It does what it's supposed to do, and I haven't had any problems so far. No complaints here."
3,Triathalon watch,The watch was everything I wanted. I used it for a 1/2 ironman and it gave me the splits. However the watch is defective because it leaks which is concerning.I have not tried to get a exchange yet so am not sure of how the service is going to turn out.I love the quick fuss free deliver I have gotten on Amazon.Willie
3,"Ok, but must use a tripod",I've had this lens for about 6 months. I noticed that it's really shaking when you are tying to use it when zooming in and out. But I guess with any telephoto lens it may be that way during videotaping. It should work fine if you use a tripod.
1,Viking ram,"I ordered a 512MB DDR400/PC3200.But for some reason , they sent me a stick of 512MB PC2600.Its hard to believe this was an accident,or shipping mix-up.I am unhappy to say the least, since I placed my trust in paying up front ""online""A.Reo"
5,My all-time favorite musical,"If I were stranded on a desert island with a VCR and could only have one musical, this would be it. It's without a doubt one of the most perfect examples of the genre ever made. Every song is a winner, and this movie (unlike so many movie versions of musicals) is faithful to the original stage production, no doubt because it was produced by the producer of the Broadway play and starred many of the original cast (notably Robert Preston as Harold Hill, one of the great characters in musicals). What I love about this is the charm of the story, the appeal of the characters, and above all the catchiness and extreme cleverness of the songs; many of the songs are more spoken than sung and thus represent a kind of early rap music :-) Make sure you get the widescreen version - you won't want to miss anything."
5,not that it needs another positive recommendation . . .,"we bought this for our 5- and 8-year-old grandchildren, both boys. they didn't care much for the so-called girly-parts (marian's ballad esp) but they BOTH embraced the rest of the movie and have been singing many of the songs."
5,The musics and the person are just terrific,"I like this film because I like the music man acts. He acts terrific and outstanding. My favorite part is when he fell in loved with the woman that she is a librarian. He is also a funny guy. Also, this film uses classic english (that I always like). I would given this 50 stars, but the highest number is 5. Also, this movie has no errors. I think you should watched it. For those who hated music movie, then I suggest you not to watch it because mostly this movie is musical. This movie is way lot better than ""The Sound of Music"""
2,Poor DVD quality,"The first and last thirds of the movie are Ok -- not great quality -- but the middle third hangs up time after time. You must fast forward to get it past the ""bad spot"" and then resume watching. But you can't go back and watch or listen to the piece that you've missed or it hangs up (freezes) again."
4,Classic Americana,"The Music Man is one of Hollywood's music Classics. RobertPreston's performance is superb, along with Shirley Joneswho help make this film an all time classic and one for theDVD library.Eric"
4,Good music.,"This was one of the VHS tapes I gave to the nursing home where my wife lived.I thought it was gone forever, but your disc brought it all back. I will alwaysbe greatful."
3,The Music Man,I was not happy with the quality of this dvd. The duet between Shirley Jones and the barber shop quartet was a HUGH disappointment. You can only here the barber shop quartet singing and Shirley Jones voice is silent and only her lips move. This is one of the better songs in the movie and I was upset needless to say. I will think twice before buying from this setter again. Maybe I should have realized that a cheaper price does not insure a quality product.
5,CD for All Generations,This is a great CD. My family has been listening to this album since i was a baby probably before. It's our Christmas tradition. I'm 15 years old and I always look forward to listening to it at Christmas.
3,Very Clinical,This book had a few good suggestions for the lay person working with an apraxic child. But for the most part it is directed at the Speech therapist. The tools and assessments are for the speech therapist and not a parent to use. The terms and techniques are very clinical. The two best pieces of advice in the book for a parent or lay person are to use Dr. Suess books and slower music. Good luck.
3,I don't use it now,"I have yet to use this textbook as a practical manual when workikng with children with Childhood Apraxia of Speech. It was a required text for a class, but that was all I ever used it for."
1,Show is perfect but this box set is ridiculous...,"Note: This review is not about the show but about the product A&E; is delivering to us Homicide Fans. Season Six is--and always will be--my absolute favorite.First off, NO SUBTITLES or CAPTIONING for the hearing impaired. Second, the sound quality is less than perfect as is the picture quality which shows its age with muddy colors, faded backgrounds.To add insult to injury, the selection menus are not user friendly. Once you've completed watching an episode, the menu does not go back to the main but to the menu from which you selected the episode in the first place.Lastly, THE EPISODES ARE SHOWN OUT OF ORDER!!!! Blood Ties 1, 2, and 3 and Subway are on the first disc when actually three other episodes came after Blood Ties 3.Boo on A&E; for releasing such junk. I foolishly bought Homicide Seasons 1&2 for my collection but have rented the rest from Netflix!"
1,false advertisement!,The picture shown here are 3 yo yos and a box of 48 pieces. I only recieved ONE piece! Definitely not worth the price for a cheap and breakable toy. I thought I was getting a box after doing some googling & research on this product with other merchants. it costed more for shipping to me and now back to Amazon!
3,Nice scenery,The tidal shore shots are beautiful as well as the sea life. Dolphins and seals. Foamy waves crashing in. This is africa so viewer should be able to adjust to accents and word translations on screen. The first hour is slow. Picks up some after that. Would have liked to have seen more resolution to the ending. The attack views are dulled some. My grandson watched and enjoyed the movie more than me.
5,Surealism as the actual reality,"Palinuro of Mexico is a long surreal voyage throughout everything, full of obscure refrences, and quotations, Palinuro takes you on a trip were Mexico and all of its small surrealistic features come to light, were the abnormal is the commonplace and were Palinuro sets out on a journey of self-universal-discovery. Once you have read it you will be the same"
2,review,I think this review is ok for getting through the game but there are so many typos and several mistakes. One mistake is on the art list in the back it screwed up one of noa's arts.
1,Doesn't Last Long,"The slicer fell apart after less than 2 months, after about a half-dozen uses. The slicer part became detached from the body."
3,fun,"This is a great tool. I actually bought two so I can give one away as gift. But to be fair, it does waste a lot of the pineapple meat. The slicer is only efficient on the smallest pineapple. But if you are using the pineapple as a cup for party drink, then it won't matter.Also I found the slice of pineapple a little bit too thin. It's about 1/2 of the depth of a pineapple you would find from can pineapple. I wish the slice would be bigger, but still fun tool for the party."
5,It's GREAT,"It's strong and easy to use. Just slice the top off the pineapple, put the slicer on top and turn, it cuts and cores in less than a minute and you have the pineapple sliced and ready to eat. Plus you can use the remaining shell as a cup or bowl. No more slicing the pineapple in half and then slicing the halfs again and again to get wedges and then trying to cut off the outer skin and picking out the ""eyes"" that remain in the pieces , now you still had to cut the core off and each wedge into pieces -- it was a lot of work and always made a mess."
5,Great looking slicer that actually does what it says.,"Super easy to use and it does not shred the pineapple. It cuts it in one continuous spiral. And I love how it leaves behind the core and the shell, and if you break off the core, you have a nice drink container!"
4,Almost Perfect,The black handle is plastic and is designed to come off by pressing through the holes where the handle fits. This allows you to slide the cored pinapple off the tube. The problem is after some wear the handle will just pop off when you try to pull the pineapple out. Otherwise it is a cleaver and very useful tool.
5,Simply Amazing!,"I Love fresh pineapple, but hated having to cut it up. This Pineapple slicer is amazing. Everyone should have one. I can cut open and be eating fresh pineapple in 5 minutes! It is very easy and easy to clean. I LOVE IT!"
5,pineapple slicer,My son had used this pineapple slicer and I was so impressed that I wanted one in my kitchen. I researched different ones and decided that I wanted a stainless steel one not plastic. I am short so it is easier for my tall husband to actually use the slicer but it does a fine job with little effort.
2,BORING,"he gives plenty of stats and fine details but forgets that he's talking about people. it becomes very boring and lifeless, too much emphasis on details and not enough on the players behind the numbers. i recommend "" baseball in 41' "" by robert creamer, a fine book something that ""more than merkle..."" should've had more of."
1,So frustrated,"These are worthless! I bought these to go with my DYMO 450 Turbo to print postage for my business. No where in the product description does it say that these will not print a tracking number and that they do not work with any software (including their own DYMO software). After contacting DYMO support all they could do was confirm what I had spent three hours figuring out, they don't work with any software and they don't print a tracking number. Product description needs to be updated to include these important facts. I never would have bought them if I had known this. I wasted a lot of valuable time with these and had to cut and tape about 100 labels by hand while I waited for different labels to show up. Needless to say, an overall horrible and frustrating experience!"
1,Awful product and service.,"The phantom power does not work. I tried troubleshooting by the process of elimination. My AKG microphone works fine on my Mackie mixer. I sent it to Rolls during my 1 year warranty, and they just sent it back to me. I called them, and they told me to send it in again, but it's out of warranty now. Never buy this product if you're going to use a condenser microphone."
5,Reasonble price for Building the Alaska Log Home,"I called the publisher, Alaska Northwest books (ph# 1-800-452-3032). They will do another reprint of this book toward the end of the summer of 2006 (Aug/Sept). The cost of the book will be $29.99 plus shipping and handling. So why is the seller judioops trying to sell a used copy of this book for $87.99? If you want this book, wait until the publisher releases the reprint or call the publisher directly and place a order for this book."
5,Hanoi Hilton.,"Very moving film about the American captives and others held at Hanoi Hilton during the Vietnam War, I really can not understand how one human to another can carry out the cruel acts, but this situation is still going on somewhere now. Worth purchasing to view how these boys really did suffer, hopefully we may never forget."
4,Great companion with real lessons.,"I recently started taking power yoga classes at the local Y, and wanted to get a DVD that I can work with at home. I purchased this DVD because my instructor recommended Rodney Yee. It's the perfect companion to use in addition of taking actual courses, you get to practice the poses and its flow that you learn in class with three separate 25 minute segments or one entire workout.Yee does go quite quickly with the poses, but I think it's part of the rhythm of yoga. Definitely not suitable for someone that has no prior knowledge of yoga."
2,Definitely NOT for Beginners!!!,I would give it a three star but downgraded it because it is already overated. I am a Beginner-Intermediate yogi and found this DVD:- Too fast- Timing is off- Too much focus on arm strength- Cool down exercise at end of each 20 minute section is an interruption to a combined 60 minute workout
1,"Impressive, but not for beginners","I watched the interview and thought 'Great. Eventually I'll be able to do this too.' Then I watched the first program and realized that there is no instruction whatsoever for the novice.I've never tried yoga before and after watching the one segment one time, offered the dvd to my sister (otherwise I would have thrown it out).If you are not very flexible already, look for something else. I would only recommend this to someone who already has some yoga background and can start right out doing most of the positions."
4,"effective workout, but....","The Rodney Yee workouts will provide you with almost instant results. In three to four days of practice you will notice a marked improvement in your energy level. Your posture will also improve; however, these exercises are not for beginners. If you have some experience with yoga then try the Yee workouts. They're strenuous, muscle toning, and ligament stretching programs. For anyone involved in competitive sports these yoga exercises will help to lessen the chances of twists and sprains, but to reiterate, if you are new to yoga approach these DVDs with common sense and please do not subject yourself to overstraining and possible injury."
5,Brilliant Blocks!!,"These boxes are wonderful and they are one of my daughter's favorite toys. She's 11 months old and she's had them for 3 months now. Not a day goes by without her spending some time with them and she's always doing something new with them. Some days they are drums, some days they are used as containers, today she was using them to hold on to while she practices standing and balancing. She's even used them to sit on so they are quite durable. The artwork is lovely and she enjoys looking at the pictures. I never expected them to be such a hit!"
3,good to sleep to,my boyfriend absolutely loves these. i honestly don't see anything in any of the eppisodes. but it's good to fall asleep to! lots of whispering and night camera mode!
5,"Martin's ""The Dead Don't Dance""","A really, really good book. I enjoyed it from start to finish.I would highly recommend it... I've read about five other books fromMr. Martin and they were all well written and easy to read."
2,not that great,"Ok...first off, was the budget so low on this one that they couldnt explain what was supposedly happening?(thankfully they wrote it on the back of the rental box), and Jennifer Love Hewitt was barely in this, although she is listed as one of the main characters...ditto for matthew lillard! If they had JLH and ML in this movie more it probably would've been more of a comedy, cuz they were hilarious in their little parts. Obviously the ppl who made the film put their names on the front in order to cash in. This movie has some moments, but it is really pointless and you're always saying a good part is going to come, but it doesn't. Perhaps if this had been made a big shot film company rather than an indie one, it would've been better..."
5,A great movie for young adults (not teens.),"Someone who reviewed this movie said that it was not a a good teen movie. I don't think it is a teen movie at all. I saw this movie with a friend of mine and we both loved it. I have recently finished college and I have been going through some of the things that the people in the movie go through. I have been running into people that I haven't seen since high school and it is ackward and sometimes I don't want to see them. The part of the movie with the homeless man telling the Rime of the Ancient Mariner was a little bit strange, but all in all it was a great movie for recent college grads coming home."
2,inside scoop,"I was one of the writers on the original screenplay. I think the movie turned out pretty well for a couple of first time writers. Those of you who find so much fault with it should try writing your own screenplay-- very difficult. The script could definitely have used some work-- the director made very few changes to the original script. BUt for a first time adventure for all, not bad. If i had known then what I know now, the script would have been alot tighter. But it was a a thrill to have such wonderful cast, I think they saw the simplicity in the plot and thought it would be fun; no one was expecting an Oscar nomination for the film. So if you're looking for memorable plots and performances this movie is not for you. It is not the worst movie ever made (How about Tom Hanks in That Thing You Do?) It happens to the best of 'em."
5,Greatest ice cream scoop ever made!!!!!,"This one cuts through the hardest ice cream with ease. Easy clean up as well, just rinse with hot water."
5,Works too well,"Quality scoop. Makes scooping ice cream out of the box, too easy. So, I eat more ice cream. Really good product."
1,non-compatable download,"Now, I understand that Sci-fi isnt selling these items anymore on itunes as a video download... b/c NBC isnt doing that (and NBC Universal owns Sci-fi I think) whole itunes thing anymore. But I have a major complaint.Why is it that you only do these video downloads for PC's only and for portable video players that very few people actually own? I was seriously looking forward to catching up on season 4 - and loading them onto my ipod and I can't.I understand that the TAPS guys have no control over how their content is sold, so I am not pissed at them, I am pissed that the people who think that making this stuff compatable for pc's only and for crappy portable video players is okay. It's not. Compress these items for OSX too please... we like our TAPS and we like to watch them on Apple products. And no, I am not a fanboy(girl) but yes, I would like to be included!THX."
3,Nice,"The book is nice, pictures and words match. Let you experience different positions with your partner."
4,A definite buy,"I am interested in bonsai arrangements for very large trees, such as the redwoods. This was provided in the book. I would have liked to see more details in this book on the sequoia sempervirens but I have not been able to find this tree in other books on bonsai."
1,waste of my time and money.,"thought it was great given the price, and i got what i payed for. battery seemed like it fit propperly but it never charged. never bothered getting a refund or anything, i just cut my losses, but i'll never go about it that way again."
3,Not so private,"Things heat up in season two on Private Practice. As with this whole show the storylines are reasonably unbelievable. Charlotte King takes on a far more prominent role and unfortunately Del and Cooper (my favourite characters) take a bit of a back seat. The best thing about season two is the absolute cliff-hanger ending that makes one go straight out and buy season three. Season two lives up to season one standards (which is difficult for a tv drama to do), and there are some really great individual episodes."
1,Useless.,"I was led to believe that this game would play in the Xbox 360 console, but it will not. There are only 70% of original Xbox games that will play in a 360, which should've been listed in the game description that it does not have an updated format, therefore it will not play in a 360. That way I wouldn't have wasted $15.85 of my hard earned money.Very disappointed. Will not buy from them again. Future recommendation: List consoles it can or can't be played in.& just so everyone knows, The first Big Motha Truckers for the original Xbox will play in a 360. It is a part of the 70% of original Xbox games that have an update for a supported format in the Xbox 360 gaming console."
2,A huge 5 star but for this annoying problem...,"The light keeps flickering shortly after having it installed by a licensed electrician. I then changed the bulb and that didn't help. It's very frustrating as the fan looks and works awesome but without the light, it doesn't serve my purpose. I will have another electrician look at it today and then make my decision. Returning it would be a real shame because I so love everything else about it."
2,One big bomb,"What a dud. Love Empire Earth. Still play it. EE2... Doesn't even come close. More like rise of nations (which I hate too).They didn't even include their classic ""all your base are belong to us"" in it. If you want a great game, get EE1. If you want to try EE2, wait a few months and pick it up for a song. Trust me, you won't be sorry you waited."
4,"Great game, Great concepts, too bad some units look silly in certain Epochs","A great RTS game that makes some great game play additions and intergrates great new features that will be considered mandatory for future RTS games.The only problem I found was that some units that appear in certain Epochs don't have unit appearence considered appropriate for that Epoch. Look at scouts in the final 4 Epochs, and spies in Epochs 12-13 or 14. Same great function thoughout the game, but spies appear as a 1900's looking unit for too long, and scouts in the final Epoch look like those who explored early North America, where the year for the Epoch reaches far into the 21st Century. These are just examples, others can be seen, and it makes certain Epochs look silly.A great game, some minor unit-looking tweaks would be nice, but other than that a great game to add to your RTS collection."
4,Solid RTS,"If you love history and a quality RTS, then you found your game. This RTS boasts a number of improvements over the first, in fact this is the best game in the series. Customizing and battlefield control is excellent. I highly recommend this game. (Gamer for over 20 years)."
5,Problem with the Binding,"The binding for the edition of Winning His Spurs published by Quiet Vision is quite poor. Even on my first reading of the book, pages were falling out. At this point, I'm planning to punch holes and put the pages in a 2-ring binder. The story is wonderful for all the reasons others have stated, but I would recommend an edition other than this one."
2,"Sick, twisted","I had an idea from other reviews that I was about to read a book that was written by a perve, but I did not see that coming. This book is written in the format of a diary. It is 500 pages long, but about 250 pages is all about nipples, bare skin, hard ons and many other similar things. Which would be fine if this was meant to be an erotic read. It's not, from beginning to end it is a sick book. The end being almost the sickest. I read the entire book, so I can't give it one star. I did finish, but kind of wish I never would have started."
2,So queire,This was a amazingbook except for all the perversion Rupert is as bad as WesleyThe book is very weird
1,Island,This was the worst book I have ever read and would not recommend wasting your time with. I thought it was demented and disgusting and I will not read another one of Richard Laymons books.
2,"Man, I should be a writer","Several of my friends recommended Laymon and then loaned this book to me. It is a fast read and somewhat entertaining. How could Stephen King ""recommend"" Laymon? Evidently Laymon's core audience is teenagers who enjoy the constant horniness of the characters. I thought the book was fairly good until I realized what I was reading was all I was going to get. No plot twist or shocking turn. I knew the ending about half way through. If this guy was a bestseller, I think we all should consider writing for a living!"
2,Gory,Too weird for me. Too much killing and mutilation. Not necessary for a good story. i'll know not to buy another one of Laymon's books.
3,"Interesting Plot, poor story",Unnessary fixation on womans bodies. unnessary gory descriptions. I would not recommend this author mostly for his writing style -- just so so
2,Good storyline but very disappointing,If you are a 15 year old male you may just love this book. For my taste though Mr. Laymon went of the track too many times with adolescent sexual fantasy. Very disappointing!
5,My favorite Laymon book!,"This is one of the best horror/suspense books i have ever read. Its extremely twisted and i was always dying to know what happened next. I couldn't put it down so even though it was a long book it was a quick read for me. I liked it so much that i own it in paperback and i bought it on my kindle aswell. This book was a 10/10 for me! Another excellent book to look at if you like ""twisted"" is Stephen Kings ""Desperation"". I own that one on paperback and my kindle aswell."
2,Don't bother!,"This book was fairly ridiculous. The plot was juvenile, but not completely predictable. It was an easy read, so I did finish it. The characters were not very likeable, and by the end I didn't care much what happened to them. There was a creepy twist at the end that I enjoyed."
5,Another 5 star Laymon novel? Yup!,"Yet another creepy, classic book in a series of them by an author that is quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. As with all other Laymon novels, it's unpredictable, engrossing, and a fun read. You can't go wrong to pick this book up - it's Gilligan's Island and Friday the 13th combinedYOU WANT THIS BOOK NOW!!!"
5,Modesitt at his absolute best,"I've read a lot of science fiction, and this one easily makes my top ten. I've read a lot of Modesitt's work and of those I've read, this is easily his best. Not that I don't like the others, I do, but this one is exceptional. If you want pure fantasy, best look elsewhere, this is science fiction set in the far future that speaks directly and philosophically to the here and now, as the best science fiction does, albeit too rarely."
3,Love them but...,"I bought these a few months ago from a store in town to help with planter fasciitis. They are wonderful. Good arch and anke support. I also wear them to work at the office and the ""business casual dress"" nazi in HR has not said anything about them. But the seam in one boot has come undone. I love the boots and am on line now buying another pair because they help my feet so much. I am just hoping this pair will hold up longer."
3,"""Draggin' in what worked before . . .""","If you are a Koontz fan you will recognize some of the previously successful elements found in other novels. The most obvious--the dog. ""Watchers"" gave us the most lovable and delightful canine hero. Dragon Tears tries to employ the same scenario-- with less emotional impact. This novel is more than a little far-fetched with too many loose ends to be remotely plausible. However, if you have a lot of time to kill--read it. If not, don't, or you may find yourself crying ""alligator"" tears over what might have been"
1,Worst novel I've ever finished,"I read a lot of books, and I'm pretty charitable. This is the harshest review I've ever written, for the book I hate the most. This book starts out with mystery elements, and suspense; ""How did the killer do that?"" ""How did he escape?"" etc etc.Spoiler alert: the bad guy IS A GOD. He is omnipotent and can control all time and space and matter. Well, that neatly explains how he managed all that mysterious stuff. Man, I bet Agatha Christie feels like a chump; look how much effort she put into her killer's plots, and the detective work required to solve them- wouldn't it have been simpler if ALL OF HER BAD GUYS WERE GODS? A locked room mystery? Easy- the killer is omnipotent! Missing murder weapon? Easy! The killer IS A GOD!Worst plot ever."
2,Another Poor Effort on Koontz's Part,"*Sigh* seems like I have to write more bad reviews of Koontz than good ones. When I enjoy one of his books, I love it, but he writes more than his share of poor efforts, or so it seems.Anyway, this was another less-than-well-written novel about a cop who is chasing after a morphing supernatural being who has a fascination with eyes. The novel is a long chase that fails to hold my attention. It was truly dull, poorly written, and hard on the suspention of disbelief. One bias I have that did affect my ability to like the novel is my loathing of police and books where they are featured as main characters--as was the case here. That wouldn't have helped it much, though."
2,Uh-h-h...No,"Sometimes I think Koontz is just pressed to get something done on a deadline, and falls back on the tried-and-true to make it on time. But, he has to create new incredible explanations for the impossible weirdnesses going on in his story, and...well, now and then he comes up a-cropper.This one builds fairly nicely, but ultimately disappoints because of lack of credibility. Mind you, Koontz often has pretty hard-to-believe situations or explanations, but this is one of his weaker ones, and how the protagonists find it out isn't at all credible, either.Substandard Koontz. Many of the author's books from this period (late '80s, early '90s) weren't very good. This is definitely one of them."
3,"Great story, but kind of fizzles out....","I'm a huge Dean Koontz fan, and I found the plot of this book to be one of his most creative yet. I especially loved the parts of the story told from the dog's perspective - most unique and very entertaining! However, I was left with a kind of empty feeling at the end. A lot of unanswered questions."
3,these 2 should get a room,not bad nice beat timbaland gave her the right groove feels even better while doing x pills.
4,"Started poorly, ended well","Initially I was disappointed in the book I received, however, when I advised the seller of my concerns, they quickly responded and left me quite pleased at the outcome. I would use this seller again due to their integrity."
1,What Hero?,"Very little happens in this long ""story"". It's a long dissertation about a woman named Esmay who is supposed to be a hero and a leader. Apart from the author, who can regard her as a hero? Esmay behaves as a very ordinary and plain woman. Nevertheless, her superior officers keep claiming she's a born leader... How can they be so dumb to think so? In fact, we quickly note her superior officers are even dumber than Esmay.I think EM completely missed the point. Her claimed heroine is colorless and insipid. How can anyone be interested in Esmay? A leader does behave differently from others. A leader acts, doesn't wait for things to occur, submits oneself, or simply yields. What a difference with the Miles Vorkosikan series by Bujold! Miles IS a born leader whereas Esmay is just a pale imitation.In a nutshell, a mundane and tedious book, very hard to finish."
2,Too many props,"I have this as a dvd, but it's the same as the tape, except with chapters. Anyway -- I got it about 2 years ago before I'd taken any yoga classes and started trying to do it. It starts out using blocks, so I paused and ran and got some boxes which worked. Then you needed to be near a wall, so I paused and moved my stuff next to a wall. Then you needed a bolster, and I turned the damn thing off because it was not relaxing at all. I was just pausing to go get something else every 5 minutes. They really should mention all the items you need to do this thing so you can get them ready before you start! Anyway, I didn't try it again and instead took a few classes at my university. There I learned a lot of these poses are usually done prop-less, but for some reason Patricia doesn't show you anything other than the assisted modifications."
1,Bad book to setup DBCP,"This book gives a speedstart in getting high level architecture of Tomcat 5. Its discussion, even though not comprehensive, can make you can tell the difference between a valve, a service, an instance, and a server.However, this book fails to provide a tested and consistent example on setting up DBCP (Apache Database Connection Pooling). Seems the information was extracted only from Apache DBCP website and reworded (such as replacing jndi/myoracle to jndi/wroxTC5) WITHOUT giving actual tested examples. I have Tomcat 5.0.28 running and the DBCP example mentioned 3 pages in chapter 8 and another 3 pages in chapter 14 does not work. I went looking for errata in the website but couldnt find it in the publisher's website.It is rather disappointing and discouraging when you put your trust to a book that in the end gives bad examples."
2,Didn't last long,Replaced the 25 year old original equipment ones with these. They worked well for less than a year then lost the ability tokeep the lid up. The lid started to close slowly by itself at first and in a few months it acts like the lift support is missing. Wentback to the cut-off broom stick. Turned out to be a poor value.
1,A Terrible Disappointment,"For a woman who claims people call her ""the next Dr. Ruth,"" the author has very little to say, and what she does say is repeated over and over. The entire book can be summed up in a couple of phrases -- ""Keep a positive attitude and don't stop dreaming because anything's possible."" This book is not about sex or being over fifty. It's one - two page chapters that continue to tell the reader to think young. My husband and I bought this book looking for advice on sexual desire and stress, how to deal with orthopedic issues (not being as limber as before), and other age-related problems. This book addresses nothing but ""thinking positive!"" A cheaply-manufactured book with poorly-written meager content. Please don't waste your money or your time."
4,Dickens pales in comparison.,"This novel paints a very grim picture of the impact of the Industrial Revolution on the common working family. O'Brien's nautical series described the hundreds of boys who went to sea to meet basic needs such as eating and a place to sleep. They died often in his works. Sexual harassment is alluded to but not often. Dickens is noted for his bleak portrayal of the lower classes, but the plight of the poor in this novel are even more extreme. I think that what I appreciated the most was the how callus a life could be snuffed out. It is a sad commentary on those times. But then today, we have all the horror stories from around the world of child soldiers, child sex workers, war refugees in the hundreds of thousands. So perhaps we haven't come very far.Mr. B"
4,"well put together, funny and closures on some relationships",I found this movie to be very well thoughtout and at the same time funny. It follows the relationships these characters have established over the years. I especially enjoyed Deanna and Will's new relationship.
5,Making Star Trek Fun Again,"Who knew that there was so much humor and genuine affection between the mainstays of the Next Generation cast? (Everyone who watched it, probably, except you had to really pay attention.) This selection is a refreshingly ""freed"" and less stoic group of characters who are less worried about making a mistake and more worried about doing the right thing against the odds.It's a good story, a wonderful showcase for the characters, including a wonderful flirtatious affair for the Captain, and a moral victory. We get to root for the good guys and watch the bad guys either see the error of their ways or get incinerated.Good fun overall. You'll want to watch it more than once and keep it handy for when every show on TV is ""reality."" Given the choice, I'll opt for Star Trek every time."
3,This was a fun Trek film,"This was a fun Trek film. Not the best, but the best of the odd number Trek movies to date. The cast and production was top noch, but the script belongs on the small screen."
3,"When better is possible, good is not enough","As a devoted Star Trek fan, I must say I enjoyed this film. It was the most humorous of all the Star Trek films and the special effects were great. However, it was not without flaws. The script was mediocre and the plot had holes in it. The new enemies, the Son'a, were not nearly as entertaining as the villanious Borg from the last Star Trek film, Star Trek: First Contact. They seemed more like cranky old men rather than space villains. This was a pretty good movie, but it wasn't as good as First Contact, or it would have done better at the box office. I guess the odd numbered Star Trek movie curse struck again."
3,It was all in fun. T'was never meant to be a blockbuster.,"Speaking as a Trekker, it was a good, odd-numbered film. Yes, it would've made a better episode, but hey, don't they all? Trek movies are extensions of the series. Only Star Treks 2, 4 and 8 merit blockbuster status. It was mostly a Picard-love story with the usual Utopia planet. A girly movie ending with the usual ""out-of-sight, out-of-mind"" love interest. The Roddenberry essence is lost. Has been since his death. Rick Berman has sculpted Trek in his own image. Jonathan Frakes continues to be an exemplary director. Jerry Goldsmith did outstanding score. Data and Riker had some choice moments, Worf was reduced to a mere token Klingon, and poor Crusher, Troi & LaForge were just along for the ride. It's a fun movie with funny moments. Don't put Star Trek movies on a pedestal so high no one will want to see it. You can let your kids watch it."
2,A Real Dissapointment,"I've grown up as a Trekkie and remember waching the old TV Series as a child with my father. I've always thought the magic of Star Trek was maintained very well over the years and through the various spin-offs, with only occassional minor let downs. I tried to be as open about Insurrection as possible, but found it a complete dissapointment. The story felt pieced together with a variety of unrelated issues appearing once and not being built upon at any other point in the film. There were far too many scenes that were not only predictable, but had an element of, dare I say, being on the hokey-side. The special effects were over-rated as I found many of the ships to actually look plastic, while the cinematography gave the film a MTV look. This film did not, in my opinion, carry the weight or impact of its predecessors. While it may be worth completing the collection for some die-hards, this one is waiting for the release of the earlier films."
3,As Usual,"The latest Star Trek picture proves to be just another installment of a never-ending franchise. Appropriately enough, Insurrection centers around a ""Fountain of Youth"" world where paradise is inhabited by Caucasians.The film is full of cliches that give the film all the charm of a good ol' western: saving the ranch from rustlers, the lone star in a white hat and so forth. Howver, this is Insurrection's greatest appeal: a revival of that old time cinema, the fight between clearly defined villains and heroes. Moreover, the charachters and plot are easier to follow in this Star Trek movie precisely for that reason. All in all, Star Trek falls short of going beyond ""the final fronteir"" in terms of originality, but it cleverly retools a genre that has been sorely macbre in recent years.It's worth watching, but don't expect some kind of new insight on human nature that Star tRek is famous for doing."
1,Set Phasers to stun Paramount Execs..,"I love the Star Trek franchise just as much as I do Star Wars, but after viewing this movie it's obvious my priorities were not in order. The stroy is very weak and I have to agree with others that this is merely a TV episode. I don't know how/why Rick Berman let this story get green lighted. Save your money."
1,A saddened Trek Fan,"I have been a ST TNG fan for a long time. I was The series was mature and real, the social commentary intelligent, the characters expressive and and well developed.What happened? I almost walked out! Did Disney get a hold of this?Star Trek fans, you will be disappointed! It lacks all of the good things the series and ""First Contact"" had.Don't bother. Let's hope the next one returns to the things that were good about trekking."
1,Hurt the Franchise,"Star Trek could have used a hit movie when this was released, unfortuantely we got Insurrection.I'm happy to see the TNG cast whenever I can, and it was nice to see them in the movie but that's all the enjoyment I got-seeing the cast.The movie itself suffered from a poor story. I found the movie very slow, I had little sympathy for the people Picard was trying to save, nor was I impressed with the villian.I originally saw this movie in the theatre and left unhappy, I bought the video and watched half of it and then shut it off. I've never watched it since. Buy it if you want to complete your TNG collection, otherwise I can not recommend this film."
4,Not the best Star Trek movie,"This movie did have a somewhat interesting plot; however, I was left with some questions. This movie did seem more like an episode than a full-scale movie. I enjoyed the humor in it but I couldn't figure out why the Enterprise would be involved in something so irrelevent as 600 people on a planet. Especially after the first two Star Trek:TNG movies dealt with the assimilation of Earth and the near destruction of an entire solar system with billions of people. This plot did not measure up, but it was interesting. I can be critical of this movie, but I still loved it because it was Star Trek."
4,Coooool,"Who knew that there was so much humor and genuine affection between the mainstays of the Next Generation cast? (Everyone who watched it, probably, except you had to really pay attention.) This selection is a refreshingly ""freed"" and less stoic group of characters who are less worried about making a mistake and more worried about doing the right thing against the odds.It's a good story, a wonderful showcase for the characters, including a wonderful flirtatious affair for the Captain, and a moral victory. We get to root for the good guys and watch the bad guys either see the error of their ways or get incinerated.Good fun overall. You'll want to watch it more than once and keep it handy for when every show on TV is ""reality."" Given the choice, I'll opt for Star Trek every time."
5,The Best Star Trek Movie,"From the begininng to the end, this movie stands alone as an excellent work of science fiction. The story could be analyzed in many different ways. Many of the special effects I had never seen before (ie. Data ripping his cloaked headpiece off!) Excellent DVD transfer in video and sound (makes for good multiple viewings) What makes this movie refreshing is that there are clearly ""good guys"" and ""bad guys."" Plays out like a classic western in space, and leaves a smile on your face in the end. If you think about it thats what movies should be all about."
1,"Worst Star Trek Movie, Ties as Worst Movie with Star Trek V","This has to be the worst Star Trek movie that I have ever seen, and I have seen all of them. It closly ties as the worst movie ever with Star Trek V, the final frontier."
2,What????,"I have always enjoyed the Star Trek series immensly even though it is not what I would consider great science fiction, haveing alway felt that they cheat on some of their moral arguments. But before this movie, this series had been blessed with a form of consistant quality, that makes it easily the best series of its kind. This movie simply has a terrible plot. It has more holes than substance, with none of the basic storylines holding up to any kind of coherant thought. If the movie was more of an action movie they might get away with a little of this, but not here.This movie is based on the worst kind of moral absolutism that the TV series sometimes fell into. The crew desperatly over reacts to every situation so that they and they alone can solve this problem using the brightness of their halos. Sorry, but instead of thinking that they are these really great people, if I were the federation I would court-martial them for stupidy, which is what the authors of this script should face."
5,Loved it!,"Most of my friends said it wasn't as good as some of the other movies in the series (ie, they liked First Contact better), but I loved it! Excellent mix of humor, action, romance, and futuristic technology...something that perhaps they've lacked in past movies and episodes."
3,Where is the wonder?,"Where are the new worlds, strange species and just basically what makes space such an incredible place in the last few trek films? Being a big trek fan I keep asking that and also the ""cool"" factor in this film, where is it? Trek's new film needs these things and, let me see...ACTION!!! When was the last time you where actually on the edge of your seat with a trek film? Paramount needs to give trek this and although insurrection is a solid entry it still does not really move the average trek fan, and if that is so, the average non-trek fan is left saying; ""well at least there is episode one coming out in a few days."""
3,"Refreshingly entertaining, but lacking in the fundamentals.","Overall, I would have to to agree with some of the previous reviews of this film in that it was a very ""small-screen"" production. This film could have easily been on TV with a very humorous plot and even some slapstick comedy (IE Flying the Enterprise with a joystick.) bereft of the usual Star Trek genius in both F/X and plot. This film provided a very different perspective of the Enterprise crew (under the influence) which engendered humor and even some ""fairy tale"" conclusions to some of the on-going dramtic tangents in the series. While it was ""cute"", I would have saved it for a special television appearance and not the big-screen."
2,Who thought of this?,"Don't hurry to buy this. It was merely OK, and more like a long episode. Special Effects, what few there were, were noticeably bad. The acting, though, was ROTTEN. You could see the actors trying not to laugh most of the time. Shame on Frakes and Steward! Quit directing and producing your own shows and ACT.F Murray Abraham was totally wasted under the worst facial makeup I've seen in any movie made past 1950!"
2,"It could be better,but worse too.","I felt dissapointed .I expected another First Contact but it was a not brilliant TV episode.Data seemed to be stupid not funny,Piccard dancing was terrible and the NCC1701E was unreal.It needed to be more Roddenberry and less FX."
2,"Star Trek no debe ser ""poco creible.""","Ayer pude ver insurrection y me parecio un paso atras en la reconciliacion con el interes por el buen cine. La idea de la historia es interesante,el libro no la aprovecha sino que cae en los lugares convencionales de: algo de accion,algo de romance y unos cuantos tipos con disfraz de extraterrestres (¿por que los detalles asquerosos de RuFAR?.La idea respeta el espiritu de la serie,la pelicula prefiere los efectos especiales {no siempre utiles a la historia} que,por otra parte, en First Contact fueron mucho mejor utilizados y mas creibles {el E NCC1701E no se ve real}.Algunas escenas graciosas me parecen ridiculas , sobre todo no concuerdan con los personajes.A pesar de todo las ganas de ver a TNG son mas fuertes que mis criticas y estoy esperando una proxima pelicula en el mejor estilo de la serie y de First Contact."
3,a good tv episode,"it had the effects, it has the sound and it has the action of a big screen movie. but the plot just does not live up to it. having said that it is still a good watch and if you are a startrek fan then you will enjoy it. i am hoping that they will come up with some better ways to keep worf in the movies apart from oh look whose here. the biggest disappointment for the dvd is a lack of extra features. my choice for a trek movie is first contact and i don't even like the borg."
4,Good Movie,"This is a OK movie, it doesn't have as much action as First Contact or Nemisis, but it has a interesting storyline. Worth the money."
2,Too Much Like an Episode- Get Generations,Insurrection was too much like an episode of Star Trek and not enough like a movie. It wasn't nearly as epic as Generations.
1,What a waste of money and time!,"This movie, like anything else Star Trek, is a disappointment and a major waste of money. The plot is crap and its nothing more than a big budget tv episode.Can't Star Trek ever have aliens that look likes aliens? Sona and the Baku look like humans! Klingons from other POS movies and tv series can file mail on their heads and they also looked pretty phony.All in all, this movie is so bad that it makes Mulan(which sucked too) a masterpiece."
4,It gets deaper the more times you watch it.,"I hated this movie when I saw it in the theater. Then again, as a fan of The Next Generation series, the only movie I liked in the theatre was Generations. Oddly, this movie, and First Contact, grow on you as you re-watch them. Besides the admitted stupidity of having Riker pilot the Enterprise with a joy stick, and Data removing an emotion chip that had been fused into his Neural net, the basic story has the depth that the better Next Generation episodes had. Picard shows the kind of moral leadership that we all crave from our leaders. Patrick Stewart is so convincing. His focus is so intense. Brent Spinner gave Data emotion even though Micheal Piller idiotically wrote his emotion chip out of the script. Even with some stupid details, this is The Next Generation's best movie."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES BY PARAMOUNT,"I believe that Insurrection brings back the true reason Star Trek was created. Our world sees everything as something to be owned. Finally, Picard and crew stand up to the 'perfect' command, Star Fleet Command, when they make a dire error. Picard is wonderful, and I'm happy I bought the DVD."
4,"Very good Startrek film, great special effects, good plot","This movie isn't one of the greatest films you've ever seen, but it is a great film if you are a Star Trek fan. The special effects are top notch, the plot is good, if a little predictable. The cast all recieves a good amount of screen time and most have a few really good lines. Worth seeing, definitely worth buying."
4,It's about time Troi & Ryker got it together!,"Those of you who are trashing this movie seem to be missing the point! I see this as a light hearted, true to the series addition to the Trek Universe, like ST 4, The Voyage Home. Personally, I loved the humor, it was a nice follow up to the passions of First Contact. Nice to see Jean Luc being so human! I have also always wanted to see Troi & Ryker get back to their original relationship! So, needless to say, I LOVED the bath scene! Personally, I think Imzadi, by Peter David would make a great movie! Also Q-In Law! Anyway, I think this is a fun, enjoyable movie!"
2,Overpriced Junk,"This battery is an over-priced piece of junk. Here's why: Li-Ion batteries are the worst possible option for a digital camera. Why? Because in order to extend their life, they need to be topped off continuously. For digital cameras, Ni-Cad batteries are the perfect solution. Who takes three shots and then recharges the battery? Not me. Instead, a Ni-Cad battery lasts longest if you discharge it fully and then charge it up. It's the perfect solutions for a camera. I've bought five of these batteries. I hate having to pay so much for them. Next time, I'll buy a camera that takes a standard battery like an AA or AAA."
2,Short lived batteries,"I purchased a S100 about 2 years ago and also an extra battery. After taking several thousand photos, these batteries are toast! Starting fully charged, it seems the ""low power"" icon now blinks on after taking only a few photos. Charging also seems way too fast, under a half hour (and it makes no difference even if I charge them overnight). I am looking for replacements, but Amazon doesn't seem to sell these any more. I suppose it's possible my charger is to blame, but these batteries don't last long under heavy use in my experience."
4,good reference,"This book is a handy one for bay area residents, for weekend getaways. It can also be of great use to the visitors."
3,My Betta hate it,"For some strange reason, my Betta didn't like this food. It was difficult for it to at least try it, but spitted out immediately!I feed him with Bloodworms (by Tetra), and he loves it. My guess is that my betta is so very custom to worms that he doesn't wanna try anything else. So I guess it would unfair to actually rate this product. That's why I give 3 stars, no bad nor good...!"
5,Great book for Toddlers!,"My son is autistic and this is the only book he will sit down and listen to. You have to read it with enthusiasm to keep his attention, but when you do he loves it. Thanks goes out to the author and illustrator!"
5,This bag is as advertised and is quite cool for the price,"Those who say that they can't fit their camera must have a full blown camera that is bigger than my USB powered zip drive (that doesn't fit in the bag, but only 25% of it's length stics out) The Olympus Stylus Zoom 80 camera I bout fits in the front sendondary compartment and you can shove 2 rolls of film in that same compartment and have the big primary compartment leftover for all the other stuff. The primary compartment will hold 4 zip250 disks in their cases plus the usb connector cable, with the camera in the secondary compartment. Bottom line, this is probably the best camera bag you can buy for $10 or less."
1,Mushrooms grow on _________,"This is pretty bad stuff. Possibly the majority of the small number of people who are looking this bbok up heard about it in Phil Dick's Transmigration of Timothy Archer, a fine fictionalization of the life of Bishop James Pike. The book itself is a garbled mass of conjecture, symbolism at its worst (where everything is capable of equaling everything else) and poor linguistics. Definitely NOT Allegro's best work, but the premise is basically sound, Amanita muscaria cults were widespread and there's every reason to believe pre-civilized mankind was a much more avid mushroom worshipper than today's dilletantes. The only redeeming feature of the paperback edition is the reproduction of an early Christian fresco showing Adam and Eve being tempted with a large red, white-polka-dotted mushroom in a natural setting. That alone is worth the price of this wacky book. And of course all PKD fans know this is a must-have for their bookshelves."
1,Never got it,I have no input for this product never got to me I'm still waiting to get it. It has been over a month and a half since I ordered it.
5,FANTASTIC!,"I have had this book in my collection for some time before reading it. I read it a few weeks ago, and wow, I was moved. Although the author uses examples from both the 19th century as well as from past decades (mostly accounts of people I've never heard of) the information is still just as true as ever. The author writes much of the book in parable form, which leaves a deeper message than I could completely grasp upon one reading. I plan on referring to it again and again. Excellent reading."
4,Excellent debut effort,"Usually when I buy a CD, I consider myself lucky if I actually like 3 or 4 songs on it. With Carl's CD, its the reverse. There are very few songs on the CD that I don't enjoy. A great job for a debut album, its a very relaxing, mellow CD with none of the blatantly sexual lyrics often found in today's music. I highly recommend it. I intend to tell all my friends that this is a must have."
4,GOOD DEBUT..,"Although I have only listened to the cd in its entirety once since I bought it last week, im impressed..However my cd player stays on two tracks, Summer Rain and Special Lady..Summer Rain just has a feeling to it that makes u wanna, wanna, wanna, man i dunno..its a good song. And Special Lady is the last song on the cd and a perfect ending...the music and the words and the way that man sings it is sooo Emotional...Its worth the money"
5,You have to buy this album!,"I love this album. These days it's really hard to find a decent R&B album. Trust me when I say that this album is excellent. This is an album that can be played from beginning to end without pressing the fast forward button. The songs that stand out the most are ""Emotional"", ""I wish"", ""Summer Rain"", ""Hey Now"", and ""Special Lady."" But the whole album is excellent!"
4,"Lush, smooth, just plain old good R&B","Carl Thomas' debut is very good. The first single, ""I Wish"" is an open door beckoning one to come in and relax in the warm inviting melodies of the rest of the CD. Valentine is one of those songs that stays with you and Summer Rain invokes memories of the best kept secrets. If you don't already own it, what are you waiting for?"
5,Great Small MP3 Player,"This unit has travelled the world in the 5 months I have had it with zero problems. The size is perfect, unlike the jukebox which is bulky and doesn't fit into a pocket. It also last long. Get another 128mb card and you have 3 hours+ of music - and the batteries last that long and longer. I have zero complaints and will probably buy a second unit for my girlfriend who keeps taking mine."
1,Stick with your name brands,I bought a silver one for myself and a blue one for my girlfriend at the same time. I worked fine first few months. One day my girl friend's Nomad 2 MG stopped working. And after few days mine stopped working. Out of warranty (...). Moral of this story is stick with your name brands like Sony whose been making portable audio players for forever. Creative Labs makes pretty good sound cards but they don't know a thing about making a portable box that is durable.
5,Great !!,"I bought this cool little gizmo in Asia. So I have different spec with you guys. First I've got digital 32 FM Presets, Headphone like NOMAD II (Sounds great!), WIRED remote. This NOMAD is very cool, and great. It can stored around 40-songs (.wma), and still sounds great. It worth to spend money on this thing."
1,The show is just STUPID and NOT FUNNY,Who can actually think this is funny?This is so lame.Horrible show. You people need a life.
3,A few laughs,"This season has a few laughs but it's not nearly as funny as season two, or even season one. I'd recommend buying it used."
2,bogus sound,"Great songs and performances all around. Too bad the sound is poor. My copy also cuts out completely in two spots - just blank spots in the middle of songs. Instead of this cheapo disc, buy the ""At Joe Gibbs"" set instead, it includes everything here and sounds great."
3,Loud and fast,"The unconventional form of the book - the mix of journals, zines, letters - works very well. That's no small accomplishment. Also, the characters are compelling, and it's great that someone has documented a fascinating music scene.I would have liked more. It's all over way too fast. It doesn't need a big dramatic conclusion, but I wish it were fleshed out a bit more."
5,"good price, fast delivery and good quality",My son and I am satisfied with this watch. This is light and cute for young kids. It looks easy for kids to wear this watch.
1,Terrible translation,"This translation (Parmee)is terrible. Here is Flaubert, working tirelessly over every line to find le mot juste, and I can't read a single page without flinching from some awkwardly translated phrase."
3,good for me,I bought them for my kids but I guess you can trick them ... they are not crazy about them but will eat it if nothing else is offered :)I do like them myself
1,Handyman Special,"Still haven't used it yet, but just putting it together was harder than it should be. The box was pretty beat up when it arrived, but I didn't want to deal with shipping it back. Some small parts (bolts, etc.) did not match the instructions. The handle is supposed to slide onto the rest of the assembly but was almost an inch wider than that. Finally, the hole for the bolt to lock the handle to the rest of the cart was ""dimpled"" in which wouldn't allow it to slide over the tubing.After some sand paper, lubricant, and alot of muscle, the cart is together. It may work perfectly from here, and it could have been the rough treatment in shipping that caused most of the issues, but it sure doesn't give a positive first impression."
4,Still have this case all these year later,This sturdy case has outlasted many cameras and I find it adequate for carrying my camera around.
3,Quite dissapointing,"I really expected this to be an instructional video, that would provide some of the content of the Kama Sutra. Instead it was bad acting to portray LISTS of what you might find in the Kama Sutra. Visually it was certainly aimed at men, as the actresses are plastic and implanted (and yucky) and you see them naked frequently, while the men are for the most part unattractive, and you dont see their naked bodies even once. Its hard to take something seriously when they pantomime their actions instead of actually showing what they're doing, or even actually doing it. You end up laughing at your ""guide"". I gave it two stars because if you are VERY new to sex then it might be worth checking out because you'll get a few ideas of different positions, but to those of us who've been there and done that and were looking for something to add to it, its quite dissapointing."
4,Flawed but worth watching,"Great footage and interviews. Too much focus on his personal quirks and not enough on how the music developed, except Chris Blackwell trying to justify his adding guitar overdubs and faster tempos in an attempt to appeal to rock audiences."
5,Loved it!,I'm a big Marley fan so this was great to watch. I enjoyed learning where he came from & all he had to go through to get where he ended up. Made me love him even more.
5,Catch a glorious eyeful of Mardi Gras with the McCaffetys,"Get a front row seat at Mardi Gras with Kerri McCaffety's MASKING AND MADNESS. This vivid collection of photographs is centered around portraits taken during Mardi Gras 2001, peppered with mixed shots from other years visits. The beauty of Mardi Gras is that it is all about showing off and being seen, a perfect natural subject for photography.The calm muted portrait background of McCaffety's photo booth provides a blessed quiet space where all manner of characters can shine in all their secret-persona-glory-revealed! Makeup, masks, sequins, glitter, tulle, stripes, spots, spangles, and beads, beads, and more beads! From whimsical to ""what the heck?"", McCaffety catches it for the just needed moment of capture so it can be shared here.If you'd rather skip the crowds, pull up a chair and relax with the masking and the madness in this book."
2,Disappointing Read,"I had picked up this book based on the recommendation by Martin Lloyd Jones in Great Doctrines of the Bible. I was looking for a seasoned, balanced counter to current Dispensational teaching. I was very disappointed. The tone, in my opinion, was at times sarcastic. It is very tiring to hear why something cannot possibly be a fact because ""it doesn't make sense"". The author spends too much time nitpicking details for this reason. My other frustration is that the author spends a great deal of time saying the other position must be true because a bunch of early Church Father's believed this. Not satisfying or helpful, in my opinion."
3,Good but very basic,A good but very basic and superficial introduction to the field. I would prefer to see some topics explored more in-depth.
4,darn good,"I was in the bookstore yesterday and the title of this book caught my eye. My first thought was ""Why the @*!# should I control my cursing? That's when it struck me that my language has gotten a bit um...colorful lately and I bought the book. I'm happy to say that it's entertaining, clever and it makes it's case. Will it make me curb my salty tounge in the future? Well, for a little while anyway, yes."
5,Wow!,"This DVD has only been in my possession for a few weeks and I have already watched it at least a dozen (or two) times. Watching Lee Rocker slap that bass will forever make me swoon.If you are a fan, this is the next best thing to seeing them in person. Sound and video quality is superb. Been a fan since the early 80's and I have only managed to see them live once. Thanks to this, I can see them whenever I want now."
2,Detergent contributed to hard water stains,"I used Cascade automatic dishwasher powder detergent for quite awhile. What can I say? I'm a sucker for lemon scent and a super affordable price. But I was frequently frustrated because every time I opened my dishwasher to inspect a freshly washed load, there were undissolved detergent flakes and hard water spots on my dishes. I know I am pretty thick, but I did not realize there were dishwasher detergents out there that actually removed and prevented hard water stains. When I finally made a switch to something else (Finish powerball tablets), all my hard water woes went away. Before, we had been throwing away our clear glasses about once a year because they were so milky white from mineral deposits. So maybe my new detergent is a little more expensive, but I'm saving money on buying new glasses. If you are looking for a dishwasher detergent that keeps dishes bright and sparkly and removes hard water spots, keep looking."
1,The worst financial textbook I have EVER seen,"This book is the biggest waste of money that I have been forced to suffer through. The examples in each chapter are poorly written and are so much simpler than the actual ""test questions"" at the end of each chapter so as to be useless. Additionally, the selected answers in the back of the book seem to be wrong as often as they are right. You couldn't pay me enough to recommend this book to anyone."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was forced to buy this book for a finance class. I look forward to throwing it away. The explanations in this book are poor, and as a financial reference, this book is useless. I had better luck with Google. There are a lot of finance books out there that do a much better job covering the same topics in this book. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Fundatmentals of investment,Book was old but acceptable condition. The shipping was not that good. Took enough time and made it just before the last day of it shipment window.
5,"Yes, it is Easy!","This is a such a great book that I bought 2 more for family members. I smoked 2 packs a day for more than 25 years and really believed it was hopeless for me to ever quit. This method puts things into perspective and yes, I did find it easy to quit!! It was amazing."
5,Helped me quit right away!!,"I must say I was quite skeptical of this book when I first got it. However, after reading the reviews I decided to purchase it. After all, I was spending 5 dollars a day almost for a pack of cigarettes, what the heck. As I started to read, it just all started making sense to me, and I realized I didn't have to smoke. I love the part where he talks about how when we are younger we don't think to ourselves that we want to be smokers. I know I'm not stating this correctly, but it's been over 4 years since I've quit, so I did forget how he put it. I just remember by the end, I felt educated in what nicotine does to my body, and how there are so many myths as to what smoking does, as opposed to how it really reacts in your body. It's too bad Allen Carr isn't here to see how many lives he has saved."
5,THIS BOOK WORKS!!,"I smoked for 5 years and could not quit. I tried everything to quit but it was very difficult and never worked. Luckily I found this book and the moment I finished the book, I knew I quit smoking. It's been over 10 years and I have no desire to smoke anymore."
5,Best book ever!,"This book works!!I didn't think it would be possible for anyone to quit smoking just by reading a book. Especially a long time smoker like me, but I did!!I'm so grateful for this book. I'm so much happier to be a non smoker and I know I will NEVER smoke again."
3,The Easy Way to Stop Smoking,"This book is an incentive to use for people that are very serious about wanting to stop smoking. You have to want to stop. The book continuously talks about brain washing and becomes very repetitive with its own form of pyschological brain washing. The book makes you stop and think every time you pick up that cigarette.There is nothing gory or visually explicit within the book.We quit smoking before we even finished the book, but made sure we read the book in its entirety."
5,4 Years Strong,"I have never taken the time to write a review. But this is the exception. I read this book 4 years ago. When I closed the last page, I never picked up another cig again. And with NOT a single craving or regret. I smoked a pack and maybe two if partying and had tried countless times before and always started again. After reading this book I could immediatly be around my smoking friends and go to bars and did not think twice about it. My husband did not really want to quit, but he read it any way. Last page, never has smoked again (also 4 years). The book was reccomended to us by 2 friends (heavy smokers) and they are both going 5 plus years successfully. Wanna STOP (quit my ass)? Read the book!!!! Saved my life! Good luck!!!"
5,Truly a life changing book,"I don't usually write reviews but all the positive reviews about this book helped me make the decision to purchase it and gave me hope. So I hope this helps you.I ordered this book out of curiosity and was very skeptic about the outcome. It took me over a month to finish it and I doubted myself the whole time. Yet after I finished reading, I put out the last cigarette and felt immediate relief. The first couple of days were a little strange, because I used to plan my whole day around smoking, but it turned out OK.I have more energy, feel better and even endure the company of smokers easily, without being tempted. This book is about putting your thinking in a different perspective, adopting a non-smoker's frame of mind.Try it even if you're skeptic about it. You have nothing to loose and so much to gain!I am getting it as a Christmas gift for all my smoking friends."
5,It actually worked,"I smoked for 14 years and never really wanted to stop. When I recently changed my mind about that I wanted to do it armed with something more than just willpower. I'd tried that method last year and it was a disaster; I was miserable. This time I did some research and found that a lot of people seemed to be having a lot of success with this book. It wasn't just reviewers on Amazon, but also forum posters on [...], which is a community near and dear to my heart. Based on all this I ordered the book and started reading it. I'm happy to report that it's been over two weeks since I've smoked! I'm calm, collected and happy about it, unlike last year when I was stressed, pissy and felt the strain of fighting off every craving that popped up. Try this book out if you're interested in quitting!"
5,Wow...it worked!,"There isn't much more I can add to all the reviews, but that I had to read it twice for it to ""click"" with me. Now that I have though, I am in utter amazement. This book actually works, and it really is EASY."
1,false advertising,"I wish this book were true. Unfortunately, it is wishful thinking. It does not take into account the actual physical symptoms of quitting smoking. It assumes that all physical ills are psychological, which they aren't. I am so disappointed with both the book and the reviews."
1,Little content,"I am glad this seems to have helped many people quit smoking.I read it about a week after I stopped smoking.The book has an evangelistic/conspiracy theory tone common in self-help books which put me off. The author also spends a lot of time talking about himself.I did not find that he had any new ideas. The main theme seemed to be, ""You think you enjoy smoking, but you don't. You think you do because it is an addition"" or ""Other people fooled you into thinking you enjoy smoking""Neither were new ideas, or helpful to me. Not really a method."
1,What's so EASY about quitting coldturkey?,"Everybody who rated this book 5 stars must work for EASYWAY.It did not help me quit smoking in the least bit. Waste of money.If you're considering buying this book, I'll summarize the entire book and save you the $10.SMOKING IS BAD AND FILTHY HABIT. PHYSICAL WITHDRAW FROM NICOTINE ISN""T THAT BAD. NOW QUIT SMOKING COLD TURKEY.Easyway???? Allen Carr was a conartist, snake oil salesman who became rich by putting a brand name on quitting smoking cold turkey."
5,Becoming a non smoker soon...,"I just started reading the book and I already start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I finally believe I can make it without remorse!I strongly recommend this book to anyone who, like me, have tried to stop smoking for years without success."
5,Made quiting a piece of cake!,"After 15 years at a pack a day, I quit smoking after reading this book about a month ago. It has been easy and enjoyable. If that sounds hard to believe, you really need to read this book!"
5,smoking,I have only just started to read the easy way to stop smoking by allen carr. But from what I have read so far I find it very interesting and also very helpful. I will definately continue to read this book and hopefully be a non smoker by the end.
5,MUST HAVE,"This book has helped change my life!! I am no longer a slave to the dreaded weed, and what's even more amazing is I never thought I'd be saying this. I smoked for approximately 35 years, and was one of those smokers that truly enjoyed smoking. People would say to me, you need to quit, and I would jokingly say ""I'm not a quitter!"" The truth is, the cigarettes controlled me and this book will reveal the way to take your life back so you are in charge. I recommend this book to all smokers. If you keep and open mind you will be free from this horrible addiction."
4,It worked. I quit.,"I'm not 100% sure it was all this book, but shortly after finishing this book I quit smoking cold turkey. I was a smoker for over 35 years and had tried the patch, accupunture and other methods. With this book, I was able to stop smoking without any aids and have been nicotine free for over 8 months now. Thank you Allen Carr."
4,Great!,Arrived quickly and in great shape! Even though I chose to buy a previously owned it was in great condition just as stated and was a great book!! I did not complete the book and have not stopped smoking ....at my own fault
1,"Sorry, no luck","Guy quit with smoking by a hypnotherapist.Writes same thing over and over. Nicotine is bad. Got it. But wait til the end of the book before you quit smoking. Yep. Understood, digested, however after 21 years of smoking still smoking."
1,It doesn't work,"I am dying of emphisema, this book does not work. Save your money and buy brass accents for your coffin instead"
