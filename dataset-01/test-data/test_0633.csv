4,An interesting approach 2 makin music & totally addicting!!,"MSI's album ""FGWSSS"" is very fun and different! The mixture of hip hop, some techno, and a little rock and anything inbetween is awesome! Like nothing else out there. The only problem some people might have with it is meaningless lyrics and a lot of cursing. I don't have problems with it, but you might. Besides that, its awesome! You'll never be able to say they sound like someone else."
4,Still Getting the Hang of It,"This is a nice brush, but learning to use it has been tricky. It didn't work like I imagined. I have fine hair and I was hoping that this would make achieving volume easier. It is fine, but I was hoping for better results."
3,Interesting book on Baptist history...from Early Church to early 20th century.,"It mainly covers persecution of the Ana-Baptists by the Catholic Church since around 300 A.D., and other Protestant denominations since the beginning of the Reformation period (15th Century).Written from a fundamentalist Baptist worldview."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This book is amazing. This is, by far, my favorite collection of photos. Lartigue's concentration on motion is especially featured here. He has inspired my work more than any other still photographer. Buy it here and save the dough for your own photography."
3,Beautiful,"I love this CD, it has become a welcome addition to my holiday music selections.The musicians are talented and offer songs built from an organic, acoustic approach. The album offers a song selection quite different from any typical Christmas album."
4,Well written thriller ...,"Terry North a reader and author.That says it all. I have to disagree, in that I didn't find anything the least bit amateurish about the author's writing or command of the language. Can't say the same for some of the ""vendetta reviewer's comments.""Must be some hacked off writer...Anyway, the story flows quickly, the characters are credible and so is the plot. Just good reading and in-your-face writing.It somewhat reminded me of Angels and Demons but without the lack of prose and character development. This novel has some to die for passages and well fleshed out characterization.Check this one out for yourself. I'm glad that I did.I'd read a sequel. Oh, and I'm not a friend of the author, please !!"
4,A lot of information,"An useful book with a lot of technical information and specs. Not to see great pics, neither read good texts."
3,Crabby Crab,"I was a bit disappointed in the crab I received because it did not look as good as the advertised picture. The body on my crab just looks like old brass that has not been polished in a while instead of the coppery look on the picture. Also, the tips of the pinchers and eyes have the dull brass look as well, not the polished brass look. I'm wondering if they sold me a crab they found at a yard sale somewhere. Is there anybody out there who actually sells what they are advertising anymore?"
3,Buy the Insurance if you get this phone...,"I bought this phone for my husband for fathers day... I was concerned that it was too thin and would easily break. I asked the online customer service and she said she had not heard of any problems and that the phone was very sturdy. I evne asked the in store customer service representatives--especially with all the talk about how small it was--fits in a pocket--ultra thin design ect.Needless to say, I was extremely dissapointed when the liquide crystal display broke in his pocket--the phone was not dropped--and there is no external damage. normal use. He was only able to use the phone for 2.5 weeks. We now have an additional year on our plane and we are out over $100."
5,Bosch cordless planer,"Bosch has definitely brought the cream to the top with this tool. It leaves its corded cousin behind, the sole plate has multiple v-cuts for chamfering extremely easily with this tool. I am beginning to build a corded Bosch museum, each advance in cordless technology makes corded versions less useful. My next wish on the list is for a multi voltage charging station, that would accomadate about 3 batteries and free up two outlets for me. OK Bosch are you listening? Keep up the great work on tools for the real world."
4,"""G"" rated version of Jennifer Shahade's Book","A self/family bio on how the west was won, opps I mean how chess was won! Rather interesting and well written. This book is suitable for young readers as this is a toned down mellow-yellow version in many ways of Jennifer Shahade's new book also on an insight into the world of women's chess (I would rate that PG13).The Polar sisters have done a lot for chess, helping women's self esteme and respect in a traditionally male dominated sport. However, it is a big far fetched to say the Polgar's have ""Changed the Game of Chess"". Influenced in a positive way yes, ""Changed"" no.This book along with Shahade's book are both to be recommended!"
2,Is this a zombie movie?,"Um, this movie was ok. Its only about a plane full of mutant people or zombies, that lands and attack the city.The zombies in this are obviously far more advanced than most zombies. They can run, use machine guns, and come equipped with axes and cycles. Some parts you ask ""why"". Like why would they bring up the point of shooting them in the head if they never did it. Instead they waste thousands of round by hitting them in the chest. And I think I saw the same eye piercing scene in ""Zombie."" Oh well it dosnt matter, it turns out to be a dream anyway, which is a total let down. Oh, on the box, isn't that a scene from RoboCop3? Well, if you cant tell, it is. I wonder if they got permission for that? Well, get this movie if you like gore and zombies that look like they have acne!"
3,City of the Walking Dead,"This movie hit me at a good time. When I was getting tired of the same old zombie movies (ei. Zombie or Night of the Zombies). The best part is how the zombies are so agile and not cannon fodder and how the reporter outsmarts them just to save his wife (How sweet). Ninilism at its best, gore at its goriest and possibly the most on screen deaths than any other movie ever (War movies not to be counted). The real ""Nightmare"" as the films original title suggests is that the character wakes to see that it was all a dream. Then the uncertanty that his day will follow the same path. That's a true nightmare."
5,"Foot tapping, old timey music","I listen to this album often. It feels so fresh and authentic! The first song, ""Sheep, Sheep, Don't You know the road"" is inspirational: I'll be tapping the rhythms on the computer keyboard or table before the end, and it's a great song to sing with the little sheep in my life. And I have purchased two additional copies of this CD as Christmas presents for friends to share with them the sweetness and warmth of Vera Hall-Ward's ""No Room in the Inn"" as she tells the story of the birth of Jesus to her Sunday school children. The fiddling music is superb, as well: Neil Morris and the recording engineer briefly speak after ""Corn Dodgers"" and for that moment time vanishes. You are there. I could go on. Every one of the sixteen cuts has something to recommend it. This is a extraordinary collection for those of us who love American traditional music."
4,A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings,"I purchased this CD so I could listen to Sea Lion Woman, a song I heard during the final credits to The General's Daughter. The other 29 songs were an added bonus. Some of these songs, recorded in the 30's and 40's, are a real joy to listen to. Also included with the CD is a small booklet telling you about each song. To hear ""Pullin' the Skif"" and ""Shortenin' Bread"", only to learn that the young singer died in a hold-up she perpetrated before her twenty-first birthday just grabs the heart."
1,"enough, already","This has to be one of Ms. Brockmann's early (earliest?) attempts at writing romance, updated with a nod to the internet and published for heaven knows what good reason. How many plot lines can you sandwich into one story? There's the fiance who loves the heroine's sister instead line. The old friend back in town line. The help me save my inheritance line. The cancer in remission line. The sterility line. The jealous friend line. The pretend marriage line, and to top it all off, a community musical? Pick three, and write a decent book instead of this silly mish-mash that ties up prettily with each character writing little notes to clear up the inconsistencies. Ms. Brockmann usually has complete control of seriously complex plots (in her Troubleshooters series), so this total train wreck was both a surprise and a disappointment."
1,Not her best work,"This story represents everything that I hate about romance books. The story was a cookie cutter story. They meet again, he has always loved her, she falls for him, she thinks he has lied, they break up and then she realizes (without any proof) that he isn't a liar. I have always expected better from Ms Brockman and was very disappointed."
2,"Been there, done that, why bother","Seriously folks, This is the best ever??? Substance is the best ""best of"" album to get from New Order. The music from Technique on has been so-so and this collection is nothing more than a rehash of their 12""s at best.Here is what you should do... get Substance and The Best Of New Order. This way you get the best of both old school and their newer stuff. Plus you get a couple of extra songs that deserve the recognition. Only buy this album if you have the extra cash to piss away."
1,Ugh...,"It's hard to believe with all the time they've had, that this is the best they could come up with for a holiday special. Three unfunny shorts with bad musical numbers. Robot Santa gets a minute's appearance, tops. There is no reason to spend two bucks to watch this, sorry!"
5,A Great New Season!,"Seeing that I have watched quite a few of the earlier seasons I have to say that Season 7 by far was better than Season 6, but also stands out to me, as one of the better Seasons overall. With strong writing that leaves you wanting more, this to me is the hallmark of a good Season. The writers in the series challenge the status quo and put forth some topics that would be taboo in other television series'. I applaud them for taking this stand and doing something different than has been done before and what the viewer gets in return is a great series that sometimes can be seen as a bit off color at times, but overall funny and definitely entertaining. I highly recommend this season and this series to all!"
4,"Content good, DVD bad","Our first set of DVDs that shipped would hang during an episode or skip scenes. The replacement seems to be okay.Content is good, there is one episode where the title sequence is live - clearly a labor of love. The 'extra' last episode is so-so, like volume 6."
1,They don't tell you about the 15 mins on/15 mins off!,"I was pretty excited to get this for my disco party at home. However I couldn't believe it when I opened the box and there was a red tag on the frame saying that you should use it for 15 minutes, turn it off and back on again after 15 minutes! It is also written inside the booket that comes with it. DIDN'T THEY THINK THIS WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE INCLUDED IN THE INFORMATION ONLINE????? It was not mentioned once in all the product information that I read on multiple sites!! I'm really annoyed because I wanted a product that would produce lights for several hours of dancing....not 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off! I plan to be too busy dancing to worry about timing my party lights.We set it up this evening and the lights look cool. We haven't tried it with music yet.But this product does NOT meet my expectations. I am very dissapointed and fully regret buying it! Of course it's not worth me sending it back due to the cost of shipping etc...."
2,Elmo,"I just bought this toy for my 20 month old last Saturday. I went to set it up this morning, and the cd is cracked in half. I called the company and they were very apologetic but they said that they would have to send a replacement as the file is too large for download! They suggested that I exchange it at another Toys R Us, but it will be difficult on Christmas Eve! I am excited about trying this with my daughter when I finally get all of the working parts, but I do have some trepidition about installation based on earlier posts!"
4,No problems with win XP,"I bought this Elmo for my niece for x-mas. I have a newer computer running Windows XP, and had zero problems installing the software, and downloading to Elmo. Can't wait to see my niece open up Elmo on x-mas and hear her own name."
1,Don't Buy - It doesn't work or download,"I bought this via Amazon.com for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I spent an hour and a half trying to get it to load the personalized information from two different computers. Every single time I got a ""Download failed: Please check connections, and try again."" message. This doesn't work on either XP or Windows Server 2003. Frankly, I would expect better from Mattel but it is obvious that these bozos never bothered to test their product. What a joke."
1,Very disapointed,I got this for my daughter for christmas along with the dora for my niece we spent several hours trying to download the info to the dolls. Then I read the reviews. I did found customer service to be quick and helpful they ran the lot number and found that my dolls were defective however I have to send them back to fisher price at which time they will send replacements. This will take 6-8 weeks to get the toy back. I was disappointed that until you contact customer service there is no recall and updates to problems with this doll.
2,elmo's got a glitch,"It is soooo irritating to hear people who got the ""functional"" elmo dolls calling the rest of us with the ""glitch"" dolls, crazy for leaving bad reviews. It isn't our fault that Fisher Price screwed up and a ton of these dolls & that they do not work with certain service paks or have malfunctioning usb cables. Fisher price is sending me 2 dolls, but only after i send back the broken ones- its Thursday and my daughter's party is Sunday! I'm extremely disappointed with Fisher Price and i'm sure the functioning elmo dolls are a wonderful toy- wish I had one."
4,Excellent Guide - but does not include Acadia,"Like other AMC hiking guides in this series (AMC White Mountain Guide, for example), the book includes detailed trail descriptions and top-notch maps. However, be aware that although this guide claims to include ""nearly 200 peaks,"" it does not include every little mountain in Maine (a very big state). Most notably, Acadia National Park is omitted from this book.Finally, the maps, although excellent, are paper, not tyvek."
2,Not very user friendly in beginning.,"Great product in theory, but I was less than impressed for the price. Although it is hard to find all these features in one watch, having them all in one piece is worth searching for. The problem I had with this one was mainly in its lack of ease of use. Its relatively heavy and the interface is nothing to write home about. My use was mainly to keep track of elevation changes and distance while I backpack and hike. The barometer is a nice feature but I wish all its features were more obviously accessible. The directions were not very easy to follow as I found that the watch didn't always react the way the directions said it would. I had to start over a few times. Once I initially calibrated the altimeter I couldn't recalibrate. At this point I returned it. If you are a gadget wiz you may like it but as an average tech user I found it more involved than I was looking for."
4,A COMPREHENSIVE REVISION TEXT,"This low-cost textbook, written by two experienced teachers, has become the standard for a quick and smooth revision in many Medical Schools. It harnessed all the essentials of pathology, and includes enough systemic, morphological, anatomical and histological details. Also, there are several well-designed illustrative tables and figure, which provide the needed gear for easy overview. Bold-scripted highlights are common throughout the chapters.This is the text to go for if your needs include a comprehensive revision in clinical pathology."
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK HEAD TO TOE,THIS IS THE IT BOOK. IF TOU WANT TO PASS PATHOLOGY IN THE STEP 1 YOU NEED THIS BOOK.
3,The Art of Dramatic Writing,"This book is far more than a manual on playwriting. Lajos Egir writes with solidity, authority and ease. He knows much about his profession. He writes like a very wise man. I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about my profession as I read it cover to cover.Farewell to Freedom: What Happens in Las Vegas Doesn't Necessarily Stay in Vegas!"
5,An excellent guide for any writer,"The book is beautifully written in a style that makes you feel that the author wants you to succeed. Many books on writing seem more concerned with why the author himself/herself believes he/she is a great writer. This book is an actual guide for writing. Lajos Egri has a love for building memorable characters and through the use of examples and Q/A sessions, he teaches the craft. If you want to write, this book is a must."
1,Not particularly advanced or new,"If the author truly has a PhD in astrophysics, as suggested by one reviewer, he must have a Bush speechwriter as a ghostwriter since most of the book is at about an 8th grade level.This book will help you only if you are a fantasy baseball novice, and you play in the same type of shallow mixed type league as the author. Or if you are an 8th grader.Otherwise the strategies presented within have all been done before, and often written about more clearly and in greater detail by earlier authors.If you are desperate to spend 20 bucks on this book, send it to me, and I'll send you the book and 10 bucks change. Otherwise you would be better served to read older books by John Benson, Alex Patton, Art McGee, Ron Shandler, and Pete Golenbock. Many of the editions are old or out of print but can be picked up for a few bucks either on Amazon or Alibris."
3,It's Ok.,"This sword looks AWESOME, so I bought it for my husband who loves swords! He was very happy with the look, but the feel of the sword has a lot to be desired. The sword is not sturdy, and it shakes alot. If this sword was to be played with, I have no doubt that it would fall apart in my hand. If you want something pretty to look at, then this is your sword for you! Otherwise, move on to something more battle ready."
2,Passible,"The only thing good about this one are the funny one-liners Angela, the murderous camper, uses after dispossing of the campers. Other than that, passible."
3,"Seriously, are these supposed to be comedies?","This movie isn't really that bad, but you'll get all your moneys worth in one particular scene towards the begining. I won't give it away, but it involves Angela, a senile Woody Allen impersonator, an attractive young camper, and a stick."
5,Anthony Ryder's complete guide to Figure Drawing.,"For some time now I have been looking for books that will help me develop my drawing skills. I've got to say that this book impressed me a lot. Not only are the drawings beautiful (and worth the money by itself), but the way the author teaches is both inspiring and pratical. Sick of those art books that say a lot of nice things about art but dont teach you anything? Or those books that don't teach you enough? This is the one you want then!"
4,Nice size and well worth ordering,We use betweens for finish sewing work. They are not easily found in our area so I was pleased to find them. They were the right size for the work.
1,"great pictures, terrible history","The best thing about this book are the plates, which include some nice reproductions of prints and paintings of interest to anyone researching this time period. However, as a ""history"" it is so biased and simplistic that no one can possibly take it seriously. For example, all the protestants are evil and all the catholics are virtuous. The author makes totally unfounded assertions and provides absolutely no citations or bibliography of any kind to support his claims. It's hard to find good works on Catherine de' Medicis, who has admittedly gotten a rough deal from the historians of the past. However, I would recommend anyone interested in the subject look at the works by Knecht and Strage for a more objective analysis of the facts."
5,Are you a Queen fan?,"Buy this DVD! I'm 45 minutes in and I've been laughing and crying all along. Brian going back to show us the original spot where he hung the add at college for a drummer...the original singer of Smile telling a story about Freddie; He had his head in his hands and said ""I'm not going to be a Pop star""...then lifting himself up and spreading out his hands ""I'm going to be a legend!"" If you are a fan, this DVD is worth every penny!"
4,Good beach read...,"This is a cute best friends falling for each other story. There are a few LOL moments in this book, and the characters were very sweet and likeable. If you want a fast paced that makes you smile, then try out this book. I also enjoy books by: Rachel Gibson, Susan Phillips, Marian Keyes, and Jennifer Cruise."
3,Bathtub decals,"I really wanted flower shapes but you didn't offer them so we went with the stars. I haven't actually put them down yet,as they are going on our houseboat and we have shut it down for the winter. I am sure they will look and do just great and spruce up the bathroom also. Thank you. I could not find these in any store."
2,Bull Sticks,I have purchased these before but this package smells HORRIBLE!! I have small dogs that I let chew on them for 10-15 minutes a night but I will have to give these to people with larger dogs that will be sent outside with them.
3,Small Pieces,These are quite small. I think you get a better deal getting the larger pizzle sticks pack for a little more. Most are as short as short pencils.
5,Bully Sticks,I purchased these Bully Sticks for our 3 greyhounds which love to chew them. I am very careful as to what I allow my greyhounds to chew since I am afraid of my greyhounds chewing something that they could choke on. The Bully Sticks did not break apart into little pieces as other rawhides chews can that could have gotten stuck in their throat. The Bully Sticks gave my greyhounds lots of chewing fun & helped to clean their teeth alittle. I would recommend these Bully Sticks for any dog.
2,Quality of Item,"I was not happy with the product at all. The sticks are all varying lengths, some as short as 3 inches, some as long as 8 inches. Also, they are a wide range of thickness. Some are smaller than a pencil and others are huge!Alot of them have knots in them which are hard for the dogs to chew. Quite a few of them also have curved ends on them which also make it hard for the dogs to chew.They are not at all the quality of the sticks you can buy in the stores.They may be okay for large dogs, but I have dogs in the 10-12 lb range and they are having a hard time with them."
2,Had a pungent odor,"I've bought the 12"" sticks from same company. This time, I wanted to avoid the trouble of cutting them into small pieces for my small dogs. You'd think the product would be the same, but surprisingly, these shorter sticks had a pungent odor. Previous sticks had a very mild odor which would become a little stronger when my dogs started chewing on them. These smell very strong."
3,Not suitable for medium size dogs,"My primary complaint is that the chews are supposed to range in size from 4""-6"". Not a single piece in the bag exceeded 4"" and most of them were quite thin. My 45 lb dog consumed them in very short order. They really are only adequate for small dogs. If you have a medium size dog, I would suggest buying a larger size and cutting them in half, if necessary."
3,Bull Sticks,"Great price. The short sticks put out quite an odor on her pad and breath. If you do give them to your dog, keep the bull sticks outdoors if you don't want the smell in the house."
2,"Good deal, but worst smelling bully sticks I've ever had","The size of these bully sticks are exactly what had been advertised, which I am satisfied with. However, out of all the brands I've bought for my dog, these are the absolute worst smelling ones I have ever had in my house. I don't know if it was just my bag, but they smell horrendous. After a couple of minutes of my dog chewing them, my house began to smell like cow manure. Other than that, they are everything they were said to be. They keep her busy, she loves them, but I will not be buying these again. Then again, I live in an apartment. If you live in a house, and have a separate room for the dog to chew these in, or can let them enjoy it outside, then they could be for you."
3,Dylan's Duluth Review,This is a new wave rendition of Bob Dylan's music.For the most part I found it an enjoyable listen. Some of the songs get pretty far out there while others take it on home. Bob should be happy for those singers in ol' Duluth. Keep it going kids.
4,Mi waan go home!,"Vanessa Spence paints a picture of Jamaican life that I could not help but relate to as a Jamaican. While non-Caribbean readers may find this book a little hard to grasp, it is well worth the try if you want to understand Jamaican people and Jamaican culture. The characters in this book were very real; they could be my cousins, aunts, or sister."
3,"Tough, but lousy battery life.","I love Bosch tools and highly recommend their table saw, saber saw and routers. It was because of their durability and precision that I bought the Bosch 14.4 when my 12 volt Porter Cable finally conked out. While the Bosch performed admirably under very heavy loads, its battery life was very disappointing. Under heavy use of drilling and driving screws, I'd get an hour or so before having to switch batteries. My buddy with the Panasonic runs all day without switching a battery (even after dropping it off a four story roof - twice). The toughness and convenient carrying case are great aspects of the Bosch, it never smoked or conked out, but I recommend the Panasonic or Porter Cable as better tools."
5,meh!,"this book is really clever. i never thought about brisane this way (the way that it is) and it amazed me that these events are likely and could happen to anyone! i've read the book many times and today i decided to stop reading for a little bit and do something else. i live in red hill, very close to zig zag street and didn't think it was very special. so i'll keep this short and say that i love rick's long, meaningless pursuits..."
4,Great movie.,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. A bit of intrigue, great story, sexual without the actual sex. Feel good movie."
4,Heard about this,"through a preview from ""Loving Annabelle"" and I liked the preview so much I was curious to see this movie. Now that I've seen the movie I have it on DVD and I watch it from time to time. I've followed Addie Yungmee's career for a while and heard she was in this, so I wanted to get it."
3,no real chemistry,"While the premise of the movie is interesting, there wasn't any chemistry between the two leads. Disappointing, but not entirely without merit."
2,"Tea: I believe I will indeed pass, thanks","I first saw this movie on a customer's 'Lists' for erotic movies. And I never heard of it, so when I saw it on tv, I figured I ought to check it out, being an erotic movie...supposedly.I had several major issues with the film. First, it took forever and a day (which is a really long time) for it to go anywhere, especially to the erotic part (which really isn't till 3/4 of the way through the movie). Secondly, or maybe firstly, the main character, as a character wasn't very interesting or anyone that intrigued me, nor was the actress playing her. I think this movie's faults can be put in the writing department, and definitely the directing and the casting. It just wasn't bringing the heat...or any kind of heat. All and all, a dud for me.I thought parts of 'The Piano' were more erotic than this movie, and for sure 'The L Word' series."
3,it's okay,"For anyone who views gay/lesbian films, you know it's hard to find a good one. Although the film has some beautiful scenes with vibrant color and music, the plot is not all that novel and the acting is, well, okay. I just couldn't feel the chemistry between the two women. It seemed forced."
2,"No way they said 4 adapters, but just send 3 of those.","No 4 items , they will send just 3 of them to you.Read seller answer about this :"" Amazon sometimes combines the listing pictures. I show thatour listing was for three items not four""¿¿¿¿¿?????Good quality chucks really, but picture and explanations are not true (3 items no 4)."
1,Frownies for corner of eyes and mouth.,"I did not like this product at all. It is uncomfortable and messy. Odd because I had tried it when it first came out years ago and at that time I thought it was a good product. Maybe it was just the one I got this time, but it was so dried up that even with the water added to it still would wrinkled up and not stick. Stop using it after just 2 days."
2,Took off my skin!,"While these may work for others, it did not work for me. The adhesive is powerful and took off bits of my skin when I pulled it off. Then again, my skin may be more sensitive than others."
4,Tragedy is never the end of hope,"A subdued score that clings to the soul with a lingering and misty melancoly; music which consoles in a way that wants to unlock a warm, rainy might in your heart where abandoned innocence has a chance to be regained."
5,Wow!,"After listening to The Briggs' ""Numbers"", I can't understand why they aren't the hugest band in rock right now! Remaining true to the world of punk, yet brutally honest, and uplifting, ""Numbers"" is the best album I've heard this year!"
2,In serious need of a good editor,"This book starts so nicely! Earthquake in LA, terrorists, nuclear war .....But then the problems begin. Point of view that shifts between characters with no transition. Pages of exposition that cover crises and changes and riots and chaos - and then the author goes back to the main characters and you find out that all this chaos happened in one day. Unfortunately, the events chronicled in this book aren't believable as the events of just a week (ex: within 48 hours of the Rapture, the homes of every missing person in the world has been bugged).As another reviewer has said, the events are rushed and the timeline much too compressed for believability (I have the same gripe with the Left Behind series).With a good editor to fix the technical writing problems, the series would have much more potential. As it is, the writing is mediocre at best. I won't read the rest of the series."
3,"Concise reference book , Helps if you already know the stuff","Warning! If you are like I was and do not know much about 3d math, this is NOT a book for you. The author looks like he knows a lot on the subject but fails to explain clearly how and why that stuff works. Some important concepts are explained in only half a page and will leave you with lots of unanswered questions. And the problem is, what good is a book like that if it is for people who already know what the book is suppose to teach? Some chapters are almost identical to Mortenson's Mathematics for computer graphics applications. Really not enough on 3d game programming, just brief overviews. I think you will learn more on the subject with web resources. The author may be a 3D guru but he certainly is a bad teacher. You can see that customers that like the book already knew a lot on the subject. So beginners, stay away!"
3,Purchased for my Colorado,"I purchased this for my Chevrolet Colorado, which it is supposed to fit. I had a lot of difficulty getting it to fit in the air box. I even put my old air filter back in to see if I was putting it in wrong. The old one went in easily, so I tried to put this one back in again. It was really difficult to get it to fit and I am not sure why. After perhaps 30 minutes of wrestling with it, I finally got it in place."
3,"GOOD LIVE, NOT SO MUCH AT HOME","Charlie has always been edgy, not content with playing harp in conventional tuning (a third above the key), but playing in the same key or a minor key off the main key. His vocals seem to improve with age, not conventionally admirable but like MoseAllison, you tolerate him or you don't - he's a stylist and you know it's him. If you see him in person, you know he's absolutely sincere and almost as liable to play guitar as harp and you can't help but like him. He's a true ""Southern Gentleman"" and worth following as he decides which direction to pursue next."
1,Apocalyptic tedium,"I sense this writer labored over the plot and text of this book without stopping to wonder, ""Does it mean anything?"" It fulfils the need of people in the 1970s to have a book about nuclear apocalypse that makes light of it, perhaps, but from the perspective of the current time, this book goes nowhere and had nothing to say. Characters are flat cutouts, and although the writing is sometimes quite good, the structure of the book leads to a and-then, and-then style construction. For the same experience as reading this book, write ""nuclear weapons are bad"" over a newspaper article before you read it."
2,"This book is informative, but awful","So there is plenty of great information in this book, and I learned a ton from reading it. I like the tech tips and very detailed facts. However this does not make up for how awfully this book is organized. Either someone was paid by the page, or the publisher decided it would be fun to shuffle around everything. Is there a reason why A/C Compressor styles are spread across two chapters, or could they have just gotten their own? Why is Cabin Filter removal arbitrarily stuffed in the middle of the Heating Fixes Chapter? Why must it cycle btween A/C to Heat every chapter, doesn't it make more sense to separate them entirely? I'm usually a very attentive reader, but I keep drifting when the subject matter is all over the place. Fix the structure of this book and it will be great, otherwise, buy a different one."
1,Junk,"This thing broke after a year of use. Bad motherboard, turns on but no boot. Its a common Toshiba feature. So I bought a new Toshiba Core2Duo laptop and 3rd day, the hard drive broke, returned it. Bought a Macbook, been happy ever since!"
4,Puzzling,"This sequel to ""Murder on the Titanic"" is pleasing to read and enjoyable, however it, as well as its first installment, carry voids in plot. Plot holes, if you will. It's dissapointing, because he raises more questions than he gives answers. But otherwise, it's a thrilling read, and has some interesting commentaries on the real-life Titanic characters at the end of the volume."
5,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK !!!!,I have this book and is fantastic. I love 5ive and everythink about them. Come on buy !!!!!
3,pleasant diversons,"The Chain Reaction sound undergoes a view twists in this album with ethnic percussion and quite striking melodics. Unfortunately these tracks don't hold their weight and end up drifting quite uncomfortably. The more 'Chain Reaction' type efforts, with their shifting organic layers of synth and relentless bass lines are sublime as always."
5,The Healer's Manual,I found the book very interesting and informative. I had very littleexposure to this type of practice before this book and now have a muchbetter understanding of the intricacies involved in Energy Therapy. Irate this book a 5 and recommend it be acquired by any student of theoccult. If you are a student of alternate therapies and holistic healingyou will benefit by what this work has to offer. It will make an excellent addition to the occult library.
2,The Sound of Disappointment,"This, the only widely available volume on the great films of Robert Wise, is a tremendous disappointment. Each film receives its own chapter consisting of photos and a brief quotation from Wise himself. Although some chapters are informative,Wise's comments often seem distant and non-committal, as if he were hesitant to reveal his true feelings about the films he made and the people with whom he worked. Most tragically, these miniscule quotations do not enrich the experience of viewing the films themselves. Both Robert Wise and his vast body of work deserve a lengthy biography and detailed critical study. Unfortunately, this is neither."
3,Dual emotions-Pain yet Pride at Eneas'fortitude.,"Eneas Africanus is described in this edition as one of the classics of Southern literature about a ""Southern darky's devotion to his white folks."" I was born in the South(North Carolina) in 1957. Why had I never even heard of this book until while living in Germany, my Italian father-in-law gave it to me in 1993, after having found it in the basement of his German employer's firm? I became teary-eyed at being reminded of the condascending coat that the slaves were forced to don in relation to the white race in the 1800's. In spite of the humbleness, Eneas' fortitude and trustworthiness shines brighter. It would have been interesting to have read more black oriented books during my ""coming of age"" in the South, and it would have been splendid to have found out earlier about all the wonderful contributions the African-American made, yes, even as early as kindergarten. Isn't it nice that the world knows, though it takes years, when it's time for change."
4,Like Shojuo? This books for you! ^_^,"This book is really great the only bad part is Akaro doesn't teach how to draw a three quarter view and some of the steps you have to practice really hard and long to get. If your a beginer I whould recamend Katie Coope's How To Draw Manga and How To Draw More Manga books or the How to draw manga seires but what I DON'T recamend at all is Kids draw, Extreme art, or Manga Mainia. This book is more of a advanced begginer so the steps are a little harder but once you master it it you art looks twice as good! In the begining of the book it shows how to draw a girl who looks like Sakura from Card captors! It also shows how to draw a bunch of charaters from fermilair shojuos too.So if you love shojou this book is for you! ^_^"
4,For the specialist!,"Faraone's book on Greek love magic will challenge several of the widely held assumptions about sex and gender roles, showing once again that they are not the same nor were they seen by the ancients as being the same. His connections seem solid but fuller quotations of the texts might help strengthen his arguements. Good food for thought."
3,SEZME SESAME SNAPS,"GOOD SIZE, INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED, ENOUGH TO SHARE. GOOD, NUTRITIOUS SNACK. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM AVAILABLE IN FLAVORS LIKE THE LOWELL SESAKISS."
4,Does what it says on the can.,"Very lightweight and portable little clarinet stand and one of the few which *fully* fits inside of a typical clarinet's bell for easy storage and transportation in the clarinet's case. Very easy to erect - just pull out each leg (sideways) a little, then slide and click it into place). Once set up (in seconds) it's stable with the clarinet on it. Yes, it's not made of super strong materials, so a little finnesse is required, but so long as you exercise care when opening and closing it, it should last for a long time and at this price, is not expensive to replace should you need to."
4,Way fun,"I always get mad compliments whenever I wear these out or to an audition. Straps could have a few more holes in them, my feet are really skinny and slip in them when I salsa dance. All in all, a fab shoe."
2,Doesn't' Fit *Any* Fireplace,Warning: this product probably fits *most* chimneys but certainly doesn't fit *any* size chimney opening as claimed. Measure chimney carefully before purchasing. I wanted this product but had to go with a more expensive one because my chimney opening is too large for this product.
3,Not the miracle worker I was hoping for.,"My downstairs fireplace shares a chimney with the upstairs one and I have some kind of crossflow of smoke between the two. I've raised the upstairs flue above the lower one and I've used fireplace caulk in the downstairs one to seal the drafts. I can see that the downstairs flue does not close completely and I was hoping for a complete sealing of the smoke/cold air coming down my chimney with this product but that hasn't happened yet. I was concerned that my fireplace was too large for this ""large"" pillow but it seems to fit ok. The pillow just doesn't totally seal to keep the smoke out. I'll continue to use it because it's better than not having it."
1,Chimney Draft stopper...not!,"Overall, I achieved better results (and less messy!) using a blanket covering the opening. Perhaps it's just my fireplace shape, but there is no significant improvement in draft stoppage. In the end, I'm still using the same old external cover to minimize downdrafts. The telescoping stick is too short for big fireplaces & the pillow fit is poor, plus it shifts if you have serious downdrafts. I will likely end up getting a new damper installed & the cost of this would have been better applied to that. Plus to remove it to actually make a fire is messy & a pain to get it back in place again. Save your money or get more creative with Home Depot materials & make one yourself."
4,Good but not perfect,"I recently got and installed this in our chimney. It worked pretty well, but didn't perfectly seal around the flu handle and the edges. I ended up stuffing grocery bags in any spot that wasn't perfectly sealed and that seemed to do the trick.Also note that in my case I thought the main culprit for heat loss was air escaping up through my chimney, but it turned out that it was a poorly sealed fresh air intake in the floor of my fireplace that was pouring the cold air into my basement. So stuffing that with some insulation and using aluminum duct tape made a bigger difference then this did. And that cost me a total of <$1."
2,Leaves something to be desired.,"If you are familiar with middle east cooking, this book may be a good choice, but for a newcomer to the cuisine, it leaves a lot to be desired. The directions seem to assume you have made similar recipes before, and know the procedures. You will find yourself asking, now what do I do? Then trying to figure out what seem to be missing steps. On the good side, the first two chapters have some great information on general nutrition, and how it applies to the Mediterranean kitchen."
3,Okay but nothing too great,"So I bought this book expecting something a little more interesting, but I still haven't finished reading it. I just can't seem to get in to it, which is unusual for me (I typically read at least 2 books a week and I cannot stand not completely reading a book once I've started it) but for some reason, I am very bored by this book despite how much I try to like it. Maybe I'll pick it back up some day and love it, but as for now, it's collecting dust."
4,A great message for women in midlife,"Although the author can be a bit pedantic and repetitive at times, the basic message is one I really needed to hear at this stage in my life. The information on the historical sights she visited is also quite interesting."
1,COBY DVD-237 Player IS NOT Region Free,"STOP and BEWARE. If you want to purchase a multi-region DVD player DO NOT buy the Coby DVD-237 DVD player it is just a regular DVD player. I wanted a multi-region player that I could watch DVD's from England on (Region 2). I read the reviews and other people wrote about how easy this player was to do it, so I ordered it. Well I got the player yesterday, and the player DOES NOT do multi-regions. It may be a fine little player, but it is not what it is advertised as, now I have to return it. You can contact Coby Customer Service at 1-800-681-2629 and they can tell you what the player can and can't do. But it does not do Regions outside the US."
2,Difficult to operate,Difficult to operateDVD player is OK at the price but remote is not good and quality of sound is not up to the other DVD players priced in $ 30 range.It is playing all the formats but sometimes makes noise.
5,Found it.,"I had been looking for this movie for over a year. I had rented it from RedBox and then never found it again. I thought the movie was so intriging that I wanted to own it. It came at a great price and quicker than I thought. Since then, I have had movie night and all who saw it were blown away my the mystery of it all. I highly recommend this movie to suspense junkies.This was my very first time of ordering ANYTHING from Amazon.com. Believe me it won't be the last. Highly recommend!"
2,For anyone in grade school,"It is only about 35 pages (including index, etc.). It is in large type. Granted, it summarized each conquistador simply and to the point. It would be ideal for a kid in grade school"
3,Consistent If Nothing Else!,"I always have a difficult time reviewing Tinsley Ellis and I suppose whether you will like him or not depends on whether you are already familiar with him and which of his prior releases you like. For me, I first became exposed to Ellis' music with the 1997 release of ""Fire It Up"". The music throughout that CD was a little dark and had almost a Hendrix like quality to it. I liked it, but reviewers did not favor it. Then I purchased ""Kingpin"" which showed several varying styles and was not, in any way, musically related to ""Fire It Up"". This CD is much like ""Kingpin"". The songs range from the Honky Tonk style ""Hooked"", to almost a pop quality ""Mystery to Me"" to a slow blues ""Stuck In Love"" and everything in between. There are several songs on the disc I really like for example, ""Hell Or High Water"" and ""Ten Year Day"", there are also and equal number that do not appeal to me. The CD is not bad certainly, but there isn't a lot to hold your interest."
1,Disappointing,"My 9 month old son absolutely loved ""That's Not My Lion"" so we ordered this book. The touch and feel parts aren't as big and the textures aren't as interesting. He is completely bored and I'm very disappointed."
4,Pretty good for the Touchy-Feely books,"We own about 7 of the books from this series, and I think this one is in the middle. For some reason my son is just not as into this one as the others - maybe because the patches are a little smaller. My son has liked these since he was only about 3 months old, now he is 8 months and is really getting into touching the pages. I highly recommend the dinosaur and monkey books - they are his favorite."
4,Cute,"Good book, just as described, fun book for toddlers who like to feel the story as you read. Very cute"
5,Watch it over and over,"I love this movie and could watch it again and again. Such a cute love story and I love the idea of ""vibrating"""
5,DVD For Tots and Moms,"This is a DVD that will appeal to toddlers and parents alike--it's smart, fun and entertaining (even for grownups!). It has great music, lots of energy and can be played over and over again ... with a new discovery each time. It's unlike anything else on the market and I highly recommend it!"
4,"Good, for what it is.","If you've never heard of Alan Lomax, this CD is a great place to start, with bits and pieces of several collections of his field recordings. It touches down in Spain, Italy, the British Isles, the Carribbean, the deep South, the Appalachians, and a few other places, too. But keep in mind that it is a *sampler* album. Many of the tracks are faded out well before the end of the song in order to fit so much onto one CD. Think of it as a catalog: if you hear something you like, you figure out which of the other CDs it's from and go buy it so you can hear the rest. It's fun to listen to by itself, too."
5,Highly Recommended for all Music Lovers!!!!,This sampler is a wonderful gift for anyone who has an appreciation for the roots of American music. This is a great introduction to the Alan Lomax Collection. Alan Lomax was a musicologist who recorded and collected indigenous music from regions all over the United States.I have several other c.d.s from the collection and they are all wonderful.
3,just got it today.. don't know exactly,"I always like to leave reviews, b/c I know I like reading other peoples and they are informative. Well, i Just got this cd. I have Frankie's 'No Me Compares' It is okay. This one.. well usually I have to give cds time nad hten I fall in love with them. This one hasn't done much for me yet. I love Frankie, but I don't know about this cd. Gimme some time...I haven't heard any songs yet that I have fallen in love with. but cd comes w/ more pics of him and stuff. cool chevere.."
1,Region 2 DVDs,"Be aware that Region 2 DVDs cannot be played in US laptops, TV. If you know of a way to play Region2 DVDs, please let me know (without buying anything else like a converter)."
5,One of the best,"Saw this movie years back, got so excited to ;discover; it again ..It is a first class tale with first class acting"
3,A Pleasantly Funny Fantasy,"This is a brief, funny fantasy told in rhyme, about a little girl who just can't say no to the exotic animals she runs across, and she invites them home to live with her. The story is told mostly in the form of a diatribe from Dad, who describes each of the animals crowding their home: the crocodile under his bed, the seals in the pool, the goats on the roof. He forbids her to adopt the octopus for which she has requested, and she returns him to the ocean; but then escalates the excitement when she finds a dinosaur and leads him homeward on a leash.There's not much substance to this story, but it's told in a pleasing limerick-y fashion, and the ridiculousness of the exotic pets wreaking havoc in an ordered home has a rather elemental appeal."
2,Very Disappointing,"The novel never truly reached the apex I was hoping for. The story focused too much on the deserting storm troopers and Mara Jade. Though Mara Jade is welcome, I was hoping for an ultimate confrontation between Luke and Mara. But it never happens. Maybe that was impossible given the other novels, I don't know. But, Luke doesn't do much of anything in this story and that was hugely disappointing. In addition, I don't feel it was written all that well either. The plot was way too convoluted to follow. That was the chief problem. Even the best of writers can create a dude now and then. This was a dude."
1,I guess even the great Timothy Zahn can have a bad day,"I can't believe I just read a bad Timothy Zahn book maybe I was expecting too much from Allegiance but it had all the ingrediants of being good. Written between ANH and ESB, a few stormtroopers who begin to question the Empire's orders and my favorite EU charactor Mara Jade. Yet it was...bad. There was so little of Luke, Han and Leia and they really didn't seem like themselves. It would have been nice if it had touched on both Luke and Leia losing their families in ANH especially with Alderaan being the main reason for the stormtroopers' disillusionment. None of the stormtroopers were particularly interesting neither was Mara Jade, who came off to me being more like Luke then someone trained for 18 years by Palpatine. When all else fails you can expect Palpatine and Vader to be interesting and yet they weren't either. Hopefully his next book will back to the normal Zahn level."
3,"Decent read, not Zahn's best","I enjoyed reading this book. Compared to other Star Wars novels, it is at least worthwhile. However, it is far below Zahn's usual quality- the book seems short and extremely lacking in terms of detail on a number of levels. Zahn's characters are poorly developed and environmental details are often particularly weak, especially compared to the books by other active Star Wars authors like Traviss' Republic Commando series.If you are a big SW fan, you'll probably enjoy it. It's certainly not a bad story and has an interesting theme. However, don't be disappointed when it fails to meet Zahn's typical quality."
2,Everything was good.. but too much porn!,"There was too much pornography in this, I attempted to watch the first episode and that kind of ruined it. Watch it without any kids."
3,Good video clips but poor compilation,"The video clips are excellent - some amusing, some shocking. The problem is the voice-overs they do to try to make it funny. The narration itself is good, it's the silly voices they do over the video, that they're pretending the people in the video would say.The other problem is, it's CENSORED!!!! WHY?! They show SOME nudity, but the majority of it is censored with blue dots! I've seen the Caught on Tape television specials, so I bought these to get the uncesored commercial free version, but they censor most of the nudity. It's very inconsistant too. Some scenes show a type of nudity, then in another scene, the same parts are censored! This is definately disappointing.... i paid for it so I wouldn't have to have the silly censor-dots babysitting me and telling me what I should and should not see. If it were completely uncensored, it would be MUCH better."
1,Not a family show,This is not a family funny show. Turned it off right away. Thought it might be funny but it contained nudity so not good for family viewing!
1,My review of the 1940 version of Swiss Family Robinson,"I have searched for this version of Swiss Family Robinson for years and years. I finally found it. I remember this version after seeing it as a child. It contains good story scenes that are not included in the Disney versions. Also, Disney has added scenes and characters that were not in the original version.However, I am so disappointed in the quality of the copy that I received. Most of the movie was so dark I could not see the characters. I would have returned it immediately but I was afraid I would not be able to find it again and sincerely want it in my video library. I realize that this is a very old film and clearer copies my not be attainable."
2,handy but not sturdy,"I really wanted a messenger stlye bag so that it would not fall off my shoulder when carrying the baby, this fits that description, however, in just 2 months the lining came apart. i wanted something daddy friendly, but this bag is not big enough even for the essentials (diapers, change of clothes, bottles, and formula dispenser). it is a nice looking bag but i do not recomend it."
1,Not a good buy,"This bag is not very well made. The first one I bought had to be returned because when I got it home, I noticed the mat was coming unstitched. Then after about 2 months of use the same thing happened to the inside lining of the bag."
4,Great slim diaper bag.,I love this diaper bag. After 3 Children I have acquired quite a few diaper bags and this one is great. I would not recommend this bag for a new mom toting bottles but it is perfect for moms with toddlers. I love all the compartments and the cell phone holder. I have all of my mom essentials without me having to hold anything bulky. I am sure that it will wear out easily but that is the case with most diaper bags. I have found that even the pricier bags wear out easily. I can tell you that when this one does I will repurchase it again.
2,Not as great as it looks,"I loved this bag when I bought it... We wanted to downsize a little and I loved the compartments (I need help staying organized in these bags!) and the cell phone holder. I also liked that it was worn across the chest so that it wouldn't fall off my shoulder. I have had it less than a month and the liner has ripped inside, with ""stuffing"" falling everywhere. I am going to try to take it back to and find something else since it seems that this one just isn't durable enough."
3,Average,Average book for ObGyn. Chapters are a bit long and can get lost trying to dig out the must have knowledge. No review section to help bring everything together.
4,Men vs. Women vs. Alienoids.,"Actually the book should get 3.5 stars ,but when dealing with A.E.Van Vogt i'm rounding up.It becomes known ,plotwize ,that there are a few alienoids of different races on earth ,all in a delicate political ballance. The Deeans are waiting for they're ship to come and conquer Earth.Another issue is the Man-Woman thing. I'm affraid that a feminst would not like this book. Van Vogt try's to explain women behavior in a set of actions and reactions ,which are not only simple ,but are not very convincing. This is really ,i think this book's down side. I don't believe ,notice ,that he's a real chaouvinist ,but Van-Vogt is known in his wonderfull behavioral theories in his books ,that even when they are obvieously wrong ,they are beuatifully structured. This time it simply did'nt come off right.The book is not as idea filled as others of the same manufacteror ,but all in all ,not really bad too. I would put it in the same class as ""The mind cage"" and ""Moonbeast""."
4,Clear view and powerful,Higher magnification than others. LED underneath is a major plus. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 is the on/off button is unnecessarily stiff. Makes it tough for the kids to operate.
5,Excellent product,"I was leary about spending so much for the litter box. Would it work and would the cat be able to adapt to it? After following suggestions for use from previous customers, I've found this product to be a wonderful thing. The cat adapted well after a week or two, the sound isn't too loud and there is no smell or major clean-up required. I would highly recommend this product. Thanks for making this. We absolutely love it."
1,Doesn't last long,I've had this litter box for about six months now. At first it worked great but after a couple of months the track came off after hearing the notorious clicking sound other reviewers have described. I took it all apart and fixed it. Now the bottom doesn't rotate any more. In general it seems all automatic boxes end up with a motor problem or generally don't work right. I think I will try the Omega Paw and just do it myself.
4,Broken within a month,"I was very happy with this litter system when I started it up for the first time. Quiet and easy to clean, both my 2 cats and I were thrilled. Unfortunately, our glee ended in less than a month.Since the unit is so quiet, I wasn't aware that it had stopped working until I went to remove the collection bag. What I found was the thing filled with lumps of urine and fecal matter. Unable to figure out why this unit quit working, I had to put the old ""scoop it by hand"" litter box in its place.Believe it or not, I actually liked this system so much when it was working, that I'm ordering a replacement and keeping my fingers crossed."
2,More work then a basic litter box,"Bought this two weeks ago, have two cats. Looked good out of the box, plugged it in and it was silent. I used two different kinds of premium cat litter and all the machine would do is pick up most of the solid fecal matter, mince some of it to keep it going around like a fair ride, and leave all the urine at the bottom to form a cement like layer that i had to get a wooden stick to break up so I could change the litter. The room had a terrible litter box odor from about 2nd day after i cleaned it until it was clean again by hand, which took 15 to 20 mins to get it clean. I expected more from petsafe as they design good products that i use regularly. I will be returning this and going back to a regular box, which will be a nice change."
3,exciting disappointment,"I was so excited about this product! The concept of a quiet automatic cat box was thrilling to me and this was fairly affordable. Out of the box it required basically no assembly, just a space with an outlet. The space the cat uses worried me at first as it seems small...but it was fine, he used it without incident. I only used the best clumping litter and followed all other manufacturers instructions. Sadly the box would pick and choose which clumps it wanted to dispose of properly and which clumps it would mash into smaller clumps to recirculate with the litter. This didn't help with the typical cat litter box smell that I was hoping to be rid of. The box itself is hard to clean, heavy and eventually does start to make noise. I truly wanted to believe this was the answer! I was disappointed that it wasn't and instead it's turned into a $100 closet space taker!"
4,Nice and cheap.,This little box is not expensive compared to other automated ones. Its very affordable and hassle free. I have two cats. I still need to clean out small peaces every week and change litter every other. Over all its makes things a little bit easier and cleaner. If my old box got to dirty the cats would pee outside the box. This solved that issue.Update: Had this a few years now. Still works great. One cat went blind and is still able to use it just fine. I think the low noise from the motor might help him locate the box. I would recommend this to other people with blind cats.
1,Waste of Money,"I have had two LitterMaid's previously both of which eventually broke. I liked that this system was quieter and allowed the user to use money saving plastic shopping bags rahter than buying crates. However, the rotation of this system caused the clumps to break up into little bits that could only be scooped out by hand. I tried several different types of litter and was unable to solve this problem. Furthermore, eventually dust collected in the rotating wheel causing it to stop working. After several cleanings it only worked temporarily. I only had this litter box for six months and found it to be not much less work than a regular box and ultimately after malfunctioning a waste of money."
2,Will work okay if you are handy,"This product is a smart concept with a bad design. Like many of the other reviewers, I had to make modifications to the thing. When the liter bowl turns, it knocks the cover off; There is a switch on the unit that shuts the motor off when the cover comes off. SO I had to take it apart and disable the switch. Need wire strippers and wire nuts to do this right. It also helps to fasten the rim on top of the bowl to the body of the unit. I drilled a hole in both pieces and connected them with some wire.Now, if you are capable of making these (or similar modifications), the thing will work fine.I paid about half of the Amazon price at an outlet store. But for 85 bucks you should not have to do all of this work."
2,Would be awesome if it didn't break.,"I really wanted this to work, and for the short time it did it was awesome not having to scoop the box. However, we had it a couple of weeks when I noticed it making weird sounds. Since it was in the basement I thought that it sounded like that all the time and did the troubleshooting mentioned in the owner's manual. Sadly a few days later it just totally died. On the upside I called the company, PetSafe, and they shipped me a replacement. I'm waiting for that and hoping maybe I just got a dud the first time."
1,Junk!!!!,"Used it for 2 months and sent it back. every other day the thing would make a clicking nosie, so my wife had to unplug until I got home. I would have to use a screw driver and wedge the track back on. When it works, picks up pee great but not the poo. Sent back to amazon for 50% refund and I had to pay shipping to send it back. Going to pet store."
1,PetSafe litter box not what I was expecting,"I was really excited about having an automatic litter box for my cats. This litter box worked at first-- but within days it started making this horrible clicking/grinding noise. Eventually, it stopped picking up the soiled litter altogether. It also began pushing litter over the side of the box, making a mess on the floor. I would not recommend this product, and I was extremely disappointed with the quality. I returned it to Amazon and am still waiting for a refund."
2,Self cleaning but not self deodorizing,"This litter box does what it says. It continuously cleans. However, it does not do it quickly enough to prevent odor even with frequent emptying of the waste receptacle. In addition, while it picks up most large clumps, some it breaks up, resulting in the little pieces staying in the litter and adding to the smell. (I use World's Best Cat Litter.) That, combined with it not having a cover, led to an ever worsening stink in my house. The litter box was in a bathroom on the second floor of my house. The front entrance is on the first floor on the opposite side of my house. Yet, when I opened the front door and stepped into the house, I could smell the litter box. The smell became intolerable, and I had to write off the litter box as an expensive lesson. I replaced it with a BionaireBionaire Odor Grabber Air-Cleaning Litter Box 78800-100that is not self cleaning but does have a filter and odor removing fan. So far, I am impressed with the vast improvement."
1,it stopped working within 1 month,I bought this item which worked for a month. It start humming but without turning to clean the wast I tried to fix it multiple time but at the end I had to through it a away ..what a wast of a money!
2,Major design flaw,"The box works ok. I can't understand why there's not a way to make the box run manually. That means if your cat makes a huge stink in the box, you have to wait 15-20 minutes for the box to run. Even unplugging it and plugging it in doesn't make it run. Bags have gotten caught in the mechanism as well, even when we've been very careful. No one can seem to get the automated litter box right."
1,What a mess!,"I ordered this litterbox for our girl kitty who's very picky about her litter. It worked for 3 days then it died. I haven't been able to fix it to get it working again. I don't know what's wrong with it, or if it's just a piece of junk. I wouldn't recommend this litterbox since it quit workign and I'm still trying to get it fixed. It's created a huge mess at home since it's broken! :("
2,It doesn't last and it makes so much noise it scares the cats away and keeps us up at night.,"We have two cats and thought this would be a wonderful thing for them. Sadly, from the day it came out of the box it made loud grinding noises and scared the cats off. (We are using the right litter at the right level and have checked that all the motion arms are in the right slots but it still doesn't work.) Also, it only scooped as advertized some of the time. Most of the time the bowl rotated and the conveyor belt didn't work or the conveyer belt worked but the bowl didn't move (if there were actual droppings to be removed). We purchased it in July this year and now by Christmas time, it doesn't work at all. That is only 6 month of use! We would buy a new one if the bugs could be worked out in the design."
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"Overall, I am pretty disappointed with this product for a number of reasons:1. It's not nearly as quiet as it claims. I had to put mine on a timer because it was so loud. It's a simple fix, but all that really means is I had to bypass the way the system was supposed to work so it didn't make so much racket.2. The conveyer system is a decent idea, but it gets nasty, and the motor is connected to it, so cleaning it is mostly impossible. Kind of ironic since ""Simply Clean"" is in the name.3. Mine lasted a year. That's not too impressive. The conveyer system quit conveying, so now all the litter builds up at the base and piles out of the box.All said, I won't buy another one, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It just doesn't do what it says."
1,poor quality,purchased 1 it worked great purchased 5 more 4 of 5 either parts broke or just stopped working poor quality.
2,Don't Do It!,"In an affort to save $50 we opted for this. Just think its round and only turns very slowley. It leaves small clumps of litted and does not send them up to the conveyoer belt. It's also hard to clean since its round so you cant pin the excess litter against the sides. Stay away as we waisted $100 and wiil be going back to Litter Maid. Its not worth the $50 savings plus you can order here with no tax and usually free shipping. I hope this saves some folks some aggrivation. Give your cats the best, go with Litter Maid:)"
1,too fussy...breaks constantly,"I am on my third device. The first one broke after three weeks because of a gear grinding after some of the litter got underneath the bowl. I exchanged it for a new one, and the same thing happened. Then, I talked to PetSafe, and they sent me the newest model, which was supposed to fix this problem. This one broke even faster--in two weeks! I have wasted so much of my time dealing with this litter box. Don't buy it! It's a great concept, but it is made cheaply. If it were made better, I think it would be a ""game changer"" as previously mentioned."
1,"Shoddy construction, Don't be lured by chepaer price!!","The idea and concept of this litter box is great, however the execution is terrible. Feces and clumps get stuck at the bottom of the ramp and under the sifter. I used the vegetable spray trick to avoid sticking to the base... to no avail! Pieces unless pretty sizable, do not make it the entire way up the ramp, and circle in the box for eternity. I use fresh step litter, and have not found any difference in the box's effectiveness based on the litter brand. I end up cleaning the unit almost as much as a plain old litter box. The side walls are very low and if your cat digs with any effort at all, feces and litter will be mounded outside the box daily. I need to keep a shop vac next to the box at all times. The plastic is flimsy and the lid warps after several months. Clumps will lift the lid off the base and stop operation. Buyer beware!"
2,A documentary?,"I rented it from all the positive reviews here. I was quite disappointed. It has A LOT, I mean TONS of footage from all the different games throughout the seasons, and not enough interviews. The movie was geared more on 'glorifying' the Massillion High School football team to say the least.It could've been a lot better."
2,Daisy air rifle sleeve,"Too Small for Daisy Avanti 753 once the sights are installed. I was going to use it as added protection for the rifle, by putting the rifle in the sleeve before putting it in carrying case. But could not get the sleeve over the back sight."
1,Pretty disappointed,"I wish I would have read the couple of reviews here. In struggling with the cheap zipper the day received, the metal part of the zipper broke. I got two of these for my two children. They don't say Daisy on them, not a big deal but Daisy should be ashamed to put their name on such a cheap item. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for the price but thought being Daisy brand it would be better than it is. Decided not to return them and just put some velcro on the end so the gun won't fall out when being carried. The kids would have probably been too lazy to zip it all the time anyway. Wish it had a shoulder strap, may add one later."
5,Webster's Best Studio Work,"I first heard ""See You At The Fair"" when I was a kid in the 60's on my dad's LP. I was quickly a Ben Webster fan, and became familiar with his works from the 40's through the 60's. This album is his best work, with delicious versions of Over The Rainbow and In A Mellowtone. Webster's ability to express such a sensuous breathy tone through his horn is unique among jazz tenors, and this album shows his maturity in his career. There are no second-rate cuts on this CD. It is pure Webster; it is the reason that I became a jazz tenor sax player. Enjoy!"
3,Not soo good,"It reeks of chemicals. Eventually, this smell seems to go away, but I don't like the idea of getting these all over my blankets and clothes. You can't wash it cause there are boards inside it that would probably warp. I thought it looked organic and natural but it's covered in awful smelling chemicals, so -2 stars. Made in China too, if I remember correctly. And I'm not saying that Chinese products are bad, I have had good products that were made in China, like my Takamine and Dean acoustic guitars. Sadly though, this is not one of those good products.I would recommend opening the lid and placing it in direct sunlight for a few days when you first get it to get some of the chemicals off of it. Open a window so they have somewhere to go when they evaporate. Good luck, wish there were better products available."
1,movie,It would have been nice to know that the movie wouldn't play on a dvd player in the United States.
1,The Air Up There DVD,"The DVD was as promised, brand new and wrapped. The only problem is that it will not play in my DVD player . . . on the screen it says:Playback Prohibited by area limitationson the very back of the case it says:For all of your movie needs log onto thefilmfactory.co.ukWhen I was looking for this DVD all of the others that I found were from the United Kingdom... which I know will not play in US DVD players.On the very bottom of the description on the back of the case it says:This DVD is not to be exported, resupplied or distributed by way of trade outside the EU..."
2,no title,"Except for the presence of Kevin Bacon, whom I like a lot, this would have been a real loser. There were so many things wrong. Directed by Paul Glaser with no surprises, no depth of character, a too heavy-handed Hollywood scenario. You knew what was coming a mile away. There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that's the best I can say. Oh, and the nun. She was pretty good too. The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script. Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed ""Hollywood"". Like when the village burned down. They were ready to just up and leave where they'd lived for generations. As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses. And there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game. And Bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain, get cut in the groin, then play basketball, all on a rotten knee. Please."
5,The Gods Aren't Angry,This Man is awesome and I recommend him to everyone.....he is easy to listen to and has a way of putting a message across that will stay with you.....I have ordered quite a few of his short dvds but am waiting for more of the longer ones ....I would like to go to his church and listen to his homly....Thank-you so much and I am so glad his titles caught my eye as we had not heard of him before.....we have been passing his dvds around to people we know and they are enjoying them.....
3,"OK message, bad camera works","The video documented a sermon/lecture. The message itself is good, delivered clearly, peppered with some humor ... standard evangelistic message. My gripe is after a while it can be quite a challenge to look at the screen that is filled mostly with black & white objects (Rob wears black). While Rob walks to the left and right of the stage, the cameras don't follow him as fast. Thus there are several moments that he is out of the screen. I don't know if this dvd is supposed to be watched on a wide screen lcd, mine is still the old crt tv. So, at moments it's annoying to see only part of Rob's body.Instead of a dvd, this is better released as a cd."
5,Brilliant,Brilliant! I so enjoyed this teaching by Rob Bell. He is a wonderful communicator of the Word and the heart of God. This teaching is fundamental as its what separates us from all the other religions out there. We have a God that is knowable and wants to communicate life and interact with us. Why would you want to serve any one or anything else.Good job Rob!!This is a DVD to own!
2,Curse of the Burden of Fanhood,"I just don't know what to say. Lazy? Heck these guys are 55 or so. Talentless? I wouldn't be a fan. They were on a roll after Heaven Forbid and they rode that creative wave I guess. It just doesn't seem that creative. Even the title evokes something felt after inspecting a forgery of some ancient relic; a ""lost"" work of Picasso's that just..doesn't seem ""right."" I hated Heaven Forbid when it came out, but I play it more now than my new remastered Secret Treaties. ""Rubric Scarabs"" aside, the place in my heart for these rockers is small, but precious. It hurts me a little to cram this one in."
2,Where's the former originality?,"I don't agree at all with those people claiming that this album is so great. Blue Öyster Cult was without doubt better in the early 1970's, and ""Curse of hidden mirrors"" can't compete at all with albums like ""Secret treaties"". In my opinion, Blue Öyster Cult have lost their originality and sound more or less like any ordinary heavy metal band on this album. It's nothing outstanding at all, so I rate this effort only 2 stars, close to 3 stars."
1,Yikes,"This piece of work proves, contrary to my previous belief, that Buck's guitar skills cannot make up for absolutely horrid material. The band sounds tight...no surprise..they're always great live. It's just...the material is awful...."
2,What's Cheech doing here?,"Listen to ""Showtime"" and tell me that Eric Bloom doesn't sound like Cheech Marin singing ""Earache My Eye"". It's his best Cheech imitation since the end of ""Harvester of Eyes"" on Secret Treaties."
3,Average For BOC,"It took three years for BOC to put out another studio disc after the excellent ""Heaven Forbid"" and this time the results are a bit more mixed. ""Curse"" is a solid enough album, but there are no instant classics like were found on ""Heaven Forbid"". Overall the album is a bit pedestrian. Some of the lyrics are downright stupid which is unusual for this band. I tend to like the Buck songs the most on this disc, although Eric Bloom does himself proud on the very BOC like ""The Old Gods Return"" which is very much in the tradition of older BOC. Buck treads more pop-ish ground for the most part with the opening track ""Dance On Stilts"" which I could see as a single. ""Pocket"" which is a catchy little ditty. ""Here Comes That Feeling"" is another decent one. Other than that the album is pretty average BOC. The production on this is superb as it is probably one of the best sounding BOC albums, from a sonic perspective, the band's history. Overall the album is not bad, but not essential either."
4,The Cult delivers,"2001 finds BOC still dark, still standoffish, still brooding, and still able to kick major butt. A very polished production makes this effort really smoke with fat, tasty grooves and some nifty picking by the Buck man himself. The Rythm section is bruising and Buck Dharma's songs really shine. This album is more about grooves than older BOC releases and I find it refreshing, this is really a tight group and you just can't expect this rythm section to lay back and chug along, this rythm section needs to charge and charge hard and that's what they do here. Albert B. had a killer jazzy sound and played basically unconvention rock drums and that was a huge plus to the early BOC sound, but these two guys they have here...wow...they're like a bulldozier that can go 100mph! There is Only a couple of tracks don't live up to BOC standards, but the rest are soo good, it is forgiven. High Spots - Showtime, Pocket, Here comes that feeling. Low spots - I just Like to be Bad."
4,B-O-C !,I'm writing this to all Oyster fans that forgot about picking this CD up and listening. I was happy that I did because I think this sounds a lot like their Mirrors album from the 70s which is a good thing. It's a real cool CD with a lot of variety and it rocks.
4,"Funky Lowlives, The - Inside","Latin beats come to the forefront on the Funky Lowlives' debut EP for G-Stone, INSIDE. ""Sohosun"" has the brightness of Madrid sunshine with an upbeat kick and acoustic guitar, while the title track stays much more on a downtempo note. ""Bellaluna"" (and sister track ""Bellabeats"") continues on this mellow vein, while upping the dreaminess quotient considerably with a little dab of dub. So while this is an early entry in the Funky Lowlives' discography, it hints at the greater things to come."
2,DEFECTIVE MASTERING of FOUR DVDs!!!!,"FOUR movies were DEFECTIVE. I checked TWO different sets, REBECCA is worst,making VIOLENT noise in ANY of 5 brands of DVD player. Other defective titles are THE LODGER, NOTORIOUS, and YOUNG & INNOCENT. Portions of SOME of those defective titles MAY play..but POORLY, and with Digital Freezing. Beyond that..the Design of Package is INSANE, & leads to IMMEDIATE SMUDGES and other scuffs and marks all over the DVDs. Not only are FOUR movies unplayable, but others have various marks on the underside,yetstill have yet to be enjoyed once. One gets the feeling the PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE of these discs by sucha REDICULOUSLY DESIGNED 'deluxe album', is simply so when the Blu-Rays get released, we don't have to think twice since these discs will probably be unplayable by that time because of the storage medium. Sad indeed. Hitchcock would NOT be amused."
2,3 of 8 Discs Were Defective!,"This problem may be varying from set to set and disc to disc, but the discs for ""The Lodger"", ""Rebeecca"" and ""Spellbound"" all made noise as they ran in the disc player. The other five were fine and all 8 of the discs have good visual quality. But for the first time in the years that I've ordered DVDs from Amazon I am returning a set, and I'm not seeking a replacement because it sounds like too many of the sets out there are defective. What a disappointment -- I've been waiting for the 3 British films in the set to come out in good transfers. Fox needs to do a recall and reissue this at a later date when the problems have been resolved."
1,Defective Discs---DO NOT BUY,"I can't believe the poor quality of the DVD's in this set- they skip. Last night night I had 15 guests over to my house to watch Rebecca and during the key ""reveal"" scene of the movie the disc skipped and got stuck. Even after making sure the disc was clean the disc wouldn't work properly. Long story short we couldn't watch the most important scene in the movie even though it was a brand new DVD w/ no scratches. Now I'm seeing everyone else's reviews and apparently this is a widespread problem. Someone should be fired at Fox and Amazon should not be selling this defective set of otherwise brilliant cinema."
2,"Great set, if only it worked","Like many others, I had high hopes. A few of the DVDs even worked. But some, like ""Spellbound"" (in my case) just didn't. Big shame, since the presentation and the set is about the best I've ever seen. I called the 888 number for MGM that someone else mentioned. They were very polite and helpful to me, but told me that they couldn't even do an RMA, since the set has been discontinued and removed from their catalog."
4,My review,"My goldfish love this tank. I love it too, expect that the water won't stay clean. Mom and I don't know what to do, expect change 1/4 of the water a day. I don't mind that chore, because I love to watch my fish (whose names are Chris Daughtry and Carrie Underwood). I got alot of fish food, water conditioner, and stones when I ordered this. Thank you Amazon!"
2,What About Cartoons?,"Asma is cute and that is what sells the book. It's simple as all that.Dress up a cute Pakistani girl to show the world that a girl can go out into the big bad world of the decadent West and succeed and still remain a good Muslim.Well whta I would like to know is what does Asma feel about cartoons showing Prophet Mohammad whering a bomb in his turban? What about a cartoon where the Prophet beseeches madmen who blow themselves and others up not to do it ""Because there are no more virgins in Heaven?""How does Asma feel that so many of her fellow believers are going insane all over the world because of the cartoons and are burning and looting?"
1,"American Born Confused muslim's view in short ""ABC""",I would just say that Asma's book is of an American Born Confused muslim's view; inshallah I hope she might complete her other alphabets when she comes out of this myopic view Or American Prism of Islam when she grows old with age
4,Once again,"Once again, Ms. Hasan has presented a credible and clear explanation of Islam for those of us who are not Muslims, but want to learn more about this religion. Her book is concise and easy to understand, but this does not negate her intellectual prowess. If such an intelligent and thoughtful woman such as Asma Hasan has such faith in her religion and its beliefs, I say--more power to her."
1,Questionable,"Mohammed Ali Hasan (film maker). The book you are endorsing is written by your sister? You might want to read the reviews on her first book, had I not purchased the book and Toronto on a short visit, I would have gone back for a refund. Complete waste of money considering how distorted her views are on Islam."
5,Understanding Islam and Muslims,"This book gave me a clear and honest glimpse into Islam and the Muslim world. I work with a Muslim boss and this book answered questions for me that I could not find answers to. It gave me a clear and academic explanations of the Muslim mindset. The book has very good viewpoints about Islam, that are helpful to me as a Christian to understand Islam and Muslims. This book is the best book I have found about Muslims and who they are. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to find out about Islam in-depth and about Muslims. I applaud the writer for such good work."
2,Disappointed!,"I was really excited when I checked this book out from the library. I unfortunately found it a huge disappointment. There were too many dry, unimportant facts bundled up with some tolerable information. I really wanted to learn so much more from this book. I definitely know more now than before I ventured into reading it, but I just expected a greater deluge of knowledge. I'm relieved that I checked it out before I bought it."
1,Dumb and Dumber,"There's a reason why no reputable publication in America is carrying the shoddy and juvenile work of John Cox. It's shameful. And ignorant. It reminds me of the ""funny"" cartoons racists drew years ago designed to create hatred of Blacks and Jews. This crass and offensive garbage talks down to people and assumes we're all as clueless and afraid as the author is. There's nothing in this book except fear, mendacity and virulent anti-Americanism. Does this man have a mother? Or children? If so, how does he face them knowing what he's done? If I could give a rating lower than 1 star, this trash would merit it. This man gives ""conservatives"" everywhere a bad name by reinforcing the worst stereotypes of their beliefs and actions."
5,Awesome,Don't pass this up on baja bobs website. It is amazing!!! I've tried several items by baja bob and so far they have all been good.
4,"Good Morning, Gorillas","I've been reading the story Good Morning, Gorillas. I give this book 4 stars because it's pretty funny. The book is about Jack and Annie who wanted to stay with the gorillas but they couldn't. If you like gorillas or stories about Magic Tree House, you should try this book.Clark age 7Somerset County Maine"
2,"No Code, same as what is at java.sun.com",I was really disappointed in the book because I wanted to get the source code. I had expected to get some more useful tools. A major part of this book is already on the java.sun.com website. A real waste of money if you are already familiar with design patterns and have gone to the java.sun.com website and seen these design patterns explained there.
3,"Great action, crummy style","Payne Harrison tries to bury this book beneath fifth-grade level prose. Luckily, he fails... barely. 'Thunder of Erebus' is a fine, rollicking, action-packed military adventure novel. The premise - WWIII fought on the Antarctic continent - is intriguing, if a little far-fetched. The attack on the Russian carrier Tblisi is brilliant. In fact, every military confrontation in this novel is riveting. Unfortunately, Harrison's idea of character description would be more at home on a Hollywood casting couch. Can't you show me what a character's physical attributes are without describing them in a 400-word paragraph? If the author put half as much thought into the style of his narrative as he did into the choreography of the warfare, 'Erebus' would be a 4- or 5-star novel."
1,Be prepared?,"I bought this lugnut wrench earlier this year in order to be prepared for my next flat tire, since lug nuts are now tightened by mechanics using air-compressor-driven wrenches, and I find it impossible to loosen them with a standard lug wrench. The first time I had a flat tire and needed to use this wrench--at night in a cold, relentless rain--the wrench's round, disk-like gearbox snapped in half."
3,"Chilling, yet ultimately frustrating","Invisible Darkness, is THE book about the Homolka/Bernardo case- so far. It offers background and insights that no other author approaches. It is obvious to the reader that admit it or not, author Williams has seen the infamous tapes. That being said, Williams writing is uneven and non-linear. Could it have to do with the French translation? Too many non-important characters. Too much jumping back and forth in time. Not enough quotes. Good, but the definative book is yet to be written."
5,Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men & women?,"There are many photos in this updated version of Stephen Williams' excellent true crime book. The photos, showing the ostensibly ""charming couple,"" illustrate how deceiving ""looks"" can be. This is an engrossing but stomache-churning account of the Canadian gruesome duo - with abundant detail. Details such as: Karla's favourite book was American Psycho. But in Mr. Williams' book, one also learns that, although more publicized, the United States of America isn't the only country with psychos!"
3,Detecting the Fakes,Covers basic information on detecting fakes. If the pictures were in colour it would help a lot more as some fakes have different colours. Overall an alright book for beginners. There are a lot more higher quality fakes out there that this book doesnt cover.
5,Excellent reference for beginners,"This book is well-written and very easy to follow. It is a comprehensive learning tool for those new to WordPerfect, presenting material in a way that will make the learning curve much less steep.I only wish books like this had been around when I first started learning word processing, twenty years ago. (Most software manuals then were written by the same people who coded the programs, and most of those had few of the skills that are evident in Laura's books.)When you finish ""Absolute Beginner's Guide to WordPerfect 12"" you should have learned enough to advance from ""Beginner"" to ""Intermediate"" status!"
3,Word perfect for dummies,"Good instructions, but it's very difficult to hold the pages open to follow the instructions. Had to copy pages and then put them in a binder that would stay open."
3,Good Tape,This tape is really good for holding down cables. I like hosa better as it's a little more sticky but this stuff is good as well. Good price for the amount you get with a 3in thickness.
2,Lower quality than purchased at a local AV supply store,I bought this to save a few dollars per roll compared to what the local AV supply store charges. My first reaction was that it seemed like an even better deal than first thought - the roll is frickin' huge! But then we got on site to our conference and it became apparent that this is a lower grade of gaffers tape than we're used to. It was workable but just didn't stick to the floor as well as it should have.
1,Not gaffer tape,"I purchased this because I needed gaffer tape for a job and with my Prime membership could get it in 2 days. Not really sure what this stuff is, but it is not gaffer tape. I'm sure there is probably some application this is perfect for, but none that I know of. I guess I can tape boxes with this. It holds very poorly on carpet, and left major residue on the side of a desk where it was attached for 5 days. Definitely not gaffer tape."
4,Coastal Eddie,I go through a lot of gaffers tape. I use it to tape down cables on carpet surfaces to prevent people from tripping. This product was considerably cheaper than the other brands but the specs looked good. I just recieved my tape in and I must say I'm pleased with it. The only minor con I can pick on is that the product comes wrapped in a cellophane cover which is a pain to remove.
5,Good price!,It's tape... what more can you say! The only comment I could add is that this is a very good price on the amount you're getting. This is a must have for sound and lighting gigs and doesn't leave that sticky residue like duck tape does.
4,"Good, small grinder","Nice machine -- small and hand-held; not the best solution for large floors. The grinding disk that comes with the machine is very aggressive, and it is easy to tilt the machine slightly, gouging the surface you are grinding. Less aggressive disks are available. Another relatively minor gripe is that the vacuum hose regularly slips out of the connector, sending dust and particles everywhere. You'll need knee pads for grinding on floors, and it's tough on the lower back. Excellent for small/medium jobs, with plenty of power."
2,NOT SO GREAT,"I recently purchased this product and i found the motor power to belacking and the tweezer heads dont work as well as the emjoi ap99 aka optima gold. The price for these two items are the same so if u want the best for the same money, dont get this one , get the AP99 MODEL INSTEAD."
1,Incompatible junk,"Bought the streetfinder / Navman e series for laptop combo only to find you have to be online to plan a trip. So bought this streetfinder / tripmaker package. Now I can plan a trip but the tripmaker software doesn't recognize the gps and you can't use the map in streetfinder which does recognize the gps. Called tech support and was basically told they know all about it, are just as frustrated as me but can't get any answers on future upgrades from anyone internally. In fact he sounded absolutely unhappy with the number of calls he has to take and have no answer for. Lousy products with on upgrades in sight."
1,What a waste of my hard earned money!,"Microsoft Streets & Trips is much easier to use, more flexible in planning routes and does not require access to the internet to get turn-by-turn instructions. I'm very disappointed in this product."
5,Can't wait to go!,"As promised, this is an ""insider's guide"" to all things Kauai. While the Fodor's version is quite good (better than most Fodor's), this one gives you a real feel of what to expect and what to look for when traveling to the island. Can't beat the price, either."
5,"The best, read it, use it, believe it!","We have been going to Kauai for 15 years and know this island well. However we always get the newest edition of Lenore's book. The restaurant reviews are indispensable, beach guides essential and hotel and all other activity and shopping evaluations invaluable. You will need no other guide for your trip to the very lovely, peaceful and gracious island of Kauai. Aloha.Karen and Mark Maher Portland OR"
5,The Best Kauai Travel Guide,"I found out about this book on the Internet, and am I ever glad I did. This is an excellent book completely devoted to Kauai, the most beautiful of the Hawaiian islands. The book is written with the wit and honesty that only someone who knows Kauai intimately can have. And unlike the short ""blurbs"" most travel guides provide, this guide gives extremely detailed descriptions of beaches, restaurants, and activities. I am about to visit Kauai for the second time, and I feel much better prepared now that I have read Lenore Horowitz's wonderful book"
5,Don't leave home without it!,"This book made our vacation! The most recent printing of the 16th edition (2003) was up to date and right on target with its helpful suggestions and comparisons on prices. We found wonderful, less-publicized companies, like Makana's boat tours, owned by people born and raised on Kauai as well as the well publicized hawaiian institutions, like Jack Harter Helicopters. What a difference it made to have Lenore as our guide! Not only did we enjoy her recommended activities (and pack more into one week than we could have imagined), but her restaurant reviews ere exceedingly helpful -- particularly Kintaros and The Bull Shed. Do not leave for Kauai without this book."
2,Poorly organized introduction to a beautiful island,"Although this book was written by someone with a great love of the island, I think a person would have a hard time forming an impression of the island from this book. More space is dedicated to restaurant reviews than to things to see and do. There is also no even brief background history of the island. Also this book has more exclamation marks than any book I have ever read in my life. After a while it becomes so tiresome when almost every sentence ends in an exclamation mark. Call me picky, but a book also has to be readable."
2,Not so underground,"I was expecting to read about all the hidden spots, but this is mostly just a restaurant guide. Not the first person account with great recommendations that I expected. It has a lot of general information, but no underground info such as which beach is great because of certain characteristics, no recommendations on helicopter tours- just a small section that describes what a beach is and what a helicopter tour is."
2,Underground dated,"I have been traveling to Kaua'i for 20 years and this is a great guide book if you went 10 years ago. I found the information on restaurants to be dated (They're not good forever - things change), the pictures old, and the information in general to need updating, badly. Try the Ultimate Kaua'i Guide for a more recent take."
2,"Good History, Bad Guide","If you are looking for some good background on the history of Kauai then this is the book for you. If not, and you are like most first time visitors to the island, skip this book and opt for another."
3,This book is so-so...,"The best part of this book is the ""free"" cd that comes with it. Love Keali Reichel's tunes! Having been to Kauai several times I can say that there is nothing new in this book. Directions to locations are not so great, and most of the info sounds like advertisemnets for their friends' businesses. Stick with the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook if you are only gonna buy one guidebook for the island."
2,a waste of money,"We spent a week in wonderful Kauai last spring. We had bought this so-called ""underground"" guide and the Kauai Trailblazer. There didn't seem to be any info in the underground guide that we couldn't find in the several magazine-type giveaway guides available practically anywhere; we left it behind after day 2. Trailblazer, on the other hand, described many places off the beaten path that gave us an authentic experience of the island - minus the tourist crowd, the glitz, and the money-sucking traps found in the usual guides. We borrowed a Fodor's one day - it seemed comprehensive - we'll refer to it on our next visit."
2,Not so awesome....,"I've been to Kauai a couple of times, and have used a bunch of different guides, and I feel pretty lukewarm about this book. First and foremost, there is nothing ""underground"" about it. It focuses primarily on beaches and restaurants-- and doesn't uncover anything special. There are no hidden gems, no special hikes, etc. Also, my main gripe is that the author presents _no_ opinions about the places she reviews (isn't that the purpose of a review?). Especially annoying in the restaurant section-- there was no evaluation of food, service, decor, etc. That said, however, the book did have blurbs about almost every restaurant we found.... so it was thorough. If you're really looking to explore kauai, check out the Ultimate Kauai Handbook."
2,Pooh doesn't know my kid's name,"I have a daughter, Lucy. That's a pretty common name. However Pooh isn't programed with that one. He knows a lot of names that I've never heard of, but is missing quite a few common ones. The customer support for this error is poor. I also had the download issues that the other customers reported even though I am using XP. I had high hopes for this toy after its write-up in Time, but I was very disappointed and am returning it."
4,addendum to prior review,"Well, I took the doll to work with me and used a 2000 sp4 test box to download the data to. It worked with no issues. The doll itself is extremly soft and will surely be a long time friend to my daughter.I would have given it 5 stars but the issues with XP sp2 and the lack of customer support regarding this issue drops it down. I also would like to know who came up with the meal choices for kids. Neither hotdogs or chicken nuggets are listed for any of the meals. Maybe I am a cruddy Dad who feeds my kid bad food, but i have never met a kid who didn't like hotdogs or chicken nuggets. Oddly enough, crumpets is listed as a meal choice. Hopefully there will be a way to update the software in the future."
1,Disappointed with name list,I had to return this product for my son because I couldn't get his name which is unique. If they make a product they should have something on it to make unique names by typing it in if it's not on the list. I mean there are more and more unique name sout there and there sure will be more. If i was a rich person I am sure I could have had one made just for him. Get witht the real world people and make things so unique people can have things too.
1,Pooh does not know COMMON names!!!!,"My Mom bought this to give to my son for Christmas. We sat down at the computer yesterday to get everything uploaded, etc. So I load up the software, go to select my son's name and there is no NATHANIEL - only Nathan, no Nate even! There are 15,000 names, most of which I have never heard of and Nathaniel isn't one of them? Makes no sense. So beware, even if you think your child has a ""normal"" name, Pooh may not know it!"
1,Pooh is has severe problems!,"Just received this doll for my daugher for Christmas and thought I would program early so she could play with it right away. Ugh! Kept telling me download failed, so we tried a different USB cable to see if that was the problem. It still said download failed. Pressed the button anyway to see if it would play and he said his little phrase to squeeze his hand. Well when I squeezed his hand he said Hello and cut off. Pressed the hand again and he says the same exact phrase as when you press his tummy. I can't get him to say anything else. It also has this scratchy sound when he talks. Well, this doll will need to go back. No point in even giving it to her because I will have to take it back and she will be waiting several weeks for a new one."
3,Battlefield Detectives,Just love the series but why don't they justcharge us 100 bucks for the set. Talk abouta rip-off.mn
1,Awful!,"First off, once the batteries were put in, the cover no longer fit. Secondly, the thing is louder than a jet engine. Thirdly, it doesnt work effectively and it hurts. There is no way that the woman in the commercial has it on when she puts it up to her face. It left blotches of hair along with red bumps on my skin."
3,"Not quite as effective as advertised, but not bad.","The Tweeze does pull hairs, but it doesn't get every one you can feel, like their advertisement says. If they are very short, it doesn't grab them, and going over the same spot too much just irritates the skin. It does hurt a bit, but no more than tweezers."
1,Not Worth It,"1) Painful, but that is expected2) Does not get every hair3) Sometimes breaks hairs at the skin rather than pulling from root4) Had to go over the same spot more than 25 times to get most hairs and even then there was still hair there5) Left sore red bumps in places where hair was pulledThe idea behind this product is very good. It still has a long way to go before it's near perfect and right now is nowhere near that. There are other razors like this available that are bigger and maybe they work better than this one does since there are more tweezers built in. I paid $20 for this model and I just can't see myself spending 80 bucks or more on the bigger ones when this particular model is as bad as it is to begin with.If it works for you, then I'm happy for you. It doesn't work for me, so it's back to shaving and waxing. :)"
3,works ok,"works ok, batteries are not so short-last.... but it doesn't eliminates all the hairs.... only most of them... but it's usefull if you have to travel or doesn't have a lot of time to remove the hairs"
2,don't believe the lies,"It says it doesn't hurt, but it hurts. It's like tweezing hair just faster, and yet slower than waxing... not worth it! If I plan to deal with the pain, I'd rather do it quickly and wax."
3,"It's OK, but doesn't last for years...","I have owned three Tweeze Tweezers, but all of them have stopped working now after several years of use. Since I couldn't find it in the stores after a thorough search, I decided to look on Amazon and found it, but I might try another epilator from Amazon instead of buying this product again. It removes hair very well on the upper lip and chin area, but the hair has to be long enough for the device to grab it. It's not good for underarms, and I didn't use it on my legs because I didn't want to run out of batteries just to do my legs which take longer. I found I needed to go over and over the same hair on my legs but the device didn't remove it that well, maybe my leg hair wasn't long enough. Additionally, when the batteries run low it doesn't go at full speed, so it doesn't have enough power to pull the hair out. The bottom line is at this price it's good for facial hair removal, but that's all."
1,Hair removal torture,"This review first said: ""I used this product only one time, and I'll never use it again. It tore out all the hairs from my chin, sure, but the swelling and scabbing as a result is something I'll never forget. It was also very painful while it was extracting hair. I'll just go back to my trimmer/tweeze method to keep them away as best I can.""Then I read a review by marys mom who suggested to lightly dab the problem areas instead of running straight across the skin and decided to give it another try. This time I found the procedure much more bearable and not the degree of irritation I felt the first time. My only wish now is that the instruction pamphlet would make that same suggestion as the hair removal is remarkably effective...thanks marys mom!!!"
1,keep your tweezers,"I have an Emjoi Silken Rechargeable Hair Remover and love it for facial hair removal but decided to get the emjoi tweezer for that ""single hair tweezing"" on the chin area.....sadly, it is absolutely worthless for those more coarse hairs. Bottom line, keep your tweezers for individual hairs and go for a larger emjoi product for hair removal for the upper lip, etc."
2,Horrible morning after results,"I bought the tweeze at a local drug store, and was initially quite amazed. I washed my face first, and then began to tweeze. I removed all my hair on my chin and begining of my neck area. My skin was finally smooth and hairless, a little sore but great results, or so I thought. The next morning I woke up with razor bumps like I had shaved, which are even more embarrassing then the hair. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE OF A DARK COMPLEXION, ie African American or have curly/kinky/really wavy hair. What I thought was a great inexpensive solution turned about to painfull mistake."
2,Not for guys,"I am in the military and was figuring out ways to get out of shaving everday to conform to military standards.I was looking at waxing options and bought this instead.For thicker hairs like I have, this sometimes comes in and pulls on the hair, causes the pain, but leaves it safely intact still on my face.It just doesn't do the job in my case haha."
1,It looked like it could be helpful,"I didn't work for me. I still have to ask someone to pick my ears. Since my hair is thick, the spot bleeds after a pull from that machine. Too much work and stress for nothing."
3,NCAA Youth Football,"Football was not fully pumped when I received it.Also did not have pin to pump it up - luckily I had one for basketballBall does not hold air very well, after pumping and playing few times needed more airOverall material, size is good for kids.just wish it shipped fully pumped and held air in better for longer time3 stars"
3,I think football is ok.,Football my brother hates. And My least favorite Sport: baskball.This football costs hundreds of dollars !Of couse you don't have that much money! Your choose : Play video games all day or exersize or sit there watching pepoel throw balls (FWI That's go to a football game .) A good exersize tool. I am not a big fan of sports.You hit order than you have a 100 dollar bill to pay unless your a kid or teannger.
5,It's a football,"What else is there to say about it? It's a football, it's shaped correctly, and comes with the ability to be thrown. Also caught."
4,Overall satisfaction,"I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas. The tackified surface really helps you get a grip on this ball. Thought it would be a good product for him to learn how to throw a football. Will not prepare for the slick feel of an official leather football, but good to learn the basic fundamentals of slinging the pigskin."
2,Not Impressed- Football was frayed,"I ordered this football for my 9-year old son, as it is the perfect size for him to practice in the backyard with his dad. I was so disappointed when we got it. It was frayed on the ends, and the material felt like it had a cheap wax coat over it. Also the ties weren't completely placed correctly. Needless to say, we shipped it back right away, and went with a better, slightly more expensive brand. The few extra dollars was worth the hassle. I defiantly wouldn't recommend this."
3,Only visible in very dark part of yard,"It is made well, except that it claims you can shorten the length by taking out a section of the rod and putting the stake point on the end of the shortened rod. I can't get the point to come off so this garden light towers at about 5 feet. Also, it needs COMPLETE sunlight all day in order to light up at night. Plus, unless you have this in the darkest part of your yard at night, where no other light lights up that section of yard, you won't see it light up very much at all. It's pretty dim, even fully charged. I will say that it is well made and sturdy and the glass is beautiful. Even during the day it is very pretty to see."
2,Not the book for domestic adoptive parents,"My Husband and I are hoping to adopt domestically from the foster care system and I thought this would be a good inspirational book to read. I was dissapointed to find hardly any tales of domestic adoption, especially of older children in foster care. These are nice, heart warming stories but not inspirational for someone in my situation. I believe anyone who adopts a child where ever they are is doing a wonderful thing, but it would have just been nice to see a little more balance in this book. There are so many children in this country waiting for forever families. I would encourage anyone considering foster adoption to give these kids a chance as well as internationally born infants."
3,Size matters,"Baker makes one rather basic but essential point in his book discussing the differences between the two chambers of Congress: the small size of the Senate compared to the House makes it a distinct, more generalist, and more elite body. Journalists understand this, lobbyists understand this, and congressmen themselves understand this, argues Baker. His argument is convincing, even if he relies too heavily at times on senators who previously served in the House. Yes, these individuals are uniquely qualified to discuss the processes and the interaction of members, but are they not also pre-disposed to consider the Senate a more prestigious body? This is a minor quibble. In all, House and Senate will teach the reader about the distinctions between the two bodies. In doing so, it tells the layman much about how the legislative branch of government really works."
4,Sonin 50210 14% - 20% Moisture Test Tool,An excellent bargin. This tool is great for the average home inspector or contractor. It does not give you the actual % of moisture but will tell you wether a stain is wet or dry. This is ideal for crawl spaces and attics where you have one hand on a flashlight and the meter in the other. Plus the leds make it easy to read in those dark place inspectors go.
2,Somewhat poor design hinders handy product,"Two design flaws hinder this product: The test button is too easily depressed. I kept this in my work bag and the battery was drained within two-months. Second, the test light may still work with low battery power, leading you to believe the sensor is broken when the red lights don't work. I almost threw it away, since it was only $15.00 + shipping. Dri-Eaz WetCheck was more durable, but a little more expensive."
2,Abrupt ending,"A 61 year man, facing forced retirement from the shipyard, decides to open up a restaurant. The story meanders around his relationships with his ex-wife and their kids, and his girlfriend and their one daughter. The story is engaging and reaches a crescendo with the opening of the restaurant and then just ends. There is no denouement, which makes the story pointless."
1,Curious,"I am curious why the kindle uploaded the 1995 edition of ""Rediscovering Pastoral Ministry"" instead of 2005. I'd love to buy the upgraded one not the old one."
3,not what i expected,"it does fit it's name ""mini"" but it just doesn't work that well. it leaves a lot of ingrown hairs. can anyone give me any tips as to how to use this product for full effect?"
5,I really like it!,"I've been Brazilian bikini waxing myself for about 4 years now so I'm not new to the pain of hair pulling. (I shave my armpits and legs) With that said I wanted something a little bit ""neater"" than using wax. The small size of this interested me. Thought I'd give it a try. I got it, took a nice long bath and went to work on my girlie part. I did trim the hair fairly short as I had heard the hairs can pull and break off if too long before using. Yes it hurt. But I got used to of it fairly quickly. Made sure I exfoliated the day before and a few days after to help prevent ingrown hairs. Also did my armpits and today, my legs. I would have to say the pain was greater with my legs. I'm not a hairy person. My mom is Japanese and we just don't have too much body hair which I'm grateful for :)I love that it takes a much shorter time and less mess than waxing. Also like that it can travel.Very happy with my purchase and glad to rid myself of wax and a razor."
5,"A man who loves the ""woman's"" diamond ice","I bought a few of these out of the [...] bin before I went out for a round. I must say I noticed how soft they felt, yet how far and pretty straight my drive was. Being confident I was able to get a good hit out of the fairway, and again it felt really good. Not only that, but I don't have very good sight, and am supposed to wear glasses (not a very strong prescription at all), but I could really see these balls as they were flying even as I was playing twilight rounds. And they look sweet! Something about the clear coating that looks really cool, helps you relax and have confidence.I just bought an assorted 50 count of them. I just have to find a way to play the pink ones without my friends noticing. Maybe I am due for some solo rounds..."
2,"This product is ok, not great","The product is certainly inexpensive, but you get what you pay for here. it is rather inflexible, so if you require it to be flexible in any way, it isnt. our door is slightly higher than the floor, which makes this product only modestly effective."
2,Buttons shot,"Bought this thing 4 years ago and a year ago, the on button and equals button are partially non responsive. Didn't use it all that much."
2,Garbage,"Winter Heat for the Sega Saturn is a better game. Heck, ski jumping on that game for the Commodore64 was better than on this game. Avoid. Run away. It's not worth $20. It's not worth $5."
5,"compilation is well worth it, even if you have the original cds","This is a great record, even if, or especially if, you already have the three cds which the songs on this one are from. There are several unreleased tracks, and all of the previously released tracks have been re-recorded, not just remastered, and they sound significantly more fleshed out, with deeper layers of sound and richer tonalities. In several cases, the versions are very different from the originals, as well. The tracks are also ordered effectively, so that the album flows and works well as a whole. In other words, this is a cd that a Diary of Dreams fan would really appreciate."
1,Poor quality,I liked this bag until the lining ripped. I exchanged it and the second one did the same thing. Buy a different bag!
2,"attractive bag, poor inside construction","We have had the exact same experience as the previous two reviewers. We really liked the item but in a short time realized the inner lining started to tear away. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to review the product before it was purchased for us."
1,Poor construction,"I was very excited about this bag because it seemed to have everything I needed in terms of space and compartments. However, once I started using it, it kept tipping forward every time I put it down (my wallet isn't that heavy!) and after 2 weeks of normal use, the lining ripped. I wish that I had read the reviews before purchasing it at my local store. I assumed that the Eddie Bauer name meant that it was well constructed; however, as with many baby products, I have discovered that the name very rarely denotes quality! I would not recommend purchasing this product."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BAG,This bag is awefull. The lining is cheap. The bag is small. Not well made or designed. A waste of money. I purchesed one diaper bag with my first child and it lasted until my second child was born 2.5 years later just showing some wear and tear. This was my second diaper bag with my second and it only lasted a few months.
5,Great story,"This non-violent story is a great one. The best part, it is true. Everyone should see this story of overcoming adversity and learning to stay on course."
3,seven days in utopia,Having purchased the DVD I was very excited when it arrived in the post within a month. Unfortunately it does not play in colour in our DVD player. Apparantly USA to South Africa DVD's aren't always compatable. I was not aware of this fact.
3,so-so,"I really like Robert Duvall, so that is why I bought it. It is an interesting story because it is fact based."
4,Video vs book,"I loved the book and looked forward to the movie. The movie was goodbut it took great license with the characters, adding the woman, anddownplayed the truly Christian plot. What would I expect from Hollywoodtypes"
2,Toasting,I was/am looking for a toaster that toasts breadevenly on both sides. No so with this one andothers I've tried so far.
2,Just Doesn't Do Enough,"Going by the word choice and layout, it's clear this book is designed for someone who is no older than ten, however the instruction is written for someone who's had years of experience.The writer will say something like, there are four basic shapes: the cone, sphere, cube, and cylider. He will then show you those shapes and tell you to draw them, but he won't give one hint of instruction on how to do it. The whole book (all 40 pages of it) is just like that.I gave it 2 stars because the author takes the tone that you really can do this, and the book comes all the tools you'll need for the book."
3,Printer Stand,"As with this series of Winsome wood products, the design is excellent but the quality of wood leaves a lot to be desired. Nevertheless, it serves its purpose well."
3,"Nice Watch Winder, Not Great for Bigger Watches","Product looks very nice and works as advertised. However, larger watches bump up against the top glass when it is closed and the winder is rotating (this happened when I put a Panerai Luminor Marina watch in the winder)."
4,Big but it does the job,I chose this watch winder over others because it has the option to source its power from an AC or from 4 D-batteries. I need the D-batteries so that I can store it inside my safe and to protect my expensive watches.
3,All Your Summer Songs. Psychadelic 60's twang,"'All Your Summer Songs' seems to capture the spirit of every feel-good summer hook from the 60's and 70's, and squeezed into one album. My first impression was the retro 60's vibe of Olivia Tremor Control pumped-up on Brian Wilson-type strings, rings, and chimes galore, overseen by the lush production of Phil Spector. Thrown into the mix are slivers of the British Invasion riff-oriented sound, Belle And Sebastian's orchestral lounge, dabbling in a little Stonesy country-twang. But generally this CD is as much a homage to Phil Spector and Brian Wilson's adventurism as it is to the late psychadelic 60's, and to be honest, the more I'm listening to this, the more I'm liking it. 'All Your Summer Songs' transports you back somewhere in between kischy 60's sitcoms and The Age Of Aquarius, reminding one of more naive and happier times, when it really didn't take much to make you smile."
3,Research More Baby Bags Before Settling For This One,"I registered for this bag and by the time my son turned 3 months old, we started looking into buying a different diaper bag. It has all of the space that we needed and LOTS of pockets, but the fabric is tearing away from itself. It is NOT durable to say the least, and it isn't like we are over-packing it. It's just weak. We actually received two of these bags for our shower and one of the bags, (the one we returned, obviously), already had the fabric tearing away from itself and the strap was loose. So, do more research on bags before buying this one."
5,A very enjoyable book.. A must read for Red Baron fans.,"I found the book, Richthofen: Beyond the legend of the Red Baron to be a wonderful book. It was exicting and very interesting. Reading the letters in the book truly help the reader understand the man and the times he lived in. Lisa"
2,The Best Science and Nature Writing 2004,"Save your money. These authors have better to offer, as does the science collective as a whole. Look elsewhere for insightful musings."
4,Very good for the beginner,"I've hacked around with perl a little bit and mostly used the faqs and learned things the hard way. This document is aimed right at the beginner, someone who's maybe used perl only for a day or too. On the other hand, it's really nifty that it gives the ""tricks"" that are difficult to find easily. Highly recommended to at least skim over if you can, and definitely a buy if you're new at Perl."
4,Great replacement for the stock Troy-Bilt bump head!,My original TB425CS Troy-Bilt trimmer's head only had dual .095 lines. Once the old head stopped feeding line out reliably it was time for a better unit. The Grass Gator looked promising.I now use the Grass Gator 8010 with 2 larger diameter lines installed and it revs and cuts fine.
3,Grass gator,"Seems to cut ok but getting started took a while. The instructions are not very clear for something that comes with the amount of parts that this does. You will not use all of the parts. They are there so that the Grass gator can be fit to various trimmers. However, you need to figure out what is right for your trimmer when the instructions start to get vauge. I also had to trim a piece of plastic off of my trimmer guard because it kept removing the actual cutting wire from the Gator. FYI I did look on the website for further instruction."
1,Does not fit the homelite brand,"I brought this for my homelite straight shaft but it doesnot fit. I am disappointed about this product. The only item I like about this brand is the cutting string, it works great. I had to spent more money to purchase a RYOBI that works okay."
4,trimmer head review,"The Grass Gator head worked just great out of the box but eventually the original line wore out. I replaced the line with some .95 line I already had. Then the frustration started. The line broke or flew out of the head when I tried to cut any tall grass. The life of the line could be measured in seconds. I immediately blamed the new string trimmer head and was going to throw it away.I took a chance and bought some new Echo brand .130 Nylon line and ""bingo"", with the first use of the new line and head combination, I trimed a mile of pasture fence line using two tanks of fuel and the new line is still usable. I never thought the old line could be at fault but that was definately my problem. The Grass Gator head works just great with the new,fresh,nylon .130 line."
2,Won't Hold Trimmer Line,"I had another Grass gator and had no problems. However, this one is not so good. I am using a 36.3 cc motor and the line flies out of the trimmer head too often for this to be a quality product. I have to constantly stop and replace the line because it flies out of the head. The design flaw seems to be that you cannot use one single string to thread through 2 holes. The fact that it uses such thick line is good but the product is not made to tolerate either high speeds or thick grass. I really hoped this was worth the few dollars it cost but it is not."
4,A name restored,"This biography is dedicated to the notion that Bayard Rustin deserves to be rememebered. John D'Emilio is persuasive in that regard. This is a scholarly work and it's well-written. The author does an excellent job of placing Rustin's life in context, showing where he fits in as a 20th century organizer and civil rights activist. It's a satisfying work."
3,self destructed after a year,"I bought this unit, like many others, on the recommendation from Cooks Illustrated. It was a fabulous blender for about a year. Then I noticed some juice leaking out the bottom bearing after any blend session more than a minute. Then last week, it stated making some weird noises and about 3 seconds later, it threw itself off my counter in a fit of exaltation. The bearing exploded, destroying the plastic coupler on the container side, and then chewed the rubber couler on the base unit apart. For under $40 a year, I'd still say this was a decent deal, but I'm now deciding if I buy a vitamix for 10 years of use, or another Kalorik. If I do go with the Kalorik, I just hope that when it explodes next year, it contains something easy to clean off of everything..."
3,chipped top,Jar is quite small and it came damaged but it was such a small chip that i didnt want the hassle of sending it back. It works good for medium sized milkbone treats.
5,Beautiful Box Set!,"What a wonderful show--so glad all the seasons have been released to DVD. It looks like the graphic designer even had a good time putting the artwork together, as the complete book set looks awesome! I only wish there was an episode guide booklet.The show is actually pretty complex and smart, with a few silly episodes here and there though. I love that Jem and the Holograms work hard for success, while the Misfits are pretty entertaining as well. Jem and the Holograms are fun and great role models for little girls. Although Rio seems to pretty much cheat on Jerrica with Jem (who is the same person), ha. I wish that storyline got a little more fleshed out though.I hope the show becomes revived at some point for a new generation. They could even take the GLEE route and sell longer versions of the songs on iTunes.Worth checking out!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,I love it watched it 2-3 times wish the dolls were available in stores in a new a better version compared to the older ones
1,Can't believe these are abridged!!!,"Why, why why??? Would they do this?!?!?! What was the company thinking releasing this chopped up version of such a cool show. They've cut out a bunch of dialog, shortened songs and really took the heart out of the series.If you want the TRUE, complete, original episodes, but the older DVDs which are sold on Amazon as Seasons 1 & 2 and Season 3 Part one. True, you won't have all of season 3, but at least you'll get the others as you once watched them when you were a kid!Jem - The Complete 1st & 2nd SeasonsI can't get the link for season 3 through the insert application, but maybe this will work:http://www.amazon.com/Jem-Season-3-Part-1/dp/B0002M5TP2/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1330456782&sr;=1-1If you want the real think, don't buy this chopped up, abridged ""complete""(NOT) set!"
2,How many ways can you make grilled cheese?,"While I love the Grateful Dead and had many great times in the lots eating and partying, I was a little disappointed in this book. It oversimplifies the variety of people in the lots and the food offered. But, for nostalgia's sake, I have to say that I read it a number of times and got a lttle teary looking at the pictures. If anything, buy it to support a fellow Deadhead and get a few good recipes in the meantime."
2,really quite awful,"This book is really quite awful. There's nothing wrong with Peter Diamond himself, but almost every plot turn seems unlikely to absurd in my humble opinion. I get the feeling that the author read a couple of articles on autism and a couple of articles on the pharmeceutical industry (I know something about the latter) and attempted to write a mystery on that basis. It didn't work. The other books in the series may hold up better, but I'm not going to give them a chance."
3,Expected more,"I loved her Songs from the Heart which introduced me to, who I think has the best voice in gospel music. But her Greatest Hits didn't blow me away like I though it would. Good, not great. Just good."
5,Outstanding!,"Although I mistakenly purchased this from another vendor at a higher price (albeit the shipping was free), the CD is worth the price if only for the song, ""A Prayer Away"", although there are many others I enjoy as well. It's just that that particular song made me feel as if Jesus was riding in the car with me reminding me He is JUST a prayer away. How sad I fail to keep this at the forefront of my mind when times are hard and/or trying and my patience is wearing thin. Thank you, Miss Yolanda, for blessing us with your amazing God-given gift. Your songs speak to my heart and lift me up, particularly when I think I'm at the end of my rope. You remind me to ""tie a knot in my rope and keep holding on""."
2,Disappointed reader,"I was not at all pleased once I received the book at the full purchase price. I was expecting more formal policies already written. The ones included in the book are very broad and most likely unuseful in their current format to most any business. I recommend that you get the book, but do not pay the full price for it. Find it used."
3,Worthy of a look,"I think the idea behind this film was good and that the film quality was good. It was a bit slow and had a 70's feel to it. It is a late bloomer coming out story. The guy finally deals with his feelings at the 30 something stage of life and starts moving towards the life that he denied himself. He starts telling his friends and family as well as looking for that life partner he has always wanted. It was worth watching but not as good as it should have been. It is a fairly fresh view and will prove thought provoking. Not bad, just not great."
1,Complete Trash!,"This was the most pathetic waste of film that I have ever seen! Both characters were felony trailer trash, with the I Q'S of a doorknob. It looked like someone filmed this with their neighbors and a cheap video camera. It was about as entertaining as a head cold. After viewing this piece of trash, it was tossed directly into the trash. I could not put anyone else through the torture of watching it. Pass on this one, or I will do the Will and Grace ""Told Ya So"" Dance for you!"
4,Great Book By An Innovative Writer,"The original publication date of this book I believe is 1994, so this book was way ahead of its time. It reminds me a little bit of the movie entitled ""The Thirteenth Floor"". I love stories along the lines of what I like to call ""the Blur"", where reality and virtual reality cross and the distinction between them becomes less defined. This book is right up that alley. Well written, good characters, interesting plot. Well worth the read."
5,Dick Van Dyke - What more can be said,One of the most entertaining of the sitcoms. Something you are not embarassed if someone finds you watching the series.
2,"Great material, Bad DVD production","When you talk about classic TV, The Dick Van Dyke Show is a perfect example. It's a shame the folks who put the dvd together did so with such little care. Very sloppy design. When I want to just play thru all the episodes it will only let you do it one at a time and the menu is confusing. Not worth it. Who ever did the design should be ashamed."
5,absolutely love it!!!,The episodes are awesome. They are so funny. Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore are great together. Love it!
3,No close caption!,"The show it's self rates a 5 plus!, everything about the presentation of the show on the disc is fine, except, there is no closed captions! hello!, we have deaf people in our family! and there are a lot more out there. I thought there is a federal law................."
5,Dick Van Dyke,This collection is great. I remember watching this years ago and loving it. This is a good clean family show that very entertaining. It's hilarious.
5,A remarkable and enlightening book,"Of all the gifts I received, this was the best. The anecdotes were wonderful, and the quotations indicate the depth and breadth of the persons who understand this world we live in. We have family members ranging in size from draft horses to a 22 year old Slider turtle (youngster, I know) - and this book reinforces every experience we've had over the years. If you love animals - or even if you just love life - get this book."
3,It's NOT the Gin Blossoms,"This wasn't what I expected coming from 2 of the members of the Gin Blossoms. Actually, I heard that the other member of the Gas Giants was a member of the Gin Blossoms way back in the day. Anyway... the Gin Blossoms put out incredible albums. Generally, there aren't many bad tunes on their cds. But the Gas Giants couldn't pull that off. ""I hope my kids like Marylin Manson"" and ""Quitter"" are really good songs. But the rest of the album is average at best. It was sort of a filler during the time when the Gin Blossoms had broken up. Hearing Robin's voice and Phil's beats was great but it lacked Bill's bass lines. But hey, they're not supposed to be the Gin Blossoms so I'll cut them some slack.As a side note.. what the heck is with the name ""Gas Giants"" anyway????????????"
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!,I loved the Gin Blossoms and was very pleased to hear that some of the members got together again. My disposition changed drastically when I listened to the CD. The songs do not even come close in terms of quality of melodies and overall song substance. None of the songs are as emotional or gripping as original Gin Blossoms recordings. Hopefully if they try again they will go back to the original formula as it worked beautifully!
5,Just What It Says,"It is exactly as the title says: a simple explanation of work ideas. Nicoll has done well to pre-digest this teaching so that those unfamiliar with the teaching can be nourished by it. It covers the necessary basic concepts of genuine self-transformation, addressing man, not as he is, but as he can be. This book is not for those who are 'into self-help' or the popular spiritual discipline of the day. It is for those who are sincere in their wish to be different, to contact the inner circles of mankind through which the teachings originate. While first contact with it is superficial, any actual and sincere efforts made according to this books suggestion, will reveal deeper and deeper layers of the essential human being that one is.This is a fairly short read, and yet it arrives due to a great effort spanning mny lifetimes. Read this with reverence. It is for real."
5,Works,"Installed, working fine with no problems. Seems remanufactured printer cartridges can be ""hit or miss"", but no problems so far with these. No long-term experience, though - have only printed a couple documents so far."
2,find a better vendor,"Unless you get lucky, Amazon is shipping Sharp's pxa250 processors that they discontinued over a year ago. The processors are buggy and don't use a lot of software correctly. There are kernel work-arounds if you are linux savy which are quite stable, but paying for a product that has been discontinued over a year ago doesn't make much sense, especially when you have to jump through hoops and recompile a kernel just to get the unit working correctly.For those that want an awesome pda and the challenge of building their own, this is a great unit. If you are looking for something fast and stable out of the box, get a vendor with the 400mz pxa 255 processor. The Z is an awesome pda, I have SQL, Python and java running from mine, I'd just suggest you look for the more recent version you don't have to fix out of the box."
1,Sent me different type of adapter,i received a 1/8 to rca instead of 1/4 to rca and had to return. Then for 60 cents more i bought a 6 foot 1/4 to rca cable and worked fine.
4,Good introduction to issues of technical reports,"I found this book to be a good introduction to issues of documenting accidents as well as the creation of technical reports by engineers from the narratives of people who are not engineers but with a great deal of tacit knowledge about risky environments. While the primary focus of the research documented in this book is for the coal mining idustry, the material has applications to other types of hazardous industries as well as to any project which involves people of differing specialities. For me this book pulled together some other readings on the construction of social reality and the transformation of information derived from different, non-scientific viewpoints into a technical report suitable for managers and engineers. Of especial interest to me was the section on gestures and how gestures provide information in a visual way that is seldom captured with any degree of accuracy within technical reports."
3,Longer would be better,"I got this rope to lift my plow and that is all it can be used for. It's great for that, but if you have anything else in mind go a little longer."
3,hard lives in an unkind world,"ON INDIAN TIME could have been depressing, however, Judi Blaze has balanced the stories of the brothers, & written a lean & emotional tale.Rebeccasreads recommends ON INDIAN TIME as an uncomplicated glimpse into the light & dark of living with anger in a world where you're not wanted...& making a place for yourself...or not! 3 stars because it needed more editing."
5,On Indian Time,"This book has stuck with me ever since I read it. It is compelling, sad, touching in many ways. It is a true work of art and I would reccomend anyone who likes good literature read this book. The characters are real sincere, fighing for the lost identity between white and Indian. A great read"
4,Mobile Edge Paris Backpack,"This is a great backpack for combining all your stuff along with your notebook computer. I particularly like the flap which makes the compartments more secure. There are separate compartments, so folders don't get bent, nor do they slide down if there isn't much in the pack. The front compartment has also sub-cubbies which can hold PDA, phone, pens, etc. The whole thing is a little square and bulky, but not uncomfortably so. I use it on public transportation every day. The straps are very comfortable as well. It slips on and off easily. Backpacks are easier on the back than briefcases, but most of them don't look very professional. This one does."
5,Rev it up Rev!,"LUCKY 7 Rocks! It's like the the second coming of the RHH music I came to love in the 90s. Even though I did enjoy their past outing, it was noticeably tamer than their earlier stuff. Not LUCKY 7! This album will not dissapoint the casual, or die hard RHH fans."
1,gross!,"What an ugly doll! Sorry, but it's true. Her lips are ugly. She is cheaply made. Boooo!!!!! Two thumbs down!"
4,Hal Jordon,"I grew up on Green Lantern. I lived and died Hal Jordan durring my formative years. He is, and always will be my favorite Super Hero. Then came this book. Hal Jordan goes Rouge and eliminates all his friends, allies, and mentors. Yet I belived it. Every word of it. I was quite surprised by the uproar in the comics industry over this arc. I agree with most reviews in that the story wasn't flushed out enough, it felt rushed, etc. I feel a lot of the uproar was over the removal of Hal himself. People had trouble excepting their fallen hero. (regardless of the fact that he is a fictional character) I enjoy when hero's fall from grace. Literatue is ripe with Tragic Heros. I miss Hal's stories, I miss his GL, but I admire him for what he did, and who he was. In his position, your damn right I would have killed every mother lovin' thing I saw, even if I was Hal Jordan."
5,warning: too hot for standard car audio,"awesome beats! the phat bass craves a 300-watt deck, 2-way speakers, and 15' subwoofers! this is the perfect cd to play in a show car!"
4,Very helpful,"While I was traveling around China last summer, I was never without this phrase book. I brought several dictionaries and phrase books with me and, in the end, this one was the most helpful. On a day when I didn't have much room in my pack, this was the book I always made room for. That being said, no phrase book is going to be perfect, so, when I could spare the space in my bag, I would also pack a pocket-sized Chinese dictionary to supplement this phrase book.One improvement that I would suggest for this item is that it could really use some more blank notes pages. I mostly eat vegetarian food when I can and, as I learned the pinyin and characters for the different veggies I wanted to order, I had trouble cramming my notes into the small bit of blank space in this book.Overall, this book was very useful and definitely saved my butt on more than one occasion!"
3,Interesting but not a strategy guide,"The subtitle of this book says ""Poker Strategies, Winning Hands, and Stories...""The order of those three should be reversed, because this is largely a collectoin of stories. True, you can learn from these stories if you pay attention (if you ever play Phil, I suppose this could help), but most of his analysis seems self-explanatory, or merely justification of a wierd play that he made himself.The most annoying thing about this book is the amazing sense of deja vu you get while reading it. Many of these stories have already been printed in CardPlayer Magazine, which I found annoying, since I am a reader.These things said, the book is entertaining if you like bad beat stories and stories about big hands. If that is what you are looking for, definitely get it. It is a quick read for your bedside or bathroom, and should be viewed mainly as entertainment."
1,Egomania at its worst,"Phil's ego is an amazing thing: he can slice off slabs of it off, make a sandwich of it using two book covers as bread, sell dozens of copies to suckers who don't know any better, and still his ego never seems to get smaller! The Hellmuth WonderEgo may be the eighth wonder of the world.If you want to read about how wonderful Phil thinks he is, this may be the book for you. If you want to read about poker, pick up any number of far-better books. Just don't waste your money on this piece of drivel."
1,worth reading once if you can find it in the library,"I saw this book at the local library. Read it in about an hour. I would never buy this book and don't recommend it to anyone. I think Phil is a brilliant poker player. His reads on people is uncanny. But I didn't see much value in his telling of these hands in the method he did. I'm sure there are lessons to be learned from some of these, but not in the format they are in."
4,___,"i think that last guy's kind of missing the point, but whatever. I like this album, but beat happening is one of my favorite bands, so i'm a little biased."
3,It's an okay book,Thanksgiving on Thursday is an okay book because it is about a boy (Jack) and a girl (Annie) that go back in time to the first feast of thanksgiving. They help a woman prepare for the first Thankgiving dinner. They had to gather some of the food for the harvest. Jack gets caught in a snare set for an animal! Read it--it's okay!
5,Excellent Book!,"After reading some reviews, I bought two guides (just in case), since DK Eyewitness Guide was labled as ""expensive"". But I wound up using only DK Guide. It has everything you need. The information is easily accessible. The maps are great. Just perfect for a quick reference. You'll find yourself refering to it again and again while walking the streets of Amsterdam (I just couldn't deal with reading long pages of information (probably very useful) in Frommer's Guide).The selection of restaurans was great. Every restaurant rated in this book that we went to was a hit."
1,Save Your Money,Very little useful information in this book. It is a real ripoff at 19.95. Save your money and look the info up on the internet.
4,good looks,"this product looks good and has four lights that properly match the decor of the unit. the installation is simple, however the main bracket for main housing attachment is a bit flimsy and may require your bending it for proper fit to ceiling."
5,happy with the fan,"I use it with a dimmer and i needed more light so this one works great. Fan even at low setting provides nice breeze, easy installation, overall works out great for me...Year later, still love it..."
5,FANtastic,I bought three of these fans because I thought the price was great and the description and image appeared reasonable. The actual items lived up to the standard and I am very pleased with how well they function. They are quite attractive and are very pleasing to the eye and most of all they cool the rooms effectively.
5,Great fan!,"Unit is well designed and priced right. I managed to install two of those fans in two hours without having any technical difficulties or missing parts. Motor is very quite in all three speeds. When on, fan provide sufficient amount of air flow. Excellent quality, attractive design, good price, and fast delivery."
4,Organizational Behavior,Book was beneficial for class. It gave a lot of insights on issues within coporate organizations which could be used in schools as well.
1,Horrible,This seller put this book under the 11th edition and ended up sending me a 4th edition....the book is completely useless...beware!!!!!
3,Apology from the seller,"The book I had received from Escobook was not hardcover as it was promised. It was also an Indian edition. (No color, thin paper, no different than photocopy) I paid almost $80 for $20 book. As soon as the the seller was informed about my dissatisfaction of the product, she sent my money back."
4,INK saver!!!!,"I have had no problems with the printing or the scanning with this one. It consumes fully HALF or less Ink than any Canon machine I have ever owned, which I will never buy again. Its a bit slow on the printing, but the quality is good... value for money this is the best printer ive bought. It costs what 4 canon ink pots will cost you, and it will go twice the distance.Edit on february 11 2011Im still using the same printer! and it still works perfectly! And you can get the cheap ink packs on amazon as well!!! Best printer ive ever owned!"
2,More like a 9 piece set...,"I am not very happy with the way this is advertised..pretty much think it should be a given that lids are included, since they are storage. Maybe I clicked too fast but I thought I was getting 18 bowls! My other gripe with Amazon is that it was sent in a postal box! It is a gift for Christmas and I have nothing to wrap it in. I understand if it was labled or picked by me as that new no hassle packaging vs the retail, but there is no option! I assumed it would come retail as normal!! Irritating and probably going back.I will say though, goes to show how great Pyrex is. They were shipped each *lightly* wrapped in bubble wrap with some room to move and they are all in one piece!"
1,Misleading Marketing,Thought I was buying 18 glass containers but it seems that 18 pieces means 9 containers plus 9 lids. Since when does a lid count as a seperate piece? The lid alone is useless. Do not like being misled. Will not buy from again!
4,Almost perfect,We are trying to get away from the cheap chemical leaking plastic containers. These are GREAT. the lids seal very well and they are very sturdy. They are much easier to clean than plastic ones. Storing them is harder as they take up alot more room.I have not yet found a use for the smaller round bowls. They are very small. Too small for morning breakfast and leftovers that small I usually just throw away.
5,Great value,"I love these. I ordered two sets for storage of leftovers, and I will probably order more in the future. I love that I can take them out of the fridge and heat up in the microwave."
4,Great Set - Shipping Problems,"I would give this set 5 stars, however, as many have noted, there is a problem with breaking. Out of four sets we had a couple broken bowls. Rather bad damage ratio.I do want to emphasize, I love these bowls. Use them everyday. And, what a great price! I will be ordering more in the future."
4,Sturdy and effective.,Better than plastic and sturdier than most other products. The lids are bit too tight and will retain harsh odors. The best solution is to have few containers for things like desserts and fruits maybe. Not a problem for me if you soak the lid for few minutes.
5,Containers,"These were a gift to my sister since she is freaked out about using plastic tupperware and BPA...although I think she's also glad to have to do fewer dishes since she can microwave, serve and store food all in the same dish."
3,Product is Great...Amazon Shipping and Customer Service Disappointing,"I ordered these bowls to match with some items I already own. They are just what I expected...love them.My issue is with Amazon. I wished I had read more reviews before I ordered. Other people have had problems with breakage during shipping. I ended up with a chip in a bowl. That means I can't use one of my 4-cup bowls in this set. When I wrote to Amazon explaining the situation, they referred to my un-usable bowl as ""slight damage"" and offered $3. The Amazon price to replace this bowl would be $7.99. Hardly seems fair. I tried to explain this in yet another e-mail, and the response I got from Amazon was to thank me and issue me the $3 to my account. My request was completely ignored. That is AWFUL customer service. I've been a great customer of Amazon...but with that kind of customer service, I will think twice about placing any future orders. I certainly will purchase my Pyrex items directly from Pyrex from now on."
3,Pyrex holds a lot of goodies... but,"The item came damaged. One of the larger bowls was completely broken. The packaging was rather minimal (basically nothing). They just put the actual Pyrex retail box inside of another cardboard shipping box that was slightly larger. To ""pad"" the inside, they used a tiny bit of crumpled up paper.Come on guys, you should know that you are shipping GLASS. While it is still Pyrex (very strong), shipping glass should require that you use additional care, especially when shippers throw packages around.Other than that, the actual bowls are alright. It would be nice if they had a handle to pick them up with (like many corningware glass products have)."
3,"great, until you break them","I am a big fan of pyrex. I owned quite a few set of them. They are wonderful for storage. However, just make sure you don't break them. I dropped one from the shelf by accident one time, it broke into hundreds of tiny little pieces, and they were so fine and sharp, almost impossible to clean them up. I was so I still got half a dozen cut from tiny microscopic glass pieces. It is way worse than any other glass I ever broke. I had to keep my kids, and dog out of the kitchen for a week, just to make sure we got all the pieces."
1,Cheap toy with little appeal,"This looks like lots of fun, but in reality it's a piece of junk. It falls apart constantly, causing much frustration with kids (and the adults who keep having to put it back together). My son lost interest in it after a couple weeks and it has sat in his closet ever since."
2,Bob the broken toy,"My two year old is obsessed with Bob the Builder so I didn't mind shelling out $30 for the toy, but now am regretting it as I have had to replace the first one because it was broken when I opened the box, and now I find that the second one which we replaced today is also broken. I live in a rural area and had to drive two hours to replace the first one. It is an expensive toy for what you get and it appears to have very little in the way of durability. Not sure what to do about this as my son doesn't want to take another one back and I don't want to pay $30 for a broken toy."
5,Excellant,I've had another copy of this CD for severalyears and my wife and I love the music. When we couldn't find our CD I went looking for another. We have given a copy to friends in the past
2,If they gave stars for anti-climax this is a 5,"This was a truly disappointing finish to the series. The big showdown that had been brewing for the last 4 books between the followers of Elestree and Llolth results in a battle that lasts about 60 seconds and takes three pages. It seems as though Kemp just didn't like the whole previous set-up and wanted to get on with hsi own characters--the crazy necromancer and his army that Kemp introduces.I also must say that most of the interesting personality conflicts that had made the other books more interesting (such as between Beanre and Fearun, disappear.) All of the characters have become two (maybe even one) dimensional."
2,pretty weak ending,"I really enjoyed the first 4 books of this series. Book 5 nearly ruined it for me. I don't blame Kemp for this book as he had to clean up the mess from book 5 and I'm sure keep to Salvatore's plot. However the ending is just weak. A poor way to end a series. There are no ""surprises"" as another review stated. It just falls flat. Big deal Lloth transforms herself. I don't care about her. I cared about the characters and the killed the majority of them off. After finishing the series I realized there was no point to it and I wasted my money on all six hardcover books.so my question to R.A. is what is the point?"
1,a really bad ending to a good story,"Books 1-4 of the war of the spider queen were great, but then book 5 was kinda not as good, and the book 6... Nothing seems to go right in this book. Whatever you thought was going to happen, well, it's probably not going to. The story doesn't flow as well, and the story just bounces around from each character setting without fully finishing one scene to the next. I was very disappointed with this last book. Maybe having all different authors wasn't such a great idea, although the first 4 followed through pretty well."
2,Disappointing Conclusion,"I must say that I had enjoyed the first five of the six, but the finish left me disappointed. I understand that it must be difficult for an author to pick up where another has left off, and make the story his own, but this one seems to just tie up some loose ends and leaves me thinking ""so what."" Lloth disappears, her followers' lives are in upheaval, the drow are threatened by other evil actors, and Lloth returns, ""reborn."" So what? Okay, some characters were developed and killed off, but ""so what."" We, the readers are taken to some interesting places in the Forgotten Realms world, but I think the author, Paul Kemp, stayed in the box and kept it a neat and tidy wrap up of an otherwise great tale. Not sure if this is a failure of the author, or if he was given stringent guidelines to keep it plain and simple.In a word, ""disappointment."""
2,... really?,"I LOVED all the books up to this one. I actually was planning on taking a day off from work just to relax and read the entire book cover to cover. Glad I didn't. The characters in this series are bad asses, extremely intelligent, and extremely driven. This book didn't reflect that at all. There were more than a few places where in my mind I was saying there is no way in heck that they would do that. Then in the whole series there were underlying hints that Lolth was changing ... well nothing. She changed her looks. (Spoilers) And she changed where her realm was. That's all. Extremely anti-climatic ending. The ending TRIED to show us that Lolth was Chaotic, we knew that already, and the ending was forced. Fantastic series, all books get a 5 star except this one."
1,Let down and a half,"Ok I waited a long time for the last book to come out for this series, trns out I should have kept waiting. The author took Valas out of the whole book, all the characters seemed to act and behave like diferent characters. Spent way to much time on pointless things like Magic Wards and such. And the ending left me with the feeling that ""the author should have at least bought me dinner first"" All in all it was horrible compared to the rest but at the same time made the previous five books not even worth reading. The author should be tar and feathered."
1,A waste of time.,"This book was a waste of time. It seems that R. A. Salvatore wanted noting more than to introduce new writers......and make some money......in the Drow world that he created. This book is the final and sad ending to a series that showed great promises. It takes 5 books to say....""sorry no change"". It is as if R. A. Salvatore was letting others write about his ideas but limited them so much that the ending was the same as the beginning. As far as the whole ""Lolth is the definition of chaos"" thing, that is bunk. The Drow seem to go out of there way to make people play by their rules...which would define lawful but evil...and not chaotic."
4,"To the naysayers, Chaos HAS no purpose, it is what it is.","It seems a lot of people was quite disappointed by ""Resurrection"", the six and last vol. of the War of the Spider Queen series.I, for one, wasn't. Becuase the ending, and what Lolth said herself exemplify what we should expect from the Spider Queen to begin with.She is Chaos personified. Chaos HAS no purpose, no reason. It is what it is and that is enough, and what she had done: drawing the Demonweb out of the Abyss, renewing herself by devouring her yor'thae, the subsequent destruction and routing of her worshippers and cities, just simply the result from the glory of Chaos, of her very nature.The ultimate irony is that most readers probably felt like Quenthel toward the end of the book. But some, like me, who know what to expect from one such as Lolth, practically shiver with delight to know that all this grief and destruction was simply just a spur of the moment whim of a capricicious demon goddess.That in itself is enough."
1,Utter Garbage,"Pretty much every complaint has been covered in the past 60+ reviews, so I'm just going to add input of a personal nature.I think this book was awful, and it completely ruined the series for me. The rest of the authors in the series (Byers, Baker, etc) show great talent and will develope into fantastic authors. Mr. Kemp, on the other hand, shouldn't quit his day job, which his bio proceeds to inform us is the legal profession.The story itself is extremely disjointed, Kemp has a very amateurish writing style, and the ending is simply atrocious, with every major character makeing completely incomprehensible choices that simply to do not click with the way the characters have progressed in the rest of the series.My advice: Read all the way up to book 5 then decide you want the series to end yourself; you'll be much better off than wasting money on this trash."
1,HORRIBLE,"I do not even know how to put this into words. I am so dissatisfied with this book ending the series. Everything that happened in this book was not how the reader would have liked it. They killed a bunch of people they should not have. They killed the likable characters. When the story ended, I felt cheated. RA Salvatore, big disappointment!!! These writers he introduced aren't that great either."
5,helmet review,"easy process, well packed, shipped quickly, product was as described and displayed. will buy again from vendor."
3,for the price its okay,when i got the helmet i could already see the cheap molding and its HUGE i mean my head for a motorcycle helmet is XL so this is like XXL to me and the straps are not so great. yeah of course it wont hurt to get hit in the head with a airsoft gun but it makes you a bobble head and you stick out like a soar thumb.
4,"Big Help, still requires some technique","This thing has really sped up my paint prep. I've never been able to tape off a 15 ft wall with one single piece, but this lets you do that. While it basically does the taping for you, you still need to use some technique. For example, applying tape the a thin 1/4"" edge, like the top of your baseboard, is a bit tricky.Giving it 4 out of 5 because the tape tearer could work better and one of the wheels fell off of my model after 2 rooms of usage. I'm hoping to fix that on my own.One bummer, it requires a smaller 30 yard roll ""Type C"""
4,one of the best albums i have herd in a while,"this album has many great tracks including charge laughing and high life, i would recomend it to everyone as a good listen!!!!!!!!!! you wont be dissapointed"
2,Is this supposed to be punk rock?,"What is this recording supposed to be? The Germs? The Stitches? Give me a break. Just because they work at Zed Records doesn't mean they know punk rock any more than the average mall rat. They have an expensive recording studio and they still put out stuff that sounds like this because they're ""lo-fi"" and ""punk"". They care more about their looks than Justin Timberlake, is that supposed to be a good thing? They are so ""different"" with their vintage clothes and Spock haircuts. Are rich suburban punk rockers the new trend? Obviously, judging by the other reviews here"
4,"Inspiring Color Use, Less than Inspiring Design","Being a creative quilter who shys away from traditional colors and patterns, I was drawn to Freddy's book. Her use of color is bold and brave, but her color theory and design skills leave a bit too be desired. The book isn't intended to be a how-to book, but rather an inspiration to quilters and that is it's success. If you are a quilter trying to break out of your calico mold then this is the book for you. If how-to books are what you seek then you might want to look elsewhere."
4,She surrounds herself with color!,"The quilt patterns and instructions are incidental to the fabulous color inspiration in this book. Freddy shows us her bold use of color in her home as well as in her quilts. EVERY page is filled with fabulous color! If color turns you on and you are looking for a boost in creativity, this is the book for you!"
4,Interesting Quest,"I have been trying to get my hands on this book for years and finally, bought it used via Amazon. It has been well worth the time and effort. The two highlights for me are:1) Ordway's recollections of searching obscure foreign bookstores for even more obscure books depicting stories of space travel, and2) the reprints and recreations of the famous Collier's space travel series artwork from the 1950's.This is a very satisfying book for someone fascinated with early visions of how man would explore space."
2,not enough dub,With a name like the Dub Pistols one would expect a lot of dub or dub influenced songs in their album . However the album offers very little. It's not a bad album on the whole. It's just another example of a band trying to capitalize on the genre of dub by including the sacred word in its name.
3,"good not great, read why","it's a decent album, with a few good tracks that really stand out. tracks like cyclone (can be heard on tony hawk pro skater 2 video game) and let's start a riot. it's got a taste of tecno. i HIGHLY recomend their newer cd, released in 2001, one million ways to live lavish. it blows this cd out of the water. if you've heard the cd you know what i'm talking about. it has less of the tecno and more just feel good smooth flowing beat."
4,Nice unit,"The sound apparently comes out quite clearly on the other end. For me, the sound is just fine. I wish the mute switch and volume control were a little higher up on the cord (closer to the headset)."
3,Sennheiser PC150 Noise Cancelling PC Headset,"The product was missing user instructions, so I have no idea what all the features are and could not register the product. Other than that, all was ok."
4,Clear Sound and Comfort,"very good price, Good sound, long cable, comfortableThe bass with these headphones is outstandingThis headset is one of the best headsetsCONSthe wire is too thin"
3,"Nice rack for the price, needs extra parts for a Yakima rack",I bought this earlier in the week. I was attracted to it because it would work on my car (Thule crossbars) and my wife's car (Yakima crossbars).It turns out that you need extra parts for the rack to work with a Yakima rack and they are not included with the rack itself. This is something to be aware of if you have a Yakima roof rack.
5,Leslie S.,"My children are regularly singing the songs from this album, whether they are listening to it or not! It has been a fantastic way to introduce them to various composers. They have become quite good at identifying composers based on their musical styles from this CD! It's a lot of fun!"
2,For Novices Only,"If you are an experienced coach or player, pass on this one. It will give you close to nothing. If you are a beginner, there is some value but still there are better options out there. Can't recommend."
1,what happened?,"what happened to the aquabats? they used to be so good. i could listen to the fury all day any day. now this stuff is terrible. its such a drastic change, i dont think it should have been done. i was going to buy an aquabats shirt, and then i got this cd. after listening to it i decided nevermind the shirt. all i have left to say is boo to that."
5,The Aquabats Rock!!,"This new CD is a little different than their old, more ska-ish ones, but it's still awesome! The lyrics are funny and the songs have tons of energy that just make you want to sing along! Can't wait to see their show on this tour!"
2,Disappointed that the photos were in back and white and that the paper in the book was of poor quality,"This book was apparently a reprint of an older book without updates or any upgrading. Print is small, photos are in back and white and difficult to see clearly. The book takes an exciting subject and dulls it. I purchased this book to use as reference material in a small beach cottage. I am disappointed in this book."
2,The Cipher,"Certainly a page turner due ti its unique story line, but outcome was predictable and oildcoulld have come sooner. Felt like a first novel, which it was."
1,Mental Black Hole,"The concept of this book caught my attention, black hole in the store room, very cool. After a few pages I was confused, but I persevered, and became frustrated. Still I trudged on, patiently waiting for something to happen, eventually reaching last page.... still nothing. 95% of Ms. Kojas ""prose"" is mumbo-gumbo-jumbo and irrelevent to the story."
2,Very poor color,"I had such high hopes with this product as I had had success with another non-HP ink product. However, the black seems fine, but the colors are rather abysmal. Reds are closer to brown; yellow is closer to mustard, etc. Very disappointed. As I'm using this in my home, I'll live with it...this time only. On the plus side, the product was shipped and received quickly."
3,Muddy color,"The ink cartridge arrived as promised, so I have no problem with the service. The ink cartridge fits in the printer perfectly, too. However, the quality of the color is not good. The bright, sharp colors of the OEM are simply not there. Primary colors are muddy, especially the blues and purples."
5,"Charles Platt's ""Dream Makers"" -- a book worth finding","I've owned my mass-market copy of this book for a bit over twenty years. It's one of very few books that I've kept such a long time. Platt interviewed twenty-nine science fiction authors, many of whom have since died, and does a great job of not only presenting the major points of lengthy interviews, but also offers context for the interviews, and sometimes reference to his own relationships with the authors. Particularly worthwhile are his interviews with Philip K. Dick and J.G. Ballard. It's out of print, but with some research you can likely track down a copy, and make it one to keep on your shelves."
3,First one was better,I'm a huge fan of the first CD so bought the second... It has some great tracks but overall I thought that the first one was better.
3,Not the Actual Game Soundtrack,"Compared to its first volume, one could say that the second part should have sufficed the fan's demand for the actual game soundtrack. Again, many of the musical pieces are somehow arranged---prolonged additions or changed in style--which was almost unlike from its first release.I bought the second volume because I wanted the original game soundtrack (from the purist perspective), not for some licensed altered versions of it. I already loved the first volume, and I thought that the second one would actually incorporate the actual soundtracks from the game."
5,Absolutely amazing!,"Some of the best music I've ever heard. Timeless. It will bring back memories of the game, but there's no need to have ever played Halo to enjoy this beautiful music."
2,Editions Can (and Sometimes DO) Matter,"My wife needed this book (Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood) for her teaching certification course and we were happy to find it here for so cheap. We knew it might be a little different because it was likely an older edition, thus the lower price, but how different could it be? Well, it was different enough for her to get lost in trying to follow along with the class. She ultimately got so frustrated trying to use this book that she bought the latest version. I advise you to check with your teacher first or you could go through the same frustrations she did."
1,Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Practice III edition.,I thought it was too good to be true when I found this textbook for only $1.oo. When I went to class it was not the third edition. It was an old discontinued edition. So I had to purchase the newer edition. This was the only time I've had any problems with Amazon. I will continue to shop with them.
2,Humorous dialogue/disappointing plot,"While I found this book to be full of good-natured humor, and the bantering dialogue between the couple was well-written, the plot was seriously lacking and the circumstances weren't very believeable. The beginning of the story dragged on-and-on. It was at least half-way through the story, if not further, before Jane and John began confronting the problem. From that point on, I found the clues too vague and the unravelling of the situation too confusing to follow. I'm still not sure exactly how it was resolved...the detective work at the end was rushed, especially compared to the slow-moving beginning to the story. Not well-balanced at all.As well, Jack and Jane fell in love way too quickly, especially considering how mismatched they were. It's hard to imagine that after spending less than a week together, they were ready to marry ""immediately"" and live happily ever after."
2,"If you love the olympics, watch it on TV","This is a pretty game. This is a game with lots of events. Yeah! I have found the positive in this game. Ok, the real deal. THis game is pretty fu, but not really fun. You will not want to play it again and again. However, if you are using it to show your kids the gist of the olypics, or want the family to get into the spirit of the olympics,then jump in and enjoy yourself. Is it worth the price? No. Wait for the bargain bin, but only if you really got to have it for some reason other than playing a fun game."
1,Simplistic and repetitive,"The advice in this book is not bad, but it is very simplistic and there is nothing new here. If you have listened to any program on retirement or read any recent magazine article on the topic, everthing here will be familiar. You can expect to live longer, work longer and should plan in a holistic way for your retirement to provide for financial, spiritual, emotional and physical well-being. Other than advising diversification and spending less than you earn, Ruth offers no specific financial advice. The book is very short and repetitive and typographical errors are irritating. If you make the same mistake as I did and buy this text, you will be helping Ruth's retirement plan much more than your own."
1,Not accurate,"There are many errors in this book. For example, the author is completely off in his account of Sickles and Jay Gould. He just has that story dead wrong when it comes to the extent to which Sickles was involved in the Gould affair, the actions he and Gould took, and the rumuneration involved. That's just one example."
2,Sloppy research,What could have been a interesting book about a fascinating historical character is ruined by authorial and editorial laziness. Mr. Keneally's work is rife with inaccuracies that any involved fact checker would have easily caught. Readers with the smallest familiarity with Lorenzo Daponte's life or the American Civil War will be offended by the misrepresentation of well known facts. If the author gets the easy stuff wrong how can he be trusted with the more arcane?
1,"OK, now write the book.","This book reads like there is an invisible ""and then"" beginning each sentence. If it were the chronological outline for the actual book, I would say good job; but as a published biography, it is almost unreadable. The fact that I slog (and skim) on is purely testament to the fascinating Sickles and despite the author's inane ruminations as to what Teresa might be doing, or the childish segues (""... speaking of humidity..."") which frequently, in the space of a single paragraph, sling the reader from Gettysburg to DC to NYC with only the most contrived and nonsensical connection.Someone should write a book about this guy. Sickles that is."
3,"5 stars for content, 1 for style","A fascinating story, poorly told. The writing is clumsy and ungrammatical at times. It interferes with, rather than tells, the story. This book also jumps around chronologically without rhyme or reason. And -- this is addressed to the publisher, not the author -- it cries out for a section of photographs, illustrations and maps."
3,It is what it is...,"For the price I paid, it was a no-brainer. I was hoping for a higher quality production i.e. it looks cheesy, but it is what it is... a bunch of boxing matches. Solid 3 out of 5..."
2,what happened?,"this album is awful. the songs are very disjointed and the arrangements terrible. each song is a collage of unrelated patterns, ideas, and isolated themes hastily glued together to impress each member's girlfriend and meet a deadline. you may as well download all the samples and mix them together with cool edit; the result would be the musical equivalent of one of these tracks and sound just as coherent. i assume if you're picking this re-release of their code666 debut up it is because you bought their demo, 'opera,' off of mp3.com and expect more of the same: symphonic riffing, complex arrangements, dissonant polyphony (thanks to a synthesized chamber ensemble),competent and quick lead guitar playing very black metal, barely melodic, hooks in individual 8 minute packages. i tell you though, what made that demo so brilliant is not here. none of it is. this is not the same band... this album gets a two only because it has three tracks off their demo on it as bonus tracks."
3,Not terribly original symphonic black metal,"Not a bad album, the musicianship is of a high caliber, but not a good album either. It's just that nothing really stands out for me. The vocals while impassioned, are pretty much generic black metal growls. The compositions recall Dimmu Borgir and Emperor, among others, many others.The problem with Ephel Duath is that they really have little voice of their own yet. Ocasionaly something original happens, be it some keyboard flourish or an odd drumbeat, but In general their sound is just too derivitive to deserve repeated listenings. I find myself getting bored fairly quickly."
4,Product is fine but received a mishandled box,"This product is exactly what it should be in terms of functionality. Unfortunately I received a box that smelled and looked like someone had spilled a lemon scented chemical on it. Not a major problem, but very annoying. This item was shipped by ACE hardware, not Amazon."
1,No tech support when it fails,It resets intermittently and I can't copy more than half a gig without it aborting. I've sent 4 emails to their tech support and still haven't received a response. I would not buy an Argosy product again.
1,And If you swing the OTHER way...,"and were planning on getting this for Jaime Pressly, just forget it. Poison Ivy 3 gives you all you need to see from her. The ""sex scene"" in this is utterly bad. They don't even bother to hide the fact that she's got panties on the whole time and is doing nothing but emotionless posing throughout. It's so unerotic that it's hardly even worth calling it a sex scene. You're better off searching for a d-load of that scene to see for yourself that it's a dud. Just plain dull, like the film. As you can see, this film's true fans are of another sort, which should tell you something."
4,JOEY PIGZA SWALLOWED THE KEY,Joey Pigza is a very different kind of story. It's about a boynamed Joey Pigza. I would give it a thumbs up. I don't recommend this book to everyone. This book at times can be sad and funney weird stuff. I really like this book. It was one ofthe best I have read!!!!
3,Joey Pigza Swallows the Key,In this book Joey Pigza can't sit still and loose control of himself. He has ADHD and so does his grandmother and the dad. Joey has to live with his grandmother and if he can't sit still in school he has to take special-ed class at the new school. Joey wants to go to a new school. I recommend this book because you might want to find out if he gets better. Joey Pigza Swallows the Key by Jack Gantos
4,What would Joey do?,"After a slow start, I finally got into reading Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key, the first in a series of acclaimed and award-winning books (winning both a Newbery Honor and National Book Award Finalist seal). Joey's misadventures ARE funny, but the recommended age of 10-up seems wrong somehow (hence the part when Joey accidentally cuts the tip of a fellow classmates nose off). The summary is simple: The trials of a young boy handling his ADD the best way he can, and with a touches of humor along the way. Simply put for a book that is anything but.Jack Gantos, author of the wonderful Hole in My Life, does well with the the first Joey book. The tale is very realistic in its potrayal of a young boy struggling with ADD. As a ""wired"" teen, I know how it feels, even though I'm not nearly as extreme as Joey. RecommendedR, your friendly nieghborhood reviewer."
4,Heather's review,"What I really liked about this book is it's real funny. I liked it because it was about a troublemaker. I liked to read about that kind of stuff. Because it makes me wonder what's going to happen next so it doesn't make me bored.Once there was a troublemaker named Joey. He swallowed his house key. Then cut off the tip of a girls nose. Named Maria, but her dad wouldn't let Joey apologize because he thought Joey hurt her more. So off to special - Ed he went. Then Joey had to go to the doctors in Pittsburg to test his brain to see what new medicine he needed. Will he get to go back to his old school?The type of reader, who would like this book, is someone who likes to read about troublemakers. This whole story is basically about kids that cause trouble. People, who likes reading about fiction, I would this book to. Mostly, because this story could have happened. So read the book. It's really a great book to read if you don't like to get bored while reading a story."
4,Student at Western Michigan University,"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key is definitely my favorite book we read in class. I could just totally picture as a boy I went to school with. Everyone thought he was so hyper and he never really had any friends. Throughout the whole book I kind of was saddened because I felt bad for Joey not being able to find the right medicine to make him normal. People should have accepted him for who he was instead of making such a big deal about him being hyper. It was definatley a story that many children today can relate to. I think that even if you dont enjoy reading you will enjoy this book because by the first page, Gantos has you sucked in. Its a book enjoyed by both children and adults! I HIGHLY RECCOMEND!"
3,yvette mohill read the book,this book was pretty darn good. all though i don't have add. i can sypthizes with joey. at frist i did like the book when it strarted out but as i kept reading i liked it more.i recomend give this book to kids who have the disorder.i cant wait to read the seqeul.
1,"Bad Stereotypes, false information","I was so excited to receive this book as a gift, but after reading it, I wasted no time getting online to write a review of the book. I am a special education administrator and am appauled at the inaccuracy and stereotypes in this book. How is this book supposed to teach tolerance and educate children about such disorders when the book only feeds misperceptions? Students cannot be sent to a special education classroom, in a basement, no less, because they ""aren't behaving"". I think it is malpractice to print a book that sterotypes and misinforms as much as this book does. I am so dissappointed."
3,joey pigza swalloed the key,joey is a hyper kid beause he had these meds but they didnt work so he didnt do anything right. the meds were supposed to calm him down. he was so out of control that he had to go to special-ed. in the book joey uts this girls nose off with scissors. but at the end of the book the doctor replaces his meds with a patch that keeps him calm.
5,Joey is great!,"I really enjoy the Joey books by Jack Gantos. It makes those of us who do not know anyone with ADHD understand what it is like. Joey has a great personality and try as he might, he still gets into trouble. He has an endearing quality to him and it comes through in the books. This book would be great for siblings of children with ADHD, although anyone would enjoy Joey's adventures."
5,Joey Rocks!!!!!!,"This book was awesome!! I loved it! It really showed what life is like living with ADD or living with someone who has the disease. It puts you in Joey's shoes and tells you how hard life is with ADD. Joey really is a great kid with a warm heart who is just trying to do the right thing. I can relate to Joey because I am very out of control, just like him. Definite 5 stars from me!!!!!!"
4,Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key by Jack Gantos,"Joey is the craziest, wild, and funniest character I've ever read about. If you like comedy, you should read this book. Joey's parents leave him with his grandma. His grandma is wired just like he is. She does some crazy things, like trap him in the refrigerator. Later on, Joey's mom comes back to live with him and his grandma. Joey never seems to be able to stay focused in school. He always gets into trouble, like trying to cut his fingernails in the pencil sharpener, and swallowing his house key. Because his behavior he is sent to Special Education. I'd say he has a pretty messed up family."
2,joey pigzas life.,Joey was a kid that was always in trouble.Every thing he did he got in trouble for.His mom left him to go chase his dad so he had to live with his grandma.Who was a little crazy.Joey finaly settled down at the end of the book because he wired through the whole book.
1,Not Original Recordings....Why use an Imitator?,"I can't speak for the rest of Orfeón Label Releases, but when it concerns Enrique Guzmán they are not releasing his original recordings. It is a travesty that Orfeón would market his songs and his image, when it's not even Enrique singing them. The plain and simple truth is that the real Enrique Guzmán does not sing in this album, but rather an imitator.As for the nostalgic value of the CD...I really can't argue against that, and that is the reason I am giving it one star; otherwise I would rate it zero stars....Don't be fooled like I was."
4,Exactly What You'd Expect,"They're a little brightly colored, so keep that in mind if buying for dark-framed glasses, but otherwise excellent quality. They are large (and may be trimmed down) so they should fit any pair of glasses and the adhesive is incredibly strong - once applied, these things will NOT come off."
2,"Cute idea, but needs improvement!","My three year old son asked for this for Christmas and was excited when Santa brought it. It is a really cute looking toy. However, it needs some improvement. The headphones with the attached cord are a pain to keep on and you can barely hear the audio. It would be a lot better with just a free-standing remote. Also, you really have to have the remote perfectly aligned with the car for it to work correctly. This toy can frustrate my son, who owns another remote control vehicle that works a lot better. Overall, he lost interest in it pretty quickly because of all of the problems. This toy needs some improvement. I would recommend investing in another remote control car."
2,"cute, but not worth it","This is a cute toy. However, the head piece is not adjustable so if it doesn't fit your child's head they can't wear it and hear the characters talking. The cars antena doesn't stay on very well. The remote is a little difficult to use too. I thought my 3 year old would love this and he gets frustrated because the head piece doesn't fit and won't stay on and he can't navigate the car very well with the remote. I wouldn't spend the money."
5,GREAT CD,"This is my first guitar instrumental CD and I totally love it. I can do anything while listening to it including computer, reading, writing, housework, driving etc. All the tracks on the CD are great."
5,enjoyable,"JUST A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS GUITAR MUSIC. PURE, SIMPLE PLEASURE. COMPRISED OF VARIOUS ARTISTS, EACH WITH THEIR OWN STYLE, IT IS A LOVELY RELAXING EXPERIENCE."
2,not my cup of tea,As a long time Dire Straits fan and the lack of anything new by the band I bought this thinking it might be worth a listen. That's about all I got out of it. The orchestra is good and the songs are accurate musically but it's a long way from the original. It won't fulfill my longing for the Dire Straits sound and therefore my recommendation is to get the original Dire Straits music instead.
4,Pretty Good - A return to form,"Yah, it might be a little too cliched with the dance beat, but this CD is great! Get the australian version with the bonus disk with some great remixes. If you are remotely into Hojo from the days of old, get this CD."
5,Great household addition,"When a product performs as advertised(effortlessly) it usually gets 5 Stars from me. This is no exception! I bought 8 and gave 5 of them as Stocking Stuffers. The number of appreciative telephone calls was rewarding. A happy wife is a big plus, too and I'm sure we'll be ordering more."
4,Perfect size for fried chicken !!!,This pot works great in the outdoor fryer! Does fisn and chicken perfectly. I would have goven it 5-stars if a thermometer was included !
1,a photocopy?,I couldn't even read it! This book came to me off of the photocopy machine.. with half the pages missing and the rest were very poor quality.Very disappointing for a $50 book. It will be returned.
1,Not all that it is said to be,I am a person that really hates to see bad reviews. Alot of you will most likely not listen to me. I truley did not like this book. I had an ornary taste whenver I read it. I am a seventh grader reading this book along with my classmates. So far I have not found one person whom enjoys this book. It it very slow paced.
5,AWESOME!!!,"My teachers made us read this book and do a lit circle on it.I thought the book was really good. I loved how the perspectiveof it was from the afterlife. Also, the storytellers wherevery descriptive and painted an amazing picture of her gloriouslife. This book was AMAZING!!! Thanks e.l. konigsburg!"
4,Very good documentary.,If you are a fan of Japanese culture and history then I would like to recommend the documentary. There is some great info here and Tom Cruise has absolutely nothing to do with it. Matter a fact if you like Tom Cruise you probably wont like this doc. That being said I found the Crab's with the face of a dead Samurai Warrior on their backs quite fascinating. There is also very good info about specific Samurai though out history and the role they played in Japanese history. Please if you are into Japan by all means check this out.Have a nice day. :)
4,New Women's Devotional Bible,The Bible is very well written and presented with thoughtful and inspiring devotionals. I downloaded the Bible to my Kindle and found it to be a great way to get my children engaged in Bible study. I highly recommend the product.
2,New women's devotional bible,I find this bible/ devotional difficult to navigate as an e-book. I like the content but skipping fromthe devotional to scripture and then finding my way back is a challenge.
5,I am Pleased,I am glad to say that I thought I had a problem with seller due to shipping but very VERY pleased to know that they contacted me to explain their shipping. I was the one who didnt understand not them. I would purchase with them again! They had very nice customer service!
5,"My son Age 6 loves Ben 10, great DVD","Can't go wrong with Ben 10, fighting Aliens, no ugly violence, great for kids 10 and under. Hours of entertainment if you have Season 1 as well as Season 2."
1,"Good Marketing, poor results","As others have indicated, the 'peel away' feature of this pan works ONLY if you leave a thick layer of paint in the pan-- and who would waste paint in that manner! If you leave a thin layer of paint to dry in the pan, you'll have to scrape the paint off with a scraper-- which took 20 minutes. With that said, this metal pan does rinse out better than any other paint tray I've used-- as long as the paint is wet. Nice marketing idea, poor execution, and poor results."
1,The batter sticks.,The batter sticks to the pan so hard that it was still hard to clean even after soaking it n the water for 2 hours!!But I guess this type of iron needs to be used/cooked several times.
1,Terrible reproduction with dubbed voices,"Sadly, this is a perfectly awful copy, possibly from a VHS tape. The voices are also dubbed rather than subtitled. It is actually All Region rather than Region 1, as the Amazon description says. Scola deserves better than he has gotten for his many fine films. Why doesn't Criterion do a Scola collection?"
1,The rape of a good Italian film,"I watched this horrible rendition of a badly dubbed, lousy VHS copy of an originally fine film and thanked God I didn't buy the DVD---which has to be a Chinese knockoff. This is what NetFlix is sending out to customers. I told them about it. No info on the disc but the title and that's it! Isn't this what the FBI wants to know about? I wonder if Sophia knows about this."
1,Rip-off! Next time I'll read the reviews!,"Because this was a remarkable and sensitive film, I purchased the DVD as soon as I saw it on Amazon. Big mistake!This is an inferior product that almost destroys this beautiful film! I feel ripped off. Now I see that there are many reviews here that warned the buyer to beware, but I didn't think to read them because I knew and loved the film and didn't stop to think that the DVD itself might be a poor product. I've learned my lesson. I started to show the DVD to my students and was horrified at what had been done to the film. Not only is the quality of the image unacceptable, but the amateurish dubbing destroys the performances of the wonderful actors. Terrible, and a great disservice to a beautiful work."
1,Is this legit?,Horrible bootleg version of wonderful film. Why do these people continue to release sub par video. Avoid Televista or Jef Video or Newstar
1,Deception,"The recording quality is so low that it seems as if it was transferred from an ordinary VHS and dubbed in English. Even the original soundtrack is not avaliable! It's an awful edition, which only leaves me feeling that I have I thrown away my money."
5,super awesome book by r.l.stine,ok i got this book from the oberlin library it was cool these 2 kids eat a candy bar that turns them into werewolf things overall it was cool i liked it
2,Good..........NOT!,IT's acttuly a book with a endding:They thought it was a cure bar but it was a curse bar
5,It doesn't get any better than this.....,You could use a thousand words to describe her voice but one will do......WOW!.....
1,Utter Nonsense,"A 5-year old wouldn't be fooled by the obvious model spaceships. Use even the slightest amount of critical thinking and you will see how delusional this farmer really is. Do a little research first: you will thank me for not wasting your money on this book. Too bad I couldn't select ""0 stars"" for a review."
5,Great movie,"I love old movies, I am starting to spend time find the ones I want. There are still more out there to find."
3,ripped up in no time,"If your dog is a nester, this is not the bed for you. My dog ripped up the design within a couple of weeks. Still works but I had to flip the bed upside down."
2,candy,"There were a few pieces of candy that were considered ""nostalgic"" but not many that I couldn't get at any store. Also the ""nostalgic"" candy was old and hard. Not like it should be. The price was decent and the delivery of the items was good. Just not impressed with the item."
2,Wordy!,"I am 10% along in this book and am considering putting it down, which I very seldom do. There is too much meaningless conversation and several grammatical and typo errors. This story needs more editing and a plot that captures my interest. To be fair, I'm going to read a bit more to see where it goes...."
5,Fantastic,"Jennifer Wilde is a fantastic author. Every book of hers that I have read has been a joy.Love Me, Marietta is exciting.Read it often."
4,Can't beat it for the money,"I was between this model and the Dewalt DW087K. I decided to go with the B&D; for 3 reasons:-It had all of the features I was looking for-Price-Reviews on AmazonI have used it for a little while now and it appears that this is a great unit for any homeowner or DIYer. One issue I have with the unit is that it is kinda bulky/awkwardly shaped, however the performance is not affected. Second issue is that the bracket seems kinda cheap, but it works. There are actually a few nice features of the bracket that I am a fan of (dial for vertical adjustment, dial to rotate laser).Also at the price point ($80) you can't beat it. The Dewalt DW087K at ($140) gives you what would appear to be a more rugged unit but works just the same. Unless you are working on a jobsite and need something that can take a beating I think the B&D; will work out just fine."
3,Good for very infrequent occasions,"I really am trying to love this level.. but I keep trying to use it in these certain situations that make it completely useless. I don't want to poke a bunch of holes in my freshly painted walls (the level lets you poke holes in walls to hang it).. so I am forced to stack it on chairs to get this thing to be of any use. What this thing should be able to do is point the horizontal laser up and down. So that you could have it set on a counter at 5 feet.. and point the horizontal laser up to the opposing wall at 7 feet. Unfortunately.. you can't even try to angle it up as the shielding will block the laser. Very frustrating.. I've found I've just stuck with my good ol' bubble level in 4 out of 5 cases.Also, the thing is super delicate when on its mounting platform.. any kind of touch will knock it off line and you have to re-finetune the positioning... it's just not that professional of a laser level if you ask me."
5,BDL310S Projected Crossfire Auto Level Laser,Shipped on time as promised. Took it to work (volunteer church construction) the next day. It is being used to install suspended ceiling. It can be hung on drywall with its unique pin device making it easy to layout the established height. I am very pleased with the product and its price.
2,Poor quality. Not the original as it was.,"I had two of the these hoses, purchased several years ago. This new hose, is hard not soft. It kinks up and offers little or no flexibility. I called Swan and found out that due to the economy etc, they changed the makeup of the hose to be cheaper and more attractive for buyers, also due to cost and oil prices etc. Really disappointed. The hose has the same name and features of the old, but it's cheap. Not the real thing. I will look elsewhere. Just glad that I did not buy two as I was thinking to do. Nothing against products being made in the USA, but if China makes a better one, I;m buying it. Why change when you have a great product, or did have a great product made with quality. Oh well."
1,King Kink,This hose is a joke. It's 75ft of pure kinking pleasure. I recommend this hose if your life is going way to smooth and you need something to get pissed off at.
2,KINKY Product,"When I purchased the Swan Soft and Supple Hose from Amazon, I believed I was getting a product that would be easy to manage in the yard and garden. Just the opposite is true; this hose kinks more often, in more places than any hose ever purchased. The quality of the hose seems adequate, but the constant kinking is very frustrating. I figure I cannot return it now, since I've used it for several weeks.John (Jack) Purcell"
1,Burn your money instead,"If you have money to burn on this garden hose then you will get more satisfaction from striking a match and burning it. This is an absolutely terrible product particularly when there are other good products in this price class. Buy something else or make a donation to a good charity. The swan warranty is also a joke... others (gilmur) simply say return it... Swan wants the ""original receipt"" to honor the warranty."
1,Piece of garbage,"I bought this hose to replace my 9 year old Flexon hose. The Flexon hose still works fine, but has a few kinks in it, so I decided to move it to my backyard where it won't be used much. Considering the cost, I was surprise at how thin and cheaply made this hose is. After only 2 months, this hose is in worse condition than my old hose. It already has some permanent kinks and a few gouges from being dragged across my driveway. I don't expect this hose to last through the summer. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Wish I had read it FIRST,"I was not angry about this book but do believe it should have a Warning!! I guess I am just super nieve because I didn't believe there was a children's book that would completely blow the whole tooth-fairy and magical creatures idea for the kids having it read to them. I was reading this to my 4 and 6 year old daughters at bedtime and had to stop mid-sentence when I realized the father in the book was admiting to taking the child's teeth and leaving the money...on BEHALF of the toothfairy. I had to think on my feet and come up with a story that looked like it matched up to the pictures. Not good.I could see this book working for an older child who is on the brink of not believing anymore, but even then, it's a bit of a stretch.My suggestion: Don't read this book to any child who still believes in the toothfairy, or any other magical character for that matter (Santa, perhaps)."
1,This book is a SPOILER for small children....,"Don't read this book to your child if they still believe in the Tooth Fairy (Easter Bunny, etc, etc). There aren't many childrens books that I haven't enjoyed - this one is the exception."
4,Good shaver,"I bought this about 3 weeks back, so far, it works well for me!I agree with one of the reviewers that it's difficut to shave around the neck! Other than that it is a great shaver...I would have liked it to hold better charge than 36 minutes, but then that's OK!Cleans well... no fuss! Not that expensive either..."
4,Breaking out of Stereotype,Kevin has reached into his heart and related the experiences of his mind and soul to create a work that will transcend us into eternity. This album is beautiful. Kevin takes ordinary life and show an eternal perspective and an appreciation for the One who thought all this up. This is not a safe album. Enjoy it.
4,"Intelligent, Well-Crafted Pop/Rock","I enjoy quite a bit of DC Talk's music and particularly like Kevin Max's unique vocals and so am quite pleased with this well-crafted album. The comparisons to Bono are warranted, but Max is much more than a clone: he has both range and nuance and uses them well. The songwriting is strong, the lyrics are intelligent and only occasionally overreaching, and the musicianship is top-notch. The production of Adrian Belew is dense but never gratuitous, and you cannot go wrong with players such as Tony Levin (bass) and Matt Chamberlain (drums). An enjoyable and intriguing listen."
3,OK,"As a big DC Talk fan, I have been rather disappointed with the solo efforts of the members.Kevin Max certainly has an outstanding voice and he is quite a poet. That being said, this CD is merely OK. I think 'Be' is quite a good song.It is really quite sad as DC Talk was certainly one of the most phenomenol bands that I have ever heard. The synergy of the three members is incredible. Sadly, they do not have the same thing going with their solo works."
3,"Cute in Nursery, but damaged","This item works perfect in my nursery, it really is very cute and ties the jungle/safari theme together, however, the shade was dented when I opened the packaging.I've 'popped' the dent out a few times, but it keeps going back in. There are also several scratches/ nicks in the paint of the lamp base. It seems well made, but not really well handled. I know it will show wear and tear eventually, but I am disappointed that it wasn't in brand new shape from the beginning.I've turned the dent in the shade to the back and will just have to deal with always popping it back out."
1,Thugs in a nightmarish world,"Reading this book is like stepping into a nightmare. The male characters are all thugs; the females have been reduced to orifices. Thuggish behavior is described in thuggish language. I quit reading round about page 225 when one of the characters is getting his ears cut off with a chain saw. In sixty years of avid reading, I have not come across anything as tasteless and offensive as this book.PS. In the UK, being ""pissed"" means being drunk, not angry.( I'd hate to think that US readers are thinking that these characters are going around feeling angry all the time!)"
5,"Bimey! Quite the Smashing Read, Innit?","If you cannot handle the small challenge of reading some low-brow British slang, if you cannot glean the meaning of the words from the subject matter and figure out what it going on, then you are just not going to get it, are ya? But give it some time & effort, and you've got yourself a ""cheeky"" page turner full of mystery and murky surprises. And oh! How I loved the ending. Hit me where I least expected it! Should have seen it coming, but I didn't did I? I laughed out loud! This is a good 'in!Got it on me Amazon Kindle, didn't I? So happy, I be goin' back for more just to see what old Charlie has got in store for me. I can take it-whatever he dishes out-with a smile. He's a sly one, that Charlie is...always thinking ahead. And so many books, so affordable for a Summer read on me Kindle! Ta!"
1,More Problems Than GT3,"I rented GT3 because I knew it was going to be a rainy weekend. But I never knew the problems I would have with it. First, I put the game in and started to get the licences. As few people said on other reviews it is frustrating and unrealistic. I finally got through 2 licences with alot of problems. I mean it is not humanly possible to complete the licences with all gold or any gold for that matter. Then I was tired so I went to bed and woke up to play more GT4. Loading the game is the easy part right. WRONG! I put the memory card in and it froze up on me. I tried different things to resolve the problem but I assume its the game. Im really suggesting NOT to buy this game. Buy GT3 instead."
1,Will this ever be released?,"I pre-ordered this game in February, and am beginning to wonder if I will ever get it. They've changed the release date at least 3 times since I ordered, and I just checked and noticed that they have delayed it AGAIN. I don't know if it's a tactic or there are problems with it, but if I don't get it in time for Christmas, I will be cancelling my order."
1,the game is not that good,1. the cars don't drive the same as GT3 Aspect.that is way i gave it (1) star.the game is not worth the $$$.
2,This is not good!,"I cannot believe they have delayed this game for a year, to announce two months prior to its release that it will not be online compatible. Absolutely rediculous. I pre-ordered the game almost 9 months ago and can't wait to get my refund. That was the main attraction of this game. Hold off and buy it when they come out with a second online version."
5,Graphics will blow your Mind,"While this game isnt as fun to play as new racing games like Midnight Club 3: DUB edition. But if you like releastic racing, then this game is a must. Gameplay is releastic and graphics, well..they just make you wonder about human creative ability. If you're a fan, then definitly recomended that you play this racing game. It's unquestionably the most releastic and greatest simulation racing game ever created."
4,Better Cars Please,"They really could added more cars on GT3, at least more on the BMW, one car that stinks come on BMW are the best cars out their at least put better cars on their that people would enjoy. Really I hope GT4 will be a sweet game ect. well the rest of the game is a worth buying. Buy it"
4,Wow its Hard,"I thouht that it would be easy,but I was wrong.It's OK but hard I rented it and I tried to do GT mode but you need a memory card it's so weird.It's very realistic .I hoped this helped."
5,I may actually buy PS2,"OK, here's the deal: NEVER compare NFS: Undegraound and GT series...the reasons? Well, one of them is cant get the rear wheels to spin out even with a RWD car and traction controll off in NFS. GT is a different story. I remember that I played GT2 for 6 months every day I had to try every single car in the game... (and I had to sell my PS one). NFS was great, but there was something missing- any hint of realism and aboiut 200 cars. And I don't really like rice cars. GT4 has to offer far more than any other game on any other platform. It is going to be a huge hit. With or without online play.There is only one next step. Buying an actual car and trying to race it."
2,Clapping for Doughty,"Five stars for Doughty! I watched the VT because I like the female actresses so much, but the plot cut women short.I was very impressed with the sensitivity and believability portrayed by Kenny Doughty. He played his part perfectly in an understated way, which made the flick a somewhat painful joke on women, despite 3 major lead female actresses through whom the film intended to show female solidarity."
5,Love It!!,"Love the show and love the game. I find it to be fun and challenging. I have had to use walkthroughs (http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=673)to figure somethings out but overall, it rocks. I love being the detective and going to trail. It has to be a little difficult or it would not be fun. It is just like the show right down to the wise cracks. As for the computer requirements it says on the box Windows XP only. When buying computer games you really have to be careful and read the requirements carefully! As for the crashes this happens when you play games that require a lot of space and you do not have much left on your computer. Try running it with limited graphics and sound if you really want to play. Or, delete some old game on your computer your are not playing. Most people will not have problems"
2,boring game,"this game is too hard. i interviewed everyone, collected any evidence that was sitting around. had it analyzed and still didn't have enough to arrest someone. i don't know what to do with it."
1,Don't waste your money!,Bought this game 3 days ago. BIG fan of L & O. At first there were black shapes diagonally across the screen in navigation mode. Called UBI Soft and was told I had to roll back my video driver. This entailed calling support at Nvidea and talking to some guy in India who I couldn't understand. He asked me if there was someone else at home he could talk to!!! Wanted to play so bad that I actually did this! Game worked for approximately 1/2 hour and crashed. Now my computer is so messed up - did something to Quick Time and Java I think. This game was exactly what I was looking for and I'm just sick that it won't play. My CPU far exceeded the requirements for this game.
4,Well worth the price,"Yes, Villa Lobos has an odd reputation, and string quartets don't come to mind as his forte. Yet, as the other reviewers have pointed out, these are fine quartets that deserve a place in a serious collection of 20th century chamber music.While I don't know that I would rate them equal to Bartok, they are certainly worth careful and repeated listening. And, the price is certainly right."
3,How old is your home??,"I bought this product to hang pictures and shelves in the new home my wife and I were about to make settlement on. The home is about 90 years old, and a number of the walls are plaster, not dry wall. The level works well enough to use, although hanging it on the wall as advertised leaves a pin hole behind.The stud finder worked great on the newer replacement walls, but malfunctions when attempted to use on plaster walls. It reads the entire wall as one big stud.If you have a newer home, I can see this product working great for you; but if your home is older, I might suggest going with something else."
1,"Hard to use, does not find studs reliably","I usually spend about 20 minus to find a single stud with it, that is because the stud might appear when I am moving from one side and not from the other or I just got some false-positives. I noticed that if I press harder against the wall it does little better job, but then it is hard to move it across the wall while keeping same pressure.The laser works well, no complaints there.Bottom line, I would not buy it again."
3,"not bad, but yet not fantastic","Yes, Alicia Keys has all there is to start a successfull career in music business - young, gifted and beautiful. But still - her first album to me seems to be a bit overrated. Her arrangements are somehow confusing, disturbing, they don't always match the songs.Lately I saw her in a TV show, singing unplugged. Wow, it was a lot better than from her CD ... Sorry!"
4,Wonderful sounds...,"When I got this CD I knew that I loved the singles that are all over the radio, but a person soon learns there is a lot more to Alicia Keys. There is a taste of flamenco in 'Mr. Man', smooth soul in 'Butterflies', and a classical touch in 'Piano and 1' all great examples showcasing the many places she comes from while keeping herself rooted in a firm soulful R&B foundation. She continues creating beautiful new sounds every time. There is a wonderful current of electricity running through every song that makes you eager for each track to last and last."
1,a bad CD,"i thought most of the tracks would be be at the same level as ""fallin"", but i was really wrong. All the traks besides ""fallin"" were really bad and i skipped over all them!The CD was a bit depressing and she never used her voice the way she did in her current single! i recomend not buying this CD unless you like very slow and uneventful music"
4,You go girl!!,"Personally i really like this youbg ladys work.I am really feelin this whole disc because she has her own style and it works for her.She is so classy ,so intelligent and confident and i think y'all should hook this cd up!!"
1,NOT ALL THAT,"Alicia's debut album is weaker than her sophomore, FALLIN'is an overplayed song, not for the clever lyrics but for her voice wich I must agree is gifted. But After ROCK WITH U and A WOMAN'S WORTH, this album is pure boreness, is not even classy like those boring SADE albums, this is cheap and boring, if you want to buy a KEYS album buy her DIARY one, this is rush into the market one. HOW COME YOU CALL ME is another weak track. And is a fact that only FALLIN and A WOMAN'S WORTH made into the top 10...way different from DIARY wich manage 4 top 40 that's way better."
2,Abolish the Grammys...,"This album won 5 (count 'em) FIVE... Grammys?!?!? India.Arie, on the other hand, who is INFINITELY more talented, creative, original, and versatile won none... OK... Hopefully, the ""Curse of the Best New Artist"" (Hey, Hootie, how ya doin'?!?) will kick in with this girl, because I'm sick of her self-righteousness. If I wanted to hear nauseatingly self-absorbed people accept awards, I'd rather hear Bono or Alanis... at least they're talented artists. Forget this chick's generic, VH1-friendly, M.O.R. soul-paup... if you're a fan of Stax Volt, Motown, Hi Records, and Lady Day, get Jill Scott or India.Arie, instead. If, however, you think Train, N'Sync, Cristina, and Creed are Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame material, get this. And, good God, I feel sorry for you!"
1,"THE MORE YOU HEAR THIS CD,THE MORE YOU HATE IT!","In June 2001,I was raving about Alicia Keys like the next man.I,like everybody,thought that she was the best thing since white bread,well months later,I've came to the conclusion that Keys and her overrated debut,""Songs In A Minor"" get on my last nerves!After a while,""Songs In A Minor"" becomes annoying and redunant.And with the exception of a few numbers(""Rock With You""...""Troubles""...""Mr. Man""),the songs BLOW!The production-for the most part-is OFF and her piano skills aren't that great.""Girlfriend"" sounds like a Britney Spearssong with a hip hop beat.""Fallin'"" sounds like a Mariah Carey outake.And even ""Trouble"" and ""A Woman's Worth"" come off likeMary J. Blige wannabes.This CD isn't all of that.This is what I call Prada Soul.Glossy,heavily marketed R&B; that tries to hide under a fake REAL SOUL banter.Unexposed ""TRL"" fans might go ga-ga over this but for real soul fans-this isn't cutting it..."
5,Words can't describe how great this CD is,"I bought Songs in A Minor about 4 months ago and I'm mad at myself for not buying it the day it came out. THIS IS THE GREATEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD!!!! You know how some CDs you don't listen to all the way through? You'll listen to the first 2 songs, then skip to #5, then #8...something like that. No. With Songs in A Minor you will have no choice but to listen to and love all the songs because they're just that good. I have a hard time picking my favorites because they're all good. I guess my top five favs would be: How Come You Don't Call Me, Fallin', Rock Wit U, Jane Doe, and Never Felt This Way. If you have not bought this CD yet, do yourself a favor and go get it right now! You will not be disappointed. I absolutely CANNOT wait until her next CD comes out."
4,young blues,"Mature, yet careful not to go beyond her 19 years of her experience... This is a smart piece filled with soul. Finally a young performer with some talent that will translate into many more good albums for all to enjoy. Just sit back and listen its jazz funk rhythm and blues all at once without the least bit of incoherent confusion that many artists get trapped in."
2,5 grammies?,"O.K. Alicia Keys is a great singer, is beautiful and plays the piano very well. This c.d. just isn't very good. It definatly doesn't deserve 5 grammies! I bought the c.d. because of Fallin' and was disappointed by the rest of the songs. They were all boring and sounded the same (except for Fallin'). If you like pure R&B and jazz a lot, you might like the c.d., but for all of you who like a little pop or a nice beat, I wouldn't get this c.d. The only reason why I liked Fallin' is because it had a little bit of a beat and she has a voice that shines in it. Don't let the song Fallin' fool you. Listen to some other songs before getting it."
2,She's OK but...,"She is no Jill Scott. Not even the same league as India Arie!! I was very excited to hear Fallin. That was a great cut. I even like the song about a womans worth. However, I listened to the entire CD at a friend house and was totally demotivated to go and buy it. She is way over hyped. Probabaly due to the fact that she is very attractive, and has Clive Davis backing her, who has mainstreamed the heck out of her. Perhaps too soon. She is good musician, obviously young. I do believe she will improve over time.Pop lovers will definitely drool all over her. R&B lovers will deal with her. And neo soul lovers...borrow the CD from someone else and give it back."
5,Women are on the rise!,I bouught this album the day it came out. I suspected that Alicia Keys' album would be great and it was. Every last song on it is worth taking a moment to listened to. Alicia Keys is a Young lady with many talents. She plays the Piano really well and she can really sing. I love this album and would recommend anyone to go out and get it now. Women are on the rise and are blowing up in the music industry!
3,Fantastic Talent But Needs to Mature,"She has the all the talent and musical skills that any great artist could hope for. She is destined to be a giant. Unfortunately her approach to the material is marred by some immaturity that reflects itself in her apparent need to resort to ""potty mouth"" as a way to of showing that she is relevant and real. This is certainly in vogue right now with many young artist ( and some older one's too) but her problem is that she simply has too much class to effectively pull if off. She sounds uncomfortable cussing - and she should. Maybe next time she'll let her voice and muscianship speak for her and depend less on four letter words to impress."
2,Alicia missed the Keys,"With the backing of a legend such as Clive Davis (who is responsible for the career of Whitney Houston, and the resurgance of Santana) we would expect more than what we find here.Ms. Keys album has one really fine single ""Fallin"" on the album. The rest is of a quality that does not warrant the attention given this album. Her voice is somewhat stringent, her lyrics uninspired. The album compares poorly to Macy Gray's ""On How Life Is"". As to her being both a singer and an accomplished pianist, I will stay with Shirley Horn who can get more out of her pauses than Ms. Keys can from her caterwalling."
2,Alicia Keys/Songs in a Minor,"I've listened to this CD about 20 times now and I still don't see what's so special about Alicia Keys. To me she's totally overrated. ""Fallin'"" is a great song but next to that only a few songs are actually good on here. The only standouts are ""girlfriend"", ""how come you don't call me"", and ""goodbye."" That's it. The rest of the album is filler.Sure, Alicia Keys is talented. Sure she writes, produces, and plays the keys but that won't save her. SONGS IN A MINOR is poorly produced. The album drags, further and further into a deep hole. Lyrically, nothing special there either. No question Alicia's got the talent but it's not put to good use on here.If you're looking for an R&B album that satisfies check out Blu Cantrell's SO BLU. Wait until this minor grows up a bit."
1,Totally overrated,"As a pawn in Clive Davis' game to get J Records on the map, I guess Alicia Keys serves her purpose. As the best album/artist this year?? Not at all... Yes she has talent- and that should always be acknowledged and celebrated, but she is totally not the calibur that she is being hyped up to be. This is an alright 1st album (with about only 2 songs that move me)and hopefully she will experiment with music and improve as she progresses in her career. It is something else what a pretty face and a lot of backing can do for someone. I hope she makes the most of of this situation because it won't last for her too long..."
2,OverRated Work,Alicia Keys is not all that on wax. Her album is so mediocre. There is nothing special about it. What's all the fuss for? Is it because she can play a few tunes on the piano? I bought her cd in Aug sometime and haven't paid it no mind since. Im so curious to see what she will do on her next album. Hopefully everyone wont be so blinded by her sophmore effort that they wont be able to give a realistic opinion. One Love
4,NO Lyrics!!??,"I enjoy this CD and I cannot add to what has already been said, however, I am disappointed that the lyrics were not included in the sleeve. One reason to purchase CD's instead of burning them is to support the artist and HAVE the lyrics to the songs on the CD. Alicia is not the only artist to have this short coming. I recently purchased nine new CD's from Amazon, (nearly all were this year's grammy winners) and not a single sleeve included lyrics. I feel short-changed!"
4,nice,"Just got the cd today, put in the disk and at first I really wasn't impressed. The first song is just OKAY to me, and, somewhat concerned, I hoped the rest of the cd was better. She rescues herself real quick. The Prince cover is on point and then it just gets better from there. I was apprehensive about getting this cd because I wasn't too impressed by the other album to come out by clive's label(i won't name name's) but this has lived up to my expectations and then some"
3,"Impressive, but hyped up a bit.","What I love about this album is Alicia's very soulful singing skills. I love how she integrates classical with R&B and Hip-Hop even; however, this album has been hyped up quite a bit. Hyped up albums tend to give you the expectation that you're going to like it a lot, so on that note I wasn't pleased. It took a while to get into this album, but once you do, you'll hail A.Keys as a creative force just as much as a performer."
1,Bamboozled!,"I saw Alicia Keyes on Oprah last year and was really impressed with her presentation on the show. I couldn't wait to get her CD which was due to be released the following week. Boy, was I disappointed when I finally purchased it. This work is so juvenille. I can't understand all of the hoopla over this debut. I think the fact that she is a Clive Davis protege won her all of those Grammy's and other awards which should have gone to India Arie (a far better talent). Besides Fallin' and How Come You Don't Call Me ( which is a Prince remake), the rest of it is, well fallin'. This CD is not the mover and shaker the industry is making it out to be. In all honesty, my 12 year old daughter who is a published poet has written deeper lyrics than Ms. Keyes. Regretfully, the CD is quite pitiful."
4,nice,"I've owned this CD since she came out with it, and I really liked it. Sure some of the songs are covers or contains some elements of other artist's music, but name an artist or group who has never done that before and I will be surprised. Bands like Radiohead or singers like D'Angelo have done the same. That doesn't mean that they don't have talent.People who say that Alicia Keys can't sing or doesn't play the piano that well don't know what they are talking about. ""Patternisms""?? Song structure maybe?? Do you expect a concerto from her for pete's sake?? Sure, with some practice, a novice could play ""Never Felt This Way"", but try singing at the same time!! Yah I know, it's hard right? Now try singing and playing ""Butterflyz"". Thought so. So to say she doesn't have talent really is a false, ignorant statement. I just felt that I had to support her, I think she sings and plays the piano beautifully. Don't listen to these ig'nant fools"
3,"NICE VOICE, BAD CHOICE OF MUSIC","I like Alicia Keys voice & her first hit song, but after that the other songs are not a good choice to show off her talents. Maybe never CD!"
5,All nay sayers can eat crow !,"Not too often does someone come along who can sing and play an insrtument, at the same time ! And now she has 5 Grammys to her credit. Only other female to accomplish this, Lauryn Hill another great artist. So to all those who thought this album would do so well, EAT CROW ! ! !"
4,Very good compilation of the escence of SE Asia,"No book can have a real big guide to travel SE Asia, or any continent. Too much information for just one book.But this one has a great seleccion of sumarizzed info.You can alwways criticize this kind of books as they try to cover too much, but for me, the selection of countries information, quantity and importance of data for each country, and Seleccion of cities, is great."
4,4 Stars but be careful why you buy the unit.,"I thought it would play any DVD from anywhere in the world because of the Pal/Secam right? No. That's only the TV you can play your DVD's on. So yeah, you could travel with it, just bring your DVD's with you, because that's all that's gonna play on them. Major bummer."
2,Warning Not Compatible with DISH or DIRECTV,"When I first got this and set it up I was excited and it worked well. However, if you have DISH or DIRECTV their receivers will not communicate with it. I think the problem is with their receivers and not the recorder though. DISH and DIRECTV technology has not caught up to be compatible with DVD recorders."
2,Works but annoying.,"I specifically bought it because it has a Firewire input connection and I THOUGHT I could record my home movies from my JVC digital video camera as well as my old VHS home movies. It has an annoying flaw when the camera runs out of tape! If I end the recording session AFTER the tape ends, the recorder goes south and displays the status “Stopping” continuously until I finally give up and power off the recorder. The disc appears blank when I try to play it which leads me to believe the file wasn’t properly closed. If I end the recording session BEFORE the tape ends, the recorder properly closes the file and the disc will play - except for the missing minutes or seconds left on the tape! Also, I’m unable to record using the 1 hour HQ mode from the Firewire input but I haven’t experimented with other inputs or disc as of yet."
3,Need a replacement drive,"Hi, bought mine a year ago.... now, the tray won't come out. Grrr.... anyone know what LiteOn DVD+-R/W model would work as a replacement? (I could work with the front bezel off... he he he, but that's not good) The PC dvd recorders here are just cheap anyway.The unit itself is solid... I even can record blindly (without a TV) he he he... a larger than normal oversample space though. Big, like 10-15% I think."
4,Comprehensive for a little written on subject,"Besides the professionalism with getting the product as quickly as possible, and in excellent condition, this book is a must for any serious student. It is comprehensive, and what makes it stand out is the fact that you don't see a lot of this material in print; let alone in a newer book. The writing style is relaxed, and everything is spelled out very clearly, including facets that don't normally get mentioned.Kudos!"
2,Nothing new and better books available.,"The title and cover of the book gives a promising outlook of a fascinating subject of which published material is scant.Sadly the book itself contains no new information and is substantially just re-worded material available from other books whose content is also more comprehensive and better presented.The book does not go into anymore than a surface explanation of techniques and it seems they have created a book by compiling scattered fragments from the work of others.To their credit the authors do at the outset state that the books content is not original and has been taken from other sources.Still, for those wanting more concise instructions and a better presentation of this topic, suitable material can be found in Franz Bardon's 'Initiation into Hermetics' and Alexandra David-Neel's 'Magic and Mystery in Tibet'."
5,A great new book,"A really great book, that is worth it's weight in gold. The topic is complicated but in this book it is made as clear and simple as it can be. For the serious students of magic, this book is a must."
2,Too big for vanity hole,"I just received this very attractive faucet, but unfortunately the description does not indicate the diameter of the pipe, and it is too large for the single hole of my vanity!!"
1,No Flash,"The ibook g4 powerpc stinks! I can't download flash player or html5 or antything! I can't watch videos or do anything that requires flash plugins! The internet goes slow and I can't get anything else because it has a powerpc processor and here's one thing you readers should know: Don't ever get a powerpc processor, you can't get chrome, flash or anything. This is crazy! The best internet you can get is Firefox 3.0 and it goes really slow. If you plan on watching videos on your computer do NOT get this, it won't let you and you can't download the plugins because it's not for powerpcs and the archived flash players for powerpcs don't work. Do NOT get this!"
4,Summary of Learning how to learn,"Very systematic approach of teaching learning how to learn.Part one : motivate you to learn ""Preparation for learning"" Part two : teach you to learn """"Seven ways of learning"" Part three : practise your learning ""Maximizing Learning""The look and feel are very good. You can find out the editing of the book made you read the book very comfortable."
4,"Love the Bat Boy, Save the Bat Boy","I bought this CD based on reading review after review praising the show. I was not disappointed. A very modern score performed by some strong voices is always a welcome addition to my collection. While I think I need to listen to it a few more times to get all the jokes, some of it is very funny. More than that, though, this is simply a strong score with some fantastic songs, most notably: Three Bedroom House, Let Me Walk Among You, A Joyful Noise and my personal favorite - Children, Children. The only reason I gave this CD 4 stars is because the quality of the recording isn't what it should be - it sounded kind of muffled at times to me. I thought it might be my stereo, but another CD proved me wrong quickly. If you like intelligent, humorous musicals with some strong music, I do recommend this CD."
4,Great and Original!!,"I picked up this soundtrack because I will be in the musical this fall, and hadn't heard of it before a month ago. I was very pleasently surprised by the dark humor, and the sometimes upbeat, somtimes haunting tracks. Tracks like ""A Home for You,"" ""Comfot and Joy"" and ""Three Bedroom House"" show the large range of genre this musical encompasses. There is so much to enjoy with this soundtrack, and kept me enthralled through the whole thing. I was also happy to see that the soundtrack does not ruin any surprises about the musical itself, but a listener who is unfamiliar with the show can still enjoy it.The only thing that bothers me about this soundtrack is that there are many lyrical changes in the soundtrack. (I hate that.) But I would say that this is an original, enjoyable and engrossing soundtrac. It will make you want to see the show live."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"I went to go see BatBoy with a friend of mine several days before it closed, and was not extremely enthusiastic about it - after all, it's about a BATboy - until I saw it.....the music is incredible, with a lot reminding you of a rocky horror show or rent - heavy use of electric guitars, etc. Not at all like a Les Miz or a Jekyll and Hyde, so if you're the type of person who wants to sit down and become absorbed in the dramatic play, this wouldn't be the soundtrack to buy, but if you're into rock n roll I would say go for it!!!! I loved all the Broadway plays; Les Miz, Jekyll and Hyde, Rent, and BatBoy, but I have to say that they are all extremely different. Deven May has an incredible voice, as do all the other singers - it's a shame that it had to close."
4,"NICE UNIT, EASY TO USE",WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT THIS IS THE FACT I CAN LIE IN BED AND LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS AND NAVIGATE THE BUTTONS IN THE DARK. IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE BUTTONS ARE NOT REALLY TINY AS IS THE CASE IN MANY OTHER CD PLAYERS.THE COLORS ARE ATTRACTIVE AND IT IS WELL MADE.ONLY PROBLEM IS I WISH IT WENT BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE LAST IN THE AUDIO BOOK.
5,a true blues innovator,"The greatest thing about Chris Whitley's music is you never know exactly what you're going to get - only that it will be rooted in blues, interesting and immensely soulful. That is still the case with Rocket House. Much has been made of the fact that Whitley employs electronic insrumentation on this album, but the synthesized beats and other ""techno"" sounds are very subdued and serve only to give the songs a more atmospheric mood. Whitley's silky, soulful voice and strong guitar playing stay front and center, as they should. The man also writes great songs. I hope this record reaches a younger audience who might be drawn in by the electronica, then hooked on the soul. A fantastic record."
5,Likeable characters enrich a hilarious romance!,"Kasey Michaels' books are a hit-and-miss proposition for me. Some, I absolutely LOVE. Others, I find the characters self-centered and annoying. Luckily, ""This Can't Be Love"" is of the former variety.All the characters in this book are extremely likeable (with the exception of those that aren't supposed to be!). Both the major and minor characters are reasonably well-developed. And this book is hilarious! I laughed out loud while reading it.Michaels also does a good job of developing the romance between Molly and Dom -- Molly especially really has to work through some issues. Those issues are nothing new in romances -- something Michaels actuallly pokes fun at by calling Molly a ""textbook case."" Still, Molly's so much fun, and so loving, that you're rooting for her the entire time.A great read I couldn't put down!"
2,3 episodes missing!,"This season is drawn out and when you get to disc 3, the reverse side is a duplicate of the front side. Thus, three episodes are missing. And, what is with the Portugese subtitles???????"
2,No spanish subtitlles,"Upset because the this season did not have spanish subtittles. I was planning to give it as a gift to my mother, who is peruvian and understand very little English. I guess Warner forgot that there are many fans of Dallas in South-America, who understand very little English and could not find a Region 4 (Latin-America) DVD of Dallas, and that latins are the first minority in the US.From 6th to the 14th seasons, there are not spanish subtittles at all. What a shame for Warner"
3,DALLAS 6TH SEASON,Video quality poor and transmission fails several times in some of the episodes. Sound and video coordination is also below expectation
4,The best of dallas,"Personally, i think this is one of the best season. It starts of pretty slow but by the second episode every thing falls in place. The fight for Ewing oil, holly harwood, katherine, mark graison and a whole lot of suppoing characters!! Sue ellen and jr's marriage_falling back into her drinking pattern... great acting by the characters. By this point all the actors had become comfortable in their character's skin. I absolutely luv,luv this season and i advice every old and new fan of dallas to get this season. This is when dallas was at its peak."
2,Women under the influence,"Book was very 'DRY' in the reading. It is informative, but the way that it was written was a bit too much. Author uses long vague descriptions before you finally understand what they are trying to say. Like using 500 words when 10 words would have explained the same thing in a better way."
4,Chatty Wyatt,"My 3-year old, who doesn't know how to stop talking, loves this book--especially the page about why does Grandma have blue hair? Text is a real grabber for kids attention and illustrations are delightfully classic."
3,A little pricey,I like glass jars but wish they could be a lower price. I can get 12 pint canning jars for $6 so I don't understand why these have to be so expensive. Would rate better if the price was lower.
2,"Ok, I guess I didn't read the into ...","Its an ok story......for a YA or kid. But, as an adult, I found it ""ok"". Its told in a kids perspective...and then it just ends. See ya-bye going home done. Just not my thing I guess."
4,nice glasses,very stylish for safety glasses. My uncle had to order a pair as soon as he saw mine. They fit well and stay in place better than what my company provides too.
5,Great Book,"I hadn't read much of Pournelle or Niven for several years, but I enjoyed The Burning City enough that I have been re-reading their other books.I found it thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Sorry Jerry,"Boy, this review is hard to do as Pournelle is a favorite author of mine, and I have read some of the Porunell/Niven collaborations many times. Unfortunately, The Burning City will not be on my re-read list. The plot premise is good, but the moral was too ""in your face"". The characters were flat, the dialog (? was there dialog), and adjectives were lacking. Sorry fellas."
1,I was disappointed,"Niven's work has been slipping for years, and I think this is a prime example. He just wrote a novel set on a trading route a couple of years ago. Has he become so unimaginative that he has to recylcle the same device? There were too many elements that came from other places."
1,What a disappointment.,"Poorly elaborated characters, weak plot, silly and primitive dialogue, hackneyed fantasy devices, and no real conflict...it's hard to believe this is the same duo who wrote such exciting stories in the past. I've always been a big fan, but a clever premise and world structure doesn't carry this insipid story very far. I'm glad I won't have to wait for the sequels to this dog."
1,"I wanted it to be good, but it wasn't","Niven has taken his previous worst book ""Destiny's Road"", and rewritten it in a new context. The characters are the same, the journey is the same, and the disjointed and dead ended plot line writing style is the same.Aweful...just aweful. This is from a reader who thinks Niven's previous work is some of the definitive Science Fiction works in existance."
1,get to the point!,"I kept waiting for the Niven and Pournelle magc that I have enjoyed so many times before. It never showed up. This book goes on and on and on. Finally, I dozed off and awoke with something else to read."
1,still cannot figure this book out,"I have read all the reviews, and tried repeatedly to read this book. I still cannot figure out this book. It is written in a strange manner, as if the authors are trying NOT to describe things in any comprehensible way. The characters are NOT interesting, there is NO storyline, and events are described so as to be NOT comprehensible. I cannot understand how any of the positive reviews are serious. I keep trying to read this book, but it is not engaging. Is it possible that the authors purposefully wrote it as an exercise in crafting an incomprehensible story? If so, why should I read it. I keep trying to care about the main character, or any characters... no dice."
3,SLOW START BUT A DECENT READ,"There is no doubt that Larry Neven and Jerry Pournelle are two extremely talented writers that have demonstrated they can work magic together. THE BURNING CITY isn't in the same class as THE MOTE IN GODS EYE but after a slow start it turns out to be a fairly entertaining little story.Be warned though it does start slow, very slow. It is worth struggling through the first couple of hundred of pages, although sometimes you have to wonder.The land they create is in our distant past where magic is still viable, gods aren't just myth and Atlantis is real, or at least it was until its destroyed. The characters and their culture are unique and sometimes bizarre but once you get accustom to them interesting and enjoyable to follow.Not their best but there is a lot worst. I RECOMMED it but be advised it does take some work on the readers part to get past the initial groundwork they lay and into the meat of the story."
2,Disappointed,"After reading all of Niven and Pournelle's collaborations over the years I was excited to see this book on the shelf. Unfortunately, there just isn't much to this book. The theme of the story is an obvious attempt to introduce social commentary about our present-day society, which is fine, but it just wasn't interesting. No profound thoughts are shared and there are no plot twists to keep you hanging on. It's very predictable and the characters forgettable.In fact, the entire story can be read in the first 3 paragraphs of Amazon's editorial review. All other details are superfluous.Maybe they were just due a mediocre one. They've had so many that were phenomenal."
4,The Great CHARLES BROWN on some rare tracks,This CD contains 2 Charles Brown recordings which are unavailable elsewhere (Crystal Ball / My Budding Rose) and is a terrific sampling of modern New Orleans blues and R&B.;Charles Brown was an American Treasure on the level of Ray Charles and Robert Johnson and this is a must for his collectors.Art Neville (the Neville Brothers) turns in some great tunesincluding a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan (Another Blues Stringer). Don't Hesitate - great stuff!
2,pricing!,"I'm interested in taking a look, as I'm always on the hunt for a new and better translation, but without even a preview of a single page, it's hard for me to be willing to pay almost $1000 for it. I think the lack of a preview, combined with an astronomical price point make this a difficult book to give any serious consideration. And no, b/c of that, I have *not* actually read a single page of it."
1,This is a soofee translation,"Beware of this book, it is the soofee way of introducing their version of the Qur'an. Full of errors. Stay away."
5,The end of the Amazon trio?,"I loved this video! It has 3 episodes:22) Mirror of Dreams! Amazon's Final Stage23) Amazoness! The Nightmare From Behind the Mirror24) The Power Explodes! Amy's (Ami's) Song of the HeartOk, here's the deal. In epis. 22 Fish Eye discovers Serena's true identity!!! Will she trade Serena's dreams for the Amazon's humanity??? Epis. 23 Is when the Amazon Quartet shows up. They cause problems at the arcade, and leave chanting ""Don't dream that your all grown up! Big dreams are best just for kids!!!"" over, & over, & over . . . Epis. 24 is one of my favorites. It starts with Ami, and some sappy music. The music cause a lot of emotions for her good & bad. What will she do???This is a grate video, & its well worth its price! If you interested, check it out!"
3,Does the job but pretty flimsy,"Although from the picture this looks pretty solid...it is not. The legs want to buckle underneath so you have to be very careful where you place this. To add you saw..well that does not fit like it should either and you have to ""rig"" it up to hold it solid.For quick temporary jobs I guess you could say this is ok, but then again just use a counter top and save yourself the money.It is built with cheap ""metal"" and will not withstand heavy use."
3,Tracklisting,1. Who's Ya Daddy?2. DeepFryer (Ole!)3. Computerlife4. Community Control5. Elector 4004
5,great,"Keeps steering wheel warm in summer and cool in the summer. Quality item, good price, quick shipper, thanks recommended thanks"
1,Bridge 8.0 is obsolete,"Bridge 8 has some marvelous features -- if you can access them. This 20-year-old software plays on older Macintosh computers, but is not compatible with the current system 10. Sounds were not accessible, and I had to try the software out on an older computer to make it work at all. An update would be welcome, but Macintosh users should be warned."
1,Awful Bridge Product,"This product should not be on the market. It is totally out-of-date. The pace of play gives ""slow"" a whole new dimension. I would only hope that I can get a refund."
5,Crystal Clear Blue Eyed Soul,"I'm a long time fan of anything Bryan Duncan, and this is even better with the band. This Christmas is my favorite track. A wonderful addition to your Christmas music."
1,Dreadful dreadful book,"I can't think of a single good thing to say about it. It reads like an entry to those one of the Worst Writing contests--it is so bad, it's like a parody of pointlessly melodrama. Mrs. De Winter spent nearly the entire book inside her own head, sharing her thoughts, fears, and aimless existence and it sounded just like this: ""I think I knew at once, in an instant, things would never be the same again, they couldn't be the same, not now, not ever, I was a fool to think otherwise, oh WHY didn't I see, why COULDN'T I see, that things were different but forever the same, always the same, they couldn't be otherwise, I know that now, I think I knew that then, but until that instant I didn't believe, didn't want to believe, that for me, things were just as before, exactly as before, forever haunting us, forever coming between us, just as before, unchanged........."" Bleah."
1,Atrocious!,"Don't waste your time, what a big flop! Nothing like ""Rebecca""! Daphne DuMaurier would roll in her grave right about now! Awful!"
1,A very good example of why fanfic should never be published.,"This novel should have remained in the author's mind until she got on medication. For anyone who had read Rebecca, this book will not only insult you but ignore the the original. From the strong woman we know the heroine to have become, this book returns her to a state of jellyspined idiocy. The plot is insipid and the characters a cheap knock off of the original. Mrs Danvers returns to coincidentally live just down the road from our intrepid heroine. There she has a job as a housekeeper but has set up her bedroom with Rebecca's things. We then get a bad sendup of the original bedroom scene where she futher attempts to frighten our heroine. Maxim is turned into a boorish jerk who needs a slap.Painful - this book causes deep hurting. Avoid it and save money."
1,Mrs de Winter,This book lacks the suspense and intrigue of the original. The entire first two thirds could have been condensed into 2 chapters. The characters have lost their original strength and become insipid. My high hopes were not met by this book.
3,Funny,"I thought this book was quite funny, and it did made me think how things in your past can change your whole future.However, I felt the ending was a bit rushed, and I also think the book was created for a British public, so unless you lived in Britain through the 80's, you will have no idea when she makes references to Pop Stars, and trends that only took place there.Still, it is a funny and different book, and it did make me go back to when I was 16!"
3,Hard to describe - but good,"Hawaiian, mystical, historical... it is as much about Hawaii's land and lore as it is about the characters in the story. Strong female characters."
3,Tries too hard,"Unfortunately, this book was written in passive voice much of the time. The story line is interesting but the characters lack validity. A mother who doesn't love her children and other flimsy characters live lives of psuedo-Hawaiian activism. This author clearly strives to write in the style of magical mysticism we loved from latin America (Like Water for Chocolate or Love in the Time of Cholera) yet can't quite get it right. The Hawaaiian language glossary in the back of the book is of extremely poor quality and the author continues to annoy the reader by using Hawaiian and Japanese words not in the glossary."
4,chillout 06 / the ultimate chillout,"As good as all the others from this collection.The only thing I didn't like was the sarah mclachlan song world on fire ,they included this same song ( different remix ) on chillout 05 they shoud not have included it again .But other than that I loved most of the songs : delirium you and I , ulrich schnauss on my own , talk talk life's what you make it , ian brown time is my everything , san ilya bellissimo , bent silent life .And I thought The Postal Service cover of against all odds was brilliant.Just Great !!!!!!!!! A MUST ."
3,Good study,"The Chopper Boys is a unique book, looking at the subject of helicopters used in various wars in Africa in the second half of the 20th Century. The employment of helos by the French in Algeria (in itself a pioneering effort), the Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique, the South Africans and the Rhodesians are all studied. Lavishly illustrated with photos Chopper Boys discusses various airframes, weapons and tactics developed in the African Wars. The only real drawback I find with this book is the organization, which sometimes makes the book read like a bunch of magazine articles strung together. There is no chronological order to the material. However, there's no denying that this is a fascinating book and one of the few available on this subject."
2,Right Item Rusty Condition,Item came in original package but was brake bar was rusted. Out of the two pieces I used one and junked the other as it was so badly rusted.
3,Another item needlessly bright,"This gadget has a simple job - convert a 12V cigarette lighter socket to a USB charging port. It works great but it is yet another item that has a needlessly bright blue LED installed. I'm not sure why manufacturers feel compelled to stick bright blue LED's in electronic gadgets but it just isn't necessary. This USB charger will do the job but if you don't want a bright blue light poking you in the eye at night in your car, look for something else."
5,fits my winch perfect,"Fits perfect....works off the back of my pickup bed floor. lets me pull heavy, awkward stuff up on the bed via ramps. great product, great service from amazon"
2,Mehhh,"Although Eyewitness Travel Guides may offer more visual guidance than other guide books, they are still quite terrible. Maps are difficult to read and information is inconsistent."
3,"Nice, but much too heavy","If you like your travel guides slick and glossy and full of color photos, this is your eye candy. But it weighs a pound and a half. Another disadvantage is that most of the photos are quite small, and the type is also very small. It's a fairly nice book, but it's definitely not a practical field guide. So, look at it before you leave, and then leave it at home. As for guides about B&Bs, I'd pass on Bed & Breakfast Ireland by Dillard and Causin if I were you. There are very few B&Bs listed in it, and someone forgot to proofread it. Plus, it's a title ripoff of the REAL Irish B&B guide, called Bed & Breakfast Ireland 2003 (perhaps there is a newer version) put out by Town & Country Homes. (...)"
3,ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT!,"I must say that the only reason, I got the CD is cause Miss Kittin had some tracks as a guest star and of course ""ripping kittin"" which I think is just amazing. I did feel that her lyrics and vocals were a bit forced not to sound like the usual Miss Kittin (dark, dirty, playfull, sexy) but, then... it is not her album but the album of Goldenboy. I think that for those who want and intro on electro and are to afraid to go deep...this is the CD to have. For the rest of us who are beyond that stage, this might be to light."
4,Not compatible with my new computer,I wasn't aware that this game wouldn't work with my computer. I tried it on an older computer and was able to install it though. It's a fun game for kids even if the graphics are old-school. I used to love playing this game when I was younger. Be sure to check what kind of system it works with before buying.
1,Expired,I ordered several spices from this company and many were already expired when they arrived. I would not recommend.
5,Pedro and Quixote love it,"I purchased 2 of these and the bettas, Pedro and Quixote, seem to be thriving in them. Installation was easy, too."
1,Terrible customer support,"Have been trying unsuccesfully for days to download the Windows VISTA compatability update for Paperport 11.0. I keep getting an error message from their website saying ""server error"". Called tech support to report the problem with their website, but they wouldn't even talk to me without charging my credit card. Attempted to email tech support to report the problem, but again they wanted to charge my credit card. This is totally unacceptable. I have owned the past 5 versions of Paperport, but never again."
1,a let down upgrade,"I found this program more difficult to load and more cumbersome to use than previous editions. It was so restrictive and time consuming I sent it back and decided to reinstall the older edition I had purchased years ago. As seems to be more common, the upgraded editions are more difficult to use and in reality do nothing more than the older editions."
1,Paperport 11 Stinks,I've used Paperport 6 then Paperport 9 for about 8 years. When I got a free Paperport 11 with a printer and installed it expecting an upgrade. It is a severely crippled version of Paperport 12 and I was not able to most of the things I could do with Paperport 9. After experiencing this I would never buy software from Nuance again. I feel really sorry for people who actually paid $200 for it. Do NOT install this software if you are using an earlier version. This is definitely a downgrade from any of the earlier versions you may have.
2,Crippled Product - Beware of the copy protection watermark,"I have used Paperport for many years and generally like the software for document management,However, potential purchasers of Paperport 11 or 12 need to know that there is a copy protection Docucom Watermark that may intermittently show up on your pdf files made with Paperport - making them unusable.This problem does not affect all users - but it is like a virus - once you have it - you cant get rid of it. At least that is my experience.There is a workaround where you make a TIFF file first and then print it to PDF - but this additional step is annoying and takes additional time.I understand that Nuance is working on a fix - but this problem has existed for several years now.When this problem is fixed I would give the product 4 stars - but for now it is crippled.CheersJohn"
2,Not the best buy I have ever made,"This coffee pot looks nice and the coffee is great as soon as it finishes making. But the thermal carafe doesn't keep it hot very long, even though I let it stand with hot water in it before I made the coffee. The 2 thermal travel mugs are the same. And they are hard to drink out of without dribbling the coffee down the front of your shirt! Also, the travel mugs do not have anything to cover the hole on the top and it splashes out in your car. I have quit using this pot and gone back to my old one."
4,Thought-Provoking Read,"Kudos to Ms. Lankford for a very good story. It had action, suspense, intrigue, and more. But that's not why I'm writing the review. While I finished the novel weeks ago, I still find my mind wandering back to the premise of the story and wondering ""what if."" Ms. Lankford made me stop and think about my understanding of faith, politics, the value of life, the implications of cloning and more. If you are interested in a wild ride of a story and maybe a wild ride re-examining the truths you hold dear, then this is the book for you."
1,Catholics Will Be Disappointed in this Book,"On top of really bad science, this book is full of really bad Catholicism. The first tip off is the casual, off-the-wall mention of the Jesus Seminar, as if they were the new authority in the Church.I did not find Maggie at all believable. I didn't find anything in this book believable. Save your money!"
5,This is Bling!,"I love love this watch! It is big, heavy, and brings just the right bling anywhere you go! I originally was shopping for he Toy watch, then reading the reviews of the fossil one when this one popped up on the side bar of Macy's. They quickly sold out of it within a week of me going to purchase it. ;-/ So I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.com for much less than the dept store. :)It's a must have and I wear it all the time with everything! :) :) :)"
4,Great Learning Tool,"My five year old had played JumpStart games in the past so we got this for him for Christmas. It really makes learning contagious as it's so much fun he doesn't even realize he's learning new things as he goes.One small warning, however. This game only provides the first couple modules of content. After that JumpStart hits you up for a subscription or a lump sum payment for the additional content. Once your child starts playing the game it's pretty hard to stop and not pay for the expansions."
4,HULA SKIRTS,I GUESS THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE PRICE. I AM USING THEM FOR A KIDS PARTY SO THEY WILL BE GREAT!
2,Disapointed.,"Although, the chocolate was good, and the inside was very creamy; it seemed that every chocolate was Hazelnut-flavored. I was very disapointed in the flavors of this chocolate. Especially after reading such glowing reviews, I was upset recieving something that was decent, but just buying a cheap box of chocolates at the store is just as good. You want delicious chocolates, go for Godiva."
5,Chocolate Delight,"The best chocolates my wife and I have ever had. We thought we knew good chacolates having purchased and consumed more well know upper shelf chocolates before, but these blow all of them away. Do yourself a big favor and buy a box of these for yourself!!!! You may find yourself eating them all and not sharing one of them!!!1"
1,Overpriced.,People who spend this kind of money on belgian chocolate will likely never be able to afford a vacation in belgium.
5,Maravillosa!!!,"Una novela más como pocas que han tocado mi corazón y que me ha hecho llorar. Es así como el amor debe perdurar hasta el final, en las buenas y en las malas."
3,hmmmm......,"after hearing ""The Negation"" and then going back to this, I realized that the first shows Decapitated in their true form. While this isnt a bad album, it leaves me somewhat unsatisfied. First off, all I can think is ""weak."" thats how everything sounds. They're trying to make it in-your-face death metal, but just can't pull it off. It just doesn't deliver. On the other hand, the musicianship is excellent, as is the production. While sound quality and musicianship are two very important things, those are the only things that make this album somewhat decent. Get ""The Negation,"" for it is a truly great masterpiece of death metal."
1,Too small for Graco's Pack n Play,"We just got a Graco pack n play and this cover is too small for the changing table. It also doesn't stay put so the pad (or cover) keeps moving around. I returned this one and got a refund. I'm a nurse and decided to try a reusable/washable incontinence bed/chair liner (small size) and it works so much better. Not only is the pad quilted and softer but the back is non slip. Oh and the pad only cost [...], same as this one, only it's thicker and better."
3,"Not her Dad, but then, why should she be?","I bought this album out of curiosity, as I am a big fan of Greg Brown. I was delighted at the difference between her musical style and her father's, but hoping she had caught a bit more of his lyrical talent.Pieta has not lived long enough to write with the depth and vigor that her dad brings to his lyrics, and it isn't fair to expect her to--without the decades of life experience, she still brings a lot to the table.What struck me most was the depths of her bluesy voice, husky and delicious. Bo Ramsey's guitar work is quintessential Bo Ramsey, spare and haunting, and it captures the melancholy and the magic in Pieta's voice very well.Overall this is an album worth a listen on it's own merit, as Pieta is on a strong start to a career that will hopefully be as long and and varied as her father's."
4,Right from the Heart-Land,"I am truely thankful to hear an artist who has obvious reverence for the life she was given. Her lyrics gracefuly express an awareness of lifes simple pleasures. One listen to Blind Dog Yell, track two of the album and I was taken by the simple poetic verse and how difficult that is for most artists to capture. Unless of course they too express from their soul! Way to go Pieta. By the way, she has another album I Never Told, that is as much or better of a delight. Buy it, listen to the lyrics from under a shade tree and smile."
5,I agree with TOWNSENDs asessment.............,"I found it to me more in the quasi idioms of Britten...was nice to hear original melodic lines interwoven in a manner which kept your interest and your attention focused.I'm not sure what the other reviewer actually saw/heard, but it wasn't this performance. Of course I'm also interested in the premiere of HIS masterpiece."
2,Peanuts and Jimbo; an uneasy marriage.,"I loved the idea of reproducing much of the art from the original work, with editor's notes, erasures, pencil lines all showing. However, the mixture of the work of hugely popular mass-market artists like Schultz and (in the underground, Crumb) with more recent avante-guarde artists like Panter seemed odd to me. Peanuts was a cultural phenomenon, but has anyone actually ever read ""Jimbo"". I didn't, even when I bought ""Raw"" years ago. I appreciate boomer artists raised on the pulps would want to do something more ""high-brow"", but for me, the very nature of the medium mitigates against the sophisticated existentialism of, say, Chris Ware. Sure, I guess that has it's place, but what makes comics great is how the artists develop ways of making it easier for anyone to read and understand, not harder."
2,the good the bad the ugly,"if you just need something to spray and pray with hit add to cart now!!! it will save your wallet bc for this price its a good buy. but for those of you that like to keep you barrel clean and shoot in inches don't waste your time. you will get at less 5out100 balls chopped or busts in the marker (side note I got 5out1000 or better with my ""T68"" from ""rap4"" but its made not to eat balls!! AKA use a good marker to do better) and last but not lest for all to know and why I only gave 2* is you have to clean your balls when you get them I think it tock me 3hrs to clean 4000!! this comes from balls braking in the bags as you know they come cut in to 500 a bag +/- some had 10 broken and some had 1 hell I think I had 1 bag that didn't have any. anyways just clean them (AKA wipe off the paint on the out side of them with a paper towel) and you'll be good to go!!!"
1,naggggg,"price good, shiping ok (none brocken).everything seem greate abouth this deal untill game time, the paintballs got air lifted away and there was no air blowing that day!!. they didn't breake at impact, when at least one or two made it to the target. the ones that worked abit had harly any paint. i recomebd the seller to stop selling this type of paintballs and give a good deal to shopers whom have bougth this particular product, i like the pink floresent paint fill balls."
2,"They're greasy, fragile, and misshapen. But I guess they're cheap.","So this is my first box of paintballs. But compared to my friends, they pretty much suck. They're not at all dry, some have dents in them, and about 1/20 balls will split. I guess they're cheap, but it would be difficult to convince me to buy these again. I'm not even really sure there were 2000 paintballs in the box. Perhaps I could be coerced into buying more."
2,Misshapen,"Seconds Premium Paintballs - 2000 RoundsMinimal breakage when delivered but that can be due to the fact that the paintballs seem rock solid and after a glance of the paintballs, I could tell that they were misshapen. As another reviewer said, they look like they were taken out of the trash container from wal-mart."
1,He must have found those paintballs in Walmart's trash container.,"I cannot use any of those painballs. They are all damaged. They have all sorts of forms but round isn't any of them. I guess will will accept my loss and just throw them away. The seller ActionVillage also never responds to any email requests. Also, those balls are the same that they sell at Walmart. Walmart paintballs are the worst one can buy. Splash or Gab paintballs seem to be the best calls one can buy at a reasonable price."
3,"Disappointing set, but decent flicks","I have not heard of these films prior to seeing this set, but was definitely more intrigued when I saw the Walken on the cover. The angel-themed action flicks have quite a cool concept that made me think of the more recent Legion, which unlike many people I found to be very entertaining. This Blu-ray set comes with only two discs for the 5 films, 4 of which are packed onto one disc. The cons: fairly poor audio and no subtitles. The pros: a nice package of all the films at a low price.Source: criticnic.com 17 November 2012Disclosure: Film sent by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment"
3,"A $4.99 ""Phantom"" bargain buffet...","Thats' how I see this set of ""highlights"". We go to most $4.99buffets, we enjoy them but the food is just OK, nothing really exceptional.This is a studio production that is competent enough but seems to lack flair and enthusiasm. This MASTERS disc has no production information except the listing of the four major singers and the 11 tracks. It could have been made by any small city symphony and ensemble. The balance between orchestra and singers is not allways ideal. There also seems to be a greater use of synthesizers than I remember in original cast recordings, most evident in the overture. I could be wrong! This is no way a substitute for the original cast recordings and I'm sure some of those have flaws too. It is hard to botch up Webber's glorious score so at a bargain price this will do. All your favorite highlights are here. I just want a little more inspiration, thats all."
2,The 3. studio cast CD,"I noticed that the other reviewer gave this recording five stars and claimed that it was much, much better than the original ""Phantom of the Opera"". I am sorry to say I strongly disagree. First of all, the sound quality of this recording is rather poor, at least compared to other ""Phantom"" recordings I have. And the singers are technically much weaker that what I'm used to hear, though I must admit that they are not bad. Kira Bronte is the best on this recording, but Michael Heath is also nice to listen to. I found the ""Masquerade"" number dull, with a little lack of enthusiasm - and that's no good in this number! ""Music of the Night"" was decent, but not anything new.... The best number is actually ""Point of no return"". My advice: Ae you a ""phan""? Byu this, no doubt. Want to buy your first or second ""Phantom"" CD? Well, settle for the Original Cast or Canadian Cast before this one. Those are exceptional high standard. This CD is just O.K."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This holder looked like the perfect holder for my V3 Razr, however looks are deceiving, when it arrived at my home, I put the holder gently onto the base and the base broke in my hand. Being optimistic, I stuck the base onto the dash of my truck with extra strength 3M foam adheisive. Next day I put the phone in the holder and and the phone fell to the floor, the locking mechinism would not hold. What a piece of [...]! Do not buy this unless it is a gift for someone you do not like."
1,Waste of money,This video is a waste of time. There is no music and no real footage. I could have provided better commentary!
1,Why did I buy this?,"I bought it because the description I read made it sound interesting, which it certainly is not. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers as a matter of fact. The only thing not disappointing about this DVD is that it is actually 20 minutes shorter than the noted 61 minutes, which means there is less time wasted fastforwarding through the thing trying to find something worth watching in it."
3,eh..ummm. yeah,"you gotta love ben gibbard but the quality of the recordings are really grainy, some songs i cant even listen to but there are a couple that are pretty stellar, if you love Death cab, and you already have all the death cab albums and you already got the postal service album than you might as well go ahead and get this one to finish off ur collection, thats the way to go, if ya love death cab then you like this"
4,Great Harmonies here.,"80's harmonies with a bit of progressive metal itch, this band shows that technical proficiency of the players must not outshine the songwriting sensibilities of the band as a whole. Nations push the line with wholly indulgent vocal and instrumental buildup but vindicate themselves through a liberated guitar lead jamming. Most clearly called to mind would be Europe and Bonfire."
2,Multiple broken jars,The product itself was delicious but a couple of jars had lost their seal and leaked so I was afraid to use and tossed the whole case! Very disappointing.
2,Junk,"If this toy had not been a gift I would have returned it right away. My 2-1/2 year olds were given two Bob the Builder toys and both were in pieces before an hour was up. They are poorly built and I wouldn't waste the money on them now that I know how crummy they are. The crane broke off very quickly. Also, I'd seen children with them at the parks and apparently the ""talking"" part is not durable either. A little sand and it won't talk any more. I plan to ship Scoop and Lofty back to the manufacturer with my comments."
2,One Disc Won't Play,"Love it except that one disc won't play in any of my players or PCs. If could get refunded or replaced, would give 5 stars."
4,Clunky but works,"A little clunky, but it works -- even on a Mac. That's all you really need to know. Just make sure all your connections are fitting securely (that's where I had some initial trouble) and you'll be home free. Good price on this item, too."
2,Both Fluffy & Entertaining...,"This is a guru book, mostly filled with 'emotional wisdom'. There isn't much solid info to be had, just entertaining stories and anecdotes. To paraphrase what I found useful: ""You can read and study business til the end of time, but you just have to jump in and do it!"" Consider this book an emotional primer, nothing more, nothing less."
3,Check this out straight from the pages of his books,"""So how did this change? I hadbeen promoted almost every year at IBM and had won many awards.IBM taught me about computers and how to sell. I liked the people Iworked with and the ethical culture the company promoted.""That's what the writer says about IBM..Alright? ""Ethical culture"" he says..ok now let's check IBM's as described in Wikipedia.""During the rise of Nazi Germany and the onset of World War II, IBM had relationships and contracts with the German military/industrial technocracy. IBM's punch card machines were used by Germany to keep track of people who were to be subjected to the Holocaust""..Ethical culture,my @$$!!!!!!"
4,Motivating,"I was on vacation in San Diego last week when I stumbled upon this book at the Upstart Crow bookstore. Well I got some tea and sat down to just skim it before continuing my sightseeing. Well I sat there for four hours - 4 hours! And on my last day! The book is a wonderful read and her thoughts, insight are captivating and thought-provoking.A very good read for those new to Buddhism or that are spiritually inclined - or anyone who wants to improve themselves and their outlook on life. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. By the way, I bought the book :)Amitabha~"
2,"Kind of green, but a good read","Hurriedly churned out. Pop. Superficial. Still, fun in a sophomoric way. There are many ways one might find enlightenment, even by stubbing your toe. But, stubbing your toe is cheaper, and leaves a longer lasting impression. Beautiful cover art, though. Too bad it doesn't relate to the content."
4,Hot New Nugget?,"Incredible journey with ups and downs. This band melds southern influence with funk, and enough groove to make you want more. The bassist really digs in and the lyrics are provoking. Album is really balanced by the jams - they just keep pulling you in. This is a double cd that I could not get enough of."
1,The Same Nobody's for Twenty Years.,"It's amazing how if only a few people keep telling themselves they are special for a long enough time, they may eventually get someone outside of themselves to believe it. I feel sorry for the poor soul who greenlighted this book and was assuredly fired soon after. These guys have some how managed to write about the same group of nobodys for twenty years and call themselves cutting edge. The makers of this magazine must thank their lucky stars for their parents giving them a trust fund to ride all the way to the retirement home. How old are the founders of this magazine now anyway? They must be very close to entering that big drag show in the sky. Save your money and go buy a book from a true cutting edge magazine like Vice, Tokion,Vibe or Interview. You will be happier."
4,a good guide,there is not too much more information in this book than in the full India version. The information is not sustaisially more recent either.There is a little bit more in there and the book generally has it all together though. Worked well for me.
4,so far i am pleased,i am on my way to India so i hope this book will be thorough but i use lonely planet books all the time to travel and i travel alot.
1,Wake Me Up When It's Over.,"A book that just doesn't work.I just really got bored with this book. I read about two thirds and now I feel like I'd rather watch reruns of that show Tales From The Crypt than finish. That show is what this book is trying to be. Sort of half scary, half funny. I liked that show but this book isn't funny or scary. It's really corny. I won't give away the ending [i skipped to the end and read it] but it's pretty silly.I guess all in all I thought this book could have been good if it wasn't so silly. it could have been good if it wasn't about dead people. that whole thing was kind of dumb. so I guess you should buy some other book."
1,Just Don't Work,I am struck by how many of the positive reviews for this book were written by people from the author's hometown. I wish I'd noticed this before forking over my dough because this bird don't fly. It's a real turkey. Less a book and more a spec script for an unproduced X-Files episode. Take a pass.
1,The kind of book that makes me want to read no more,"English is not my first language so I was not sure if I was really understanding the book. I thought ""this book is no good,"" but was that me or the book. I didn't know. I showed the book to my English teacher. He told me ""this book very silly book."" So I was right. This book is very bad. I would say if you have to buy a book do not buy this book. It isn't good. I was told this was scary book but it isn't scary. it's just not very good at all. I am sure the writer will be making better book next time though."
2,NO Frank Sinatra,"I got this album because Amazon has it listed as having early Frank Sinatra on it. They are wrong. If you want Frank Sinatra do NOT buy this album.This is a nice collection of popular tunes from 1935. Some are pure instrumental, some with a female vocalist, some with a male."
2,A Major Disappointment,"While there are moments when this movie shines, it's really a terrible waste of time and celluloid. The actress cast as Chanel is quite lovely, and she sometimes actually resembles the great fashion designer, and she's given good support from Timothy Dalton and Rutger Hauer. Karen Black gives another one of her silliest performances as Hauer's mistress who convinces Chanel to open a hat shop in Paris.Still, there are many facts that are ignored and it's not as lavish and lovely as it should be. If anyone deserves the A & E Biography to set the record straight it is Coco Chanel. This is a good way to waste an afternoon on mindless biographies. Pair it with another turkey like Julie Andrews as Gertrude Lawrence in STAR or Diana Ross as Billie Holiday in LADY SINGS THE BLUES and you'll have lots of useless fictional information about great women of this century."
1,Not the original artists,"Thought I scored. All these great songs on one CD! However, it is not the original artists singing these songs. What a let down. I wish I read the review before purchasing. I hope you do. But at least it wasn't too pricey."
3,Grade: An Incomplete,"The idea of a world government is not new, and it is not a novel thought that humans to achieve the species' highest potential must become unified. The trick is how to unify humanity. Here, Monbiot fails to provide a realistic, understandable method for doing so, and thus deserves an incomplete grade. The missing ingredient, of course, is applying the same federalistic principles used to unify the 13 American states."
4,Starhunter,"Science fiction and a little hokey, but just right for a person who enjoys a little adventure. There is always time for a spaceship adventure."
1,Don't Bother,I now know why it only lasted 1 season.You can see better material and acting in a high school drama club.This mess was a total waste of Michael Pare and his acting ability.
3,Never saw it before,"But, I got it on the reviews and what I had read elsewhere. Turns out to be pretty good for a series. Some effort was put in to the visuals. The stories are a bit simplistic and the teen niece is almost too much to bear, but definitely worth the price and enjoyable on a Saturday afternoon."
3,Not done,I'm not done with it yet! But its good so far but so you'll quit bugging me about a review I'll write this
1,Audio Awful,"I regret that I did not read a previous review that mentioned how awful the audio version is. The Author should not have been the Narrator. It was difficult enough listening to her normal Brooklyn accent but her mimicking other voices was painful. Her Southern Belle accent sounded like a Neanderthal (truly). As far as the story goes, her amateur detective has the pool-cleaning man from the house where a murder was committed come and give her an estimate on having a pool installed so that she can question him (I am not aware that pool cleaners also handle pool sales.) She also gets too involved in details (like the description of a lamp shade). Her attempt at humor is having a crime figure named ""Fancy Phil"" - gee, wonder how she came up with that. I could not finish the first disc and have decided to order satellite radio for my car to prevent future mistakes like this one."
2,Reege,Ok...this book wasn't that terrible..but Reege seems self-centered and cocky....and the book wasn't that interesting. It was just Regis ranting and raving. But it kept me amused for a little bit....so I guess it was alright
3,King Biscuit Again,"This is another re-issue of the King Biscuit Flower Hour album of the 1989 concert in Philadelphia with all the same tracks in the same order, but a bit cheaper."
3,Kansas Kares!,Add this to my infinite collection of compilation and repeated releases. What the heck....I've got money to burn. I hear they are going to re-release all their CDs in corn husks. Guess I'll have to shell out more money for those.
1,Not durable,"Although cute, this watch broke within a week of being purchased. The band snapped in half and is now not usable. Poor value."
4,rain with music,"I purchased this CD looking for backround to lull me into sleep. It has Celtic music which is relaxing but so far it is too good to make me sleep. I want to listen to the music.It is nice, well recorded, but not boring enough to make it a sleep inducer."
2,Campy,"I am a big fan of cast iron and traditional waffles (not a fan of Belgian-sized irons). This looked to be the perfect match.Not so much.The iron is really too small to work on a stove top. The handles get amazingly hot and there is really no nice way to move it around. Also, any over-drip from the batter ends up dropping into the stove.I think this started as a ""Camp Iron"" but is being marketed as a kitchen tool. They need a serious redesign to make this useful for at-home waffles.We have found another use for it, though: it is a great weight for brick chicken in our other cast-iron pans."
2,Waffling on the waffle iron,"Maybe I was spoiled with the quality of the cast iron product purchased from the manufacturer out of Pittsburg Tennesse.Okay I will say it for those that don't know it already. Lodge Cast Iron products do cost more but they more than offset that with immediate satisfaction and a lifetime of service.I did use the unit to cook waffles, the instructions included were nice; however incomplete. I have learned to produce good waffles with the unit however it is not user friendly due to the inferior quality of the contruction and how it comes together. Better suited for making waffle sandwiches than REAL waffles for eating.This one just appears to have very low quality control. Edges are rough, faces don't meet evenly. Overall poor craftsmanship. I would not recoomend the Rome's products for any future purchases. In this case when it is cheaper it does translare into cheap quality.If return shipping were free I would send it back for a refund."
2,Hard to use,"This small waffle iron is hard to use...tried a number of times and haven't gotten crispy waffles (it gets really hot and takes awhile and they still come out spongy--might as well just make pancakes and save time and trouble). Didn't want an electric maker esp with questionable non-stick finish, but may have to concede if I want to make waffles."
2,Very tiny and not deep enough,"I love cast iron cooking, but this iron waffle maker was disappointing because it is really too shallow and small to make a decent waffle."
5,Works Great!,"Used this for the first time this morning. Made PERFECT waffles. Seasoned first per manufacturers directions on my gas grill. Went smoothly. Made waffles this morning with Kodiak Cakes mix and Krusteaz and both mixes worked perfectly. Light and fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside. No sticking! I sprayed with Pam first. Works great! My husband wants to ditch the electric waffle iron."
4,Works great on electric stove,"I received this waffle iron as a Christmas present and I love it.The good,-Well made, both pieces fit together nicely-Waffles fall right out after it's properly seasoned-Works fine on my electric stove top-Waffles are deliciousThe bad,-Handles do get very hot but that's to be expected-Does not come pre-seasoned but it's really not hard to do-It is made in China-Too many waffles makes your stomach hurt"
4,I Never Have To Worry...,"This is a safeguard, just as a backup. I purchased one about 4 years ago so I have one in constant use and one in the case ready for an emergency or for a friend or coworker. They come with one three wire and one with two wire plugs. I would suggest purchasing two sets, that way you can have two for each plug type. Very handy to have around. ABM."
2,Rated for 2.5A max,The surge protecters are not very tight. The easily slip off.Also they are only rated for 2.5 amps.
4,Small but sweet,"These mini surge protectors are great. I have been using them for a while now and they are much better than the large one I use to take with me everywhere. I connected one to my notebook and the other to my netbook and forgot they were there. They are the perfect size and weight. Now I can't speak on how well they protect my computer because I have not had a power surge, thank goodness; but, if you are looking for something light weight that appears to do the job, these are for you."
4,They'll be your favorites too.,"This is a great and very memorable hits collection of her solo work while still very much part of the successful duo Sonny and Cher.Included are her sixties standards that we all and love of hers like ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" and ""You Better Sit Down Kids"". The original ""Alfie"" is a special treat. Also the covers like ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"", ""You Don't Have To Say You Love Me"" and ""All I Really Want To Do"" are almost better than the originals due to her young and aspiring vocals in these productions.The only problem lies in the fact that the tracks are a bit old and not of the best quality. Not the most complex productions either but very pleasant showcase for Cher's voice.Hopefully this review will be read by someone that will pick up this CD and enjoy her ealry masterpieces. I'm honored to be the first to write a review of this album and hope I can help it sales even a small bit."
5,"must be part of your ""piano players"" collection","I have all of his albums. Yes, he was troubled and yes, he had a substance abuse problem, but God could he play. And really, that's all that matters. He's right up there with Tatum and Waller.... I personally believe he may have been somewhere on the autistic scale. As one of the reviewers commented, it's hard to believe only two hands are playing the piano...."
1,does not fit vehicle,"computer generated a wrong item for the fairly brand new Vehicle. I followed the step by step parts order and it came as a wrong Item for a Toyota Camry 2012 XLE. I filed a request for return a week ago but Amazon has not respond to me yet.I would strongly recommend not to ordered this through Amazon. Go to the Dealer or local auto parts for better sure fit.""This product fits your 2012 Toyota CamryTrim: XLEBody Style: 4 Door SedanFitment Notes: Element Chrome Window Visor; 4 pc.;"""
5,"Incredible, full of sensibility.","It's a Wonderful recording. It's one of my favourites, a Cd to remember all your life.The ballad Mood Indigo is magnificient, with Hodges, Terry, Gonsalves, Tyre Gleen on Vibes, and Quentin Jackson on trombone.One of the best ballads i have ever listen.Wonderful arrangements for four horns."
3,Revlon RV970 Lighted Magnifying Mirror,"The magnification is fine, but the light is too weak. I still need the light in the room on."
1,REVLON RV970 MIRROR,I was very disappointed with the overall size of the mirror. It was too difficult to see to use it. I stuckthe mirror back into the box and tossed it in the corner of my closet. Just looking for someone to give it to.
3,Chef's Originals Portobello Risotto,Mediocre risotto which didn't microwave well. Contains whey. It was worth a try.
1,Waste of money.,"There is no way to know whether this ""snake"" would keep the birds out of my figs, or not. The air ""closure system"" is totally useless. It would not seal the air into the 'snake' long enough for me to get it outdoors, much less get it positioned, either in or, under the tree.Thanks for nothing....if you expect to sell these things, you had better come up with a better air sealer!Disgusted customer"
3,"Outdated information, usually obtained for free from your hematologist","I got this book for free from my hematologist after being diagnosed with Hughes Syndrome, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. It is somewhat informative, but quite outdated. Hughes Syndrome was discovered in 1983, so it's a relatively new disease. This book was written in 2001, so there has been more research since it was published. This complicated syndrome can't be described in such a short book (not much more than a pamphlet) and the book fails to mention the many other physical symptoms patients may suffer from (muscle soreness & extreme fatigue to name just a few).I would recommend Sticky Blood Explained by Kay Thackray and More Sticky Blood by Kay Thackray instead of this book."
2,Religions of the World,"The book I ordered is missing almost the entire chapter on Buddhism. All of the pictures are cut out and therefore most of the text is cut out. There's almost an entire page missing, the only thing that's left is a two inch segment that's part of a chart they [the previous owner] didn't destroy. I paid $11.97 and the condition was listed as Used- Good. If I had known an entire chapter had been missing, I would have looked for another copy."
5,Life Saver,"Absolute necessity for travel in Europe. Kept our laptop, camera batteries and cell phone charged. You may need to buy a plug-in adapter for some hotel outlets with the newer style outlets, HOWEVER, don't let that worry you. The hotels have them for sale!"
3,"The Glory years of the st. Louis Cardinals, Volume 1: The R.","The Glory years of the st. Louis Cardinals,Volume 1"
4,Recovery,"I am enjoying reading this meditation book. The meditations are short and sweet, but present some awesome truths. It provides me with encouragement, as well as things to think about."
3,Sucked in Again,"Somehow when these come up in Lightning Deals, I get sucked in by descriptions like ""An authentic French padded leather band"", and a free $80 duffel bag that's worth about $5.A cheap watch with a cheap band. Set the day and date if you can even see them. Not impressed at all.Another purchase that will end up in my ""re-gift"" drawer.Not really satisfied with this purchase. Only a fool would pay the 'regular' price for this watch."
5,THIS IS THE BEST!,If you liked digimon world you'll love this!It seems like the real thing.Even my dad likes it. I love to trian and battle monsters.I LOVE THIS GAME!
2,Short on Content,"This article is one page! One page for $6.00. And, the information was not terribly specific either (how could it be, one page!) There should be (or maybe there was and I missed it) a little disclaimer that what I was buying was one page."
5,Sega Saturns rule,I had tried to by this cord for my old Sega Saturn at the local Gaming stores. They wanted 5 times what I got this for. Recieved in under a week and my kids are loving the Sega Saturn. Kids from all over the neighborhood are coming over to play the game. These are kids with $500 machines in their homes. LOL They say the old games are better and the colors look better. I couldn't have done it with a missing cord. My son thanks me daily.
3,Text too small,This devotional is excellent as far as content goes but the print is TINY making it a bit difficult to read.
4,Excellent!,This book exceeded my expectations and most certainly a good choice for Christians who are looking for a daily read that will boost your day!
5,Experiencing God: Day by Day,This is an excellent daily devotional book. Henry Blackeby is an outstanding writer and theologian.
4,Pretty Good,"I do like this devotional. Had done the workbook a couple of times, I just feel that at times it was not inspirational. I do like to go further in my relationship with God so love his work."
5,Experiencing God Day-By-Day,I have used many daily Christian devotionals through the years but this one is the most powerful. It challenges and encourages me each day. I have been told that President Bush reads this devotional daily. If he does --- he can not help but be challenged and blessed by it. Great Christian devotional!
2,Ouch! Once burned,The ceramic half is ok but the metal rollers? Who made them? It is almost impossible to use them without burning your fingers. I've used electric rollers for years and these have got to be the worst.
4,You Get What You Pay For,"Earthway stands for excellence,pricey but well made and a lot of bang for the buck. There is no other device ever invented that will save you any more time and backbreaking labor in your garden than an Earthway garden seeder,period. The optional seed plates only adds to the tools versatility.The only reason I did not give the optional plates 5 stars is that well frankly they are not essential and as noted they are an option.I do recommend them highly tho as they will save your precious seeds and reduce your thinning labor time effectively enough to pay for themselves in one season if you are an avid gardener like myself. In my humble opinion if you are going to make an investment in a lifetime tool of this quality might as well get all the gadgets with all the bells and whistles that go with it.You will not regret it in this case."
5,fantastic fun,"Yes, Irma's timbre & voice have darkened somewhat since the '60's-- but I think thehusky quality is incorporated well. And while yes it's live so sound isn't completely pristine, it's till very good IMO. Most importantly they run through a whole host ofher most famous material and she just does it great! Very entertaining-- superb artist! If you want a more ballad side of the mature Irma, check out too her underated""True Believer"" album"
4,Good deal for the money,"We have used this a few times since buying it a couple of months ago and love it! We had one burner being used for frying while the other was being used for boiling. I was concerned with the reviews about it being unstable, but welding the extension legs on did the trick. Others sell for well over $100, so this was the best deal we found."
4,Wonderfully scary and entertaining! Needs a Sequel!,"I love adventure puzzle games and this did not disappoint! It really is more scary than you would think and all without a lot of the gore that frankly sickens me that you see in many computer games and movies. Reminiscent of the older scary ghost story movies that can create a chill up your spine and many looks over your shoulder. Really engrossing and like many of the other reviewers I found it a lot shorter than I'd like. Please game creators, give us a sequel and make it much longer! I, for one, would be willing to pay the extra money!"
4,"GREAT GAME, Not very LONG though!","This was a GREAT Game!! But this game defenitley wasn't as long as I expected! It had GREAT Graphics and stuff, but it only had a few puzzles! It wasn't that difficult either, so in my eyes is wasn't the best game I have played."
1,Can't run on XP,"I have not been able to get this game to run. I've tried contacting someone for technical support - no response. I've searched the internet and finally found today that apparently the game won't run on Windows XP. So if you've got XP, don't buy this game."
1,Heed the Windows XP warnings!,"I just wanted to STRONGLY second the warnings already posted about Windows XP incompatibility. I love the game, and tried to reinstall it on my new Windows XP machine. But even setting the Amber.exe file to run in ""Windows 95 compatibility mode"" doesn't work. A search through game blogs indicates that the program uses an old Windows 95-only version of ""Macromedia Projector,"" which Windows XP cannot handle. Only one blogger claims to have made Amber work on an XP machine, by doing a very complicated procedure to allow the system to be fully toggled between XP and Win95 operating systems. I can say that the last PC that successfully ran it for me used Windows 98, but I can't also attest to whether it runs on Windows ME systems. Such a waste, for what once was a very spooky, difficult, and enjoyable adventure game!"
1,BEWARE! Does not work on XP!!,Do not buy this game unless you have a computer with a pre-XP operating system cause it simply will not work. I don't think it works with ME either. This was not made clear online and I was sooo bummed when it arrived.
4,Pretty good game...,"This game has nice visuals and a decent storyline. It's not terribly difficult, so there shouldn't be too many times when you're stuck in a rut at any given point. Ignore the reviews by people who are down-grading the quality because they didn't bother to look at the system requirements before purchasing it (Windows2000 is not and never has been ""backward compatible"" with Windows 95...they have totally different source code and work on different architectures. As for XP, yes this game will work on XP, if you run it in compatibility mode for Windows 95 or 98. Compatibility mode isn't a feature of Windows2000, so that's why you won't be able to run it on that platform)."
1,Very limited capabilities,"I already had what appeared to be the same remote that I bought locally (it was the ONLY one they had!), and this one looked like the same one. But once I got it I discovered that the number of brands it has codes for is VERY LIMITED and does not include a lot of major brands!! Even when I tried using the codes from the booklet in my other remote all I can get to work is the TV function. My DVD player, stereo, CD player etc are all less than a year old (my cable box is older though...) and are all major brands, and this remote doesn't have the capability of operating ANY of them. I have spent about 4 hours using the Code Search function to try every code in it on them, and still have control of ONLY my 8 year old television!! While it LOOKS exactly like several others (including one that operates everything) it definitely is NOT as versatile as others!!! My ONLY complaints are about the remote itself, the seller shipped it quickly and did everything required of them."
1,Might have been useful 20 years ago,"I purchased this for an elderly parent with compromised vision, with the hope that somehow it would be able to fully control the Bright House Samsung DVR. The BrightHouse supplied remote is a challenge for the vision impaired. Unfortunately it could not, and as such is pretty much useless. Good idea, but this product needs a refresh to be relevant in the 2010's and beyond."
2,"Sounds dated and contrived to score a ""hit""","That's the impression I get when I listen to this. What I mean by dated is lots of 80's style synth and some really machine-like fake sounding drum tracks. This album comes nowhere near Henry Paul's first. The songs just don't have any depth and sound like a dumbed down formula was used to try to score a radio hit. It's not awful ,but I just don't see myself listening to this much when I can hear classic Outlaws or ""Grey Ghost""."
3,"Marvelous sound, but somewhat detached performance","This reading of the 8th is certainly nothing to scoff at, and Pentatone's SACD recording is very nicely done indeed. Good clarity and vivid sound, the rear surround speakers adding a much welcome presence and sense of space.The performance itself, while having a good sense of line is surprisingly detached and cool in its expression. This dark work veritably seethes with passions both brash and overt and more quietly menacing, with a range of dynamic emotion from resigned hush to climaxes that push the boundary of what can be tolerated... at least that is what the symphony can contain.. but little of this is really felt here.. The slower pacing does little to help this lack of incisiveness and emotional virulence.. it is all rather too 'clean'.To sum... solid playing and direction, but lacking in passion and impact."
5,They Keep Getting Better And Better,"I once read an interview with Okkervil's singer/songwriter Sheff in which he said he didn't want to be famous--well, there isn't going to be much he can do about that after this album. The band's sound is too strong to be ignored. As for Sheff himself, he sounds like the singer Jonathan Richmond could have been, but never quite developed into--and his lyrics read as beautiful on paper as they sing. This is a brilliant group that just keeps getting better and better. If they keep topping themselves with every album the way they've been doing, I think they are going to give me a heart attack."
3,"Okay, but not as good as the others","I have been reading Thoroughbred books for a while now and was really excited about this book. It's about Ashleigh when she lived back at Edgardale (before the virus) and trying to cope with snobby girls at a riding school and her wish for a horse.The first time I read this book, I thought it was pretty good, but not extremely exciting. It's low-key compared to the others, without much of a plot. (the only conflict is resolved early in the book) Though some parts are good, I have to admit most of it is kind of boring. I tried to read it again and couldn't even make it through, it was so boring! If you really want to read it, I'd advise checking it out at the library and reading it once instead of buying. It's not the type of book I'll read over and over, unlike most of the other Thoroughbred books."
3,Good resource,This is a good resource to have on your shelf especially in regards to child development.
3,Gets a little boring,"We own several videos of these series, and my daughters do enjoy them all. This video is great if only because of the repetition of the numbers (they sure learn to recite them) but it does get a little boring past 10. My daughters get distracted at this point, which doesn't happen with the other videos."
1,More remakes---argh,"Give me a break people. A tribute to Donna Summer with really bad remakes. The only track worth anything is the Laura Brannigan redo of Dim All The Lights. If you like that track then buy Laura's album its worth it. Other than that save your money and dont buy this sad CD of bad remakes. Here's an idea...how bout some fresh music. Between Hollywood and the record industry, the continuous reworking of old material is wearing thin."
3,Absolutely NO customer support!,"I am an avid user of PaperPort, have been for years since I received PaperPort 9.0 (or maybe earlier) version with my Brother All-In-One.It is miracle software that is easy to use, easy to find documents, photos, etcetera.You can scan to it from your scanner or scan from it to your scanner, drag and drop stacks of documents, you name it!The only thing you can't do is GET CUSTOMER SUPPORT TO HELP YOU EVEN IF YOU PAY THE MONEY!I recently upgraded from PP 10 and now even though I can see my scanner on the list PP 11 does not believe it is there.Sounds simple and I've spent hours getting the information they requested after three weeks of waiting and then nothing, you cannot communicate with them, their FAQ is ridiculous, and their ""community"" forum format is the worst!Good luck!"
2,"When It's Good, It's Good; When It's Bad, It's Horrid!","I've been a PaperPort User since version 6. I cannot get version 11 to set up properly with my scanner. Other programs scan just fine using the TWAIN interface.Cryptic error messages during repeated install efforts. Whenever the scanner starts, I get an ""ESLang.dll"" error message. I've tried the install on three different computers to see if there was just a configuration issue on my intended computer; same issues.Oh, and if you do get a successful set-up, PaperPort will always be ""checking for updates,"" delaying your start of the program. Then the ""updates"" are add-on products or new versions, not the desparately needed patches for the program itself."
2,Instability issues and no Free support,"This product has some instability issues. Since installing I have been getting a series of weird problems upon turning computer on. Messages about trying to install changes to Word Normal templates every time I start up my system. Upon executing Word get message about configuring Word 2000 for Paperport, do I want to save changes. This happens everytime, even if changes are saved.Paperport and Word 2000 are not all that compatible. The enhanced search engine from Nuance won't install, it is not supported with Word 2000.In addition to this, there is no free support, you must spent $9.95 to just email them a question - I would think they would want to hear about the problems, this clearly beta product is having.I would wait till it it more stable, 6 months down the road maybe before upgrading or buying"
1,"Very unstable, costly tech support","I upgraded from Paperport 9 and I wish I had never made the jump. 9 was virtually trouble free, 11 is a nightmare. It freezes up no less than a dozen times per day. Tech support will tell you that they have had no complaints but I find that hard to believe. The only up side is that there is no other program out there that does all this one will do."
1,Very Disappointing Product - Use the free version instead!,"I have been a loyal customer and bought a full version of PP10, and paid to upgrade to PP11. During the last 18 months, I upgraded my laptop twice, and then upgraded my current laptop from XP to Vista. When I downloaded the Vista version and tried to reinstall it, it says the software cannot be activated. Turns out that they only let you install the darn thing 3 times.THAT IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS IN THIS DAYS AND AGES. To add insult to injury, they want you to pay full price and buy another full version.Guess what. They lost me as a customer, permanently. I uninstalled it and use the FREE Paperport that comes with my Brother All-in-one printer instead. And then, I discovered that there are actually many free Print-to-PDF products that you can download from the web, such as CutePDF, or PrimoPDF.Don't waste time with this product!"
4,Prompt Service,"Price was a bit steep for a cd, however it is no longer in print. CD works great, no complaints."
3,cd,"Thank you for all the comunication snd correcting any errors,although my item was shipped to my previos address it was no fault of yours and your understanding is appreciated."
1,Rouge Ops Review,"This game is probably the worst game I have ever played. The graphics is good but the action was absolutely terrible. When you go to attack an enemy, you press the a button and a screen pops up showing you which way to move your joystick to make her attack. Then the game dose the fighting all by itself. The only time you actualy fight your enemy is when you shoot at them. If you are looking for a good action game I seriousely do not recommend this game."
1,Worth less than a piece of wire.,"I replaced the ""piece of wire"" antenna that came with my radio with this thing. The terk was WORSE, no matter how I aimed it or turned it.Calling this thing worthless is too generous. It had NEGATIVE worth in that it made my reception worse."
1,Terrible,The book was predictable and far fetched.SPOILER******************************************The hero's wife is savagely murdered and a month later he is sleeping with a new woman? The author never really explains this away and the hero comes off as unfeeling. Also the part at the end was just foolishness. The hero is tracking down his wife's murderers(who killed her just bc she was his wife) so he takes along another woman(who has no experience in using a gun or tracking men) that he loves to track the men down!! Also for him to be such a good tracker he got caught unaware a lot. END of SPOILER. **************************Basically this book wasn't worth the time it took to read it. The supporting characters are simple and lack depth. The plot had me rolling my eyes at the impossiblity(even for a romance novel).
3,Interesting...,"Basically the photocopies of Dr Wieger's research, this book is interesting if Chinese characters is a real hobby. Since I am studying Japanese kanji, it is often very interesting to go back to their Chinese origin and this book is somewhat helpful for their etymology. But, it's definitely not an efficient reference book... Cool to own, though, as Wieger's research is rather old (1927)."
1,"bad product, terrible customer service","I bought this burner for beer brewing. when it arrived it had no regulator/ hose assembly. I returned it to Amazon and they immediately sent me a new on with all the parts. On my second batch I noticed the burner was only half on when I was using high fire to boil the kettle. I called the company and they sent me a new regulator that didn't fix the problem. I have been trying for 6 weeks to get them to send a new burner with no luck. I have called 3 times and left messages on their machine and with the receptionist. No one has called back. I emailed them with no response either. So, can't recommend this unless all you want to do is melt butter."
5,Great Burner,I bought this burner for brewing my beer. Excellent height off ground and the legs are sturdy. The burner distributes the heat well.
3,An Interesting Story yet Too Biased for Comfort,"This book was somewhat of a disapointment. This is largely due to it's obviously biased viewpoints. However, what really bothered me was its lack of real information. The story was basically a compilation of dramatic stories all stressing how inhumane or heartless the Russian soldiers were and how ignorant westerners are, which would have been okay had that not been the only thing Politkovskaya said throughout the book.Nonetheless, their was some good content in this story. It does in the end have some interesting stories which will help you understand the region slightly better and one must respect Politkovskaya for her courage in writing such a story. Ultimately, If you are not interested in the political complexities surrounding Chechnya or already know and want first hand stories about the region this book is for you if not, save your money."
2,biased,"Politkovskaia is Russia's Jane Fonda, if you liked Hanoi Jane you'll love Grozny Anna. Why read her biased liberal sympathy for Chechnya, go straight to the source and read the kavkaz websites. Read the wahhabi rebels own propaganda and see some nice videos of wahhabi mujahadeen beheading Russian soldiers and Chechen sufis. Or read Osama bin Laden's praise for Chechen Islamist jihadists. Politkovskaia was called in for the Nord Ost terrorist raid to try to negotiate with the smertniki (suicide attackers)since she is known to be a sympathiser. Afterwards she wrote an article for a Russian liberal gazette about how the Russian theater hostages ""got what they deserved because Chechen rebels are suffering too."" You get the idea, reading her books, she does not relate Chechen rebels with al-Qaeda and Taliban supporting Wahhabi terrorists. Politkovskaia, Fonda."
1,Piece of trash by Russian liberal,"Do not waste your money. Piece of trash by Russian liberal. Bunch of lies and fairy tales about ""poor Chechens"" abused by Russians and deprived of their favorite national passtime - murder, kidnapping, slave trading. Lies, lies, lies. In the wake of September 11th events this book is an insult."
3,Not Quite Drukqs,"As other reviews have noted, this is not a new Aphex Twin album but a bunch of remixes from the days of yore. The fans who call this more ""listenable"" like the older works, which tend to be more slow/moody/boring (see ""Selected Ambient Works, vol. 2""). Personally, I much prefer his latest work, ""drukqs,"" which bounces back and forth between hard-hitting intensity and slow, somber pieces.""26 mixes for cash"" is good for Aphex Twin fans, especially those of his older works, or those who want to see how his style has changed. Otherwise, go for ""drukqs."""
1,Horrible hardware design,"I bought this unit and in 4 months, the unit would not start. Since panasonics' warranty only covers 3 months labor and labor costs more than the price of this unit it was better to buy another unit.Their customer service is very poor. I've read similar stories with these units after this problem happenned to me. I won't be buying panasonic anytime soon."
4,Great Watch,"This is a great looking watch and a great value. Not sure if anyone ever actually pays the referenced retail price, but at $89 it was a terrific deal. The watch is about average size for a man's watch, not too big, but not small enough to ever be mistaken as anything other than a man's watch. It actually looks better thna the pictures on the site - I have bought, and returned a number of watches both here and in the store and think I finally found a good match for me. The closure on the strap is a little tough if you haven't used this type before, but honestly, 1 click on the Stuhrling website gave easy instructions."
1,Not what I had hoped for,Goes on easy but smudges just as easy. Gave this to a friend who found the same problem. Would never purchase again.
1,Not very sturdy,These needles are nice and sharp and just the right size for hand quilting but the metal is just to flimsy. I bent the first needle with the first stitch and it broke in half on the second stitch. I would not recommend these if you are quilting material with lots of seams.
1,Moron Reporters,"This is the same moran reporter, Calabresi, who interviewed Scott Ritter, the former UN weapons inspector, and asked him about what he would call his exercise video (implying that he is like Jane Fonda). Talk about BAITING. Calabresi claimed Ritter was a traitor in the interview. I wouldn't put much TRUST in whatever this reporter claims."
5,Great Movie,"I loved both vesrions of Sparkle, however I'm a classic kind of person so I would have to recommend the original ""HANDS DOWN!!"" Irens Cara was superb as Sparkle and Lonette McKee played her role as sister. Sometimes Beauty isn't enough to get you where you need or want to go."
4,Sparkle,I enjoyed this movie; Amazon does a great job on picture quality. Didn't experience any problems accessing or streamling online and the cost was quite affordable.
3,Original Sparkle,This was an old movie that was low budget. So it was ok. I like the new version of this movie much better.
3,A split that didn't splat,"3 1/2This is indie rock's own little east-west bridge builder, one of those obnoxious double artist releases that actually doesn't feel like leftovers. You'll likely come wanting some of Cursive's awesome emotional starkness (which they half-provide) but leave admiring Eastern Youth's exuberant consistency (unmatched to at least a few of their less exciting full lengths)."
5,Ahhhh!!,"I never really got into the Eastern Youth songs on this cd but I give it a five star rating for the cursive songs alone. These are some of the best songs in the Tim Kasher songbook, topped only by the Burst and Bloom ep."
5,Weeds here I come.,"Look all over the find it other places, didn't want to purchasea new weed wacker, ordered it works fine"
2,always falling apart,"While my 3 year old loves scoop and bob the builder, scoops arm is constantly falling off which causes a lot of frustration. It does re-attach easily for an adult but my child cannot re-attach it."
1,Bob the Builder Talking Scoop,"I bought Scoop for my 2 1/2 year old who loves Bob the Builder. This item is poorly made. As you can see in other reviews...the arm keeps falling off. It frustrated my son...and me. We now can't find the arm. I do like that it is magnetic, which made it easier for my son to play with the boulders that came with it. And I like all the Bob the Builder sayings. But it is not a durable toy. The smaller, diecast ones are a lot better."
3,Could be better,"My son, 2 1/2, saw this in the store and had to have it. The backhoe does come off all the time; although my son doesn't really seem to mind. In fact sometimes he pulls it off just to have me put it back on. I end up putting it back on several times a day. Although this is not the best made toy out there, my son does like it and is asking for more Bob the Builder toys to go with it."
5,Great Book,"Harry James was a hero of mine when it came to playing the trumpet. I had no idea about his scandalous life. This was a very interesting book. One thing it helped me to understand, however, concerned the critics of Harry. These critics often say that he wasted his talent on pop when he could have been more of a jazz purist. True, but the book reveals that Harry wasn't interested in that. He was interested in making money, gambling it all away, chasing skirts, guzzling booze, etc.. Harry did what Harry wanted to do. This is a sad tale. He was a man with tremendous musical talent, but he used that talent as a means to an end, not an end in itself."
2,Inaccuracies abound,"It is too bad Mr. Levinson isn't still alive to ""repair"" his book. The premise of this book is to demonstrate all of Harry James' negative attributes. The book is replete with inaccuracies, defective timelines and some just plain untruths. My wife and I knew Harry James very well. In fact, my wife was the last vocalist Harry himself chose and yet Mr. Levinson never contacted her for an interview. It is a shame that there isn't a more accurate, compassionate depiction of the great Harry James' life. Read only if you have to!!"
4,A good Life in a Day book.,This was a Social Studies book. The book is interesting as it describes a day in the life of a Pilgrim girl using text and photographs from Plymouth Plantation. Anthony D. Fredericks recommended it in Social Studies Through Children's Literature and you can find accompanying questions and activities there. Recommended for grades K-3rd.
3,watch out for the glass tabletop!,"We received one large box with the entire set in it. My husband put it together without much difficulty. The quality of the furniture is worth the price paid. I would like to have bought a higher quality patio set, but I am picky and I like nice furniture. Of course that costs a lot more! But this set serves the purpose and will be put to good use on our patio.I must add one important caveat, though. Please be really careful with the glass tabletop! The glass part is packed in a bag with the wicker top, but not attached or secured. My husband set it aside upright against the house, and the glass slipped down unto the patio and shattered into a million pieces. It is not thick tempered glass, so be careful with it. Thank goodness it didn't break after we got it out of the plastic; we would have been cleaning up glass for a long time!"
2,Worst Nextel Phone in years,"I have used Nextel for a long time, I have used a lot of the phones, daily work use, on the phone and with the two way, web, and texting.The wide flat earpiece has a sharpish edge on the top that causes extreme discomfort when on the phone for more than just a few minutes.The screen is tiny and a giant step back in time, this is the same screen that was on my i700plus from like 2001? A horrible screen for trying to read text messages or news or scores.The sound quality is horrible and not steady, the volume seems to be different every time I make a call.The antenna is flimsy plastic and breaks very easily.The signal quality is poor and erratic.I have love my Motorola Nextel phones for a long time and would steer anyone away from this one.Horrible Phone."
2,"Cheaply made, cheaply priced","We've now purchased two more of these. They are cheaply made. The vinyl does tear easily. But they are very cheaply priced. I expected to replace it often, and I was not disappointed. Don't buy it if you are looking for something sturdy."
4,A Sharecropper's Daughter,"Sylvia takes us back to the red dusty roads of Georgia in the 40's & 50's. With her and her family we sharecrop, work in sawmills and cotton mills, and ""get saved.""Thomas Wolfe said ""You can't go home again,"" but through ""Eight Miles of Muddy Road,"" Sylvia Nickels sure gives it a heck of a try."
1,Creditless Manufacturer,"Creditless dishonest Manufacturer (Most possibly Dishonest Company from Taiwan). obvious on purpose depriving rebase check they promised before, double the support will not be honest as well. NEVER buy anything from this company."
5,Excellent CD for minimum investment,"Okay, when you cram 50 good to great songs on 2 CDs,...you know it's one hell of a deal. The 2002 Comp has a couple of live songs from the Australian tour. (Sum 41 wasn't on the American tour) Some goodies are NOFX's ""Three on Speed"", ""You Gotta Go!"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (my fave song on the comp) and the energetic and fun ""I Want to Be a Cholo"" by Manic Hispanic. The songs, even the live ones, are great quality. Though, if I could give this product 4 1/2 stars, I would. It leaves out some good bands that apparently weren't on the Australian tour, like Bad Religion, (who headlined with NOFX on the US tour) Anti-Flag, and Rancid. Sum 41 probably made a lot of hXc's (hardcores) mad because they're considered sXe (straight-edge)here in the States, but I'm a fan of both, so no disappointment here...."
2,not what i hoped for,this cd is ok but not what i expected.good charllote sum41 and manic are good but thats it.
5,Very Nice Cameo,"The pendant design was interesting, and the wormanship was excellent. The price was very good, and delivery was as promised."
5,A beautiful tribute to the best that ever was,"I am music director at Duquesne University's student radio station and happened upon a curious looking cd with Jaco's picture on it the other day. When I popped it into the cd player, I was amazed at the musicianship, production and soul of this recording. Discussions 1 and 2 are amazing as are the songs composed by Jaco himself. I highly recommend this beautiful tribute to any music lover."
5,Excellent traditional jazz.,"I am a jazz musician and a friend had sent this to me. These guys are very tight and are very good for not being professionals. By that meaning they dont do it for a living. I think the idea behind the cd is great as well. I recommend that anyone who appreciates good jazz, purchase this. and even if you arent a jazz fan, buy it and give it to a friend. Its for a great cause.....the kids.Be well my freinds and keep playin."
3,Jeep,I'm not sure if these was meant to be a toy or not but in our house it was used as a toy. The pieces break off very easily. This was probably 3rd replacement one we bought for our son.
2,so-so chess primer,"This author offers suggestion for improving one's approach to the game. But to me, the suggestions were not that helpful. They suggest memorizing the color of every square, but this did nothing for me."
1,See Spot Run,This book is possibly the worst I have ever read. It is written at about a fourth grade level and takes a whole 5 minutes to read cover to cover. I got more info on Marine Force Recon surfing the net then I did by reading this book. Do not buy this book unless your 9-year-old child is interested in becoming a Recon Marine.
1,Couldn't Have Heen Any Worst Than That,"This book is really terrible. You'll get less than 50 pages of nothing for your 23 dollars. The writing level is so low that one might ask if it went through any editing process. My advice is to avoid this book at any cost. I gave it a ""1"" star for the rating only because I didn't have any choice to give it an even lower rating."
2,A fairly common guide with expensive tastes,"I was attracted to this book by Penelope Casas because I had found her cookery books very useful and authentic. I was also intrigued by the subtitle 'An uncommon guide'. However I have found this to be quite a common guide - not much here that others haven't written in other guidebooks about. Also the author seems to have very expensive tastes in accommodation and eating places. My experience in Spain has been that the most expensive is generally neither the best nor the most authentic.This guidebook seems, as it claims itself in the spiel on the back cover, is definitely for an American readership."
3,fun toy for a toddler,"My 3 year son loves these toys. They have no holes, so bathtub fun is included. I only wish they were more to scale relative to each other, but he does not care."
2,Great idea but bad product devlopment,I use a tape daily and I must say the useing this tape is a pain I have gone back to my old spring loaded tape. this thing is HEAVY for real and it takes to long to run out and when it does it buckles. the only reason I didn't fling this thing back to Sears is my ten year old son gave it to me so I use it when he is around but as soon as he goes in out of sight back it the tool bag it goes. Don't buy this thing.
3,lazy mans tape measure.,"Mostly this is a novelty, but there are times when it actually comes in very useful. It is noisy and bulky, but when on a ladder and you want to scoot out the tape level so it won't bend, it is great. I call it a ""GUY"" toy."
2,Clumsy Tape Measure,The physical size and weight of this tool makes it difficult to use unless you have both hands free. A second set of fresh batteries did little to improve tape extension beyond about five feet. The tape should be motorized for rewind also so that if it should happen to fold you could retract and extend it again more easily.
4,"awesome, awesome, and even more awesome","I love this magazine it's everything i want to know about in the entertainment world in just one magazine. Amazing! Only downfall is that I wish that it had more info on video games, but other than that this is one sweet magazine, highly recommend this mag!"
5,A fan of the magazine.,I have been a subscriber of this magazine for the past 3 years or more. It keeps me in touch with what is happening in the entertainment world at a glance.
5,Awesome!!!,I have been a big fan of Entertainment Weekly so I usually purchase it through them directly but I wont do that anymore! Ordering through Amazon was extremely easy and i couldnt believe how fast i started to receive my subscription so I highly recommend them to anyone!!
3,Puff pieces on pop products,Long running mag provides a dependable thumbnail sketch of what's new or coming up in the pop culture. Want to get an idea of the new movies coming out on Friday - it's here. Or new popular music on release Tuesday - it' here. No as much though with DVD or personal devices offerings. Well there's only so much that can be covered in week. still provides a bit of deversion and fun and is never self important or condescending to it's readers. Could use more of the b*tchiness of the old Premiere magazine but I guess the 80s are over. Lizzy Gelber-Waxner (sp?) is always a hoot though and it's great they brought that back.And unlike Rolling Stone which often seems stuck in the 60s EW doles out reviews of new artists which gives it a bit of relevance. Though hate the dreaded picture issues which can be scanned and recycled in 10 minutes.
1,Doesn't work with IChat or Skype,I was surprised to find that this works not at all with iChat and very poorly with Skype. I've bought MacAlly items before and have found them to be good products. Not this webcam. To use with Ichat you must BUY another program. Got it to work once with Skype after I reinstalled both Skype and the Ice Cam drivers. Next time I started up Skype same thing happened. Not worth the money.
3,Interesting Views,"Wow, I read a review that said, ""This is absoultely ridiculous ... how can amazon actually post this on their site ..... Dearest Mr. Bezos: Either your unamerican or completely unaware and oblivious to what's being sold on amazon -- whichever the case is, you've lost another customer to BarnesAndNobles.com""Interesting.How dare a bookseller sell a book? How dare he make money on a business he built from the ground up? He's a freakin' businessman! Your opinion reminds me of those who nod at whatever the government says, refuse to rock the boat and think folks who dare express opinions different from yours are equal to terrorists.It's a freakin' book for god's sake! It's one person's opinion..."
3,Very Quick Read,"The book is very sparse, with about 4 to 10 lines per page. The poems are presented in the translated English. If the original Greek were included, the book could be more of a display piece, and a bit more interesting to those who can read Ancient Greek.The included illustrations are a bit odd, though I am sure they appeal to some."
1,AMERICA IS THE ENEMY!!!!!!!,"I found this season very hard to watch as the Americans were the bad guys. No matter what anyone else did, the Americans were always blamed or thought to be the greater evil even more than a nuclear Iran. Interesting perspective. It appears to be anti-American propaganda. I liked the early seasons of MI-5 but did not care for this one. The low rating is not for the price but for the content."
2,wished illustrations in book were in color,bought this for granddaughter. Disappointed that I was unable to see inside book before ordering. I would have opted for a book illustrated in color.
3,Xmas Present for a kid,"I was asked to buy a present about space for my very bright 5 year old grandson who is reading very well. I read the reviews and thought this book would be great but apart from being to advanced for him, I found the presentation dull and the articles aimed at wildly differing age ranges. I have put it aside and give it to him in a couple of years time."
5,Great book for your star gazers!,We bought this last year for our 7 yr old daughter because we also bought her a telescope. She loves her new telescope and we use this book as a reference guide all the time!
2,"BARGAIN BASEMENT TRANSFER, GOOD MOVIE","Disney treats its customers like so much trash, and insults the artists it paid to make these films. This transfer is absolutely miserable -- washed out, soft and nearly unwatchable. It's a sign of the contempt they feel for their own customers that the wiseguys at Disney would ignore complaints about the quality of this disc and just take the money. They should be ashamed of themselves, but they're morally incapable of shame.Amazon should post a warning. A rip off at any price."
5,Feather light weed trimmer spool,I looked everywhere for this product. The stores were out and did not plan to order new stock since it was the end of summer sales. Well in Texas summer can run all the way into December. I needed the string. Amazon had it and it shipped fast. I bought three spools and the cost was the same or less than what I would have paid in the store. Free shipping too.
2,fails itself,"I liked how this film started. It was coherent and well acted. Emma had creepy little eyes and I was waiting to see how creepier she got with her possessive obsessive secretly dykish mind-games. However from the time that she seducers Marie ( 1/3 way through) the film enters on a slippery slope. The crux is that Marie's complicity ; opposition; mixed feelings about a lesbian affair were not clear. It left a void inside the film that confused me and by the end I felt cheated because this film had a lot of promise.Assuming the director is a French women and that the great speciality of French films is to pluck apart feelings and delight in exploring the details., the void in the film is surprising. The only explanation is that the director took on a screen-play about lesbianism but hasn't a clue about its dynamics or Marie's mixed feelings. The strange irony is even Emma gets confused by Marie. !!!!"
5,Great Clubs - Great Weight - Great Value,These clubs are way better than the Juggling Clubs by Juggling Clubs listed on Amazon. I friend of mine bought those and they fall apart and are light wight and cheap feeling. These are way better. Spend the extra money and get these.
1,This could have made a very interesting memoir,I think if the author hadn't written his memoir in such a vain way--it would have been better??
5,Timeless. Marian Mcpartland.,"This an apt title for this disc the lady is timeless as she finally stepped down from public radio in 2011 now that she is 94. This a collection of tunes & trios 1952/3, they are played with own style & technique. No one tune stands more than another. A GREAT ALBUM."
1,I did not like this game,"Although Wario is one of my favorite Nintendo characters, this game definitely has knocked him down the rank a little. I guess I was not expecting the raw anime that this game has. I was very dissapointed."
3,OK at best,"This game is not too bad , great for kids ! !Levels are over too quick and graphics are kinda cheesey ...."
4,Good Program,"Perhaps the only program about Boston in the first half of the 20th century. Well documented and narrated. The VHS tape was new, as advertised, and delivery was within 2 weeks. I'm very satisfied."
2,So so,"No lyrics on the screen. The arrangements are sort of jazzy but a little empty sounding. Also, it might help if the recorded singer at least could sing!"
5,Excellent source of information on the Koyukon of Alaska,I really enjoyed Nelson's book and found it helpful in my research on the Koyukon people.This is ed in specifics.Nelson presents a sensitive and unbiased ethnography that is well written and enjoyable to read.
5,Anthropology and Humility,"A fresh direction for anthropological study that is from the ""inside."" The author lives ""among"" the people and learns from them, taking pains to distinguish the influence of ""western"" cultural values. The relationship between this ""outsider"" and the people who recieve him among them should be the model for all such explorations."
2,Barely ok,I've seen many martial arts films & this one somehow does not draw or entertain me; it's not one I'd like to see again. There's nothing wrong with the seller or the delivery or the product itself; it's just a forgettable movie
4,One of the best Holocaust novels for children,"Based on a true story, Marilyn Sachs' saga of a young Jewish girl in Nazi-occupied Paris is vivid and heartbreaking. The characters are exceptionally well-drawn, the prose and dialogue smooth and effortless. A first-rate work by one of our finest children's authors. Highly recommended for children ages 10 and up."
4,great garage rock from future Walkmen members,"I picked this up very cheaply recently and have found it to be worth every penny. Joking aside, this is a very cool rock record featuring Hamilton Leithauser and Peter Bauer of the Walkmen, one of my favorite bands. Recorded in the late 90s, it wasn't released on CD until 2003. Three songs were eventually re-recorded by the Walkmen (That's the Punch Line and The Blizzard of '93 ('96) released on Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone, and Look Out Your (the) Window on a split EP with Calla). The music is not too far removed from the Walkmen, 60s influenced garage rock but with far less organ and piano. Song of the Paper Dolls is a great opener, showcasing Leithauser's slurred vocals. Other highlights include That's the Punch Line, Modern Art Museum, and Shake Off Your Nerve). There are some errors in the tracklisting as the other reviewer mentioned."
4,Short Book,It's a small book but it does pack a punch. Most of the 25 mistakes to avoid are kind of no-brainers...like stay neat and clean in appearance. All in all it was worth the small amount I paid for it.
5,Refreshingly Different,"Excellent CD from beginning to end, If they ever tour the US in the future I WILL be there. All songs are in German and even if you don't understand it doesn't matter, the feelings are the same. To say that they are talented and enjoy their music would be an understatement."
5,Cool Toy,"If you go in our backyard, you could see small bits and pieces of ropes. We have two Pit bulls and they just love to grovel themselves up with toys that they can grind their teeth on. I would usually buy them different of sorts but the toys would not last long.When I found this Dog toy, I jumped right into buying it. I was so excited in showing my new babies their new toy. I think I was actually more excited than them. So, when I showed this to my dogs, they started playing with it right then and there.What's great about this rope toy is that it doesn't make my dogs feel sick upon swallowing the fibers that have lodged in their mouth. I researched that this toy is made up of cotton in that it doesn't bring harm to your dogs digestive tract. It is also sturdy. I mean, my Pit bulls are extremely aggressive when playing with it and it lasted with us over 9 months."
5,Excellent! Best blender I've owned!,"Other reviewers have covered this in pretty good detail, so I won't go too far into it. But, it's the best blender I've owned by a long-shot. I'm a 1-smoothie a day person, minimum.I sometimes use it 3 times a day. It blends in a circular motion that somehow makes the drink always come out very smooth... no chunks and you don't have to overload it with liquidto get it going. Priced right, as well. Definitely recommend it for those who blend regularly!"
3,John Howard just does not make a good Bulldog,"It looks like Capt. Hugh Chesterton 'Bulldog' Drummond (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket. He almost loses the wedding rings, but with a little ingenuity and a stick of American gum they are retrieved. A lot of good that does him as it turns out a scientist is missing along with an extraordinary explosive formula. Only Bulldog finds out the hard way with a severed arm containing a familiar ring. Col. J.A. Nielson (John Barrymore) of Scotland Yard wants to know how Bulldog fits in the situation.Yes this is a formula spy story with a Bulldog Drummond overlay. Based on the novel ""The Return of Bulldog Drummond."""
2,Awkward bag- NOT recommended,"I registered for this bag before my son was born, and was thrilled to receive it; but once I actually tried to use it, I had the same complaints I'm now seeing on here. It constantly slides off my shoulders, and I can't keep it up, which is maddening. And, I found the mesh compartments inside to be awkward to use, small capacity, and difficult to access with other stuff in the bag. I liked that it has 3 main compartments, but without being able to use them effectively, this bag has ended up being mostly useless."
5,Charmed Again and Again,"Any CHARMED fan would be most pleased with this newly released action and mystery packed seventh season. This is of one of the best TV series ever ran. This season also includes the unforgettable guest return episode of Juilan McMahon (Cole Turner) being an assistnace to Piper to make a final mends with Phoebe. Oh Yes...and Let's not forget about the ""Avitars"". This is a must have for the CHARMED collectors."
4,charmed are excellent shows,"my family loves the charmed series, there are several good plots and characters in the series. their are several good actors and actresses."
5,charmed fan forever,"i just want to say that i glad all the seasons are coming out faster then other shows i like, i also have the unaired pilot of charmed. i glad they didn't use the actor and actoress for the series"
4,"Excellent primer, concise, informative","I've been paging through this book for a few years now - this is the latest rendition - and always find useful stuff. The writing is clear and concise and the concepts are adequately explained. This won't satisfy the more seasoned investor who will want books that delve more deeply into the arcania of individual investments but for most people who simply want to better understand investing and money management this is hard to beat.For beginning investors this will be a trove of information. The authors explain how particular investments work, what to look for in different vehicles, and how to make decisions concerning investments and your portfolio. For more experienced investors it serves as a reminder for the basics that seem to get lost so easy in all the options of more sexy investments (that are usually less profitable.)Great book."
2,investing guidebook,"This is a very basic review of investing for only the least informed. At the same time those with limited knowledge will find it hard to read. It lacks detail and as a result, lacks in-depth explanations that could clarify many of the areas that are covered. Specifically the section on Options trading was very poor. There are few ""teaching"" moments that you would expect to find in a ""Guidebook""."
3,Lot's of heat...but,"I bought this burner for brewing beer in a 15 gallon pot. All in all, it's not a bad burner. It generates a lot of heat. However, my unit came with instructions for an entirely different model, so I was flying blind on the assembly and flame adjustment. That's a result of poor quality control. Did I say that it generates a lot of heat?? It also rocks a little bit..."
1,arrived in poor shape,This thing just arrived and its in poor shape! The spring for the reg attachment is smashed. The whole thing is unable to line up for the heat shield to go on and the bolts that hold the burner in place even when tightened all the way sit loose. Not what I expected for 80 some bucks. Thought I was moving up in quality from the 40 dollar job I had previously but the opposite was true. All this and I haven't even put a flame to it yet.
4,Keggle users be aware,"Package arrived in excellent condition. Nice heavy, sturdy frame. My only issue which is my fault is that I was planning on using this on a keggle brewing system. The keggle's bottom outer ring just barely fits on all four of the holders. It's a little nerve-wracking having this much hot water teetering on the burner. Also since the bottom of the keggle isn't wide enough to fully cover the burner there is a lot of heat that is being lost here (and possibly affecting the brewmometer that I installed. I'm going to create a small skirt/heat shield something or other to combat my issues but am still happy that I have this burner."
4,Bayou Classic KAB$,"Product was deliverd in good shape, used it to boil 10 gal of liquids in about 15-20 min, which is a lot faster then the other burner I was using which took up to 45min to bring the same amount to boil. I was also able to complete the task in two hours rather then the 6 hrs with the old way. Puts out a lot of heat. Was easy to use and has decent adjustability/ control. If you have a large job/ production use then this is the burner assembly to use."
2,Too Preachy,"Darren is constantly trying to write message songs. This rarely works. Hayes has an amazing voice, and this is his problem. He used this beautiful voice to cover up mediocre lyrics. Outside of Luka and Big Yellow Taxi few good message songs have ever been written, they just come across as preachy.When Hayes says ""Harry dropped the bomb anyway,"" he kills a decent song by showing he knows nothing of history. Why not focus on what you know about?There are few singers today with as much talent as Hayes, and it's a pity he's covering up weak material with such a beautiful voice. Hire a decent songwriter and get back to universal topics like love or even a celebration of music, like the song ""Spin"" could've been had it not been a mere message song"
4,Actually not bad,"To be quite honest, I did not have that great of an expectation of this movie...with it being not first rate, I did pass this one over for a bit...then I decided what the hang, and put it in...was I surpised...this movie had a decent story, that really did keep you guessing who was the killer...good action sequences, acting was actually pretty good too...it is a bit gory at times, but hang in there and you may look over that for the content of the story..."
3,Well I'd like to rate it...,But it was NEVER released in the theatres... I saw pretty interesting trailers for this movie. Got me all curious only to find out it's going straight to DVD... IN SEPTEMBER (4 months away from this post). Dont you hate that?Guess I'll look forward to the DVD.
2,Too much gore and not enough story,The story line is poorly written. It was gore for the sake of gore. THe turns and twists were not possible uless it was a ghost that carried out the murders.
3,"Enjoyable ""Who Dunnit?"" Film!!!","I really enjoyed ""Mindhunters"". Sure the plot was predictable in some parts and a bit cheesy in others...but overall, the acting and the action were great!!! I enjoyed watching the characters try to guess who was suspect by analyzing each other's strenghts and weaknesses and I couldn't wait to see what trap was planned for who! Also, any film featuring shots of L.L. Cool J in a tank top is worth viewing if for those shots alone. *grinWould definitely recommend!"
4,Worked fine as labels.,"Used them to make some labels for a project. Worked ok. Put some clear polyurethane spray over top for some extra durability. Make sure you get enough letters for extras, because you might mess up a couple while trying them out."
3,All Right,"One movie has a young Jennifer Welles as a brunet under a different name. These are mid 60's sexplotaion movies so are tamer than thoses done in the 70's, but worth it."
2,disappointing,"I picked this book up expecting to read something like The Thooth fairy,wich was an exelent book,but I found this book to be completely different as it mixes some stupid wife-beating-husband family drama with fantasy.It is got a minnimal dose of the bizarre kind of fantasy that made The tooth fairy great.By the end the book looks very rushed.It steadily looses quality.I would only recommend this book to people into wicca,otherwise you may find this book lacking,specially if you are looking for something like The Thooth Fairy"
3,It Works.,"Let me first say that this is a $40 rear wheel mounted cycle computer that estimates power output. Real power meters cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars. Keep that in mind because this item seems to be made very cheaply. And also remember that this computer only estimates power on the trainer, it is not a power meter. It will not accurately estimate power on the road. It depends on knowing the power curve of the Kinetic trainers to estimate the wattage. So, as the title implies, although it looks cheaply made, it does work. It does display all the usual functions: time, speed, distance, power, and the average/max for each applicable function. For me, I use it because I needed a rear wheel mounted computer for the trainer and I couldn't afford a real power meter. I would've liked to pay a little more for better construction though."
4,Nice cyclocomputer,"This is the ""W"" model. It doesn't do heart rate or altitude so no need for a chest strap like the ""WL"" model. I bought it to use with my Kinetics Road Machine and Specialized Hard Rock bike. It took a bit of time to figure out the placement for the sensors for speed and cadence but in the end it seems well laid out. The manual is small and the pictures a bit hard to understand but the company was great and sent me a PDF version of the manual. The most difficult to understand is the arrangement for the Lap Timers but those won't be of that much use for me just now and the rest of the functions seem to work well. This unit was about the same price as the Strada CC-RD300W Wireless but has a larger display and includes cadance and power, which I really wanted."
2,A disappointing album from a great DJ,"DJ Irene is great at spinning high energy sets. She mixes together trance, hard house, disco, and whatever else fits her fancy at the moment. She never lingers too long, so you don't have to worry if a selection isn't quite your thing. I've enjoyed her live several times and absolutely love her ""Fearless"" album.That said, I don't really like this CD. It seems like there are enough popular songs so you'll think it will be easy to enjoy (eg: Tiesto, PPK, Cosmic Gate), but it never quite gels together in the same way her previous mixes have. Not only are there some pacing issues, but there's too many songs where I felt like hitting the skip button. Part of that for me is the increase in the amount of house on this CD, as I prefer a trancier sound. But on ""Fearless"" she kept the house/disco interesting, it never felt like it was dragging.This CD dissapointed me, and I cannot recommend it. Get ""Fearless"" instead."
2,rusty grommets instantly,"Within days of putting these lounge chairs in our yard, the grommets became rusty and looked horrible. Very comfortable and very heavy loungers that are not what I would call easily transportable, hence, they stay where you put them. I would not buy them again and am very disappointed. Why such low quality hardware??...doesn't make sense to me. Should return them, maybe I will.....wonder if I still can...."
2,Disappointing,"This cartridge has a good selection of games but I was disappointed overall. The box says there are sound effects, but actually there are none, only some annoying music (which you can turn off). When you save your game, it only seems to remember your balance, not your name or the fact that you have turned off the music. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the instruction manual offered no help. I found the blackjack game to be difficult to follow since the game doesn't tell you whether you won or lost the hand, it only tells you when you bust or tie the dealer. You have to actually watch your money balance to see the result. I also found the controls to be confusing and I have found a couple bugs as well. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend."
4,Good value for money,"I am not hard on my cell phone but decided to get this case because the iphone is fairly expensive. I have not dropped it yet, so can't vouch for how well the case protects the phone from a fall on a hard floor. However, it does fit well, is not bulky and feels nice in my hands. Seems like it will protect well from a drop and I sure hope so."
3,Question,Hi I have a question for those who have this game...I used to have the Sims but can't find it anywhere and want to play it with the girl I babysit for. I have tons of expansion CDs and was wondering if I buy this if it will work on my new Dell with Vista. Anyone know? Or does it just work with old PCs?Thanks!
3,A busywork kind of game,"To me this game is like pointless math worksheets. It may be fun and interesting, but the families soon become messed up. The graphics are OK. I would buy the Sims 2 over the original, because the graphics are better and there are more options. My copy came free with my computer, and I'll admit that I occassionaly play it when I'm bored. Sims has poor quality graphics and isn't worth paying for. There is no point in the game, and it never ends. Personally, I enjoy games with a goal, so I have something to work for. It's great when your bored, but not if your in the mood for adventure."
3,Army Men: To Buy or Not To Buy?,"I bought this game quite a while ago. It was really hard for me at first. The controlls take quite a bit of getting used to but once you get it down you won't be troubled by anything. I found myself stumbling around looking for what I had to do next a few times but it wasn't any real problem. You can finish the game in a few hours.It has a few voice samples, namely when you find a weapon or health. The graphics are nothing great and the music is simply a beating drum, litterally. If you like shoot-um-up games though, buy it. I really liked it at first. But truth be told, after I beat it I haven't picked it up again."
4,Really easy. But fun,"This game has 28 missions. I beat the game in almost an hour which is really fast for me.the game play is okay,pretty good for a game boy color cartridge. You get 2 vehicles a jeep and tank. The story is good for game boy. And the graphics are good to. this is a fun mobile game. Some of the maps in the game are from the Pc version with slight diffrences. This is not from playstation like some of the other guys said. It is extremly easy so I give 4 stars. Army men 2 is a little better tho since Sarge can run a lot faster in that one."
4,Wacky and weird: a great way to learn some history,"Irreverent, goofy, funny, entertaining, and educational: all apply to this unique book. This particular book gives a good account of evolution. Lots of fun, which clearly has educational value. The second book, vols 8-13, is not nearly as entertaining. If you don't mind some fun being poked at traditional religious beliefs, this is a good history book for older kids and adults."
2,1% of the exitement of real tanks,"I'd reccomend this game only to a young gamer who really likes tanks. There are only 3 tanks to choose from, and only 2 weopon powerups which aren't any good anyway. There are only about 4 different type of enemy which are easy to kill, and no end of stage bosses, Poor music and sound FX, and a unimaginative story line make this game look like it was thrown together over the weekend. Had potential."
3,13 year old gamer,This game is awesome. It takes a while to get down the wierd steering bot after that it's fun. It's story line is kinda boring but thats what youd expect from gameboy.I gave it three stars because it took only a few hours to beat. Another good thing about it is that you can play individual stages after u beat the game. The real downfall of the game is that you can't save. After every level you get a stupid password that uses pictures of tanks instead of numbers or letters. I reccomend this game to everyone. It has it's bad sides but it's really cool
2,boring,you guys who said this book was going downhill well you were write these new authors probly didnt even readthe other books ok it was a LITTLE ( keyword little) better. JOANNA PLEASE COME BACK (...).
4,Good But could be better,"Okay, Glory does race a good race. Then they found out that Glory was drugged. But what I don't understand why Lavinia can come and say something that Cindy doesn't know about. And I wish Mike would teel Clay what they are doing one of these times. Dr. Smith was telling Cindy something about one of the drugs and they have know clue where Jim is. And when Jim said he thought the bags were in the barn and went to get them he had the perfect oppertunnuty to drug Glory And when Max and Cindy were revuing the evidence how could they have forgot that Jim could come in and drug him any time. Jim could have drugged him right after the race to so he would come up posotive. I think they should think more in the book."
3,Whats Going On?,I love the series but sometimes you know what is going to happen. The people are so stupid sometimes it is unbelievable. The races must be pretty long to consider the # of lengths Glory won by. I hate Cindy and everything that goes with her. Ashleigh was so cool and Samantha was alright but I hate Cindy. Why cant they stay with a neat Character once in a while. I have books 1-17 and 21 and 22. i dont think i will go very high in the series. Thanks!
3,Fair to middlin,This tool helped me a lot; however it wasted a lot of spray because it is difficult to aim accurately. Hence one must go over areas more than once to hit a specific target. Other than that I was well pleased.
2,Trombone Sprayer,I purchased the trombone sprayer two years ago and it worked fine. The 3rd year it did not work. I cant send it back and I am out $44.00So I guess I will have to try to fix it...Hudson will not allow me to return it for a replacement.
3,"Not bad, but has one problem.","I have been using this for a year for spot watering dry places in my yard. It's especially useful for small areas and it is much better than the Nelson equivalent which has serious uniformity problems.The only issue with this one seems to be that it starts to leak profusely after a while because the internal water connection becomes loose. It can easily be repaired as follows:1. Remove the single screw from the bottom and lift off the rotating top.2. Pull out the round water transfer fitting on the base (identifiable by the small rubber O-ring).3. Remove the metal spring washer, which has probably become flattened out over time.4. Bend the spring washer into a more warped shape. It's best to bend it in thirds rather than in half.5. Put spring washer back on and reassemble the way it came apart.I intend to get another one of these for my other hose. Very handy."
3,Couldn't hold as much as expected,"Item is in dimensions described and extends easily. However, the areas to hold the silverware are not as deep as we were expecting and can not hold that much (about 15 forks)."
4,"Easy to use, basic outdoor burner","I bought this burner for brewing and am happy with the product. It was super easy to put together myself while my boyfriend was watching football! The discoloration to the frame that other reviewers noted is just the powder coat (maybe it's epoxy paint?) finish burning off. I experienced it myself, but it's just around the burner and going to happen no matter what they use to coat the steel frame to prevent corrosion. The construction is not the best quality, but certainly will work for my purposes and let's face it, it's cheap!!! My only real complaint is that the frame leaves you with no adjustability for uneven surfaces. I was on a walkway that was not perfectly level and had to improvise so that my 7.5 gallon brew kettle was level. Might be nice in the next rev to add some threaded feet or at least drill and tap the bottoms of the legs so that I can add something myself."
4,great burner.,"I have had an sq-14 burner for about 3 years, and wanted another one or two for my homebrew setup. This one has the widest flame range (you could get things hotter more quickly but you'll use more lp)- the first one shipped was defective (stand ok, cast iron burner broken) but returning was much easier than i thought. had a replacement within a couple of days."
4,Great Burner at A Great Price,My wife bought me this as a Father's day gift so I could move my home-brewing off the stove and onto the back porch. works awesome. My only complaint is that the burner itself has a single bolt in it that holds it to the frame but is otherwise unsupported meaning the flame will be tilted slightly away from your kettle if you don't wire the burner with a support where the regulator attaches to it. Otherwise this thing is a beast and great for home-brewing.
5,Good Stuff,"I bought this for home brewing. It needs a homemade wind screen (cardboard)to work at its best. Getting used to the regulator takes a couple of brews, but over all this is a great product."
5,rock solid,"I'm using this for home brewing beer. This burner is built really well, and throws out enough heat to bring 6 gallons of wort to a boil in a short amount of time. It's wide enough to hold a big brew/stock pit very securely. My stove is thanking me, and so is my wife."
4,Great for Homebrewers,Once I got the air flow plate adjusted correctly the burner worked like a charm! Brought 4 gallons of wort to a boil in 10-15 minutes with an outside ambient temp of +/-50d F! When the wind kicked up the flame barely moved. The stand is very sturdy and has a large enough base to fit a large (15 gallon) pot. I'd recommend this burner to any homebrewer!I would have given the burner 5 stars but I have a few nitpicks. I'd like to see a longer hose to my propane tank. I really wish that the instructions were more informative; there was no literature instructing the end user on how to adjust the flame for maximum efficiency.
3,DANCIN IN THE STREETS,"I WAS NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THIS DVD, DAVID RUFFIN WAS EXCELLENT HIS VOICE WAS IN TOP FORM, ALTHOUGH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE EDDIE KENDRICKS HIS VOICE WAS NOT THERE BUT IT WAS GREAT SEEING HIM, I CAN'T EVEN REMEBER ANY OTHER ARTIST THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING"
2,"Motown revue is sad nostalgia, weak performance.","In 1987, several of Motown's greatest legends toured the nation in a nostalgic revue. Shortly thereafter, most of them died, including David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks and Mary Wells. This is a record of the concert and it's wildly uneven. Yes, there's a few magic moments, for example, Ruffin singing ""My Girl,"" and Martha Reeves generates some electricity on ""Jimmy Mack."" But even more frequently, you can see that these artists are past their prime; occasionally, Ruffin, who easily had one of the greatest voices in pop history, sounds little better than any average voice. Sometimes corny, other times uplifting, but never when they try to be, which is too frequently."
4,Great Last Look at former Motown Singers,"I viewed the Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin parts of the DVD and that alone is worth the price. Eddie seems to really be into the show.Especially look at ""I Know I'm Losing You"" where Eddie is Running all over the place and even leaves his Falsetta to steal a few lead lines from David while David looks with Admiration.Good show from former Motown greats."
4,"A great last look at Mary Wells, David & Eddie","This video either on VHS or DVD is one of the last looks at these great artists. Mary Wells was beginning to show the signs of her fatal illness, but covered well in this show from early in the 1987 tour. Likewise with David Ruffin & Eddie Kendricks. The fake Temptations don't cut it, but a solo Martha Reeves (before she went back to using Vandellas) fills out this treat from the past. Only Martha is left!"
5,great work considering it is 8 years old,"back when dj paul and juicy j were selling tapes from audio and radio stores in memphis. i have been waiting forever it seems to get this on cd. paul or j if you read this, what about ""come with me to hell pt.2""? it needs to be next on the list."
1,So why did you Censor this film,"This is the english release fo Hugo the movie star.Do yourself a big favor and don't buy it.The english voice acting is horrable, and the stars of the filmspend endless min's making squeaking and beeping sounds.Most of all one of the best acted parts in the original animationis compleatly cut out of the US relase. Thanks for nothing."
3,"Great, sad video","This video is more like a review of 2004 season so dont go in expecting full Philadelphia Eagles history. The video starts off slow and corny and then eventually begins to pick up speed. It highlights the failure that Eagles fans had to endure and really highlights it. The video honestly made me proud and depressed. But in the end, the longing for a super bowl was definitely more noticeable within myself."
1,Grinder,Suggestion:Take this off your site! I can stop the grinding wheel with my hand ~ no exaggeration. This is a piece of junk!
1,A photocopy of the book,This book had the original cover but the inside pages are a very low quality photocopy. The pictures of quilts are in black and white and smeared. I am sure the information is as the writers originally intended but the quality of the print is BAD! Amazon should warn customers that this book is a photocopy and in black and white only.
4,Perfect for my kitchen chairs,"My kitchen chairs needed new pads because they were scraping up my wood floors. These were perfect. The adhesive is really sticky and so far they are doing a good job protecting my floor.Also, they got to me in one day, which was awesome."
5,Scratch-proof your floor for cheap,Waxman really hit a home run with these felt pads. I put them on all my kitchen chairs and they glide like butter. I can't say enough good things about these chair protectors.I still have some left and I want to go buy more chairs so I can slide them around on my floor!It's that fun!Really!
1,NOT! for every day use!,"I purchased this Waxman product for the bottoms of my kitchen chairs on a tile floor. First thing to go was the adhesive within the first week of application. So I had remove the gummy surface & then applied super glue. These lasted for maybe a couple of months before they were worn down and shot with the chairs back to scraping the tiled floor. Does ANYONE make an enduring product these days? I thought the term ""heavy duty"" would have been a shoe-in. Alas! ...twas not :-("
4,Songs from the past that are still acceptable to listen to.,Indian Reservation and Follow Your Drum were Don's best charted songs.Other songs such as Letter and Gimme Gimme Good Lovin' werealso great songs that became hits by other artists.Overall Don Fardon contributed extremely well to the music industry.
2,So bad I kept reading to see how bad it could get,"How did this book get published? Was there no editor? First, the point of view is all over the place. One minute it's the author speaking, then it's one character thinking first person, then third person, then another character thinking or speaking, then a totally ambiguous voice. Bizarre. And it was never clear to me what era it was. They had cell phones, but it seemed as if it were maybe the 60s. Amanda's family in Mississippi were sterotypical, so backward they were unreal. Most of the dialogue throughout was corny and boring and unnatural. There wasn't a character in the book that I really liked. I grew bored with the references to Norma's legs. Sheesh. What a weak device that was."
2,BORING,This book is a real bore. Waste of money. I liked her books so I bought this one. What a drag. Nothing. I mean nothing is new here. What a disappointment.
3,Deer Support Group?,"When two members of the Deer Abused Support Group are murdered, Kate Jasper is unwittingly pulled into the thick of things and asked to investigate. Kate's secret marriage to Wayne Caruso is advertised all over the place by a loud-mouthed reporter, and Kate is also being threatened by an animal rights group called Deer Count who think that Kate's group is out to kill off all the deer who have been mangling their gardens. The only downside to this book is that you start out with a group of people so it is sometimes hard to organize your thoughts and remember who is who. However, it is a great addition to the author's Kate Jasper series which includes just the right amount of murder, mayhem, and humor."
3,haha i bought the wrong thing.,"Yeah, i bought the wrong type, and the customer service at TigerDirect wasn't that helpful at helping me return it. i had to wait for ups to come and refuse the package, which meant i had to be home. so that interfered with my week."
1,Head Lights,How would anybody know what these are like when Amazon says they are not available and dont know if they are even going to have them again! Ridiculous!
5,Revelation Verse by Verse by William R. Newell,"Last year I read Newell's Verse by Verse study of Hebrews and found his insights on grace and the whole purpose of the gospel brought a new perspective to my relationship with Christ. He looks at each verse with great scholarship, but does not stop there. He brings each concept home to practical application, by examining the heart issues. His analysis is detailed, devotional, and reveals the intentions of the heart. I often find scholarly studies are too intellectual; I prefer devotionals or the personal analysis style of Beth Moore. This is all that and more. I haven't even started reading the Revelation book, but I'm sure it will be equally wonderful, providing insights on a very mysterious book of the Bible, with a balanced perspective."
3,Is This Gamera's Movie?,"I know Gamera had two fights, but one was short. Barugon may be one of Gamera's most amazing enemies, but out of an hour and a half, Gamera gets 20 minutes of screen time while Barugon gets half the movie! Still I like the battles and Gamera looks destructive. I like the fact that Barugon is a mutated demon. I would of given it 4 but the DVD's terrible."
3,Big Turtle vs. Freezer-tongue,"Gamera must stop destroying things and save japan from the horrid Barugon, a gigantic lizard with a mile-long tongue that shoots a frosty, fire-extinguisher-like blast. Barugon also emits a killer rainbow (??!) from out of it's back! Gamera isn't in it as much as I'd like, but the battles are cool. The first half of the movie is about the plight of a group of thieves who unwittingly release Barugon from it's ""egg"". It grows at an alarming rate, wiping out all in it's path! Can Gamera stop this grumpy reptile in time? Watch and be astonished..."
2,"Nice for awhile, then started deteriorating","I've only had this table a few months and all around the edges of the top piece it is lifting, chipped, and the particle board is not holding up well. The top finish is wearing away a bit too. Other than that it is a cute table. It was easy to put together. If you won't really use this table, it's a cheap option- but if it actually will be a central part of your living room- look for something else."
1,It has never been received..........,I still think that Amazon is doing great job but I have never received that Katana even I have paid it in full!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great decorating ideas,"This book contains many pictures and gives great ideas for decorating. As of Feb 7, 1999, I don't know why Amazon says it is not published yet. I bought mine at Home Depot Expo."
3,"""explosion""","I have read about 11 bipolar memoirs in order to gain insight into the daily struggle. While it definitely added a few more pieces to the big picture,I found it more taxing to read than others due to the intensity and the way in which it is written. However, if you want to get inside someone's head, you have to be willing to go along for the ride."
4,Raw and Provocative,"""Mr. Feldman's social and religious satire throughout the book are highly invigorating. He brings up interesting and challenging issues that show a tremendous amount of intellectual depth."""
5,Lower the price,The book could be more cool if the price was low. I think about $50.00 dollars New. How about that. I'm not kidding. I want the book so bad.
1,Robomusic Gershwin,"This is lifeless robo-music, a replay of the piano rolls available elsewhere. For the real recordings of Gershwin playing Gershwin from the 20's and 30's, see ""Gershwin Playing Gershwin"" with Paul Whiteman and the Van Eps Quartet on the Naxos label, ASIN: B000053HK5, also partly available as an MP3 download elsewhere on amazon.com"
1,waste of time battery,this battery is a waste of time it dies in like 12 hours and i only received this battery 1 week now
5,Perfect!!,The mount was a perfect fit for the TV. It was simple to mount and easy to use. Love the tilt feature!! Will be buying this again as we add more flat screens.
2,Disappointed,"Beer Can Chicken is a great idea...taste great.This is my second rack...first one was from Fox Run[...]This rack from Bayou Classic is very dingy looking compared to the one from Fox Run.But the bigger disappointment is the size of the opening.I bought a stainless steel tumbler to replace the beer can.The openning in the Bayou Classic is just a hair more narrow which prevents the my stainless steel shaker from dropping thru to the bottom.They both will hold a can, and they both are made from identical scetches.But the fox run is better looking, better quality, and just a hair larger opening and maybe a dollar cheaper.I have oe of each (Fox Run, and Bayou Classic) and if I order more for gifts, it will be the one from Fox Run.""Winware Stainless Dredge 10 ounce"" is the stainless steel container that will fit into the fox run rack but will NOT fit into this rack.Winware 10-Ounce Stainless DredgeFox Run Beer Can Poultry Roaster"
5,Beercan Rack is great,This rack works so much better than trying to balance the chicken on the grill using just the can and the legs. Now someone has to figure out how to get the chicken off the can after it is cooked.
2,They're ok,They're decent shades Cheap plastic not for direct sunlight. however while driving they do ok. I wouldn't buy them again.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I really enjoyed reading about the various places and some events that the author visited throughout Japan but I felt that she spent most of her time criticizing different aspects of Japanese culture. It is understandable that certain things can be quite frustrating but I think if the author had brushed up on some things about Japanese culture before she arrived in Japan, some of the friction that occurred would have been lessened and she still could be herself while respecting the Japanese culture.All in all, I found her tagline ""A Year in Search of Wa"" to be quite misleading after reading this book."
3,.Little Disappointed,"The video is definitely used. It skips about 5 minutes of the dvd, which in a workout dvd is kind of a big section. I'm a little upset that it skips, I have to pause my workout just to sit and rewind up until the part it skipped.i knew the dvd was used, but i wish they would have written it in the description.The workout itself is great and the item shipped quickly"
4,In Dolphy's shadow,"While Eric Dolphy is heard on many recordings under his own name or as a sideman between the years 1960-1964 (when he died), Ken McIntyre is relatively an unknown name even to Jazz buffs.Hearing this CD indicates that Dolphy was a much more interesting soloist the McIntyre at the time. McItyre had an interesting intonation, but mostly he sounds very conservative. I have the feeling that he did not feel at ease with Parker's bop innovations, and was closer to pre-bop Jazz. This becomes very apparent when one hears Dolphy's solos - that show he absorbed Parker's style and took it one step further.It may be that McIntyre was a little awed by Dolphy's presence, but the result is that I find myself waiting for Dolphy's solos while McIntyre is playing.The rhythm section is good though a little too conservative for Dolphy.I recommand this CD for those who want to learn about McIntyre, but mostly for those who love Dolphy's wonderful playing."
3,Golden swallow,"I've purchase this DVD because I watched this film when I was about 12 years old in Vietnam. The DVD arrived in very good condition as they said and the quality is good. Except 1 or 2 missing scence in the film and the first 7 minutes of the film was dark (hardly seen at all & jumpy)...I don't know because of the DVD bad or they made it the way it is, otherwise if you knew and like the famous actors and actress in the movie (Wang Yu, Cheng Pei Pei, Lo Leih) like me then it's a good collection for your Chinese movie."
2,Nothing to write home about,It is nothing to write home about. Disappointed that the pressure is not better. Wouldn't buy it again
4,this band changed my life,"this was one of the first cds i ever bought on the advice of a friend along time ago. crass are often underrated, because while they were very minimalist punk, the things they were doing in their brief career draw from musique concrete and foreshadow industrial music. many of their LPs do have weak moments and are probably not neccessary to anyone besides hardcore fans, this is an album anyone interested in political music should own.""bloody revolution"" critiques punk extremists hungry for violent uprisings, the infamous ""do they owe..."" comments on governments which allow unemployment and homelessness to co-exist with upper classes, ""Smash the Mac"" attacks American dominance. Buy it for the liner-notes and lyrics alone!"
4,An edge-of-your-seat page-turner,"This first novel by Joyce is a well-written, character novel with just the right mixture of suspense and intellectualism. The characters were fully developed and very real...there were times when I started to believe I was part of the whole dreaming experiment. The novel pulled me in completely...so much so that I read it in one day. I enjoyed Joyce's spare style. He writes concisely with just enough flourish of detail to keep the pace changing in a satisfying way. The only part I was a bit disappointed with was the ending. I thought it came too quickly and I was left somewhat confused. I wasn't sure the meaning of the final event...why was Dreamside trying to claim them? And why was Dreamside satisfied with just one of them? Why not try for all? I am not sure I needed a complete explaination, but something that I could grab onto and play around with in my head. Despite it's minor flaw, the novel was an exciting and rewarding read."
3,Good enough...,"... It'll probably do, but I'll have to wait for the holidays to be the judge. I wanted it for goose, but there's a good chance the dimensions are wrong.Construction seems quite good and I'm sure it would perform as intended for a turkey, all in all, a good recommendation from me."
5,Delicious,"I am trying to eat snacks with more protein, and these fit the bill. Crunchy and more protein than the average chip. The cheddar flavor is pretty good!"
2,B&D does not even sell this anymore - does that say something?,"I went to use this to hang pictures on my wall this last weekend. If I still had the receipt I would return it. When the level bubble is at level, it basically shows the wall & ceiling in my house is CRAZY, ridiculously crooked (Which is just not possible)! It is even with the wall at one end and then literally angles down so that by the corner of the wall the line drops 3"". I misplaced my ""instruction booklet"" and went online to B&D to see if I could print another one - and they do not even make this model anymore! I just bought it 2-3 months ago - and not on a clearance table! I normally trust B&D, but this little device was a waste of $s."
2,Bloopers,"This tape is only for hardcore DS fans. No narrations involved to set up the bloopers. They didn't appear to have much of a budget, so when an actor blooped, they just kept on going. Some of the bloopers are really funny though. Like the tombstones in the graveyard. Every time someone brushed past them, they would wobble around. lol"
3,Laughs Lurk in the Darkness,"Best with an icy bottle of Grolsch, sausages, sauerkraut, and mustard. And leaves falling from trees in Autumn's deepening gloom. Enjoy the Bloopers slightly tipsy, like the cameras and the actors' lines, and you'll get the maximum value out of this DVD. The rest disappoints, but for fans of the Gothic Masterpiece, who appreciate the delightful sum of its many parts, this is a must-have."
4,FAQ style book,"If you are looking for a book which gives the basics in a question and answer format , this is the book for you . Provides an introduction to XML and related technologies . If you are a beginner , this might be worth trying . Also it might elucidate some of the ""why"" questions for advanced learners . But this is certainly not a ""How to"" Kind of book."
2,Car cover,A neighborhood cat was able to shred this cover to pieces within less than 24 hours. Thought the material would be more durable.
1,Bad Diamonds,"Worst diamonds I have ever seen in my life. Milky, with no shine or sparkle whatsoever."
1,MaryinNovi,"These earrings do not sparkle. They seem to be good quality, but they do not make a good presentation at all. The box is not fancy, the little velvet drawstring bag that came with them had a hole in bottom, and the color/clarity is horrible. I would not recommmend them."
3,jewelry,I am very pleased with the delivery and appearance of my product. I was impressed by the price and quality.
2,Hit or miss with low-priced diamonds,"With this inexpensive grade of diamonds, visible flaws can be very likely, as can off-colors. Combine that with cloudiness rather than the clearly refracting internal facets of a good diamond, and the stones are dull and lifeless.Unfortunately, the slightly larger size of 1/2cttw makes these flaws more apparent. The result is hit-or-miss depending on your particular stones. Mine was more miss than hit, so I returned them rather than giving the flawed earrings to my wife. I also got a pair of the 1/3 cttw diamonds (very similar and cheaper):14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/3 cttw, K-L Color, I3 Clarity). That pair worked very well and was bright and clear, as shown by shining a flashlight into the stones.Amazon's lenient return policy applies equally to jewelry, of course.For me at least, these 1/2 cttw earrings didn't work. Not recommended."
5,greaat earings for the price,"I had been wanting diamond earings that looked good, but if I lost one at the gym, it wouldn't be devastating. I had looked at local department stores, but the price was never below 250.00 so I ordered these and then looked at the reviews....so I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice they are. I am going to order a pair in yellow gold as well. Great value!"
4,Excellent workout!,"This is great mix of Yoga and Martial Arts workout. I very much like Cameron's down to earth style. The workout has clear and easy to follow instructions and is apt for the beginner-intermediate range. I like the flexibility of the 30, 40 or 50 minute lenght that can accomodate your schedule.The kit contains the above mentioned workouts, an eating guide mostly based on fruits and vegetables and which I particularly did not care for since I thought it very restrictive (extremely light breakfast progressing to a heavier meal). It also includes a 56 min. relaxation CD titled Self Empowerment with Cameron's soothing voice and music by Jonathan Wilson"
4,Aconcagua - You may as well buy it!,"I was pre-warned by the other reviews, so I didn't expect more. It's a one sided B&W folded sheet with simple maps and text, which adds to what I'm learning from the internet and other products I'm buying. If you're planning on climbing Aconcagua you'll want to buy every map or guide you can get, talk to everyone who's been there you can, and spend a lot of time researching the net. Is it pricey for what you get - yes. But if you're planning on going to Aconcagua this will be a small matter next to the few thousand you'll spend to get there!"
1,no documentation...just pure opinion,"This book has very poor research behind it. Plus there are negative quotes/phrases on the side margins that do not show any documentation to support itself. The author from the begining had the intention to say what he wanted to say, or whatever opinions he had. Why else would he write this book? I thought that this book was a complete waste because it was not accurate, but then again it was his attempt for those (who do not know much about Mormons) to have a way to respond when they encounter Mormons. I think that those who are approached my Mormons should be courteous and say, ""No thank you, goodbye."" Or ""So, what are you guys all about?"" All people should have the obligation to choose and analyze things on their own (and utlimately to pray to our Father in Heaven to verify its truth), rather than rely on the ignorance of others."
3,"Good for beginners, but pretty basic stuff.","This is a fine introductory text with clear photos of the exercises, but definitely aimed at those with no prior experience in geriatrics. It might be good as a reference to photocopy specific exercises for new restorative aides, but if you are a PT or PTA, I'd look elsewhere. Also, the font choices are often incongruous and distracting, particularly the headings for chapters."
1,horrible,"when i first heard of this band i had a thought that they would be nu-metal and not do anything to be good, and i was right,no one should buy this cd, if i could have i would have gave it no stars"
5,DAMN!,"The four letter word above was my first thought upon hearing this album. This is one great disc! They describe themselves as ""metalcore for the kids who listen to In Flames"", which is not too far off. I would call it emocore/melodic death/metalcore/punk metal.My favorites are At Least I Know I'm A Sinner. I can really identify with that song. If you like Soilwork, Shadows Fall, Avenged Sevenfold, AFI or From Autum To Ashes, this is for you."
5,"Dark Hardcore, very emotional","This cd is all around great, with not bad song on it. The guitar work is very good but sounds kind of old skool in some parts with some iron Maidenish solos. Drumming is really really good, bass you cant really hear in except one song "" someone's standing on my chest"" Singing is unbelievable, completely throaty and raspy, sounds really old skool. .... If you actually try to understand what he is saying, he is saying that christians who call him names and stuff he finds to be hypocrites and weak, not christianity being weak, but christians who have to call people names so that they can feel better. ...."
1,deserves this and less,Just a bunch of F****ts trying to be heavy and original hardcore/metalcore is for new waver posers who don't know real metal. Just take a look at the way they play the melodies are fruity as hell and the vocals omg **BWABWABWABWABWABAW EIIIIIIGHHHHHH BWABWABWABWA** this isn't metal this is emo
1,NOT a hardcore band,there should be some more references to knives and bloodsplatter on here. and bridge nine should have released it. then this album would rule!(in the eternal words of wayne and garth...)NOT!
2,All Bluster No Substance,"When it comes to playing the very loud sections of this score Tilson Thomas is in fine form but then so is virtually every other Mahler 6th recording. However there is more to the substance of this work than mere bombast. There are subtle and shifting musical currents on which this symphony moves and which are vital in making it work. That Tilson Thomas misses and plods through only to gain our attention at the next climax. We have sadly reached a point where people feel a ""like wow"" hifi expierence is the same thing as genuine musical substance. The catalogues are full of fine Mahler 6th's (either Bernsteins, Karajan, Barbirolli , Sinopoli, Segerstam, Szell or Thomas Sanderling to name a few)and one need not waste time here. The cd notes add a sense of distaste by over associating itself with the events of September 11. It is both unneccesary and ghoulish."
4,good for girls,"This Keyboard is of solid construction (but not to heavy). I purchased it for my girlfriend as the pink LED (box says purple) light makes her happy. I also own a Logitech G-15 gaming keyboard. I like my board better because blue LED is good for me (though the red on the saitek is VERY cool), but thetrue reason I give the Saitek only 4 stars was the lack of a USB hub in the back of the Keyboard. USB hubs(replicators)are extremely small and would require only the same plug for both USB keyboard, Mouse, and other peripheral (e.g. USB headset). Saitek is doing a good job with this keyboard. Bang for back-lit keyboard buck the Saitek Eclipse II is worth itnow, and probably even more when they add USB ports to it."
1,Locked up my system,"A friend of mine had gotten an Eclipse I keyboard and was raving about it, so I tried hers for a couple of hours, liked it, and ordered the Eclipse II. It was great the first couple of days, then it was freezing my system continuously soon afterward. I thought I'd see if it was my system, or the new keyboard causing the issue so I connected my old trusty keyboard back up again. Immediate improvement and the system hasn't locked up since I disconnected the Eclipse II. I love the concept, loved the backlit keyboard, but the product is faulty, unfortunately. I will buy another backlit keyboard, but it will not be a Saitek."
4,SAitek Eclipse 2 light up keyboard,"Great keyboard, i've had it for about 4 months now, with no problems.I don't like the fact that it changes colors whenever I switch systems using my KVM switch, but other than that, it's a great keyboard!"
5,love this keyboard,"i love that this keyboard comes in three different kinds of color and the brightness can be adjusted as well, typing on it feels nice and the hand rest is soothing on my wrists. great product"
1,Poor durability,"Works good at first, neat lights and all that. But after three or four months of use, keys just stop responding and the paint on the top of the keys flakes off. I went through three of these in one year before I decided to not buy more and changed to Logitech products."
3,"OK, but not for me","Well, it's an OK keyboard, but the color wasn't as bright as I thought, plus the space bar on my unit didnt work. I ended up returning it for a refund."
2,Choose Another,Keyboard lighting not bright enough to show through the letters unless very dark in the room. Two of the keys already failing after a few months. Not worth the money...choose another brand.
5,Love it!,"My husband actually ordered this keyboard for me because he has the older model and I was jealous. This one is so much better. I love being able to choose the backlit color. This may sound silly but I also love the clicky sound the keys make when you type. The buttons aren't too sensitive either, like other keyboards I have had.Overall I am very satisfied."
5,Yes! Perfect,"The lighting for my home office area is very poor. I've tried a couple of desk lamps, but they are either too far away to be effective or they are right in the middle of my limited workspace. This keyboard is the perfect solution! There is plenty of backlighting for me to easily see the keys (especially when trying to find numbers, symbols, etc), and the keys feel great! Easily as good or better than my Dell Keyboard."
4,nice board,"this keyboard is awesome. with the different color displays and the brightness control nob, it makes it nice to use in the dark. the keys them self have a griped texture to them, so they do not feel like cheap plastic. over all it is a great keyboard."
1,Great idea that doesn't work,"I had high hopes for this because the family PC is in the same room as the tv and it would be nice to be able to use the keyboard in the dark. However, after only 2 weeks of light use the several keys and the spacebar just stopped working. I did a search online and apparently this is a common problem. I did not try a second one given the history. I'll wait until one of the major manufacturers comes out with a similar product."
2,wish I could see what I'm typing!,"count me in with all those guys who think this is a fantastically made, mechanically durable unit with just the right touch and it's well laid out- and the paint starts wearing off in a few months. I'm on my second one in about 3-4 years. and currently 19 (NINETEEN! would you believe?) keys are unidentifiable. I've been getting by simply because of being able to ID their neighbors, but it's getting a bit tiresome now.My options are a new KBD (not another of these) OR I have considered buying a steel alphabet & number stamping kit in the 1/4"" size (around $30)and heating them and making an impression in the keys. Unfortunately this leaves some guessing on the punctuation, so...I'm going to go low and give this product 2 stars, Saitek should have addressed this long ago, surely they realize this is a problem."
2,These don't hold up,"I bought two of these and both have the same problems. The keys stick and don't work after a while and the finish wears off the key themselves. When I called Saitek and asked for some consideration, they basically told me I was on my own. For a premium product, this is unacceptable. Buy a different keyboard!"
1,Plastic,"My daughter loved this flashlight. Especially to let children use and play with because it recharges. PROBLEM: A small Plastic gear(3/16"") broke 2 treads rendering the whole flashlight useless. You would think an engineer would know where the weakest link is and spend $.01 more on that part for a better product."
1,Not Made Like They Used To,I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this KitchenAid mixer. They used to be considered top of the line but I don't believe they're made for the long haul. I bought mine knowing it would be handed down to my kids but now it sits collecting dust while I figure out if it's worth repairing. I was able to get a few good years out of it but then the motor began straining under the pressure of a double batch of cookie dough and there is a definite burning smell emitting from the top. The lift no longer glides up and down but drops with a thump and the paddle seems to be hitting the bowl in one area. I have tried adjusting the screw to no avail. The finish held up remarkably well so that's a plus but the mass manufacturing of KA will be their downfall. I can not recommend KA Pro mixers if you want a quality product for years to come. It has been a huge failure!
2,"Financial Insight, Literary Morass","There's nothing wrong Soros's ideas, this much is obvious given his stunning investment record. He fancies himself the investment/philosopher king, though, and is incapable of expressing himself clearly. He suffers that post grad mentality that suggests the heavier the diction, the more profound the insight. For investment professionals willing to put up with this, the book is worth a read. For the average investor, however, this book is a waste of time."
2,You won't lear how to make one million dolars here...!,"The language is very, very heavy, sometimes you don't even know what Soros is talking about. The predictions he made proved wrong in their great majority. It seems the books is the product of a sick mind."
1,"Soros, the great financier but lousy economist.",A very detailed and interesting recollection of Soros'finance strategy. But at the end of the book I am left with the feeling that the reason why he asks for so much regulation is because it is easier to forecast and influence the regulator than the market. I would trust him with my money but not with a classroom of economics students.
3,"looks good, sounds... not so much.","After taking weeks to decide which fan to buy going by aesthetics, it didn't occur to me I was overlooking something equally important. Noise. Maybe I should have bought a different westinghouse fan with the ""Whisper quiet, high performance 153-mm by 17-mm motor"" as another fan is advertised.Everything Matt OK said was true for me. Easy to install... etc.I have mine installed in a newly renovated house, with brand new electrical. The ceiling fan box was wired specifically for this, 2 circuits to connect the fan and light on wall switches with dimming. The thing works fine in every respect except, this loud humming from the motor at every speed. With noise and activity going, you can't really hear it. When its quiet, the fan is the loudest thing in the house, literally hearing it in an adjacent room.I might have to start again."
2,Not a good fan at all,I have to agree with alot of these reviews. This fan looks good but it does now flow enough air and the motor is really loud. Also the directions to assumable the fan where not very good. I am shipping this fan back today.
4,"Decent CD, but not what I expected","I got this cd as a free promotion from HM magazine, so I was expecting at least a really good disc, because HM rocks (but then again, it *was* free). The instrumentalism is okay, but the vocals are pretty weak. I'm not sure if this is due to a production problem or what, but the guy's voice sounds cheezy and it wavers a little bit. The instrumentation is okay, and the melodic moments are really cool, but when they get heavy, it's monotonous. The songs seem to be drawn out and to drone on and on. They come across as an imitation Living Sacrifice, just not as fast. The cd isn't that bad though, and the soft melodic moments are a nice touch. My personal favorite track is ""Fear is the Enemy."""
5,It's a great gift,"It's a gift for my niece, she used to love this as a girl I'm sure i can't wait to see her face once she gets it Xmas day"
5,Sets the stage for North American researchers of their UK roots,"The best part of this short readable book is that Ms. Irvine takes the perspective of the North American. The records are remote for us, so how can efficient research be done? By providing a broad view, the answer is provided as well as the setting of reasonable expectations. Since 1993 much more is available on-line. The basics and good advice on strategies are still sound."
5,"With an angry thought, the 21st century has been thrown into a new Dark Age.",This is book 7 in the Marvel/Epic Comics colorized graphic novel collections.
5,Good read.,"Very helpful to read this book, as a pastor or a layman. Peterson generally writes to a pastoral audience but this book is valuable to all."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought one of these for my 5 year old, so she could have a little boom box of her own. She had it a week before it just stopped working. I exchanged it for another. The same night, while int he kitchen with us, it stopped working. Don't buy one of these!"
4,travel dryer,I love the dryer it is very lightweight and easy to travel with. Plan to buy another one for a friend.
5,Broken Bridges,We had seen this movie on television and enjoyed it. We wanted a copy for ourselves to share with family and friends. It arrived in great condition.
2,Toby Keith,"Pretty good first movie, got free tickets to see it or else i probaly would have waited to see it on dvd. The soundtrack is very good but the acting not so much. except for the girl in this movie she was amazing,great voice and she has a future in music and movies,if she wants it."
5,Broken Bridges Excellent Movie,"Broken Bridges (Includes VIP Access Bonus Dvd) (Widescreen)I Love This Movie, Only Took Two Years to Receive as a Gift from My Wonderful Hubby, Thanks Honey, (Kids Couldn't Buy for Me, I Guess it's Because I Have Expensive Taste!). Broken Bridges is a Romantic and you have to have a ""HEART, SENSITIVE, GOOD CRY, BE ALONE (or Silence)"" to really enjoy this movie. I have watched several times now and I enjoy the movie each & every time."
2,"Works, but is expensive","I will be taking mine apart tomorrow to publish the wiring diagram. over 60 bucks for a 3 switch pedal and a very short cord? Meh. It works fine, clicks when depressed, but otherwise really disappointed that these dont come w/ the expensive amps as standard.I will post a link for the DIY enthusiast to save some significant money!"
5,happy duet,"I have had this album in my (more or less) Complete Works of Stan Getz for more than a decade but it hadn't occupied a postion of prominence. But I went back the other day and relistened and I really like it!There are less of Getz wonderful ballads than one often finds in this period but the music is spirited and happy and Getz does a great job of call-and-response to passages Tjader plays first on vibes, for example ""Ginza Samba"". Sounds bounce back and forth from vibes to sax and back again! What a happy, optimistic period this was in music.Fun and high energy from beginning to end. Melodic, relaxed and swinging! Should be more popular. Quite fifties Latin music - Seems to presage Getz Bossa Nova albums, in a vague sense.Well recorded, for it's period.(NOt that it's anyone's business, but I bought this CD before Amazon existed)"
3,"Good presentation of some theories, though hard to follow","I am a novice to astrophysics, but do hold a BSc. in biology. This book, though claiming to be introductory was extremely difficult to follow. I had to read and reread and reread to follow many concepts. This is likely due to the material and no fault of the author. To his credit, when I understood a concept, I REALLY understood it, and felt smugly to myself that I had a better understanding of the universe. This is not a leisure read, pick it up when you really want to know about the origin of the universe."
4,Super Video!,"We purchased this because my some of 18 months was biting at home and at school. His biting was not done out of anger, but of excitement. Since watching this video his biting slowed and then stopped. He is now 22 months and I catch him every now and then singing the theme song. Yesterday, a cat bit him and he told the cat,""No! Don't bite. No, no. Don't bite."""
5,Inspirational,Fisher opens up his investment philosophy after over 50 years of investing. Three books for the price of one-=- a true bargain. Now if we can only practise what we learn without repeating his mistakes. J
2,Another Source for Letter Forms,"If you're trying to learn Copperplate calligraphy, I don't recommend this as your first book. Instead, Eleanor Winters' Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy is a much better tool for self-study. However, once you master the material in Winters' book, you might find the Technique of Copperplate Calligraphy to be a good source for additional examples of letter forms, especially capitals."
2,scratches easily,"this case is clear and plastic, so it shows off your phone's back nicely. that is, until you use it for a few days, because it becomes scratched very easily. moreover, because it's clear, dirt and dust that gets trapped between the phone and the case can be seen, which is unsightly.finally, boxwave is very slow at responding to queries."
1,FELL APART EVEN WITH OCCASIONAL USUAGE,This bag is larger so we used it occasionally for longer trips. It fell apart really fast and the zippers (both sides) broke in less than 25 times of using. I returned it and ironically there was another lady returning the same bag because it fell apart on her.I really love my clamshell diaper bag by another manufacturer!
3,"Gift, so I didn't read it","My brother-in-law is looking to go to Russia and had requested this book. According to buying it on abroad websites, I got it really cheap here on Amazon. It was twice the price in England! He seems happy with this book as a gift, so I would say if you're interested, buy it."
4,Give it a try!,I dont want to go into to much details about the storyline. I will say this... I really enjoyed this book. It was like reading someone's diary. I felt like I could relate to what was going on throughout the book.Any fan of chick lit will benefit from reading this laugh out loud book.
1,cracked plastic hub,"I was a bit surprised that some assembly was required, but that wasn't a big deal. Not too difficult to do. However, the center hub for all three lower links of the legs was made from plastic. It arrived cracked and I noticed that only after I spent time fully assembled the whole thing. Had to disassemble and send it back to Amazon. Amazon was great and took it back without questions. I was expecting a rugged outdoor work light, but was very surprised by the plastic hub that arrived cracked. I would not recommend this."
2,"Built cheap, bad bulbs.","These put out a lot of light when they are working. But, they are very built very light. After a little use the stand won't stay up and the lights won't stay aimed where you want them. Also, these halogen bulbs run extremely hot, burn out easily and have poor contacts where they attach at the end of the bulb."
1,Super Cyclone?!?,Installed this item and was hardly impressed by the amount of air if moves. Super Cyclone? A kid blowing-out birthday cake candles makes more wind than this item does. I have mine turned on high and it barely moves any air at all. I haven't even bothered to check the temperature on my video card as I'm sure the installation of this exhaust fan couldn't have had any effect on anything in my case. Don't waste your money. I really expected much more from this product due to the fact that it took up 2 slots.
5,Good fan,"This is a good blower/fan. Moves air and lots of it. It is large and a tight fit against the PCI card slots on the motherboard but it moves air. My main problem now its that there is almost too little ventilation openings in the front of the computer case. Also, it doesn't work well with PCI express graphics cards. In a micro ATX motherboard, large PCI graphics cards take up 2 slots and are usually the top two slots (closest to the CPU). This would then fit under the PCI graphics card. I have an ASUS GTX 460 in such a setup. The clearance between the two was about 2 millimeters and worse yet the two fans take air in from the same side (top for the fan and bottom for the graphics card) thus they compete against each other. My graphics card actually had a temperature increase of 5 Celsius. I move the fan to a different computer and decided to upgrade my gaming computers case instead. In that other computer it is moving lots of air and helping to reduce the overall temps in the case."
2,Not that good....,Usually I love movies like this & I didn't even finish it as I couldn't....The story just didn't click for some reason.I would save your $ for something else.
3,Statistics text for people who understand statistics,"Kuehl covers a lot of statistical designs, and provides great examples and practice problems. However, the book is not ""user friendly"" even for student who have had several semesters coursework in regression analysis. Also, the author tends to change his notation from chapter to chapter without telling the reader, thus creating great confusion. For example ""r"" or ""k"" could signify replicate. Some sections are poorly organized."
1,disappointment,"I'm not a good choice for you to ask me to review this item as I had to return it for a refund because in a Sandman match when he gets mugged by about 3 other guys, the DVD cuts off & I never found out the ending of the match. I retried the disc but it obstinately refused to finish that match. I did enjoy the other ECW doco, Rise & fall of, so will have to replay that or watch one of my 27 other ECW DVD's."
5,Almost better then the original!!!,"It is an absolute treat to go see HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED live. And I was curious to see,,,,, er,,,, hear what they would do on CD. Well, it's really interesting. They perform the cream of Dylan, with total energy, and enthusiasm. It's as if Bob was actually hungry, and giving his all.Thank you, Joel, for a fantastic cd.For the Dylan completist, and the average Dylan fan."
5,Very good.,"Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan. That being said: Joel Gilbert is a great listen. He is (I think) very passionate about what he does. He also directed Documetaries about Dylan (2 that I know of) Check them out: Home Movies Dylan Tour 1966 and Dylan Tours 1966-1974 Through the Camera of Berry Feinstein. He also has another CD of Dylan songs called ""Masters of Dylan."" He's not Bob but he is very good. Check out www.highway61revisited.com for a great web site."
2,Disappointing,"Korda takes a potentially fascinating topic-an analysis of American bestseller lists in the 20th century-and gets in the way of his subject. He's desperate to remind readers of his own long-forgotten books and otherwise allows his prejudices to intrude far too much in the discussion. A more analytical, thoughtful and less subjective and breezy approach would have made for a much better book resulting in a four or five-star rating, rather than just two."
4,Happy Owner,"Since owning the Polaroid PDC6400cf I have made many photos of different situations inside and outside.My landscape results have been most satisifing.Interrior shots have been satisifing with lighting of interior lights.Flash photos have been ok,but not the best.Ease of operation most satisifing.Battery life without using the monitor held up well.Thanks Poladoid for my beginners digital camera.Harry S.Adams"
2,Is that my cat?,"I bought this camera to experiment with digital cameras, but I have found that this camera takes pictures that are so fuzzy, I avoid using it. The pictures only look good if you view them as little, tiny thumbnails.Additionally, setting up the software that comes with this camera takes a bunch of additional work with Windows XP. You have to download special drivers and instructions from the Polaroid web page, and then you have to tell Windows to install them even though Windows tells you that this could permanently mess up your XP installation. Luckily, my computer still works.This camera might be worth the money if only to convince you that you should spend alot more money on a better camera."
1,Was Natalia Elmanova a BorCon'99 speaker ?!,If yes -> DO NOT BUY this book.. I saw her presentations on Delphi Midas - dear god!.. it was sooo baaad!!!
3,REAL GORY!! REALLY TWISTED MOVIE!!,"This movie was SICK!!! It's like ""Faces of Death"", showing real death scenes, accidents, suicides, murder, and a really gross and very unusual autopsy part where they flayed open some dead guy's back-to get to his spinal cord. I quit watching when it got to that...Oh my god!! It is very chilling, and will definately make you sqirm!! SICK, YUK, SICK!!!!The sound was bad though on the DVD, when the people are narrarating the scenes-it's not very clear audibly-even on DVD. (Which I found kind of annoying, because you want to know what's going on exactly). And you expect great sound and picture quality on a DVD. I can understand, some of the footage was older, and some is home video-so some of the picture quality is not that great. But some scenes were also new and decent. Sooo if you have a morbid curiosity, I would say it's worth seeing for yourself. I know I'll have a hard time trying to sleep tonight!! YUK!!!"
3,By the Numbers Spanish Music,"A good but all things considered unexceptional offering. The much-hyped ""originality"" of the group fails to materialize on this same-old same-old album. If you really love Spanish guitar music then add this album to your collection, though be warned that you will wince hearing the hip-hop added to some songs. But if you ignore, as you should, those tracks, you have a perfectly serviceable background noise album. Alas, except for Flamenco fans, there isn't much to recommend it to anyone. The Techari Remixes CD is better and shows some interesting originality."
5,love it,"My 18 month old daughter loves these books. We have two of them and she's so cute with them that I want to get her a bunch more. They have pictures of real life items, colors, shapes etc. The pictures are very vibrant, clear and straightforward. Some of the things make me wonder (guinea pig? why not hamster?) but overall they are great. She loves to sit with me and we point at different things and I tell her what they are, or ask her where X is and she will point it out to me. She has had at least one of these books since she was a baby, I got one for my shower, and she has always loved it."
2,not so great,this is just a few scenes of police turning-over rotted bodies and mishandling crime-scene evidence. it's replayed at half speed and the high-point of this video is viewing a body that was apparently melted with chemicals. i always find it helpful when these kinds of films are accompanied by narration but this video doesn't give any backround information about the victims.
4,The best implementation so far,"If you check out these types of devices, namely the networked media streamers, it seems that everyone pretty much loves the idea but a common thread throughout is that the implementation isn't there yet.That's not the case with this unit.This one gets it right. I am currently streaming music, photos and video as well as surfing the web on my PC-P3LWG/DVD. Setup was a snap (although I'm not running a wireless network) and software installation was a breeze.There are some caveats though. WMVHD files will play but there's no audio. The unit will detect my Rhapsody service and show me what's there but won't play it.Buffalo has some firmware updates in the works which will address a number of issues. The fact that it has a built in DVD player is icing on the cake."
4,"Mostly for the boys, but. . .","I bought this book as a gesture of goodwill betweeen my partner and I. I am a girl, and although I can get quite hot while reading these stories with him, the ones about incessent blowjobs and stuff get a little old.Overall, I do enjoy the book and I think that it can spice up anybody's nighttime reading.P. S. The ""Girls on Girls"" section is particularly exciting. : )"
5,Pure Magic,"This is a book that you will want to give as a gift to someone you really like, or love. Sahara Sunday Spain, (If you can believe that name), is a divine child who has expressed herself eloquently in writing and illustrations with her simple straight foreword point of view. Her poems are a balm to the soul, her black and white drawings are exquisite. Every time I open this book I am delighted! I am always giving it away, and don't want to be without it in my library."
5,"Excellent compost container, great price!","I purchased this at least 6 months ago and it is perfect for sink side composting! Lid snaps shut and it cleans easily with a multi-purpose cleaner. Good thick plastic, and even better...MADE IN THE USA! Purchased two more for gifts!"
4,memories....,"wow--i never thought i'd find all these oldies on one cd--all originals, and what a great price! i had all these tunes--except that last one--on old scratchy albums, that were distributed by K-TEL in canada back in the late sixties....the only 1910 fruitgum co. tune that's missing is INDIAN GIVER, i think... for some strange reason, i've felt compelled recently to try to collect all those old tunes on cd, and with this purchase, i knocked quite a few off my list...these definitely are GROOVY tunes... i won't use my real name--i'm 42 and i'm buying bubblegum music! and....LOVING IT!"
5,killer set,i was very happy that this set came out for only $9.99 i save a lot of money and all of them in Blu say
4,Know what you want!,"Before you buy any poker chips, you really have to know what you want. I decided on clay composite because it most closely resembles casino chips and doesn't wear. These chips are nice, and will definitely last forever without dents or wearing, but they sound kinda funny to me. They sound like metal, even though they aren't. The clay composite is just hard enough to give it the clinking sound. Otherwise, it's HUGE. Much larger than you'd think. And very heavy. The shipping is as much as the set."
3,War poetry at it's best,"In on likelyhood no war has produced as many great poets as the First World war. Siegfried Sasson, Owens and countless others to name only few. Hemingway also started out as a writer, T.S. Elliot was profoundly inspired by it and the list goes on. This book gives a good overview over the poetry that was written mostly by the soldiers who were at the front. The collection is quite good but in my opinion could have been better expecially by having fewer poems and raising the standard of the poems put in the book."
1,Just dreadful,"Ghastly movie. Dreadful acting, plot so bad it's funny, and how on earth did such a collection of dimwits get jobs in the world's most advanced nuclear facility? They'd have a hard time getting office desk jobs. I'm glad I only paid $2 for it. It's going into the garbage where it belongs. The ONE thing that was of mild interest was seeing Erin Gray and Gil on screen together so long after Buck Rogers."
5,Nice product..,I haven't used these yet because I haven't had time but I am sure this is a good product..I can't wait for the holidays to be over so I can enjoy..
5,happy husband,"I purchased this cd for my husband and that's all he plays in the car, it is the best thing i've bought that keeps him quiet while driving."
1,DON'T ORDER THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO END UP FRUSTRATED,"I had ordered this product on July 2 and on July 5 I recieved an e-mail saying that the item had been shipped. The email said it should arrive between July 6-July 12. On July 20 when it hadn't arrived I contacted Amazon and they told me to send an email to shoplet. After four more days of waiting I recieved an email from shoplet saying the product had been discontinued. I then called shoplet to ask why I had recieved the email on the fifth. I told Jason, the customer service representative what happened and then he hung up on me. I finally after 2 weeks of waiting I got my money back but not after weeks of frustration and I never got the fly fan. DON'T ORDER THIS PRODUCT"
3,Inferior To Previous Product by Bostitch,This product is now made in China and I find it inferior to the same product from Bostitch that was previously made in USA.
1,Stay Away,This was an awful awful movie. There was a reson it took so long for this title to reach North America. Because it sucks. The story makes absolutly no sense and the acting is terrible. I can't tell you about the special features because there aren't any which made it suck even worse. I wish I could give the piece of (...)0 stars. Be warned Stay Away.
3,Good Southern Gospel,"The title of this DVD is misleading. I bought it hoping for worship only to find that it is actually Southern Gospel. It is good, but not what the title tells you."
5,Quietest kitchen fan yet,"We have renovated several houses and have always installed Panasonic vent fans. They are among the quietest and most durable available (Fantech is also good). This is the first inline fan we have installed. We put it in the kitchen-- we don't need a fancy hood with fan over the stove, just a good exhaust fan to clear the occasional smoke or to cool the room. This fan moves lots of air (240 cfm), especially with the 6"" duct we installed, but it is quieter than the 70 cfm ceiling fans we have put in previously."
5,great review!!!,"i love the album and how i got it. great package and it came quickly. great condition, amazing! cant stop listening to the songs."
2,Defective,Received the item- hooked and tested for leaks- no issue. went to use at a tailgate- 30 minutes into use- the propane began blowing out of the crimp connection- caused a fire that was quickly extinguished. Melted the line making it unusable
5,FABULOUS STORY IF U LOVE GOD,"I rented this DVD movie over a year ago of the Tabernacle, and I was so 'fascinated and filled' withthe story and details that I had to see it again.So I ordered it for my DVD Christian collection of documentaries and movies.It is a treasured DVD. If you want to learn more about God and what happened in the time of oldand before Jesus, when God was doing all the things on earth in talking to the men of God,then you need to really buy this DVD. You will not regret it.I LOVE IT."
4,Pretty good overview,This is a good (but short) overview of the tabernacle. Will be using it for young kids to give them visuals on what the Scripture is describing as we study the Tabernacle.
5,Solid work,"There can be few books on Romans comparable to this. Each time I read it, I get blessed. Newell provides tremendous insight into the book of Romans. He has an excellent understanding of what happened at the cross, the substitutionary work and the new resurrection life.For a foundational knowledge of the new life, of righteouness, Romans must be understood thoroughly. Don't miss this book!!"
2,"Re-make this, please.","A very disappointing Audrey Hepburn offering. Married to Mel Ferrer(director)who was still captivated by her beauty at the time, Audrey probably nixed filming on-location, which doomed this turn-of-the-century yarn from realizing its potential. The doe, Audrey,Tony Perkins and a fake snake could not liven the stagey jungle drama. State-of-the-art effects, on-location filming with Keira Knightley in the lead,perhaps, would bring this charming yarn to fruition. The W.H. Hudson book still charms."
2,A flop!,"I am one of Audrey's greatest fans, but this film was really bad. Any real critic will tell you so. It was directed by her then husband Mel Ferrer and eventually contributed to the break up of their marriage. It is too bad, not even the charm of Audrey as Rima, the wood spirit could save this doomed picture from box-office failure and it even damaged her career considerably. I hate to be so harsh, but it is the truth. I would only recommend this movie to you if you love the story or simply think that Audrey is worth watching through this poorly scripted and directed movie. I gave this two stars because some of the photography was nice and of course allowances must be made to Miss Hepburn."
3,Only for the dedicated Audrey fan,"This film won't hold the interest of many viewers unless you are dedicated Audrey Hepburn fans. The pace is slow, the characters are rather unconvincing, and the entire plot is a little stiff. On a more positive note, Audrey is charming and beautiful as the mysterious bird girl, and the cinematography is breathtaking. The scenes with the natives are pretty good, and the tribal dance scenes are effectively disturbing. Anthony Hopkins is cute, but there wasn't much of a spark onscreen between his character and Audrey's, which made the love story a bit unconvincing. Overall, worth a look at least once if you love Audrey Hepburn or want to see the film adaption of the novel."
1,i have two others that worked great but not this one,"this bottle is hot to the touch after filling it with hot tea. i have two other ones of this make, but got it from another place that no longer carries it. those worked beautifully. held hot liquid hot for more than 12 hours (well, it might have lost some heat, but not all!)however, this one lost heat with in the hour. i am not happy. i am going to try thermos or stanley thermos' next. they supposedly keep hot liquids hotter longer and cool cooler. plus stanley lets you replace worn out parts.ps. i use my working 2 every day twice a day and have been for more than 3 years. this past week i noticed it has started to leak. the plastic has finally started to wear down in the twist plug. :-( so i am going to definitely look into the other types of thermos'. these were great, just not reliable from one to the next."
4,Nice crate mat,"Nice quality mat. Not too thick but enough cushion for sleeping comfort. Fits perfectly in my 30"" crate and my Yorkie seems to enjoy sleeping on it."
1,Does not fit phone,"I purchased this product and was excited when it came it because it was a solution to my wire clutter problem on my desk. The best part about the product to me was being able to see the information on my phone while it was charing, and also to be able to charge an additional battery for my phone.The extra battery that was provided worked fine and charged on the dock.The major problem with this product is the phone didn't fit on the dock. The USB port the phone is supposed to sit on was pushed too far back in the cradle. It was too close to the back wall.I checked all of the literature that came in the packaging and it is all labeled 8125, so I am sure this is the real product.If they want to sell a product but haven't checked to see if it even works in the first place, I will not buy another item from bargincell.Don't buy this product unless you want less hair on your head, or you are a masochist."
3,Euro Fiction Requires Narcotics,"I had a hard time determining the number of stars to give this one. I'd give five stars for some chapters and one star for others. The sexual episodes described are well done and there is some genuinely original comedy, but I sensed that some of the humor was lost in translation. Still, the thin story line kept me reading to solve the mystery. This book won't make it big in the States because the author is far too casual about the ""hero's"" use of narcotics. The book could've retained all the substance and humor, been kept under 200 pages, and would've sold far more copies and received far more reviews. The author is brilliant, but twisted. And I love the cover design as it actually prompted me to pick up the book. I would like to meet the model for that little piece of art and would consider purchasing a framable copy."
1,IS THIS BOOK SOME KIND OF JOKE,"This guy lost me as an audience on page 8. At age 14, his parents gave him a notorized letter saying that he wasn't a runaway, let him drop out of school and gave him and his surf board a ride to the freeway so he could hitchhike from Texas to California? Come on! Then he claims he was walking thru El Paso Texas on a sidewalk (yeah, right! - carrying a surfboard?!?!) and three cowboys stood in his way lined up across the sidewalk and stood blocking his way with their thumbs in their belts. COME ON!!!! I lived in El Paso for YEARS and never saw cowboys. Just so you know - in case you don't read this book - he got away from the supposed cowboys by barking. Yep, you read that right,he BARKED - like a dog - and the cowboys got out of his way.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Lacuna Coil doesnt have anything on Sirenia! (4.3 stars),"This album is very enjoyable and relaxing with some good heavier part thrown in. Which is how good Gothic Metal should sound. Not like the processed commercial sound that pathetic excuse for a Gothic Metal band Lacuna Coil has.This album is exactly what you would be looking for in a Gothic Metal band. Good, growly Black Metal vocals coming from a male, and a sweet symphonic angels voice coming from a beautiful female singer, along with some good guitar riffs and cool yet relaxing electronic, keyboard, and piano sounds. Theres even some violin play in the songs!!!The only thing bothering me about this album is the structure of all the songs go in the same pattern. Growly vocals, then clear. Or growly, clear, growly, clear. The songs become predictable in that vocal sense. But in every other aspect this album is a fine example of todays Gothic Metal. I strongly reccommend it.Suck it up Lacuna Coil. You lose."
4,Great product!,"Received it sooner than the promised date, and am very happy about it. Not as nice as some wood ones, but perfect for a beginner!"
1,Woefully inadequate both as an introductory text and reference,"This book has few merits. No pun intended.It has a good introductory section on the symptoms of neurological conditions.However, it fails to provide the reader with an approach to diagnosis which is a pitfall for most clerks, interns and neurology and internal medicine residents.Remember always ask yourself WHERE is lesion ( brain spinal cord nerve NM junction or muscle ) and WHAT is lesion ( pathological process with respective differential diagnosis ).This book fails to do this which is inconceivable.As a reference it falls on more than occasion. The sections are incomplete and not comprehensive.There is little on entrapment neuropathy or spinal root problems.I do NOT recommend this text to any medical students ( get lindsay/bone/callender text on neurology and neurosurgery ).Neurology and medical residents should get a subscription to medlink neurology and not waste their time or money on the text."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"There's been one good attempt at a cute movie robot that I can think of, and that one doesn't talk, and gets strapped into the back of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing quite a bit, too.Here we have a mission to find out what went wrong with a spaceship - the answer basically boiling down to a very bad man, and a black hole.The investigating crew gets caught up in these problems, and it isn't the best idea to have problems next to a black hole.Slightly dodgy ending, too."
3,Practical and informative,After I stopped (actually skipped past) reading the evolution nonsense it because informative and helpful. We have a mixed house of blood types and this was helpful trying to find meals on neutral ground. I have recommended it to others with caution on evolution propaganda message.
4,Cook right recipe book,Good recipe book for anyone trying to eat right for their blood type. This book was for type A blood group and made it easier to stick to the recommended foods. Easy to read and work from.
4,Cook Right For Your Type,I felt the cook book is an excellent companion for living the blood type way of eating. I would reccomend this to everyone eating this way to give yourself more variety.
3,Another cook book,"If you want to follow ""Eat Right 4 your Blood Type"" this book offers appropriate recipes and could actually be used to better understand some of the concepts presented in ""Eat Right..."""
1,A Complete Crock,"This book is a total farce. Maybe it has helped some people, but it didn't work for me at all. After taking two blood tests to make sure I was a type A, I tried his recommendations despite my reservations. Dr. D'Adamo says type A's should be mainly vegetarian and eat high carbo/low fat. This type of diet has never worked for me at all. I even joined the blood type email list and followed the suggestion of others who informed me that there are ""several types of A's"" and one type needs more chicken and fish . After a few days on this diet, I felt like I was going to pass out and I wanted to punch someone else out. I was irritable, crabby, weird, shaky, nervous and weak. This is one of the worst diets I've ever tried, it may have helped some but I suspect their improvement is due to eating better foods in general and getting more exercise. Ironically, I am now doing well on a high protein diet, so why am I not type O?????"
3,Book is interesting,The concept of this book requires a nearly entire revamp of the foods a person eats. Very few of our staple foods were actually on the list. When looking for a good diet plan it's important to choose one that seems attainable. This one does not.
1,A good item if you do not leave it outdoor,"I first bought a Bayou Classic Stainless Steel Fryer to replace my old one. After finding out the burner is still a non-rust proof cast iron with poor manufacturing quality, I returned it.Instead, I bought this one to replace the rusty burner on my old fryer.It works great. I still can not leave it outdoor. Just remember to store it in a dryer place. Otherwise, it serves me well."
3,western movies fan,"dvd is in good condition and got it in stated time, I enjoy western movies, some I see now others I see later,I enjoy all western movies, thanks amazon."
5,Excellent! Had me reading until 2 in the morning!,"An excellent book. The characters are well developed and the action is non-stop. Reads just like any of Paul Levine's other books, which are worth picking up after you've read this. Definately get this book!"
2,You Decide....,"This is a good CD if you like instrumental music. If you want this just because of the title, don't bother to get it. The first 7 songs are from ""The Wizard of Oz"" (no singing), but the last five have nothing to do with the title, and personally, I've never even heard of them until I listened to this CD. This would be a good CD if you are a band/jazz band director and wanted to do songs on this CD, because you could hear what the songs were supposed to sound like, but like I said before, don't order it because of the title."
5,Dr. Bill,This is an excellent teaching tool for my psychology courses to show examples of how what you see is not always what is real. I highly suguest others view this segment as well.
4,Hammock review,"Should have been informed that the hammock stretches quite a bit. At first I thought I would have to return it, but after four adjusments it is fine. Not as comfortable as fabric but far more durable. I like it now."
5,Great:),"Netocracy is a great book, I recommend this for everyone. The book is about the new elite. Brand new thinking, unique ideas."
1,French only,Could not get it to play in English even though English listed in menu selection. Played in French with no subtitles.
2,"DISAPPOINTED, SUPPLEMENT FACTS NEED TO BE UPDATED","VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF PROTEIN CONTENT. THE SUPPLEMENT LABEL STATES 2TBS AT 14 GRAMS PROTEIN. UPON RECEIVING IT I FIND IT IS 13 GRAMS FOR 4TBS, QUITE A BIT IN DIFFERENCE. WILL LOOK ELSE WHERE FOR MY SOURCE OF PROTEIN AND BUY IT OTHER THAN AMAZON."
1,In edible,"May be great for you, but as it didn't mix into anything, much too difficult to actually ingest it. It sat like sand in the bottom of the glass. No thanks!"
2,Disgusting After Taste!!,"You know that bitter after taste you get while eating Kashi or drinking Almased?Yup just as gross as that- & I love Kashi, don't get me wrong.Tried it a few different ways: fat free milk, soy milk, vanilla & chocolate SlimFast, filtered Water...Just like Alamsed, that nasty taste cannot be tamed.My taste buds simply disapprove!If you are looking for high protein diet source, I am taking a Multi-Vitamin every day, eating MetRx meal replacement bars: Apple pie flavor washed down with a bottle of Slimfast for breakfast & again for Lunch. Drinking water & eating plain veggies as in between meal snacks followed by a light Dinner of less than 600 calories. I walk the track every other day & have managed to lose 14 pounds in 2 months without ever going to the gym.Good luck to everyone out there."
2,Disappointed. Looks and taste like sand,"I was very disappointed after purchasing and using this product( it only lasted 3 1/2 weeks for me.) Also, there's no mention in the description that it takes 4 spoonfuls of of this powder to equal 1 serving. The texture tastes like sandy water and it doesn't mix very well. It mostly just floats to the bottom( like sand would) and i wont be purchasing this again. I suggest you don't either unless you love the taste of sand in your protein shake. I gave it 2 stars because it's hemp protein, and that's good. But try a different brand."
2,Avoid,"This tastes quite gross. Even at half serving and masked with other strong flavors in a shake, it is nearly inedible."
4,Worth the waiting,Yolandita has returned! It was worth the wait. Sexto sentido is a great album. I love it but specially songs like La luna (remix) and Te vine a buscar. This album is powerful and fresh no much cut veins songs. Excellent job!
2,UNbelievble and boring,The book is interesting historically. I believe the present consensus now is that it is a fraud.Opal is supposedly precocious enough to be able to use the names of historical figures and even use some words in French. Her teachers considered her a genious. What bothers me is her syntax. A child of this breadth of reading would not use syntax which is not the grammar of a normal six-year old. Not even a normal 3 1/2 year old. Definitely an adult trying to imitate baby talk.
2,It's okay...,"In the first episode:Sakura and Julian go to a carnival where the firey card makes trouble.In the second episode:A store sells look alike Clow Cards , but there's a real Clow Card.In the third episode:The snow card buries the town in snow."
5,deadly famiily secrets,"I have not look at it yet, but I saw it before and enjoy it,but will be looking at it soon."
2,Definately Not A Beginner Lesson,"I purchased this for my daughter who is a true beginner on this instrument hoping to give her an introduction. I was looking for the very basics. Unfortunately this DVD assumes you know a great deal about the pedal steel. Bruce jumps right in with exercises, scales, and a song without going into the stuff you need to know first. How to hold the bar (taught about a third of the way in), how to hold the picks, how to pick, how to tune the guitar, how the strings are numbered, how the pedals are numbered, etc (never taught). Early in the tape he freely admits he hopes you have someone in the neighborhood who can teach you. Gee, isn't that why I bought this DVD? You definately need a pause on your remote because Bruce blows through what he is doing in the examples.Very disappointing from a true beginners standpoint. It will benefit the more intermediate player more."
1,Mistaken Identity,"The title of this album is the same as an old vinyl album. That is the reason I bought this. However, the songs are not the same. A big disappointment and waste of money/time."
4,"Lovely, dreamy pop","I was lucky enough to get a preview copy of this disc and found it to be quite enchanting. If the whole Norah Jones chanteuse vibe is your thing, you can't go wrong with this disc."
4,P 90 Workout,"It is a good workout, still a little more advanced than I thought, but I'm out of shape. Glad I didn't get the more extensive one. I can do some of the workouts, not all of them."
1,Good graphics and that is about it.,"on my 50 inch plasma the characret looks very big, to big, so I cannot see anything else. Cannot see who are you fighting very very often if your enamy is behind you ""kind of stupid"".thanks-Mariusz"
1,Jeep should take its name off this horrible bike!,"I bought this bike thinking since Jeep put its name on it then it should be a great, tough, rock solid ride! Boy was I wrong! Not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy, its mechanics are worst part. After taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally, 10 of its gears still don't work. Now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job, let me tell ya, I stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still didn't work. Overall, I'd have to give this bike two thumbs down. You're better off buying a bike from walmart!"
2,Mixed results,I'm not overly fond of anti-siphon valves. I like my valves to include as little features as possible...this because of the expense in repairing them. This one also has the added problem of being a piston valve. Not my favorite. My preference is for diaphram valves. Good thing Rain Bird stands by this.
2,Very Disappointing,I was really disappointed in this book. I loved all of Andre Norton's original Time Traders stories. This one took half the book to just get the story started! Not like my old Andre Norton at all. Spare me any more of these!
2,A Disappointment,"I bought this exercise dvd because I wanted to find a challenging workout that contained cardio, strength, and flexibility options. While I appreciated that I could adapt the workout into separate, 20-minute ones based on my schedule and that there was a modifier available if I wanted to just do a low-impact routine, I just couldn't get into this dvd.First, the warm-up semed too short and I still felt ""cold"" when the actual workout began. Also, I found the cardio boring because it consisted of lots of jumping, squatting, and rather quick kickboxing moves that were hard for me to follow even though I just watched the dvd first. Finally, I found it hard to perform many of the movements without the foam roller that was used in the dvd and thought it would've been nice to see modifications for people who weren't using one.Overrall, I found Voight's The Complete Sleek Workout to be a disappointment and recommend it only for die-hard Karen Voight fans."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was disappointed. I want to be exhausted when I'm done like with the original 6 Firms or Jari Love, etc. but I never got even close. I'm going to still try the 50 min total body workout sometime but the two 20 min WO's I did today (sweat & strength) were not ""time worthy"" and did not push me to the max!"
5,Powerful Story Well Done,"I had been searching for this one for a few years and there it was on Amazon. Steel mills, spoiled rich family members, labor strikes, deaths, immigrants trying to better their lives; what's not to like. Then you have Gregory Peck, Greer Garson, Gladys Cooper, Lionel Barrymore, a young and coldly beautiful Jessica Tandy. It just can't get any better. Any film with Greer Garson is worth the watching. I hope the transfering of classics like these to dvd will continue."
5,An Oldie But a Goodie - One of Greer Garson's Best,"I had this once on VHS and was delighted when it went to DVD. It is one of Miss Garson's best - and with a young, handsome leading man (Gregory Peck), Donald Crisp, a Barrymore and a lovely performance by Gladys Cooper, it can scarcely be bettered.Few contemporary actresses can hold a candle to the likes of Greer Garson, Rita Hayworth, Brenda Marshall, Maureen O'Hara and other 'grand ladies of the cinema' - in their performances, standards, and professionalism.Amazon's shipping was excellent and I received my purchase in good order."
5,The Valley of Decision,"Here again, this has been one of my all-time favorites. I do believe the book was better, went into a lot more detail, but the movie is very special to watch."
4,"Decent Mixer, Excellent Value","I was able to pick up one of these for $50 on sale. Four years later I am still quite happy. It is not perfect, and the rotating mixer bowl can become quite unstable if full, but overall it's still a full stand mixer for well under 100 bucks. The motor has plenty of power to go through thicker doughs, and cleanup is relatively easy. Granted this is NOT in the same class as the top of the line mixers from Kitchen-Aid, Cuisinart, or even the new Kenmore stand mixers, but you'll shell out at least an extra $125-$200 if you want to upgrade to that class. If you are a casual baker and don't need a mixer for everyday use or large demanding jobs, I'd recommend this mixer."
2,Check out for the number 1...,"I think this second compilation from Guidance Records is really less interesting than the first.I love the first,very rarely I'm listening at this one...go out to look for Mundial Muzique Vol. 1,if you haven't it yet."
4,History on Colorado ranching and natural beef program,Story of the Coleman family in Colorado and history of ranching on public lands in the western United States. Very readable history on the family and how the development of the public lands directly affected this family.It gives the history and problems of Mel Coleman's development of a natural beef program.
3,Not bad... but not enough.,"This book will serve it's purpose well for the beginner, it touches some very important and interesting issues that were covered in other books, and the author uses that claim in far too many subjects, in my opinion. It features a lot of text that involves the very important issues of using InterDev, but what about the technologies that make it all work? ASP, VBScript, SQL, ADO, HTML are all beeing discussed, but in a manner to make you ask for more... much more. It's a good book to play a first step, but if controlling InterDev isn't your problem... you'll need another book."
1,Sub Beginner Level,"This book is not worth buying and, if you have any web design experience, not worth reading. It deals with very surface level concepts. It lacks the explination of what is accually happening underneath the WYSIWYG interface."
1,Garbage,Listening to this album makes me want to puke. Sometimes I just want to ignore that they ever made this album and continue listening to the first 2 albums. They have completely gone pop. They went from emo hardcore (very similar sound to Senses Fail) to pure pop garbage (Simple Plan is a very good example of their new sound). Everyone who likes the 'harder' sounding Keepsake i recommend listening to Senses Fail which have not sold out.
2,it was a good thought,"I was very excited to see a Tool tribute album, but very disappointed by the time it was spinning in my cd player. The cd has great intentions..anyone attempting to pay tribute to an amazing band like Tool has great intentions, but these bands have nowhere near the musical creativity and technical talent that Tool has. Granted, their creativity and talent are very rare gifts, but the cd just didn't turn out that well, and doesn't appeal to me at all. My advice is save your money, but if your goal is to own every single piece of merchandise with the word ""TOOL"" on it, go ahead and pick it up. There are a few moments of faint musical enlightenment, but for the most part, I'm not liking this spin on Tool's songs."
2,What is that!!??,What is that? I thought that it'll be a good record. Tool's songs in new arrangements. New look at old songs. But this is [bad]. Some disco beats and [bad] vocals. If u like TOOL DON'T BUY IT!
1,"Yeah, bad idea...","I love Tool, they are by far my favorite band. After buying and liking the string tribute I thought this albumn might be a good idea. Nope. This albumn just plain ... While I support the idea of covering Tool's music I don't support people who have little musical talent trying to do so. I'm serious, some of the songs made me laugh out loud. Aenima was particulary horrid. Most of the others wern't too far off either. The rendition of Stinkfist is acceptable, I liked hearing a female voice covering Maynard. Other than this song and perhaps Prison Sex the rest bite. So save your money, if you are rabid tool fan like me you will most likely not appreciate the desecration of their music."
1,worst tribute ever,This so called tribute is horible it totally takes away from the originality and pure artistry that tool posseses dont waste your time or money.
1,"A tribute?... No, an insult.",This cd is definitely no worth the money you were going to spend or just spent on it. The music is so minimal that insults Tool's artistical greatness. Do not buy this cd if you are a fan of great quality music.1 out of 5 stars.
2,Flat Interpretation...,"This CD does little justice to the depth and atmosphere of Tool. Most of the bands presented on this CD offer mediocre remakes in the Electronica vein of musical genres. Most songs sound flat with very little offered in terms of listening enjoyment.Personally, I would only recommend this CD for fans of both Tool and Electronica. If you are an avid Tool fan, and dislike Electronica (some people call it Techno-rock or even Rocktronica), you should definitely avoid this album. The only reason I gave this CD two stars is because I was able to listen to a few songs--""Die Eier Von Satan"" specifically."
1,Disappointed greatly,"Being a Tool fan, I got this cd thinking that if they went to the trouble to making a tribute cd that it would be good. NO, it was terrible. The best song, which doesn't say much, because it isn't that good was Stinkfist. Everything else was crap, I wasted money, and never listened to the cd all the way through, and never tried to listen to it after the first time I got it.Terrible, just plain terrible."
1,Sounds like a good idea doesnt it?,"A gothic industrial tribute to Tool. Sounds cool enough... until you actually play the cd. What an insult to such an intelligent, and technically and creatively innovative band. This compilation takes the intricate polyrythms, insrumentals, and almost supernatural vocal ability of Tool, and reverts it to insultingly discordant cacophonic vocals over dull dance rhythms and random instrumental noise. I probably won't ever listen this cd again. If you want an amazing tribute album to Tool try ""The String Tribute to Tool: Third Eye Open"" with Piotr Jandula. If you want something new that belongs in an adjacent space on the same shelf next to your Tool cds, then check out the band ""Floater"". Equally as talented, mysterious, and innovative. If you are wanting some cool gothic/industrial, look elsewhere. This cd is utter [junk]."
4,"Titles Mislead, but Films Are Good","The titles of these two films are somewhat misleading -- clearly an attempt to lure viewers into the cinema. There's no vampire in Blood of the Vampire, per se (Maybe why they added an animated bat in an early scene), nor is there nearly as much skin or sin as you'd expect in a flick entitled The Hellfire Club.That said, the two films are well made and quite entertaining. BotV is more in the style of a Hammer Frankenstein film than a Dracula one, and the HC is a Hammer-style swashbuckler. Two very good films to relax with on a rainy afternoon or quiet evening. I hadn't seen them in ages, and enjoyed both.The packaging is good, though it's a bit annoying that there are no direct chapter jumps/menus -- especially since there are drive-in style trailers before the main films and at intermission.Overall, a good product well made, definitely for Hammer fans. Check 'em out."
4,"Forget about ""painless,"" but this is the best I've tried!","Obviously ripping out hair is not going to be painless in the bikini area, face or armpits. You do eventually become a little more able to endure the pulling in these areas, but don't throw away that razor--you're still going to need it!This is an excellent product for making your skin hair-free and super smooth. Be sure to use some sort of product (such as that made by Baxter of California) to help prevent ingrown hairs and red bumps. Lotions claiming to help minimize shaving and hair growth are no match for the Emjoi.One extra bit of advice: Make sure you pull your skin TAUT so that it doesn't get caught in the Emjoi! This is even more important when the charge starts to die off as it seems much easier to get skin caught at that time.Used regularly, you can expect 6-12 months of use from this product before it needs replacement (due to blade dulling)."
3,ark another one!,"the film starts off okay but even that has the 'voice' exposition for a couple of mins.seems a typical 'saturday morning film', nothing deep here and you have your ususal black hat bad guy's.the animation is okay not pixar quality but good enough to tell the story, there's quite a few of these story types closest ones would be 'final fantasy the spirits within' and 'kaena the prophecy' both of which are better films in my opinion...still this one's okay the ending is a letdown really..they just went for the 'transformers ending' which was cheap and tacky...another film in a similar vein and budget was the of Dragons - Fire And Ice which had better storyline and animation.overall it's an okay film, nothing amazing children may like it though i personally think they could have done much more with the story and not opt for the typical/easy story mechanics they used.3 out of 5"
1,How is this funny?,What's next? A book on how to beat your child? A book on how to mutilate female genitalia?This is typical thinking in our society. Men are evil and deserve bad. Women are good and deserve to take out their perceived wrongs on men - no matter how violently.Disgusting.
4,Seems like good plastic clips,"I wanted really big hair clips, because I have a lot of hair. I'm trying not to use chemicals in my hair anymore, so I want to start using good conditioners, but there's no way I'd be able to use anything with my hair flipping and flopping everywhere. They're plastic, but they feel strong, and have a strong grasp. They have little nubs inside, not exactly teeth, just grip nubs. And they're much bigger than I was expecting.Only thing I wish was for 10 dollars, I wish they maybe included more. Even four would have been a better value. But overall, I'd suggest these."
5,Great for drying curly hair,"I use these to clip up small sections of hair at the crown. Then, I use a diffuser to gently dry my hair and give it more curl. The clips at the roots help the hair curl there, because with long, thick, curly hair, the weight of the hair usually pulls the hair straight at the crown. I read about that at another site, don't remember where. These really work."
3,Thick hair beware.,"I was looking for clips to layer off my hair for styling. I saw these with so many good reviews, so I ordered them. However,I suppose because I have such thick hair, it really wouldn't secure my hair, even when using a smaller section. They are much longer than I expected, and they are a little thick for my taste, especially on the bottom. They would be a lot better if they were a little shorter, because then the force of the clamp wouldn't be lost at the ends. If I could get them in my hair, hair towards the end of the clip would fall out because it wouldn't clamp together. A little disappointed, but I'm keeping them because I'm only using it to partition my hair, and not for an actual style."
1,Junk! Might be okay for holding super thin hair.,"These are such a waste of money!! When I got them out of the package they were bent, crooked, the tips stayed open and they wouldn't hold my or my daughters hair. They were flimsy! These are a total waste of money!!!!"
3,"Great graphics, mediocre gameplay","I played this game for an hour at my rich friend's house on his 62' flatscreen HD TV. All I could say about the graphics were, WHOA. however, the gameplay reminds me of black, or killzone without the good story, it just felt as if it missing something. I have played many great shooters, this game however is only worth it for 19.99 or less. (if that is possible for next gen games...). Do yourself a favor and just buy COD, for a low price and superior gameplay."
5,A Review from Someone who Actually owns it,"I got this game today with my PS3. It reminds me a lot of a Doom meets Call of Duty. You're a soldier who is going out to kill some pretty ugly aliens. The gameplay is smooth - the aliens are an easy kill although I am finding health scarce. The graphics are awesome. I have a 720p tv. I know this is going to look sweet to anyone who has a 1080p. The game plays much like a movie, showing off the Blu Ray HD. The load time is fast and I am really happy with it. I own 5 games so far for the PS3 and this one and Call of Duty 3 are my favorites."
2,Wannabe HALO!!!! ... Stop stealing ideas!,"This game is VERY similar to the Xbox game HALO. Since HALO is the best shooter game of all time, it's no surprise that playstation would steel the fad since they don't have any other ideas of their own. This game is ok, but nothing out there really beats HALO."
4,Solid Title,"If you're a shooter fan like me you'll enjoy this game. The graphics are really good. They aren't quite as good as Gears of War, but they're still better than a lot of next gen games. The array of weapons is satisfying and the enemy AI is pretty smart. They really keep you on your toes. I've read most of the back story on the website, which makes the game all that more interesting. If you have a PS3 you really need to get this game."
2,This Is Awful. Just Awful,"this game is crap. and I'm even coming from the whole ""it was made in late-2006"" angle. this game could be average, but the controls and shooting are some of the worst I've ever seen. that puts it down several pegs. I don't even know why it got such good reviews when it came out. bad story, TERRIBLE storytelling, awful controls, bad shooting, frustrating gameplay, lackluster multiplayer, and to top it all off, the game is fairly short. me and a friend co-oped and beat the game on hard in a single 5-hour session.one thing: co-op is hilarious. when you revive your buddy, what the hell are you doing? is it magic? and what's with the sound?! me and several friends all agreed, after spending an hour playing it: this game is crap. don't even bother with it. if the second one is any good, this one destroyed any chance of me buying it."
3,a little abused..,"While the book arrived in the specified time, and is in good condition.. excellent condition actually.. I paid via Amazon $6.93 for the book with Prime shipping... the back of the book has a price tag on it of $3.99... I feel a little ripped off.. the least the company could have done is remove the lower price tag.. sheesh.. I have their name on my ""do not purchase from"" list for reference.."
3,Mixed feelings about this one,"I have found this book to be insightful if you have a very specific question and need a quick and direct answer, but in general this book is way off for tarot meanings.For instance, The Lovers and 2 of Cups are two of the best cards you can get regarding love and romance but in this book under romance and union categories they both have pretty negative interpretations. The Sun is generally a very positive card, but not so in this book.There are also quite a lot of contradictions and it can get quite confusing if you pull a card and just read all of the categories. For example: 8 of wands says that this is a very positive time for romance, but under unions it states that you wont be able to get what you want out of a relationship.One thing I do enjoy about this book is the special guidance section. If I am in need of quick advice it is usually very insightful."
5,Buy This Book,"This is a sure to buy book. Easy to read, follow and understand. Easy for the beginner, and a great gift as well. A good value for the money."
